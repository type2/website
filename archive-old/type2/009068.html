Let's see, &quot;pilot program for accelerated vehicle retirement&quot;.  Sounds
to me like this just _might_ hint at an agenda of &quot;removing vehicles
&gt;from the roads&quot; and I really doubt that they are trying to retire 1999
Acuras!  A &quot;pilot program&quot;, if I know my bureaucracies, almost always
leads to a &quot;large-scale program&quot;

I think that the CARB needs to hire someone who can lie more
effectively.
