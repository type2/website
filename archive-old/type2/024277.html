Go to you post office and get booklet V100 which ex[lains everything clearly. You when you apply for the tax disc declare on form V70 that the vehicle was stored off the public highway (I presume it was). You should have been sent a reminder to re-tax your van which gave you the opportunity to declare the vehicle was off road.

Don't worry yourself sick over it as long as its off the highway when you have no tax disc and don't use it until you have a valid tax disc. I do not think it changes anything if the vehicle is exempt. The law states that every vehicle should display a current tax disc if its on the public hghway.

Any problems call the DVLA on 01792 772134 its their helpline No.
