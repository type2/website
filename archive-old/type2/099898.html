Subject: RE: [VB] lube it or just go at it dry?

Dave, when I was racing at Bonneville in 75 we used zero clearance rings on
bone dry freshly honed cylinders. But this was a first time up the track
race engine and you didn't have 500 miles or so to break in the rings. The
blocks we got from the Windover foundry were cast with no water jacket and
made to use for two or three runs at most.

Lube'm.

I'd love to hear a detailed explaination from builder two, though, as to
why he thinks that oiling the rings and cylinder walls before first-run
would cause the rings to wear out prematurely or to not seat.

Perhaps the only experiance he has with oiled rings is on engines that
were not given a proper breakin?
