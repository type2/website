&gt;It's a very small notch on the rear rim of the pulley. 

No, it's on the FRONT rim of pulley (front as in toward the front of the 
car).  
Just like the oil seal at the flywheel end of the engine is the FRONT 
main oil seal and the oil seal at the fan end of the engine (Type 4) is 
the REAR main oil seal, pretty much opposite of those folks with 
front-engined cars :-)
