I sent them $4 for the catalog.  I had two problems:

1. it took about 1 month (or more) to arive.  How long would a parts order
take?  (it was a xerox of the original catalog, which, I guess, they ran
out of).

2. the catalog has no prices, no price sheet attached either, so while it
has some good pictures and stuff, how am I supposed to know what to order.   

So I called and asked for prices on 1 or 2 things I knew the going rate
for, and found the prices to be higher than expected.

So I woundered what I might buy from them?

They did say the repro side markder lights are $10 lense, base and bulb,
which is a good deal, and I guess for the splitties they have a real cool
'safari' front window insert, but other than unique BB parts, why not go
with Bus Depot?  I couldn't see the advantage.  I'm sure if you are local
to Redding its a great resource.
