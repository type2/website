hi - recently put a new steering box and coupler on the 70, and when i
drove  it, it seemed to wobble just as much!
new german ball joints from wolfgang int (less than 1000 miles on em), no
visible play in any of the linkages, no wobbly bushing on the beam.  tires
were aligned recently, but i may not have put things back exactly where
they were on reassembly.
tires are good, but are only 185/14 passengers, load rate 1500lbs or some
such... i am leaning to them as the culprit, but am fielding other
ideas......
