Subject: Re: [T2] ring &amp; pinion gearset

	I would ask the reasons you're changing your ratio.  Increased crankcase 
stroke?  Different engine?  Different wheels/tires?  If you've added 
horsepower, I would consult a performance transaxle builder on your options. 
  I know FTC and Berg make performance parts in many different combinations. 
  I was at Berg's site looking at them yesterday.

&gt;I need to increase my final drive gear ratio.  Bentley describes &quot;early&quot; 
&gt;and
&gt;&quot;late&quot; ring and pinion gearsets.  I would like to swap my late with a set 
&gt;of early.
