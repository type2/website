Subject: Re: [T2] 73 bus engine sound, oil light

&gt; I hear a knocking sound like a rocker hitting

&gt; valves. Still makes the noise.

first thing I would do it try and isolate the sound. If possible get
one of those mechanic stethoscopes and probe around the engine while
running. Try and determine if it's from the top end of the engine or
located in the case.

&gt; doesn't make the noise at low RPM, but as soon
&gt; as I put a load on the engine, the noise begins
&gt; to gain volume.

sure it's not an exhaust leak?
 
&gt; after checking valves, oil light has come on
&gt; a few times. Plenty of oil in the case.

does the light come on when driving down the road? or is it at hot
idle. 
 
&gt; when I changed the oil last week, there were
&gt; chunks of valve cover gasket in the oil
&gt; screen (any other engine gaskets made of cork?)

I bet you are correct, but it could have been there for a long time,
unless you just recently checked the screen.
 
&gt; the bus is new to me, the valve cover gaskets
&gt; were in OK condition when I bought it. No chunks
&gt; out of them. It looks nice and clean under
&gt; the covers.... hmm. no oil dripped out when
&gt; I checked the valves. Is this normal on these
&gt; engines? I know the type II engines have oil
&gt; sitting in the cover when you remove it, and
&gt; it makes a mess.

it really depends on how the engine is sitting. Oil makes it up to the
rockers and then runs back to the case through the push rod tubes. I
have had the occasional time to not have any oil drip right out of the
head, but it is very rare. Was there at least some oil sitting in the
head that looked as if it was somewhat recently deposited?

&gt; Perhaps the previous owner had a valve cover gasket
&gt; blow, and chunks got in the engine? Blocking oil
&gt; passages in case, not allowing oil to flow to the
&gt; oil pressure sensor? This engine has an oil
&gt; filter.

I wonder, did this start after the oil change? You might want to take
the oil filter back off and just confirm it has oil inside it
(hopefully indicating oil flow in the engine) If you have a blocked
passage the only correct way to fix it is to do a tear down and
inspect, but lets' hope it's something else.
