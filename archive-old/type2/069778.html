Subject: Why does 2nd gear lock up in 75 bus?

I got a 75 bus for $700 (good shape, only 60K. but second gear LOCKS UP-
shift in, car stalls, Shift in before starting and letting clutch out
stalls car- any idea what's wrong before I end up switching the trans?
According to PO he got a trans from Calif. after 2nd gear went out before-
I find this hard to believe with only 60K on the car- perhaps it's
something simpler, like the shift aduster plate under lever???   Any tran
experts out there?     Mike Benthin in NJ
