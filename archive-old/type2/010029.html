&gt; The EGR light on my 1978 Westy has just come on at
&gt; 104,000 miles.  What does it mean?  What must I do
&gt; to get it to turn off?
&gt; 

This was one of the small things I had to figure out
on my 78. Remove the drivers side kick panel. The
speedometer cable is connected to a black box. Push
the little white button on this box, and the light
shouldn't go back on for another 30,000 miles.

Hope this helps
