Barry,

It appears that the locations of Trak Auto stores were bought by Advance.
See:
http://www.potomacnews_dot_com/news/archive/MGBAZX20X6D.html
for details.

Since Trak went into bankruptcy, they no longer exist and they
are no longer around to honor their warrantees.  If it's a house brand,
you may be out of luck.  OTOH, if it is a national brand, then the
manufacturer, operating thru Advance, should honor the manufacturer's
warrantee.
