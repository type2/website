My guess is that's is for the rear window defogger. Is the knob green
with a little coil symbol on it? Are the wires heavy gauge? If so,
bingo!

&gt; Hi list,
&gt; 
&gt; I have been removing some of  the dash wiring today in anticipation of
&gt; replacing the front panel and came across something that strikes me as a
&gt; bit odd. There are three different switches upfront. The light switch, the
&gt; hazard light switch and a third. This one has never worked and so I don't
&gt; know what it did. Today I found it has only two wires, a live red which
&gt; goes to the fusebox and a brown, that later becomes blue with red spots.
&gt; This second wire goes up the side of the windscreen and then down towards
&gt; the back of the bus. The PO though  must have thought it was useless as
&gt; they cut it. What is it? Where does it go? It is a 73 westy, British
&gt; registered. Any ideas?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
