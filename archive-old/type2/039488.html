I have built a blower system for the heat/defrost system using the blower
from an A/C unit.   
  kinda hard to describe but I mounted the A/C blower where the glove box
is, built a plenum and then ducted the air through two ducts (truck flex
exhaust pipe) to a gas heater under the front and then back into the
regular heat duct just behind the front axle.  seperate switches for the
heater and the blower..._dot_can use the blower without heat but can't turn on
the gas heater without the blower being on.

windshield stays clear in all weather but it was a lot of work
