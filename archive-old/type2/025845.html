People plug them up because the diaphragms rupture and new units are almost
unheard of. In the archives is an undated article--judging by the server we
were running out of at the time, this is circa 1997, I'd be interested to
know if this service still exists:

&gt;&gt; A while back someone recommended H&amp;R Booster (actually it's H&amp;R
&gt;&gt; Automotive Parts) in Dallas to rebuild brake boosters.  I sent one to Ron
&gt;&gt; over night, he sent it out today.  Total cost including COD and overnight?
&gt;&gt; $105.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Here are the numbers: Kustom1 Warehouse:  714-997-9893 H&amp;R:   972-286-5516

Frank E Biffath II sez:

&gt; understand the servo works on a vacuum, should be connected to my
&gt; manifold for proper operation.  (71 Westy)  In crawling under I find the
&gt; vacuum hose plugged off.  It doesnt seem to be connected.  So how do I
&gt; troubleshoot?  The brakes do not have any power, they seem to be
&gt; dragging.  Bad servo?  Is the servo even connected or necessary?  Bad
&gt; master cylinder?
