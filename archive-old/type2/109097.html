Wow! This must be a pretty special bus if youre willing to ship from
Australia. What year is it? What website is it on?

&gt; Hi all,
&gt;      I live in the states and am looking at purchasing a bus in Australia.
The owner has one picture on the website, but I was hoping to get more
photos and have a second opinion on its condition. Is anybody willing to
check out a bus for me?
