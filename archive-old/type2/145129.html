Subject: Re: [T2] oe tail pipe in seattle?

Yeah, the three hole flanged type as indicated in picture 'B' of your link.
  I see it is $14.95 from California import parts (Cip1_dot_com) and the are the closest to me: Blaine, Wahington.  I was wondering if anybody has one on the shelf locally in the Seattle to Everett area.

    72-74 or the replacement style muffler using the 3 hole flanged tailpipe on the right side of the muffler?  Makes a difference. 
   
   
  For the replacement style see my link:
