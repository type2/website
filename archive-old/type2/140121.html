Subject: Fwd: [T2] Battery Drain

Bradford: Do you have an ammeter that you can put in series with the 
battery? Most ordinary hand held multi-meters have an ammeter 
function. Mine has a 0 - 10A range that is just right for the 
following test.

Leave the engine off during this exercise.

Disconnect the wire that connects the negative terminal of the 
battery to chassis ground. Temporarily insert the ammeter between 
terminal and ground, using extra wires with clip leads.

You are now reading all current flowing in the battery circuit. If 
the meter reads zero or just a few tens of milliamps, this is as it 
should be. (some radios draw this much current to maintain station 
settings.) If the meter reads a lot more than this, you need to 
isolate the circuit that is allowing this flow.  If you read several 
amps, you have definitely located the cause of your battery drain 
problem.

Isolate the circuit by removing fuses, one at a time. After each is 
removed, check the ammeter reading again. If the current drops after 
a particular fuse is removed, you have identified the hurting circuit.

Next, delve into the circuit diagram for your vehicle in Bentley. 
Trace out the circuit that contains the fuse that you just 
identified.  Stare at the wires in this circuit, poke them with a 
dowel, etc until you find the component that is causing the above 
normal current flow.
