&gt; I've been toying with the idea of running a small water line from my

&gt; compartment
&gt; would be one of those mister nozzles that are sold in kits for
&gt; cooling off
&gt; large outside areas.  If I remember correctly these nozzles pass
&gt; about 3
&gt; gallons per hour.  These nozzles create a very fine mist that would
&gt; insure no
&gt; areas in the engine compartment get totally wet.  Anyway, I imagine
&gt; that on a
&gt; 100 degree day that wouldn't be a problem anyway.  If mounted
&gt; correctly, the
&gt; fan would probably suck all the mist through the cooling system. 
&gt; Would this
&gt; nozzle pass enough water to effect a 20 degree drop in temperature? 

I doubt that the nozzle would supply enough water to drop the
temperature that much.  The fan moves a _lot_ of air, and the mist
nozzles are really meant to work on relatively slow-moving volumes of
air.

It's an interesting idea, and if someone can supply me with the flow
rate of the cooling fan at cruising speed, I can calculate the water
flow required to effect the desired temperature drop.
