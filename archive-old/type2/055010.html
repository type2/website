Subject: Re: Observations on Bus Owners Driving Techniques

Jen,
Here's how I'm usually shifting in my '76 westy:

first  0 to 10-15
second 10-15 to 20-25
third  20-25 to 40-50 (yes it does go that high)
fourth 40-50 to 80-85 (96 downhill :)

That's what I can remember off the top of my head.  What you gotta do is
feel the power range of the engine.  If you shift too soon, you'll
notice that the car won't pull very well in the next gear.  It's kinda
like trying to start from a standstill from idle.  Doesn't pull too well
&gt;from 1000RPMs(that's the usual idle) does it?  But, when you give it
some gas, you're running around 1500-2000 (I don't have a tach either)
which has more power and is therefore able to pull the car from a
standstill better.

So if when you are shifting you're hitting those real low RPMs in the
next gear and it's not pulling well, then give it some higher RPMs in
the previous gear.  In other words, gauge how high to rev the engine
based on the how much power you want in the next gear.  If you're going
up a hill, it's going to have to be higher because the engine needs even
higher revs to pull the weight uphill.  If you're going downhill, you
probably notice you can shift really fast, and probably get to fourth
gear by 30.

Hopefully that makes sense :)

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; Glad this topic came up. I'm a new bus driver and I don't know how/when to
&gt; shift. We don't have a tach yet and I'm trying to shift based on the sound
&gt; of the engine while driving and how much power it gives me after I shift.
&gt; I'm mainly shifting based on VW's recommendations but then in the Muir book
&gt; they say to stay in third until 45 miles per hour! Sounds like the engine is
&gt; going to explode or something but it could be just the echo inside the bus
&gt; that I'm not used to... I have no idea.
&gt; 
&gt; I have to say that I do 'push' the bus more than my guy who babies it to the
&gt; point where drivers are ready to ram us from behind. I'm always saying
&gt; &quot;uh... you CAN go a LITTLE faster...&quot;  I feel that doing 5 miles under the
&gt; speed limit while traffic is doing an average of 10 miles OVER it is a bit
&gt; dangerous. Now that I've got the hang of driving the bus it is really fun
&gt; and not so scary anymore. She does have some pep but it scares me to rev it
&gt; so high before shifting. I know it's bad for the engine to shift too early
&gt; though. Can you guys tell me at what speeds you shift at to help me out?
&gt; Maybe I can overcome this fear. What RPMs are recommended for the type 2
&gt; 1600 engine?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Jen :-)

&gt; &gt;These folks observed a max. shift point RPM of
&gt; 2500. Always. Then claimed that the eng. was not rebuilt correctly as it
&gt; &quot;lacked power&quot;. When I attemped to explain that they had just begun to get
&gt; into the power band at 2500RPM, &gt;  [snip]
