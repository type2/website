Subject: Oil filter goes downstream of aux. oil cooler. Why?
Message-Id: &lt;Pine.OSF.3.91.990610210428.21789B-100000_at_humdinger.geog.ucsb_dot_edu&gt;

The anniversary edition of the Idiot Guide notes that when installing an 
auxilliary oil cooler on a bus to supplement the stock one the oil filter 
should go downstream of the cooler, not upstream of it. But it offers no 
advice as to why this is optimal. 

The general strategy for a 2.0L engine is to install a piece where the
stock oil filter goes that has nipple connectors for oil out and oil back
in. Then run hoses to a convenient and effective location (much discussion
about where this is) and run oil through an auxilliary oil cooler, then
through an externally mounted oil filter, then back in. One could put the 
filter upstream or downstream of the cooler. 

I would think that upstream the oil is hotter, therefore thinner. It might
pass through the filter with less resistance (and therefore pressure
drop?) than it would if it were located downstream of the cooler where the
oil is cooler, therefore thicker. 

But the good book says to put the filter downstream of the cooler,
intercepting cooler, thicker oil. And I generally only contradict the good
book when a smart VW mechanic who is wise in the way tells me why I
should. So, you smart VW mechanics wise in the way, why might downstream
be the best place for an oil filter? I wonder if it really matters much. 
It would be easy to switch the orientation by switching the hoses at the 
source.

PS- My auxilliary oil cooler helps me run a good 30 degrees F cooler than 
I did before installing it.
