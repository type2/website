Subject: Upstairs cot

&quot;Ah, yes, the dreaded &quot;PUNISHMENT COT&quot;.  I removed and stored mine.  Has
any adult amongst us actually slept in one of these?  Have you recovered
from it?&quot;

Back some years ago, my second bus, a 71 rustfalia, had one of these. 
I was on a trip from Minneapolis to Chicago to see the Dead.  My wife 
and I got the downstairs bed, my wifes short girlfriend got the 
childs cot, and  265 lb 6' tall Football buddie got the upstairs cot. 
Middle of the first night camping, a terrible noise awakens us all 
and a giant rump was hanging out of a rended 25 year old canvas cot. 
Quite the scene!

wes,
bamf 71 riv.
