I have one of these styles.  Be warned, the capacity (5000 BTU Panasonic)
is not really up to the job.  It helps though, and would probably work a
lot better if my bus were insulated.  If you get one, try to go for 7000+
btu, but remember that more BTU = heavier and bulkier.  My advice is to
STAY AWAY from Carrier brand units.  I've seen several that didn't work
worth a darn, including a couple of floor models.
