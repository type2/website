Subject: Fuel leak in Josie's carb ('74 Westy)

Hi all,

The saga continues.  I am still stumped by Josie's coughing and sputtering.
I can;t seem to get it right.  Then this morning my wife went out to her
car to go to wrok and came back in to tell me there was a large pool of gas
on the driveway behind the van.  So I went out to look and found fuel
dripping from the right carb down onto the tin and through to the ground.
It looks like the leak is coming from around the throttle lever.  So
there's another task I need to undertake.  I guess I should take a closer
look and then remove the carb and replace the faulty component(s).  I have
a spare set of carbs but the PO said one was leaking.  I wish I could find
a good set of used carbs that I could depend on functioning properly.

On the advice of a few who responded to my post last week I tried to
readjust the timing and point gap to different positions but it didn;t make
a difference in performance.  Is it possible that a too rich mixture could
cause the coughing and sputtering I get when I accelerate the engine?  I
thought it would be too lean a mixture causing this but the tailpipe itself
and the bumper just above the tail pipe are really black, indicating a rich
mixture.  Also my plugs were really black when I took them out, although i
had been idling the engine a fair bit while trying the timing and points
adjustments.  Could valve timing cause this problem?

For the benefit of those who missed my original post I have included it below.

Thanks for any and all help.

&gt;I am having a problem with Josie in a particular RPM range that continues
&gt;to puzzle me. First let me say that I know there are a number of 009
&gt;detractors out there who will advise me to get rid of the thing, however,
&gt;for the time being at least, my stubborn side believes that there must be
&gt;a way to tune th eengine to allow acceptable performance.  I say this
&gt;because I had Josie running really well last summer until early fall when
&gt;things started going sour.

First the engine details;

1974 campmobile
1700 cc rebuilt with about 10,000 miles
stock carbs PDSIT 2-3(can't remember jetting details, except pilot jets are 55)
009 distributer
FACET electric fuel pump recently remounted below tank under frame with
small in-line paper filter between tank outlet and pump
S&amp;S extractor - no heater boxes (straight pipes)
timing - 16 degrees BTDC for total advance of approx. 36 degrees
dwell set to 50 degrees
all valves adjusted to .006&quot;
plugs - Bosch W7CC

The story is that between 2000 and 3000 approx. the engine runs very rough,
missing badly, untill I step on the throttle hard, then I get all the power
I want.  If cruising the town road at 30 MPH in third gear the engine
misses badly with the occasional &quot;pop&quot; on deceleration.  Idle is not too
bad, little high, which I attribute to the advance timing.  As I said this
set up was working well until last fall when I noticed that at low fuel
levels the engine would start to die at high speed.  I thought this might
be due to fuel pumpo being mounted in engine compartment so remounted it
beneath tank outlet and put filter between tank and pump. This seemed
better but still noticed a problem so installed a smaller fitler thinking
the fuel was being pushed out of the pump faster than the filter could fill
up.  I can still hear the pump working which makes me wonder if I should
take the filter and place it between pump and carbs and leave straight hose
between tank and pump.

The mystery to me is that when I step on it I have lots of power.  I am
begining to wonder if I need to experiment with the point gap and timing to
get this right.  Just last week I checked the dwell and it was at about 46
degrees.  So I figured, hey, that must be the problem!  But when I reset
dwell to 50 degrees, the problem got worse.

I am beginning to wonder if I'll ever get this right.  I need someone with
experinece using this kind of set up to help.&gt;

Thanks,
Ron
