&quot;Zoltan&quot; &lt;zol_at_foxinternet_dot_net&gt;: asked me to forward this to the type 2 lists

&gt;
&gt;This is a 1.8 or 2.0 engine with a single carburetor in the middle.  It is
&gt;complete in every way except the muffler is missing.  But the whole engine
&gt;with crank, cam, block, pistons, liners, heads, alternator, fan with shroud,
&gt;double pulley, all the tins, and the heat exchangers.  I just don't need it.
&gt;Zoltan
&gt;I am in the Seattle area.


Evidently he's giving this engine away or close to it.

Email him!!!!!!
