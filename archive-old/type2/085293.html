Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Build

Hiya Simon,

Sorry to hear about Speedy.

I was just talking to Bill Nothstine (also a List member), like us, a 1970 
owner, and he has been running a new Mexican engine for quite some time now 
and he gives it a definite thumbs up.  All new parts put together by people 
who know what they're doing.  Hard to beat that.  And that's probably why a 
class act like John Conally over at Aircooled_dot_net carries them.
