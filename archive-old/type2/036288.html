Subject: 73 Westy for sale...SOLD!!

Hello everyone!!

 Well, I sold the 73 to a new list member, Chris Swindell. I appreciate the
responses I got about the bus, and I truly was sad to see it go, but I
believe that Chris will provide all the love and care she needs!!

 This also gives me the opportunity to get started on my 82 Westy that has
been sitting forlorn in the back yard. First thing that it is getting a  new
head, fuel line swap, and tune up.

 Thanks once again to everyone who responded!!
