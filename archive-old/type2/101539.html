Subject: Re: [T2] Bosch WR1

that is exactally how i mounted the WR-1 i got from bus depot on my 71. the 
wires are long enough to go right thru the stock grommet. i no longer have a 
voltage reg. mounted (alt. intalled) it makes for a real nice and dry 
install.



&gt;found a post that said to mount
&gt;it in the engine compartment where it's already dry instead of drilling a
&gt;hole in the body to mount it (among other suggestions).
&gt;
&gt;I was thinking of mounting the relay from one of the screws holding the
&gt;voltage regulator to the firewall.
