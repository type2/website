Subject: The Original &quot;Grendel&quot;

 I keep meaning to ask about the name &quot;Grendel&quot;.

 It's from mythology as I recall. Anyone got a &quot;good&quot; encyclopedia?

 Some late news just in: 

 In Finland the police are experimenting with a harpoon on the cop car.

 They just harpoon the offending speeder and haul him in on a cable.
  I like it! :-)

 Then we come to the more sinister news: 

 In a place called Broome, Australia, camels carrying tourists are
now required to have a tail-light after dark.
