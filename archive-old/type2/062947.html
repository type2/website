Subject: Re: VW bus model kit

So Robin Schectman says:
&gt; 
&gt;    Do you have any idea where I might get a model kit of a VW 
&gt;    bus?  My 13-year old daughter has fallen in love with them 
&gt;    and she's a bit young for the real thing.  The local hobby 
&gt;    and toy stores don't have any.  Please post response directly to me at
&gt;    Robin_Schectman_at_unc_dot_edu.  Thanks.

I have a better solution.  Why don't you get her an old starter or
alternator and see if she can take it apart, clean it, test it/fix it
and put it back together.  Too much?  Hmmmm.... How about showing
her how to check/change the oil, replace the fan belt and/or adjust the
valves?  It really depends on how industrious she wants to get.
Just because she can't drive or own one, doesn't mean she can't
start learning how to work on and understanding one.

Cheers!
