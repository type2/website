Subject: Re: [T2] Carburetor assembly adhesive?

I would assume an epoxy type of adhesive would do the trick.  You could 
either add the epoxy-weld with the orifice tube in place, or you could add a 
bit, and then drill it out to an interference-fit.  A third option would be 
to have it bushed at a carburaetor shop.

&gt;Hi,
&gt;I'm trying to maintain a 30+ year-old Solex carb. Specifically, what is the 
&gt;best way to secure the accelerator pump injector (the goose-neck brass 
&gt;tube) into its hole in the pot metal of the carb body? The hole is enlarged 
&gt;to the point where the tube is no longer a press fit, and so the tube tends 
&gt;to vibrate loose and fall down the throat of the carb. Is there a 
&gt;fuel-proof adhesive, or should I bend the tube slightly to get it to wedge, 
&gt;or?
&gt;Any suggestions from the list would be most appreciated.
&gt;Roland
