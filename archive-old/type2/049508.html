Subject: [T2] RE:Driving in the snow

Re: Driving in the snow: I'd suggest a bit of practice. 
Go to a large empty snow covered parking lot, and 
practice pulling  away, stopping, and most important
some skids and donuts. Do it slow say 15-20MPH. 
Stomp the gas until the rear end starts to swing, and then try to fix it.
Try stopping as fast as you can.
Now try stopping faster than that and learn to recover the from the skids.
Try stopping in a turn.
NOTE: MAKE SURE YOU LEAVE ROOM FOR SOME SPINS.
KEEP WELL AWAY FROM THE LIGHT POLES!!!
You may want to steer a bit one way to allow you 
to predict which way the back end will swing.
It will swing away from the turn. 
To recover steer towards the way the back end is going. 
You've got the get the front end to catch up with the backend
sideways that is to stop the skid.


What is a donut? GO try it and you'll be able to tell me;-)
