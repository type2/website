George sez,

&gt;Another minus is that it's difficult to make paint stick to the case.  My
&gt;ill-fated GEX engine was painted (badly) and the paint peeled from the
&gt;sump in strips.


This is the bit that bothers me about all this, if the interface between the
case and paint is imperfect (how can it be otherwise) then surely a loss of
effective heat transmission follows. I would be seeking truly expert advice
here before risking the loss.
