Subject: Re: Part # for front beam seals

I previously said:

&gt;The number is 211 405 129A
  and
&gt;I think that defines a set of four

No, that is the part number for just one seal.  I've noticed that the
Bus Depot's on-line catalog shows that number for pre-'68 buses, but I'm
confident that it is correct for loafs since I got that number off an
original seal on my '78.
