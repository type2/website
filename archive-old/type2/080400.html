Subject: tales from the snow

Let me get mine:

Sequoia Nat'l Park, California about two years ago. Me, the wife and two little ones and our friend Joe in the 76 hardtop camper in december. Joe is operating from the lawn (bombardier) chair in the middle of the bus.

Heading up to the park is no problem, snow on the ground and falling light, but roads are being used and it's drying up.

Coming down late in the day it was not the case. Chains on, 2nd gear creeping at 10mph I feel the steering turn to Jelly. We're at 7000 thousand feet and the bus is preparing to slide off a mountain road to a 1-2000 ft drop.

Wife and I are looking at each other, it's slow motion.

Fortunately, through mild steering control and brake pumping, a snow bank stops up before the unthinkable, but we are stuck. 

&quot;Get the kids out of the bus!&quot;

Guy and girl in a burly 4wd toyota pickup stop and offer to pull us out. He puts it in reverse, and spins. He can't even back up the hill much less pull us anywhere.

He and Joe get on the front of the bus and give a gentle push while I rev it and all I can say is thank god for the weight of the engine over the rear wheels!

Billy
