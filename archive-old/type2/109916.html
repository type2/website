Subject: Re: [T2] Part needed, stub axle

Hi Den

What I have done for racers....
take a beetle stub axle, turn off the CV flange
turn it down to a size you have a drill bit for,, say 1&quot; for example
take a piece of 3/8&quot; plate and drill a 1 &quot; hole in it
press fit this plate on the stub axle
weld it on
put it in the lathe to &quot;face&quot; the plate, and make it round to fit the CV
you can style it like a bus stub if you feel artistic
mark the CV mounting hole bolt circle while in the lathe
clean up the welds while in the lathe

drill and tap the CV mounting holes in the plate

Instead of the 3/8&quot; plate, You could substitute a real bus cv flange
parted off a bus stub axle,,, I never had access to one of those when I
was racing..

&gt; the stub axles is bent enough to possibly be the cause of a fatigued

&gt; to start with...
&gt;
&gt; The bearings are beetle IRS,

&gt; bus stub axles are too thick to fit through the beetle bearings...
