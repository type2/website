Subject: Re: CB Radios

I used to mount my Sharp on top of the dash with a couple of skinny
bolts through the radio speaker holes (no speaker there).

George Lyle sayeth:

&gt; It is quite important that you mount the antenna to the roof, as
&gt; mounting the antenna to the side of the bus will reduce your radiated
&gt; power by quite a bit.

Location on the car matters, too, if I recall correctly.  If the antenna
is at the rear of the car, your range is stronger towards the front, and
vice versa.

&gt; OK, assuming that you do all of the above, what kind of performance can
&gt; you expect?  In open terrain (line of sight) you might get a mile or
&gt; two of range.  In the mountains it will drop to a half-mile or so.
&gt; Don't expect too much of a CB!

True, but in optimal situations your range can be much higher than 2
miles.  5 miles was not unusual in my old MG with the Sharp 23-channel;
sometimes at night, parked (no ignition noise), I could hold
conversations with people 10-15 miles away.  This was in the &quot;flat&quot;
north Florida hills.  Other days, when &quot;skip&quot; is bad and you're hearing
idiots with linear amps from half a continent away (&quot;How 'bout it,
skipland, skipland, skipland!&quot;), it might be irritating to maintain
contact down the street.

George is very correct on the antenna length issue, and you might do
well to get help there if you don't have an SWR meter (locals can borrow
mine :).  The length of the antenna and cable should be physically -- or
electronically, through a &quot;tuner&quot;, but that's less effective -- matched
to some multiple of the wavelength for CB (10 meters) to get a standing
wave ratio closest to 1:1.

I still have my Sharp; 25 years old and going strong.  I've got it
hooked up in the shop and sometimes listen in on the truckers.  Some
things have changed -- &quot;Driver&quot; instead of &quot;Good Buddy&quot;, etc. -- but not
much.  I keep toying with the idea of putting it in my 71 Westy.
