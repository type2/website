Vanagons have 6 digit odometers. So it should say 093000. However....the
plastic drive gear cracks and then slips on the shaft. The speedometer will
work and give an accurate speed but the odometer won't register any miles or
km.

US uses psi figures for compression. 125-140 is very good, 100 is minimum.
Metric is bar figures. 1 bar is one atmosphere of pressure. Close conversion
is 15 psi = 1 bar. 7 bar X 15 = 105 psi.

&gt; I am having a compression test done on a 81 camper before I buy it. I
&gt; am having the test done at a vw dealer that has nothing to do with
&gt; the sale. How should I interpret the results. I am in Denmark, so it
&gt; will probably be in metric readings? The seller tells me that the
&gt; camper has only been used in the summer and placed in storage during
&gt; the winter, and has only been driven 93,000 KM. I figure it could be
&gt; 193,000 KM just as well, and this is why I'm having the test done.
