Subject: Re: [T2] starts but dies?  78 westy

Does the bus run once it's warmed up? or does it just die now all the time
if you let up on the accelerator? If it dies only while warming up, you may
have accidentally bumped the electric connection to the cold start valve
(which is really just another fuel injector buried under the plumbing
roughly in the centre of the engine top area. Look around for a loose wire;
my next guess is that you have accidemntally knocked a vacuum connection off
 there are many of them, start checking along them for a disconnected one. I
think you will find you have missed one.

Hi!

The bus was running fine before I cleaned and gapped the plugs. We are
taking
a trip next week so I thought I would clean them up. The plugs looked great
when they came out, good color...

Now the bus is very hard to start and once started will not stay running
without keeping the accelerator 1/2 down or so. Even then, it doesn't
maintain rpms. let up and it dies.

I have checked all the vacuum lines and wires, they are all good. Honest all
I did was clean the plugs? Anybody have suggestions? places to start?

TIA
