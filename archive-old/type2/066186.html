Subject: Bubble Camper Int. in a Splittie?

Hi All,

Has anyone retrofitted a Bubble Window Camper interior (68-79, but I
have a 71 from James Brill) into an early or late Splittie Bus, or know
of someone who has?  I'm not concerned about the pop-top stuff, just bed,
table, rear facing seat etc.  I have either a 66 (wide rear hatch) or a 63
(narrow rear hatch) splittie bus that could use a decent Camper interior.

I know the rear cusion is longer and the top of the engine compartment may
have a heighth variance.  Just curious to get some feedback on this. 8-)
