ok...what the hell?
How come nobody that I've talked to has the cap for their water
resevoir  in their bus??  I don't have this either...
if anyone has a spare cap and/or resevoir it would be greatly
appreciated if they would p-mail me!  I know this seems tacky....but
original equiptment is nice!

oh yeah...I have a 71 westy in wisconsin
