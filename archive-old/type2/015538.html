If I was u, I would take it back and explain, &quot;Jeeze, this isn't running
right. Could you 'untune' it so it runs at least as good as it did before
you fiddled with it???&quot;

Better yet, find a mechanic who won't do &quot;tune ups&quot; but will follow
Bentley, RE: MAINTENANCE INSPECTIONS. The mechanic should always drive the
vehicle BEFORE and AFTER working on it to confirm results before returning
the vehicle as &quot;fixed&quot;.

If it was running too rich, he would have seen it as carbon fouling on the
plugs. Also, if he was following procedure, the mixture would have been set
per spec, keeping in mind compression balance and also with fresh oil. If
you don't have these things in mind, you get &quot;tuned out&quot; not &quot;tuned up&quot;.

&gt;Just got my 76 bus back from the shop after a complete tune-up.  He did a
&gt;valve job points etc.
&gt;I also had him check the emisions because it seemed to be running rich, he
&gt;leaned up the mixture right before I left and I drove home, barely, it has
&gt;no power like it did on the way there.  Do I need a new fuel injection thing
&gt;or just the needs to tune it bettter?  what happened?   I wish I knew how to
&gt;do this myself, any pointers?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
