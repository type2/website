Subject: 2WD to 4WD conversion

hello all,

heres what i'm wondering. would it be possible to get
a viscous coupling and some half axles and convert
your 2WD bus into a Syncro? does this work even in
theory? i know that the first syncro prototype was a
bus, so it must be possible, right? i assume you would
most likely need the tranny from a syncro as well.
could you modify your existing tranny? any thoughts,
feedback? no riots please.
