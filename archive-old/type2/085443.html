Subject: Re: [T2] wiring terminals - adding a wire

H Steven Dolan sends:

&gt; In most FLAPS you can buy what are commonly called &quot;vampire&quot; or Scotchlok
&gt; connectors.  Many radios, etc. come with them in the installation kit.
&gt; IMNSHO... THESE ARE A BAD IDEA!!!!  If you don't know what they look like
&gt; see:

Those things caused two electrical fires on vehicles I've owned. Thank you
Mr. Kidde for saving my butt!

Concur with Steven's double-prong push-on suggestion...hell, cutting the
wire you're attaching to and splicing the additional wire in is better than
Scotchlok connectors. Any home warehouse or hardware store, Wal-Mart-style
store, FLAPS or electrical supply store has wire nuts. Use 'em and be happy.
