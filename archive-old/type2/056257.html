Subject: RE: poor fit of WCM outside scrapers with trim

I just spent a whole day refitting the cab doors on my bus.  I used the
genuine (Brazilian) inner and outer scrapers.  They seem to fit just
right and the quality is good, but there is a slight gap between the
outer scraper and the window.  This might be to do with the new door
skins though - on the RHS the holes for the spring clips to go into were
about 1/4&quot; out so I had to take the clips out and rely on the stiffness
of the scraper to hold it in place.
I wasn't too happy with the fit of the felt channel - I know not of its
origin but it came as a length for each door cut from a reel.  It was
impossible to bend it round the corner of the window without it getting
twisted and kinked.
The windows are quite hard to wind up even though I cleaned and greased
the mechanism well.  I am attributing this to the fact that I have got
used to using electric windows :)
I too used the WCM vent wing seals.  Needless to say, the windows don't
close all the way.  I don't think there is any part of my doors that
won't leak.  I am going to rustproof the inside of the panels well and
keep those drain holes clear.
On a related note, what is to stop me from sticking a PE sheet to the
back of the door panel rather than the door itself?  Would be easier
from a maintenance point of view.
