&lt;&lt; And while I'm on the subject, carry a quality fire extinguisher with you
always.  Many 
 people still do not.  Foolish.  Most engine fires can be put out
quickly...but not 
 with a shirt being fanned on it because a shirt was the only thing
available.

Let me second that! (or third or fourth...)  I carry one in my '75 Westy ever
since barely avoiding a leetle fire in the engine compartment (no damage
done, my mechanic HAD an extinguisher!).  My daughter does not carryone.
After all, she drives a Merc Topaz, safe, reliable, etc...  Last week the
distrib caught fire, and before the fire dept arrived, every single piece of
rubber and plastic under that hood had melted or burned to ash.  You DO NOT
have to drive a veedub for this bit of equipment to be an invaluable part of
your tool kit.  It could have saved her ride.
(the Merc is not salvageable... so now she wants a bug!!)
