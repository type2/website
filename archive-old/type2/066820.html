Subject: VW Dreams

There must be something about this list ... A couple of weeks ago I had a
long and involved dream that my husband was flooding the engine on my
Vanagon and not believing that was the reason it wouldn't start. Then I had
a dream that my father bought a bright red convertable Beetle, and I spent
the night driving it around Mt. Pleasant, SC. The latest dream had my
husband buying me a bright red convertable Beetle on the second floor of a
department store (boy, is it ever hard to test drive a car in a dept. store)
- -- and he bought it even though the cost was $2000. over market value.
Thanks to the melatonin I take to sleep these dreams are long and quite
detailed -- I've almost had as much fun as if I really were driving a Beetle
all night. &lt;g&gt;

Love, Lotus (Flower of the North)
