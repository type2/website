Subject: RE: [T2] new starter and still no start!

If you can't turn it by hand, don't use the starter...you'll burn it out.
You need to figure out why it's not turning freely. Forget about starters
and points; nothing electrical could cause the engine itself to jam. You
need to get the engine to the point where you can turn it by hand (with a
wrench on the alternator bolt):

1) Make sure it's in neutral
2) Did you actually try turning the engine with the starter removed?
3) Did you by chance try turning the engine _after_ you bolted the tranny
on? Maybe there was some kind of clutch issue?

You could try loosening the bolts that hold the tranny &amp; engine together,
pry them apart a little, wiggle, then retorque.

If all that fails, maybe you need to drop the engine, take off the tranny
and check out the clutch. Did you put the pressure plate in the right way?
(I don't know if that would cause binding?)

Worst case, some bolt or tool got into maybe an intake valve or the case and
has jammed. save this for last, Unless you're unexplicably missing a small
tool :O(

&lt;SNIP&gt;
well i have loosened the tranny bolts put a new starter on and have changed
the ignition coil ....
the points is the only thing i can think it can be..
maybe they are off causeing it to not turn over is this possible..

the flywheel was turning fine when i mated the engine and tranny together...
now i cant get the enigne to spin at all...
i am confues to where to go from here...
some one said needle in a hey stack...
i be dag gum if this needle isnt exspensive...

i dont see sparks now since i found what was touching...
the new starter doesnt whine either but i dont and havent left it on long
enough to just try to get it to crank and right back out real fast...

what else can it be..??
