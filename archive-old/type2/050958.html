&gt;Actually, POR15 says you can spray their paints.  You just have to thin it out with POR15 thinner, supposedly.  They say you can use up to 5% thinner, which to me sounds like it would still be pretty thick.  Has anybody done this??

I have friends that have done it, and it worked very well.  It is true that you do not have to paint over POR-15.  If you use the grey stuff, it will eventually develop a yellowish tint.  If I remember, the black stuff stays fairly black even when exposed to sunlight.  Haven't tried the white stuff.  I plan on painting the outside of my heater boxes with the black stuff next time I have them off.  Maybe all of my tin too.
