Subject: Re: [T2] mudflaps

From: &quot;Richard Atwell&quot; &lt;ratwell_at_mac_dot_com&gt;
&gt; I think he means www.gowesty_dot_com. Page 36 of their 2002 catalog had VW
dealer mudflaps but they haven't had them for a long time...

I thought that's what I'd heard.

&gt; ... website anymore. They are working on their own for 68-79 busses. They
may have the front ones available in a months time. The rears, I don't know.

Do you know if they're going to license the VW logo?

Front ones?  That makes sense, but I didn't know about those.  Any pics
somewhere, or are they not that much different from the back ones?  It might
be possible to design one set to fit both applications.
