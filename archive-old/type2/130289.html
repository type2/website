Subject: Re: [T2] What is on that wheel?

&gt;Who knows?, Only thing I can think of is attachment points for some 
&gt;sort of snowchains? All that rust came from somewhere...

&gt; So on the bus with the rotted fender, what are those bolts on the 
&gt;wheel (not the lugnuts) holding?

Ah HA!  I've got it - they're decoy lug bolts.  Put the hub cap in place and
any would-be theives spend hours spinning those giant bolts to no avail.
Gotta protect those expensive rims...

Or possibly the wheel is REALLY out of balance and that was the only way
they could correct it?

Or maybe a new form of wide-5 adapter to use later bus rims on an early bay.
