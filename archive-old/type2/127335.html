&gt; Is there any reason you couldn't powder coat the inside of a fuel tank?

Ooh, a question that basic physics knowledge can answer!

Powder coating works by charging the object electrostatically so that the
powder sticks to it until it is put in the oven.

The electric field inside any conductive shell is zero, so the powder
won't stick to the metal.
