No silicone will stand up to fuel and it should never be used on gaskets
that see fuel.

&gt;&gt; So in my gasket kit there are 2 of the thick plastic ones, and several of
&gt;&gt; the pressed aluminum ones. I have a carbed 1800, single carb, it had the
&gt;&gt; plastic ones in there.
&gt;&gt; Should I just use the aluminum ones?

OH ENOUGH ALREADY. Come on folks the single Weber she has on
the thing (I assume) has 2 metal &quot;intake&quot; gaskets per runner. What are
they BUG EXHAUST MANIFOLD GASKETS. And yeah they are likely
gooped up with silicone. They are likely thin stamped ridged aluminum.

OK you do not want to substitute FI gaskets (although they fit and are
a very nice gasket) as they are phenolic insulators, the entire point of
their existance actually. You could use thick paper gaskets that are
one per side (with 2 holes per gasket and look like a thin FI gasket)
but they too insulate. These are available for a couple bucks each
and come in some Weber kits and appear to be a nicer solutions
asthetically. What the PO did was in fact the best and cheapest
solution on a single Weber. They used metal bug gaskets that give a
nice heat transmission path up the runners to help with the Weber's
notorious bogging problems. As to all gooped up with silicone, well a
nice uniform coat of ultra-copper wouldn't hurt. &lt;snip&gt;
