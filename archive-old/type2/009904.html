Hi Dana -

Sounds like the needle bearings in the gland nut (big nut that holds on
the flywheel) are frozen.  I know it's a real PITA, but drop the engine
'one more time', and check the condition of those little needles.  It's a
 _real_  good idea to replace the nut during an overhaul; you might get
by with just greasing them.  Take a good look at the needles - any signs
of rust or pitting mean it's replacement time.  Also, while you have the
tranny separated, take some  sandpaper (320 grit) and polish the end of
the input shaft that sits in this bearing.  Applu a little grease, and
you're good to go!
