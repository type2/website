Subject: Re: [T2] wide tire myth

&lt;&lt; I will also put forth the fact that performance car manufacturers such as 
Porsche, Ferrari, Viper (Dodge) and Corvette (GM) equip their cars with wide 
tires.  As with our beloved VW engineers, these guys are not stupid.  They 
know they could save money by putting smaller, narrow tires on their cars.  
The fact that they don't do it speaks volumes for my position.

The fact that &quot;economy&quot; cars come with relatively narrow tires also makes 
sense, since narrow tires have less rolling resistance (as has been pointed 
out) and provide better... well, better economy.
 &gt;&gt;

Check the total wins column...A narrow-tyred type 35 Bugatti still holds the
record...Not 'zactly an economy car... ;-)
