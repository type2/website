Subject: RE: [T2] Poptop Canvas Instructions

&gt; Is the material in the pictures cotton duck, canvas, or is it
&gt; some sort of sail cloth material?
&gt; I can't make it out from looking at the pictures.


It's cotton duck.  I stock it in tan or yellow, and can order it in other
colors (takes about 5-7 days extra).  The yellow is somewhat bright, as the
pictures show.  The tan (really more of a &quot;mustard&quot; color if you ask me) is
much more subdued.  Sunbrella (marine material) is available for about $70
more.  However, as I have commented before, I'm not personally convinced
that it's worth the extra $$, in that its only real advantage (lack of
fading over time) is not much of an issue on a poptop (which isn't exposed
to strong sunlight every day as a boat would be), whereas its drawback
(stiffer; harder to tuck/fold) will be noticed every time you use it.
