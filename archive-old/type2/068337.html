Subject: Re: Aux. Battery inst. in '72??

Hi! Her Majesry is a 68 bus and she's running a second battery that is 
a deep discharge yaghting battery - and a battery combiner from West 
Marine. If you call them and ask for a catalog they will send you one - 
and there is a great piece in it that explains how to wire the battery 
combiner and the batteries - complete with schematic. I also bought one 
of their little bombproof battery trays so the new battery would be 
secure.

Hope this helps.
