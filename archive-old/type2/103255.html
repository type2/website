&lt;&lt; I can just see it,  some 15-20 years from now when the next owner of the 
'72 
is arguing on the type 2 list about the wrench size for the metal brake 
lines on their '72 being 12 mm, not 11 mm!!
Crazy world, filled with crazy people.

As the future PO of the 72 is it not  your duty to inform the new owner of 
such 
modifications? Of course when that person becomes the PO there's no telling 
if 
they will. :-)
