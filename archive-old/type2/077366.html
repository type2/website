Subject: Re: Fwd: Re: [T2] Battery cable, starter relay.

&gt; I found the perfect answer, it was a Bosch WR1 Low Voltage Relay Kit.
&gt; It cost less than fifteen Dollars. This reduces the amount of voltage required to run the starter to around 7 volts. It was easy to install and all my starting problems went away.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The way I understood it was that the starter always requires 12 volts and ALOT of current - regardless of which relay kit we use...
&gt;

The starter itself does require a hefty current at somewhat near the
correct voltage. The very large wire from the battery directly to the
starter solenoid carries this current.
The solenoid on the starter is a combination of a) a relay and b) an
actuater to engage the starter to the engine.
The problem is that this solenoid still requires a fair current and is not
extermely voltage tolerant. The current path for the solenoid is from the
battery, past the headlight switch, through the ignition switch and back
to the rear of the bus to the solenoid spade terminal.
Either dirty corroded conections or a hot starter solenoid needing more
current or most likely a bit of each creates the hot start or not start
problem.
The bosch relay requires much less energy to actuate so it is much less
prone to be affected by the long path back and forth.
The relay shortens the path to the solenoid the same way the solenoid
shortens the path to the starter.
So now you have a relay for a relay(solenoid) for the starter.
Simple but effective.
cheers.
