Hey Volks,

More of a sob story than anything else . But I do need a little advice. 
Last night I was on my way home from my first signifigant camp outing, two 
days of fly fishing and camping on the Green River near Pinedale Wyoming. 
Cruising at about 65 in Retro my 75 westy. All of the sudden Bambi decides 
that the grass is greener on the other side of highway 191. Before I knew 
it there was a huge thump and then the sound of my mountain bike which was 
racked on the spare tire grinding and skidding under my wheels. Aside from 
the bike being totaled a 700$ loss damage was not too bad. I lost a 
headlight and the forementioned spare tire. A big dent in the nose. There 
is now a slight  thump thump..thump thump that is more noticable at low 
speed. the alignment is fine and the breaks pull evenly but this noise is 
new.  One other thing that is wierd the EGR light came on right after the 
crash. Muir says this light comes on automatically every 15000 miles .. 
coincidence??  The spare tire studs for mounting have been completely 
ripped out, guess i'll have to fabricate something there.

oh well   it could have been alot worse. it could have been a moose

Safe bussin    look out for wild animals
