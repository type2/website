Subject: transmission problem: help?

I'll preface this by saying that I've had minor shifting problems with
Spike for as long as I've owned him.  Every once in a while he'd refuse to
go into second gear during downshifts from third.  When it first started
happening, all I had to do was shift back into third and then go into
second again.  It didn't happen very often, and I always assumed it was
just my bad shifting skills that caused the problem in the first place.
Recently, however, the problem has gotten much worse.  When I try to go
into second from any gear the lever kinda binds up and won't go into any
gear at all until I stop (in whatever traffic I happen to be stuck) and
mess with the lever a bit.  Sometimes I have to shift into reverse to get
things unstuck.  This doesn't seem to be the usual &quot;hop out of gear&quot;
problem -- once I get into the right gear it stays there.

I'm really hoping that this isn't going to turn into a terribly
complicated or expensive problem.  (Does someone want to make me feel
better and tell me that it's not going to require me to pull the
engine/transmission? :) ) If anyone has seen this one before I'd really
appreciate a few pointers.  Also, assuming I do need transmission work,
can anyone point me in the direction of a decent transmission shop in the
Rochester/Buffalo/Syracuse area?

Thanks in advance.
