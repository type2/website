make sure there are no leaks in the cooling system, don't forget the lower
&quot;horns&quot; on the fan housing, they must be capped.  _IF_ the cooling tin is
intact then it should have no effect on the cooling.  I have been running
without em for many years and have guages and detected no effect when I
removed them.  (I also remove the tin under the pushrod tubes BUT NOT The
deflectors above the pushrod tubes)

YMMV
