Subject: engine won't start

I sent a really long message the other day, didn't get any replies. I was
trying to be thorough. I guess I was TOO thorough.

Over the course of a week, my bus became harder and harder to start.
Finally it just wouldn't even try to start. The starter cranks the engine,
but it doesn't even try to fire. 71 transporter, 1600dp engine, brand new
34-pict3 carb, new points, 009 dizzy less than 2000 miles ago, brand new
coil. After replacing all the other stuff, I put on new plugs and wires,
it started once, idled smoothly for less than 5 minutes, and then died
again. Hasn't started since. We've chased the spark all the way throught
the points, there's gas getting into the cylinders, you can smell it on
the spark plugs after you try to start it. It has fire and fuel, we can't
figure out any reason why it won't go!
