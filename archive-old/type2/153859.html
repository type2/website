Subject: t2 clutch cable snap

Good idea to know how long your cable is.  In a pinch I fixed mine with a thin
gaged wire cable and cable bolts from a hardware store.  My bus is a 78 and I
think it is 128.24 mm.  I bought the cable longer than i needed and lopped the
ends around the attachment point and attached to the tranny with a toggle bolt
so I could adjust it.  THis was after waiting 2 days for the part to be
shipped out (stuck in ROck Springs WY)  they sent me a cable for a bug.  I
asked my ridding partner if she wanted for me to Jimmy rig it so we could get
to the next show, but I couldn't promise how far we could make it.  A bit more
than two hours later we were road bound.  Held all the way from rock springs
WY  to Winter Park Colorado.  Just would need to adjust the toggle bolt from
time to time to get it tight again.  When it did break it broke where the
cable was attacked up front.  Metal on metal-  the electrical tape I used for
padding wore out.  But I got to see WSP!!!!   Cable broke coming down the pass
and I coasted as far as I could.  State trooper picked me up and gave me ride
to Auto part story (said you must be coming from that &quot;rainbow thing&quot;.  Rigged
it again (got faster) and called a friend in Denver and hung their till I got
the right cable.   Wish I had a spare clevis pin with me.  Reminds me that I
still have a small bolt and lock wsher down there and need to order another.
keep forgetting.

ALSO  remember to lubricate the cable and tubbing WELL,  I think this is why
mine broke early!    White Lithium grease.

Wish I had a digital camera  I was pretty proud of my patch job esp after I
got to the show.  Incidentaly I did lose a job over it because I was already
on the road for a Month, but oh well.
