Subject: hesitation cracked hose-Brake Booster

I posted yesterday about my cracked hose.  the replies suggested that it is 
my brake booster and that I'd notice my brakes feeling different.  And the 
brakes have gotten about an 1nch more of play in the past 2 weeks.

but you all are scaring me cuz I've been driving that thing for who knows 
how long its been like that.  the list says it will overheat my engine/blow 
a piston.  I just did a trip to the gorge which was about an hour drive with 
that hose cracked. Now you have me thinking I might have injured my engine.  
In past experience I was well aware of when my engine overheated(tons of 
white smoke and a tow ;).  i'd assume this time i'd notice also??  It runs 
fine and sounds great.

Anyhow, hopfully nothing happened to the busses heart.  I guess i'll do a 
compression test also.

Is it bad to re-route the hose under the coil so that it will still reach 
the manifold when I cut the ripped part of the hose off??  If I try to run 
it above the coil it doesn't reach.....


Nothin left to do but smile, smile, smile!!
