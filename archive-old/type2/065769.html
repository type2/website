Subject: For Sale: Corvair Monza Spyder Turbo

For all you engine swappin' freaks out there, from the 
Amarillo Daily News, Sat. Oct. 12:

1964 Corvair Monza Spyder.  4 speed, turbo, needs complete 
restoration.  $1500 cash or trade. (806) 358-7556 or (806) 
358-6040

I think this one had four carbs, some kind of 
blower, hydraulic lifters, aluminum crankcase, oil filter, 
and put out a hell of a lot of horsepower.

Usual disclaimers apply.
