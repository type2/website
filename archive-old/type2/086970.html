Subject: Re: [T2] Oil pump question

&gt; Considering replacing the oil pump in my 75 2000cc. Oil pressure is just
&gt; not right and the pump is the only thing that wasn't replaced during the
&gt; rebuild. So I ask once again for advice before I proceed.
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Has anyone used any of the aftermarket oil pumps on the pancake
&gt; engine? Results good/bad? Longevity? Currently looking into CB
&gt; Performance but looking for suggestions.

when I rebuilt my 2L a few years ago I used a new Melling high capacity
pump and honed it in before installation.  this is a stock pump for the 2L

get great presure and volume

&gt; 2. Is it possible to change the pump without pulling the engine?
&gt; Eyeballing says if I remove the tin on the back of the engine I should
&gt; be able to remove the alternator, fan and housing to access the pump.

in theory yes, in practice PITA
