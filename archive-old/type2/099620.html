Subject: Re: [T2] Problems w/ Idle During Warmup

&gt;Maybe someone's experienced this and can offer some advice.  When I first
&gt;start the bus it runs fine -- idle is a little high and choke is activated.
&gt;Once the bus is fully warmed up it runs fine too -- idle at around 900rpm and
&gt;choke is open.  The problem is in between those two points.  Once I've driven
&gt;off down the road and for about the first 5 minutes (until the bus is fully
&gt;warmed up) the bus just won't idle unless I keep a foot on the gas.  Engine is
&gt;a 1600 DP, semi-stock (no flaps or tstat), timing is dead on and the carb is
&gt;tuned correctly (according to Hoover's field tuning a 34PICT sermon).  Also I
&gt;should mention that I've had this problem both with a 009 dizzy and the vac
&gt;dizzy I'm using right now.

The carb normally comes with a choke pull off that is activated by carb 
vacuum. Sounds like your's is stuck or torn.

This keeps the engine for starving for air or being drowned with gasoline.
