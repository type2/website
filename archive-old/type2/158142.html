&gt; I've often wondered if the &quot;open-source&quot; style of software 
&gt; development could be applied to the automobile industry. Since the 
&gt; major automotive manufacturers have already outsourced the 
&gt; manufacture of most of their components, would it be all that 
&gt; difficult to design a basic chassis capable of supporting a user-
&gt; defined selection of suspension, power-plants and interior components??
&gt;
   While not the final &quot;open source&quot; ...Lots of new cars are already built
on &quot;shared platforms&quot; ... Often between manufacturers...Another name
for this is &quot;badge engineering&quot;...Altho' that leads to things like the in-
famous Caddy Cimarron... ;-(
