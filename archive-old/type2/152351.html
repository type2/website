Subject: Re: one year only 6volt motor

I'm not sure about the one year only thing but perhaps that's right for 
some applications. The Type 3s used a 200mm flywheel as well. There were 2 
different 200mm flywheels used and the difference is in the way they mated 
to the crank. One flywheel uses an O ring and the other doesn't. So you 
need to look carefully at the end of the crank on your 2 motors to 
determine if they are the same. Or if you have the six volt flywheel from 
that motor compare those.

&gt; Subject: one year only 6volt motor
&gt;
&gt; I remember someone telling me that there was a one year only 6v motor/flywheel
&gt; combo. How do I tell if I have that combo? The reason I ask is the motor I
&gt; have in my 70 camper's head is striped  and I have tried fixing it by drilling
&gt; it and tapping it from the already oversized 10mm to 7/16 but that lasted a
&gt; day, grrr. So what I want to do is take a 6V motor I have and put it in my
&gt; camper till I get a new head put on.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks Ian
