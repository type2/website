Hi Isaiah,

It sounds like you've done a good bit of AC work. 
There's supposed to be a drop in replacement for R12
which is called FR12 (FrigC) and made by Intercool. 
Their web site is &lt;www.igc_dot_com/intercool&gt;.  Do you
think this stuff will work as a replacement for R12? 
Permanent conversion from R12 involves adding 2 oz of
ester oil, and charging with the FR12 blend in liquid
mode.  One of the components of the blend is R134A.

I wouldn't mind having the compressor if it is a York
R209R (marked on a metal plate), with 4.5 inch pulley.
 Would you be willing to ship it to Virginia, if I pay
the freight?  

Rob
