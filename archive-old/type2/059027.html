Yo's,

Someone doth spoke:
&gt;With all the supporters of fuel injection out there, how come no one has a
fuel injected 1600 in their bus?  

I once put a 1776 type 3 in a 1963 1/4 window bus.  I did not use the fuel
injection, but had baby dellorto's.  Ducting the cooling intake was the
biggest problem, the air comes in from the back and I cut out the back of
the engine lid to accommodate some cheesy aluminum ductwork and large
diameter hoses that I stuck up the sides to catch some fresh air from the
elephant ears.  The sides of the engine compartment also had to be diced
up.  What a scene.

This was the engine that I cooked due to lean mixture.  I don't believe the
air intake was doing any significant harm or good over the stock rig.  I
thought it would be nice to have the fan on the flywheel to harmonically
balance the flywheel and not tax the generator bearings with high speed fan
weight.  I think I'd had some genny failures around that time and I was
sick of them.

The stock 1600cc FI is pretty good, I even have a mostly complete 1971 type
3 kit lying around should some lost soul want to try it.  Couldn't sell it
at a swap meet for $50 so I kept it.  I was running it on the squareback
1776 with some success, it passed smog with flying colors, (lean!) it had a
289 cam, extractor exhaust and a couple strategically placed resistors.  I
should have kept it on, given what a disaster the under jetted baby dell's
were.  It got blamed for problems that clearly lay elsewhere.

Some things to consider would be;
The intake port runners and throttle housing sit right where the upright
fan housing is, you'd have to fashion other, longer, less responsive
runners and place the throttle 'somewhere'.
The engine should have the stock cam, and the FI stepped heads with stock
compression.
The fuel ring return has to be rigged, as someone mentioned it's not too
hard, just pesky.
About two dozen other things that you may as well not bother with, the 32
PSI fuel pump and relay, vacuum fittings for your brakes, the nefarious FI
distributor, etc.

If you're frustrated with the 34 PICT-3, wait till you try beating a type 3
FI into a bus.  The 75 beetle rig sounds like it might be the most suitable
and probably the least expensive if you get your parts used.

I continue to recommend the Weber 34 ICT dual kit with updated jetting.
The progressive is likely very good and maybe easier to work on and more
reliable once you verify it's correct jetting and that it won't ice up.

Search the Vanagon 1994-1996 archives under &quot;Haltech&quot; and you can read all
about my exploits with the 78x90.5 PEFI engine.
