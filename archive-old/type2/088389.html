Subject: Re: [T2] diamonds are forever

Hi Michael,

I have looked on the &quot;Volkswagens in Film and Video&quot; site and saw the pic of
the airport bay bus. http://vwfilms_dot_net/daf.htm
But is a bit too blurry to tell if the tail lights are horizontal.
It might have been a special conversion for the airport at that time.

As a Dutchman i can tell you it must have been a custom job. I have never
seen horizontal tail lights on baywindow buses on the road.

&gt;
&gt; I was watching this James Bond flick last night....and noticed 3 bays and
2 splits...but I saw something wierd.  The part of the movie where I saw 2
of the bays was set in Amsterdam and the tail lights were horizontal.  I had
never seen this before so i had to rewind it a couple times...we this done
in certain areas? or was this just something that could have been issued
only for utitlity vehicles as these were being used on a runway as transport
cars...
&gt;
&gt; thanks
