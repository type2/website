&gt;* the muffler is weak, old, rusty. the tailpipe fell off and i got a new one
&gt;welded on, but not a new muffler.

I would assume by the time I got back the muffler would be a problem 
so I would replace it before the trip. Rule out a problem.

&gt;* there are major oil leak/burn problems. it is in the shop today to
&gt;determine the level of these problems and what needs done.

Perhaps just replace the valve cover gaskets and pushrod tube seals.

&gt;* the engine isn't compressing fully in all cylinders. (80-120-120-120).

First, reset the valves. Try just 1/4 turn in from contact and see 
how the compression tests then. I would not head out on a road trip 
with the weak cylinder. Just asking for problems in a snow storm over 
a pass. Not the place to address a failure.

&gt;* tires. maybe i need new tires to be able to get over the mountains and
&gt;almost definite snow?

Yes, put on good snow tires and have chains for sure.


&gt;beyond the known things, any other suggestions/worries?

Flush the brake fluid and exercise the calipers, then inspect for 
leaks behind the caliper boots. If the fluid is nasty, 
rebuild/replace the cylinders and calipers. Other maintenance. 
Replace the trans fluid. Verify steering gear adjustment and steering 
links/ball joints. Check all lights. Wipers. Play in front and rear 
wheel bearings. Replace all old fuses with new ceramic bodied spec type.

I would verify all maintenance given in the Bentley before any long 
range travel. Lots cheaper to fix now than to fail when out of town.
