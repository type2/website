Have now found a company in London who re-build the 34PDSITs.  Will let =
you know the outcome.

Have been reading the corresponence about 009 distributers.  I have one =
on my 2litre Type 4.

- Will it really damage my engine?

- Is there a UK source for stock vac dizzies.  Which is best? Don't even =
suggest electronic - very expensive here - I got quotes for =
replacing/repairing my old one.

Thanks,

Dave
