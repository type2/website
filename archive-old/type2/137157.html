Subject: Re: Windsheild sources?

Hi Brian,

My local glass shop was able to find a new one fairly easily from his standard supplier. The price was not bad but I don't recall what it was. I do seem to recall something about him not being able to find the seal but these are easily available from the vintage VW parts suppliers that contribute to this list.

Good luck,
Bill Moon
'71 VW Type 2
'72 Saab 96

My '71's windsheild is beginning to permenantly fog around the edges.  I 
guess its time replace it.  Any know where it can get a replacement?
