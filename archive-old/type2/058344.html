Subject: RE: Pulling fan on '78 Westy
Content-Disposition: inline

Rest assured, Gordan, it WILL come off. I've just a few days ago done the same thing,
I had to lever it, pull it, force it, swear at it etc. but it eventually comes off.
Don't be afraid of using a little 'applied leverage'. There is a close fitting 'seal'
between pulley/fan and fan housing, so don't force it to extreme angles, though.

PS Never ask why

&gt;&gt;&gt;    I'm still working on rebuilding my 2.0L for my '78 Westy, removed
the three bolts near the center of the fan (I'm not even working on
getting the fan HUB off yet), and try as I might, even though all the
books say it comes right off, the dang thing won't budge. Any ideas on
1) why it's stuck contrary to popular opinion and 2) how to remove it?
