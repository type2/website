Subject: Re: [T2] Clickety-Click CV Joint

&gt; What are good ways to verify that one's CV joint is on its way out?
&gt;
&gt; A couple of weeks ago I began to get a squeak. I couldn't tell if it was
&gt; my driver's side front or rear wheel. Now when rolling to a stop I can
&gt; hear the faint clickety-click of what I think is a CV joint on its way
&gt; out. I think the squeak and click are the same thing, where it squeaks
&gt; when rolling at faster speeds and turns clicks when rolling to a stop.

first
before you start to mess with the cv joints.
check the torque of the rear 46mm axle nuts.

if you do decide it is the cvs, and this is the first youve noticed it,
you can probably just regrease them. You can regrease them in place if you
are creative or pull the half shafts, clean, inspect, grease and
reinstall.

bus cvs are amazingly long lived.
