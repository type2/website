I enjoyed my short stay in Sevierville, TN last weekend and enjoyed meeting 
several listmembers there.

A caravan of two buses, me and Ronnie Hunter in my '68 crewcab and Allen 
Becker in his '67 Westy, left Marietta, Ga about 3:00pm on Friday.  We had 
a fairly uneventful trip up until we got into Tennessee.  Somewhere before 
Madisonville we came up on a '79 Westy and a T3 Fastback pulled off the 
road with a guy's head stuck in the engine compartment.

We pulled over to see if we could help and learned it had started to hiccup 
so he pulled over.  We quickly diagnosed that his #3 plug wire was not making 
a good connection to it's plug.  Allen had a good spare plug wire so we put 
that on it &amp; cranked it up.  It was idling rough and sounded like one lifter 
was not pumping up right.  We asked when he had checked the points &amp; timing 
last &amp; he said over a year ago.  We replaced the points with a set I had in 
my spare distributor &amp; set the timing, but it still ran a little rough.

We decided to drive on a couple of miles to see if the lifter would pump up.  
He said after about a mile it was back to normal and we went on to grab a 
bite to eat at an A&amp;W Root Beer Drive-In.  We then got out &amp; he introduced 
himself as Travis Barefoot (Native-American name I am guessing).  I almost 
introduced myself as Dave Hammertoes, but I didn't know what kind of sense 
of humor Travis had (some people have hinted that mine borders on being 
strange).  He was a really nice guy &amp; had a pretty wife, but I can't remember 
her name to save my life.  They were from Chattanooga.  We caravanned the 
rest of the way to Sevierville together.

The first people I saw upon entering the fairground that I recognized 
descended upon me before I could get parked.  First Charlie Ford (from 
points unknown), then Bo &amp; Tonya Drake (from Birmingham), then Ed Harris 
(from Huntsville).  They invited me to set up by them, but before doing so 
I asked if they were going to be drunk and yelling all night.  They assured 
me they weren't, but I forgot to ask Ed about his stereo...  ;)

Between 11-midnite we went around the campfire.  Ted Finesman showed up 
with a fifth of &quot;special&quot; whiskey which was being passed around the 
campfire.  I only took one swig from the first round, but I am an amatuer 
drinker (I gave up my professional drinking status my junior year of 
college when I realised I had to graduate...).  It was a bit potent!  Thanks 
to Tony for sending it down.

It started raining and I went back to my tent and went to sleep.  It rained 
a good bit of the night, but I slept well.  I woke up to Charlie's dog Gus' 
breath the next morning when Ronnie unzipped the door of the tent and Gus 
decided to take refuge from the rain.  

It rained most of the morning while I was digging through the swap area.  I 
was a bit disappointed in the amount of pure JUNK some people brought out.  
I ended up spending $2 - $1 for a NOS '68-71 tailpipe and $1 for a used 
12v 9-pin flasher.  I usually spend over $100 at this show. 

After lunch I met Blake Sartin, who is really nice guy who has had some bad 
luck with his first engine rebuild.  Hopefully I will be able to help him 
get it sorted out so he can enjoy his bus this summer.

I also met Lucas in the green &amp; white split with air-scoops, fender flares, 
smoothed dash, cut front seat bulkhead &amp; HUGE front seats.  Early '70s 
&quot;customization&quot;...  Nice guy with pretty wife.  He brought some Westy 
interior parts for me to take back to David Martin's roommate James (James 
send him his money!).

I saw Steve Lashley's bus (nice bus!) and new tent (nice tent!), but never 
found him to talk to him.  I did see Ric Jablonski and his bus (or his Dad's 
bus) which was interesting.  It had a &quot;blindspot&quot; cabinet &amp; bed like a SO-67 
but also had a jumpseat &amp; tall cabinet behind the driver seat like Dormobiles 
have.  It also had the small poptop.

I also met David Sheridan, but I don't know if he is on the list or not.  
I know he posts on usenet from time to time.

I had to leave about 4:00pm on Saturday so I missed anyone else who was 
there.  The only problem I had going back was a gas hose coming loose on my 
driver side carb.  This week I am pulling the engine to re-torque the heads 
so I am going to re-do the gas lines and synch the carbs again (they have 
started popping on decelleration).

Anyway, it was good meeting those of you I had not met before and it was 
good seeing those of you I had met before again!  Hopefully we will have 
better weather this weekend in Huntsville, AL.

Dave
