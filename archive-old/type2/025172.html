X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

&lt;&lt;The bus is running beautifully, but I am having a problem with white
exhaust
smoke. The smoke appears when I start the bus and the engine is already
warm. Stop at the store, go in, get a couple of things, come back out and
fire her up. Poof, big cloud of white smoke. It doesn't happen when the
motor is cold.&gt;&gt;

Sounds to me like you have fuel leaking from one or both of the New carbs
you just bought.  Check the fuel pump for too high pressure, and the
needle/seat assemblies on the carbs(assuming they have them).
