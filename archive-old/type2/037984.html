&gt; can anyone give me some info on installing an aftermarket

&gt; that's just too slow.  Any ideas on the easiest way to get
&gt; that opening the size I want it without tearing up that nice
&gt; original dash?

I recently installed a new radio/CD player in my '79 Westy.  In my case,
the new unit was a bit too tall but just about the right width.  What I
did first was to remove the existing aftermarket radio and the glovebox.
Then I used a pistol-grip type saw with a metal-cutting blade to cut
down about 8-10 mm into the bottom edge on the left and right sides, and
up the same amount in the top edge.  I then used a pair of vice-grips to
bend down the edges - my arm was through the glovebox openning and I
clamped on the grips from inside the dash, then bent the already turned
edges further into the dash.  By working carefully I was able to get the
openning so it just fit my new radio, and with the radio's back bracket
attached to one of the e-brake brackets it's pretty solid.  Damage to
the dash was minimal too - I could have put back the old radio and the
new cuts would be hidden by the faceplate.

Enlarging both dimensions will proabably be a little trickier, but
should be doable.

Good luck!
