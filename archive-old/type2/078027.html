Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Heat

List, Jim:
I'm convinced that the safest heat while camping would be an electric heater, if
you can get an electric campsite. I'd think even a 1500watt electric heater
would keep a small area pretty toasty and add NO moisture or fumes to the mix we
breath. A BIT safer than combustion heaters loose inside the camper, but still
have to look out for igniting stuff nearby!
Maybe one day soon I'll duct tape the rust holes shut in my westy and go campin!

&gt; I do recommend you have a fire extinguisher handy and don't do this if
&gt; you've ever smelled gas fumes inside of your bus. Make sure all of your fuel
&gt; lines are quite secure (always a good idea!).
