Huh?

&gt;I say it again.
&gt;The Deutscshes Methode will set you free, reduce your cost per
&gt;mile, protect you from perils, and improve your life.

I would take issue with the cost per mile.  For instance, I have run the
same rotor for 65,000 miles now.  No need to change it because it continues
to work just dandy.  Replacing parts when they are not broken (or ready to
break) leads to many good parts going into the dumpster.  That is bad for
the environment, and bad for your checkbook.  Clutches are a good example
of this - &quot;oh, replace your clutch while you have the engine out, just in
case!&quot; usually results in throwing $150 in good parts in the dumpster.  I
change my oil every 3k (synthetic) and replace things when they break, and
I guarantee you my cost per mile is less than someone who replaces their
entire ignition system at every other oil change.

Don't get me wrong - I appreciate the message you're trying to get across,
but realize that this list is composed of close to 1,000 people, many of
which cannot or don't desire to spend the time and/or money required to
replace parts at the rate you recommend.  I'm not ashamed to admit that I
carry spare plugs, points, cap, rotor, condensor, valve cover gaskets, and
spark plug wires and I generally do not replace any of the above until they
break.  I do inspect and adjust them regularly however.  I believe this to
be the most cost-effective method of keeping my bus on the road, and it
frees up some spare time too.

&gt;&gt;so.. Carry those spares and those tools.  Just dont put off that regular
&gt;&gt;maintenance and inspection.
&gt;
&gt;No argument. Until the DM is studied and practiced for many years and
&gt;become rote habit, they are needed for reassurance and stop gap to
&gt;bridge the learning process.

They are needed after that, too, if you're journying out of town some
distance.  :)
