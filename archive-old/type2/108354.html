Subject: A Dixie Bus Thank You

Woooooooohooooooooooo.......

I have received allot of kind notes of appreciation, and thought I should post
the real thank you's.  Dixie Bus could have been a hand full, and did actually
start that way, but with the generosities of a few hundred, we pulled together
one hell of a gathering.
Not in any order, I appreciate the help and support of FMBC.  We were supplied
with some stickers to sell to help defray the costs.  Thank you to TheSamba.
Everett donated a couple of shirts for the drawing.  To my set up crew, thank
you to Six Pack, Dwayne Deckhard.  Could not have done it with out you.  To my
firewood splitting crew, Dwayne, Brian, Stan, Greg, awesome job.  John Baker
for running after my beers and smokes while the chili was being stirred.  To
my veggie cutting team, Dwayne, Terry, Tom and others.  To my stirring team,
Terry, Tom and Chuck and Mike.  Thank you to Man Made Moon for entertaining
the masses.
A special tanks to all my out of town guest, who felt it worth a 10+ hour
drive.  Mark Dearing and Wild Bill from Salem Virginia.  Thanks soooooo much
for the great gifts.  felt like Christmas.  To Jason Laster, thanx for putting
us on the radar screen.  Another moonie from South Carolina, Tom.  Fro
Delaware, Dave and Christy Parsons, cool to have you in the buckeye state.  We
had some guests from Florida,Mel Vickie and Dave. came to Ohio for the
Dead/Dylan show and made their way to Dixie Bus.  My great friends from
Syracuse, Brian and Liz, and daddy Tim, glad you had a great time.  Joe and
Erin from Pittsburgh, glad you made it, Joe thanx for the beverages!  A huge
THANK YOU    to our new Canadian friend, Stan, a wonderful donation of a
barrel of adult libations!  We would have been a bust had it not been for the
hours donated by Mamabus and 2buk....thanx for selling all those
tickets!!!!!!!  Troy from Pennsylvania dropped by after the COVVC show, as did
Keith Price from LEAKOIL in Detroit.  My awesome friend Teddy Bear once again
provided desert!!!! Yay!
If I have forgot to mention your wonderful help, kindly drop me a reminder and
I will print it.
I want to say in closing thank you to a wonderful group of people.  I received
good feedback from Rustic Knolls, we were a very quite group.  Without your
support in getting event shirts, stickers and what not, we would have had a
tough time.
See you all next year.
