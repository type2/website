Subject: [T2] 78 Ball joints

Hello Frank,

    I have never used an OTC ball joint tool by name, but I have used an
aftermarket &quot;C&quot; clamp tool. I found the guide tools didn't have the relief's
for the control arm in them. So when you try to press the new joint in it
tries to start at an angle. Another thing the size's were off just enough to
make things difficult like getting the old ones out. I think if you were to
&quot;grind&quot; a relief in the lip of the closest size tool it would work much
better.
    Are you close to Lake Charles, Louisiana? I have the factory tools and
would be glad to press them for you at N/C. Give me a call.
