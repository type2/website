Hi Jamie,

You are SO right about that... Like when we installed the 411 engine  
into my bus in your driveway, only to find that it didn't have a  
pilot bearing.

Since it came from an automatic car, it never needed a pilot bearing.  
I certainly never thought to look for it. You gotta watch for  
everything...

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
