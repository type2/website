Subject: Sump Oil Temp Sender

Hi,

We installed a sump oil temp sender and gauge and it reads no higher than
180 on the highway. We read that these senders tend to run on the low side
which makes sense because the engine seems to get up to normal temperature
(feeling the dipstick). Any comments on this?

Thanks,
Jen
