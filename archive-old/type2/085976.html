Subject: Re: [T2] Windshield wiper woes...

Rick,

If you can't get the nut off the shaft (maybe try a pair of needlenose 
pliers?), you'll have to take a hacksaw to the shaft. Then you'll have to 
pull the entire assembly so you can install a new shaft (very cheap part to 
replace). Take a look at the Bentley diagram or look up the wiper assembly 
on Busted Bus to see what all parts you'll need to replace after cutting the 
old one off.

Of course, if the wiper arm is in the desired position (and the nut is tight 
enough), you could probably live with it like that for a while.

Good luck!

Sean Fulkerson,
