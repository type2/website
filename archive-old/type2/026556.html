Subject: RE: Rear Brake Adjustment SNAFU

&gt;I managed to actually BREAK off the end of my large &quot;heavy-duty&quot; 
&gt;Craftsman screwdriver while trying to turn one of the stubborn 
&gt;adjustment stars --  and the last half-inch or so of the driver blade
&gt;fell inside the brake drum through the adjustment hole, and remains 
&gt;there. Typical gotcha, for me.  I don't know how far down inside it

As you've already heard, you really need get the piece out of there.  At
best, it'll damage the drum and I suppose it could actually interfere with
the operation of the brake.  

Pulling drums off of a 79 shouldn't be too bad.  Just remove the wheel/tire
and then remove the 2 (11mm?) bolts from the surface of the drum.  After
you've got the drum off (it may require a little coaxing and if possible,
you may want to back the adjusters a bit), pull the adjuster stars out of
their bores and clean them up real nice and smear a little grease on them
before putting them back in (don't leave any excess grease though).  

Good luck.
