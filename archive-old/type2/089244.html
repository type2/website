&gt; Hey everyone- came out of work Saturday morning and my 78 bus started
&gt; right up but then died.  Started it up again and the same thing
&gt; happened.  It is cranking fine, it just won't keep running unless I keep
&gt; my foot on the gas revving it, and it backfired a few times.  When I
&gt; turn the key to the accessories position I can not hear the fuel pump
&gt; running.  Does this mean bad fuel pump?  I am getting it towed Monday-
&gt; help!  Thanks, Beth and Prudence the 78 Bus.

Dear Prudence ( just *had* to say that ! ) and Beth-
You might also check the plug on the AFM.
Either loose plug or defective pin connections.
Disconnect the AFM from the air filter box
and gently push a long screwdriver into it
from the air filter side to open the flapper,
the fuel pump will run. If it is sticking, there
is a warped flapper due to the backfiring.
