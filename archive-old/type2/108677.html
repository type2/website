Subject: Engine Break-in

Just did the first oil-change/tune-up on my new avp rebuld (100 miles). They
said I could use normal oil, so I used Castrol 20w50. I did notice
(afterwards) that there was a post in the archives about Castrol being bad
for break-in...that doesn't make much sense to me, but if anyone has any
comments I'd like to know.

Oil had a few fine metallic hairs, and a very few fine brass(?) flakes. I
guess that's about par.

All the valves were .001&quot; or .002&quot; tighter than when I started. Is that
normal? They were at .006&quot; initially.

I also couldn't get the RPM below about 1100-1200.  This has been a
perpetual problem for my bus; prior to the rebuild too. Would this
invalidate my timing or cause other problems? It's weird; sometimes the
rpm's get down to the 900's when the engine is really warm, but not always.
I have my suspicions about that aux air valve (but I've tested mine and
tried another one).

Total advance was around 32 BTDC.
