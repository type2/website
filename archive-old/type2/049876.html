Subject: Re: [T2] FLAPS?

&gt;I checked the Library and the Archive and can't find a definition for
&gt;&quot;FLAPS.&quot;  Is this a vendor name or a disparaging acronym like &quot;f#$% lame
&gt;auto parts store?&quot;  Thanks for continuing my education,
&gt;
&gt;j a clary

No, thank you, j a, for a new definition which fits some FLAPS. Others can
point you to the page with ALL the acronyms used here. FLAPS is commonly
used on this list for Friendly Local Auto Parts Store.

I'm sure it took me several weeks to confirm what FLAPS was when I first
saw it. I wasn't smart enought to just ask and show MY ignorance.
