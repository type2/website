Hi volks,

&gt; Need to replace my rear shoes on my '70 westy.  I can't find a 46 mm

 Metric IS standard. How much more standard can you get?

 ..and this from a maths teacher. Words fail me.

  If the FLAPS in your area don't carry (or can't get) unusual metric sizes
then I'm sure that the mail-order places can get one to you in no time.
 I know that Just Kampers in the UK carry these, but I'd be very surprised
if they are not available from tool stockists in the US.

Cheers,
	 W.
