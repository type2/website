Todd:

I came across a crossover pipe for my '78 at a flea market a couple of
years ago.  Had to drill out the original studs to render it useable
again, but it seems that these things are only available used.  So I've
always got an eye out for these pipes.

Does your '76 require the intake air preheating tube on the crossover
pipe?  This was standard on chassis numbers before 226 2077 584 per
Bentley.

I don't know anything about the GT Sport System but - comments on
painting:

I recently re-did most of my exhaust system.  The afterburner pipes,
heat exchanger ends, Y-pipe, connector pipe, muffler and tailpipe I
painted with black barbeque paint (after glass beading the factory paint
off the new muffler and connector pipe and the corrosion off the old
pieces).  On the crossover pipe, however, I used a silver high
temperature exhaust paint.  Don't remember the brand.  But within only
about 30 minutes of running, the silvery high temperature paint was
blistering and peeling off the crossover pipe like a very fine tin
foil.  On the other hand, the barbeque paint has simply gone from its
original satin black to a flat back color.
