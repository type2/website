Subject: Update on Hillbilly Cruise Control

You guys are great!  Thanks to one and all who sent advice about my sticking
accelerator/throttle.  My hillbilly cruise control is gone.

I was dubious about the advice to vacuum and oil the accelerator pedal hinge,
but I started there because it sounded simplest.  This solved about 80% of the
problem!  I have been wearning muddy and sandy shoes a lot in the bus, so I
need to keep an eye on the health of the pedal mechanism.

To solve the other 20% of the problem, I squirted a few quarts of WD40 on the
whole throttle mechanism back in the engine compartment, also loosened the
accelerator cable clamp, pulled it taut, and retightened the clamp.

Now it is running just great, and I have now removed the &quot;extra&quot; spring that
was pulling the accerator cable back to the closed position.

I am a happy camper again and so is my camper.  Thanks again for all your
help!
