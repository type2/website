&lt;&lt; I have just installed the heavy duty 7/8&quot; Anti-Sway Bar on the front of my 
77 Bus and it's says to use the original clamps off the old sway bay. I have 
tried this and it doesn't seem like the clamps will ever fit, i have tried to 
get it to fit but to no avail. Has anyone else managed to pull this off? or 
do i need to get some bigger clamps, and if so where? &gt;&gt;

After some investigation i found the problem. I ordered the correct part and 
the correct part + price was on the invoice, however i was sent the wrong 
part. The clamp sent was for an early bus, not my late bus. I sure this would 
explain why it doesn't fit.
    Thanks anyway.
