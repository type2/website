I seem to recall that just this week someone here on our list received a
canvas from Dawn, and he was so happy with the product that he was
willing to forgive the delay. So, instead of kicking Dawn when she's
down, why not support her on her way back up? It seems she's getting it
back together.

We've all been there. And if we haven't yet, we will someday. Karma, man.

Besides, It appears from Clara's e-mail (once you sort through all the
vitriol) that her problem is with Dawn's (EX)HUSBAND. So why drag Dawn's
name through the mud on five VW mailing lists, including VW_Bug? That's,
like, the entire Internet VW community. That's ugly, man.

I think Dawn's owed an apology.

&gt; &lt;&lt; Please don't let's get into another round of Dawn-bashing. She had some
&gt;  troubles, she's doing her best to deal with it and keep her business

&gt; 
&gt;     Au contraire, as one who needs canvas, I wanna know if I spend my money
&gt; can I expect product in return. I've seen her product and think its of good
&gt; quality, 'But', if your business runs into problems for whatever reason, it
&gt; is inherent on you to tell the people who's money you've taken, 'sorry' it
&gt; will be another X months or more. To continue to take money when you can't
&gt; deliver product is nothing more than a Ponzi scheme.
