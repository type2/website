Subject: FI Starting Problems 

&gt;I was recently contemplating this same problem, and I was thinking
&gt;about the fuel pump and/or fuel pressure regulator.  The main fuel
&gt;ring is supposed to stay pressurized while the car is off, right?
&gt;But presumably it would leak down over time (how long?  hours?  a
&gt;week?  a month?).  If the pump or pressure regulator is getting
&gt;weak, could that be a cause of long-cranking starts, i.e., takes
&gt;the fuel ring a while to get up to pressure?

You could try the cold start valve again by supplying 12 to it when the
van has been off for a while, and see if it sqirts? Note make last connection
away from cold start valve to avoid spark igniting fuel! 

Could you also try turning the ignition to the on position for about 5 seconds
 before starting? My understanding of the system which could be wrong is that
the fuel pump starts when the ignition is turned on, and runs 10 seconds
before the double relay shuts it off unless the brain detects distributor
pulses? Is this correct?
