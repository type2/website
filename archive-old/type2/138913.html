Yes.

Yes.

&gt; My only other question is about the lower left hand corner.
&gt; Is Rons seal spliced there and then rejoined to form a 90 degree angle also
&gt; like the original?

The corner piece is specially molded and glued to the seal about 10 cm from
the corner in each direction.

&gt; Just want to make 100% sure as that is where I am having the most problems
&gt; with the OE seal.

Ron's Genuine VW German seal for $59 is the best available. I know what it
feels like to buy seals and get burned by the quality and fit. All I can say
for sure is that at my time of purchase Ron's seal was as advertized.
