&gt;Thanks for sharing all the FI diagnostics with the Type II list.  I will
&gt;save your message for reference.  The symptoms you were trying to
&gt;respond to are very similar to those I have seen with my 78 Westy.  Idle
&gt;is bad until the engine is very hot.
&gt;
&gt;Is there an idle air adjustment to make at the air flow sensor?  I
&gt;assume the sensor is what you are referring to as the AFM.

Yes but you need someway of metering richness, i.e., exhaust gas C O meter
or you could use an O 2 sensor.    Idle is set by both the screw on the
throttle body and the Bypass screw on the AFM (air flow meter).  (I have
info on adding an o 2 sensor to your exhaust manifold if you are
interested).


&gt;I have checked my cold start valve, but I have not checked the timer
&gt;operation. I am assuming that this is not the problem because the valve
&gt;is only supposed to be on for a few minutes and my problems lasts all
&gt;day if the weather is cool or driving with light loads.

The thermo time switch could be the problem as it might not shut off the
cold start valve, thus giving you a rich mixture.  This rich mixture would
give you the symptoms you are having on cold days and light loads, i.e.,
sluggish performance.
To check and see if it is the thermo time switch just disconnect the plug
on the cold start valve after the bus has warmed up.  The problem will go
away if its the thermo time switch.

&gt;I recall vaguely hearing about the wiper/reostat mechanism of the air
&gt;flow sensor as a potential problem.   Would you comment on that as well?

Yea.  the material that the sweep arm contacts eventually wears away.
Usually it makes you cut out at different loads.  I've read that it is
possible to move the contact plate up or down to find fresh material, but
I've never done it.  There have been recent posts on the proceedure.

Have fun
