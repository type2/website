About describes most retail establishments these days. A result of the 
great American race to the &quot;bottom&quot; price aka Wal-Mart is my argument. 
Went to Sears on Friday to buy snap-ring pliers to remove the drive 
flanges on my Cabrio daily driver so I could replace those leaky seals. 
Guy didn't know which shelf they were on and after 3 mins or so of 
looking, he literally left me to go help another customer - leaving me 
to look by myself. I usually don't ask for help b/c I know what I need 
and where to find it but this time got my goat... Our RS here is okay 
but their personnel know little or nothing about what they are selling 
unfortunately. I have switched to a few commercial suppliers we have 
here for electrical and electronics supplies but they have daytime hours 
only... Ugh! Anything but Wal-mart though... &lt;griN!&gt;

On the flip-side I needed two drive flange seals for my Cabrio. $18.50 I 
was quoted per side at NAPA plus postage (saw $8.50 on the NAPA computer 
screen, qty just 1, parts are 90 miles away near Nashville, the part 
would fit in a smaller yellow envelope and weighs maybe 3 ounces). I was 
shocked. Got them from an online supplier for $1.29 each with free 
shipping b/c I also bought some other maintenance items for the same '97 
VW Cabrio putting the total over $50...

Geez... I prefer to shop with our key suppliers or locally but that is 
the 2nd time NAPA was WAY, way out of the ballfield on price. They DO 
know some stuff though...
