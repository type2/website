Subject: Tranny woes, continued

Yesterday I picked up the '75 transmission, and with the hour of daylight I
had left after work, removed the CV joints from the old tranny and wrapped
them.  A couple of the bolts were really tight, but with both the vise grip
clamped on the outside and the new allen wrench on the inside, the bolts
couldn't resist.  I highly recommend using the vise grips to avoid
stripping the bolt heads.  The allen wrench you need is a 6mm - the longer
the better.  Push hard on the vise grips until they are about ready to
slip, then begin applying torque to the allen wrench.  Most of the time I
didn't even have to use it.

Today I dropped the engine and tranny.  It was just as easy as the book
said it would be, except that it looks like it will be a lot harder to
reinstall.  The hardest part was getting the floor jack with the engine and
tranny on it over the 1&quot; curb going into my garage.  Once inside the garage
I split the engine and tranny.

With the old and new transmissions side by side, I noticed some
differences.  The case on the '75 has more reinforcements (webbing) than
the '73, both on the top and the sides.  The length of the two trannies is
identical, and so is the input shaft length and diameter.  This tranny
looks like it should just bolt right in.  My old tranny was harder to turn
the drive shafts, but I don't know what the fluid is like in the new tranny
yet - never made it that far.

THEN I noticed that where there should have been two studs on the new
transmission there were none.  These are the two studs that hold the
bracket that holds the clutch cable so that when you step on the clutch,
the cable doesn't move and the clutch does.  Looking closer I notice that
the top hole where a stud should be half of the boss is cracked off, and
the remaining threads inside look really bad.  The lower hole, although not
cracked, is reamed way oversized and has just a couple remnants of threads
left in it.  DOH!!!!

This really throws a monkey wrench in my plans.  Tomorrow I will attempt to
take the transmission back and get back my $200 ($125 + $75 core).  I am
also going to take my old tranny into a friendly shop near work which I
visited two days ago.  They offered to diagnose my old tranny for free, and
not give it back to me in a box like Aamco did once upon a time.  At this
point there are only seven days left till my trip to the West Coast, and
five of those are work days.  I will either find another used transmission,
have my old one fixed, or (ugh!) look at buying a rebuilt one.  Or, I might
put the old tranny back in for the trip, and hit some junkyards along the
way back.  It's gone 40,000 miles with that bad bearing, I bet it can do
another 3,000.

So does anyone know if  '79 bus tranny will bolt into my '73 bus??  I heard
something about 76 - up trannies being a little longer than the old ones,
or something.  Any truth to this?

Thanks for all of the suggestions and encouragement so far - I appreciate it.
