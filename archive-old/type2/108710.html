&quot; it is only appropriate to try to keep unsafe vehicles off
the road and provide incentives for owners to keep their vehicles in shape.&quot;

Self-preservation is the only &quot;incentive&quot; I need to keep my vehicle in
shape. I certainly don't need some central authority to enforce personal
vehicle safety and, here in Arkansas, they don't.

Perhaps we should, as a society, simply let the chips fly and hand out
Darwin Awards to those who don't care enough about their own
self-preservation to keep their vehicles roadworthy.
