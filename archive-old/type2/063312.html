Subject: I need help with a dry bake system.

Hello all,
        Today I finished replacing the two front brake lines and hoses on
my '66 Westy.  I also put in a new master cylinder and brake light switch
but I was wondering if anyone could tell me the correct procedure for
getting the fluid to fill up the system.  I tried just filling up the
reservoir and pumping the brake pedal but nothing really happened.  Should
I just bleed each wheel like a normal bleeding operation?  Any other
ideas?  Thanks in advance.
