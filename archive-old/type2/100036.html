Subject: Torque and the rear wheel nuts

After taking in all the info about the rear wheel bearings I wanted to ask
the list what is the preferred method of applying the correct torque the
rear wheel nuts?

I read this interesting Bob Hoover sermon on flywheels.  Does anyone
actually do this with the rear wheels?

&gt; Use the piece of pipe as an extension handle on the breaker bar when removing
&gt; rear wheel nuts or the flywheel bolt. In conjunction with a bathroom scale,
&gt; the pipe-extension also allows you to accurately set the torque on the
&gt; flywheel bolt. (Stand on the scale, grasp the pipe at an accurately measured
&gt; four feet from the socket and pull up while watching the scale. When your
&gt; weight increases by 54 pounds, you've torqued the gland nut to 216 ft/lbs.
&gt; Your anti-torque lever will be sticking out the other way, preventing the
&gt; flywheel from turning as you torque the bolt.)
