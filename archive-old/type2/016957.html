Subject: 30/31 PICT, Engine stalls falling to idle

Fellow listees:

I have a 30/31 PICT replacement carburator, which I think is the cause
of my problem.  The engine stalls when the engine drops to idle rapidly,
such as when I step on the clutch pedal when braking.  Also, the engine
will stall when I (re)start the engine, unless I give it a little tap to
get it past that first second or so after it roars to life.  The engine
idles fine once it's idling.  It doesn't seem to be a brake booster
problem, because while idling, I can pump the brake all I want and it
continues to idle fine.  Since the symptoms are rather specific, I'm
hoping that somebody can confirm or confute my surmise that it is the
carb that's the problem, and perhaps even direct me to the problem with
the carb.  Incidentally, I'm not familiar with the history of this carb;
but I do know that it doesn't respond to air/fuel mixture screw
adjustments.
