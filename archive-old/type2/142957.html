Subject: Re: [T2] High crankcase pressure problem after installing new
  carbs - dangling hose from breather box!?

&gt; After starting up the engine and returning from a test drive I
&gt; noticed oil leaking from the main seal, oil sitting around the
&gt; breather box and my dipstick was raised -&gt; extremely high crankcase
&gt; pressure :-/


There's lots of pressure in the crankcase. That's why a breather is
needed. By kinking the hose you sealed up the case and possibly blew
seals.

Vent outside the engine compartment. Pick up one of those breather
filters like the hotrodders use to keep from putting too much oil
vapors into the environment.

But the best solution would be to drill a hole in one of the air
filter housings and install a nipple as John said. Or you could get a
plactic pcv filter from a flaps for a couple bucks to put inside the
air cleaner with the nipple sticking out of a hole in the housing.
That is my first choice and what I plan to do with my 71 with dual
webers.
