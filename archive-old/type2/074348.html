&lt;&lt; How do transporters get air pressure for the window washer?   If nnot from 
the spare tire, where? &gt;&gt;

From the 50 cent (&quot;...remember when gas stations had free air, etc.&quot;) air
pump. You could also rig a generic pump into the bottle. I understand the
cheapness of using the spare on a Bug as the source of pressure, but I
could also see a long dusty/muddy road and a flat spare at its end...
