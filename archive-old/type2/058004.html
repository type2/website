Subject: F.S.-'72 Westy-How Much?

Hello all,

I've purchase another Westy (in lieu of adding a propane tank and
heater) and must sell the bus which has been the most dependable auto
I've owned.  It may not have always run well, but it always ran.  I
could go on but this is hard enough without dredging up all the good
times had.  Sacrificing style for comfort makes me uncomfortable...

How much $ is too much?  $1700?

For Sale:  1972 VW Bus Campmobile (Westfalia)

2.0 liter engine, 30k on rebuild, runs strong, single-barrel Weber carb.

All records since '90 rebuild.  Brakes and tires are in good condition.
Interior in good shape, sink, ice-box, table, wardrobe, bench seat folds
into bed, completly reupholstered in '84 in striped velour to match the
exterior colors.
Body in fair to poor shape, re-painted in '84 (MB cream over MB navy
blue,) a few dents, rust under windsheild and on most panels, no
rust-through but ready for attention.  Pop-top works, original canvas
has a few small tears.  Screens.
New:  pop-top seals, front door seals, turn signal switch, Hella halogen
headlamps.

Regards,
