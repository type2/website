Subject: Re: Oil Leaks, Pushrod Tube Seals

I suggest you remove the cover plates over the pushrod tubes and high off
to the high pressure wand car wash and blast everthing under there first -
saves a lot of scrubbing with GUM-OUT  later; you want a good finger grip
on those tubes to twist them as you pull them back thru the holes below the
rocker arms.  Should be easy with old seals if any crud is blasted out.  If
any refuse, don't use visegrips, but try a heavy duty duct tape over the
tubes and create an ear you can yank on.  I've also heard of using a
tapered broomstick hammered in that allows some grip.  When at the pool
store today, I noticed one can get rubber plugs with bolts in them and a
wing nut that allows the plug to expand- these if sized right could be
placed in a pushrod tube for pulling or inserting?
   When the o-rings are newly put on, resist the temptation to whack on
them unless you can turn them as you tap- otherwise you can cut the o-ring
edge or it may even pull out and pinch, creating quite an oil leak!
