Subject: Re: [T2] My Canvas Install Experience

jeff,

i did this very thing on wed and thurs...no help of
course.  i too received a gray tent...orange and gray
sound better to me.  feel lucky, i put my tent all of
the way to the top, it appeared to reach, and then i
went inside (since it was 11pm) to go to bed.  the
next morning when i opened up the top, the damn thing
didn't reach.  i got the back sliver to reach, but the
sides and front, however, were not going to reach.

so, i spent all day on thurs. removing a plastic
strip, removing the staples, pulling the canvas down
(almost an inch,) retacking and then reapplying the
strip to 3 sides one by one.  it took me well into the
night to finish getting the bottom metal strip in.

i agree with the lower the top a bit, fasten, lift. 
that is what i had to do.  it looks great, but my
staple gun days were numbered towards the end, and i
have one spot to refasten...2 minute job.  i never
want to see a staple gun again.  my hands will hurt
for days.

it only took 2 of us 3 hours to disconnect, drop, and
load our first engine...2 to put it back.  this canvas
better last...i sure don't want to do it again,
either!
