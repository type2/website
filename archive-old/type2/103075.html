Subject: Possible help in Pitsburgh

hey folks,

My name is nick and I have a 72 westy.  Due to transmission problems I had to park it and to make a long story short it has been sitting for over 2 years.  I sort of have 3 questions. 

1. It has a 1700 GEX engine that I had put in less than 10,000 miles ago which is in good shape but badly out of tune.  Other than the standard tune up proceedures, Is there anything extra I should do becase it has been sitting so long?

2. it has been sitting with probably about 3 gallons of gas in it for all that time.  Should I put anything in the tank like dry gas of a fuel system cleaner or should I just fill it up with fresh gas

3. Since I dont have the money to have other people do my work for me anymore, I was wondering if there was someone in the pittsburgh area with experience who may be willing to come and show me the proper way to do a full tune up (valve adjustment, set timing, ect)  I know the proceedures but would just like if someone who knows how would keep an eye on me and make sure I'm doing it right.  

Let me know folks, and keep on bussin!

Nick
