I use contact cement.  Borden's works good and there's a blue colored
version that really kicks butt.  you can pay the extra $$ for the spray,
or for the thicker type in a tube, but plain old works great for me.

I'm not new to VWs, been on the vintage list.  I'm on this because I
just bought a 70 westfalia and will soon have many camper related Q's
for you gurus
