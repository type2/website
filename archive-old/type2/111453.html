The windshield wiper motor assembly on many Volkswagens does include a
nylon gear pressed onto a knurled steel shaft.  If the nylon gear has
cracked then it will produce exactly the effect you describe.  You will
need to remove and dismantle the wiper assembly to check this.

That gear and shaft are common to many older volkswagens and if you cannot
find an assembly from a transporter then you may be able to find the same
gear in a beetle.

                             OOK!
