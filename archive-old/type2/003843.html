I would like to thank Jamie Rivers on a wonderful job organizing the first
annual Buses By the Falls in the great city of Niagara Falls,
Ontario....there was a great turnout by members from both countries and the
weather was absolutely perfect....the cruise was an interesting event (can
we say TRAFFIC?) and door prizes were wonderful....

I have to thank Ted Finesman for the cherries too....oh my god the
CHERRIES!!

Hope to you at this event next year!!
