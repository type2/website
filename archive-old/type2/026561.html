&gt;I don't think it is fair to Ron &amp; Bus Depot, to air every complaint on here

&gt;before the whole list.  Seems to me that one should first try to resolve 
&gt;problems directly with Bus Depot first.  We all know that Ron has the best
prices 

Amen to that!!  Besides the excellent points you made, another aspect to
consider is if I and everyone else posted every FAVORABLE experience with
Bus Depot (or the other vendors), the list would have twice as many messages
on it every day!  (Thanks for the on fuel tank sendor Ron- it was fast,
friendly and cheap).
