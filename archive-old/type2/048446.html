All american / canadian years were water cooled but the original brazilian fox had a
1300cc then a 1600cc aircooled in it.  Check it out

i think its kinda cool and made me wonder if someone could commit the sin of putting
a fox engine in a bus without modifying the tranny.

&gt; The Fox was aircooled? Are you absolutely sure about this? I thought that all Fox
&gt; models were wasserwagens.
