&lt;&lt; I also plan to put the carpet underneath the drivers and passengers
 seats, where the nasty rubber stuff was originally - mainly 'cuase this
 has fallen to bits, but also 'cause it's very nasty!  This I will then
 glue on using....what?  I guess some sort of carpet glue, if such a
 thing exists...? &gt;&gt;
I've replaced the carpets up front, but only onto the bare floor, no other
insulation. My question is WHY would you want to glue them down?  When I had
to repair the accelerator pedal, I was glad to be able to take them out of
the way.  I can take them out to shampoo, too, and dry in the sun.
 Definitely bind the edges, at least at the sides. The top ( under pedals)
and bottom  (abutting seats and aisle carpeting) won't fray, but the constant
shuffling of feet in and out have frayed my (rubber backed!) carpet pretty
badly.  I trimmed and bound those edges - looks great!
