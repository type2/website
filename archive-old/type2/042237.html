Subject: RE: Diaphragm-type vacuum unit

OK, here goes...
There is a spring loaded flap that is operated by intake vacuum.  This flap
controls the mixture of cold air (through that round hole in the right) and
warm air (through the tin from #1 cylinder) into the air cleaner.  The idea
being that the engine runs better when cold with pre-heated air but is more
efficient with cold air.  Pay attention at the back there.  Are you chewing?
The default position of the flap with no vacuum is to allow just cold air
through.  So the more vacuum you let through, the warmer the air will be.
This is where the thermostat comes in.  This device sits in the airflow
between the air cleaner and the RH carb, so it's measuring the air temp just
before it goes into the carb.  It switches the vacuum on and off to the
flap.  The other port on it should go to a point on the balance pipework
under the air cleaner, facing toward the rear.  It will probably be capped
off at the moment, otherwise you will have a big vacuum leak.
You are right about the cold air intake hose.  It should be tied to the body
on a bracket, just above the battery.  It's no big deal if this is missing
but the air won't be quite as cold as it could be.
I don't know what the official testing method for this stuff is, I usually
employ the time-honoured technique of testing vacuum stuff - put a hose on
it and suck.

&gt; See Fig. 6-3, pg 26, Fuel System in Bentley.
&gt; 
&gt; What is this and what does it do? It's some sort of intake 
&gt; air preheating
&gt; system, but I'm fuzzy on the concept.
&gt; 
&gt; Mine was missing and it was suggested I should have one to at 
&gt; least block
&gt; off the large hole at the bottom right front of the engine 
&gt; compartment. I
&gt; found one at a junkyard and I've installed it. Out of the 
&gt; right side of it
&gt; is a large opening, maybe 1.5-2&quot; in diameter. Does this hook up to
&gt; something, and if so, what? It looks like an accordion-like 
&gt; air hose would
&gt; fit on it.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, the right &quot;horn&quot; of the air cleaner has two vacuum 
&gt; hook-ups on the
&gt; thermostatic vacuum valve; the brass one that hooks up to the 
&gt; vacuum unit
&gt; (check), and the other one. What does the other one hook up 
&gt; to? I've got it
&gt; capped for now.
&gt; 
&gt; Bentley says: &quot;If the thermostatic valve or vacuum unit is 
&gt; defective, it
&gt; should be replaced.&quot; How do you know if they're defective?
