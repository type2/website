Vanbondo was following up on a site associated with &quot;Communication Arts&quot;
magazine. It is primarily a pub for designers etc.
There was a section which features the 1995- 96 WWW site design winners.
*Here's the point*
One of the winners was Mercedes. Scrolling around the form/frame you will
find a section for new Mercedes vans/buses!!! Unfortunately, with the
limited amount of time that I had to look at the site, I did not find a
&quot;Camper/Westy&quot; type option. Overall the design/style is the typical &quot;Baby
van&quot; design. Checkit out at:
