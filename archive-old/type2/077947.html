&gt; &lt;&lt; Added fiberglass wrap ($6.99_at_ Home Depot), and now I pull 140 degrees at
&gt; the
&gt; dash vents before the air mixes with the cab air. I don't think off gassing
&gt; is a concern at this temperature. (If I'm wrong, let me know before I either
&gt; die or loose more brain cells.) &gt;&gt;

&gt; Only problem might be water retention by that 'glass wrap...How are you
&gt; sealing it against rain, etc.?

VW used fiberglass with a vinyl cloth outer layer.  Still intact on my
bus.

I think that the plastic backed fiberglass as sold for water heater
blankets would work fine.  Wrap it around several times, make sure the
edge os on the bottom, and that should keep water out nicely.

Don't try to seal it up perfectly, as that is a sure way to keep any water
that does get in, in.
