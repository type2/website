Subject: [T2] '77 Progress Report &amp; Yellow Jackets!

Hi Folks,
     I made a significant amount of progress on the '77 this weekend. From 
the rear of the sliding door all the way around to the back of the drivers 
side door is done. Many (maybe 15-20) small rust spots all ground down and 
repaired. Some became holes, so I got out the mig welder and filled them in. 
Most, however, had good metal underneath, and a thin skim of Metal-2-Metal 
filler took care of those. I do have one problem though that is quite odd for 
January. I have already found and removed 6 yellow jacket nests from my 
Westy. I've found them in the fender well underneath the battery, under the 
sliding door track cover, and in the air intake vents. There must be more, 
however. When I turn on the heat in the garage it is &quot;waking &quot; them up, as I 
found two more crawling on me this weekend, but I can't find the other 
nest(s). I suspect there could be more underneath the pop top as the seal is 
totally shot. Today I did a good portion of the undercarriage with POR 15, 
nasty stuff but it works. Placed an order from Bus Depot this week for the 
two replacement panels I need, the lower skin for the sliding door and 
passenger side lower cab step. Still hope to have her ready for Everybus 
2001!      Jeff S.
