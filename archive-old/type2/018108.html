Subject: Incompatable heads/exhaust
Message-ID: &lt;3745CC0C.7791F9AA_at_net-link_dot_net&gt;

Here's a boner I pulled this month.

Progress on the '76 Wety restoration was progressing nicely; sandblast
down to metal, reprime with DP-40, call Ron at Bus Depot and tell him to
ship me one of everything, etc.

Engine doesn't look worth saving, the PO drove about 10,000 miles
without any cooling system integrety, so I ordered a -new- AVP engine
through the Bus Depot.  I took the engine number off the fan housing and
asked for a '79, just like mine.

Sandblasted all of the cooling tin, replaced the missing ones and welded
in patches where the PO took 'short cuts' with tin snips instead of
removing things.  I even bead blasted the fan housing, etched it and
painted it body color.  Put everything together on the engine stand.

I just tried to put on the exhaust headers and it would appear that the
'76 exhaust is incompatable with the '79 heads.  There are castings tack
welded to the exhaust headers that allow an inch or so of the header to
stick up though the casting, and on the new engine the studs aren't
anywhere close to reaching through the cast ears.  The mounting surface
on the new engine is just above the top of the pushrods.  I am seriously
bumming.

I'm going to drink a beer, then go down and measure to see if cutting
off the tubing that sticks out above the casting with ears will make
everything line up heightwise.  I welcome anyone's experience/insight in
how to fix this mismatch of my own doing.

TIA
