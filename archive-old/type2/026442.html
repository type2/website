Good day,
On Monday of this week, I was driving home when I saw out of the corner of
my eye a lonely VW bus sitting under a tree with a &quot;for sale&quot; sign in the
window.  I had been looking for a donor car for a kit-car project I have
been contemplating, so I pulled over to investigate.  

It turns out this Bus is a 1972 model, with the orange side panels.  The
interior looked stock but had been &quot;rearranged&quot; to accomodate a wheelchair
at some point.  The interior panelling and trim look really good however.

The engine runs, but smokes, and sounds pretty rough.  As far as rust goes,
there are a few holes in the floorpan, the rear portions of the front wheel
wells look nasty, and the sill plate under the sliding door is gone.

The owner came out and we started talking about the car, it hasn't been
driven regularly for four years.  

Perhaps someone can help with this:  the odometer reads 07691, and has
obviously turned over at least once....how can you tell whether that's
107691, 207691 or higher?  I live on an island, and the bus lived here it's
whole life, so it's not inconceivable that it's only turned over once?

In any case, the owner said he'd sell it to me for $200 CDN ($140US), I
agreed!

But now I don't want to slice it up for the kit project!  I've fallen in
love with the thing, rats nests in the engine compartment and all!  I was
born the same year this bus rolled off the line in Germany, which may have
somthing to do with the appeal.  

In any case, I'm set up for bodywork in my garage, with a gas and MIG
welder, and a full set of automotive tools....

Can anyone reccomend a really good book on bus restoration?  I want to keep
the bus totally stock with the exception of engine improvements.

Thanks
