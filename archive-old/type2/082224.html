&lt;&lt; Thanks for confirming that I have a worn synchro.  How 'bout the defroster?

OK, you have a worn defroster (Sorry) ...
Check the horizontal tubes coming off the vertical tube...A PITA to clean
but I found a few years of assorted debris in mine that had been dropped
through the top holes and found their way to the louvres at the bottom.
If you take the time to unscrew the tin atop the dash and remove the
radio, you should have enough room to remove the tops of the defroster
tubes and get a vacuum hose on the tubes. With the engine running and
blowing from there, and the vacuum sucking, it just might suck the stuff
out...You could be surprised at what's down there...
