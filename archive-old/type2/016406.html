Subject: Re: Number 3 inlet valve problem

It would be interesting to see how quickly the valve gets out of
adjustment. If it's just a few minutes, then I wouldn't be too concerned
about the valve stretching. Instead, it *might* be caused by an unevenly
worn adjusting screw or an unevenly worn lifter; those are easy to
replace. Or could it be an asymmetrically worn valve stem? (in which
case the head would have to be pulled)
