Subject: :) Turning air cooled into water cooled

On NPR this morning...

The New York Museum of Natural History is going to take a
VW bug and drop it into the murky waters of Lake Erie. They are
doing a project on Zebra Mussels (sp?), and will take the 
zebra-coated bug out in November, shellac it, and put it on display
in an endangered species exhibit. There was a short sound-byte on why
they choose a VW bug- &quot;everyone loves it; it's a common car- not an
elitist car&quot; etc etc. 

Of course, the irony of the air cooled engine was lost..
