Subject: Accelerator pedal troubles

Hello-
I was driving the bus the other day and the whole accelerator pedal bent 
over to the left and with it an obvious decrease in power.
I am able to manually finesse the pedal into the right position with my 
foot, but have looked and cannot figure out how to disassemble the pedal 
mechanism to really look at what needs repair.
It looks like the pedal is loose from the hinge plate as it keeps 
slipping to the left
The plate underneath the floor is still connected and the rod that the 
pedal pivots on isn't broken.
I was unable to find anything in the archives that described how to 
repair this problem. Do I need to just get a whole new assembly?
Thanks for any help.
