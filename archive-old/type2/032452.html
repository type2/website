For some unknown cyber space related reason, I seem to be getting emails addressed directly to me that should be going to someone else.  I am NOT the one who wants to go 90 mph in my bus (I get nervous when I approach 60 mph!!)  Anyway, I did respond to this post and maybe my email address got put into the &quot;reply-to&quot; slot. Oh well, no big deal. 



Peace, John Baker
