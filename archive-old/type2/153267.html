Subject: Running rich when warm issue is back (On my knees begging for
  help)

List,

 

I thought that I had this issue licked but apparently not. The other morning
I was dropping my boy off at middle school ad on the way back it started
running rough. Within a couple of blocks it got progressively worse until it
started popping, wheezing and bucking. I knew what this meant and I knew
what was coming. Pretty soon it would just stall on me. I tried to keep the
rpms up because it seems to run fine if I keep the tach around 3k. Anything
less and pluhhh, it just pops sputters and dies. I got caught at a 4 way
stop where I couldn't slip the clutch enough to keep the rpm's up and it
stalled. I waited the 30 or so minutes for the engine to cool down and it
started. I barely got it into the driveway before it stalled again. A little
history on what I've replaced in order to solve this issue is:

 

-          Replaced Plugs (gaped .28)

-          Replaced Wires

-          Replaced Points (gaped .016)

-          Statically timed the engine to 7.5 degrees BTDC

-          Replaced condenser

-          Replaced Coil

-          Replaced the head temperature sensor

-          Replaced Fuel pressure regulator

-          Removed cold start air valve (plugged the plenum hole off)

-          Bypassed cold start injector

-          Checked for vacuum leaks. Replaced the questionable hoses.

-          Put hose clamps on whatever hoses I could

-          Fuel injector cleaner in the gas tank.

 

 

 I originally thought that I might have found my issue to be a loose fuel
injector wire. Looking back on that I guess it doesn't make sense because at
worst it would run but just run rough. I pulled the plugs out and they are
all black and sooty as if the fuel system is just dumping gas in. 

 

Just to restate. It runs just fine when it isn't fully warmed up. Great in
fact. As soon as it gets to operating temp then it coughs and sputters and
just shuts off.

 

HELP!
