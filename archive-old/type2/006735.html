  I am re-paneling my '71 hardtop camper with Baltic Birch.  I can 
purchase it in 5' x 5' sheets which will take care of every panel 
except one.  The panel on the side, behind the driver's seat is 71&quot;
long, so 5' x 5' will not do the job.  The original panel that I 
removed is one piece, but the only way I can replace it will be to 
piece the new one together.  Talked to my supplier of Baltic Birch and
he said he gets his panels from the largest supplier that he knows of
and they do not carry Baltic Birch in sheets larger than 5' x 5'.
Does everyone else piece their side paneling in the area I am referring
to???  Thanks.
