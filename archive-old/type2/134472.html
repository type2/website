Subject: [T2] How to remove a rear drum on a 71-79 bus

Best way I've found to remove the drums is to loosen the big nut.
Drive around the block with the lug nuts and big nut slightly loose.
If the drum doesn't want to get loose I then bounce it over a few curbs at
near stall speeds.
After the drum has some minor play I back off on the shoes and bring on the
big rubber hammer.
I've always gotten them off this way.
