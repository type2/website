He said it can't be fixed just adjusted every now 
&gt; and then to minimize the back firing but never stopping it.  Is this true?


Hogwash.  Never heard a backfire out of my bus - single weber, type4 1800.  Nothing ever 'shuts off gas flow completely to the carb' unless you turn off the engine.

Five bucks says your backfiring is an exhaust leak or a timing/vac advance thing.

&gt; remaining gas in the carb.  &gt;
