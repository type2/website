Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [VB] Overheating / to those who use Gene Berg,
  dipstick oil temp sensor

To back John's claim up: I now have ~500 miles on the alternator belt
and the sides look  flat black, like they were on the new belt. Tells
me it does not slip.

Both generator belts I tried got the shiny sides rather quickly even
though they were tight.

John, could you tell us the range of the vacuum advance on the SVDA
you sell ?  Maybe it is top secret :-)

&gt; The alternator belt also takes more load before it slips, which is why VW
&gt; change the belts with the alternator/doghouse combo. The gen belt slips
much
&gt; sooner then most would care to know about, and this results in hotter
&gt; running temps with a gen belt instead of an alternator belt. IMO, if you
&gt; have a doghouse fan OR an alternator, you need an alternator belt.
