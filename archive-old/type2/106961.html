Subject: Re: [T2] 72-79 Pickups' rarity

I agree with the &quot;chicken war&quot; stuff.  Here in Arkansas where
1 in ever 12th person works for a poultry company, it must have been a big 
deal....sort of like the Russians screwing around with the import of
chicken parts now.

The deceased owner of the poultry company that I worked for appeared
on the cover of Life? magazine with a &quot;bunch&quot; of chickens.  They still
had the sign(in storage) that was made for the parking lot that said...

&quot;No Volkswagons allowed&quot;   Notice the misspelling!

The current(son and great grandson) owners both own German cars.  LOL

I understand that we can now import 25+ year vehicles without much 
problem...time to go to Canada and find what you want!

Cheers,dave

&gt; Apparently, the US put a huge import duty on german trucks 
&gt;in 1971 as a result of high german import duties on US chickens!
