Regards all, first post coming at you, hoping that someone may know what
this is... and not laugh too hard at me.
Rebuilding my first engine, a '76 2L for a '74 chasis using the muir bible
(that should stir it up a bit :)) 18th edition and on page 291, last para,
it says to find the &quot;thermostat actuating lever&quot;.
My question is... is there any chance that I don't have one of these?  I can
not locate anything that appears to be this piece and am 99% certain that
nothing has walked out of my garage.

Thoughts?

thanks in advance
