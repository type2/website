&gt; Yup, all you need are the heads and complete manifold setup, and new tin.
&gt;Jet
&gt;&gt; for the new setup and your good to go.
&gt;&gt; Chuck
&gt;&gt; whos done it on his &quot;70
&gt;
&gt;Not quite good to go yet......
&gt;Nobody mentioned replacing the middle upper 2 head studs on each side with
&gt;shorter ones.....
&gt;
&gt;
Well heck, because your going to get a few more HP, that means hotter running so you might as well start looking for a doghouse
cooling setup(fan shroud, front tin, flaps, connecting rod, cooler)
