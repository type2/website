&gt; Does anyone know how much clearance there is between

There's really a significant amount of space, but do
you really want sheet metal screws sticking toward the
tank?
You might consider mounting it to an intermediate
plate and pop-riveting the plate in place. Or
pop-rivet threaded adapters that provide a
machine-screw female thread in a very short package -
only about 1/4&quot; protrudes.

When I put the Subey in, I attached probably a dozen
electrical junction blocks, fuse blocks, relays, etc.
to the firewall and used sheetmetal screws for all. I
had checked previously for adequate clearance and
although I don't remember what it is, I was not at all
concerned anymore after checking! -BaH
