Subject: 68 to 73 westy curtains wanted

Hi,

I have a partial set of the brown, yellow and white checked curtains 
that came stock with 1968 to 1973 Westfalia camper conversions. I 
would like to complete my set. I need rear window and side window 
which may actually be the same size curtain panel size. If you have 
some curtains in decent shape and would like them to have a good home 
please email me.

Also has anyone out the curtains in a washing machine? Did they survive?

Thanks

See you at EveryBus!!!!!!!
