Type II electric motor types - I thought I'd successfully sent this out
yesterday, but I didn't notice it in today's mail, so I'm trying again.

&gt;&gt;By all means send him my e-mail address, I am rebuilding the bus this
&gt;&gt;winter for the third time. It will continue to run the roads!!
&gt;&gt;yours, topher
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Topher is Topher Waring, a middle school shop teacher in VT who I contacted
&gt;perhaps a year ago after reading about him in a National Geographic World
&gt;(NG for kids).  He has a 71 that he's converted to all electric power and
&gt;his schoolkids have to reinstall the whole works every year as part of
their
&gt;work:  motor, batteries, disconnects, etc.  It's a great story, and he does
&gt;it on a school budget shoestring.  The kids cut their own adaptor plate out
&gt;of plate aluminum.  It functions as a bus (imagine, a bus as a real bus)
and
&gt;errand runner for the school.
&gt;
&gt;He's given his permission to be thrown into our soup (I hope he meant that
&gt;by the note above).  I don't have a record of who was asking for electric
&gt;motor information, but there were several.  So email him personally, as far
&gt;as I know he isn't a listee.  He is tymzdork_at_sover_dot_net . Good luck to all.
&gt;I'd like to do it myself some day.
