&gt; Advantages of doing the ceramic coating in the first place elude me.

I recommend ceramic coating to anyone who has just bought new heat
exchangers and we send the parts out for our customers whenever they opt for
the coating. There are many reasons to do it, foremost is that is stops the
parts from rusting. It doesn't get &quot;blasted off&quot; in my experience, if the
parts are done with silver and polished. One side benefit of ceramic coating
is that it makes the HE more efficient, it is a thermal barrier and as such
is keeps the heat inside the HE. Engines with ceramic coated HE will make a
bit more heat. It also looks awesome. There are no downsides to ceramic
coating except it isn't free.
