I was also thinking that probably more miles have been put on aircooled VW
Buses than any other van/truck ever.  1950-something till '83.  That's a lot
of roadtrips and there are still tons of buses with 250,000 miles on them.

I talked to one old man a short while ago who had 425,000 miles on his bus
before he retired it. Jan B
