Subject: Re: [T2] more 79 cali distributor 




&gt; OK more opinions requested here. To recap, 78 2L rebuilt with about 15K on
&gt; it, stock FI, 140psi comp all around. I upgraded to a 79 Calif distributor
&gt; electronic ignition setup. The coil is still the Bosch Blue but will be
&gt; replaced with a electronic ignition coil (what years Rabbit and Audi are
&gt; correct?).

Early Rabbits with electronic ignition. Not the later ones. The early ones are
easy to spot by the connecter on the distributor. It will be a slip on. Later
ones have a metal clip. The coil will have part # 211 xxx xxx B on the bottom.
C is the later, wrong, one.

&gt; The question is timing. My mechanic had me connect the vac advance and cap
&gt; the retard. He then timed it to 8 BTDC at idle. It runs great.
&gt; He said I didn't need the retard. When I pressed him on it he pointed out
&gt; that I didn't have my EGR connected and I had a 78 engine, cam and FI
&gt; brain. I shouldn't connect the retard with a setup like that since things
&gt; were different on the 79 Calif FI brain. A recent thread said that this
&gt; timing is pretty close when your not using the retard, tho I think it's a
&gt; little retarded. The correct timing with the retard vac connected is 5
&gt; ATDC. I haven't checked what my total advance is at 3600RPM, the specs say
&gt; it should be 21-25 with this distributor.

Do not cap the retard side. Leave it open.
You are not adding all the advances up. 21-25 is only the centrifugal part.
You also get 11-13 vacuum + 7.5 initial. [in you case 8]
8 + 11-13 + 21-25 = 40-46 [if you rev the engine with a timing light on, it
will usually go to the o in vor, past 40 on the scale]



&gt; Opinions? I don't have all the parts for the EGR which I really should get
&gt; hooked up since it cools the engine, but is the 78 Fed engine/FI different
&gt; enough from the 79 CA engine/FI that I should NOT connect the retard
&gt; vaccuum and reset the time to correct specs?

Take a look at the specs for the 78 dist, 021 P or 022 S on page 75 of section
5 in the 68-79 Bentley, and compare them to the 039 C on page 80. Almost
identical except for the retard side. Always set the engine to the distributor
you have. If you don't use the retard side, subtract the total retard amount
from the initial correct timing. 5 after minus 13 = 8 before.
