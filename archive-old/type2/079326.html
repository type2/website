Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Aux Battery systems was  Charging Spare-Beckett's tome re
 Hella kit and wiring size

As an ex-Navy Electrician I enjoy these discussions and usually find myself 
smarter for it in the end.

Fire away. I might even remember a few things I want to ask before it is 
all over. Just keep the subject lines concise and to the point (accurate) 
so I can save any good messages.

(I've forgotten alot of info in the past 6 years!!! Not much left when I 
figure how little I think I really knew well.)

&gt;There are a lot of misconceptions, old wive's tales, tall stories, etc. on 
&gt;electricity in general.  It would be nice to clear things up a bit.
