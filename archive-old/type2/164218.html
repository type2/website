Subject: re:New panel clips, drill size? Plastic sheeting on front doors

I've got some new door panels I plan on installing this weekend. I would
like to cut some holes in the panels to mount some speakers. I have made a
template out of cardboard, to locate holes.

Any suggestions on ways to do this.maybe things you guys have done and
regretted, or things you have done that worked great/made the job easier.

My thought was to mark the speaker hole location. Cut the vinyl with a
knife, then cut the panel with a jig saw. Then the plastic sheeting on back
of door panel, and on door.

I missed the fact that I need to drill the holes out larger, but good catch
