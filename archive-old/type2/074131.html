Subject: RE: F.S. Banjo fittings for oil-pressure gauge sender installation


&gt;Just make sure you don't use teflon tape or anything that insulates the 
&gt;current
&gt;transfer. I used locktite but made sure I did not apply it to the entire 
&gt;surface. I left 25% of the male mating surface at the tip uncoated
&gt;so it could make proper contact. Don't put any on the female surface or it 
&gt;will end up covering everything.

I did it too a few years ago and yes it works well. It can break off if 
knocked around alot.

Instead of thread locker (Loc-Tite) get a bottle of hydraulic system 
sealant (also made by Loc-Tite). It is used just like thread locker but 
seals up hydraulic fittings wonderfully. One bottle will last you years!

I'm sure there are other brands too.
