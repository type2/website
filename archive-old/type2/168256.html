&gt; I agree- We looked at the Toureg (a heavy &quot;tank&quot;) and wanting a 4WD,

&gt; Shoulda launched the Mew Microbus!  My daughter (the next generation,

The problem seems simple to me. There are only a few types of cars on the
road. Luxury/sport, economy, family and classic soul.

VW had made cars for almost 50 years that to this day still turn heads. They
are more than cars, they are conversation pieces, they have a spirit. With
the exception of newer high-end sports cars that are not seen every day, or
cars that look &quot;interesting&quot; but truly lack the karmatic appeal that VW, BMW
and anything pre-1980 had, cars today are just cars.

Let's face it, the only cars out there that make me go DAAAAMN are $50K
Mercedes that look like they are going 200 MPH while in a parking stall,
rock crawlers and concept cars. The &quot;soul&quot; of the car and passion that went
into designing a great, durable, reliable and easily maintainable car is
long gone.

There seem to be two types of vehicles built with the VW stamp nowadays.
There is the Volkswagen and the VW... it seems to me that if you refer to
your vehicle as a &quot;Volkswagen&quot; (without first inserting classic the year
with a huge sense of pride) , then the name Ratwell means nothing to you.

Hence the reason why we all name our buses and older cars, but most of us
just simply refer to our newer cars by the name stamped on the grill.
