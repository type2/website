Subject: 2.0 Update

Hello All,

Here's the update.  

I went and got a temp sensor today, but for the life
of me, I could not get it to thread into the hole, so
I did what the doctor suggested and wedged it in under
some tin.  Now it starts up fine but roars to a high
idle, lasts for a few seconds, and then wants to
die....I can keep it going if I get on the throttle
before it dies.  If I give it a little blip, it roars
back to life and it would seem like I could do this
indefinately.  Just can't get it to idle on its own. 
I have tried adjustments in both directions on the
idle setting with no change.  I ran out of light today
(actually just got too tired to keep going) and will
do more maybe tomorrow.

Baffled in BC.

Sam
