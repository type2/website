&gt;Hi
&gt;
&gt;I'm a new guy who sent a message earlier but never saw it.  Maybe I did
&gt;something wrong? whatever.  Anyways, a little history, I sold my '90
&gt;Subaru Legacy Wagon with 79K miles on it in top shape, with lots of
&gt;suspension and stereo upgrades an exhaust an intake, new plug wires all
&gt;the usual import stuff for $6800 dollars and bought a '79 bus with
&gt;interior from a '73 westfalia and a CD player for $1800.

Broke?  By my calculations you should have $5,000 in the bank!  :)

&gt;	Anyways, today I decided to take care of those oil cooler seals
&gt;and stop that oil leak.  Saw someone say it took them 4-5 hours so i
&gt;allowed plenty of time.  I've never worked on a VW before and it was an
&gt;experience.  Since the bus ran well and i didn't know jack about the
&gt;engines I bought it without really looking at the engine. a mistake!
&gt;Since the halves of my fan housing wouldn't seperate while in the bus it

You will never have to separate the halves.  If you take the fan out (three
bolts, leave the one in the center there) there will be four nuts which you
remove to release the housing as one piece.

&gt;looked for a short while like the exhaust manifolds/heat exchangers would
&gt;have to be dropped for the housing to be removed.  I loosened the right
&gt;side but it wasn't going easy so i stopped.  I worked/tugged out a
&gt;different manner for removing the fan housing and everything is still
&gt;intact.  I replaced the oil cooler seals which looked brand new and quite
&gt;clean with no signs of oil leaking from around them.  Oh well.  Throughout

More likely it was the sender located just above the oil cooler - did you
notice oil coming from it?

&gt;Sorry for the length but I needed to vent.

No problem, that's what we're here for!

&gt;	What to do?  Obviously remove stud as described in Idiots guide.
&gt;I doubt it will unscrew.  So if I have to drill it do I need to re-tap the
&gt;hole for a new stud? What size tap? Where to get it? What size stud? Where
&gt;to get it?  Will it be bigger?  Will I need to drill the bracket on the
&gt;exhaust manifold out for this bigger stud?  Do I have to pull the
&gt;engine? Can all this be done from below? Please help?  By the way I don't
&gt;know much about what I'm doing so try to make any instructions simple and
&gt;detailed.

You should first go to www.type2_dot_com and look through the archives.  Most
of your questions have been answered before.  Since you're new, I'll
summarize a few of them.

DON'T use an easy out.  Try to unscrew the stud however you can.  If that
fails, I recommend drilling it out and tapping.  Go to a GOOD tool store
(i.e. not Northern Hydraulics or Harbor Frieght) and throw yourself upon
their mercy.  They will tell you what you need.  You can either go helicoil
with stock studs or tap the hole to 9 or 10mm and use stepped studs (bigger
on one end than the other).  Either way you won't have to drill out the
holes in your exchangers.  It can all be done from below without removing
the engine.  Clean the area, put a blanket down, maybe even an old pillow.
Get comfortable, you'll be there for a while.  Stock studs are 8mm, stepped
can either be 8x9 or 8x10.  I usually go for the 8x10 - bigger is stronger.
Most important thing is make sure you tap the hole straight.  Use grease on
the tap and clean it frequently.  Go slowly.

&gt;That $5000 you think I have from selling the other car all got spent on
&gt;school so I really have about $300 I can spend but I need to buy food and

Oh, I understand now.

&gt;gas too for amonth or two.  I'll have money for a rebuild kit or paint or
&gt;other things in June but untill then I guess I'll just have the loudest
&gt;bus in town.  So the cheapest worthwhile fix would be appreciated.  But
&gt;feel free to outline the ideal fix and maybe I'll wait till June.

You should be able to get the tap/bits/studs/helicoil/whatever for under
$50.  You can fix it with that.  Don't overtighten the exhaust studs.  Use
lots of anti-sieze on the nuts.  Use loctite on the end of the studs that
go in the head.  Make sure the copper gaskets on top of the exchangers go
on straight.  Glue them to the exchangers if you have to.  Keep us posted...
