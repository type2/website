Subject: Re:&quot;71 1600westy/oil temp.

Well, I hope I do this right since it is my first time.  
Background:  &quot;71 1600 westy.  Bought at 54K.  Been stored in barn for 
many years.  After cleaning up, repairing most rubber goods, drove it.  
It seemed to be heating up.  Dropped engine found many mud darber nests 
in cooling system.  Since had engine out did top O.H.
New heads, cylinders, dished pistons, put in CB maxi pump#3 with hookup 
to PH8A filter.  Also put in oil sump and new stock oil cooler.  Put in 
VDO oil temp dipstick sensor and oil pressure guage.....WHEW..!!!  
I am using 20-50 oil.  Here during summer temp. gets to 100 degrees.
Driving at 3500 rpm (55mph) temp,stays at 195-200 degrees increasing to 
60mph at approx, 3700rpm temp goes up to 210 degrees, pressure stays at 
40-45 psi.  At idle it is 200-210 degrees reads 10psi and quickly picks 
up if driving in town (idle oil presure approx. 20).  
My question is at what oil temp. should I begin to worry it is too hot?
What constant speed should I be able to run at that will keep my sweetie, 
&quot;Red Leaping Lena Lobster&quot; happy, and me, without worry of doing her 
gizzard harm.  Have more questions but this is long enough.  Any answers 
will be appreciated.
