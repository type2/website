Subject: Picked up some relays from Type2 today, what are they?

 I cannot match these no's for the relays I picked up from a derelict van
today. They almost match but the first 3 no's are different from anythng I
can find at any of the vendors on the net. They are no'd 111 953 227D , 411
941 583C ,
and 111 951 307B. They all have the VW Audi stamps on them, but darned if I
can match them to anything. They came from a mid 70's to late Type2
automatic van. I'm beat on this one.
Thanks,
Courtney
