The manufacturer is actually called Eriba. The Puck is from the &quot;Touring&quot;
line and has been available for a long time (and still is!). They changed
very little over time.

I had one (a '86)  for a short while, sold it and even made a small profit
from it (normally I only loose when I sell stuff). They are very sought
after. They are lightweight and hence ideal for our underpowered buses. I
towed it behind my '69 bus and on the flat hardly noticed it was there. It
has the same general profile as a bus so the combination looks nice. I sold
it because I decided it was too small for me (I'm 6 foot 4).

Eriba is from France but owned by the German Hymer company. Hymer is well
known for their campers (purpose built bigger than VW's).
The French website is currently under construction but their Dutch website
is up. see http://www.eriba.nl Click on Touring &gt; Puck and you'll get all
the dimensions.
