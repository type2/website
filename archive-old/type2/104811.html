Subject: Re: WVA I-77 / free camp spot

&gt;Not to dissuade you, and I love West &quot;by God&quot; 
Virginia, but I remember making some of the
grades at little more than 30mph loaded 
down, northbound anyways. 

That's consistent with our last trip north on I77
out of EB2002.  We had a couple of 1600 buses and
some not so well tuned T4 buses.  There were
stretches where 40 mph was pushing it.  And one
bus developed issues later that might have been
due to overheating and keeping our foots to deep
into the accelerator.  

Caravan tips:  fastest bus in the rear, slowest
up front.  The slowest bus may be the one with
the bigger engine but the sloppy steering.  Keep 
lotsa space between the buses, especially the
last bus. Sometimes a stray truck comes flying
towards the convoy at 78+ mph.  The last bus
needs to be able to accelerate some while the
truck tries to slow and merge left.  On the side
roads, we pulled off the road often so as to keep
traffic from lining up too far.
