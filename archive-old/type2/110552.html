Subject: grab handles etc

Does anyone have any extra grab &quot;handles&quot; for a 72 
that would be willing to sell? I just put the new door
panels I ordered on and am now really challenged to
close the doors.  I need 2.

Also, does anyone have any 'idiot proof' tips on
wiring up a vdo temp gauge?  I have the gauge and the
dipstick sender but the wiring kit I ordered is no
longer available according to the guy at The Bus Depot
that left me a messege?  With the weather getting
warmer, I would like to have this hooked up.

thanks for any and all help
