Subject: help me remove my head

Hey,

Trying to remove the head off my parts engine.  Using Bentley as a reference 
and go through the procedure but it didn't mention (or i missed it) about 
the tube thingys at the bottom.  There are three of them belove the valves 
that connect the head to the crankcase.

What are those?  How do i get those off?
I think that's the only thing holding my head on.

Thanks in advance,

Daniel
