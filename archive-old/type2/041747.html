Subject: VW Insulation!

Hello Everyone,

I intend to remove the interior of my '74 Westy and install Q-pads. I'll
also undercoat my Bus.  However, I'm unsure about what to do with the engine
compartment.  I read the Heat, Insulation....web page, but seems like the
highly reflective Nasa Insulation would increase the heat in the engine
compartment.  (General consensus seems to be keep everything black to help
keep the engine cool).  Wouldn't the reflective insulation around the motor
increase heat?  Second, if I were to install Q-pads inside the engine
compartment to reduce noise &amp; heat, would that increase engine heat as well?
Not sure what to do here!

Thanks for your suggestions,

Darrin K. Pierce
