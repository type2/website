&gt; Anybody know if VW is the only one acting this protective of its
&gt; various signs and logos? Most of the other vendors to old/antique
&gt; cars use the name with apparent impunity...Obsolete Ford, for ex-
&gt; ample.

I've heard of some action regarding the Chevy bow-tie emblem, but nothing
near the rabid hostility of VW.  Most of the action appears to be aimed
toward parts stamped with the bow-tie, not with logoed items like coffee
cups.  Chevy knows free advertising when they see it.

Of course, if you really want to feel legal pain, put the words &quot;Harley
Davidson&quot; on something and try to sell it.  Since all Harley has to sell
is their image (they gave up trying to compete with the Japanese in
quality in the '70s) they guard their trademarks (H-D, Harley Davidson,
HOG, etc.) like gold.  They even tried (unsuccessfully) to trademark
their engine sound.
