Subject: Re: [T2] Gas gauge problem

&gt; My '77 Westy's gas gauge always reads dead empty - the needle is pegged
&gt; low. I put a meter on the wire and see an oscillating signal - the needle
&gt; bumps up once or twice a second. Is that normal?
&gt;
&gt; My fear is that there's a sender problem. How does one access the sender?

first a little troubleshooting.
pull the wire from the sender and ground it.
does your gauge read full or otherwise?

if the gauge reads full it is probably the sender.
you need to pull the tank (and engine) to get to it or do the access hatch
mod.

if it reads otherwise then you may have a wiring problem, a gauge problem
or a problem with the voltage stabiliser (if there is one mounted to the
back of the gauge)
