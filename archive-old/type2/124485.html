Subject: Re: [T2] FI vacuum dizzy on 73

From Don :


 Well, I really need to figure out this vacuum advance thing.
The 73 has a vacuum cutoff switch (that was disabled obviously when
the 009 was in there) that only allows vacuum when 4th gear is engaged
or when the temps are really low.
What benefit does this have in the performance of the engine?

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

The 'no advance until 4th' was part of the attempt to cut down on Nox emissions
in the early seventies. Besides cutting Nox, it also cut power and cut fuel mileage
dramatically.

If you can find your timing mark.... easy way to do it:
Remove 3/4 valve cover.
Rotate the engine in the direction of rotation and watch the #3 cylinder valves.
The exhaust will open and then close. Immediately after the exhaust closes the intake
will open. If the intake does not immediately open, you are going the wrong way!
Rotate the engine and watch the valves. JUST as the exhaust closes and JUST as the intake starts to move,
STOP. Look at your crank pully. You should have the mark on zero [within a degree or 2]. This is the point of
rocking and the opposite cylinder in the firing order will be at TDC to fire. In this case, #1.
Now pop your dist cap off and see where the rotor is pointing. It should be at the index point for #1. If not,
your dist drive is installed wrong. If it is wrong, you have a couple of choices.
1) pull the dizzy, lift up the drive, and turn to the correct position.  [the right way]
2) mark where the rotor is pointing and move the plug wires accordingly [the shade tree way]

Now after all the marks are lined up [hopefully the right way so the next person that works on it isn't
baffled.....]  start the engine. Leave the vacuum hose OFF. Set the timing at 7.5 before.
At idle, connect the vacuum hose and check timing. Is it still at 7.5 before? Yes, GOOD.
No? Then you are using the wrong source for vacuum. You need to use ported vacuum, not manifold vacuum. Ported
vacuum is vacuum that comes from just aboce the throttle plate. It appears just as you open the throttle.

Once you get the vacuum correct, disconnect it again. Timing should still be at 7.5 before, correct?
Now run the rpms up to around 3400 and watch where the timing goes. Hopefully it is somewhere between 27 and
35 BEFORE, correct?

If you remember the specs of that single vacuum unit dizzy:  Advance/Retard Range: Vacuum: 8.5-11deg Adv _at_ 7.9
In. Hg; Centrifugal: 8-13deg _at_ 1600 rpm, 20.5-24.5 _at_ 3400 rpm
you will see centrifugal advance is 20.5- 24.5 _at_ 3400. Since you are already setting base timing at 7.5
before, you add that to max centrifugal.

Now connect the vacuum line. Run the rpms up to 3400 again. Read the timing mark. It should be about 48
degrees BEFORE TDC, correct?  [ the timing scale ends at 45, 48 is about in the O of VOR]
If yes, the bus should run beautifully.
If no, you need to recheck your vacuum source or see if the vacuum unit is leaking or the advance plate in the
dist is frozen.

Now, for all the others who thinks, &quot;WOW, 48 degrees of advance is going to kill my engine&quot;. Wrong, vacuum
advance goes away at full throttle. All you end up with is 35 max degrees advance. The type 4 engine is
designed for this amount. The 009 at max 30 is limiting your engine output + you loose the power and fuel
economy of the vacuum advance.
