Subject: Bus Trans dilemma...

Hey folks,

I have a dilemma,  see I have a 75 westy with a blown 75 transmission and a
74 1800 pancake with a single Holley dual progressive carb in Bam-Bam and I
want to change the trans but not sure if I should get the 74 0r 75 trans to
match my 74 (1800) pancake.  If any one has any prior experience with this
match or ideas on what year trans would best suit my engine/vehicle any
advice would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you,

Yucel Kuday

75 westy (bam-bam)
