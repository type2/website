&lt;&lt; Sorry but there is no free lunch when you're 17 and need insurance.  When 
I was 17 I had a $250 car and $100/month insurance payments (liability only). 
 Get ready to pay, and pay, and pay.  Sorry...

Welcome to NJ, where you can be any age and still get those rates...All of the
lo-buck insurers you hear on radio or see on your spam, always end with the
line: NOT IN NEW JERSEY !
As to 'cheaper insurance', you might (but you didn't hear it here) consider
registering it somewhere rural near you, even if you hafta 'move' your
license there too... (Shh).
