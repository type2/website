Subject: Re: [T2] clutch question, brain cramp

&gt; When I let the clutch pedal out all the way while the trans.
&gt; is in neutral my Westy jumps forward and the engine dies.  Does
&gt; the cable need to be tightened?  or loosened?

Huh??   The cable adjustment has nothing to do with your Westy jumping in
neutral when you let out the clutch.
Neutral is neutral = no gear engagement at all. If you are jumping you are
still in a gear. Fix your shift linkage so you know what gear you are in!
