Subject: long block wanted in New Zealand

Greetings all
	    My 1600 DP (1973 by the serial number) has sprung valve 
covers downwards which had been carefully put on with new gaskets 
only recently.  Cyl 3 has no compression; and the bolts to hold it 
together are loose!!	The oil filler cap was blown off twice on the 
last warmed-up run.  (Its breather mesh is not clogged.)
	 These signs imply possibly a holed 3 piston, or more likely 
cracked crankcase.
   	In view of how well she cruised in the first thousand-plus 
miles, these facts suggest I might be best to slap in a reco long 
block. I am trying to make this camper my sole 4-wheel motor, and am 
therefore likely to stand the cost of air freight to Auckland.  On 
the other hand, it may well turn out that the freight on the trade-in 
damaged motor isn't justified to N. Amer.  -  i.e. I should sell it 
for parts here, rather than trade it in on the reco long block.  In 
that 'case' we may well do a magnesium bonfire as depicted digitally 
by youse norteamericanos  -  ?New Zealand's first?

	As I'm not sure which listees offer such things for sale, may 
I use the list to inquire about availability &amp; price?  Please respond 
direct to me.


thanx
