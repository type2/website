Subject: Re: [T2] optima battery &quot;blems&quot;?

The battery that I origionally had was an Optimas
battery. This the battery that I melted a hole in the
side of by accident with the ground strap. I took it
back and told them it was bad. They tested and
confrimed my claim. Then they gave me another one.
They guy even put his finger in the melted hole but
didn't say anything. Whether or not they will do this
with yours, I doubt it. I was just having a lucky
streak that day. I think my battery had a 3 year
warrenty. I will just wait another 2 years before I
melt another hole in it. Maybe I will be as lucky. II
agree with George on them tough. They do have good
cranking amps but if your bus does not have any
unknown battery drains and if you run the bus often,
then you really don't need that many. Anyway, that was
my experience.

Have a great day!

&gt; &gt; My neighborhood &quot;FLAPS&quot; has Optima redtop &quot;blems&quot;
&gt; on sale for $70 and $90,
&gt; &gt; depending on CCA.  They come with a 90 day
&gt; warranty.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Anyone know of any risks associated with buying a
&gt; &quot;blem&quot;?  The price seems
&gt; &gt; good!
&gt; 
&gt; A 90 day warranty is horrible!  Any decent battery
&gt; should have at least a
&gt; 5-year warranty.  I've also heard of Optima having
&gt; some rather draconian
&gt; warranty requirements such as sending the bad
&gt; battery back to the
&gt; manufacturer for &quot;inspection&quot; before they will
&gt; authorize a new battery.
&gt; 
&gt; Optimas are good for special applications where you
&gt; need a sealed battery,
&gt; but for a bus you're better off with a conventional
&gt; Pep Boys group 24
&gt; battery in a marine battery box.  No leakage
&gt; problems with the box, and
&gt; the battery is easily servicable and will be
&gt; repplaced under warranty
&gt; without arguement or hassle.
