X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL - A

&lt;&lt; A friend bought a gallon of white reflective RV roof paint ($20).  Cleaned
pretty well (the TSP and scrub brush then the pressure wash) and
rolled it on.  &gt;&gt;

A foam (napless) roller with a very light touch can (with practice!) give re-
sults close to spraying; especially on large flat surfaces. Try using a 6 or
nine inch roller for larger areas and a 2 inch for filling in smaller or 
curved
areas. Check that the paint is compatible with the foam, though, some
solvents will eat the foam. Get the sleeve(s) from a real paint store...
The cheap ones will show &quot;railroad tracks&quot; and tend to tend to delaminate
from the core...
