Subject: Re: Old Tires

I dis agree with both Bill Kennedy and Mike Wright.
Put the bad tires on the rack and get at least good used rubber!

I spun a Toyota 2WD truck into the center wall of westbound Hwy 360 during a
rain storm. Silly me, I thought I'd save a buck or two by not replacing the
rags on the back of the truck. I got caught in one of our semi-decade
downpours. When it rains in the desert it really RAINS! All of a sudden the
rear end flipped out in *front* of me. Hydroplane city! I don't need no new
tires because it NEVER rains in Phoenix. 
Famous last words, I thought as I slid BACKWARDS down about 300 feet of the
center wall with on coming traffic blinking lights and honking at me. What a
helpless feeling trying to perform all of the proper &quot;skid&quot; procedures as
your butt is puckering and time is slowing to a crawl. Somehow, all sound
ceased to exist as well untill the rasping sound of a D A grinder as the
truck ground against the concrete divider. The experience was not due to
&quot;they dont know how to drive in the rain&quot; but in this instance to the
inferior (nearly bald) tires. 
I will never again tempt fate with cheap tires. I advise that others value
their health (and the health of others) enough to do the same. Put the
things on credit or sell furniture before being a tire cheapskate!
