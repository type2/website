Subject: Is anyone collecting the digest posts?

Volks,

I have always been a reader of the interactive version of the list, and 
signed on to the digest version only when I took over administration of 
the list (comforting to see them pop out, y'know).  But... I never 
thought to keep them!  It now turns out I should have for my records, and 
I don't have any :-(  If anyone has a set who would be willing to 
transfer a copy to me, please p-mail me so I can arrange a transfer (fer 
gosh sakes don't send them all at once!!! :-)

                     Thanks!

                     Steve
