&gt; I think I would try a locking gas cap first, and don't hang around while
they
&gt; do the test...

Sorry, by law they are required to remove the cap, inspect the filler neck
for a restricter, AND pressure test the cap.

&gt; what they can't see they may pass you on (I got my hall unit
&gt; OK'd like that - they ck'd the timing, spot on, but didn't pop the dist.
&gt; cap)...

It is NOT illegal to upgrade to electronic ignition. This is one of the few
modifications approved by the Calif. Air Resources Board [CARB].

&gt; Also try a flaps for the insert...

The hammer-it-in-a-steel-fillerneck insert does NOT fit in a VW rubber right
angle filler neck. There is none on the market that will fit....
