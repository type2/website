Subject: Re: [T2] Tire shop apes broke my bus (long)

&lt;&lt; the place I have used recently insists that EVERY tire on every vehicle be
put on with a toque wrench, they wouldn't tighten my tires down until they
checked the spec in my (just so happens to be with me) Bentley
 &gt;&gt;

OTOH, sometimes the liability concerns go too far...My buddy and I went
to a chain store to get a couple of &quot;on special&quot; tires for his trailer...All
we wanted was the tires put on the empty rims, but the clerk said he
&quot;had&quot; to know the make, the model, and the year to make sure the tires
were correct for the car... :-(
