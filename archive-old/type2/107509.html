Subject: Re: [T2] Halloween Van Time - Paint protection

Daniel,
    You asked....
&gt; I was thinking it'd be cool to put halloween pictures on my bus,
like ghosts
&gt; and that sort of thing. But I am wondering what would be the best
thing to
&gt; use, maybe masking tape?? I don't want to damage the paint on my 82,
it's in
&gt; really great shape.

I've used a product called Spraylat on aircraft used in movies.  It's
a thin, plastic, coating that is applied by brush, roller or spary and
can be painted over.  When you are done and want to remove the
temporary paint job the spraylat can be peeled off, taking the colors
with it.  I have no idea what it costs, or where to buy it, but you
can check for the details here
