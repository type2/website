Subject: tie rod ends

hi again,
 i just did my first tie rod and tie rod end removal. all things considered
it went quite well but now i need to adjust the adjustable tie rod end to
correct toe in. the only problem (so for) is that i can not get the nut back
off the right hand thread tie rod end ( until further notice to be known as
tre ). when i put the socket wrench on the nut not only does it turn but so
does the whole bolt and ball joint. anyone have any suggestions?
