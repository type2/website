Sorry, I should have included a little more info in my last post, as several
have pointed out to me. Mountain Creek Is in Pennsylvania, in a town called
Gardners.
Don't bother trying to find it on a map, cause it ain't there! But, it is
close to Gettysburg and another town called Mt. Holly Springs. Also fairly
close to Carlisle.
Hope this clears it up. Even though it may be cold this weekend, it sounds
like it will be fun. If you're within a reasonable distance, try to make it.
Jeff
