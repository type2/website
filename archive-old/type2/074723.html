Subject: Re: [T2] 71 beam to 68

Clark:

Sorry, it will NOT. NO WAY. The physical size is different between the 64-69 and
larger70-79 beams. (It's gotta be in the archives, too, BTW, I've written the
same thing at least 3 times previously.)
You'll need a 68 or 69 axle beam.
Having said that, most all the parts will interchange, but you will not want to
put in both the torsion bars from a 70 or later. They are about 220 lbs heavier
in front and the bars are considerably stiffer. I tried this on my 69 double
cab, but foun them too stiff. I ended up changing back one torsion bar to the
stock type and am very pleased with the performance.

&gt; List,
&gt; I found a lot of information about axle beams in the archives.
&gt;
&gt; What i didn't find was a definitive answer to the question:
&gt; Will a beam from a 1971 bus swap straight to a 1968 bus with no mods(someone
&gt; please say yes and mean it!);p
