Subject: RE: [T2] Re: Mythbusters european car

&gt; Having owned a few Fiats (124 wagon, 850 spider)
&gt; I can understand that Fiat succeeded in keeping oxid-
&gt; ation to just below the level of open flames...;-(


That's how I know POR-15 works. My 124 Spider has seen no rust return in the
areas that I POR-15'd several years ago before getting it repainted.  If
POR-15 can even stop a Fiat from rusting, then it really does work miracles!
