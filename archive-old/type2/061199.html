Just wondering if there are any members (or friends of members) within a
reasonable distance of San Jose who would be interested in doing a small favor
for a listee in Colorado, in exchange for a FREE '82 WESTY!!! (good condition)
No joke! I'll give you the details if interested. E-me directly A.S.A.P. since
I need to get this going soon!
