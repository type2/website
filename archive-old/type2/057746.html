Well maybe '68 to '72.

Need some info quick, like tonight, if someone could please, please go take
a few measurements off their bus.

I'm welding up a tow bar to tow home my new '70 single cab, and just changed
my plan of attack when I realized it should be easier to just bolt to the
bumper bracket mounting holes  on the frame rails after removing the bumper
than what I had initially planned.  Thing is I have only late bays at my
disposal to look at with the other style bumper so I basically need someone
to take 3 quick measurements.  If imagining you are face up under the bus
and staring at 4 bumper mounting bolts.

                  (front of car)

         O    &lt;-------------- A -----------------&gt;   O
         ^                                                        ^
         B                                                       B
         v                                                        v
         O    &lt;-------------- C -----------------&gt;   O

                (rear of car)       O is a bolt head

What are distances A, B, and C, and are the frame rails parallel and
perpendicular to the lines between front and front or rear and rear bolt
holes (which is sort of implied by distances A and C being the same if they
are.  I really need to know this bad, and would love to know if a piece of
3&quot; wide channel could be strung between the bolt holes along the line of
&quot;distance A&quot; (perpendicular to the frame rails, parallel to the bumper)
without hitting anything like pedal assemblies or steering gear and if
anything else would likely obstruct my mounting such a piece of channel.
Bentley claims early tow hooks are welded on, later are bolt on then they
return to weld on with the later bumper.  For a '70 truck anyone know if
mine will be welded or bolted and if they will obstruct my plan?  I assume
this is the same all the way from '68 to '72 until the bumper changed but
don't even know that for sure.

Thanks a lot to anyone who might reply, reply to me directly as the list
doesn't care and as my list mail is dead.
