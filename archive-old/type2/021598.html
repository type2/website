Robert:
Plenty of dogma on both sides. If it really never gets so cold that it won't
warm up in 5 or 6 minutes, I can't see why you'd need the THERMOSTAT. You
still need the flaps to get the flow right.
and don't drive over the mountains where it gets cold.
The engineers designed it that way so you could take your california bus and
move to the wonderful midwest and still have the engine be happy.

&gt; Discussion of Question 2.) Although I generally agree with the idea that
&gt; the original engineers studied this system a lot closer and harder and
&gt; better than anyone else is ever likely to and anything they put on the bus
&gt; must be there for a good reason, I wonder about the value of this
&gt; particular feature in this particular climate.
