Subject: Anyone out there from Boulder?

Is anyone out there in VWland from Boulder, CO?  I just moved up
here and wanted to find out the typical stuff...which repair shops are
good/bad, brewpubs, etc.  I'm sure that with the # of type 2's I've seen
around here that there must be one or two of ya' out there.  Direct e-mail
would be cool to save list bandwidth.  

Joel, change the stats on my '79 bus and '79 westy!  Thanks!
