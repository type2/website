Andy:
That's basically my take on it too, but I think they quit the
reinforcements on the pop-tops about 74 or so. The original
provenance(?) of these parts is shown by their part number (I'm an old 
parts man) which begins 215 (double door panel).
My 78 champagne model had a center cover only (not welded on) mostly,
I'd guess cause it had a BA-6 heater and that kinda guarded it from
damage by tree limbs, etc.
My 58 deluxe sunroof had all 3 panels, though they looked like swiss
cheese from Iowa's snow, salt and humidity.
I'm sure the 69 double cab never had such panels and I don't think I've
ever seen em on single cabs.
