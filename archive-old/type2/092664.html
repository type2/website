&gt;And it has been raining often enough and randomly enough around here that 
&gt;I can't take the bus far without working wipers. Any help would be greatly 
&gt;appreciated.

Verify that the wiper switch is tight. If the lock nut gets loose, the 
switch can turn and one of the electric terminals can short out on the 
dash. Give it a 1/8th turn CCW and tighten the nut.
