This sounds like the same problem I have been having. A high warm idle. I
have replaced most of my vacuum lines and still have this problem. I think I
have tracked it down to a bad decel valve. The decel valve is a round
cannister bolted to the firewall and has three vac hoses connected to it.
One from the brake booster, one molded hose to the intake boot and one goes
to the fuel pressure regulator. In the Bentley, one test is to pinch the
molded hose that runs to the intake boot while it is idling high. If the
idle drops to normal you have a bad decel valve. They are also refered to as
a vacuum limiter.
Unfortunately these are NLA and I have only found one place, RMMW that
stocks them. I called and was told that they are new Bosch units but they
want $119 for them. I found one used from Ken Madson here
http://www.thebusco_dot_com/ . E-mail him your part number to see if he has any
for the '79. Your VW part number should be:
022 133 551C    76-79 auto trans
039 133 551C    79 Calif manual trans
039 133 551B    79 Fed manual trans

That was the quick simple solution on my '78. It could be a vacuum leak
elsewhere though, but sure sounds similar to my problem.

Good Luck

  Upon driving a ways and then
&gt; stopping at a light or whatever, it will then be idling quite high
again --
&gt; and will continue that way at subsequent stops.  Sometimes it seems like
&gt; outside temps have a hand in this, as the idle sometimes eases down to
&gt; normal levels when it is warmer outside.  And sometimes as I sit and
listen
&gt; to it, the idle will go from very high down to slightly high and then back
&gt; up again after a few seconds, and then repeats.
