imho....there are a heck of a lot of things to check and fix before slapping
on an oil cooler.  hope you look into other options first.



original messge:

I remember seeing an oil cooler with an
electric fan and it appears that this may be a good unit - anybody got
one on their van? 
	After all this talk about valve seats I have come to the
conclusion that if your head is cool you probably won't drop a seat. 
Therefore, since my van is a  westy and I may pull a small boat or carry
kayaks on the roof - I've decided to improve the cooling.
