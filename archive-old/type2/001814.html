&gt; Anyone have any &quot;workarounds&quot; for not being able to find a
&gt;clutch alignment tool.  My buddy says he's known a few people who were able
&gt;to line things up w/a screwdriver, but I'm not sure I could intuit my way
&gt;thru' it.

use a deep socket that fits thru the splined hole. i forget how i did it, but seems
you need to reduce the end to the smaller i.d. of the pilot bearing, maybe use
a socket extension and eyeball the fit... a spare trans input shaft is the perfect tool.
a new sachs clutch kit usually includes a plastic tool, also available at local flaps.
