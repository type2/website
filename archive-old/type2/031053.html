&gt;  Dan,  I have a '79 sunroof (project stage) with your same frustrations.  I'm considering converting to sliding cloth sunroof.  Cool retro look.  I have seen some prospective candidates offered at Streat Beat (Phoenix, AZ - advertises in major VW mags), a  &quot;Caribbean Cruiser&quot; from Farmont Skylite, and either a &quot;multi-vent&quot; or &quot;folding roof&quot; from Webasto Sunroofs (should be available from local sunroof installers).

someone locally when I was in college way back in 19mumble mumble had
taken and cut a beetle off just below the windows and welded it over the
sunroof opening.   looked really cool they had a couple capt chairs raised
up in the &quot;dome&quot;

haven't seen anything like it in &quot;a lot of years&quot;
