Subject: Buying a bus

As some of you might know from previous postings, I have been searching (and
searching and searching) for a VW bus.  Since I am just learning, I have
TONS of questions, so here goes again...

I'll be looking at a bus in the New York (Brewster) area soon and its listed
as having a Porsche 914 engine (with a misfire?).  What do I have to be
aware of with the Porsche engine?  Is it harder to work on?  What would
cause the misfire? Is there anyone one in that area who would be willing to
take a look at it with me?  

Thanks for all your help!

Kelly
