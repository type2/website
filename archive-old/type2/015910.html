&gt;David, last year you wrote that oil temp was much more important than 
&gt;CHT. Now you seem to have reversed yourself. What's up?

Nothing, I still feel oil temp is much more important.  Initially I listed
the oil temp gauge (#3) before CHT (#2) but I swapped them when I
remembered that oil pressure (#1 most important gauge IMO) already gives
you a very good indication of oil temperature, since the pressure drops
fairly linearly as the temperature increases.  It was for that reason that
I listed CHT ahead of oil temp.  If for some reason I couldn't have an oil
pressure gauge, then yes I would get oil temp before CHT.  Sorry for the
apparent contradiction.
