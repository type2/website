Subject: Re: lighter questions

I found a regular 'ol replacement lighter at Auto Zone fit right in Itch's
dash. I also installed an in-line fuse (in addition to the fuse panel) so I
would blow the in-line before the fuse panel one.

I've searched the
&gt; archives and found nothing about installation or where
&gt; i can find parts.  Please shed some light on this.
&gt; I'm looking to install one.
