Subject: Gas fumes at 50mph

I have a 72 sportsmobile with a 1600dp in it,I know,not the right
engine.I put new gas lines from the tank to the motor and it seems not
to be leaking gas any where,but when I take it out on the highway and
get it up to 50 I can start smelling gas fumes.The bus is a summer bus
for me and has no heat exchangers,so to help get rid of some of the
fumes I remove the black plastic tube between the riged tube and the
exchanger and filled the end of the riged tube with expanding foam to
seal off fumes from getting to the cab,but I am still getting fumes.Is
there any breathers or over flow tubes I should be checking.Also my gas
gauge only comes to half when the tank is filled up and the gauge is
prone to kind of swing back and forth during turns.thanks
