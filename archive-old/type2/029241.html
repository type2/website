No, it is not. It is some sort of fiberboard. I fyou have any asbestos, it will actually be in the gaskets that connect the heater boxes to the bellows that connect to the metal ductwork in the bus...and also on the metal ductwork end. If you buy new sealing rings (if you can even find new ones), they won't be asbestos.

Personally, I'm not too worried about the asbestos. I ain't crumbling it up and snorting it, and I think there is minimal chance that it's doing me any real harm. Go ahead, flame me. I'm wearing cotton. :) Joe
