Subject: Re: [T2] thermostat

You can use a thermostat for a type-1 engine with a little modification for
your type-4. Check out www.aircooled_dot_net here

http://www.aircooled_dot_net./new-bin/viewproductdetail.php?keyword2=ESM0002&amp;cartid=

 and on the drop down choose the selection for the type-1 80-85 degrees and
they explain how to do it. It is important that you get the 80-85 degree
t-stat. I got mine from Bus Depot a couple of months ago but it looks like
they may be out of them now.
