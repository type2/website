&gt; OK - next question - what are the best new heads to
 get (which manufacturer?), and where's the best place
 to get them (quickly)?

Again, Ron feels good about the heads he sells. They are here:

http://busdepot_dot_com/view.jsp?model=57&amp;category=15&amp;group=9&amp;prodgroup=61

If you need an expedited order you should call the 800 number and talk
to Ron personally. Tell him you are on Type2_dot_com and you will get a
discount.

&gt; I'm assuming it's OK to renew just one side - I
 wouldn't need to do both, would I (no added wear on
 the engine from new heads one side, older on the
 other)?

It's a matter of personal preference. If the other side is up to spec,
you might continue to run it. Some people change heads at 50,000 miles
anyway as preventative maintenance. You're over half way there anyway.
But I try to get as much mileage as I can out of components due to
financial reasons. It depends on how much you want to spend, plus you
are on a limited time schedule. If you pull the engine, two heads
don't take that much longer to change than one.

&gt; How would you compare this, time-and-effort-wise, to
 dropping the engine? I'd much rather leave it in the
 vehicle like yuyouaid, but have always read that
 you're better off just to bite the bullet. I dropped
 the engine on my own last time, and don't want to do
 it again any time soon :-)

Again, it is personal preference. Like you, my first engine install
was an ordeal. After doing several it has become faster. Changing
heads is one procedure. Dropping engine is another. When short on
time, I go to the heart of the matter and avoid unnecessary steps. If
you decide not to drop, be sure to remove or loosen the tin at the
firewall so the cylinder cover tin will come off.
