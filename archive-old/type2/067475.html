Subject: please stop the politcal bs

&gt; You can do your part to help the losers and winners of
&gt;political races by assisting in the cleanup of the painted plywood
&gt;and 2x4 signs and plastic cardboard for proper re-use or recycling.

hmmm..yeah...okay...they trash the roads with their stuff and i'm supposed
to pick it up? can i bill them for it like the gov't does?

&gt;I would rather you vote against me than not vote at all.
&gt;Get out and VOTE on November 5th (USA folks that is !)

enough preaching about voting. there isn't anyone who i agree with. not old
man dole and his right wing agenda. not slick willy with his scandals and
wimpy administration. certainly not perot. it's my duty/right to vote but it's
also my duty/right not to vote if no candidate represents what i believe in.

besides, we aren't electing a president anyways. we are electing the electoral
votes...then they vote. of course, they don't have to vote the way they are
supposed to. so in effect, we aren't really voting democratically.

let's stick to vws. they can't lie to you. they can't steal from you. they
work hard and as long as you take care of them, will keep on working hard.
