&gt; Another cheaper alternative, is to buy a 6 inch nipple from your
&gt; FLP(lumbing)S, screw it in the block and put the oil pressure sender on
&gt; the top of it.  The thread for the oil pressure sender is tapered 1/8&quot;
&gt; NPT (National Pipe Thread).  The nipple needs to be at least 6 inches
&gt; long such that the sender towers above the engine and does not interfere
&gt; with the distributor.  I did this about two weeks ago and it works
&gt; great.

another way is to use a shorter piece of pipe, which I got from my FLAPS
about 3 inches with a 90 degree turn and seal it with teflon tape. this
puts the sender beside the distributor and has worked fine for well over a
year with no vibration and no leaks.  it's a tight fit but it will fit.
