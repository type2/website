Yes, tempered glass is remarkable stuff.  It is super-strong unless you
scratch it deeply or stress it at a single point, then it turns into
kibbles.

&gt; I did my first window install with an old mechanic at an car restoration
&gt; shop and it was SO easy. Of course then there was the '57 Beetle that got 6
&gt; new windshields b/c they kept breaking them (body was tweaked).

Windshields are not tempered and are a lot more fragile than the other
windows.
