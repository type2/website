  person ?

Hi Lee,

You have to be careful with Escrow, there are scammers out there.  
This site has a great story about a scammer who got hosed by a  
careful buyer:

&gt; that seems to be the best way, but to be honest if the seller  
&gt; hasn't heard of Escrow then its reputation is kind of zero by  
&gt; default (I know it's not really).  Any other suggestions ?
