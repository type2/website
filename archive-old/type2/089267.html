Subject: Re: [T2] AIRS--Road Trippers need help in Boise

http://www.bowwowautoparts_dot_com/ Bow Wow Auto Parts, Boise, ID.
bowwowautopartsi_at_qwest_dot_net  Their email addy.
208-345-6451    Their telephone number
4722 Emerald St, Boise ID 83706  Their address

Make sure they get what they need at their first opportunity, becuase VW
parts places is few and far between out there. Jan B
There is also a HUGE junkyard west of Couer d'Alene, near Walla Walla,
Washington. It's plainly visible for a long stretch along the main Hwy 90.
If they need something arranged ahead of time in the way of a used part,
they can email Jim at vegjam_at_aol_dot_com. He deals mainly in used cars, but
sometimes he does parts. He could probably get it set up for them. Jan B

&gt; Two young men from WA state who are doing a tour of the west are in need
of a VW part source/junkyard.  They
&gt; stopped by Vegas and crashed with my family for a couple of days.  They
are between Salt Lake City and Boise now
&gt; and they are having some problems with their linkage.
 They were pretty sure they would make it
&gt; to Boise and a friend's house.  However, they would like to repair it
before heading back to Washington.
