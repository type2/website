&gt; The only Bay Window toys I have are N scale (1:160) vehicles that I found

yeah, I would much prefer 1:48 or larger.

I do model building but the cost per unit is prohibitive.  figure $75+
each

one reason I don't do any molding for a full size bus either.  it takes
high (very high in the thousands) volumne to be able to do anything
inexpensively.
