Subject: Re:&quot;Shore Power&quot; and Techno In Bus

Well, thank you all for the advice and technology details !
Its awesome to read (and see in some cases) what technology everyone 
has crammed in their buses, be it drills or tvs.
I was a bit lost starting the project but I have a good handle on what 
is required now and I am underway !

Mike Benthin's bus is CHOCK full of mods, his web page is great 
(http://www.geocities_dot_com/mike_benthin), I think I will try and 
document my work on my bus (Techno and Mechanical) in a similar fashion.
It would be kind of nice to be able to share things so anyone else can 
save themselves some time and headaches.

Got alot done this week, there are ALOT of places to hide things in a 
73 Hightop ! &lt;grin&gt;
I wont bore everyone with the details, but I will post a link to my 
webpage when she is all done.

Thanks again for all the tips !

Steve
