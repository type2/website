Subject: I got the VW letter too, but.....

I see it a little differently, perhaps.   
    I think maybe they got a little &quot;awakened&quot; by the fact that the show this 
year is no longer being held on VWoA grounds;  also that last year was the 
very large petition drive sponsored by the Michigan club, which explained how 
we all felt we were being treated; and finally the emails and letters they 
have gotten from people like myself- I explained to them that because of all 
the foolishness that was happening, that our new van that was going to be a 
Eurovan became an Odyssey instead. I also let them know in pretty plain 
english that I will NEVER look at another new VW again. 
  

    Maybe the light went on somewhere that in the long run, this was creating 
some very bad karma (duh) and the pencil pushers woke up?    Or, maybe not.   
    As was stated earlier, I guess time will tell......
   Just my 2 cents, your opinions will of course vary.....
