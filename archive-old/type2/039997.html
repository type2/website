One funny moment: I have to work on the street, and I was out there
substantially under my bus with my sandalled feet sticking out the back.
There's a high school just up the street and some of the students were
walking by. I heard some guy go, &quot;It's a lady!&quot; Must've noticed my
painted toenails....

P.S. I get a lot of that.
