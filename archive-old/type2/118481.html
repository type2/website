Subject: Re: [T2] 2000cc engine would turn over??

Any chance all that turning over, getting fuel but no spark, filled up one
or more cylinders with gasoline?  Pull all the plugs and try turning it over
again.  Absent that, it could be a separated valve head.  They can break off
without making all kinds of expen$ive noise.

The history of folks using easy-outs is a mixed bag, at best.  You don't
want to screw up on the crank.  The best way to do this is to drill *dead
center* with a succession of larger drills, preferably left-hand drills,
until you've just about got all the bolt gone, then reach for the easy-out.
But, unless you've got all the equipment to do exactly that, you'll have to
spend big bucks to buy left-hand drills and the proper sized easy-out;
probably better to take it to a machinist who will remove it for you.

The bolts on a TypeIV engine are M10.

&gt; Ok - I'm a dumb A**!  The engine on a vw bus that I just purchased doesn't
run.  for a while, while I was trying to find out what was wrong with it it
turned over fine.  It had good compression in all the cyclinders and it was
geting fuel but it would not even spudder.  I check the timing the best I
could, it seemed ok.  Then all of a sudden it stopped turning over?
Something was binding.  I turned the enngine over be hand in the opposite
direction.  It did turn a half of revolutiong than stopped again.  Then I
had a bright idea, not really, I use a socket and a large breaker bar on the
stud that is in the middle of the crank shaft....YUP you guessed it it
turned over a half revolution, hit the binding spot and snapped the head of
the bolt off....I know like I started this email, I'm a dumb A**!!  Since
then I've pulled the engine and I'm preparing to find out what went wrong.
But before I start i have a couple of question.
&gt; 1. how the heck do I get the bolt out of the crank?? will an easy-out
work?
&gt; 2. any suggestion on what may be wrong with the engine??
&gt; 3. I have to buy some bolts to put the engine in a stand, do you know what
size I need??
&gt; --Please help--spring is coming and I hope to be on the road by
then....Thanks in advance..
