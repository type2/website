Subject: Rust on cylinder tops

There's rust on the tops of my cylinder fins, but not much on the sides 
and none on the bottom. Trying to figure out why this would be so. The 
best I can come up with is that when the engine is shut off, moisture 
in the air condenses on the bottom side of the top tin, then rains down 
on the fins. It could be that convection keeps moving air through the 
cylinders for a while as they cool, increasing the condensation on the 
tin.

I've seen all-rusty cylinders, and I've seen oil-fouled cylinders. But 
never this funny pattern. Maybe it's common.

Mark
