Subject: engine rebuild

Hello all
I have a question.......Ive got a 71 standard sunroof
van that is all stock........im going to have it sent
off to the body shop for sheet metal work and in the
mean time id like to overhaul the engine while its
gone.
now ive found a good deal on a stock engine over haul
kit but they are asking to &quot;specify main bearing size
and thrust measurements when ordering&quot; How would i go
about finding out that info?
This is my first rebuild for a vw and im looking
forward to it..............
would this be a good kit also? ANY  feed back on this
would be so appreciated
