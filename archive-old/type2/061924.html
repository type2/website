Subject: Re: List Vultures/Grumpiness and the List

I'd side with Ron on this one. 

I have expressed displeasure with vendors, specific cirumstances, and on
occasion the position of the sun in the sky depending on my mood. What I try
very hard to do is to make my point(s) without personally defaming
individuals, organizations, or planets by name. 

By doing this I free myself from potential liability suits and hopefully
come across with a little class. I remember a little situation which popped
up on one of the lists in which someone found it necessary to sell their
beloved vehicle in order to make amends to another and pay for a lawyer's
time. (Yes, I remember the list and the individuals involved but don't find
it necessary to dredge up names. It's an old issue which is now closed). The
injection of attempted humor/humour also, hopefully shows the list that I
recognize the relavence of my point to life in general.

I certianlly pray that this list does not lower itself to arguing about
&quot;Bimbos and Whale-tails.&quot; Some of you may folow my drift.
