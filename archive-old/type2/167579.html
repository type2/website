&gt; The table jack (lift) is a flat metal tough-as-nails table, so it's uses are

have a flat plate that fits on top when not lifting motors or trannies

&gt; When I'm not messing around with bus motors and trannys, I use the table
&gt; lift for all kinds of shop duties. I call it my Swiss-army table (but I
&gt; already lost the tweezers and toothpick).

I use this thing for everything and it is easier to manuver around and get
under, you can work under the engine to when it is raised.

to each his own I guess.
