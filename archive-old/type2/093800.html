Subject: 1976 - 1600cc Cuts out at idle

------_=_NextPart_001_01C21090.818B4BC0

Hi, 
I am newbie to owning a camper, and to this list, so apoligies in advance i=
f
I am asking a silly or well covered question.
 
I have just bought a 1976 camper, which was cutting out constantly at low
revs.
 
I suspected a grotty earth connection from the battery the body, so I
replaced the lead and cleaned up the connections, and replaced the battery
at the same time..
 
This seemed to fix the problem and the idle was pretty good, but it still
occasionally cuts out.. any ideas?
I checked the distributor cap, points, coil HT &amp; LT, all seems good, the
plugs are good too.
 
I am tempted to think its electrical but don't know if this is a 'common'
problem?
 
Any ideas gratefully received - cheers
Andi
