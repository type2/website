Subject: [RE] finding TDC

THANKS people! the picture from Peter is exactly what I was looking for. but 
if I am remembering correctly there is a domed cap in the center of the 
pulley and I will check tomorrow to see if it is something that just pops 
off. I hadnt considered using a dowel to check for piston travel. easiest 
answers often evade me heh. I can fall back on that to verify too. That info 
saves my bus so a big HI5 to all! I couldnt believe when I bought a 78 bus 
for my son that the seller also offered me his 72 westy for 300 jsut because 
he couldnt get any power out of the engine after replacing the distributor 
and plug wires. As long as it is a running vehicle the folks will let me 
keep it at their house to restore (which all it needs is the engine running, 
the sheet metal on this thing is in insanely good condition).



&quot;What signify a few lives lost in a century or two?  The tree
of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of
patriots and tyrants.  It is its natural manure.&quot;

-- Thomas Jefferson (letter to William Stephens Smith, 1787)
