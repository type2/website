Subject: Gas In My Oil (was &quot;Strange Oil Level&quot;)

Hello Again All -
Well, it looks as though my mysteriously-high oil level was actually due to
the presence of mucho gasoline in my oil.  (Thanks to all of you who
overwhelmingly suggested this....it never occurred to me.)  I did a smell
test, comparing some older used oil I had lying around with the oil I just
removed from my engine -- although I couldn't detect much of a difference,
I had someone else take a whiff and tell me it totally smelled like gas; it
also seemed thinner.  Damn.  This gas-in-the-oil thing is a totally new one
for me, and I'm hoping someone can please explain to me what is possibly
going on here:  (1) What are the likely cause[s] that would allow gasoline
to seep into the crankcase and mix with the oil? This seems VERY sudden, as
in materializing only in the approx. 150 miles since I last changed the oil
- before that the oil stayed at a pretty constant level below the full
line.  (2) Is there anything I can easily/visibly check for without exotic
tools &amp; measuring devices that might help shed some light on the situation
- and is it possible that I could even fix it if lucky [in other words,
could there be a simple explanation]?  (3) Have I possibly done any damage
to my engine by running it in this condition?  I haven't been smelling any
excess gas lately, and it's been running as good as ever (it has always run
a little rough to begin with until eventually smoothing out when warm - no
changes there) - nothing seems different.  By the way, I have a 1979 bus
with a 2.0L engine and FI - if I need to provide additional information,
please let me know &amp; I'll be glad to.  Thanks very much for any insight and
help you can provide!
