If the waterboxer engine is equipped with Bosch Digifant fuel injection, it 
might be a good idea to salvage the knock sensors.

At sometime in the future, I hope to develop an instrumentation system to 
detect and warn of engine detonation (i.e. spark knock, pinking or pinging), 
of which there is a profound danger, in modified air-cooled engines or those 
running on low octane petrol.
