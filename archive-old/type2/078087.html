Subject: Re: [T2] Paint question...



&gt;IMPHO, use nothing courser than 80 grit paper to strip anything------
&gt;
&gt;Use 60 grit, and you had better buy stock in the primer company your
&gt;going to be using, as you will be doing allot of filling using that
&gt;60---big gouges in the metal.
&gt;
&gt;80---prime
&gt;180---prime
&gt;320---paint

I would agree UNLESS you are painting the vehicles I have worked on which 
had half a dozen paint jobs already! But Terry is right - when you get 
close to where you want to be sanding wise, better move down a notch to a 
finer grit or you will indeed be spraying a BUNCH of primer to fill those 
scratches.

I had a chance to use the high-build primer that several of the paint 
manufacturers offer and they are wonderful for building a scratched and 
bruised car body back to straight. Whole milk (maybe even like cream?) 
versus skim milk.
