Subject: Re: Replacement for egr bolt blue out

Tom :
you might consider tapping the next larger
bolt size, something like 7/16 (original is 10 mm X 1.0 MM).
as you know , the hole is in the exhaust port past the valve, and
if done with that valve shut, any tapping residue will drop into
the exhaust stream and blow out when the engine is started.
