Hm, this reminds me...

Does it matter what order you adjust the valves in, on both solid and
hydraulic?  Someone said something to me about turning the pulley
counterclockwise whilst doing the adjustments - necessary?  What happens
if you move it the other way?

AND - just replaced my lifters ('79) - when bled (yes, apparently you
must disassemble the new lifters and reassemble them submerged or...???)
should you be unable to depress them manually?  This is the case with
mine.  Only 2 of the old lifters have any appreciable movement...

Thanks!
