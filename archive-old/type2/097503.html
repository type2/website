&gt; &gt; Hello Type 2 Fans:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Anyone have any good suggestions for cleaning the top on my 75 Poptop?
&gt; &gt; It's generally looking kinda drab and is pretty dirty.  What works
&gt; &gt; best for bringing it back to a fresh white look? Is re-painting
&gt; &gt; recomended?

I used X-14 (available most everywhere as a standard mildew cleaner in a
spray bottle like 409).
Perfect job. It took 20 minutes with a scotch brite pad and mild elbow
grease. Clean as a new
penny....
