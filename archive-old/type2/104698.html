Subject: Things that DON'T WORK

The Coleman &quot;Sport Cat&quot; puts out about 1000 BTU and is way too undersized to
even marginally heat the rear interior of a Vanagon Westy with the top down.

I recently took a little trip to the east coast and discovered this through
trial and error. Cabin temp was 36 F on the way up after 4-5 hours of
sleeping with the heater running and 46 F on the return trip sleep over...

So, I suggest getting a heater with at least 3000 BTU heating capacity if
you want to be comfortable in cold weather bus camping. (Coleman Black Cat _at_
$50)

And, YES I was running a Carbon Monoxide alarm while I was sleeping. And,
YES the bus heat, while the engine was running, had interior cabin
temperatures up to 80 degrees (more than enough capacity, had to turn the
heat down).
