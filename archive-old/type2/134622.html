Subject: Re: [T2] Rebuilt Rngines  

One thing I would recommend from Kragen or Harbor Freight is the $59 ATV 
jack as pictured in Richard's engine swap photo shoot on his web site.

By the way, I never did say how much I liked the A- bomb / tranny ride ;-)

-----------------------

&gt;Second unrelated question:  Engine rebuilds and R&amp;R's (remove and
&gt;replace).  Ot erh than Muir, is there something in the archives of a
&gt;list of what I could buy today at my local FLAPS (ie Kragen/Checker/Pep
&gt;BOys) to be ready for this job?

Very little these days. In fact less and less as each day goes by. I'd stick 
with the online vendors that support the list.
