Subject: vapour lock ? what to do?

After taking a break during an 800 Km trip during the summer
months (it's summer here down under in Oz) I experienced what i
was told was a vapour lock, the Kombi wouldn't start I didn't
know what to do.After letting it sit for an hour or so ( did
lunch) came back and it started.

What is a vapour lock and what can be done to fix or stop it frim
happening?

Thanks mani
