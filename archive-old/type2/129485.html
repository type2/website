Hi Volks!

Friday topic ...

&gt; &gt; But sticking a peace sign on a stripped EV would

&gt; 
&gt; My local VW dealer tried this on some $32,000
&gt; base EV's (before the price slash).  Didn't work.
&gt; They ended up trading the vans to other dealers.

The Eurovan wouldn't work as a Microbus-whatever anyway.
They're all around here, and they're so boring.  Good
vans, yes, market leaders too, but ... *yawn*.

&gt; &gt; 1.8 IIRC?  5-speed tranny, MacPhereson struts,
&gt; &gt; and steel 15&quot; wheels would be a cheap vehicle.

Eurovan-based, Polish-made T5 Transporter.  As can be
found by the dozen in any German VW dealership.  About
as appealing as a forklift.

&gt; &gt; Dodge has done this with the Sprinter
&gt; &gt; (Mercedes). However... The Sprinter is still
&gt; &gt; REALLY expensive - Empty LWB Sprinter van is
&gt; &gt; still in the high $20K range...
&gt; 
&gt; IF I were going to spend $25-35k on a van, this
&gt; would probably be it, mostly because of that
&gt; SWEET 5 cyl diesel.  But it's still a little too
&gt; much van and is equipped and marketed as a
&gt; cheaper-to-operate replacement for a Ford E350
&gt; cargo van.  

Which is what it is.  The Sprinter/LT is even more
ulitarian and boring than the T5.  And also much, much
bigger.  Not really what I'd want to make a Microbus
out of.

&gt; Maybe when the next Caravan, which is
&gt; rumored to be a Mercedes Vito and will be
&gt; available with a small CDI diesel, will finally
&gt; hit the spot.

Did you see the new Vito?  *shudder*  There's a new
definition of ugliness.  Begins with a V, ends with
an o.

&gt; &gt; VW hasn't given up on the idea of a new
&gt; &gt; Microbus, they are just rethinking the process.
&gt; &gt; Version 2 of the NEW Microbus is being based
&gt; &gt; on a U S approved platform,
&gt; 
&gt; I can't imagine what platform that would be.

Wild guess: Next Passat.  Transversal engine, lots
of wheelbase and width, mass produced and hence not
too expensive.  I wouldn't be surprised at all if
that's going to be the foundation for the next Sharan,
and also for a version with altered design that's
going to be the Microbus.  But I repeat, this is a
wild guess.

&gt; Toureg?  My money is on this.  I wouldn't be
&gt; surprised to see some Pacifica looking extra long
&gt; Toureg based &quot;crossover utility vehicle.&quot;
&gt; Nothing is a van or wagon any more.  And &quot;utility
&gt; vehicles&quot; don't have much utility.

Hm.  Let's hope you're wrong then.  The Touareg isn't
all that spacious inside, it's only big from the outside.
(Like most SUVs in fact.)

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
