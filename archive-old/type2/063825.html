Subject: ISO front turn signals lenses

Anyone know of a good aftermarket source for front turn signals for the early
breadloafs?  These are the ones that are down in front just above the bumper
(with exception of &quot;newbie '71&quot; post).  I've got a West Coast Metric catalog
but it doesn't look like they offer these parts.

Also, how about the cab section rubber floor mat?  Has anyone located a good
quality aftermarket mat?  I know they offer one for the '67s and earlier.
