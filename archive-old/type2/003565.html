Sean quoth:

&gt;computer for full enrichment.  There is no throttle angle sensor
&gt;however, our systems are a bit primitive for that.


Actually the L-Jetronic is an advancement on the D-jet in the fact that it
did away with the throttle position sensor, so sayeth the Bosch book,
apparently they felt the mass air sensing L-jet system did not need it
whereas apparently the more arcane D-jet sensing manifold vacuum/pressure
(not that accurately in 1970 I guess) needed the additional throttle sensor.
It is further interesting to note Bosch then further reverted in the
K/KE-jet days to basically a very reliable mechanical system based on their
first systems of the 50's and 60's.  (I've seen a KE-jet rabbit retrofit
onto an air cooled vanagon, ran very nicely, so damn reliable it gets
amazing)  Then to top it all off went back to individual pulsed injectors,
and finally in a bit of stupidity as it ended up on my venerable G-60
corrado thought once again they could do it all based on manifold pressure
and need not even a mass air or throttle sensor.  Which proves absolutely
nothing, the more things change....

The more I wish I had a single 30-PICT

What the hell did this thread start on anyway?
