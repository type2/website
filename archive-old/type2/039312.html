Subject: Re: AIRS UPDATE

I also want to add that AIRS is not just for roadside emergencies. Some
of us who are less technically capable can still offer coffee/beer,
camping, conversation, and hot showers. And a friendly face in a strange place.

Anyone who comes to L.A., gimme a call! We'll go junkyarding.... :-)
