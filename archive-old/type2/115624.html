&gt; On both sides at the very bottom of my case the

That's the part number for the case.

&gt; also at the top center of the fanhousing side of my case are the
&gt; numbers &quot;CA 015 693 XG&quot; I think this inscription might be from the very
&gt; terrible GEX rebuilders but at this point I have no idea. Can anyone help
&gt; me out?

See:

Is that number printed here?

Assuming that the engine has stock parts, if you look inside the valve
cover, under the rocker arm you will see a part number for the head. This
will give you an idea of the displacement. Compare the numbers to this
chart:

Might as well check both heads while you are at it. I know of at least one
person with a 2L engine who had one 1.7L head and it was a huge surprise to
him. The 8mm valve adjustment screws was his first tip-off.
