Subject: Gasket under Icebox in '72

I am making a new gasket for my drain etc. in my 72. Mine has disappeared
and I think the picture in Bentley is different.

Could someone please look under their Westy and find out these 2 things

Is the gasket bigger than the bracket that holds it or the same size?

The bracket has 2 flanges along the short ends ..I assume that these go up
and the gasket compresses between it and the bottom of the floor. Right?


Thanks you much.
