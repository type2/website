Subject: Re: [T2] RE: Brake Booster Removal

If there was brake fluid in the booster itself then it got there via
bypassing the main rear seal of the master cylinder.  If the MC was changed
and the booster was not checked, not as thorough a mechanic as I prefer.  If
the MC was not changed, it's due.

FWIW,
Bill

&gt;
&gt; Mine had brake fluid in it.
&gt;
&gt; Maybe 1/4 cup.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Rinsed it twice with a bottle of alcohol each
&gt; time.  Shook it out let it dry over night...hope it works fine&lt;grin&gt;.
&gt;
&gt; If it worked with the brake fluid in it, I suspect it would work just fine
&gt; without it also.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers, dave

&gt; &gt; &gt;Can I safely remove this thing and put it back the way I found it,
without
&gt; &gt; &gt;doing that? Any advice?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Yes. While it's out check to see that it doesn't contain brake fluid.
