Subject: so long for now

List: 
As a result of increased professional and personal obligations, and
planned changing ISP's, I am leaving the list for a while. 
I want to thank you all for the fun and wisdom  I've gained in the last
13 months. Also, I've increased my typing and composition skills greatly
at your expense!
Especially, I'd like to thank the list administrators for keeping us
between the white lines!
I'll still look in from time to time from the web pages and I'm sure
sometime I'll have to jump back onto the list.
I'll be at this address for a couple more weeks if any of you need to
get  a hold of me about the parts for sale or get a hold of me for other
stuff.
VW type 2's are the best and so are you list members!
Have a nice holiday- I'm outta here!
