Subject: Wireing an Electric fuel pump
Message-ID: &lt;7k8usi$skd5_at_eGroups_dot_com&gt;

Well, I've searched the archives and tech pages and didn't find an answer to my question
 even though I remember reading some posts about it a while back.  I am putting a Facet
 electric fuel pump in my 72 because that seems to be the best pump for my Dellorotos.
  The Wiring diagram that came with the pump has been photo copied too many times and is
 practically unreadable.  Can anyone describe to me the right way to wire it in, so that it
 quits pumping when the engine stops turning.
