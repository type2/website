Subject: I'm running out of ideas was Re: ...still won't idle cold

&gt; Wil,
&gt; I agree that the auxiliary air valve and most notably its air supply
&gt; hose is the number one suspect. If there is any leak that allows
&gt; tramp air between the outlet of the AFM and the auxiliary air valve
&gt; input, then when the air valve is doing its job (allowing additional
&gt; air input to the manifold) it is doing so in a manner that this
&gt; additional air is not properly sensed by the AFM, so the control
&gt; unit doesn't compensate with additional gas, and the mixture that
&gt; gets to the combustion chamber is too lean; therefore no idle. So
&gt; check both ends of the hose that supplies the air valve, and the
&gt; hose itself for a crack.

I took off the aux air valve and &quot;Gumout&quot;ed it today.  It was dirty
inside but seemed to move freely....more freely after the gumout.
I can't find my ohm meter at the moment to check the resistance yet.

The hose has clamps on both ends and doesn't seem to be the issue.  I
did realize the nylon &quot;Y&quot; it goes to into the &quot;S&quot; intake hose has a
rib that should get pressed into a valley in the opening in the &quot;S&quot;
hose so I got that in.

...so with that I tried it but with no improvement.

I pulled the accelerator cable through its fitting enough to keep the
thing running without having to keep my foot on the pedal after
starting it...(spits and pops from wrong mixture but runs) and I hear
a whooshing sound....no obvious vacuum leaks but the sound seems to be
coming from the &quot;diaphragm&quot; looking thing that hangs off the front
wall of the engine compartment near center but on the driver's side.
Two larger hoses come off this...one to the other port of the &quot;Y&quot; to
the &quot;S&quot; hose after the AFM, the other to a connection nearer the back
of the air distributor.  There is a smaller vacuum hose on the other
side of this going to the fuel pressure regulator.

I'm wondering what this does and if it could be the problem.

&gt; Also the L-shaped rubber boot at the bottom tears...

Yeah, its torn but there is enough of it to get the hose clamp on it
above the tear.

thanks.
