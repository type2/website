    My moneys on 1970, still has wide 5 hubcaps, '70 was last year, chrome 
hubcaps were an option. The side marker is rectangle and on the door, '69 is 
round and on the dogleg. One of my books states that VW offered as an option 
a 1.7 litre engine in the second year which gave a max speed of almost 80mph.
