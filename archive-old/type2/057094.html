Subject: RE:  Size for Total Seal rings

&gt;When asked what size, I replied, &quot;90.5&quot; and was told that was 
&gt;not enough info to place an order.   I asked what other sizes 
&gt;were needed and the fellow said that I should measure the pistons!  

My brand-new Mahle &quot;90.5&quot; pistons have 90.43 stamped on the crowns.
Perhaps this is what they need?  Other than than, the only thing I can
think of would be the thickness of the gaps, but it seems like those
should be fairly standard?

Let us know what you discover!!
