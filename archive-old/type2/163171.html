Subject: Interesting oil leak, what do you think?

My Westy when bought, had no thermostat on it, so I dutifully put the thermostat and essentials back on and it is working great. Before putting it back on I would have about 1-2 drips of oil overnight that would end up the size of a silver dollar, that was all. This was if it was pointed downhill at such an angle that the front wheels would be about 6&quot; lower than the back wheels. Now that I've put the thermostat and stuff back on, the leak is about 6&quot; across by the next morning, after bleeding into the concrete. My thought is that now the engine is reaching it's proper temp, the oil is thinning out and dripping more freely. Would appreciate your thoughts on:
1) Any thoughts on what is leaking? the PR tubes appear dry, and it leaks when nose down mostly.
2) Are my thoughts on the oil temp creating a bigger leak valid?

Thanks,
Courtney
