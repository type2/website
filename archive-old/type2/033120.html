Subject: Bus Tour Update - Nov 26, 1999 - Georgia

Today we picked up the hub cap and case from Skip
Correll and his wife.  We then met up with Chris Huff
and friends this evening at the Varsity (in Kennesaw,
not the downtown one) and passed everything on.

We had 3 Buses lined up outside the restaurant
while we ate inside - hopefully it provided a little
visual treat for all those holiday shoppers cruising
by.
