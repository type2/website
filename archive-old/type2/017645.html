Subject: wizzo on bell housing
Message-ID: &lt;3711049E.5630_at_penn_dot_com&gt;

Hello Volks,

In the process of installing all the old stuff on a new AVP long block
engine for my 1978 Westy I came across puzzle.

On the right top side of the bell housing is an item I can not identify.
It is disc-shaped on the flywheel side and extends through the casting
into the motor compartment where it has a rubber cover with a wire
extending through it.  This wire goes to the rear of the motor where it
connects to nothing.  

Questions:
1. What is it?
2. What does it do?  Hall effect pickup?  For what? Engine diagnostics?
3. How do I get it out? Should I just chuck it?

Thanks and more questions are sure to follow.

Drew
