You can quickly and easily order the book (and about a million
others) from www.amazon_dot_com.  I just looked it up by entering the
search page and then &quot;Wilson, Tom&quot; and &quot;Volkswagen.&quot;

Here's what I found:  

How to Rebuild Your Volkswagen Air-Cooled Engine
by _Tom Wilson_

Paperback
List:$15.95 --Amazon_dot_comPrice:$14.35 --YouSave:$1.60(10%)

Published by Hp Books

Every time I've used them, the books have shown up in my mail
within a couple of days, although they say it should take a couple
of days longer.

Happy Rebuilding!
Dennis
P.S.  While I was there, I wrote a quick review:
_dennis_at_cpac.washington_dot_edu_, 09/18/96, rating=9:
The definitive guide to rebuilding your air-cooled VW engine.
Unlike the other two canonical manuals for air-cooled VWs (The
official Bentley Shop Manual and the John Muir Compleat Idiot
Guide), this one focuses on removing, rebuilding, and
reinstalling the engine. It describes rebuilding procedures more
clearly and in more detail, and feels more &quot;current&quot; than the
other manuals. If you are contemplating a rebuild of your bug,
bus, early vanagon, porsche 914, squareback or other air-cooled
VW engine, this inexpensive manual will easily pay for itself by
reducing the amount of time you spend puzzling over procedures
and improving your chances for a successful, high-quality
rebuild. The only complaint I have is that color pictures would
be nice, but would undoubtedly raise the price.
