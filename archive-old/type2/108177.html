Subject: What are these things?

So I was working on my 60 in the backyard the other day and I also had my 78
there giving it a wash and wax.  The next day I found this kinda wire thing -
I don't recognise it as being from my bus .... but I have no explanation as to
why it would be in my back yard.  Does anyone recognize this wire thing.

I also found this grommet in my 78 when I got it - anyone recognize it? Part
Number 211 129 690

TIA
jdd 60 std, 78 westy
