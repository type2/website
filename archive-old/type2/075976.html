Subject: Re: [T2] solid/hydraulic swap?

Welcome to the never ending link.
#1. Solid lifters on hydraulic cams, hydraulic lifters on solid cams.
#2. Oil temperature.
#3. Oil pressure.
#4. Valve size.
#5. Compression ratios.
Then there are those of us sit quietly and read all of the disputes...
our end conclusion is confusion.
Somebody will luck out and still have a good engine with obscure
configurations and mis matched parts but most other won't. 
Most people that assemble an engine with junk parts come out with the
knowledge that they should have spent the extra time and money and done
it right.
Congratulations to all of those who can keep a junk engine running for so
long as to brag about it.

Getting back to the root of the conversation, if you change 
lifters you must  change cams, no matter what the profiles. The hardness
of each 
must match or you WILL have troubles.
