Subject: RE: tire SIPING

&gt; &gt;the guy is telling me about this new process they have called &quot;SIPING&quot; 
&gt; &gt;as in they want to SIPE your tires, $10 per tire. sipe is apparently
&gt; the 
&gt; &gt;name of the guy who came up with the process. there's a special 
&gt; &gt;machine that does it, and what they do is run your tire through the 
&gt; &gt;machine, and it cuts some very fine diagonal lines through the tread, 
&gt; 
	[Bill Crick-&gt;]  Not new. I can remember seein ghtis for bus, and
truck tires at least 20 years ago.
