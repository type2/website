Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Tan,  really a Fri but time sensitive

really great ad in todays (8 OCT) New York Times newspaper.

page A-12/A-13 is a two page spread with a VW bus featured promenently
and in color.

so they say it is a 68 when it is more likely a 78 but it is a great
ad for your office or workshop
