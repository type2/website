&gt; I did get one hint from down under (Australia) that suggested 'liming=20
&gt; white'.
&gt;=20
&gt; Up here, this translates to 'white wash' or,

&gt; &gt; &gt; I have a '72 camper with the white 'birch' paneling.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I would like to re:finish the paneling.  Any suggestions?

&gt; &gt; &gt; I can use Acetone to strip the heavy covering, but I just cannot, for=

&gt; &gt; &gt; original stuff.
&gt; &gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt; a white'ish color.
