Subject: Looking for PO

Hi Volks,

I thought this would be a good forum to see if I can find the previous
owner to my bus. It is a Yellow 1977 Westy sold to the person I bought
it from in Columbia MD. The person I want to find is the person who sold
it to them. The identifying thing I can think of is that it has a
Grateful Dead Stealy in the center of the gas gauge nicely done under
the plastic. And a bumper sticker that has a Grateful Dead Bear and it
read Bearlymovin'. One last identifying sticker would be on the inside
of the back hatch is of the Jerry Garcia Band. Well thought I would see
if anyone knew of this bus being sold in MD years ago.

Peace

Meg
