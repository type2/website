Don't need any parts, don't know where to store it.
&gt;(3) I know that recent cars must pass an emissions test, but I haven't
&gt;found any info about a safety inspection requirement.  Is there one?

No Safety inspections down here...Safety...what's that! As for emissions I 
didn't need any for my '77 Westy. But if it's a late model, emissions can be 
a pain in the .... if you're in the metro area. They still don't have 
emissions in the rest of Georgia.

Good luck getting them down here!
