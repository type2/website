Subject: Wipers not contacting screen

    I had the same trouble with my '71 LHD Westy, and living in the NW
US I need all of the rain-handling tricks I can manage. I remedied it by
replacing the cheap-ass generic wiper heads (from the PO) with Trico
&quot;Airfoil&quot; type heads. They're metal, with little wing thingies that take
advantage of the Bus's naturally streamlined form (wink) and road wind
to hold the blade against the glass. Some careful experimentation with
bending was necessary, and I did give up a little bit of &quot;wiped area&quot; on
the outside edges, especially on the RH side. I've also put in a wiper
delay, an electric washer pump and a booster fan on the defroster. Now
it's almost like driving a damned Lexus. Well, sort of.
