I have them on both my '85 Vanagon GL and my '75 Westfalia.  I like them on
both vehicles, but my bus experience is limited, since Bob the Rustfalia
went kaputt on the second trip with the Kirklands.  They handled curvy rural
highways and straight freeways very nicely.  I have absolutely no complaints
about them on the Vanagon.  Handling is predictable and they're quieter than
the Laredos I used to have.  No problem in windy conditions.
