Subject: Re: [T2] I'm getting the busloops

How 'bout my busloops?

Lessee.... Do I keep the 70's Sportsmobile because the top pops straight up 
and sleeps two above in case my wife can convince her niece and husband to 
come on a camping trip with us, or do I keep the 62 panel with Z-bed because 
it's cool and my friends helped me build the motor, or do I keep the 65 
Westy because it's vintage westy, or do I keep just camp in the 72 
transporter because it has a bed too and is a more multipurpose vehicle, or 
do I keep the 60's bay westy because I should get out of T4 motors because 
T1 is easier to work with, or should I keep the 73 Westy because T4 is after 
all a stronger, cooler running, and more reliable engine (and it's a clean 
vehicle), or should I keep the 75 Riviera because it's T4 too and was given 
to me (less invested in it) or should I keep the 74 Safare because the high 
top is more headroom and it has a porsche motor?

I'm sure after we try some of these out in real camping trips (and get them 
all running....) we will choose one to call our very own!

&gt; Oh no, you all have it all wrong. Perhaps as you/we go along the loops get 
&gt; bigger.
