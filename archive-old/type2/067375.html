&gt; Searchers beware. As advertised:
&gt; 
&gt; VW CAMPER 77, mint condition, custom wood cabinets, new stereo,
&gt; 3500 miles on rebuilt engine, runs excellent, many extras, customized
&gt; wooden luggage rack, $4000. (860) 669-1822. Clinton
&gt; 
&gt; Reality:
&gt; 
&gt; 1977 VW camper far from mint condition. Problems include a badly repaired front
&gt; panel (rust under bondo with cracks big enough for my pinkie), rust along seams
&gt; between panels, under door sills, under windshield (which is cracked), paint was
&gt; brushed over most rust, engine was rebuilt in 1991 and has over 40K and is
&gt; ROUGH, entire engine and exhaust was painted silver to hide the corrosion,
&gt; clutch is going, has a nice $150 tape deck though ;-)

Ooh! Scary Halloween story!

Makes you wonder, don't it? Our '71 Westy was advertised the same way -
mint, rebuild, etc. Got there and it was rusty in the rockers and
corners, windshield cracked, thick coat of primer, engine with
compression of about 50 in #3, rust holes in the floor, front axle
problems...

We ended up buying it because the seller was able and willing to
recognize reality and come *way* down on the price - but why do people
even do this?! Sure, I have had to sell cars of mine before, and you try
and make it sound as good as you can, but you can't change reality!
