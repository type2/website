Subject: Oil pressure extension hose

Everyone:

I know that a lot of you with Type IV engines either have
or want to have oil pressure sensors. And the senders won't
go into the block in the stock location. So, you buy the
extension hose from the gauge vendor (like VDO) for 
some astranomical amount, like $20. 

But, you can use a flexible extension for a grease gun, avail.
at every FLAPS or hardware store for about $3 or $4. Rated
to 1500 PSI or more, oil and grease stable, and just the right 
length. 

Man, I love it when I stumble across deals like this...

Just thought everyone should know...

Chris Chubb
