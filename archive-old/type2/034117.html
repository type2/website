Subject: Re: Christmas present...

I've got some spares...which might be better than cash...since other folks
(outside our own community) may give cash.

Of course, if this is like what happens in Memphis whenever someone gets
publicly exposed for having problems, she'll end up with a $250,000 trust
fund, a house, etc.

Let us know if you find out what she needs to fix the bus.

BTW, I'll bet it's a problem with her ground connections. ;) Joe

&gt;In the meantime, I am willing to put alittle cash in the pot as well, not
too 
&gt;much or I'll end up there too! But maybe with a few of us not in the Bay
area 
&gt;pitching in a few dollars and those in the area pitching in a little time
and 
&gt;mechanical know how...we'll improve her situation.
