The standard colors on my old '76 as well as '74, and '77 parts
buses I had were PASTEL WHITE, over AFRICAN RED, I'm not sure of the
L codes but a good PPG shop should have lists for the '70's from which
the names will suffice.  African Red is a real real LOUD red, IMHO
brighter than Porsche Gaurds Red, or VW's later Mars Red.  A great color
with a lot of orange to it.  Pastel White is a bit too yellow for my
taste when I painted the '76 I mixed 1 to 1 pastel white and VW alpine
white for a brighter look as the alpine white was at hand from a rabit
repaint.
