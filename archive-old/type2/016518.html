Subject: Re: Tuning the Type 2 Operator

To Mark and the list:

I've been driving VWs since 1968, starting with a 40 HP '65 Beatle
progressing to a '73 Thing and onwards to the water cooled cars.  If you
think driving a mid '70s bus is slow, try driving a 40 HP 1965 micro-bus
over the Green Mountains of Vt. with 2000 lbs of produce on board.  I
did weekly in my teens for a produce wholesaler.  I think I could have
walked up those hills faster.  

Over the years I have developed a number of methods of dealing with the
&quot;idiots&quot; (drivers) in Mass where I dove my Beatle in the early '70s (the
era of big time muscle cars), and now in NY's Albany area.  I do the
following things:

	1.  Go at a speed that is reasonable and prudent.  This means try to
cruise with the traffic.  I generally stick to the right hand lane on 4
lane roads and the middle lane on 6 lane roads.  This leaves room for
the idiots to go by me at 90 MPH, which they do frequently.

	2. Accelerate at about half throtle and wind 'er up to about 4K RPM
before shifting.  This seems to give the best performance with a
resonable compromise in MPG and engine wear.  More than half throtle
doesn't seem to make the car..er van accelerate a whole lot faster so
why bother.  Saves gas too.

	3. Expect the unexpected.  Here in NY it legal to pass on the right. 
Be prepaired for it, 'Cause they are gonna do it.  To do so I watch to
rear view mirrors constantly for speeders, etc. coming my way.  With
advace knowledge that high-speed-Harry is bearing down on you, you can
prepare yourself for dealing with him.

	4.  Try to use ramps leading to the Interstate that have long
acceleration ramps.  Here in Albany there are a number of off and on
ramps that are shorter than normal.  I avoid them like the plague.  I
prefer ones that go downhill onto the Interstate.

	5.  Take alternative routes.  I have a choice in routes for communiting
to work.  One way uses heavly traveled I90 into Albany which is 12 miles
long.  The other is a 2 lane country road which is 15 miles long.  The
long way is somewhat erratic in driving time as you can only go as fast
as the guy in front of you and it is inhabited by school busses (read
rolling stop signs).  The I90 route gives more consistant driving times
but is considerably more hetic.  So I leave a little earlier, take the
longer route and get there more relaxed.

	6.  When a driver flips me off, I show 'em the peace sign from the
'60s.  After all, your driving a VW bus, the vehicle that simbolizes the
peace movement.  Why not reflect the attitude too?

	7.  Although it might be fun, I don't antaginize the guy behind me with
a bumper sticker that says &quot;I may be slow, but I'm ahead of you!&quot;  It
minimizes the anger quotient.  I do have one that says &quot;I'm peddling as
fast as I can!&quot;  It kinda appoliges in a fun sorta way.

	8.  On long trips I have been known to use a radar-detector-testor.  A
handy little device that will trip the other guy's radar destector with
a press of a button.  It slows 'em down real fast.  It also causes you
to drive at just below the speed limit so people will go by you.  Makes
a long trip much more entertaining.  Made from a microwave door opener
controller just slightly retuned. That said, be advised that the FCC
frowns upon them highly, and no I don't have mine any more, nor do I
have the plans for making one.  But if you see one advertised.......

	9.  During a recent trip to Tuscon, I noted that the drivers there have
a tendency to drive off from a stoplite with their foot to the floor
only to brake hard at the next traffic lite a mile down the road. 
Although we don't have such widely spaced blocks here on the east coast,
my approach is to try to match my speed to the traffic lite timing. 
Most hiway engineers will time the lites to permit a block of traffic to
hit all green lites if that block of traffic is moving at a particular
speed.  If you go at that speed, you will just keep on rollin' and you
can smile as the idiot screams by you just in time to stop at the next
lite.

	10.  Meditate, meditate, meditate.  I realise that meditation is a New
Age kind of thing, and not everybody is open to the idea, but it does
keep me calm and allows me to center on the act of driving.  If I am
calm and focused, I can comfortably ignore the emotions brought about by
the idiot that just cut me off so I can deal with the next set of
problems comming my way just seconds down the road.  If we always
pratice the golden rule, &quot;Do unto others as you would have them do unto
you&quot;, then you will find yourself more forgiving towards others, thus
more relaxed at the end of a drive.

I hope this helps with dealing with too slow volksies.
