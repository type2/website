&gt; &gt; &gt; The 68-79 Bentley lists four different bars with differing

&gt; &gt; &gt; 72-up station wagons got 26.9mm bars and the spring plates were

&gt; &gt; First, exactly is a &quot;station wagon&quot; and how does one find out for
&gt; &gt; sure if one has a station wagon or other bus?
&gt; 
&gt; Station wagons came with middle and rear seats, along with deluxe trim
&gt; in most cases.  The second digit of the VIN is 2 for a station wagon, 3
&gt; for Kombi and Campmobile, 1 for a panel van.

Whoa!  I think you may have hit me with another job to do on the bus!?!?

my van is a 78 with a first two digits 228!

so I have a &quot;station wagon&quot;  BUT, my van was modified with an HP bus drop
floor that adds several hundred pounds to the weight, AND I use it for
work and have a lot of &quot;junque&quot; piled in the back!

think maybe it is time to measure my torsion bars, I just thought they
needed replacing maybe they need upgrading!
