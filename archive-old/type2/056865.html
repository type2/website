Subject: Bus sold- looking for new one
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I am entreating a very generous offer to buy my bus. Does anyone have any
buses (71 or 76-69 model) that they would like to sell. Either restored or
original as long as it is 90% perfect. Budget is up to $7,500.00.

In the alternative, would anyone like a passenger from Cincinnati, Oh or
close to BBTA. I have my own tent and will pay for gas. Let me know ASAP so
that I can conclude my bus deal. TIA TBear
