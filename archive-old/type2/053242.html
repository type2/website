Subject: Oil additive for seals

Any recommendation for an additive to cure/swell leaky seals??

I am leaking at both front and rear (fan area) of a '78 2 liter, stick.  I 
am possibly leaking at oil cooler, but I 'think' not.

Although I am leaking, it is only an occasional drop or two reaching the 
ground, not so the puddle as before.  Reason: I super cleaned a semi-clogged 
oil breather box at top-rear of engine.  I believe I have released a lot of 
pressure from my crankcase, so giving my seals a break.

I am not leaking at push rod tubes, valve cover, dip stick boot, oil pump, 
oil filler tube, and that oil pressure switch at top-rear of engine. But, 
ohmygosh, I DO push a lot of oil out of the engine at 70 MPH, even if 
briefly driving that fast!!  I mean, A LOT!!

Thanks
