Subject: Radiator Installation in 'Bay Window'
Message-ID: &lt;374FF919.EA39AE84_at_whidbey_dot_com&gt;

I plan to order a 1.9L non turbo diesel long block soon (I've got most of the engine
accessories rounded up).  I want to install this in a bay window or air cooled
Vanagon that has a 4.57 final drive ratio transmission. 

There were a couple of posts a few weeks ago about radiator installation in the path
of one or both of the two engine air intake vents.  I saved the 'Mexican water
cooled bay window' site, but deleted the posts which I think had links to sites
about the radiator installation in the engine compartment :-(.  I would appreciate
some shed light, sites, ideas, or the posts in question about the install of the
cooling system for a water cooled engine in an air cooled bus/Vanagon?  Thank you.
