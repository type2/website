&gt;Ok here is my 2 cents. About 6 months ago I called on an advertised
&gt;'72 bus. The guy I spoke with said it was an early '72 with an upright
&gt;engine. He said they did make *some* '72's with the upright, but not
&gt;too many. If this is true you may have one of these rarities......Chip

Ok, but that wouldn't explain the 73-up high mounted front turn signals
which the replaced front nose skin theory does so neatly.  I say it was
abducted by Brazilian aliens and midway through the watercooled transplant
they had to wait for an OEM gasket kit when their hideout was discovered.
In a hasty coverup, the Brazilian government reassembled the bus leaving the
transplanted nose skin on and sold it to an anonymous American interest.  

The Bus Files...kinda spooky, huh?
