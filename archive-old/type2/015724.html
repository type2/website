&gt;Well, it's either an 1800 that had twin carbs originally, or a 2000 that
had AFC FI originally, it's conceivable that you have a 75 with an 1800,
but it must be a real early 75, since all the 75s I've seen had the FI
system and 2000 motor. 

The ones you've seen must have been converted.  1975 model year US spec
busses all came with 1800cc engines with fuel injection.  It should be
noted that the 1975 model year runs from somewhere around 9/94 to 9/95.  No
1975 model year busses came with twin carbs AFAIK.
