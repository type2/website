Subject: [T2] Head removal on type 4 2000cc


&gt; I need to replace my heads on my 1979 Fi because I just got a compression
&gt; reading from my mechanic of 110,90,120,0. Is there anyway to remove the
&gt; heads without completely removing the engine. If anyone could let me know
on
&gt; this operation.

Dianne did it,her first solo bus repair. If she is still on the list,
you ( or your mechanic:) may get a pmail.
How did your mechanic explain that the compression test
indicates that replacing the head(s)  will correct it?
Zero is a serious number. The 90 is also suspicious.
Which cylinders had these numbers?
