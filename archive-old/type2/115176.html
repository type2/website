&gt;&gt;Yeah. I was just at &quot;horrible Fright &quot; yesterday and seen the ATV jack. It
&gt;says it's
&gt;rated at 1200 lb. Should be cake for a 400' engine. It was listed at 
&gt;$149.00.
&gt;I'll be getting the ATV jack before I put in the new engine. Even if I have
&gt;to pay the $150.

I paid around $80 for a 1200lb  ATV jack, at Costco, a couple of months ago. 
I noticed Harbor Freight was higher.
