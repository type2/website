Subject: Make your own pod for luggage rack

Re storage on luggage rack: (I can send pics to the dimensionally
challenged, or ask me for the web site showing this).
My sig shows the pod I put on my Westy- besides space for lots of
decals, it holds: 1. stock VW tent minus the poles (I hang it under the
awning). 2. 50 ft hank of house extension cord. 3. quickie tent (no
floor) I fasten to awning when bugs are not a problem. 4. Folding chair
(the collapse into a tube shape kind. 5. 10 &quot;waffle block&quot; van levelers;
these interlock to various heights and can be used to get out of snow or
sand. 6. Ground cloth tarp. 7. 1gall. spare gas can. 8. water jug
(minute made 3 qt OJ jug). 9. 4&quot; length of 3&quot; dryer vent, aluminum (for
running bus in place to make power and divering exhaust away). 10. flat
box to hold tent pegs, hammer, rope, spring clamps, etc.
   The pod is made as follows: the base is made from 1.5x .75&quot; &quot;  wood
stock that has plywood paneling stapled to the bottom. It forms a
rectangle that fits into the luggage rack bottom.  You can cord it in
place, but since I had 2 eyebolts sticking up already for a spare tire,
I cut slots in the bottom so the eyebolts poked through; using 4x4&quot;
electrical box covers, I cut slots in them to fit over the eyebolts. 
Wedges go through the eyebolts to keep the box in place. With the pod
locked, no one can pull it away.
     The pod shape is made by nailing/stapling masonite to the box base
on one side, and then bending it to form a half-round shape that is then
fastened to the other side of the base.  Lay this agains so paneling and
trace the INSIDE shape of the bend with pencil. (If you are too big,
send a kid in to do this).  Cut out 2 doors this way.  Fasten them with
piano hinges to the bottom frame.
At the top, for &quot;stopping&quot; the doors, I traced part of the curve onto
some 2x4 stock and cut it out.  Glue it in place; add screws from the
outside to keep it there.   Get cabinet locks and use these to lock the
end doors.  Paint the masonit throuroughly; remember it is made from
&quot;paper&quot; but as a curved arch, you can sit or stand on the box.  My
milage did not go down with this on top.  It is light enough for one
person to remove it.  For access, stand on the heel arch (door open) or
make a ladder as I did using a boat ladder hung from u shapes I bend
from aluminum stock that is bolted to the bottom of the driver side trip
that matches the sliding door track arch.  A bungee clips it to fender.
