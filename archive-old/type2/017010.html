Subject: Bus clutch question

I posted about this a few months back, and no one had an answer.  Here's
hoping that some more people have joined the list and can help me. :)

I have a 1971 loaf; it has been driven only for a few hours in several
months.  About 2 months ago, I tightened the clutch cable (the pedal had
a few inches of play), started her up, and ran through the gears.  She
wasn't driven in the months before or since then.  (Since her hand-brake
doesn't work, I leave her parked and stuck in Reverse, since the parking
lot slopes down toward her nose.)  About 1 month ago, I went to start
her up and couldn't get her out of reverse.  I could push the clutch
pedal all the way to the floor and not budge the shifter out of reverse.

Would 1 month of just sitting account for that?
Is the clutch cable most likely the problem, or does it sound like
something else?
If I tighten the existing cable again, should she run?
How long should it be before it loosens again and I can't change gears?
How long should it be if she's driven daily rather than sitting?

I have a replacement clutch cable and sleeve; I haven't put it on yet
because (a) this will be my first major car repair project and (b) it's
been raining and snowing since then.  I forgot to get a replacement for
the little rubber mini-sleeve that hangs out near the clutch arm,
though.  How necessary is that part?  Could the dysfunctional state of
the current one explain the loosening?
