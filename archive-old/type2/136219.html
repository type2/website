&gt; From Eric Arnold Thu Dec  9 16:48:33 2004
&gt; Hello all,
&gt; I doubt many people remember my original post, since
&gt; it was 6 weeks ago.
&gt; Long story short........My 77 2.0L FI bus wasnt
&gt; starting.
&gt; After much trial and error the bus finally went to
&gt; the shop this week.
&gt; They got it started after replacing the spark plugs
&gt; since they deemed mine
&gt; &quot;too cold&quot; (whatever that means), and adjusting the
&gt; valves.
&gt; 
&gt; Here is the current situation. It starts, but doesnt
&gt; idle well, and is
&gt; blowing out some black smoke.
&gt; My bus has never smoked before, so Im not sure whats
&gt; going on there. It has
&gt; sat for 6 weeks waiting for repair.
&gt; 
&gt; The shop is saying either the CHT sensor, or the
&gt; AFM.
&gt; 
&gt; What do you think?
&gt; Thanks!
&gt; Eric

First, black smoke indicates too rich a mixture. 
(Primer.  Black smoke:  Gas. Blue Smoke:  Oil. 
Billowy white smoke:  Auto Transmission Fluid.)  My
'78 has not had this problem you describe, but a '75
with its Air Flow sensor stuck open, did not idle
well, and caughed and smoked (black) with a press of
the gas pedal.  That is the extent of my understanding
about black smoke and FI.
   
Testing the &quot;stuck air flow sensor&quot; theory above? 
Easy to test.  Remove the AFS &amp; Air Filter Unit from
the vehicle, detach the big plastic box that houses
the air filter, and use a pencil or pen carefully in
the AFS opening to confirm it is closed, and moves
freely without binding.  Bentley discusses the very
same maintenance procedure.  It's pictures also teach
you the &quot;rotational&quot; nature of the flow sensor, and
how it is supposed to move.  It is spring-loaded and
should return to it's rest position after you have
removed the pen or pencil.
   
Spark Plugs for our vintage 2.0 Liter engines have
some 2 flavors...  Bosch BOS-W7CC and Bosch BOS-W8CC. 
The W7CC is &quot;cold,&quot; and the W8CC is &quot;hot.&quot;  I would
presume you had W7CC plugs, and the mechanics decided
to put new W8CC's or their other manufacturer
equivalents into your '77 bus.  (Bosch BOS-WR8CP are
platinum &quot;hot&quot; plugs for our engines.)  These spark
plug models are marked in parts manuals as good for
'72 to '79 VW Type 2's.   Just looked it up, and your
&quot;GD&quot; series motor uses either of the plugs shown
above.  My '78 is a &quot;GE&quot; series motor, and uses most
of the same parts.  (My head and exhaust system
differ.)  Spark plug-wise, the original specs called
for Bosch brand W142-M2 plugs, = Beru brand 145/14/3L,
= Champion brand N288.  But if you do research _at_ an
auto parts house in 2004, not even the Champion spark
plug is referenced.  Use the new BOS-W7CC or BOS-W8CC
nomenclature for alternate manufacturer equivalency. 
   
I have run both &quot;cold&quot; and &quot;hot&quot; plugs in my bus.  I
&quot;hot&quot; plugs seem to work better, though I'm open to
facts and rebuttal from better informed users.
