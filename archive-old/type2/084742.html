&gt;...
&gt;Now it is possible you confused manifold vacuum with port vacuum. Port
&gt;vacuum signal is generated via Burneulli's Principle in the carb's
&gt;venturi. The larger the volume of air flowing through the carb., the
&gt;stronger the vac. signal. At idle there is very little air flowing through
&gt;the carb and the vac. signal is very small. Basically no vacuum. At
&gt;wide-open throttle (WOT) and high RPM, the port vacuum signal is
&gt;strongest.

Wrong.  At least in any carb I've ever seen on a bus.

&gt;...
&gt;
&gt;I know someone is running around with a vac gauge attached. What does it
&gt;show?


It shows vacuum advance going to ZERO under full throttle.
