Subject: Re: [T2] Dual Kadrons, Breather and Charcoal Can ?

Don't worry. All the input I can get is appreciated. I'll have to look
into the points you gave me to check. I had heard these carbs
typically wore out at the shafts, so I figured if they wouldn't
adjust, I've just have to replace them.

 Sorry for all the rambling, but you are reminding me of all the trouble
 I had.
 
 My 34s had reached that point, where anything I did had no effect on
 the idle or running of the carbs. I rebuilt them with the kits from Bus
 Depot, took the intakes off and put new gaskets on there too. After
 doing that I was able to actually tune then and get the idle right,
 they will run strong if you can muscle through the process. It was
 longer to tune them than to rebuild them, that was depressing. My
 unisyn was certainly useful but they aren't an easy tune. You may also
 want to check that the hoses connected to the carbs are all the correct
 dimensions and lengths, these can throw their running way off, also
 make sure that the wires are all intact and connected snugly. I had
 some major stalling issues with that as well as with the carbs leaking
 where the mount to the intakes, new gaskets took care of that one.
