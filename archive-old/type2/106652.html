Subject: Break Job Advice

Hi,

My bus started to make noises when breaking (like metal against 
metal) so I think it's time to work on the brakes. Would you 
recommend one of the brake repair shops (meineke, midas, speedy, 
pepboys, etc), or should I try to do
the job myself?

Thanks a lot for your advice. Regards,

Rogelio
