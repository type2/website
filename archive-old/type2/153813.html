Subject: Re: [T2] newbie question about mechanical fuel pump on type IV
  engine

This is off the top of my head..
the large port is the inlet
the next smaller is the outlet

the smallest one is a vent,, and just needs about 6&quot; of hose hanging off it 
to allow it to breath and not allow road dust in.

&gt; The mechanical pump has two ports above the pump body, and one port below 
&gt; the
&gt; pump. Does anyone out there know how these three ports on the mechanical 
&gt; pump
&gt; should be connected, or know of an posting in the archive that explains 
&gt; this?
