Subject: '79 Windshield Gasket

Volks,
   Heres what happen to me today...if anybody has any comments or
suggestions please reply.  Ok here we go, I have a 1979 bus, California
emissions (but that doesn't matter) I removed the front Windshield to do
some body work. I ordered a new gasket from Rocky Mountain Motor works, as I
was tiring to put the gasket on the window. well you probably know where I
am going..yep the window cracked...no problem I called my local glass
company and within hours they were at my door with a new tinted windshield
anxious to install the windshield, as he tried to install my gasket, he was
amazed as I was that the gasket was about 6-8 inches short. Can you believe
that. Well he got on the phone with his supervisor to get the correct
gasket, well the supervisor told me that all after market gaskets for VW are
made to short then he really make me laugh we also added that I will have to
get the gasket from the dealer. Well needless to say I called bus boys and
was guaranteed the gasket they sell will be the correct size..so now I await
the new gasket. BTW I did call VW dealer and guess what..yup you got it
right again...obsolete items. Any comments or similiar problems or even
better yet any ideas to get this window in.

Thanks in Advance
