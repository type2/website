&gt;I once met this dude that made an interesting case for his radio that
&gt;bolted to the side of his walk-thru seat(Pointing straight up!).  He  said
&gt;it made it easy to reach while driving, but I wasn't convinced.  I say
&gt;duck tape the sucker to the top of the dash.

Some Citroen cars had their radios in the center console pointing straight
up, where the emergency brake should be (they had the emergency brake in
the dash where the radio should be).  They also had the ignition switch
between the seats.  I didn't mind this at all, except that dirt and dust
tended to fall into the tape player.

I just removed my stereo from the glove box (not an option for your
splittie, of course) and am planning on building an overhead console which
will house the stereo, CB, speakers, and maybe the clock.  Lots of vans
have similar overhead consoles and they seem to work well, as long as they
don't obstruct the view out of the front.

I was also thinking it would be cool if the CB could interrupt the stereo
when something comes across - does anyone know how to wire that up??

Another bizarre place to mount the stereo would be on (or in?) the drivers
door, vertically of course.  My dad did this with his old Ford truck.  Why,
I have no clue - well maybe it was so us kids couldn't mess with the
stations.  :)

One thing I think would be extremely cool would be to mount your car stereo
speakers inside some old drive-in movie speaker boxes - the ones that hang
over a window (anyone remember those?).  You wouldn't have to hang them on
the window, just set them on the dash or something.  Never seen any for
sale, though...
