Subject: Fantastic Voyage

Last Thursday night I made the maiden voyage from Boulder, CO, to Summit
County and Breckenridge, CO.  It was about a 2 1/2 hour drive to go some
eighty odd miles.  However, the elevation gain in 30 or so miles was
approximately 6000 feet.  A friend and I piled into the bus Thursday
night, along with four snowboards, a set of skis, a 1/4 keg of beer
(securely fastened on top of the bus) and various camping equipment.
Armed only with the stock heater/defroster and a 15 year old Coleman
catalytic heater, we took to the road.  I was amazed at how well the
defroster worked!  Not much heat, but it kept the windshield clean.

For the most part, I pulled the pass over the continental divide in
second gear, cruising b/t 25 and 30 mph.  I was able to to hit 45 in
third during some of the flatter spots, but it would always drop to 30
mph in third gear on the uphills.  During the climb, my oil pressure hit
210 degrees F., but quickly cooled down as we dropped down on the other
side of the continental divide.

Just wanted to share my experiences with the group.  BTW, I'll be making
the same trip tomorrow morning.  Have a great weekend.

Alabama Pete and Kate the '78 Westy, high in Colorado!
115k on the bus, 1.5k on the engine.

PS.  I'll be posting pics of the engine rebuild as soon as I get around
to scanning them all in!  You can't tell from the picture, but I've got
some meaty Swedish snow tires that really kick butt!
