Subject: compression reading

I posted a couple of days ago about power issues.  
Since then, we adjusted the valves (our first time and
we did it unsupervised- could we have done it wrong? 
it seemed right!).  And just now we checked the
compression and got really low readings.  They were
all in the same ball park, but LOW:
 #1- 75, #2- 83, #3- 75, #4- 80
This is a rebuild at only 39,000 miles.  We drove
successfully from Colorado to California 6 months ago
until our transmission went out.  Everything else
seemed fine though.
We check the oil everytime we get gas, the engine
always runs a little hot, and smells a little, but it
is never so hot that we cannot handle the dipstick.
Does it seem logical that our engine is damaged
already?
