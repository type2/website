&gt;dirty maybe, but removing the firewall panel is a lot quicker than

My 72 bus is in a state of complete dismantlement, there ain't no more that 
can come off and while the fuel tank is out I'm going to cut this 'quick and 
dirty' hole in the tank bay roof and put a nice neat SEALED panel in so that 
when the gauge unit quits I don't need to drop the engine to get the thing 
out.

If anyone has done this 'properly' your comments would be welcome.

I am about half way through a complete rebuild, including a major repair to 
the windscreen surround which can be seen at:

Mike Howles' guide to windscreen surround repair!!
and while you are there check out Andy Gray's bus and the work he did, it's 
his website and he kindly gave up some space for the benefit of others who 
may have windscreen corrosion problems.
