Subject: Re: hard-core tin trivia

&gt;The left and right pieces are far from symmetrical.  The right piece
&gt;has a cutout for the heat riser and for the road draft tube.


	I think I'm gaining on this...

	For older engines with the air cleaner on top of the carb, the
warm-air-to-air-filter hose is on the left side of the engine.  When the
air cleaner was moved to the right side of the engine bay, this hose
followed.

	Looks like a given engine should have the ~1-inch elliptical hole
in only one of these tin pieces:  left side earlier, right side later, as
far as I can tell.

	Anybody need the rhs piece w/o the hole?  Willing to accept it in
trade for the lhs piece w/o the hole?  (I've go the rhs piece w/ hole, but
no lhs piece at all.)

Cheers,
-Greg
