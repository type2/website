Subject: lost message from raleigh

my computer crashed today as i was reading my mail, so not only did i
miss all of todays and yesterdays messages, but i noticed that someone
from, i think it was interpath, wrote me saying he could help me put my
webpage back up, etc.   if you read this message, could you send me your
message again, i lost it before i was done reading
it...                   I'm sorry,              Dallas
