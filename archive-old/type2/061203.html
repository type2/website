&gt; &gt; I would not recommend the Muir guide for maintaining a 79 F.I. 2.0L bus.
&gt; 
I would unquestionably disagree with this. I agree that the Bentley is a good guide but is way to clinical for someone starting out. Furthermore, Bentley is constantly referring to VW Tools which no one has access to. Haynes at least offers alternatives to the special tools  &quot;...we found that you could take 37 rubberbands and wrap them around the windscreen....&quot;  The Muir book remains essential because the most valuable information in the book has nothing directly to do with repairs, but attitude. the &quot;how to drive&quot; and &quot;how to buy&quot; chapters are both essential and still important, and the fact that he assumes you still have a stock motor should tell you something about where your heads at if you don't!!!!!
