Hi folks,

Hope someone out there can help. This is getting strange. I'll try to =
make it coherent. I bought a 70 Westy a year ago and have been slowly =
trying to get it on the road. The steering has been a problem from the =
day I bought it and I have left that as the last fixit job. What I have =
done so far is to replace the shocks with KYB, replace the all ball =
joints, install grease fittings everywhere I could find a place, had the =
front end aligned, removed all the CV joints repacked and installed with =
new boots, and adjusted the brakes.=20

The steering has had a click when turning the steering wheel about 2-3 =
inches either direction and the wheel is loose (not engaged to steer) in =
that range. The front end did not have a solid feel from 0-40 then at =
about 45 the front end felt like it was floating and there was little =
control. Thought I would totally loose it a few times trying to get it =
home.

So I thought it was the steering box. So did a few others. After =
spending $350 and a morning installing the new box I'm not so sure this =
is the problem.

The steering wheel is reeeeeal tight. Although as I drove it home I =
noticed that it would loosen up and then get tight again when I would =
slow down for a stop. If I jerked the wheel back and forth quickly then =
it would loosen up again - temporarily. Before I installed the new =
steering box I could move the splined shaft at the top of the steering =
box easily. I noticed that the part that bolts to the shaft and then to =
the steering coupler did not have splines for some reason. It seems like =
it should otherwise why would the steering box shaft that it fits over =
have one? Anyway I could barely turn the steering wheel once the box was =
in so out it came. While the box was out I thought I would check the =
front wheels and they were tight (hard to turn by hand while the van was =
off the ground). I even disconnected the tie rods.=20

Any ideas of what I should check? I mean with a new steering box I =
should be able to turn the steering wheel with one finger if the front =
end is off the ground - no such luck. It is tight until I jerk the =
steering wheel and then it is loose. It gives a loud click when turning =
the wheel in either direction 2-3 inches whether on or off the ground. I =
can't drive it this way and I sure am getting frustrated and broke. =
HELP!

Bill
