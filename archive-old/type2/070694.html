Subject: [VB] HELP! 67 engine lid busted

Cross posting out of desperation.

I went to close the engine lid on the 1967 bus and right hinge pin 
broke. The left side is looking questionable after struggling to 
close the lid with one side broken. I need help please! What size 
roll pin do I need to buy and what is the best way to remove the 
broken ones and install the new ones. The bus is my only means of 
transportation. The lid is not quite sealing. The temp her is in the 
30s and based on the fact that &quot;the heat&quot; is not &quot;the warm&quot; I do not 
think I will have any cooling problems tomorrow but I want to get 
this fixed ASAP before the lid falls off on the road or the temp goes 
back up.

Thanks so much!
