Subject: Junkyarding......

I went for a drive yesterday, looking for Westy wood for a 78 non-deluxe I bought last Monday night. A while
back I said the bays were drying up here in the central Calif self-serve yards......
Well, they are just about as plentiful in the yards as split buses ;(

Fresno Pick a Part: no bays
Fresno Pick n Pull: no bays, 1 Vanagon Westy
Fresno Westside: no bays, 1 stripped water Vanagon
Smiths in Madera: 1 stripped 73 Westy
Madera Pick a Part: 1 stripped 77 Westy, 3 water Vanagons
Merced Pick n Pull: 1 68 bay
Modesto Pick n Pull: 1 68 stripped Westy still had engine and trans, 3 water Vanagons [and 1 67 burned out
split bus waiting to come out]
Stockton Pick n Pull: no bays, no Vanagons [this yard had a 77 Westy that had cherry wood in it, this was the
reason for the drive, alas.... it was crushed] this is a massive yard, shocking to find it devoid of any VW
buses.
Sacramento Pick n Pull: no bays, no Vanagons
Rancho Cordova Pick n Pull import yard: 1 71 bay and 1 74 bay

Going from yard to yard, it does not seem so bad..... but the drive back is about 200 miles.
I spent more on gas than purchases!!  Left at 7:30 am, got home at 6:30 pm.
