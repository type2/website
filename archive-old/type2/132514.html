Subject: Another paint question

When I first got my bus, it was covered with a rusty patina. I assume 
that this is what's called &quot;pinhole rust.&quot; I rubbed it down with 
compound and waxed. That was six years ago, and there is no sign that 
any of what I took to be little pinholes of rust have bloomed.

Even so, I've assumed that if I ever wanted to paint, I would have to 
take the whole bus down to bare metal. At the same time, I know that if 
it's at all possible, it's smart to keep the factory paint and work 
over it.

Someone on the list once advised treating each of the &quot;pinholes,&quot; so 
that the bus would look like it has measles before painting. I wasn't 
so sure about that. I would say that there are 10 to 20 pinholes per 
square inch.

Anyone else have a similar deal? How did you handle it?
