Subject: Dellorto carb linkage

I was going to install the twin choke Dels on my 1800 today and all worked
well until I got to the linkage, (empi), that I have had in its original pkg
for years.  When I started to hook up the linkage, one bank of carbs and
manifold were 2 inches further towards the back of motor than the other side.
Is this just with dels, or do twin choke webers also have this? Or maybe the
linkage was made for webers and not dels, or maybe it is supposed to cross at
that odd angle for the hex bar.  If this is only for webers, does any one want
to trade or sell me the one I need used. Confused!
