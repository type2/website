[...]

Some have added the rubber toggle hold-downs to the front corners of their
early baywindow Westfalia poptops.  These are not original equipment.
Installing these requires drilling mounting holes in the bus body, adding
another potential water leak.

I've had excellent results using a pair of tiedown straps I made, which
attach to the gutters with vinyl-coated hooks.  One strap goes across right
at the rear of the front doors, and the other right at the rear of the
[closed] sliding door.  The straps are made of 1&quot; nylon webbing, assembled
with solid nylon [no rust stains] fittings.  They can be removed in seconds,
or installed in a minute or so.

FWIW...

&gt;&gt;  Does anybody know if rubber clamp downs were acessories in the front of
the 68-73 poptops.  I have seen some with two rubber clamps in the front and
this may help when the top blows up in high wind.
