Subject: [T2] Can we use SNIPs on VW digest lists?

Volks: Its Friday so I'll send this.
Many times I see  replies to a long article that quote the whole long
article.
In Digest mode, you often see the whole long article quoted
in its entirety several times. 
If you are quoting  a long article, or series of quoted articles, often you
can snip out huge sections
of the articles, and only quote the relevant part, this reducing the size
of the overall post quite a bit.

You may often see this in my posts. For example


{Bill Crick writes } Me Too! &lt;- I'm from AOL;-). I think that snips are good
too!

Blah Blah blah

{Bill Crick} SNIP.....

The Romans never snipped articles they were replying to which led to 
scrolls too heavy for the typical chariot of the day so they needed to use
their
very limited supply of VW busses for messenger service....

{Bill Crick} SNIP...
Blah bLAH bLAH
This concludes my 1100 page tome on VW busses influence on Ancient Rome
