&quot;Changes in Attitude. Changes in lattitude.&quot;

Circumstances dictate that I sell my 72 Westy, &quot;Male Menopause,&quot; and I am
offering it to the list first.

It is a nonpoptop camper but the sink/icebox unit is long gone. Other than
that, all camping equipment is complete and in working condition. Very
little rust, all of it surface &quot;cancer&quot; on the driver's side step. Paint is
in good shape but has the usual dings and chips on the sides due to other
people banging their doors against it in parking lots. My wife and I
stripped and redid the interior with indoor/outdoor carpet and all windows,
except the windshield, were professionally tinted. Seats have been
recovered and I have installed a Sony AM-FM cassette and amp into 2
&quot;kicker&quot; speakers in the back in front of the seat/bed and 2 midrange
speakers in the doors.

Mechanically, the bus is in excellent condition. The engine is a single
carb 1.8 Mark Stephens rebuild, installed in Sept 96. The transaxle was
replaced with a used unit in Sept 98. (Since it's winter I need to add that
the heater boxes are installed but not hooked up.) This bus has been my
daily driver and has been meticulously maintained. What I can't do myself
is done by our local VW guru. There is a dark jpeg available on the QRZ
website; go there and type in my callsign, K4ERC, and click go. It is not
the best view but it is the one I use on my QSL cards to confirm radio
contacts. I will try to make another jpeg this week to forward to
interested parties.

Among the miscellaneous parts included are the 1.8 engine I replaced. It
has been stored since Sept 96. I think it dropped a valve but have never
torn it down so cannot be sure. I also have a factory luggage rack that is
about 1/2 or 3/4 length that is correct for the 72. The clamps are gone but
suitable repalcements were available from a local outdoor shop the last
time I checked last year. I will not sell the rack separately unless the
purchaser does not want it. 

I am asking $3000 as this is a daily driver in great shape that can be
driven while being restored. Contact me via email if interested.

Thanks,
