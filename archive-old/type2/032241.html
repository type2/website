Subject: Oil strainer nut.
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.SOL.4.02A.9904200942170.27132-100000_at_insci14.ucsd_dot_edu&gt;

I am rebuilding the engine from my '77 van.  I have to put the oil
strainer and strainer cover back on, but there is not much thread
available, and the little baggie where I put these things doesn't contain
a nut, which is clearly needed.  What did this nut look like anyhow?
Should I losten the bolt which retains the strainer holder thingy and try
to pull said thingy downwards, to make more thread available?
