Subject: Re: [T2] Nut Size - Alternator

22 mm fits the rear pulley bolt on my 70 bay and I assume same for all
pre-72's. I have a 22mm combo wrench and a 22mm deep impact socket both in
sets I got at Harbor Freight on sale at prices I still don't quite believe.

Phil

&gt; &gt; And since I am looking for a &quot;best value&quot; purchase next time, which
wrench
&gt; &gt; (21mm or 22mm) would find the most uses on a 68 - 79 bay?  I mean, is
there
&gt; &gt; ANY PLACE other than the alternator nut to use one of these wrenches??
&gt;
&gt; 22mm.
