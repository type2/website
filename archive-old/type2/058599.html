Subject: RE: Stumbling on low tank? ('72 single carb)

&gt;Unscrew the big nut around the fuel outlet and pull the finger screen
&gt;out of the tank.  Clean the screen.

FYI, a few comments on the tank screen.

The two gaskets used on the fuel outlet tube are still available from VW.
The part #s are 311 201 235 and 111 209 139.  I don't see these mentioned by
people replacing their tank screen, so I'm guessing they aren't typically
used and folks rely solely on the crush ring at the base of the screen to
stave off leaks.  

It is possible that upon removal from the tank, the screen material can tear
from the ring.  New screens are available (111 209 147A for buses up to
'74), however the ones I've seen have a cork piece inserted on the inside,
top part of the screen, presumeably to prevent it from collapsing.  None of
the original screens I've removed from tanks had this cork (nor have I seen
a collapsed original screen), so either they weren't present originally or
they disintegrated and the fragments of cork were collected in the fuel
filter.  Maybe this is why George is recommending reusing the original screen?
