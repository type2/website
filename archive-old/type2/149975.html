Subject: Re: [T2] Bodywork question

I had the same question for my body guy. He said it is almost impossible
without &quot;factory priming&quot; the chassis. The factory would do all the body
work, then dip the whole chassis in a vat of rust preventative.

You can do the same thing if you can spray a high volume of rust-proofer
into the area, preferably not out of a spray can. Evidently the propellant
&quot;mists&quot; the paint way too much. He says he &quot;splashes&quot; in a thin mixture when
he can.

He also said in the areas where the panel is sealed, to make sure you seam
seal the metal edges so water and air can't mix. That is your best defense.

&gt; 
&gt; There's one thing about this tool that bothers me. It is most useful
&gt; for working box sections of the body -- places where it's inconvenient
&gt; or impossible to slip a dolly (or clean and paint). And when it
&gt; attaches the stud, there is going to be a small burn on the
&gt; inaccessible side.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm concerned about all those tiny burns promoting rust inside, with no
&gt; way to clean and paint them. But maybe the tacit understanding when
&gt; using this technique is that the visible body is going to look better,
&gt; but the panel is going to rust from the inside in time.
&gt; 
&gt; Am I worrying too much? Or is there something that can be done to
&gt; &quot;finish&quot; the inside?
