&gt; No partition behind either front seat, and seat rails on both the driver's
&gt; and the front passenger's seat pedestals.

Nope. This is perfectly normal.  1976 saw VW begin removing the
behind-seat partitions...as I recall the camper-bodies still had the
partition behind the drivers since, seperating it from the stove/sink
cabinet, but passenger bodies lost both dividers.
