Subject: Re:      Vacuum Line Routing

Dave,

In my 83 air-cooled automatic, there is one vacuum outlet on the IAD
connected to the fuel pressure regulator. The other outlet is on the
throttle body, and it is connected to the distributor. If you reverse them
the engine runs poorly and very rich. After some pondering, I would guess
that the throttle valve is connected with the tee to the fuel pressure
regulator and the IAD. I hope that this is some help.

Good Luck,

&gt; I am in the process of installing a remanufactured engine into my 1982
&gt; Westy (air cooled 2 liter).  I lost my notes on where the vacuum lines
&gt; go to the following:
&gt; The two vacuum inlets on intake air distributor and on the throttle
&gt; valve housing and the connections on the fuel pressure
&gt; regulator, deceleration valve, and the vacuum advance on the ignition
&gt; distributor.  I have a &quot;T&quot; in the line coming off the intake air
&gt; distributor but don't remember where to go from there (pressure
&gt; regulator, deceleration valve, or distributor).
