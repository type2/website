Well, that sounds like a &quot;good&quot; idea, something that's easier though,
don't set the parking brake unless you need it.  Just leave it in
1st gear on a flat and only set it if you're on an incline.

BTW, What about the front brakes?  I'd think a good grease job there
would do wonders to prevent rust and extend brake life!  &lt;G&gt;


&gt;     I suggest you apply a layer of grease inside the drums so they won't
&gt; rust. ;-)
