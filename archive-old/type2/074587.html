Subject: RE: [T2] Mexico says adios to beloved VW van

&gt; Then again, this was inevitable; it was just a matter of time.
&gt; They weren't going to sell the Bus forever.  Just as VW/Mexico
&gt; discontinued the Beetle when they started making the New Beetle
&gt; there, the handwriting was on the wall for the Brazilian Bus over
&gt; a year ago when VW/Brazil started tooling up to make the Eurovan there.


A listmember has pointed out a factual inaccuracy here.  While VW has
already discontinued the Brazilian Beetle, and 5 months ago announced plans
to discontinue it in Mexico, they have not actually ceased Mexican
production yet.  Production will continue there for 2-3 more years, but its
days are now officially numbered.
