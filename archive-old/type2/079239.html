========================&gt;
Actually, I believe as to whether or not SS will rust is a function of 
exactly what grade stainless steel we are talking about.

Certainly, 400 grade stainless fasteners will rust, but those grades higher 
up will resist rusting, and in a lot of environments will not rust at all.

&quot;Most&quot; fasteners we see out there in the &quot;general sales tool bin&quot; stainless 
market are still of 300 series or 18-8 quality, and these resist rusting 
quite well in most environments. In salt environment of a prolonged nature, 
there still exists a tendency to succumb to chloride attack, but this 
should not concern us as bus folk.
