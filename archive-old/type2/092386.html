Subject: Re: [T2] Kerosene:

Many places that do the acceptance of waste oil will reject any that has 
a chemical or kerosene odor to it.  It is because of the flammability 
issue.  Their tanks are inside in roll arounds and not outside buried.  
When working for one flaps  i have learned that the contaminated oil 
also brings in different regulatory rules on fire codes as to what you 
can store on the property.  In one place i worked we had about a 350 
gallon storage tank for the recycle.  Chemical contamination in it 
caused the entire 350 gallons to be recoded to the new flammability 
rating and made it illegal to have the tank on the property.  Kerosene 
and deisel have entirely different ratings than oil.
They do accept that there will be some mixed in, but not much.  
Depending on location your tank is now reclassified as waste fuel.

&gt; We have oil recycling here but often they get fussy about taking 
&gt; Kerosene or Diesel. I don't know what the rules are so I don't know if 
&gt; they are supposed to or not. I have in the past mixed it with the waste 
&gt; oil when I had enough.
