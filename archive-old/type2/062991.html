&gt;Okay, now what do I do?  The only thing related to gasoline in that
&gt;area is the vapor recovery siphon-break thingy.  As far as I know,
&gt;that tubing (which goes from the left side of the gas tank compartment
&gt;up into the fender, down again and across the rear of the engine
&gt;compartment) is all one piece--yes or no?  Where could it be leaking
&gt;from?  Is that siphon-break tubing REPLACABLE?
&gt;
&gt;Secondly, it's supposed to be a VAPOR recovery system, not a liquid
&gt;gas recovery system.  What the heck is going wrong here???  Yes, this
&gt;is the dented tank I mentioned earlier today in a post about the gas
&gt;gauge.

Someone (I forget who) wrote a few weeks ago that the tube that goes up and
down in the back corners of the bus ISN'T one piece and has at least one
rubber hose that you can just get to from the engine compartment by reaching
up there.  This hose was leaking on his bus.  I think these tubes provide for
gas expanding in a hot tank, so maybe that's why they have gas in them.

About the gauge, you said the sending unit wasn't vertical anymore.  If it was
horizontal enough, I could see float not going down as much as it should
(ie. hanging up) because gravity wouldn't be pulling it straight down, and
friction along the inside of the cylinder would come into play more.  Don't
know for sure if that's your problem.  I'd think it would depend on how big
an angle we're talking about.

Good luck!
