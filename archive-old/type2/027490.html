Hi Folks,
   I need your help trying to get a BN2 gas heater running and ready to 
install into our 71.  The lastest problem is this.  I have the heater 
mounted on a stand so I can run and work on it and have a small metal can 
rigged up as a gas tank and plumbed to the heater with a meter of regular 
gas line hose.  Well, just the other day while running the heater I had the 
tank situated a little higher than the heater, and found out that the fuel 
will continue to run through the pump, regulator, and nozzle until the tank 
is empty even when the heater is turned off and the pump not running.  You 
can imagine what would happen if I install the heater like this!
   My question to you is, what part of the heater fuel system should prevent 
this?  I want to get this heater running right and have some real heat  next 
winter!   Thanks in advance for your help.
