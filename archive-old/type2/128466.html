Subject: Re: [T2] Painting Over Krylon

Nothing short of sand blasing or a chemical strip Keith.
Sounds like the stuff that's balling up is some sort of urethane--which
has this chacactoristic when sanding.

Have Fun--

[T2] Painting Over Krylon 
I bought a bus a few years back, removed the worst of the rust and
sprayed it w/ krylon spray paint and topped that w/ krylon clear coat.
Now i decided to make it look right so I'm in the process of re-doing
it. Here's the problem. I don't know if i didn't let the spray paint
cure long enough before spraying the clear or what... but when you sand
this stuff, it turns into bubble gum. The paint does not sand off, it
raises up into a rubbery substance and clogs sandpaper (all grits)
almost immediately. I just stipped one side of the bus to bare metal
ugh... I used liquid stripper, then a sander. It suct. The other side is
quite straight and I planned on scuffing it, priming it and spraying
it... I can't sand it down to prime on. Any ideas that will save me from
stripping the whole stinking thing.
