Subject: EveryBus 2004 initial report

Hi Volks,

We're home safe and sound 1648 miles later.  15 Canadian Buses made an 
appearance, and I had the privilege to camp with all of them during my 
trip.

There will be lots of stories to tell... but I have a few things to 
look after before I will have time for a full trip report.

I will share a few pics... there are plenty more to come later in the 
week

Thanks Chris, EVERYBUS ROCKS!!!!!!!


Happy trails,
