&gt; well... I pulled the drum off of my friend's 71 she just got.  You know,
&gt; the bus with super jerky brakes that would pull the brake pedal up and
&gt; down? anyways... it was the shoe material.  the lining, whatever its
&gt; called came off of the metal shoe in a few pieces.  nasty.  never seen
&gt; it happen, or hear of it happening (besides a listee who emailed me
&gt; about it)
&gt; so we order new brake shoes... friday they'll be in.
&gt; 
&gt; so I get to finish the job up friday afternoon/night in 10 degree
&gt; weather.... fun!!
&gt; 
&gt; at least its in a garage and not windy...

Isaiah:
I've seen it happen. Maybe caused by overheating/ leaving emergency
brakes on?
BTW our climate is similar here in Waterloo, and I bought an 18,000 BTU
propane heater to go on a 30 lb lp tank. Many have been the times I've
been working in the snow and ice outdoors with that baby heating my
hands/ backside! OF course the usual caveats apply- it DOES have an open
flame- which is extremely effective at incinerating things when gasoline
is present.
But at $36 from Menards plus a tank robbed from your parents barbeque
grille, it'll make that brake job nearly heavenly!
