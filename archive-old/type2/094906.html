Subject: Re: [T2] Scraping in turns

&gt;Does anyone have any ideas of what else to check before I bite the bullet &amp; 
&gt;go back into the VW specialist to get them to find what the problem is?

Oy' Neale,
     Take a look at the backing plate, and see if it somehow distorts under 
a hard,left turn.  It's probably rubbing against the rotor.

     Eron
