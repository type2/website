Subject: RE: [T2] Broken thermostat wire

I think I also found this same problem on mine. I was removing the alternator
this weekend and noticed a wire that was not connected to anything. I am not
sure where it goes, but I am assuming that it goes to the thermostat on one
end and the flaps on the other. Anyone got some good pics of this that I can
look at?

I also do not drive mine much and never very long, maybe 20 minutes. I do not
have anything monitoring the temps, but it seems to be fine. The old dipstick
test after a long drive is still cool.

I think I need to fix this though...

Thanks,
Corbett
