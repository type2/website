Subject: Intake boot to oil breather hose

Ratwell says this guys is NLA.  Last night as I was putting the firewall 
back on and reattaching all the hoses the intake boot to oil breather 
hose fell apart.  I was able to find some 19mm internal diameter heater 
hose at my FLAPS.  Is this an acceptable replacement?  Are there better 
alternatives?

TIA,

dan
