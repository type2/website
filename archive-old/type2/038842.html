&lt;&lt; Option 1. Rebuild existing 1600 upright- estimate $1572.00
 Option 2. Buy already rebuilt 1600 (I think he called it a short block, so 
 would someone explain why its called that?) for  $1760.00
 Option 3. Install brand new (long block?) for $1650.00 &gt;&gt;

 Is the estimate that you were given based on a tear down analysis of of the 
engine or are they basing it on the engine sound. Also those estimates seem a 
little odd. They want to charge you 1572.00 to rebuild completely but charge 
you even more for a short block? Also I don't understand how they are doing 
their pricing when they are selling you a new engine, (which I assume will 
include installation)for 1650 when the engine itself will cost them at least 
1200 .At that rate they sure aren't getting much for labor or much of a mark 
up on the engine, but when you turn around and look and thier rebuild quote 
it looks like they're quite proud of thier rebuilds? 
  Another route I'm not sure wheter you considered was buying a good running 
used engine,if you can locate one.These,many times come as complete turn key 
engines. If you went that route you could have your engine tore down to get a 
better idea of what exactly needs to be redone, and I'll bet the rebuild cost 
would be dramatically lower than what you are being quoted now.
