Dale, as I've already posted to Jan, he could have traveled the 32 miles to
Deland, Fl, for example, and seen our 6 type 2's and a whole raft of other
bus folk. He needs to consider Boulder?...get serious!

Still wondering if anyone in Western NC is heading for Pigeon Forge this
weekend. Or Dave E or any other PST members going?

Marv Krupp..who's yet to find a state that doesn't have some wonderful
spots. And some concrete.
