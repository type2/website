Well gang, all good things must come to an end.  I have enjoyed this list
very, very much, but the shear volume of posts has become quiet over whealming
for my tired old brain.  I just can't find time to read it all and find that I
end up deleteing quite a lot of posts, including real inportant stuff that's
been set to my personally.  Good luck and good bye is not forever!
      Peace, Love, and Springs comming anyway--I need to work on buses instead
of reading about them!
