Subject: Deluxe Definiton?

What exactly would a deluxe be in a bay window?

I always thought that the non campers had the chrome trim on the beltline
and the later Westy's had the full stove/sink cabinet but after that I don't
know.  Correct me if I am wrong just curious...

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
Snoopy
