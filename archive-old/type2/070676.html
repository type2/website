Hi,

I would like to see that ad as well. I can direct you to a few places 
on the Internet that you can find some great ads, brochures and 
owners manuals.

www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/  select type 2 and the rest is self explanatory.

www.vanagon_dot_com you might have to hunt around but they have al lot of 
the Life magazine ads from the 60s and 70s.

www.type2_dot_com/~dworkin/ There you will find a scan of the 1975 westy 
owners manual and an advertising brochure.

If anyone knows of anymore let me know and I will put them on the TRG.
