Subject: Electrical Short 

Hi All,

I haven't posted for awhile because I'm getting good
at basic machanics. However when it comes to electical
shorts that's another story. I have one that's causing
a random missfire. It's constantly throughing the
points and timing out of wack!!!  But I'm feeling
intimidated by about finding this short.

I sort of get how to check for them: I have a test
light and full wiring digram, every manual including
Bently.  Have 72 bus retro-fitted with 76 FI
Drivetrain.

But my trouble is the overwhelmingness of it all.  I
feels like looking at a garage full of junk and
wondering where the $#_at_* do I start!

So, any ideas on how to do this? Where do some of you
start? One end of the digram, one end of the engine
compartment?  I feel if I can just get started
somewhere and in an organized fasion I'll be okay. I'm
a girl (woman) and need a ciber hug and some moral
support, oh and yah some practical
electical/mechanical advice. Any help you can give
would be greatly appreciated.

I'll be waiting with my wiring digram and test light
in hand...

Thanks,

Rae
