&gt; 1. An information problem. &quot;I broke down, who can help me?&quot; We can
address
&gt; this pretty easily through an opt-in guestbook type script. It only
needs a
&gt; czar, we'll give you plenty of technical help/webspace but we won't
be in
&gt; charge of it.
&gt; 
&gt; Note: If you consult Steve Dolan at the end of his trip you may find
that
&gt; finding Internet access became just as important as finding honest
&gt; mechanics/friendly listees. You can get it at Kinko's but is ain't
cheap.
&gt; You can get it at some public libraries, but not most. I think
&quot;access&quot;
&gt; deserves its own category, along with &quot;mechanics&quot; and &quot;friendlies&quot;.
If I
&gt; get in trouble on the road I do not want a mechanic and I do not want
&gt; somebody to commiserate, I want access to the type2 list and I want
it now.

I find public libraries to be useful, particularly with a web-based
freemail account.  As you say, libraries are variable with their level
of access.

&gt; 2. A money problem. &quot;My engine blew up and now I can't get home&quot;. I
am so
&gt; torn. Hooper is the very last person who can EVER dispute the
generosity of
&gt; the list. But he is a skeptic through and through so he has to ask
this:
&gt; 
&gt; Say we rack up $1250 or so in donations, of which $100 will be mine.
Some
&gt; listmember-in-good-standing puts a rod through his case in Death
Valley
&gt; while on vacation so we buy him a new AVP longblock. Everybody feels
groovy.
&gt; 
&gt; But then the money is gone, and the breakdowns don't stop, and
somebody
&gt; else blows an engine, and the *second* time you ask people for another
&gt; donation two weeks later, they are going to get awfully quiet. And the
&gt; third time they are going to ask you, why should it work here if it
don't
&gt; work in North Korea?

I agree.  While I have done my share of bailing out folks, I tend to
feel that if you are going to travel about the country you should
expect to pay for your own repairs.  The list should be concerned with
providing access to services, not paying for the services.  In certain
cases, we may pass the hat for a deserving person, but this should not
be expected in every case.  

If a listee wishes to assist me, I will be most grateful and will
thank them profusely, but I should not think of their assistance as
being my right or of providing assistance as their obligation.  

On the other side of the coin, I do my best, but sometimes I just have
to say &quot;Sorry, but I cannot provide further help to you.&quot;  I'll help
someone chase down an ignition coil, but a complete rebuild is beyond
my ability to assist.

If we keep money out of the program, I see no reason why this program
wouldn't work worldwide, as long as there are enough listees to cover
a given region.
