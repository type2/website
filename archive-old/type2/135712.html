Subject: Animal Control

The talk of rodents got me thinking...

What about cats?

Apparently at some point in the recent past a cat had gotten into my
bus and pissed all over. I didn't notice a bad smell until the big
rains lately. I still have some leaks, and the water seems to have
activated the smell of cat piss in my NEW carpet.

It was so bad that my leather jacket fell off the back seat onto the
floor and now reeks of cat piss. I'm having to treat it with Nature's
Miracle (only stuff that works on cat piss IMHO) which really sucks
because it's a nice leather jacket. :-(
