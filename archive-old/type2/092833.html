Hello,
I have been going over the receips for my bus recently, so I know
what I might be due for soon. It looks like in 1988 the PO put a new
motor, or maybe just heads, on the bus.
The receipt shows two items, both at a cost of $747.29
The part numbers are :
VWA 039100031D/1 ;VWA 039100031D/2; The description is :
New 2.0 75/79; New 2.0 75/79
There is also a receipt for installing a customers motor, for about $400. So
I guess it was a new motor, but why the two part numbers?

...................I am guessing (mainly from the price) that the numbers 
represent new heads, right and left, for a 2 liter engine that would be 
applicable for any such engine built between 1975 and 1979.  They might 
cost about $370 each, new, today. They probably have hydraulic lifters. It 
would have been appropriate to replace the heads at 130,000 miles. I doubt 
that the owner got an entirely new motor for $747.29  But for $400, he 
could have had someone pull the motor, inspect it, and put on new heads, 
then replace the motor in the vehicle.

Anyway, it was put in about 44,000 miles ago. The bus has 180,000 miles on
it now, and I am just wondering what I will need to start having done for a
big trip we are taking later this year. In august, we will be using it on
our honeymoon for a month long trip through the mountains/etc.
I know it has hydraulic lifters, so I don't have to adjust those, but are
there any maintenence things that I should have done to a &quot;new&quot; motor at
around 44,000 miles?

.....................Give it a thorough tune-up: New spark plugs, points, 
condenser, air filter, oil filter, fuel filter.  Change the oil. Replace 
the alternator belt. Have a nearly new battery in there and replace the 
wires and fittings on the terminals.  Make sure all 5 tires are new or only 
a few years old, and are correct for that vehicle's weight.....reinforced 
sidewalls, &quot;D&quot; range, see recent posts about correct tires. Have brake pads 
and rotors checked to assure excellent brakes. Be sure the tie rods are not 
worn, and that the front axle isn't going to let you down. Get it 
inspected.  Be sure you have a working jack and can fit the jack into the 
jack points, and are prepared to change a tire. Those jack points may be 
swollen shut with rust. And carry a cell phone that will keep you in 
contact with the world, in case of an emergency. And also listen to others 
who will add some items to your list.

Thanks for any thoughts, suggestions, or general tomfoolery...
