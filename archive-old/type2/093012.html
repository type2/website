Subject: Re: [T2] I guess it's not wrong after all

It should be noted that a Porsche 901 trans is not going to make your bus 
cruise effortlessly at 75mph by itself.  Mike's tranny is backed up by a 
Porsche engine that is making ~50% more power than the average baywindow 
engine.  With a stock motor all that a tall 5th gear (or a tall 4th gear 
for that matter) is going to do is reduce your mpg and cause you to 
overheat your engine.  My 2 cents.

&gt;Thank you, Mike. I bookmarked that. I was also suspicious about the
&gt;practicality of anything that has such a high acceleration in second gear.
&gt;When you have this tranny re-geared, are you doing the work yourself or
&gt;having it done for you? I'd like to know how that works out.
&gt;Right now I am considering having a transmission rebuilt with two 3rd and
&gt;4th gears from a Vanagon just for the '71 transporter/Westphalia conversion.
&gt;But I have to admit that I am sorely tempted by the thought of a 5th gear.
&gt;Thanks for sharing this, and congratulations on your success! Jan B
