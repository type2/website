Subject: Re: [T2] best rubber for sliding window on my 78

I was a full time vendor for over 25 years, actually in the
beginning manufacturing, importing and generally providing window and body
rubber for Type 1s and Type 2s.  I actually manufactured the side window
seals along with others.  Then I started carrying other parts as well.

WCM issues aside, I have installed them all.  And all of the side wdw
seals are a PITA to install because of the shaping of the opening flange as
opposed to the rear and windshield seals.  The shaping on the side window
opening flange is such that the extrusion must &quot;collapse&quot; properly.  Thus,
the extrusion must must have a small hollow airspace to allow for the proper
collapse so that the rubber seals properly and holds the glass (or in your
case, the sliding window frame,) in place without popping out.  Even with
the &quot;hollow&quot;, a lot of oommpphh has to be used when pushing the
seal/assembly in from the outside and a friend is inside pulling the cord
for the inner lip to flop over the flange.  Patience is the key word for
these.

When the first repros were made (by someone who I will leave un-named,) they
were solid.  It was essentially the same solid extrusion for the Rear
Window, just cut &amp; spliced to the proper length.  They didn't poperly test
the seals into the vehicle and people were complaining that while it fit the
frame (or glass) it wouldn't install properly.  There was a few thousand
bucks down someone's drain.  They finally figured out that gee....there's a
hollow airspace for compression.  Problem solved.  Both WCM's and WWest's
are properly made in this fashion AFAIK.

&gt; Hmm... well, if that's true, which wouldn't be a huge deal, I guess it's
&gt; down to WW or the OE Mexico seals - I'm ruling out WCM because I've
&gt; heard too many issues w/ them already.
&gt;
&gt; Jim,
&gt; How would you rank the quality of the seals that you have vs the WW
&gt; seals?  I don't know if you're a vendor or an individual with an extra
&gt; pair, but I figured you might be able to comment on the quality of the
&gt; seals.  I don't mind spending more one way or another, I just don't want
&gt; to do the job twice, ya know?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Mike
