Whaddayaknow!

After list members' sage advice, perusing the wiring diagrams, instructions,
and a not small amount of prayer, I got up under the dash (a saga in itself)
and located the red battery wire and the black-on-red ignition-to-solenoid
wire.  At least I sincerely hoped that's what they were...

Then I nicked each of the wires and used my multimeter to confirm that the
red one was the hot lead from the battery.  I tested the other by hitting
the key, and yes, the ignition he is dead.

But what to do?  I couldn't get to the FLAPS, and had no appropriate parts
on hand.

But I did have a heavy duty power cord from an old PC... and the power
switch from the same computer... hmm...

Cut the ends off of the cord and securely soldered one wire each at one end
to the lugs on the switch.  Concerned about the amps running through the
switch, I soldered the wires across both lugs at either end of the switch's
throw to spread the current across the entire switch (half/half).  Then used
8' of electrical tape to wrap up the switch...

That done, I carefully stripped some insulation from each of the target
wires, added the new wires, taped it up well, put on a leather glove (hey,
it's my first time) and pushed the switch.  BINGO!

The computer switch will need replacing, as it's a push-on/push-off and I
don't want to engage the starter and leave it on inadvertently, BUT, I do'ed
it! :O)

Thank you, you dear, dear people.
