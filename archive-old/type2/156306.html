&gt; There will be plenty of pain when you use gasoline to light the bbq.
&gt; Don't be foolish. Gasoline flashes off quickly it isn't of much use to
&gt; light charcoal. It's dangerous. And there are better products for
&gt; parts washing.

Lots of things in life are dangerous.  With a proper amount of caution you
can safely use gasoline to light fires and wash parts.  Without proper
caution you can kill yourself with &quot;safe&quot; charcoal lighter and &quot;safe&quot;
cleaning solvent.  Ask any emergency room doc.

 &gt; &gt; Like I said before, this things works great!

It won't turn stale or liquid-contaminated gas into fresh gas.  No matter
what the cost, discard the old gas.  It's not worth recontaminating the
system.
