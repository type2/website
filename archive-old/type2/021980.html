  I have been in business for over ten years and have just recently went to
the web. There are many vendors out there and 90% of all parts come from
just a few importers. Bus Depot, Bus Boys, Wolfgang, Wolfsburg West, BFY,
Old Volks of Az/Type2parts_dot_com, all sell basically the same product. It's
all about SERVICE and what you expect. Bus Depot has low prices, the rest of
us work in the standard realm of things.
  I am a 2 person store, ship daily, am personally always available to
answer questions, WILL NOT sell a product I feel is not good and have no
problem referring people to who would have a part in stock that I don't
have.
  My inventory is small compared to some, we keep an average of 2500
different items in stock and this is for 
67 and earlier buses, have some stuff for up to 71 buses (including 8 parts
buses) and a lot of crossover bug stuff (mainly for walk ins).
  The point is BUY from who you like, Bus Depot has been around for a while
and is an asset to the bus community, especially late model stuff. When I
get a phone call or inquiry for a late bus part it's easier for me and more
time efficient for me to refer them to a vendor that might have the part
they need, Generally Bus Boys and Bus Depot, but if it's a Split Window bus
part new or used I generally have it in stock or will in a day or
2.Eventually we will expand to later bus parts. We always give a SHIP date,
either same day or with-in 2-3 days, only product shipped is billed and we
Do-Not drop ship product as I like to personally inspect all product leaving
my store.
   So in defense of Ron/Bus Depot if you like them use them, if you don't go
somewhere else, or use mutable vendors, that way you'll be in favor with
them all so when you need that special little part they will help you get
it.
