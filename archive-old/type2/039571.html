Subject: Re: CV joint 1/2shaft compatible with 76

Bill,
If you are committed to tearing down your 1/2shaft, far be it from me to 
deter you from this path. However, may I offer a suggestion? You might try 
simply removing the shaft and adding some moly-base grease to the joint. If 
you first thoroughly clean the dirt off the outside of the flange, you may 
even get away with not having to clean the old grease off. My '75 did the 
same thing last year, clunked, only it was going forward rather than in 
reverse as with yours. I belatedly learned that the joints need to be 
greased every 30,000-60,000 miles depending upon duty/driving conditions. 
The Owner's manual had failed to list this p.m. task in the mid-70 models, 
so those who do their own might have experienced premature failure 
unnecessarily.
As pointed out by others here recently, the CV's are very rugged, and if 
they haven't gone too far without sufficient grease, there is a good chance 
that that is all you'll need to do. I just drove 2200 miles without a peep; 
the last similar trip was interrupted by horrendous thumping which I could 
cure temporarily by raising the wheel and rotating it by hand with the joint 
at maximum flexion. This seems to redistribute what grease is left for a few 
100 miles until I got home. It was then that I realized that the coating of 
crud on the outside of the flanges was really supposed to be inside the 
boot. It had slowly leaked out over the years.
Good luck,
Roland Finston
