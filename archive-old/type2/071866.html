   How do we know when the distributor itself is shot? You really only hear
about having to replace caps and rotors, and not so much the dizzy
itself...except via tales of modification, etc...
  I'm wondering if there's a common visual inspection that might offer a gauge
on the condition of the device itself.
   Muir's illustration of its shaft is squarish, and I recall yesterday as I
fiddled with the points and rotor, noticing that mine seemed roundish...
   Just curious!
   I will be replacing the rotor and points and condenser before it comes to
this, but since you don't hear much mention of a dead dizzy, and mine is
funking things up, I thought I'd throw it out there.
Again, thanks All*
Rachel
