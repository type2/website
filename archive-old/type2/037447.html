Subject: Clutch cable saga

All,

Clementine Two is now mobile again .. spent last Sat. cleaning out the clutch
cable conduit with a combo of liquid Drano (CAREFULLY applied via a small
syringe), hand Gunk and some good old-fashioned elbow grease.  Turned out the
problem was a leftover cable strand from a previous cable that was jammed in
the tube.  Slid the new cable in, got 'er all adjusted and MAN, what a
difference!!  Causes me to ponder whether the clutch had been releasing
completely with the previous cable .. again, thanks for the help.
