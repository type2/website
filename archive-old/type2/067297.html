Subject: Bad experience w/ California Gas (none VW content)

I bought a 96 Chevy Astro van earlier this year for my wife.  It has =
been in for service 5 times this year because of California's new gas.  =
The fuel injectors for some reason do not like this gas.  After =
complaining to Chevy, they gave us a 5 year/100k extended warranty for =
our troubles.  We wanted them to replace the vehicle,  but we were told =
we would probably have the same hassles with the replacement.  Has =
anyone had this problem?

As for my 67 bus,  I've got to put it back together first. :)
