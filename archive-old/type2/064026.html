Well I admit.  Those times I've been driving in Texas I've been mostly on my way
to some other place.  Like up 80 miles Amarillo on my way from Louisiana to
Colorado and Broke a fan belt.  Couldn't find the spare so hitched into
Amarillo...got a ride in a gas guzzling pontiac with a bad carb...wouldn't go
over 20 mph on the hills and cruised at 30 on the flats.  Texas seems big at 30
mph...Got back with the new belt and THEN found the spare......Once drove  over
a hundred miles out in west Texas around Van Horn  at 15 MPH with a retread that
lost all but one chunk of tread...bump bump bump  Texas seems REALLY big at 15
MPH..

But like I say I'll admit Texas must have a lot of great stuff.  I guess I've
always had my vision focussed elsewhere.    John Jensen in Annapolis...
