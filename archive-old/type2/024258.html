&gt; Doug,
&gt;   How about providing the location measurements for where your
&gt; access hole is that you cut for the fuel sender? What year is your bus...
&gt; 
&gt; I drilled a hole in the floor above the tank looked through it  to establish
&gt; where the sender was, then cut a hole in the floor above the sender,
&gt; 
&gt;               Thanks,
&gt;                     Daniel Axel Simmons

I just did this last week on my '72, it was far easier than I expected.  I used the measurements MICHAEL G BENTHIN provided in a 1996 post.

31.77 inches from driverside and 35.15 inches from the verfy back of the rear deck (with the door open) -- I drilled a half inch hole (careful when you drill, but you got about 5 inched or so before you hit the tank)and I was  right on top of the sender.  I used a nibbler to cut the rest of the hole--just big enough to get the sender out.  On the '72 and earler the sender is smaller than the '73 later and a little easier to replace.  Unfortunatley I thought my sender was larger because one of favorite part places sent me the sender for the later model instead of the '72 and ended up cutting a larger hole than needed.

Good Luck
