I recently had this problem in my 72, we determined it was the alternator and
voltage regulator after having both tested. Replaced both. The battery is
brand new. Had it tested too just in case, battery was fine.

Now it starts up great, as soon as I turn the key.  I used to have to wait a
couple of seconds before it would catch.

May the four winds blow you safely home ;^)
