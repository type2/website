Subject: Flipping middle seat-can mirror image be found in US??

Since my daughter wants to keep the middle seat and still put in a pull 
out westybed into the 75 bus, we'd like to flip the middle seat 180 deg
and make the walkthrough a climb-over, but the armrest is a problem (cut
it off?)...I'd like to source an English version using the mirror image
arm rest....we'd consider getting just the arm part that could be welded
to our seat?
