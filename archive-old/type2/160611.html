Subject: Re: [T2] Water Fuel

OK, I know that I am opening up a can of worms but a
friend and I are going to look into building both a
water fuel and air engine for a Type II.  First we
will try it on a mower and progress if it looks
hopeful.

Then Robt said:  &quot;Stan . . . Please do not confuse the habitual candour of
science &amp; engineering with rudeness.&quot;


Robt, I am sitting here, waiting for the other shoe to drop ! ! !

Isn't it about now that you say &quot;Stan, not to be rude, but you have proven
and disproved two axioms of human nature; one- there's a sucker born every
minute, and two - there is no such thing as a dumb question.&quot;

scamp.  Best wishes and all that....)
