Subject: [t2]Rebuilt engine still stalls

So I just got my brand spankin new engine back from
the shop and low and behold, I'm still having problems
with it.  The guy said it would be rough, since it
still needs to be tuned, but it's not even drivable. 
Here's the predicament:  I'll be driving along, and
the engine will start to slow down (feels like it did
when it seized) and no matter how much gas I give it,
it refuses to speed up.    If I put it in neutral, it
stalls out completely.  Then, once it's stalled out,
it refuses to start.  I think the reason for that is
that I've flooded the engine from giving it too much
gas, but the first part has got me perplexed.  Any
ideas??
