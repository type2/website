Hi Matt, I wonder, when you say that the motor does'nt turn, doe's it just
'click' when you turn the key? if it doe's it probebly means that your
starter motor is faulty, if this was the case it would only happen some of
the time, due to a 'black spot' on the bendix.

&gt; Hey VW'ers,
&gt;
&gt; My 1976 westy is acting up. Sometimes after a long period of driving...ie:
2
&gt; hours or more my van will not start. Usually I am on the road for a few
&gt; hours then stop to gas up. When I go to start again nothing. The motor
does
&gt; not turn, there is nothing. The batteries are fully charged. I can jump
&gt; start the van and it will run fine. If i were to leave the van sit for
&gt; awhile it would start after cooling down. I'm not really sure what to look
&gt; for? Any sugestions? Any similar problems?
&gt;
&gt; Matt
&gt;
&gt; 1976 Westy
