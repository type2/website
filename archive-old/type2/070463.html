Way back when, no-one knew that these old vans would be precious.  They were
cheap useful transportation for people who had a little imagination and more
than a little willingness to put in a bit of time with a tool box.
The standard tailpipe was OK but tended to break off if one of the
(expensive)brackets was left off (as it usually was.   Besides,  If you painted
flames around the hole in the bumper it looked kind of cool.  Hey!  Dual
exhaust!
