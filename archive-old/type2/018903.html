Subject: My new 81 / Mayo / Oil PSI / Carpet
Message-ID: &lt;37FE3AEB.9DF33B11_at_northcoast_dot_com&gt;

So I've been thru the archives reading all about the oil Mayo problem
that I seem to be having, but i have a bunch of other questions about my
New (to me) '81 Westfaila (sadie).

Some background on the car:  Mostly stock 2l FI, Manual trans, 165k
miles (rebuilt 95k, new heads just 10k ago) using Castrol GTX 20-50 in
way way Northern California (costal, Eureka!) where everything except
mold is moderate.

As an aside, I used X-14 to do my poptop, and it worked magic!!  Now I
just have to get up the money to seal the fiberglass.  Has anyone ever
done this at home?  What did it take?  Would it be worth my while to
have a body shop do it?  I am a poor student (who has no more loan left,
after getting a $3000.00 car, DMV, etc) so any help on the cheap would
be great.

Next, when I start up the Vanagon I have oil pressure up to 80 (which
tops out the gauge) and stays up there for a long time.  After about 10
minutes of highway driving at 60 mph, I get down to 60 PSI, idle at 25
or 30.  Never have I seen it below 25.  Is this too high?  When I'm
trucking over to school I don't go below 60 on the highway ever.  The
temp never gets that hot either.  i've seen it at 200 (F) once or twice.

But here is the kicker!  When I stop after that 15-20 min drive down the
highway I _always_ smell burnt oil.  it doesn't seem to be that much,
because if i put down cardboard there isn't a drop on it.  I'm not sure
where it's leaking from, but the very bottom of the engine seems to have
fresh oil on it all the time.

I'm thinking about changing oil weight and / or company to get rid of
the Mayo (i've read that Valveoine seems to be a good bet) and am
wondering what I should put in there.  Will a lower weight (like just
30, or maybe 10-40) lower the pressure any?  Would that help with the
oil smell?

I'm now an expert at data mining the type2 web page, but I just couldn't
find a straight answer on these questions.  (aside: I would love a
&quot;follow up&quot; link so when I find a question like the one I have I could
read any answers that people posted.  it seems it would be possible as
the full headers are there.  I would love to donate my perl skills to
the list, but I'm not sure what sort of program does the searching in
the first place.)

Other question:  The carpet isn't stuck to anything around the front
bucket seats and wheel wells.  What should I use to stick it?   Again,
cheap is the key.

Thanks in advance.  I love this list and wish it health and long life!
