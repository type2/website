&gt; Last question for friday. Is there the equivalent of a fuel mixture

&gt; what does it relate to?

Yes, the &quot;CO adjusting screw&quot; is affecting the mixture.  It is a bypass
adjustment which determines the fuel/air ratio at idle.

Is this a California (O2 sensor) or Federal (no O2 sensor) model?
