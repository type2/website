Subject: Wrenches for triple-square or &quot;serrated&quot; head bolts

There are a couple places and sizes of socket-head screws on buses, so I
have a set of wrenches that I bought a bit back (OK, John anderson has it,
but I bought it).  They are made by lisle and cover the two that are
common on VW's as well as two others.  If you are interested, you can see
them at http://www.tools-plus_dot_com/lis-wrenches--serrated-.html.  Not a
recommendation of this vendor... there are probably available from others
locally or from one or more of the vendors on the list.
