Hi everyone.  I've been off the list for a while, as my bus had a blown plug 
for months until I finally found someone to reinsert it (in #2 plug hole).  
I immediately replaced my starter/solenoid as it had been giving me 
troubles, and installed a hard start relay.  In the heat of the garage, I 
ignored the tag on the bushing, and didn't put the new bushing in, too.  It 
was actually the solenoid that was bad, but replaced starter, too.  Anyway, 
is this bad?  Do I have to drop the starter again to put the new bushing in? 
  I now can hear my starter. Is this just from the increased power from the 
relay?


Thanks,
Dustin
