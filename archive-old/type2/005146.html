&gt; &gt; $800?????
&gt; &gt; Let's not make the neophytes nervous.  All you need is a 1-13/16&quot;
&gt; &gt; socket.  3/4&quot; drive is adequate.  Add to that an eighteen inch 3/4&quot;
&gt; &gt; drive T-bar and you have everything you need.  Maybe some scrap pipe
&gt; &gt; for some extra lever arm.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I bought mine at Sears fifteen years ago.  Probably cost less than
&gt; &gt; $30.  With all the import stuff out there, you could probably do
&gt; &gt; better than that today.  I never had to use any violence to remove
&gt; &gt; the big nut.  Just stand on the end of the T-bar, grab on the the
&gt; &gt; body and pull. I weigh about 175 pounds.  No hitting with the sledge
&gt; &gt; hammer required.
&gt;
&gt; I bought a 3/4&quot; drive socket set at a flea market for $37.50. Not super
&gt; quality, but it does get those high-torque nuts, bolts and screws off.
Works
&gt; good for tearing out walls in Butler buildings and removing heating
elements
&gt; from water heaters, too.
&gt;
&gt; I am a Tool Collector of the first order, and not even I want an $800
socket
&gt; set.
