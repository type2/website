Subject: Re: [T2] - Key stuck in ignition..

If steering wheel will turn with key in lock, you don't need to tow 
it-just put a jumper wire from battery + to the ignition + on the coil. 
  This will automatically connect the doublerelay. Push the bus to jump 
it,  or lie underneath and connect the battery big + connector terminal 
to the little spade on the starter (one that kicks the solenoid- and 
away you drive.  The air sucked in the air flow meter will close the 
switch to the fuel pump.
