Subject: Re: [T2] Window Lifter  Regulator Replacement

From: Borough Rae

Is there any tricks anyone has for how to remove the regulator with
out removing the wing window???

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Other than bending the door?
No..... but the vent window is easy to remove. You already have the door window loose and sitting in the
bottom of the door. Now pull down the top window channel at the end where it meets the vent window frame.
There is a clip up there holding it in. Now slide that clip back and it will drop.
Remove the phillips screw up in the channel forward of where the clip was. Get a skinny straight blade
screwdriver and bend the screw tab down a little [you will find out why in a minute or so].
Now remove the 10mm headed bolt at the base of the vent window pivot. Open the vent window. Grab the upright
piece and pull back. The vent window assembly will now come out of the door frame. btw, if you did not bend
down that screw tab......you would know it because the window assembly will stop short just as you pulled.....
All you need to do now is pivot the top of the vent window to the rear and the cable drive will clear the base
of the vent assembly.
