&gt; well found out what the expensive noise was today

finally caught up with friend and he had a stub axle and gave it to me
&quot;Gratis&quot;

Friday when I found out what the problem was it was about 4PM.  quick
called Bus Depot, explained my problem and they said they could try to
send it out next day/Saturday delivery, but UPS had not been very
reliable on Sat deliveries and I would still be responsible for taking the
parts, told em OK, give it a try.

11 AM UPS truck pulls up.  got my bearings from the Depot, got my stub
axle in the afternoon, Sunday Afternoon got under the bus and by 4PM she's
back on the road again.

Thanks to the folks who offered their stubs
and THANKS TO RON AT THE DEPOT, YOU GUYS ARE AWESOME!

and thanks for the karma loan, 
I will gladly repay you tuesday!

&gt; 
&gt; took out my left rear bearings.
&gt; 
&gt; got new bearings coming but just found out the stub axle is damaged
&gt; 
&gt; can't get a hold of my usual sources (suspects)
&gt; 
&gt; in any case, anyone in the mid Atlantic area have a 78 stub axle in decent
&gt; shape handy?????
&gt; 
&gt; thanks
