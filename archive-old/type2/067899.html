Subject: Type III Ghia-Reason for Insanity?

Type IIers (and evidently some Type IIIers too):

My one question about a Type III Ghia prompted some fast offlist
replies.  With urging from Jim, Lon, michael, John, Jeff, Troy
and Bob I called on it an hour ago.  It would appear that people
drool for Type III finds just as much as they do for old buses.

Owner retired, physically unable to work on it, &quot;all there&quot; but
disassembled.  Will see it Saturday morning and (to keep to the
subject of the list) maybe I'll be able to find out what parts a
Type II and a Type III have in common.
