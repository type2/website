&gt; Hey Chris,
&gt; I had to put 2 gaskets on my gas cap to make sure it sealed. My filler neck
&gt; had worn so much I couldn't get a tight seal. I posted about 2 years ago
&gt; when this happened that I actually spun the DC out on a slow left hand turn
&gt; where the gas spilled out onto my right rear tire causing a severe loss of
&gt; traction. The only fix for me was 2 gaskets on the stock cap.

we need a compromise I can hardly get my gas cap on and off sometimes when
the gas jockey put it on tight it is next to impossible to get off.....
