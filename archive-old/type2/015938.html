In the state of Texas &quot;he&quot; does not even have to do that.  If you do not
make good on the bad check, the District Attorney will issue an arrest
warrant, then someday when you least expect it you will find yourself
wearing these nice chrome-steel bracelets.  In most states, the garage can
also place a &quot;mechanic's lien&quot; on your vehicle.
