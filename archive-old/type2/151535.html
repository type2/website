Subject: RE: Clutch ...

Thankyou so much for your help,   I will be jacking the bus up and getting
underneath tommorow .. Someone said in a private mail to &quot;Screw the wingnut
six turns tight&quot; and that if it makes any difference then it's an adjustment
problem ..




&gt;In my experience, clutch release failure is most often due to something in
the &quot;system&quot; that transmits the force from your left foot to the release
bearing.  I would guess a frayed clutch release cable; or accelerated wear
in/around the hook that pulls the cable; or a loose eccentric at the trans
end;
or (most expensively) a broken weld at one of the arms that actuate the
throwout bearing.  Fixing this last case requires engine removal just to
begin
the surgery; but there is often an accompanying noise that gives a clue.&lt;

No Noise .. except the crunch of gears as you try to enguage them ..


&gt; Anything you can do to get an honest diagnosis beforehand will help
you.  Please advise:&lt;
1) Did this problem develop suddenly, or over some weeks/months?&lt;

Weeks/ Months as it got cold in fact ..

&gt;2) Is there any new noise, and if so, how does it relate to pedal
location?&lt;

No obvious noise BUT remember it's a camper so loads of sound deadening ..


&gt;3) Does the pedal feel spongier near the floorboard than it did
previously?&lt;

Not that I recall ..

&gt;4) What's the odo reading; the general condition of the mechanicals; and do
you
know when the clutch was last replaced?&lt;

Well now this make me feel like a bit of an idiot .. .. The mileage is
107,000 and I checked through the mile of paperwork Sophie got with the car
.. new clutch at 89,000 in 1997.    Now I KNOW who drove the last 5000 miles
.. and I met the previous owner and (according to them) they mostly did
trips down to Cornwall in it ..   it's really unlikely that however badly
they treated it anyone could kill a clutch in 17,000 miles ... (My landrover
has 140,000 on the clock and is still taking up in the lower quadrant ..)


Am I wrong or is this looking pretty positive ?

Justin
