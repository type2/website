    Thanks to everybody for the help.  I successfully split my case 
lastnight.  Everything is going well. However, I have encountered a few minor 
problems.  I cannot remove the 6 main studs because of the plastic inserts.  
I tried taking one of the inserts off and it broke in half.  I also have not 
yet been able to remove the main or cam bearings from the case. I have not 
bee able to remove the rod inserts as well.  Those are all my technical 
problems to this point.  Thanks again.
