Describe the process you used to get rid of the
clouding with the hairdryer. I've got a couple
windshield's out that I'd like to try this with.

&gt; removed, but only with
&gt; the windshield removed. We did this on a
&gt; rare/expensive windscreen with a 
&gt; hair dryer,
&gt; followed by resealing the edges.
