Subject: &quot;Apollo 11&quot; - VW Sightings!

Not only did they depict one of the astronauts (Armstrong, I think) driving
a Bug, but there were also some beautiful shots of many Type IIs, including
Westies.

Looked like it was stock footage, which would make them all 1969 and
earlier... probably a bunch of splitties, though I did not have a chance to
see that much detail.

No, no Things on Luna herself...
