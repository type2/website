&gt; #4) 105
&gt; so all were a little low, but #1 seemed

&gt; heard no expensive noises, or???   what should my next

&gt; this is an 1800 w/ a set(2) of AVP heads w/ less than
&gt; 3000 miles on the heads.   mileage on the motor is
&gt; unknown.   when i bought this a little over a year ago
&gt; the compression was about 120+ or - 5 all the way
&gt; around.   ughhhh, guess ill be working hard on this

Before you spend a lot of money check

Valve gap.  
Loose heads.

sounds like it may be a valve not closing.  even with no rings at all I
think you would get at least a little compression.
