Hi David,

&gt;... I was wondering if
&gt; anyone has upgraded to discs on the rear.

 It's been done but I'm not personally convinced
of the benefit.

&gt; I see a lot of busses with smashed
&gt; front ends, and a recent posting by unfortunate Jamey got me interested again.

 Jamey was driving a '68 with FRONT drums-
these need to be in near perfect condition to
be fully effective.

&gt;.. I am lucky to have front discs, I know, but would like all four if
&gt; possible.  Maybe I could snag a pair off a later model vanogan?

 Even the current Eurovans still have drums at
the rear- at least the base models do, anyway.

 The brakes on a bus are excellent, if it's not
loaded down. If you don't have a working
booster (servo) then you might benefit by
getting one but otherwise the limiting factor
will be either your tyres or yourself. If you just
stamp on the pedal in a bus the wheels will
simply lock and you'll slide (and slide and 
slide...until the nose gets crunched).
 To stop quickly you need to let the weight
transfer to the front wheels before you lean on
the pedal. If you do this right you'll be
astonished at how fast your bus will stop (and
so will anyone behind you!). If you have this
dialled then the limiting factor will be how much
grip your tyres generate (Light Truck tyres are
made for longevity, not grip).
 If you can get to the stage where you are
pushing on the brake pedal with all your might
and the wheels won't lock- Then you need
better brakes. The stock discs, with a booster,
will do fine unless you're hammering down a
long hill in a loaded van.

 Hope this is helpful and not too &quot;preachy&quot;.
Remember that ABS was introduced because
most people don't know how to brake properly
and many panic even if they do: a bus doesn't
have it so you need to do the job.

Cheers,
             W.
