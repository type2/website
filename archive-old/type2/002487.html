Subject: timing,  i know i know... bear with me here, its painless :)

Ok... after a couple hours dredging the archives I have 1 last question
before I am content with my timing... heres a little background for those
who have been quick to delete my last couple posts:

80 Westy 2.0 L (6000 miles on it)
weber progressive carb, 009 dizzy

alright, all I need to know is what the stock total advance is for my engine
(i.e. with stock F.I. and dizzy). All the numbers in my manuals are for
baseline (7.5 BTDC) and I need to know what the total advance was with the
stock setup... thanks. [man, that was one redundant sounding paragraph, go
ahead read it again :) ]
