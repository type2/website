Subject: Re: [T2] TUG and then a leaky 30 PICT-1

Does anyonwe know of a bearing retrofit for Solexes? I have yet to see
that done.

&gt; With old carbs either you need a larger throttle shaft to match the larger worn throttle shaft hole or find a tighter less worn carb. I have a buddy that rebuilds Corvair carbs often. He has a selection of bodies and shafts and mixes and matches to find a tight combo. He says the shafts wear faster than the carb bodies. Dunno if that applies to VW's but it should b/c I think the materials are the same. 
&gt; 
&gt; Lastly - you could bore out the ends of the shaft holes to a slight depth to fit an 'O' ring on each end of the shaft.
