Subject: [T2] Bucking, Top Cot
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

Once again I want to thank you guys for all the help- I hope I can help
somebody on here someday as well!

I'm at present awaiting sunlight to replace my starter,  after weeks of
doodling with a starting problem and fixing other items along the way
(stretched alt. belt, poor battery grounding)  and I still have to get the
SOB who put on my CV boots to do it over as both passenger side boots have
come loose.

Otherwise----I noticed as I limped my baby home tonight that it bucked a lot
(never before) in third- even accelerating at around 35!!!  Any ideas (it is
F/I)????

Also- how difficult is acquiring the top cot equipment for a '72??  All of
the hardware is missing.

Thanks again,
Wade
