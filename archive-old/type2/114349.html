&gt; (Whatzit?) 0.5&quot; thick flat tool about 6&quot; long x 3&quot; wide w/square 0.5&quot; 
&gt; hole
&gt; centered on the square-shaped end and what appears to be a 34-36mm hex 
&gt; hole
&gt; centered on the oval-shaped end.  Square end of tool has been pounded 
&gt; to
&gt; rotate hex hole end.

Sounds like an axle bolt removal tool.  You put the oval end on an axle 
bolt and pound the square end with a sledge to loosen tough axle bolts. 
  You can even use your 1/2 socket or breaker by putting them in the .5 
inch square hole.  That's quite an impressive tool score - Good Luck :)
