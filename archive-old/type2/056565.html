Subject: fubar, part 1

how in the **** do you remove the handbrake cable from the backing plate on
the rear brake?  ive got the cable loose every where else but cant get that
sheath type thing off the backing plate.  the cables fine, but the sheath
is so rusted cracked that the spring on the back wont return the cable back
to normal.  muir and bentley both say to remove a locknut.  ive looked and
looked but cant find one.  haynes and chilton say remove the clip.  again
where is it?  its a 69 westy for reference.

also is it possible to buy just the rubber hose type thing that goes from
the tube to the backing plate without the cable or does a new cable come
with this part?

thanks
