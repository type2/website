&gt;I think I have the same relay kit.  Does it reach the starter terminals 
&gt;ok?

I bought my Bosch WR-1 kit from Bus Depot. The wires were long enough and not tight. The only hard part was fitting the spade terminals through the grommet (not that hard really).

&gt;There's a wire on the double-relay that goes to the starter. If you  
&gt;put the starter button over there then there's nothing to worry about  
&gt;during an engine drop.
&gt;
&gt;Bonus: The double-relay is much easier to access than the regulator  
&gt;if the bus is loaded full of camping gear....

True but you often want a remote starter that doesn't cause fuel to be sprayed so it's a little extra effort to configure it for both cases.
