Marko,
Because it catches, you clearly have fuel and spark. There would be no harm 
in trying to adjust the timing by 5 degrees either way from where you have 
it now (set at cranking speed); you can only do damage at high rpm or under 
load with way out timing. Is it possible that the idle screw is turned too 
far in? (But stepping on the pedal would correct that). My thinking is that 
because you have white smoke, you just don't have a good fuel/air mixture. 
How about a recheck of all the hoses that supply air to or take vacuum from 
the air distribution manifold on the down stream side from the AFM? Any 
significant gap in that system would allow unmeasured air in, and cause a 
lean condition that would not sustain an idle. Is it possible that the wires 
on the distributor cap are off by 90 degrees? Just some thoughts...
Roland
