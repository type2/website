Subject: Transmission fluid change

Greetings B.Ps,
I've been catching up on Willemina's annual maintanance, and am shocked and 
confused regarding the transmission fluid. My Bentley manual says &quot;It is 
unnecessary to change the hypoid oil on 1970 and later vehicles, unless the 
oil has become contaminated.....&quot; Willemina is a 75. I'm tempted to ignore 
this advice and go with my better judgment. Does anyone have an opinion 
either way?
Thank-you much

Mike 75 Westy &quot;Willemina&quot;
