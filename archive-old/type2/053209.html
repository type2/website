Subject: Re: pilot bearing  sticking vs disk sticking?

(Responding to Matt Freeman, who did notice noise before his pilot
bearing failed)
   Forgot to tell you about a symptom that happened after I did that
disk replacement at 150K (forgot to grease bearing.....; it was 65K
miles ago!  We were in a campground out in Montana, and it was a cool,
foggy morning.  I believe I pushed the clutch in and started the car-
and it jumped forward (I thought something was wrong with cable or
adjustment. No, we later figured this had to be either the disk &quot;bound&quot;
to release plate or flywheel, or the inputshaft somehow bound to the
pilot hole.  In neutral, it started fine and should, because even if the
input shaft is welded to the pilot hole, the engine will just turn the
shaft- but you can't get it into any gear. Luckily, I broke it free by
really setting the brakes and then turning it over.  Since then I have
developed the habit of going into neutral at lights instead of sitting
on the clutch, which makes both the release bearing AND the pilot
bearing spin.
   The latest (still rare) symptom of acting like it's grabbing now and
then when clutched (in gear) again suggests a sticking pilot bearing or
one that's letting the disk wobble and grab the flywheel or plate now
and then?
Indeed, I get shuddering on letting out the clutch in lots of stop and
go traffic, but just push the clutch in and let it out again and it
works.
