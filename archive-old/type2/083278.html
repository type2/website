Subject: GoWesty Alloy Wheel Package

Has anyone on the list tried the GoWesty 15&quot; alloy wheel package?  They are
currently selling it with Michelin Rainforce tires.  They have a load
rating of 95 and 1510 pounds but only 35 psi.

I have a standard '76 Bus so it is relatively light.  I currently have the
Yokohama 356 LT tires with a load rating of C and 1600 pounds at 50 psi.
It still feels squirrely, especially in crosswinds.  Aside from the load
rating, has anyone with this set up reported any improvement due to the
shorter sidewalls?
