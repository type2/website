Subject: I'm back!!

Hi all!  After a 2 week absence from the list, I am once again &quot;hooked up&quot;.  I 
moved from San Antonio, TX to Colorado Springs 2 weeks ago.  Loaded up most of 
my garage stuff in my 58 single cab, Zorm, and all my clothes and a few 
personal items in my 73 Westy and my wife and I headed out.  Kinda cool being 
able to have your very own bus caravan!  We drove to Amarillo, TX the first day 
and left Zorm in my parents care until I have a house to call my own up here.  
Then the next day we continued on with just the 73.  

Somewhere along the line I must have pissed off the oil god.  Zorm started 
leaking oil (worse than usual) just out of San Antonio and I had to top him off 
with 1/2 qt of oil every 200 miles.  Then, while traversing the Raton, 
NM/Trinidad, CO pass the 73 started leaking too.  Seems to be mostly from the 
valve cover, but 2 attempts at reseating/replacing the gasket hasn't seemed to 
help much.  Oh well, I'll get it figured out eventually.

I met up with fellow listee Dave Russel here in CO.S. and he graciously invited 
me to use his garage to check out the oil leak.  I think if I asked him if I 
could rebuild the whole bus there, he'd say OK to that too.  Really great guy 
and I'm looking forward to doing bus stuff with him.

Anyway, sorry if I've bored most of you with this nearly pointless rambling, 
but I just wanted to say &quot;Hi&quot; and get my new e-mail address out there to anyone 
who cares to drop me a line.
