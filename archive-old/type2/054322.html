Matthew Santori sends:

&gt; I am currently an owner of a '78 type II Westy, and need to pull the engine
&gt; and tranny. Can they be pulled together in one piece? Need to replace tranny,
&gt; and while I am at it, an engine overhaul wouldn't hurt. Any assistance would
&gt; be nice. particularly, how to get it out. Thanks.

The official VW recommendation says to drop them bolted together then
separate them while they're down. Sounds like a two floor jack and eight (as
John Muir called them) husky loafers job to me, but the party line is that
it can be done.
