Subject: clutch/transmission problem

I recently replaced the clutch and throw-out bearing in my '76 Westy.
After reinstalling the engine I found that the transmission would not
engage any gears (i.e., it appears to be stuck in neutral).  I replaced the
rear shift coupler, performed shift rod adjustment, and adjusted the
clutch, but the problem remains.  Is it likely that I managed to break
something in the transmission nosecone during engine install (I had gears
before replacing the clutch) or could I have damaged the clutch somehow??
where would be the best place to start...

If it seems likely to be nosecone related (hockey stick, selector) where
could I find those parts?

Thanks for any help.

Chris.
