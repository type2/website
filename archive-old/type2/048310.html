Subject: [T2] RE: Tow Dolly

&gt;&gt;I am planning on towing my '77 manual transmission bus about 50 miles on a
&gt;&gt;two-wheeled dolly, and wondered if I needed to do anything to protect the
&gt;&gt;transmission (besides taking it out of gear). Is it better to raise up the
&gt;&gt;front or rear? Thanks for any suggestions.

I have towed busses with dollies on several occasions.  The bus seems to
remain more stable and track straighter when the front wheels are raised.  I
have towed my automatic with the rear wheels raised and it provided a little
more &quot;driving excitement&quot; than I desired.  As far a protecting the manual
transmission you should be fine for only 50 miles.  If you want to be really
safe you could remove the CV shafts but I never have and I have never had a
problem.  Last but not least be very very very careful.  Busses are top
heavy to begin with and when you raise them up on a dolly they become
extremely unstable.  Make certain the tires are properly inflated.  This
makes a world of difference.  Also make certain the brakes on the tow
vehicle are in very good shape.  Stopping the bus will be very difficult.
Make certain to downshift to lower gears if you descend any hills.  My Jeep
is rated to tow 5,000 lbs and a late 70's bus is about all it can safely
handle.  

Good luck,
