IMHO,

Mark Stephens hyped himself to be the best for heads.  AVP uses the same
techniques as MSHP did, and doesnt rape you on the core charges like MSHP
did, and their prices are lower.

I may need heads for an 82 westy i have, and i was in no way considering
MSHP as the supplier.

take care,

Steve
