Subject: Re: [T2] Type 2 is about Type 2's, right?

&gt;From: Christophe Guilbert

&gt;Anyway , I also try to make some joke in this list, some people did not 
&gt;share my sens of humors , they wrote me a personal email without bringing 
&gt;up the all thing to the list, I think that was the way to go !!!


My apollogies to all for the stink and color. I will try to be more Vanilla 
with the postings from here out.

Thanks Chris. I am not saying you agree with me or cared for my posting. But 
I think it is very Hypocritical for some folks to say &quot;this is not Bus 
content&quot;. &quot;I come here for Bus stuff not politics or religious material, 
etc.&quot;  All the while they never mention Bus content. Go figure....

Rules to me were meant to be tested or place an average discilpine otherwise 
we would all be computers living in a binary world. Exactly rwright or 
exactly wrong.


Bus content: The highways where I live have set speed limits but ocasionally 
I have gone over them in a Bus. But this is a rare occasion due to the fear 
that the wrath of law and order will be implimented and my rights might be 
possibly taken away. Either the Bus would break or the driving privilages 
revoked.

List content: I would like to thank publicly, TERRY K. He helped me recently 
in getting some much needed hard to find parts. Thanks again Terry and don't 
let the Dodge drive you away from the Baywindow. ;-)

Thanks,

Michael Knight
