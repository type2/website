&gt;&gt;Ya think I need a new starter?? Or just keep a

Dilligad had this problem...I ran a heavy gauge wire from the positive side
of the starter into the engine bay to bypass the ignition switch.
Make sure to tape the exposed end of the wire while not in use.
TO START:
First, chock your tires as you will be leaving the tranny in neutral.
Second, LEAVE TRANSMISSION IN NEUTRAL   (amhik)
Third, turn key to 'on' position.
Fourth, go to engine bay, untape the wire, and with one hand on the
throttle, (you sure it's in neutral?)touch the wire to the positive (+)
terminal on your battery.(yes it's LOUD...and there will be sparks)

Do not attempt this wearing a tie ;)
