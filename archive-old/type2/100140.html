Subject: Re: [T2] w8cc plugs?

&gt; Autohaus guy told me that the W8CC0 I had expected was a three electrode plug,
&gt; not necessary, and that his shop didn't use them.

From what I've read the best plugs are copper and have only one electrode.
More electrodes just block the flame but unfortunately Bosch marketing folks
are in charge.

&gt; Are &quot;W8CC&quot; okay?

According to this page, it's the right plug to use which is why I put it in:

Steve Dolan told me he runs W8CC in Virginia all year long.  Where has he
got to lately?

I researched plugs in the archives back in August and this is what I found:

&gt; W8's are hotter running plugs for most normal driving conditions as well as
&gt; colder climate and lotsa stop n go traffic.
&gt; 
&gt; W7's are colder running plugs for warmer climates and extended/high rpm
&gt; highway driving. Usually the plug of choice when building those hi-perf motors
&gt; as well because they tend to run a little hotter than stock.

I've also read the W7CC is considered a summer plug (warmer climates), and
W8CC a winter plug.  When I lived in B.C. the VW mechanics there put in W7DC
which is even colder than W7CC but the bus ran fine in that mild climate.

See this library article to see how the numbers fall into the range:
