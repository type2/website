Subject: inner sill repair
Message-ID: &lt;000c01be9a45$251051c0$cf14883e_at_tps&gt;

Hello again, ready for the next job?
    I am currently about to replace my sills.  Ihavegroundback the outer
sill, removed the old (v.rusty) belly pan and examined the disintegrating
remains of the inner sills.  I have bought all the ew bits of tin, but I
can't work out how to get rid of the old inner sill to weld in the new one.
It appears to be spot welded to the cross bus I section, and the floor of
the van.  The spot welds are only clear in a few places.  I am not too
daunted by the task of welding the ew sills in, but can someone tell me how
to get the old inner one (not the inner inner, perforated one) out. Should I
dril throughthespots I can see ad guess for th others?
    Thanks in advance.  For all those who helped me with my centre steering
pin problem, I eventually removed it. Thermal shock hammering etc wouldn't
shift it, so in the end I cut it out.  I will fit the new bushings when I
can be arsed again.
    Also, sorry- can someone tell me what brake fluid I should use when
bleeding the brakes ('72 camper), if it matters.  I haveread the stuff on
the site, but it doesn't specify.
    cheers
        Tristan and Isolde(the 'burgerstar' bay)
