Subject: Re: [T2] gas safety - tank draining saga

Did that too with the same results... Yuck! By the way I prefer the taste 
of Super Unleaded to Leaded... &lt;grin&gt; Probably good I don't smoke.

&gt;So can siphoning gas... by mouth.
&gt;
&gt;I now siphon gas only with clear tubing and a siphon pump.  Well, except in
&gt;emergencies, then I _might_ suck on the tube, if I'm feeling brave and I am
&gt;_very_ desperate.
&gt;
&gt;A very long time ago, I siphoned gas and accidentally got some in my mouth.
&gt;Which isn't so bad IF (I repeat emphatically) IF the swallow reflex doesn't
&gt;kick in before you can spit it out.
&gt;
&gt;I didn't suffer brain damage or anything (I hope), but I burped gas _fumes_
&gt;for three days, and everything I ate and drank tasted like petrol.
