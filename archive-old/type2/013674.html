Possibly...but i doubt that it is causing your problem.  
Esp not with the
pointless ignition installed. It is there to give an 
additional, and more
solid, ground path for the points.
&lt;snip&gt;

On my 74 the same thing happened (with pertronix installed)
and while I dont know if there is supposed to be a path to
ground other than the small strap.... mine will not run
without it. Period. I made my own and replaced the old
one...it worked but also it wore out and was making
intermittent contact as the advance plate moved and I
experienced very strange problems untill I figured it out
again... made another, superior design this time ;-)...
problems went away.
Soooo I would try and fix the ground strap... easy/cheap.
if that doesnt work you arent out much $$$ if it does work
you will have saved yourself $$$.
