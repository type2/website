&lt;&lt;Greetings,

Just did an oil change on my Bus, and part (most of I think) an o-ring came

out with the screen. It is black and my guess is that it would be about 1

1/4&quot; OD if it was complete. Any experienced guesses? Push rod tube seal,

maybe? &gt;&gt;

My guess would be that it's the O-ring off the bottom of your distributor.
