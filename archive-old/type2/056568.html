Subject: Re: List Server Info Needed

I am glad to hear this response.  I really don't want any spam, and I
can't think of any other reason someone would want a list of the list's
members.  If somebody sends me spam, even VW related spam, I tend to
send some nasty grams to the sysadmins at their ISP, which often results
in the spammer's account being closed.  Just a word to the wise - not
everybody seems to know the kind of reaction they are likely to get
to email mass mailings.

-&gt; If all is working as I hope it is, there is no way to get the list of
-&gt; addressee's from the list server.  Neither is it available by asking.
-&gt; If anyone wants to send you their address, they are welcome to do so, but
-&gt; the list of adressee's is strictly private!
