Cassandra,

Sounds like something in your clutch and/or clutch actuation system.
Could be a stretched/frayed clutch cable, or if you are less lucky, a
weakened throwout bearing lever.  While the guys have your engine out,
why not do a first class clutch job, including a regrind of the
flywheel's clutch mating surface?  Shifting a Type II should be a
pleasure..... so you can concentrate on the nice dolly danglers and
the feel of the red velvet covered steering wheel.
