Hello List..

I have heard of people plumbing inside air back into their heating system via
ductwork into the aux air blower mounted atop the engine compartment.  Has
anyone ever tried to plumb a hose from the aux blower down into the tin below
the cylinders to draw air from where there is hot air exiting?  If the engine is
not leaking there really should be minimal or maybe no scent picked up by this
method.  The air exiting the cylinders is nice and warm.  This would almost
certainly increase the temperatue of the air in the heating system.  As long as
the air picked up is not too hot the blower should not suffer any ill effects.
Any thoughts on this? anyone who has tried it?
