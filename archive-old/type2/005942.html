X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL

[...]

If you are truly determined to fabricate your own filler hose, try using
marine exhaust hose material.  It's pretty much bullet-and everything
else-proof, and can be had with wire reinforcing molded in.  It's pretty
pricey stuff, but wouldn't be too bad for a short length.  Gates is the most
commonly encountered brand...

&gt;&gt;  Nope, they are made of different material.  Gasoline will attack
radiator hose, rendering them dangerously brittle in a few months.  &lt;&lt;
