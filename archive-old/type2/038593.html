Subject: 1970 Westy and new engine and trans for sale

Hey everyone a while back i posted to the list about a bus in my area that 
was very interesting and priced at a nice $10,000 (wish i had that much 
money). But anyways the bus was parked on a lot for sale and a guy went off 
the road and hit the bus. The rear drivers side quarter panel got hit. The 
bus is now for sale after all the dealings with the insurance company. The 
price for the bus now is $4,000. Complete great looking bus besides having a 
screwed side. The price includes a extra complete never been in a bus engine 
and trans. Engine is a 1600dp B case. The engine in the bus right now was 
built a while back and does not have many miles on it at all. Bus has many 
neat things on it.

 I will sell the extra engine and trans for $2,000 you can hardly buy a nice 
turnkey engine for that price. 

A picture of the bus can be seen at:

it is a older picture but it looked the same before being in the hit. 

I should have new pictures in a few days or so showing the damaged area. 

If anyone is interested in the bus or engine let me know. It is located in 
Belvidere, IL
Thanks

dan
