&gt; Dear Steven,
&gt; 
&gt; Could you post this message to the type2 list, please?
&gt; 
&gt; Subject: Mid-70s Bus stuff in WI: $1200(?)
&gt; 
&gt; I was a subscriber of the type2 list for several years until late November
&gt; of this past year, when I was seriously burned while working on our 78 Bus,
&gt; Guac. I was attempting to repair a gas leak when the gasoline ignited. Guac
&gt; was destroyed, and our garage as well. Fortunately, we have good insurance,
&gt; and after about a month in the hospital and successful skin grafts on my
&gt; right hand, arm, and shoulder, I am doing much better.
&gt; 
&gt; We have decided to move to a lower-maintenance vehicle.
Boys and girls:
Let this serve as this week's SAFETY REMINDER! The pain in this letter
comes through really clearly.
First let me say how sorry I am to hear of David's fire and to wish him
a speedy and complete recovery from his burns.
Working around gasoline in VW buses is always the time to be really
cautious. One CUP of gas on fire on your hands is a lot of heat- a full
bus tank has 15+ gallons, enough to burn EVERY house on your block.
I've seen  WAY to many burned buses!!
Let me say it again:
1. Move the vehicle outside.
2. Wait till the fuel level is low.
3. Have a fire extinguisher handy AND know how to use it.
4. Disconnect the ground wire at the battery cable.
5. Be really careful where you direct a torch, a heat source, a trouble
light- ANY possible ignition source.
6. Use hose clamp-offs if you possibly can (remember FI engines have 2
fuel line connections to the tank).
7. Maybe most important- as you work, constantly keep thinking about how
this situation might become unsafe- IT'S NEVER A GOOD DAY TO GO TO THE
HOSPITAL!!
I hate it when the list loses a member for any reason- don't let happen
to you!
