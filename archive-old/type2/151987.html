&gt; &gt; I have talked with this guy several times, and seen him driving down
&gt; &gt; the road!  Wild sight!

&gt; Oh, that is just too cool!  Looks like the guy is equipped to give out
&gt; grid squarees to the deserving on 50, 144, 220, 440, 1200 and 2400MHz, all
&gt; without leaving the driver's seat!
&gt;
oh and I thought he hung a tarp over it and used it to hold prayer
