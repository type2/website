Subject: Re: [T2] Uh-oh ... what have I got here?

Thanks Chris,

Here is my dilemma. I have re-torqued the 4 stud nuts to spec and tomorrow
will run another compression test. However, even if I do get good readings,
I still have to assume that the same person who failed to tighten to spec
the four nuts I can access also tightened the four I cannot, so the odds
that they are sitting at some minimum torquage are really good..

Does it matter if the compression is good? Maybe, maybe not. Still it is
going to be difficult for me to consider a long trip without first pulling
the engine and making sure everything is as it should be.

Cheers,

John Rogers

&gt;
&gt; Hopefully this does not mean the studs are pulled out of the block.
