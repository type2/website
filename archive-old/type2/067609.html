  Thats basically all I use. Over here (UK) if you buy the little
  bottles you'll mainly find CO2 only. Some places do the CO2/Argon
  or straight Argon in the little bottles but even if you do find them, 
  they work out alot more expensive. 

  I haven't noticed more splatter with CO2 than with Argon, but
  maybe thats more a comment on my welding :)
