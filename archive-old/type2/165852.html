Subject: [T2] 73 rear  e brake

Ok thanks to a couple of list members and a warm afternoon after work i was able to get the stars to adjust finally and also got the new rear wheel cylinders bleed and have good brake pedal now and can stop butttttttttttttttttttt
   
  now i cant get the e brake fixed..
  i think it might be worn out? maybe needs new cables possibly?
   
  i did the adjust just like in the bentley(under front pan section) but i still can pull the ebrake all the way out like airplane style...
   
  soooo some reason or another the ebrake isnt working?
  i have the bottom cables as far as they will adjust and even but nothing...?
   
  i am gonna try to srive it tomorrow to work though cause it needs to be driven and i can drive without a ebrake but need it fixed before wife drives it again...
   
   
   
  thanks in advance
  chai
