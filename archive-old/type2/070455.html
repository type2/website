Subject: Help with replacing Westy top in 68...

Taking the canvas out of the 68--for the wife to sew new netting into it
and darn a few small rips. So I don't want to tear the canvas up. So I had
better come in here and ask some intelligent people when I get p*ssed off.
Grrr...

I have the bottom out alright, all the tiny screws. But when we get to the top:

(1) It appears I have to take the rear braces loose in order to get the
canvas out intact, or install new canvas. But if I take the rear braces
loose I can't hold the roof up, so I can't remove or install anything at
all.

I'm reckoning the rear corners are the last thing you do, and it's done
with two people, one holding the roof up. Is this correct?

(2) How do other people take all these damnable staples out? Just
screwdrives and pliers and patience, or is there a better way?

Thanks,

- --Ken
