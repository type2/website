Hey list,
I have a 72 bus that has a 914 engine in it.  Well just this weekend I was 
driving to Vermont and I started having trouble.  Well I pull over to find 
out that all the oil has spurted out of the engine through seals I would 
assume and upon trying to start the bus I found that the engine would not 
turn.  My friends and I tried to push start it and as I popped the clutch 
the vehicle came to a stop.  The engine would not crank.  Now I guess the 
engine seized up.   So what I'm asking is the engine shot or can it be 
rebuilt?  I'd appreciate anything anyone can give, for this is my daily 
vehicle.

Thank You,
Jon
