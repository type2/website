&gt;1.  Do I need to shim the cylinders?   Stock rebuild here, nothing

&gt;2.  Do I need to CC the heads?

I would do it, calculate the deck height and determine what shims if any you need. You should read this bulletin because it explains how the factory design was improved by shimming the base and eliminating the head gasket:

&gt;3.  Is 20-50 weight oil ok for break in?   I have read on the break in 
&gt;of the motor and will change the oil very often during the first 500 miles.

Yep. The hows and whys of engine breakin and oil choice seem really subjective. Some folks insist on using SAE30.
