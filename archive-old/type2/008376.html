&gt; Speaking of: I did the Hoover Bulkhead Thang not too long ago and
came up
&gt; with a problem that is really sort of brain-dead, I know I should be
able
&gt; to solve it easily but the answer eludes me:
&gt; 
&gt; The whole point of the excercise is to isolate the metal fuel line
from the
&gt; bulkhead, or in this case from the inside of the hollow threaded lamp
&gt; stuff. So you fill the space with Permatex. Okay...but the fuel line
pushes
&gt; the liquid Permatex out. There's some in there but if I'm going to
all this
&gt; trouble I want ALL the space between the two tubes filled with goop.
&gt; 
&gt; Is there some way to pressurize it into there that is easily
accomplished?

Well, you could use the nozzle that comes with the permatex, use
electrical tape to seal the nozzle to the end of the Hoover tube where
the gas tube enters it, and squeeze away.  Messy, but it'd get the job
done.

However, it really isn't necessary to do this.  The point of the
bulkhead fitting is to increase the bearing area against which the
tube rests.  The wear is then spread out over the entire area rather
than being concentrated in the thickness of the engine tin.  The
amount of wear that will occur inside the fitting is so small that you
really need not worry about it.  If it were mine, I'd leave it dry.

Another approach I've seen for running a tube through sheet metal is
to use an electrical clamp of the style used when running Romex into
an outlet box.  This clamp screws into the hole, then clamps down on
the fuel line.  No vibration this way, though I think that you'd have
to be careful not to crush the line.

I'll stick with my customary wrapping of inner tube rubber.  Seems to
work well for me.
