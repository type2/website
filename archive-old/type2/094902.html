Subject: Re: [T2] won't start still - help!

Billy,

With ignition on remeasure coil voltage. If its 8 volts measure directly 
across the battery terminals (posts not clamps). If its 8 volts also you 
have a battery problem. If the battery is 12 or more you must find out where 
the 4 volt drop is occurring.

Measure the voltage drop from the negative battery terminal to the engine 
ground. It should be zero or very close. Measure the voltage at the starter 
to ground. 8 volts? Check the battery cable to the starter.

By the way I assume the 6 volts at the pump is measured with the starter 
turning. 6 volts at the pump with the starter turning might happen with a 
low battery. What is the battery terminal voltage during start? 8 volts?

Maybe the electronic ignition needs more than 8 volts to play. Try a fully 
charged battery.

Good luck.

Chuck
