Subject: Re: [T2] remanufactured brake parts

I had the same thing happen to me. I think I was able to 
get one pad wedged in, and when i tried to force the 
other one in, my effort was rewarded with a pad that was 
slightly thinner for an inch or so. The guy at the shop 
was cool and gave me a break on the correct pads (he 
admitted that he'd given me the wrong one. Come to think 
of it he also sold me the wrong rear brake shoes, and 
was the guy who said a 009 was just what i needed. I 
don't shop there anymore. 
&gt;The real problem
&gt; lies in that the pads they gave me are too large to
&gt; fit between the interior of the caliper and the rotor.
&gt;  Yes, the pistons are in all the way, but the pad will
&gt; not even engage the piston, as it is stopped by the
&gt; caliper.  I contacted Advance about the problem, and
&gt; they said that one company listed one part number for
&gt; '71-79 for front pads, and that another company listed
&gt; a different part for '71-72 and for '73-79.  The '71
&gt; pads from the other company are on order to check if
&gt; they work any better.  My question to you, list, is 1.
&gt;  has anybody else encountered this, and 2.  What the
&gt; hell did you do?
&gt; 
&gt; thank you,
&gt; 
&gt; Blake
