&gt;I thought that everyone had agreed that the electronic points replacement

I've said it to the contrary in the past but it's indeed adjustable. See the end of this article I'm still writing:

&gt;Seems like Richard actually called the Pertronix folks at one point and 
&gt;they repeated that the dwell numbers were immaterial and 
&gt;unchangeable....so I am really curious about how you changed them!

Someone on the list reported that only a couple of months back.
