&gt; Does that mean the head has to come off? Laura :o(

probably not,  it is a little harder with the engine in but this in not
something that requires pulling the head if you don't mind working on your
back....the key would be finding a stepped stud if at all possible,
otherwise clean the stud hole up (after removing bad stud) put TWO nuts on
the top (where the rocker goes) and use some JBweld in the hole and
immediately screw the new stud into the hole, come back tommorrow after it
sets and reassemble the head.  remove the two nuts you used to drive the
stud in,  hold the bottom one and turn the upper til loose and then
remmove both,  tighten the nut after putting on the rocker arm, but only
to 10ftlbs,  if you don't have one get an inexpensive torque wrench,
0-150lbs would probably be fine

good luck
