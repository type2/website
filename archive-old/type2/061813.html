Subject: Best year for fuel injection?

I'm considering converting the 2.0 l in my '74 from Weber progressive to
fuel injection; and I have a couple of questions for the list.

What are the variations from year to year about?  Are there pros and
cons I should know about?  Are there advantages or disadvantages to be
had by mixing components from different years?

Also, for the return gas line, do I need to use the later two-nipple gas
tank? or can I put a T-joint in the fuel line just below the nipple?  (I
hesitate to weld on a second nipple.)
