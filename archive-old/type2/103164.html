Subject: re:I have the dealer installed a/c parts manuals

Hey All:

coincidently I just pulled a complete dealer installed a/c unit from
a '78 Westy. It appears very complete, I pulled everything intact, hoses
clamps, brackets. The only thing I don't know about is how the belt
(missing)
was hooked up originally to fan pulley? it goes inside in front of the fan??
Anyways I know the owner would like to sell it, I'm sure any reasonable
offer would
be considered, we don't need A/C up in the Pacific Northwest much.
Shipping might be a problem, parts probably weigh hundred pounds??
Photo available of the under dash unit, if interested.
