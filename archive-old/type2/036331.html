Subject: any wheels you can donate?

Listmembers, I am forwarding this request in the hope that one of you might
be able to help.  Chris has a ministry in Texas and is working on a project
based upon a '71 Bus.  Please contact Chris directly, and not me, if you can
help:

Jerry, Thanks for your prompt attention. I am the Children's Pastor at
a church in the Woodlands, Texas and this '71 bus has been cut in half to be
placed in our children's building foyer. We have even had all of the paint
and body work donated! I am trying to locate (2) chrome wheels (any style)
for this bus. They can be warped and even used. Do you have any suggestions
of where I might look? Any help would be appreciated!
