Subject: [T2] high revving 74

Howdy!

	My newly recomissioned 74 is behaving badly. After it warms up, it revs
high. When cool, it idles normally. Only after driving does it rev high,
and maintain its high rpm no matter what, while running. The annoying
thing is, if I shut it off, even for 3 seconds, the idle returns to
normal. I originally thought it was a sticky choke or a sticky throttle,
but It looks fine and works fine while it runs, right up to when it
revs...

	I have stock carbs, stock dizzy, stock everything, and the bus is a
federal bus, not a fornicalia bus...

	Any ideas?

If ye love wealth better than liberty, the tranquility of servitude
better than the animating contest of freedom, go home from
us in peace. We ask not your counsels or arms. Crouch down
and lick the hands which feed you. May your chains set
lightly upon you, and may posterity forget that ye were our
countrymen. -- Samuel Adams, speech at the Philadelphia
State House, August 1, 1776.
