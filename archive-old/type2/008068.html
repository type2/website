&gt; With the recent talk of fire, and since I am in the middle of
replacing my
&gt; fuel lines on my 1970 Westy, I thought it might be a good time to
bring
&gt; this up.  Especially since I have a few questions. :-)

&gt; - My Westy had the original fuel hose with the metal line running
straight
&gt; to the fuel pump.  I obviously need to keep a piece where it goes
through
&gt; the firewall (yes I have a new grommet), but how much metal line
should I
&gt; run before I go back to the braided cloth?  Just enough to run
through the
&gt; firewall (6&quot; or so) or should I keep the original metal piece with
the bend
&gt; in it going until about 3&quot; from the fuel pump?  Any advantage to
either?

Stick to the original length of metal line.  Metal line is much more
durable than the rubber hose.  When I need to fabricate these lines I
use steel brake line which has the same OD and thicker walls than the
original VW metal line.  

One change I did incorporate is to extend the metal line about 3
inches further forward of the front tin.  This gets the rubber hose
further from the heat of the #3 exhaust pipe.  I think that the
original metal line was a Beetle part reused on the bus and that the
bus line would have been longer if VW wanted to spend the $$$ on
redesign and separate parts.
 
&gt; - Finally, what is this bulkhead fitting that The Honorable Mr. Hoover
&gt; talks about?  I have not bought a CD yet, and the sermons are
well...you
&gt; know.  I saw talk of it in the archives.

Go down to the local hardware store and look at the lamp parts. 
You'll find a threaded tube that is commonly used to put lamps and
other light fictures together that has an ID perfect for the fuel
line.  Get a piece of this stuff about 2 inches long, add nuts and
washers to allow it to be secured to the hole in the front tin, and
you're in business!

OTOH, I simply use a 2 inch wide strip of heavy duty inner tube. 
Wrapped around and around the fuel line until it is slightly larger
than the hole in the front tin, then pushed into the hole it holds the
fuel line nicely and lasts far longer than the grommets usually
installed.  I like this approach since there are no nuts to come loose
and the whole thing is easier to install (especially when
retrofitting) than the Hoover bulkhead fitting.  Choose your pizen...
