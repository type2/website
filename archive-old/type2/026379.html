&quot;What is a good operating temperature for a 1600? I'm not for sure, but I
figure I am probably hitting 225 to 230 degrees. 230 is the temperature
where all sorts of bad things are supposed to start happening (per Gene
Berg).
Am I missing anything here? If I don't figure this thing out soon, I'm
dropped it off at the local VW mechanic. I would just really like to figure
this out, and fix it myself. any ideas?&quot;

Thanks,

	Hey there Jeff,
I would check to see if your thermostat/ cooling flaps are operational.
They are installed?  Is this a doghouse shroud?  If not, I'd suggest getting
one. They might not be opening fully(or at all).  You might want to invest
in some Type 3 cooling tin too.  Is the engine cmpt. sealed COMPLETELY?  If
not, hot air is rising into the fan and being blown across your already
sizzling cylinders. 230 isn't bad if it's 115 degrees outside and you're
driving uphill at 70 MPH.  It sounds more than a little warm otherwise. At
those temps, nasty things start happening to your heads, and your oil.
