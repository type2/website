Subject: Re: [T2] Bus won't start in morning, but starts in evening?

Hi Beth,

Is that 78 Bus running with the original fuel injection?

Sounds like the Cold-Start injector or Themal Time Switch may be 
malfunctioning. There's an FI manual online at...

http://www.everybus_dot_com/~greg_potts/Bosch_L-Jetronic_FI_Manual/

...that will help with troubleshooting.

Happy trails,

&gt; For the last  two days my bus has been unable to start in the morning; 
&gt; it will turn over but won't catch at all, despite my fervent prayers. 
&gt; Then, by about 3 or 4 pm, it will start on the first try.  Prior to 
&gt; this, it had been getting harder to start, by which I mean it took 
&gt; longer for it to catch when I turned the key and ran a little rough, 
&gt; almost wanting to stall out at first.  I had attributed this to the 
&gt; very damp weather we have been having, but now it is just plain hot 
&gt; here. Guess it is a good thing I don't go into work till 7 pm, but 
&gt; then when I get off at 7 am I am screwed!  Any ideas?  Thanks, Beth/78
