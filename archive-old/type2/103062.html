Subject: RE: [T2] aftermarket, intermittent wipers

&gt;Not having either a Golf or Vanagon wiring diagram to reference, I can't
&gt;tell if it's OK if this contact closes simultaneously with the non-delay
&gt;slow speed contact, or not.  The wiper switch in my bus has 3 positions,
&gt;OFF, SLOW and FAST.

I just read your message again. You've got to have a separate position on 
the wiper lever for the delay function.

Since the lever is just a switch, you've got to have 3 positions and off. 
That's the reason I said it would require a separate switch on the dash or 
something to function as the delay position that you don't have on the lever.

I'm think this separate switch could function as a power source for the 
delay relay or simply a switch to move the low speed wiper function from 
normal low speed to delayed low speed. Either way. I'd just buy a fancy 
looking toggle switch for the delay. Maybe use the VW early baywindow rear 
dome light switch so it looked stock. Pulls out - is on or off and mounts 
in the dash near the headlight switch.
