Subject: RE: Oxy-Propane Welding?

Ken:
If memory serves, oxy-acetylene burns at about 5,600 degrees. It works for 
body repair, if you use a little, teeny tip. But it takes a lot more skill 
than MIG welding. I spent a lot of time burning holes in sheet metal with 
oxy-fuel, which is why I went to MIG. Perhaps the lower temperature of 
oxy-propane would negate this, I don't know.
 ----------

So I'm looking through an industrial supply catalog and I come across a
little propane-oxygen torch setup. It says this thing burns at 4600
degrees, and it says it can braise, weld or cut. I don't even know what
braising is.

Could this possibly weld body panels? I'm not looking for show-quality
stuff, just rust repair that will hold up. The gas setup is a LOT cheaper
than a real welder.
