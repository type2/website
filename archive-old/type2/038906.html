Subject: Re: Our 72 Bus

hi all,

very nice bus, but i have a question (nitpicky im sure)

I have an interior out of a 73 westy weekender, and i have seen a 72 westy
weekender, among others. and they all had full width rear seat, not a rear
seat with the blind spot cabinet...

So, is this just a different kind of weekender than i have seen
previously, or is it maybe a step in between the weekender and the full on
bus with the poptop?  Like a westy standard model or something?

Just curious,

Steve
