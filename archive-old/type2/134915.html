Subject: Re: [T2] Charging Problem

From: &quot;john kolak&quot; &lt;jkolak_at_gmail_dot_com&gt;
&gt; &gt; It runs inside a jacket that goes inside another slightly larger jacket
that
&gt; &gt; leads through the tin into the alternator.
&gt;
&gt; That's the wire for charging your battery...
&gt; So what is the loose wire?

Darn, my mistake.  I traced the loose wire, not the others.  It appears that
it is indeed the charging wire.

&gt; Well, I'm not sure why you have two wires, but I'm with you in being
&gt; tempted to hook it up. I think you could be right about it being 33
&gt; volts because it's not hooked up...

The wire definetly comes from the alternator.  The harness splits just where
it comes through the tin behind the heater duct.  The harness is like
your's, in that it splits into two.  It certainly looks factory to me.

Anyone else on the list agree with John and me about hooking it up to the
positive terminal on the battery?

&gt; You sent me this in p-mail. If you want I could post this to the list for
second opinions.

I just did.
