Hi List!  I'm relatively new here so let me tell you about myself-
My first VW was a 65 Ghia that was given to me when I was 14.  I now
have a 67 Beetle that my grandfather bought new, a 71 Westy that I
rescued from a local wrecking yard, and a 67 Ghia that was given to me
last week.
When I brought the Westy home and was cleaning it out, I found the
owner's manual, the Camper manual, list of VW dealers in US (circa 1971)
and the window sticker!  My bus cost $4007.50 in 1971.  The westy option
was 1300.00 alone.  It was sold at Leon Ray VW in Miami, FL.
I'm presently fighting an oil pressure problem in my new 1776, but as
soon as that's cleared up I'll be buzzing around again.  Later- 

-Pat
Of all the things I've lost, I miss my mind the most.
