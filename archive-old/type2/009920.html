&gt; Does anyone ever use the irc.type2_dot_com chat server? Seems like that
would be
&gt; so much quicker than e-mail ya know... and it IS there, why not use
it?
&gt; Just an unresearched thought.

It is quick and fun to use, but of course if there's nobody there it
can be kind of boring :)

Look for us around 5 PM Pacific time (8:00 Eastern, midnight in the
UK, lunchtime Down Under)

The conversation tends to stray from buses, but that's OK for a chat
room.

Point your chat software at irc.type2_dot_com
The name of the room is #buslist

See you there!
