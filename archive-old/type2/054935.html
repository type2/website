Subject: Parting out (whats left of) a 78 Westy - Last Call

Hey there Folks,

The subject line says it all. I'm going to have to get rid of my 78
donor soon. Located in Fall River, MA. No engine, no tranny, most of
the interior is gone. It will be one year since it was totaled (not
my fault) in a month. Have to let go sometime.

Whats left: (not much, ask Access Systems Bob)

Upper rear cabinet
Rear closet (no mirror)
Jalouise windows (I won't ship, can't guarantee they won't break
during shipping)
rear table and leg (I bought this sight unseen-has water damage but
can be refinished)
Pop-top and luggage rack (canvas is shot, top needs refinishing, of
course no shipping)
Steering Wheel, turn directional, and wiper control arm
Instrument panel
Green plaid upper bunk cushion - the bigger of the two ($65 with
cushion, $45 without (fabric alone), shipping in US included)
Green Plaid cushion (a little faded), fits over the engine (cheaper
than the one above)
** I will trade both of the above for some brown plaid material.

Other miscellaneous parts and pieces too. Some details are on my
webpage. Click on the swap area button. Items not priced are best
reasonable offer. If you're looking for something specific, pmail me.
I still have to pull some of the things I need (steering box, stuff
for some other people), but the bus is leaving soon.

All proceeds to benefit the &quot;John wants a splitty&quot; Fund.

TIA,
