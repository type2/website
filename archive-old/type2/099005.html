Subject: Door warning buzzer: Don't use it.

Hey all,

I don't use the door buzzer, and never had for that mater.

On my 74, there is 4 wires that connect to the driver side switch, and just a 
ground and spst switch on the passenger's side.

Since I don't use this, and don't plan to use it, can I just take all that 
wiring out to tidy up, or am I making for a pandora's box?

Thanks
