Subject: VW Capacity (1976 Westfalia)

Okay, this will be my third post to the list, and the first two were very
helpful.

I'm in a rock band, consisting of four people. I have a 76 bus that I'll be
putting a new engine in, because the current leaks and burns a decent amount
of oil. The guy who had it before me put a small hitch onto the bumper,
which I'll re-enforce and make sure it's on there tight.

My issue is we go on tour a lot, and for the four of us, this would be
perfect. Three amps fit nicely in the back over the engine, two cabinets fit
well behind the driver, but we're gonna need to tow a little trailer behind
twinkie. The trailer will only have a cabinet and drum kit in it, which
really don't weight that much. 

But now we're talking about four people (two are light, one is huge, one is
medium) and a light load trailer on a 76 bus. We wont be hitting the
mountains too much in the middle of the summer or anything like that, but is
this just too much load for a veedub? If it's not, since I'm putting a
rebuilt engine in, should I get a certain upgraded model, and if so from
where? Will heat be (more) of an issue?

All repsonses welcome... I don't want to be broken down on the side of the
road.

Eric
