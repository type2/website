Subject: [T2] My 69 bus has a bad oil leak!

Fellow Listees:

Can the list help this guy out.  It's been a long time since I've been
inside a 1600 engine.  Has he blown a oil journal plug?  Has he left off
the oil slinger washer on the crank?  What?

Have fun

&gt;
&gt;I have a 1969 bus, 1600cc engine, with a bad oil leak behind
the crankshaft pulley.  As you can imagine the location of
this leak causes a spray of oil everytime I drive my car.  I
have tried several things that have been suggested to me
such as: swapping the crankshaft pulleys (haven't tried a
brand new one though), doing a new ring job, replacing the
oil pump gaskets, and I've even tried stopleak.  Anything
I'm missing?  Help me out before I burn my engine up!
