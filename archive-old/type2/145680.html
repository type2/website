&gt; Also what is going on when the 3rd gear keeps
&gt; slipping?&lt;&lt;

First of all, make sure your clutch cable is adjusted
properly. If it is &quot;slipping&quot; in third gear, then
crawl under the bus and turn the wingnut on the end of
the clutch cable OUT (counterclockwise) a few turns
and see if that helps your slippage...
