Subject: Re: [T2] Re: 55 mph speed limit

&gt; Well.... there is 70 mph and there is 70 mph.  My
&gt; speedo now reads correct with LT27/8.50/14 tires.
&gt;  I've verified it with GPS and also with police
&gt; radar.  The speed was REALLY optimistic with the
&gt; stock size tire.   I suspect others are suffering
&gt; from these symptoms.

im around 10mph optimistic with stock tires. I drive 70 (well on the
speedo) a lot. its a 68 with a 1600 and any faster I think is pushing it.&gt;
