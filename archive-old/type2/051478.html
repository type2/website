Subject: RE: [T2] Trailer Advice

The bolt pattern on a standard trailer is most commonly 5 on 4.5. A bus is 5
on 112mm, the difference is very little, 112mm=4.48in. If you wanted to, you
could use Bus rims on most boat trailer as long as you check them every so
often. I have seen Ford Ranger rims and other Ford/Dodge rims on a Bus and
they had no trouble with them falling off. However I DO NOT SUGGEST YOU TRY
IT. Use the rims designed for the Bus. On a 1000lb trailer I am willing to
take a little more risk than a 5000lb Bus with my family in it.

Gentlepersons-
                      Any chance an old brake drum from a bus could be 
drilled to accept 
bolts mounting it to the trailer and then leaving VW studs for mounting?
Sort 
of like
using the drum in the same way that a wheel adaptor allows other wheels to
be 
mounted on VW hubs? Might require machining off the inside of the drum to 
provide
clearance and lightening, leaving just the stud face.
