Subject: 79 calif ignition in a 74 westy, 76 engine...

Q.1 - can I connect a vdo tach to the cal electronic ignition.
Q.2 - is it ok to power up the ignition module from term 88a on the double 
relay? It seems to work fine,
Q.3 - I don't have the throttle body with the retard port,, so I left the 
dist retard port open,, and connected the advance to the throttle body vac 
port,, and timed it at 7.5 nach .... is that correct?
Q.4 - should I look for a throttle body that has the retard port... anyone 
have one for sale? 


I have a 2 liter engine... Efi installed in my 74 camper..
I also put in a 091 trans with the 4.57 R&amp;P with the 0.82 4th 

Now.. THANKS! to Karl, I have a 79 calif electronic ignition installed. 

I was out last night,, and the points gave that tell tale bump bump sign of 
needing attention so I thought I'd better install the dist that Karl sent me 
over a year ago! 

you can not see the gap in the points.. I know they were opening,, but you 
just can't see the gap!   ... 

Well,, with that said.. I am sure it wasn't running the best.. but I didn't 
know it was bad...  till tonight! 

WOW ,, power like crazy again!  :-) 


Jamie ,,, just about to turn 200,000 kms ,,, Rivers
