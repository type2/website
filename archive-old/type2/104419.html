&lt;&lt; &quot;Modern&quot; cars have their problems too.  There are several problems
reported on the Honda newsgroup concerning various honda models burning
their valves around 70,000 miles.  Seems that Honda specifies a 110,000
mile valve adjustment interval and that's just too long to wait.  The bad
news is that 70K miles is well out of warranty and Honda just says &quot;so
sorry!&quot; when they hand the customer a $2500 bill for the repair.

I think I'll keep my bus.

Wasn't there a recent flap about failure-prone coils on VW's and Audi's
that VW at first refused to declare a recall, forcing owners to 'wait' 'til
the coils failed before replacing them... ?-(
