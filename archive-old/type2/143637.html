Subject: Re: [T2] AIRS rescue---Engine runs fine, but dies when the 
  engine is  under load.

&gt; I'm a bit confused by this. The coil should not see any more load at
&gt; any time, right? There is nothing to give feedback to the coil that
&gt; says &quot;Scotty, I need more spark&quot;. It always does it's job the same
&gt; way. However could a bad coil cause the spark to become very weak when
&gt; hot? If this is the case, would a visual inspection of the spark be
&gt; possible to see a difference?

coil intermittent when hot ive seen more than once.
and both times didnt think of it myself and had to be reminded to check
it.
