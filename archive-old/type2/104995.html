Subject: Re: [T2] Automatic choke question

&gt;Hey I am trying to get to the bottom of the problem I have with
&gt;acceleration and lack of power, and I forgot to mention that the previous
&gt;owner had the automatic choke disarmed because the connection to the right
&gt;carb broke off and he couldn't get it soldered on right.......
&gt;So, I double checked the disarming steps per Muir,   which is to loosen
&gt;the choke screws and turn until the butterfly valve is all the way open
&gt;and then tighten,  and then tape up the wire ends to prevent grounding
&gt;out.
&gt;Now I have no problems starting because it is not so cold here in Portland,
&gt;but someone mentioned wiring to be a possible problem leading poor
&gt;acceleration,  so is it ok to just leave the choke as is,  or could this
&gt;be a  part of the problem?
&gt;Oh yeah its a 73 stock engine dual solexes  etc.....

The choke only provides extra fuel for the engine when it's cold. If it 
starts and runs okay then no damage done at all. On my '72 Italian spec 
Super Beetle I removed the choke plate and retained all the functional 
choke mechanism so I still had the fast idle mechanism. Worked great.

Could your carb be freezing? Do you have the stock air cleaner and heated 
air portion functional?
