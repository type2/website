Subject: Re (hand crank injuries)

has anyone else out there crank started a VW?  I am sure there is a lurking
cranker  or so  around!!  There are only about 20 59 and earlier buses on the
stats, which would have come w/ a 36hp and crank, at least the May 59s and
earlier.  But there are those buses you all drove 10, 20 years ago, when
there were more on the road.  Any stories of a VW kicking back?      

I am just wondering why there are all these warnings about it?   I don't see
as many warnings about all the other dangerous things we do with out cars.
  ( btw, remember not to drop that motor/bus on your toe/ head).  Or are
people programmed to say that whenever they heard about crankstarting a
motor?
