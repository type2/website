Subject: RE: [T2] Re: type of engine is this?

&gt;Huh? 21 cc is about the size of my moped motor...
&gt;This vehicle keeps soundin' more an' more like a &quot;project&quot; 
&gt;that's been thru' a few hands...Could be either a great find
&gt;or a disaster that keeps getting passed on...

But it is 21cc liquid cooled!  How many mopeds are liquid cooled?  

Judging by the feedback, the seller buys things cheap and then sells them on
eBay, there were numerous comments about the seller not knowing what she is
selling.  (I say she as one of her comments were about just delivering a
baby, or maybe she's a stork) I doubt that she has even driven the bus much.
I've emailed to find out the story of the bus, but haven't received a reply.
