Well, the snow is finally leaving us here in West Virginia, hopefully not to 
return this year, and I got my road atlas out this afternoon to see where the 
bus, the wife, the kids and I are going to go as soon as time and weather 
permit.
I think it will be Cass Scenic Railroad, in central/eastern West Virginia. 
Haven't been there for a while.
Has anyone stayed at any of the campgrounds close to there, and can anyone 
reccommend one?
