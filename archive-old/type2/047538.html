Have you checked out the double relay. Bentley will tell you how.

&gt;Volks,
&gt;    I have done all of the suggested ignition checks and vacuum hose checks
&gt;I can think of.  The bus turns over and starts but will not idle.  I have
&gt;extensively read my Bentley and my Muir books as well as the library and I
&gt;am out of ideas so I turn to you.  My bus is fuel injected and I have
&gt;recently done a full tune up.  (not on the FI though)  I now turn to you
for
&gt;the answers.  Thank you much.
&gt;Dave
&gt;P.S. ( the bus got me to Alaska with no problems so I owe it one)
