Subject: Re: VDO 0-70 PSI OP Sender Part Number Wanted

&gt; I purchased an aftermarket VDO oil pressure gauge at a swap meet a few weeks
&gt; ago.  Unlike 99% of the VDO OP gauges out there that range from 0-80 PSI,
&gt; the gauge I have ranges from 0-70 PSI.  The VDO Part # on the gauge is:  350
&gt; 271 / 2 / 4 12V.

I too got a used guage like this not too long ago.  I called VDO 
direct and they confirmed that the range of the two gauges is the same
and so they use the same sender.  FYI  Jim
