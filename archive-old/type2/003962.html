I've been searching for a knob for my timer/switch for my BN4 gas heater.
Turns out a fellow list member in England has one and would like to trade
for some parts he needs.

 If anyone has any of the parts from his list below it will help us both.
Thanks list!

&gt; The white nylon spacer (one only per vehicle), from the dashboard heater
&gt; levers, which I seek, can only be seen, after the heater levers and
&gt; dashboard instrument panel (the one containing your speedometer, fuel
gauge,
&gt; warning lights &amp; clock, etc.) have been removed from the dashboard.
&gt;
&gt; The white nylon spacer, which is on the heater-lever pivot shaft, is
fitted
&gt; to all 1972~79 VW 17/18/2000 Type 2s!!!
&gt;
&gt; My vehicle is a much modified, British specification, 1973 VW 1600 Type 2
&gt; Westfalia Continental.
&gt;
&gt; None of the 1968~79 VW 1600 Type 2s, were fitted with the white nylon
&gt; spacers, to which I refer.
&gt;
&gt; Ideally, I would like to obtain two of the white nylon spacers, if at all
&gt; possible!
&gt;
&gt; Other small items which I seek, are a few of the 4-terminal, driver's cab
&gt; door activated switches ( fitted into the door pillar) and single buzzer,
&gt; which sounds, if the door is opened, when the ignition is on.
