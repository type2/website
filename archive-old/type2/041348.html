Sounds a lot cheaper than buying a hole new cam which goes
for around $130. I remember reading somewhere that
reground cams weren't as good because after its ground they put
on a new surface harding metal coating and its not as good.
What have you hear about that? do they last as long?
Also would I have to compensate for the grind somehow?

Thanks for the help

Theories:
As the cam (and lifter)wears throught the 'surface hardening' they both will
deliver more and more steel fragments into the crankcase.

As well as this, with less lift you may start running hotter and with less
power.

Wilson is right - the square spot means replace it.

European Motorworks in Hawthorne, CA will sell you a good reground hyd lift
cam for about 40 bucks.

I'm breaking one in right now with reground lifters and have seen no metal 
in
my two oil changes so far.
