&gt; Brian, start by looking at your fuel filter. If there's a bunch of crap in it, that could be your problem. Unfortunately for you, there are a bunch of things that can cause the symptoms you describe. Fortunately, the most common problems are not major.
&gt; 
&gt; Do you know if the PO ran it very much? You might have water in your gas.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, here's a list of things to check.
&gt; 
&gt; Fuel pump. Just because she starts, doesn't mean you're getting the right volume of fuel. Search the type2 archives (www.type2_dot_com; click on &quot;archives&quot;) for your symptoms as well as for fuel pump test. You're looking for &quot;fuel pump volume&quot; ...the volume required and the way to test that...by turning over with the line to the carb disconnected and pointed into a container of known volume.
&gt; 
&gt; Vacuum lines. Easy fix, probably should check these first. These are the little lines going to the carb. Don't have 'em? Well, there should be some plugged up tubes on the carb then.
&gt; 
&gt; Brake booster. On the '71 bus, there's a brake booster for the front brakes. There's a long vacuum line coming up from there and connecting to the side of the intake manifold (the riser tubes that the carb sits on top of). Look on the left side as you look in the engine compartment. If this line is off, you should reconnect it. You may also want to look under the driver's seat (under the bus) at the brake booster and see if that's still connected.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; This is a good start. You really need to get a book like Muir's &quot;How to keep your VW Alive&quot;; it'll help you troubleshoot. You'll also want to spend $25 and get the Bentley manual. I've got a couple I'm about to put on the Internet for sale, but they've got color wiring diagrams and will be pricey when all is said and done.
&gt; 
&gt; Ultimately, I'd suspect something to do with the vacuumm and the fuel because, when you first start the bus, you are getting a fuel mix based on the choke position; once it's started, the vacuum kicks in, drawing the fuel into the engine. If the vacuum is wrong because of leaks, etc. she'll stall.
&gt; 
&gt; Air, spark, and fuel...that what makes our engines go. They are 3 different systems that intersect with each other.
&gt; 
&gt; NOW THE DISCLAIMER: ***I AM NOT A MECHANIC. *** I've been known to be wrong. I'm copying this to the list in the hopes that any BS I'm spreading will be corrected by other knowlegeable persons.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks! Joe
Joe: 
Good advice, but one caveat: DISABLE THE SPARK ANYTIME YOU HAVE GAS
LINES OFF OR ANY RAW GAS PRESENT !!You'd be surprised at how hot even a
tablespoon of gas burns especially if it's on your hands! Probably the
best way to disable the spark is disconnect the wire from the condenser
to the coil on non-FI cars. Sometimes on FI cars one needs the
distributor to trigger to make the injectors work, so the follow
Bently's advice and ground the high tension wire from the coil to metal
on the engine. There was a really nice illustration of this phenomenon
on one of those Fox &quot;Emergency 911&quot; shows a while back when some guy was
fixing his red and white bus in a friend's garage and burned the whole
thing down- bus and garage- good TV - it might have saved someone else
from the same fate!
