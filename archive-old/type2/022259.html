This always is such a great idea on paper, and such a disappointment in 
real life, that I thought I would address it before winter comes.

Winter's coming and those of us with winter driven busses are again 
considering the lack of heat in some of our busses.

Last winter I was driving my bus - sans any usable quantity of heat (I was 
too lazy to take the time to fix the bus right, and the bus 
weatherstripping was shot, and thus drafty) - and working for a local FLAPS.

We got a shipment of those little heaters you plug into your cigarette 
lighter, that are designed to clear the fog from your windshield. They 
claim to put out HUNDREDS of BTU's. Pay attention here because a butane 
cigarette lighter probably would be rated in the hundreds too.

I took one of these heaters home with me to heat my bus. RIIIIGHT!

Results? Little bit of nothing. The only way I could warm up was to aim it 
at me from the stool between the seats. That would at least warm the right 
side of my right leg. It really had a hard time clearing the windshield 
even. Too much glass, and too drafty.

15amps of 12 volts really doesn't have the capacity to make/move much heat 
anywhere. If electric heaters were such a good idea, the factory would use 
these little buggers instead of the complicated water systems found in 
modern cars.

The same probably goes for the capacity of an electric driven air 
conditioning unit versus a pulley driven compressor system like the average 
car has.

The alternator is the limiting factor I believe....

Don't lose hope though. My bus needed the system tightened up, some of the 
ductwork replaced, and the drafts eliminated. It really means the 
difference between warmth and lack thereof.

I have a friend on this list with a '78 Riviera with 70K miles on it. 
Naturally the system and the rubber are all pretty tight. Last winter I was 
driving it around town with my wife (the weather was in the low 40's I 
think) and she actually asked me to turn the heat DOWN, it was simply too 
toasty in there. I had a '72 Euro-spec Super Beetle overseas with the same 
affliction, just too much heat if those levers were pulled back and left 
open too long.... &lt;grin&gt;

The stock system will heat very well into the freezing temps. In town as 
well as the highway. (For those of you who have never witnessed this first 
hand. And they say a VW won't heat....)

You have to: ensure the engine's cooling system is 100% complete and tight. 
Ensure all of the ductwork is complete and adjusted. The thermostat for the 
cooling system is complete and in working order. Make sure that all of your 
door seals are tight (most important). Make sure all of the flappers are 
there and working. Every missing or substandard part means much less heat, 
don't cut any corners!

The biggest problem with the average bus is that not that heat is being 
made, but that it isn't being delivered to the front, and that the 
passenger compartment is drafty.

Those fan kits are fine, but just put a band-aid on the real problem - 
leaky passenger compartments, and leaky air systems.

Hang in there everybody! Keep the rubber side down...

Any gas heater lessons? (Never seen one....)
