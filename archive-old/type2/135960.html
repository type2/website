Subject: Re: [T2] Bumper question

Don, if you want to see what the BD chrome bumpers look like, see my bus:
www.fleshers_dot_com/shortbus.html
 
The black strip is not the rubber molding, it is just a black &quot;sticker.&quot;  I'm not sure if it's meant to be on there for very long- it's not very durable.  Mine peeled right off and a little acetone cleaned it up.
The bumpers are lighter and less solid than the originals and the chrome is not the best- probably will flake after a few years.  However, they look good and I'm happy with them for the moment.
hth..  -Chris
And chrome is just so.... BLING!

The BD picture sucks, but it appears to have a rubber molding. Is this correct?
