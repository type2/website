&gt; &gt;&gt; 2.  There is a port on each of the manifolds and the guy I bought them
&gt; &gt;&gt; from says to connect a rubber hose from one to the other.  Anybody know
&gt; &gt;&gt; if this is right and if so, what the heck is it's purpose?  And should
&gt; &gt;&gt; I disconnect it and/or plug it while balancing the carbs?
&gt; &gt;
On my setup I used it for the Brake booster hose.  Ran them 
together and tee'd them to the hose...  no problems there.
