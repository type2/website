I'm changing the boots on the axel shafts and I went to my mechanic friend
who checked them out.  He let me bead blast all the rust and crap off, and
now they look beautiful.  Now I need help to figuring out what is the best
paint for them.  Originally the paint was baked on, but I dont have the
capability to do this.  Your help and/or advice is appreciated.
