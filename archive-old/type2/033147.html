Subject: Re:fuel grades

Okay people, seems that this subject has been covered more times than I can 
count, not only as an active thread, but also tons in the archives. Regular 
87 octane works fine. the 91 octane list on our busses is bases on another 
method of calculation, not what we use here in the USofA. Think about it: Our 
engines (on avarage) have a compression ratio of 7 or max. 8:1 stock. This 
does not require high octane gasoline. If it makes you feel better, go ahead 
and use it, but it ain't gonna make a bit of difference in how your engine 
runs. And &quot;St. Muir &quot; can go **** himself. Wonderfull writer, colourfull 
personality,  piss poor mechanic.
