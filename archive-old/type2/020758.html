Subject: Brake light fuse
References: &lt;00a001c0b0d2$8af1d860$08f80518_at_escnd1.sdca.home_dot_com&gt;

So here's the issue.

Replace brake light fuse, all brake lights work, including the e-brake lite on dash.

Drive for 300 ft Without Applying The Brakes!  and the fuse pops.  You can hear it.

Have any of you folks seen this before?  Is there anyone out there who can help?
I know there's a short somewhere.  Is there something other than brake lights on this
circuit that I don't know about?

I 've even replaced the taillight assembly's as they needed it any ways.

Any suggestions would be appreciated.  I'm at my wits end.
