Subject: Re: [T2] chicago bus owners

There is a place in Arlington Heights, on rt.14 justeast of Wilke Rd. on
the north side of the street--Foriegn car Repair--
I alway see a bunchof VW's there----bugs as well as buses--
However, they ain't cheap--or even resonable.
I went there and got a quote on putting upper control arm bushings, and
ball joints in my 85 Vanagon---they shot me right out the door with a
$900.00 quote--

There is a VW wrench in Glenveiw, that works for the Autobarn up in
Evanston--he does work on the side at home---from what my buddy the
parts mgr. at the autobarn in Mt. Prospect tells me--hes fair---and does
good work.

If you want to know his name and number, let me know and I'll get it
tomorrow--

Later,


Terry
