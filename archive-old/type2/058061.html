&gt;Looking at the pulley with the motor in the bus...
&gt;BTDC is to the RIGHT of TDC
&gt;ATDC is to the LEFT of TDC.
&gt;Maybe this makes sense.

No, sorry, it still doesn't make any sense to me.  (See disclaimer on my
last post as concerns the quantity of Mooseheads consumed tonight, but
still, this is a simple concept when put in the proper light.)

The way I look at it, if you line up the '0' mark on your pulley with
the centerline of your case (ie. straight up) that's TDC (top dead
center).  And everyone knows and agrees that you VW engine rotates
clockwise, right?

Now, rotate your engine counterclockwise.  This is BTDC.  As in,
anything happening during this time is occurring before your engine
reaches TDC.  

Now rotate your engine clockwise from '0 TDC' and that's ATDC.  As in,
anything happening at this time is After you engine has reached TDC -
aka ATDC.

Hopefully THIS will make some sense to anyone who needs the info.
