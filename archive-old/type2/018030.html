Hello all,

        Well, I checked the type 2 library and couldn't find an answer,
so here it goes. I have a 71 1600 that I bought about six months ago,
sight unseen. The bus had been stored in a garage for about 5 years with
all of the fluids still in it without being turned over. supposedly, the
engine had been over-hauled before it went in. At this point, with a
little help from you guys, it is now running. Thank you so much for
reaching out to a newbie on the list, and to busses. There a few probs
left though. My fuel gauge doesn't work. It is hooked up, and when I tap
it, the little needle does jiggle a little bit, but returns to empty. My
other prob is that when I bought it, the air cleaner was left off, and I
can't figure out what tube goes where. Is there anything I might not
notice that I should check?

Thanks,
Nathaniel,
71 microbus (unnamed at this point)
