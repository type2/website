&gt;  The last owner didn't have any useful advice (he didn't seem to know
&gt;  the bus too well).  In the glove box was a not saying &quot;to start bus,
&gt;splinter of wood in relay, and listen for the fuel pump&quot;.  I think the
&gt;relay in question is in on the left (driver's side) of the engine
&gt;bay.  The cover is off  the this relay, and there appears to be two sides
&gt;to it.  The right side had a bit of tooth pick forcing the
&gt;contact.  Having the toothpick there doesn't seem to change anything.

this is the &quot;Double relay&quot; and is critical to the operation of a FI bus.

they are avaliable new from Rocky mountain Motor Works or Bus Depot and
others.

good used ones I'm sure are avaliable from folks on this list

&gt; In addition, one of the wires attached to this relay (a red wire with a blue stripe) has a section which has been bared, and there is a red bit of wire (which appears to have been spliced in) that is bare at the end.  This additional wire is of a shape and length to suggest that it is intended to be touched to the bare portion of the red and blue wire.  When I touch the wires (with the ignition on - oh living dangerously!) i hear a buzzing sound from the right side of the engine compartment (its not a &quot;pucka-pucka-pucka&quot; sound like I assume a fuel pump would be - but nothing blows up or catches fire)

the whirrring is probably the fuel pump, a FI fuel pump sounds
different.  however the FI fuel pump is on the frame of the bus near the
left rear wheel.  the fuel filter is also there and should be changed.

also change the fuel lines !!!!!  a FI bus runs much higher fuel presure,
about 35PSI and a blown fuel line can ruin your whole day

&gt; So how do I go about starting this bus....
&gt; What is this relay ?

replace the double relay!
&gt; 
&gt; What would having the toothpich there do ?
get any food out from the contacts
&gt; 
&gt; What do you think the the hot wire to the red and blue wire is for ?
going to the double relay. fix 

&gt; How do I know if the fuel pump is working?

it sounds like a whirrring when the double relay closes

&gt; Any advice ?

get a double relay, the relay goes to one position to start then changes
to a run position when the engine starts....while the engine will usually
keep running in the start position it will not drive in that position.
