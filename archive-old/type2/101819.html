Oh MAN.............you gotta' be kiddin' me.

&gt;For one I have Nissan seats in my bus which are higher

Then you must get a higher stick shift to compensate.
Gene Berg makes a VERY nice one.  Puts the handle up

worth every damn penny.

Rinky-dink extensions for the stock shifter are also available.
Look around.
