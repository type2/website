Subject: RE: [T2] Re: POR 15--Now PaintFest

I'll drive anywhere to avoid an expensive butcher who considers metal
work 'pottery' with bondo.
My bay needs little, just a decent [paint match and 3 panels sprayed,
but my split wants help.

&gt; If you guys are serious about this, I also have my 2 car garage w/a

&gt; (since the busses will, be well...err...wet :)

well that would be the difference between a one day and a two day drive,
would still come but it would make it more expensive since I would have
to get a room, my bus isn't a westy and it would be full of tools etc...
