Hi

      Living in Finland mabye gives me the authority to give you some good
advice on this. I live some hundred kilometers south of the polar circle
but we still have long periods of temperatures in the -20 to -25 degres
celcius (-4 to -13 Farenheit I think) range every winter.

The VW engine is known for its reliability in cold weather, at least when
it comes to starting in the morning. Helping it by some heating before the
start is good.  Personnaly I use a block heater. It´s a electric heater in
the sump plate. Only 150 watts but does wonders with the oil. Belive it
saves the engine a lot. If your engine doesn´t leak too much oil I
recommend you to use synthetic oil. Normal multi grade oils tend to behave
like well chewed chewing gum in the cold. Not good for your starter or
engine. And change your brake fluid if you haven´t lately. Fresh oil in the
tranny helps in the first kilometers in the mornig. Old tranny oil also
have the chewing gum effect.

The heating system is as you know not the best. When it´s really cold the
heat tends to fade when the bus is driven long distances at the same speed.
If you are going somewhere in the Finnish Lapland you will do nothing else
than driving long distance..... If you dont have any auxilary heating I´d
recommend you to fix that. Check the library files on www.type2_dot_com.

Personally I would´t go camping in the bus when temperature is below zero
celsius. But there´s no bad weather, only bad clothes:-)

Has anyone got any DEEP experience with taking a bus into the FAR northern
polar circle......Lapland, in particular.
I don't expect anyone to have specific info.....but anything relating to
major LOW temperatures would be appreciated.

If freezing in a VW bus makes a man out of me-  What a MAN I am!
