try www.wolfsburgwest_dot_com for purchase of a new
one...i don't know if they'll have what you're looking
for exactly but they do have seat belts for sale for
your year bus

&gt; does anyone have a seat belt for the middle of the
&gt; back seat for a 70
&gt; bus. I am looking for a new one if possible. I have
&gt; a 6month old baby
&gt; girl who I would like to put in the bus as safely as
&gt; possible. I
&gt; currently have a seat belt in the back seat but it
&gt; is so old I can't
&gt; adjust it and it drives me nuts. Any help would be
&gt; appreciated. Or if
&gt; anyone knows where I can order a new one that would
&gt; work too.
