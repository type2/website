Subject: RE: [T2] Samba offensive responses

Wow, he is serious and took care of the user right away. Everett is a great
guy and was on it like cat fur on a wool coat. He gets the cash from my next
sale!

Tonight I had received a really offensive and racist classified email
response from a member of theSamba. Has this happened to any of you? How
serious is Everett about getting rid of these types of users? I did email
him the creep's email. Bizarre. It is always a shock that people still live
in this world with such hateful hearts.

 

I am glad that this VW community, while spirited at times, keeps respect for
others regardless of race, ethnicity or anything else for that matter.

 

Peace out, and I mean it!
