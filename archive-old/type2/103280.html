Subject: Re: [T2] undercoat

Pressure wash your undercarriage then paint with Kool Patch ...this is a
black roofing patch compound that is like thick pudding and smears on with a
brush and can be cleaned up with alcohol before it dries.

I did my 1982 Westie about five years ago and it still looks like new
underneath.

&gt; I'd appreciate opinions on the best way to do this. I've heard that Waxoyl
&gt; is very good but then I've also heard that Agway or Husquarvarna bar oil
&gt; works well.  How about a US source for Waxoyl. The only one I've found on
&gt; the web is the Swiss headquarters and they don't list US distributors.
&gt; Thanks in advance,
