Subject: Buses Of the Corn 2004 trip report.

Elvis has left the building.

60 Buses from all over Ontario and from CT, KY, NC, NE, NJ, OH, VA, and 
WV made this the best attended Buses Of The Corn yet. A good time was 
had by all.

Thanks must go out to GermanSupply_dot_com and Suburban Design Core for 
their sponsorship. Collie and Adam, their staff and spouses put in the 
effort that helped make the event a success. Thanks also to my Family, 
to AJ Welsh, The Auch's, Mike and Heather Schmitz, the Door Prize 
donors, and the folks who travelled from far and wide to attend.

I'm taking the family to the Dixie Bus Gathering for a vacation so 
until I get back I'll leave you with a few pics from my personal 
highlights:

If you have trip reports or pictures to share please send them to me 
and I'll update the website sometime around August 17th. I'm signing 
off of list traffic while I'm off, so if you attended and post a report 
please CC me on the message.

Happy trails indeed!
