Subject: White Bus Abandoned on I-70 in MD

I was driving from Pittsburgh to Baltimore this morning and saw a white
bus abandoned at exit 9 on I-70 (Eastbound) in Maryland.  This is just
by where I-70 and I-68 split.

It was either an early bay or a splitty - I initially thought it was a
bay, but I was going too fast to take full stock of what the front of it
looked like in the rearview mirror, and it had side scoops on it where the
intakes would be for a splitty.

Anybody know anything about it?

Anybody need any help with it?

My guess would be that someone broke down coming home from Sunshine
Daydream in WV (but that's just a guess).

Looked like a pretty straight bus (at 85 miles per hour).  Call if you are
affiliated and/or need help as I'll be passing back through there this
afternoon.
