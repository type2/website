&gt; BTW, the &quot;original&quot; VW concept was the Tatra T97...Unfortunately,
&gt; it took 'til 1967 for Tatra to get a court settlement... ;-(

&gt; Hey Tony  They must have been their own lawyers.     What has been said  the
&gt; man who defends himself has a fool for a client and lawyer :)   Later  Mark

&gt;
   Not really...The Tatra was one of the most innovative car manufacturers
during the
1930's...Unfortunately it was also Czech, so any problems with Porsche
borrowing
from the T 97 - (The T97 was an aerodynamic car with an air cooled flat four
mounted
in the rear with independant front and rear suspension with swing axles;
sound familiar
... ?-) - were solved when the German army overran Czechoslovakia. After the
war,
Tatra ended up behind the Iron Curtain... ;-( Despite this they continued to
make cars,
but most never made it to the West. They pursued their claims against
Porsche, but
the wheels of international justice are slow...
