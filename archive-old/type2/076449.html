&lt;&lt;  need to buy a new rear shift coupler for my '67
 Splitty and I found an image of one just like mine in

 The problem is I can't remove my old one because the
 screw has a square head. There is an image of the
 screw in

 Is there any kind of special tool to do this?

sometimes you can use an 8mm wrench, or jam a 9mm or 10mm 12 point socket on 
there.  after doing that for years, I found out that snap on sells a square 
8mm socket for I think $8.  I have also found some socket that are non snap 
on that work that are a wierd sort of star.
