Travis,

I have had this exact problem on my 1978 2.0L FI Westy, it started in the 
middle of our trip to Nova Scotia and stranded us in deepest darkest Quebec 
with 1000 km to go to get home to Toronto.  It got worse and worse over 
about a week, starting with the cough when going into a new gear and 
culminating in an engine that would only run at idle or full throttle (which 
worked out to over 130 km/h).  On one of our stops to try diagnosis, I 
finally pulled a spark plug wire and grounded it to the fan shroud and saw a 
pitiful little spark.  Eureka! bad coil.  It was Sunday after 6pm and we had 
no choice but to press on -- at full throttle (which worked out to over 130 
km/h, it was satisfying passing the odd sports car and getting the double 
take!)

When I got home I swapped the coil for a known good stock coil and the 
problem disappeared.  This sounds like the problem described.

Test your coil by checking for spark when someone cranks the engine.  If 
this is your problem (and I think it is), buy an original coil from 
Busdepot_dot_com or just get a generic coil for a 70's Chevy and you should be 
fine.

Additionally Dave W. added this tidbit to me in p-mail:
&gt;if you install a jumper to the solenoid ignition terminal, you can
&gt;make your own coil test without a helper, touch the wire
&gt;to the battery+ and the starter spins
