Harmon,

If you think that I can help with a rebuilt transaxle
just send me an email!  I am more than willing to 
give free advice on the list but for business type 
mail that should only be conducted off-line. 

FYI- I realize that he needed to go 548 miles and
did not want to tow it for around $1000 or so but for
those on the list please do not do that unless you're
in a jam like Harmon was.  Most rebuilders, like me,
will overhaul your gearbox and do not offer a over the
counter exchange unit.  The reason for that is we 
have to pay around $175+ for this style of transaxle
core at the wrecking yard and do not want to get a
totally destroyed unit in on trade thereby loosing
that core fee.   In Harmon's case it was still cheaper
to trash the transaxle and pay a core charge than
to shell out the extra big dollars to rent a dolly or
tow.  But for folks that this happens to in their local
area try not to limp home- it maybe more expensive
to do it that way than a simple tow!
