Subject: Administrivia: [T2]

Volks,

At the urging of a couple of list memebers, I am having a go at modifying
the subject line of all the messages that this list propogates.  the
reason is to make it easier for you to sort your incoming mail.  If you
have any comments, problems or such, please send them to the admin
box...type2-admin_at_type2_dot_com and I, or whoever is on duty will respond.

                           H Steven Dolan
