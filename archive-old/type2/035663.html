Subject: wiring diagram for 77 needed

Does anyone have a jpg copy of the wiring diagram
for a 77ish Van?

I'm having a bit of a problem finding one on the web.

My starter solenoid isn't kicking out when I turn the key
to the &quot;off&quot; position.  I can only assume that the solenoid
is defective in some manner.  I'm hoping to find some way
to manually de-energize the circuit and get the starter to
disengage.

I removed the starter assembly and the solenoid plungers 
appears to be free.  A friend of mine offered that internal
corrosion on the solenoid contacts can cause it to stick.

Hopefully the spot I shoveled out to work underneath the van
this afternoon won't drift back over tonight ;)

thanks all


matt
