Subject: Re: [T2] Faster than my speeding Bus

I had a similar incident in the ancient past when I owned a 1956 Dodge
panel van.  Double doors in the back...  The spare tire was free in the
back, leaned up against a video game cabinet I had in there...  don't ask...

I hit the brakes at a stop - the wheel got momentum, hit the rear door,
it popped open and the tire merrily crosed 4 lanes of traffic to pop up
over the curb on the other side of the street and into a business's
&quot;yard&quot;, right next to a cop car.

I pulled over, retrieved the wheel and rolled it back across the street.
 At this point an officer (Sunnyvale, CA - they were real sterling
bastards) demanded of me &quot;just what did I think I was doing?&quot;

I was SO tempted to respond that &quot;Well, y'know, just walking my tire.&quot;
But instead, perceiving that this man had absolutely NO sense of humor,
I explaned the situation.  He stubbornly retained an attitude that I had
some evil intent...  Whatever.

I now restrain any wheels that are in the rolly polly position before
traveling with them.  ;-)
