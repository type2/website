Subject: Re: [T2] Heating possiblities

I may have missed the original post.  But here goes;  The other day at
Advance Auto I saw a 12v ceramic heater that looked like it would be good
for heating up front or at least defrosting the windows.  I plan on at least
trying it if I ev er get my Bus going.

&gt; I think I am waiting for the resurgence of electric cars, or even the
&gt; hybrids, they will need decent heat to sell in the northern parts of the
&gt; world

&gt;  &gt; Hi All,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I was out nosing around the WEB (imagine that:-) and
&gt; &gt; thought to take a look at what kit plane owners might
&gt; &gt; use to heat themselves.  I happened across this link
&gt; &gt; and was wondering if anyone else had had any
&gt; &gt; experience with this sort of thing:

&gt; &gt; Lemme' know
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thinking outside the box,
&gt; &gt; Brian
