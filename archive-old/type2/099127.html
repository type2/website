Subject: very wierd shifting!

So, I was driving down the freeway just cruising along and then I had to
slow down and downshift.  I pushed the shifter into third and it was
spongy going into third.  It went in, but I had to push it a bit...
like, I'd push it, it'd click a little, then I still had to push it a
little more to get it in gear, then it would spring back a little.

Here's the wierd part.  It does this in 1st and 3rd, not in second and
4th.  It also did this once to me before after I drove on the freeway
and then disappeared the next time I drove the car.

unfortunately, now it's back.. anyone have any ideas what this could be?

thanks,
Mike
