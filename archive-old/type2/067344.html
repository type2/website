&gt; I also have one of these welders and have done a LOT of welding on

&gt; the counter asked what I was using it with. So I told him, and he
&gt; said &quot;oh, one of -those-.&quot; I didn't ask him what he meant though.
&gt; I've been very happy with it.

&gt; I find that it is easier to weld with the flux-cored wire, but the
&gt; MIG does a nicer job.
&gt; 
&gt; Oh yes, what do you mean by &quot;adjusting the nut holding the

Did you know that you can use CO2 as a shielding gas? It may splatter a
little more, but for mild steel its a good shielding gas, and is about
the cheapest one you can use.
