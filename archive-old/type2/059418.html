&gt;It is for item number 5 that I have asked the questions mentioned above. It

The bus seats are very flat, i.e. the bottoms are not very thick.  You will
find when you look at aftermarket seats that most of the seat bottoms are
very thick.  I guess that's how they are able to make them so comfortable.
Unfortunately, if you put those seats in a bus, you will be hitting your
head on the ceiling and your view out the windows will be reduced.  If you
spend lots of time looking at scenery from the front seats of your bus like
I do, this will take it's toll on your neck.  If you're 5'6&quot; or under, it
may not be a problem.

I looked at a lot of seats, and ended up putting Porsche 924 seats in my
bus.  They are of nice-looking black vinyl, very supportive, and most of
all, they are low profile and I sit at about the same height as the old
stock seats.  They are reasonably comfortable, but a little on the firm
side and on long trips I find my back starts to hurt a little bit.  Might
not be the seat's fault, used to happen with the stock seats too.

I also swapped seats in my '87 Mustang.  The stock seats were ugly,
unsupportive, and the seatbacks were very weak.  I put in blue seats from a
white '90 Celica GT because they matched the color of the car perfectly,
were supportive (nice side bolsters) and just look much classier than the
Ford seats.  While I was fabricating mounts for them, I noticed that they
were fairly flat once the stock mounts were cut off.  If one would be
willing to give up front/back adjustment, they would probably work well in
the bus.  Plus, the driver's side has an up/down adjustment for the seat
bottom, which lets you position the (non-adjustable) lumbar support at
different spots on your back.  Very nice seats.  If I could find a black
pair, I would ditch the Porsche seats for them in a second.
