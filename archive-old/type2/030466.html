Well, I am sitting here thinking and it suddenly popped into my head that
if you had (a) a Type 1 engine, (b) a degree wheel pulley, and (c) a Muir
test lamp, it should be possible to measure the dwell angle directly.
Note that this exists strictly as a &quot;thought experiment&quot;, but...

If you connected a test lamp to the points and watched for it to come on
and noted where on the degree wheel you were and then rotated the engine
until it went off, subtracted the first degree reading from the second,
you would have a direct read of your dwell angle!  Us poor T4 volk are out
of luck until someone makes a degree fan, tho :-)  Note that because the
crank turns twice for each distributor rotation, the # of degrees should
be 100 not 50.  but that would be a dead flat accurate way of measuring
and setting dwell.
