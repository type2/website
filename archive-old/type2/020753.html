begin quoted message-

&quot;Dear fellow VW enthusiasts,

I own a 1970 &quot;autobahn&quot; green VW Campmobile and live in Boston, MA.  I
got your email addresses from the type2_dot_com website's emergency service
section.  This is my situation:  The car is currently sitting in a
Boston city towing lot.  I had problems with the clutch and left it
parked in Boston and of course it was towed away by the city.  Other
than the bad clutch, the car is running fine.  Right now the bill at the

tow lot is $215 and it is going up by $20 a day.  I have AAA service
that will tow up to 100 miles but nowhere to store the vehicle since I
recently moved to Boston from Wisconsin.

-----------

(1) IF SOMEONE KNOWS OF A MECHANIC THAT CAN DO THE WORK FOR CHEAP PLEASE

LET ME KNOW ASAP.

(2) IF SOMEONE KNOWS OF A PLACE WHERE I CAN TEMPORARILY STORE THE
VEHICLE PLEASE LET ME KNOW ASAP.

(3) If I can't find a cheap mechanic or a place to store the car
temporarily I will be willing to sell the car to anyone who will at
least pay the tow lot fee.

-----------

The motor is good, transmission is fine, and there are new rear brakes.
There are a couple of rust areas and dents that could probably be
repaired. It looks good from a distance.  It has all of the original
camping equipment, including a great poptop and screening.

If any of you are a member of Volkswagen email listserver groups please
post this message!

Please contact me ASAP and we can discuss it more.

Thanks for all of your help,

Sincerely,
Mike Powell
(617) 596-1618&quot;
