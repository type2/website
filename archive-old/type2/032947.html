Subject: Bulgaria Report

While I was in Sofia Bulgaria I saw 100's of Vanagons, but only 4 bay
windows, and one splitty. Of the four bays, 3 were pick ups. None were
Westy's.

Even when I was staying in Melnik, a small village in South-West
Bulgaria, there were at least two vanagons in town (out of less than 100
cars).

Bulgarians get most of their cars from Germany, where once a car is more
than five years old the taxes become so high on them they are cheaper to
sell or even give away (I was told) than continue driving them.
