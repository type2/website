Subject: Re: 70 Westy sink/icebox unit pictures

OK
I will take more pictures, in the daylight. I will try to show all the 
features of this westy, and post them this weeknd. I have totake a trip to 
LA, back thursday.

Wher do I find the westy model number?

I will try to show how the sink cover is held up, &amp; how the table works.
