Hiya Tony,

Just had a similar experience but with a bit of a twist.

I noticed a thread over at the Shoptalk forums advertising 1970 Bus parts for 
cheap.  I called the gentleman and he told me to come on out.  Turns out that 
he builds off roaders and specializes in their suspensions.  He was only 
interested in the tranny and the engine.  Everything else was there and in pretty 
good shape.  $20 for all the stuff I could part out of the Bus.  And I got a 
haul.

The twist?  Despite having gone on a well-used forum I was the only person 
who contacted him.  This was such a good deal, I wondered where everybody was on 
this one.  The Bus itself could have made a good project vehicle.  Straight 
body.  I felt guilty about letting it go, but I have neither the room nor the 
time for another project.  Instead it went to the crusher.  I told him to pull 
the Jalousie window (perfect shape) and a couple of other items.  I hope he 
did.
