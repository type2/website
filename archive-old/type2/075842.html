&gt; Hey Volks!

&gt; Good News! I have found a source for Brazilian made light assemblies at a
&gt; pretty low cost, and was thinking about importing a bunch of them for
&gt; distribution here in the states. Many of these include the bulb holders
&gt; too, and I am sure the price will be better than anything else you could
&gt; find around here. (I am not positive on the price yet, as it partly
&gt; depends on quanitity, and I haven't decided how many I am going to get.)

Nicholas,

As part of your research, I thought I would throw in a sad data point.
This is partly &quot;the law&quot; and partly &quot;they can fail you if they want to&quot;,
but....

I bought a set of aftermarket tail lamp buckets and lenses from a local VW
shop back a bit and installed them.  The next time I went in for safety
inspection (VA, required every year, basically a lamps and brake
inspection), I got failed because of the lenses on these.  As it turns
out, to be legal in the US of A, all light lenses after 1966 must be
registered with the U.S. DOT and have a DOT symbol and approval number
cast into the lens.  Most foreign lenses do not have this stamp.

Now, it took an inspector who I believe set out to fail my raggedy bus to
catch this and your milage may obviously vary, but before you import or
install these, consider the temperment of your local inspection team.

&gt; I thought I would do a little bit of market research, and see what the
&gt; demand here on the list is. There are some really sweet looking ones for
&gt; those who like to customize, and stock are available as well for many
&gt; lenses. If enough people are interested we could certainly save on some
&gt; shipping from Brazil.
&gt;
&gt; Also if any of the list vendors are interested in stocking any of these
&gt; in larger quantites, I would be happy to make a deal for larger
&gt; quantities.
&gt;
&gt; There are photos of the various lenses available here:
