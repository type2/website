Subject: Re: list sticker

Here's an idea:

Take up a collection from the list members to pay for the sticker
printing.  Then make them &quot;free while supplies last&quot;.

If enough cash can't be raised, blow it off before it becomes a 
problem for you.

rapalmer} &gt; Evan, I just sent a request to Joel Re: the sticker...he replied that they
rapalmer} &gt; were produced by Richard Palmer. Maybe if we get an order together he may be
rapalmer} &gt; interested in making some more????????????Hint hint.
rapalmer} &gt;
rapalmer} While I would love to print more stickers, there is a problem- to get any
rapalmer} decent price on them, I have to order at least 500 stickers. That's a LOT of
rapalmer} stickers to sell, considering a lot of folks already have them. If both lists
rapalmer} would agree to have a universal sticker with both addresses, (We're still the
rapalmer} same big, happy family, right??), that would make it easier. Last time I sold
rapalmer} them in packs of 3 and 7. That means that about 150 people would have to order
rapalmer} stickers.
rapalmer} Just to try to sucker...er, entice some of the folks who already have stickers,
rapalmer} perhaps I could make these a different reflective color, so they would still be
rapalmer} eye-catching, yet slightly different.
rapalmer}   Then here's the other problem. the last batch of t-shirts I did, about 30
rapalmer} people e-mailed that they would buy one. However, when the orders came in, I
rapalmer} only sold 15, which didn't even cover my costs. I would hate to get stuck with
rapalmer} a box of stickers that I really can't afford.
rapalmer} Anyway, I am not altogether opposed to the idea, just a bit wary this time...
rapalmer} If enough people promise, swear, etc, that they will actually buy stickers, not
rapalmer} lie to me and get my hopes up, I might think about it. As in, this time, if I
rapalmer} receive e-mail from you, I will keep it, and keep replying to you until I get
rapalmer} your order. (You can't escape!!!)
rapalmer}   So, go ahead, try to convince me...(I will trade stickers for pop-tops, or
rapalmer} crew cabs!)
rapalmer} :)
