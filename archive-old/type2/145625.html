I was right there with you until I read this line. ARe
you saying that, once the rocker arm was touching the
valve stem that you then turned in 1.5 more turns?? 
If so, then this could be your problem.  There should
be a gap of about .004-.006&quot; between the valve stem
and the rocker arm push rod. If you tighten the valves
too much, then they cannot full fully close, which may
cause your symptoms...
Of course I may be mis-interpreting what you wrote...
