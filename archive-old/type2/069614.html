Subject: Re: 67 double cab steering LOOSE!

I just purchased a 67 double cab, the truck is scruffy, but will be a great
work vehicle.  The problem is, the steering is really sloppy, like 1/2 turn
before anything happens.  The relay arm is very loose in its mount.  How is
something like this repaired?

im not sure what you mean by the relay arm.   is it the swing lever?   the
pin should not move up and down .  if so, you need to replace the pin and
bushungs, the kit costs ~$35.

is that your only bad spot.   have a friend wiggle the wheel while you lie
underneath and get dirt in your eyes.    how are the tie rod ends?   drag
link that goes to  the swing lever from the steering gear box?  does the
steering gear box 'thunk'?   jack up the truck and check the king pins by
yanking at 12 and 6 on the wheel.  there shouldn't be play.  push pulling at
3 and 9 reveals tie rod wear.  are you wheel bearing adjusted right- too
loose will show play where it shouldnt be.    read the idiot book and get a
picture of all the players in this mystery.  did the butler do it?
