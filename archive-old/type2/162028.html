Hi Rob,

Meeting up in Key west is fine by me, as long as I have my  
sponsorship covered or the movie rights purchased.

BTW, should anyone on the list have connections to help sell my movie  
rights, I am sure we could negotiate a generous finder's fee.

We got our second snowfall of the year last night, and I am SO ready  
for a road-trip right now.

Only 48 sleeps 'til Everybus....

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts

&gt;&gt; It's a $10K trip, give or take. Given the success of Little Miss  
&gt;&gt; Sunshine,  I think I'll put the movie rights on the block for  
&gt;&gt; $200K, and see you in Alaska!
&gt;
&gt; Alaska? How about Key West, say at the Hogs Breath Saloon? http:// 
&gt; www.hogsbreath_dot_com/hogcam/rawbarcam.htm
&gt; Good a place to start as any, besides it's the only web cam address  
&gt; I have for Key West &lt;g&gt;.
&gt;
&gt; Anyone know about camping on Key West?
