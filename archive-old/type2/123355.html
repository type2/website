Subject: Ignition problem

The problem: Starter turns over but engine won't start until you release
the key. Just as you release it the engine starts.

Other issues: The gen light stays on until about 3000 rpm. At idle the
alternator makes noise. Engine wiring is very brittle and I don't really
trust the connections.

Patient: '70 Bus with stock engine and converted to alternator.

Diagnosis: The mechanic says this is a classic sign of needing a new
ignition switch. Are their other possibilities or should I bite the bullet
and tell him to replace it? I've already given him another known working
alternator but I don't want to spend money on the ignition if I don't need
to. Thanks.
