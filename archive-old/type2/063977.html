Subject: Where to put oil pressure unit?

hey now,

i putzed around the engine today...and was trying to figure out where to mount
the oil pressure sending unit....anyone have some suggestions? is there any
special way it has to be mounted? i was thinking of mounting it on a ring
bracket that is on the firewall, with the hose going down. i don't know what
this bracket used to be but it seems perfect for the sending unit. now for the
really dumb question...where does the end of the hose screw into? duh.
