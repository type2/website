Subject: Fan removal



Wanted to ask some advice. I am trying to get the fan on my 78 Westy. I
removed the three bolts and have given
it a few hard tugs. I though about giving it a few smacks with the
rubber mallet, but don't know how easy it is
to damage the crank seal or fan. I tried the usual oil and break away
spary. No luck yet. I need to get the fan housing off to replace the
seals on the oil cooler. Ideas anyone? Thanks
