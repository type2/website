&gt; Well done !!  I wish I had done that on my 76.  I didn't have my Idiot book yet and due to my 
&gt; inexperience I just replaced it for $150 (ouch!) without knowing otherwise.  Although I am wiser 
&gt; now, I am glad that the darn thing actually starts after driving for more than 5 minutes.  

Mike,

You may want to do this anyway - according to reports, this problem may
well come back after a while even with the new starter.  (BTW, for an
easier unsticking than going under the bus with a screwdriver and making
contact from the ignition terminal to the hot terminal on the solenoid,
my local VW guru recommended running a long wire from the ignition post
of the solenoid into the engine compartment, so you can touch it to the
battery and get the solenoid unstuck that way.

I prefer the relay; I think I'll show him what I did.

&gt; No amount of pounding would get the starter to click.  
&gt; BTW, what's the exact procedure for push starting?
&gt; I've never been able to do it properly.  

Ignition on, trans in 2nd, push in the clutch, somebody pushes the
bus.  At about 4 MPH, dump the clutch, and it should start right up.
If your bus is in good tune, this is a snap.

        TTFN
