Subject: RE: [T2] Steering box question

A few months ago I did all of the stuff you're wanting to do.  The Torsion arms are the way to go.  I got a good used steering box off Ebarf.  $79 from a VW shop.  It is tight and works great.  If you don't have a whole lot of play, yours can probably be adjusted.  Mine did and it started popping really bad.  The new (used) one fixed it.  Make sure you go to Ratwell's page and print out the information on alignment and take it with you wherever you have it aligned.  Also the Bentley.  They probably won't have a clue. The manager told me the guy cursed for an hour before he got it right.  Then I noticed the grease marks on the Bentley and Richard's stuff.   Good luck...KR
