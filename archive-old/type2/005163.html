Subject: [T2] Help(Oil filters)


&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Hello,
&gt;      I recently had my 79 westy (2.0L) in a shop for a bit of work. While
it was
&gt; in I had them fix my leaky oil screen gasket. Well to do that they did an
oil
&gt; change of course. Now the leaking oil screen is fixed but has been
replaced by
&gt; an even worse oil leak. I am talking serious dripping. Soo. Last evening I
&gt; crawled under and wipped the whole thing down and took off the  tin
covering the
&gt; push rod tubes and Heads (hopefully you know what I mean). Then I had my
&gt; girlfriend start it up and give it some gas every now and then while I was
under
&gt; with a flashlight checking things out. Low an behold, oil is streaming
down out
&gt; of the same area where the Oil Filter is attached.  Now I know very little
about
&gt; oil filters but I do know that when I last had her in  the shop that they
&gt; changed the oil filter. They put a MANN W920/17 Filter on. Does anyone
have any
&gt; ideas whether or not this filter is compatible? Is it possible to get a
bad
&gt; filter at times, or has it been seated poorly (like they forgot to put oil
on
&gt; the rubber rim before scewing it in). I also checked to make sure that the
&gt; filter is tight and it is real tight.  I am definately going to take it
out,
&gt; clean the area, and put in a new one in. Any suggestions on a perhaps,
ohhhh, I
&gt; don't know..........A friggin BOSCH!! oil filter perhaps.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for you help in advance
