Following on this theme, in NZ we have a add for a well
known American beverage company... (who isn't Pepsi)

In one of their ads, they fill a split bus with a 
canvas sunroof right to the top of the sunroof, 
(supposedly with a hose, and in 2 seconds of Television 
time!!) and then people dive in using it like a swimming 
pool...

You can even see people swimming around through the side
windows...

Would make a great hit for the kids at a VW get-to-gether...?
