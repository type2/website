&gt;80 Westy 2.0 L (6000 miles on it)
&gt;weber progressive carb, 009 dizzy
&gt;
&gt;alright, all I need to know is what the stock total advance is for my 
&gt;engine
&gt;(i.e. with stock F.I. and dizzy). All the numbers in my manuals are for
&gt;baseline (7.5 BTDC) and I need to know what the total advance was with the
&gt;stock setup... thanks. [man, that was one redundant sounding paragraph, go
&gt;ahead read it again :) ]


Centrifical _at_ 1600                8   - 13
            _at_ 3400               20.5 - 24.5
Vacuum      _at_ 7.9 in. Hg          8.5 - 11
Initial timing _at_ idle                7.5

Total                            36.5º - 43º

You will be lucky to get 25 out of a 009, that's why you need to set initial 
to at least 15 BTDC but you run the risk of pinging and you lose the power 
gain of vacuum advance.
