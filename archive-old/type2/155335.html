No one sell the original style seal.

&gt;Anyone found a generic seal that does the job?
&gt;Im sure that the ones being sold are off a fridge
&gt;or something and should be in a parts catalog
&gt;somewhere for 30 cents a foot :)

You can try mcmaster_dot_com Page 3258 for the generic stuff. You'll find vendors like Bus Depot have optimized the seal for use on the bus.
