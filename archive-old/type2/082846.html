For any transportation, think in terms of dollars per mile travelled.  For
a rough number between similar vehicles, divide the number of miles you
expect to drive the vehicle by the purchase and maintainance cost.  A used
vehicle would be cheaper to buy, but you won't get the same miles out of
it as a new vehicle.  On vehicles that depreciate rapidly this makes the
used car a bargain, but on &quot;hot&quot; vehicles like SUVs, new might actually be
more economical.

That said, no vehicle has given me bang-for-the-buck like my bus, and most
of us don't have the option of buying a new bus, so used will have to do!
