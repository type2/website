Subject: RE: Husbands, Busses and Obsession

Sorry to continue this thread on a non-friday, but I've just gotta get my 2 
cents in: To paraphrase an old Porsche quote &quot;...a bus will get you through 
times of no women, with much less heart ache, than women will get you through 
times of no busses...&quot; Just ask my ex!
