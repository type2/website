Hey everybody,

Thanks so much for all the advice.  Even though some people weren't very
positive about my making it home... I still have some hope and the PO assured
me that it wouldn't be a problem turning over with some fresh gas, a new
battery, and an oil change.  (I'll check a bunch of other things: tires,
brakes, plugs, that sort of thing)  I'm brining a buddy and my lady so I won't
be alone if I get stranded. I also have the name and number of the shop that
used to do work on the van, In case I can't resolve any issues.  If anyone is
in the Rome, NY (upsate in oienda county) area this monday night, you could
witness my exaultation as I drive or tow my new van back to Philly for a lot
of love and care, let me know, i'll buy food and beverages for just a little
knowledge and dirty hands.

I will update when she comes home.  Toodles

dan
