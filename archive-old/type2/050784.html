Subject: [T2] Bought 79 Westy, many many questions :-) - Auto Tranny

I've surfed the library a bit today but it's taking too long., I don't have
computer access at home for the moment, so if you please a few questions.
:-)

79 Westy, with an automatic. What can anyone tell me as to durability of
this tranny? It appears to shift very well, and rips along at 60mph, i'm
quite impressed. Thanks, please contact me off list to keep the traffic
down.
Regards,
Courtney
