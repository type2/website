Subject: Plasma Cutter parts??

Corbett, 
You might try some of the hobbyist publications, maybe Hemmings for cars and 
Live Steam for large RR model builders, where the hobbyists have good use for a 
plasma cutter.  Also there is a company [name won't come to me now] that makes 
a digitized table for pattern cutting.  They have advertised in Live Steam.  
Maybe Fujitsu/Fanuc have some stuff for this application??  My buddy Tom K. 
started a grass fire while he was experimenting with his plasma cutter on a dry 
summer day; fortunately got it out before it reached his farmhouse ;-))  That's 
all I can think of right now.... Glenn

I just picked up a plasma cutter and I need to verify that it works. I need to
replace the nozzle and electrode. Can anyone point me in the direction of a
company that sells these parts by the single unit? It is a snap on YA2225. I
found the parts on the web, but they are in bulk of 25 or more. I just want to
verify it is working before I drop any money into it.... Corbett
