Subject: Propane fridge in a '74 Campmobile?
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

I'd like to retro a propane fridge in my '74 Campmobile.  My cabinet is next
to the sliding door, so I can't vent the fridge out the side.  Has anyone
tried venting their fridge out through the floor?

TIA
