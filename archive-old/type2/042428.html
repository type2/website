Ahhh. If perhaps I had known you were looking for definitive measured 
results from the git-go I would have understood what you were asking.  
Apologies for my tone of the earlier reply, I was _at_work and it was a wierd 
day.  Maybe shouldn't reply when wound up huh?

I too am interested in the metrology of what my engine is doing, I just lack 
the resources to fully instrument with calibrated sensors/readouts etc.  I 
don't have head temp gauges though I have thought about it.

There is a difference between oil temp and case temp.  The sump plate is 
insulated by the 2 paper gaskets but connected by the sump plate studs/nuts. 
  There is a correlation, but loose. Also, the gauge will reflect 
temperature changed more rapidly than the case temp should change.  If case 
temp cools 20 degrees as quickly as I see oil temp drops I'd worry anout the 
clearances due to the different coefficients of expansion of the materials 
in the engine.

I have noticed between my 2 busses that the oil will cool faster than the 
case.  Case as solid mass holds the heat longer and the mass of the case 
exceeds the mass of the oil.  The oil running through the cooler then the 
oil gallery and heads etc cools the case.  The oil temp per gauge was, for 
example 195 wheras the infrared thingy measured the case temp by the 
distributor at 205.  It is indeed possinble the disparity could be the temp 
sending unit, but the case remains warm long after the oil's cooled.  I can 
grab the dipstick long before I can hold my hand against the case.

Thank you, and have a nice day!

I'm sorry if I offended you with my reply.
I have been trying for months if not years to get some good numbers for bus
head and oil temperatures.
Most people either don't understand or don't care.  I thought maybe since 
you
were going through all the work of adding scoops and ducting and oil coolers
that you were interested having a clear understanding of what those
modifications were doing.
For instance did you notice the extremely close correlation between your
&quot;engine temp&quot; and your oil temp?  That's because you measured the same 
thing.
  Sump plate transducers measure the case temperature.
Thank You and Have a Nice Day
