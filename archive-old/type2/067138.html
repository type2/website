&gt;I saw a post a while ago from a guy who went by the name Yug (seriously)

&gt;seem to find them on my 64 deluxe but could REALLY use them if they're there.

Yug was replying to my question about the leaky sunroof on my '82 Vanagon. I
found some holes -- stuck a hanger in and wiggled it around, then I tried
blowing compressed air in. Only result is there seems to be more water
coming in when I step on the brakes (only time water comes in). I could
never figure out where the holes went to, the other end, -- that is, where
they came out ... When my husband goes to Anchorage next week he's going to
VW to check on a new seal for the Vanagon.
