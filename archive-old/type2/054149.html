Subject: Re: valve covers

Was just reading in a 1964 Floyd Clymer Transporter Owner's Manual and it
says to soak the gasket in hot water before installing!!!!  It doesn't say
why!  I would figure that it makes it more pliable and subsequently seal
better!!!!!
Comments!!!!?????

&gt; Jason,
&gt; I am not familiar with the rubber gaskets; are they a VW factory part?
&gt; I believe that the bale wire shape and strength was designed for a stiff
&gt; material like cork,
