Subject: Vehicle Weight and Tires

A while back, someone wanted to know how much various years of Buses
weighed.  I had a chance to weigh mine today.

1972 7 Passenger Bus with CV engine.

Weight on Front:  1300 lbs
Weight on Back :  1780 lbs

This was done without me inside, full tank of gas, no cargo other than my
tool box.

Now, not to start more tire wars, I purchased mine before all the info that
has been mentioned and way before Bus Depot had that great deal.

Cheng Shin
205/70 R14 95T
DOT 2UT9
Max Load 1521 lbs

These are much stiffer than the &quot;car type&quot; tires I had on before.  The
stability is much better.  I have taken an expressway tight entrance ramp at
a much faster rate than I should.  I only had 1/4 inch of mark show on the
sidewall.  My only real complaint is the tread noise.  If I had the extra
cash, I would probably replace them, but I will have to make do for now.
One plus for them, they are the first tire I have ever owned that has held
its initial balance for over 500 miles new (I now have over 5K on them).  I
am going to have them checked this weekend, but I am not observing any
vibration from them yet and the wear pattern seems perfect.
