&gt; Hi Bob,
&gt; 
&gt; I'll be starting from Northern Virginia, not far from
&gt; Dulles airport.

well I would wander over the White's ferry and up the &quot;old
Martinsburg&quot; road to Harpers Ferry and back over 340 to Wincester and then
50 West..   There are some stiff grades on 50 but my 78 does it regularly
but it is winter when I go skiing up there

wish I were going with you
Bob

&gt; &gt; &gt; I'll be heading West to WV next month and thought
&gt; &gt; I'd
&gt; &gt; &gt; try to combine pleasure with a little business. 
&gt; &gt; My
&gt; &gt; &gt; two destinations are Clarksburg and Parkersburg. 
&gt; &gt; Any
&gt; &gt; &gt; great campgrounds and sights I should see along
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; way?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; where are you starting out from??
