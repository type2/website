Your 71 has a bit of lower body rust, and you wanted to know whether to part 
it out or keep it?

Well, I say keep it. Why not? The only thing that would prevent you would be 
if your state has 'safety' inspections
or just 'emissions' inspections. Here in New York City, vehicles are only 
inspected for emissions, they never check
the lights, rust, mirrors, etc. That's all on you, but I prefer it that way. 
This way, you can keep your ride, keep workin
it, and perhaps save it. See what you can get away with - maybe there's 
another mechanic down the street who is hungrier than the first guy and will 
fix your starter problem and give you a new sticker for a few dollars.
