Steve,

Yes surveys do generate a lot of responses, but this one was particularly
interesting and kind of adds something a bit more personal to all these
cyber friends we have made on the on the list.  I really enjoyed reading
about what some of the people on the list do and connect that with their
posts. I hate to defy the webmaster but I will hesitantly ad, I am a gas
passer (anesthesiologist)! My '69 Beetle is the only aircooled VW in the
parking lot, I think!
