Subject: Re: [T2] type 4 case oil pressure relief

Hi Dave, thanks again for the great info.
I actually have a VDO sender for pressure only, and a separate (new) VDO 
pressure switch (looks identical to stock) that switches ~5-6psi. I was not 
aware original ones switched _at_ 3-4psi.

As for RPM, yes it is lower than the book, I have always set my motors to 
stock when tuning and drop RPM's back to ~700 afterwards, having a manual 
trans I've never seen the need for the extra RPM.

As I've run the motor for ~30k miles (before I strengthened the relief 
spring, and had much lower pressure) I guess you could say I was not overly 
worried about it, I just figured it was time to investigate further as the 
motor needs to come out soon as mentioned.

Thanks for the details on the tool, I have access to one at work, and that 
was the reason I started looking into the relief first. Unfortunately when I 
look at the seat in the case, the holes are not concentric, so reaming will 
not make the piston attain a full seal (it would have been like this from 
new).
That's when I decided to put a little extra pressure on the spring instead.

Cheers,
Richard

 The one thing that I forgot to ask was what kind of sender you are using.
 Since you know what the oil pressure is, I assume that you may have the
 VDO double ended sensor rather than the vdo sender and a &quot;regular&quot;
 oil pressure switch.
