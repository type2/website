&gt;Question - NTB mounted the tires with 35 psi, the side wall states a
&gt;load rating of 1850 pounds at 65 psi cold.  What pressure should I be
&gt;running at?
====================================&gt;
I am running 36 PSI in the rear tires and 32 PSI in the front tires on 
my 1970 Westfalias with the Yokohama Y356 185R14 Load Range D tires.

Casper has around 25,000 miles on his set.
NewBus has just a few thousand miles on his set.

Casper is generally fully loaded for camping and open road travel.
NewBus is pretty much empty loaded and used for daily town driving.

The above pressures seem to give the right ride, proper pillowing, and 
the treads appears to be evenly worn across the tire faces.

Also, with the above pressures, and using vacuum advance distributors, 
I am getting 24 mpg from NewBus and 23 mpg from Casper as a function of 
overall performance using slow accelerations, and 55-60 mph top end 
speeds.
