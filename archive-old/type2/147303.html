Subject: [T2] FS: 78 Bay Tail light assembly 
 
The entire assemblies for a 78 Bay in fair condition for $25 
Including shipping. 
 
They are soft in spots (like dry rot?) but are still very functional, 
And include the housing and lens for pass and driver sides. 
 
I'll ship to anywhere in the US.
