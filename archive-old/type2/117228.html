Well first of all, congratulations of your new bus!

Ok for the distributor, I suggest you make sure it's keeping it's time.
Set the time, go for a drive and check it again.  It sounds like this was
your problem after the first trip.  Also, if for some reason it doesn't
keep time... don't worry!  These stuff can be fixed easily.

As for the exhaust, I would make sure that is your problem.  Even a small
exhaust leak shouldn't come back into the cabin.  Check around and see
where it's coming from.  Sometime oil leaks can create lots of smoke and
blow stuff back into the bus.  I had a bad problem for a bit with the rear
main seal leaking, and it would smoke like nuts when the engine got hot.

BTW, dual chrome tips?  It sounds like this may be an exhaust off a 1600
motor (ie: ealier model buses, up to 1971).  Are you sure you've got a 1700
in there and not a 1600?  If not somebody's probably been playing aorund a
lot, as you said.  I suggest finding a similar vehicle to do some
comparisons, get to know what you've have and don't have.

Anyways, best of luck with the new van.  The people around here and kind
and filled with VW knowledge, so if you get stuck come get help!

Regards,
Shawn.
