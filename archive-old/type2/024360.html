Subject: The bottom line on exhaust pipes
Message-ID: &lt;7t3i4q$gr80_at_eGroups_dot_com&gt;

Chris, Christopher, and listees,
VW has evidently discontinued the U-shaped exhaust pipes, and when they
were in the stock they cost over $200_at_! So in absence of any problems
with mine, except for the outside sheath being corroded away, I'll just
leave well enough alone. The HC reduction must be fairly small as I've
been able to pass CA smog all along. And if wrapping the pipe would
stimulate its demise, that should be avoided quite clearly. The idea of
fabricating an over-pipe and spot welding it on is one to try if the HC
isn't within limits of the local smog authorities.
In the meantime, when in the bone yard, buy ahead!
