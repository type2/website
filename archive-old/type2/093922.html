Subject: re:[T2] Pop-top refinishing

i did my pop top 4 years ago and it is still in very good shape and washes 
easy enough..  i sanded my whole pop top with a palm sander .. 200 grit i 
think it was... sanding cleans and preps the surface for the paint.. as for 
paint all i used was white wheel paint from my local auto parts store, i 
figures if it was durable enough for wheels ill give it a shot on my pop top, 
and so far so good.. hope this helps, and saves you a few bucks from having 
to buy marine paint!  .. peace .. scott 71 vesty
