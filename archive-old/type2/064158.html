Subject: Alloys

Hi all,
In my never-ending search for a set of wheels for my loaf, I ran across the
web site for the German Car Company, located in Essex England. Its at
www.germancarcompany.co_dot_uk. They have the usual parts venders-WCM,TMI,etc,
and some cool steering wheels. The thing that caught my eye were the alloy
wheel for the ,71-up type ll. They are 6x14, 5 stud, and the price includes
the caps,studs, bolts, and nuts. Anyway, the price is in pounds at 89.99.
After deducting their tax as per catalog instuction it came down to 76.60
pounds, or apox. $116.43 Us/per wheel plusS&amp;H. That is allot cheaper than
what I have been quoted for a set.
 Anyone have any thought on these? Any info on this company or the
fit,quality, and safety, please email me direct. I don't want to start any
flaming or slander on this company.

Thanks...
