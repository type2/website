Michel:
Desert driving is excellent fun  in a bus, you just need to be smart about
it. Make sure your engine and cooling system are in good working order. It
also helps to get the driving done early in the a.m. when it's a little
cooler and to drive for short periods (like 2 hours) at a time. This way you
keep the car happy and give yourself plenty of daylight to explore. Kayenta,
AZ is cool (some one mentioned it in an earlier post) it is near Monument
Valley and the four corners area. It is convenient to a few national parks
like Zion and Grand Canyon. Beware though, it is a dry reservation (read no
alcohol) so byob and keep it to yourself out of respect for the Navajo. The
Hotel bill when I stayed was around $90 per night. Why didn't I camp in my
bus you ask? Because I was rebuilding the engine in the parking lot of a
little diner called the Blue Coffee Pot (the owner actually sympathized with
my plight and gave me a couple of bootlegged beers) so the camper was my
garage.
Enjoy!
