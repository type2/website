Subject: '82 Vanagon AdventureWagen FS - Update

Dear Volks,

First my apologies to those who wrote to point out I didn't put the vehicle 
description in the subject line.  That was a sloppy oversight on my part.

After I posted my FS yesterday, my mechanic called this morning.  He has 
checked out the engine and the box of FI parts I bought.  He says it will 
cost from $400 to $600 parts and labor for him to get the EXISTING engine 
running.  I probably won't need to install the used engine I bought.  

So, to briefly repeat, I was asking $1,250 for the Vanagon, the FI parts and 
the extra used 2L engine.  If someone is interested in doing the work 
themselves, please pmail me in the next day or so before I turn on the 
mechanic.  I have plenty of photos I can email if anyone's interested.

I am 50 miles east of Dallas.  I will tow it to a freight terminal in Dallas 
for shipping or you can pick it up here.
