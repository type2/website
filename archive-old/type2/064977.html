Subject: balancing

I called my local machine shop to inquire about the price of grinding and 
perhaps balancing my crank. I've read Bob Hoover's sermons on balancing and 
know enough to say I want the entire reciprocating deal balanced as a 
unit--crank, pulley, flywheel, pressure plate, etc.

So the guy (a jerk, by the way..is this endemic to people who work in 
machine shops? he asked, donning flameproof suit) says I'm now looking at 
having an ASSEMBLY balanced, and that the price goes up accordingly. Not 
only must I balance the aforementioned parts, but I've got to bring him the 
connecting rods, bearings, pistons, rings, etc. ad nauseum. Why must I bring 
these parts, I ask, if they are not going to be actually ATTACHED to the 
crank at the time of balancing? Why can't I get the rods balanced as a set, 
the pistons balanced as a set, the crank as a unit, etc. He tells me, and I 
quote, &quot;We have to know the weight of the rods, bearings, pistons, rings&quot; 
blah, blah, blah.

This makes no sense to me. So I've brought the matter to the All Wise and 
Knowing List. This ain't gonna be no racin' engine, I just want it to run 
long and smooooooth. I don't want some fast-talkin' machine dude building me 
a formula vee engine or something of the sort.
