Subject: Westy/Vanagon  Cover
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hello All,

I'd like to get a good, inexpensive cover for my
Westy.  Too bad Walmart doesn't have them, because
their car covers are inexpensive and last a long time.
 Any one using a Westy or Vanagon cover that seems
like a good value?

Rob
