Subject: Re: [T2] What torque setting for CV Joints?? 33 or 25 ft lbs

Karl said:

&quot;But the wrinkle is 77's are normally Allen [hex] and
the triple-square cam later. Most 79's were
triple-square and, unless someone put Allens in, all
Vanagons are also.

Perhaps VW upped the torqued value on the
triple-square bolts?&quot;

Great answer Karl.

However . . .

the card in question is for a '77 (allen bolt head??), and it is printed in 
1976, (lower right corner - 1st edition 9/76) yet it says 33 ft lbs

But I will go with the reasoning that allen = 25 ft lb; triple square = 33 
ft lbs, based on the different hardness of the different bolts.
