You have to admit, of all the middle-of=nowhere places to be broke down,
the Vermillion Cliffs sure is scenic.

&gt; Finally our knight in shining tow truck arrived and hauled us in to
Fredonia, AZ, about six miles south of the Utah line, 50 miles from where
we crapped out. I was glad the truck was one of the modern, tilt-bed
variety, as I didnt relish the thought of Tullio swaying back and forth
on a harness type rig. We were put up at the Crazy Jug Motel, what a
great name!

Ah, Fredonia, stayed there several times!  Not exactly a jumpin' berg, but
folks sure are nice.

Glad your trip was mostly trouble-free.  Now that you are home, put the
proper pump on your bus and put the electric one in your spares box
against the next time a similar problem befalls you or another bus person.
