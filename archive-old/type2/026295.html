Subject: Still no start

Someone said:

&gt; Well, I still don't have a running bus. Symptoms: tries to start then
&gt; immediately dies--that is, she'll fire up, but only run for a second or
&gt; two. Have to wait about 5 minutes between starts.
&gt; 
&gt; Something interesting I discovered, when I checked the brain plug
&gt; today...I forgot to plug it back in and the thing fired up the same as
&gt; always...so I'm seeing no difference with the brain plugged in or removed.

	Your entire fuel injections system is ont working. The engine is
starting on the cold start valve only, and the delay
	between starts is the thermo time switch effects.

	It is likely that you don't have power going to your injectors. On
my van the injector power comes from the coil, 
	and is the same connection that powers the backlights. Check for 12v
at the injection ballast resistors, or at
	on of the two wires in one of the injictor plugs (the part on teh
wiring harness)
	Another test is to put a test lamp between +12v from the battery,
and one of the two wires in the injector plugs
	- whihc one you will have to experiment, but it is the one going to
the ECU. When you crank the engine, this lamp should flash showing that the
ECU is periodically grounding this wire. If so most of your fuel injection
system is 
	OK, but the power to the injectors is missing.
	If you have power at the injector plugs, and you cna't get the test
lamp test to flash using either of hte injector plug wires, then there is
something wrong with the ECU, its connections, or something else in teh
system.

	How the system works is +12v goes through teh ballast resistors to
one side of the injectors. The ECU grounds the
	other side of the injector, current flows from +12v through balast
resistors, thorough injector  through the ECU 
	to ground  opening the injector.
