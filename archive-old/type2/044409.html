Subject: [T2] A/C compressor
Content-Disposition: Inline

I thought I had an A/C compressor located for my 83 Vanagon Westy air
cooled but the deal fell apart. I just cant afford a new one from the
Bus Depot at $160 and have sucessfully used junk yard compressors before
but cant find one locally. So, if anyone out there has the small York
type compressor that was working before it ran out of Freon and it has
not been disconnected from the system, it is probably good. Junk yards
here get $25-30 but I will pay $50 plus shipping for a usable one. 
Thanks, Impoverished and roasting in FL, Jack
