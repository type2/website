Robert K &amp; The List at Large:

	Yes, indeedy, it was a good show...

&lt;begin broad humor now&gt;

	You and many others similarly situated received a visit from the
elusive and highly secretive &quot;Save the Bays&quot; Faerie.  Word on the street is
that The STBs Faerie (a distant relative of the &quot;Missing Parts Replacement&quot;
Faerie, periodically observed at East Coast Bus gatherings, we hear) had
flown in after personally dropping off stickers in Canada, Australia,
Mexico, The Netherlands, and a number of other undisclosed Northeastern U.S.
locations.

	Boy, were his/her arms (wings?) tired...

but The STBs Faerie has promised that very, very soon, &quot;Save the Bays&quot;
stickers will be adorning Bay
Window buses planet-wide.  All good little Bay Window pilot's rides will be
sporting
one for the holidays this year, if The STBs Faerie has his/her way.  At
least, that's what our sources are telling us...  YMMV, etc. ad nauseum.

	That is all...
