Bob,

Faster Interior heating is an additional benefit to the thermostat's first
purpose.  You are mostly considering results than can be immediately
experienced and not the engineer's overall intent. Prove it to yourself by
reading an automotive engine design textbook.

The thermostat serves the same purpose in *any* automotive engine: faster
warm-up for longer life, smoother operation and better economy.  Reduced
emissions and people heat are important secondary benefits. The Ford study I
referred to concerned engine wear and the benefits of *proper temperature
and filtering*, and is the reason Ford switched to better tech on both
issues.

To Michael,

The thermostat helps the case, cylinders and heads all reach operating
temperature and stabilize more quickly.  The less the three &quot;fight&quot; each
other the better efficiency over the life of engine. Valves don't require as
much adjustment, compression and oil leaks are minimized, acid/sludge
formation on the cylinder walls due to incomplete combustion is reduced,
just to name a few.

To folks who rip 'em out,

VW introduced a thermostat and manifold heat in 1950.  You'd think after
half a century they'd quit using them if they were not necessary.

the real usfullness of the flaps is to help the anemic heating system in
cold weather, without the flaps there would never be any heat, such that
it is.   Which BTW is a major reason for em in water cooled cars, also
they help with the exhaust emissions.
