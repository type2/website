&gt;
&gt; I am bringing this to the lists attention is if I remember correctly,
&gt; some time ago someone else was being sued or something to that affect.
&gt; If anyone can help us out, we would totally appreciate it. After all,
&gt; isnt all that stuff we sell at the swaps unauthorized? Thanks for your
&gt; time...Brian

Here's the link for the VWoA Trademark Dispute page:
http://www.geocities_dot_com/billberckman/domain.html

You might also go to the Michigan Vintage VW site(http://www.mvvc_dot_net/) and sign their
protest letter that will be delivered to VWoA during their yearly show that is held at
the headquarters.

The most absurd chapter in this saga that I've heard yet is this one:

*As of immediately, I will no longer be selling the VOLKSWAGEN Rabbit
Pickup Tailgate lettering at http://www.prod_dot_net/decals.  We are now and
forever out of stock.  I have corrected the website to only carry
miscellaneous &quot;three inch decal lettering&quot; made of the same high quality
3M media. I do offer a discount if letters are purchased 10 at a time.
We currently offer A,E,G,K,L,N,O,S,V, and W. The use of these letters on
the ever elusive ELKS V WAGON's may be of interest to some. I apologize
we do not have all 26 letters currently available. We are working on it.

I also want to take a moment to apologize to the fine folks at VWoA for
bringing trademark infringement issues of selling VOLKSWAGEN Rabbit
tailgate lettering to my attention.*
