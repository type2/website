Subject: [T2] Propane heater

Please take great care with the selection and use of a heater for your van.
The amount of CO in the air inside your van will not matter if all the
oxygen has been used up by the heater,
you will be too dead to respond to the CO detector alarm.
Tests that we have done to investigate two deaths due to a portable propane
heater show that most of the oxygen is used up before large amounts of CO
are generated.
If you want to use one anyway, insure that the instruction about good
ventilation is followed.

You may also check out the &quot;Darwin Awards,&quot; lots of stories about how people
used heaters one final time.

Good luck.
