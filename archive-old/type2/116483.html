Subject: RE: [VB] Tail lights?

   I have these in a couple of my buses for a couple years now, passed the
test and have been selling them at an even lower price of 25 dollars a PAIR,
used to be 50, then 35 and now 25 and has been that for a few months now. I
have sold at least 200 pair with out a complaint or return.
