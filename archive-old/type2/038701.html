My opinion is that unless your tin is bent in some funky way, it will not 
leak a significant amount of air even with no sealant.  Sealing the tin 
also makes it a PITA to take apart later.

But, I've seen it done before - my bus came that way in fact.  If you must 
use sealant, check out Permatex Ultra Black.  It is thick, smelly, and very 
strong.  Should work great.
