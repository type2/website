Hmmm .let's try to remember, I think I had the same kind of problem on

related to it, such as; Filter, fuel pump, fuel pressure regulator... and if
you have to your FI but if you have to....

&gt; Im having problems starting. Its turning over, just not catching. When/If
I
&gt; can get it started, it tries to die very soon after. If I manage to get it
&gt; going and drive for a while, it runs ok and doesnt try to stall.

check vacuum lines
