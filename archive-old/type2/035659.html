Subject: Frozen lug nutz

I cast the blackest of curses upon the entire family
of the last person to tighten up the lug nuts on the
'80 Vanagon. 

On each wheel there is one nut that steadfastly refuses
to budge. I was pulling the front wheels off to 
try to locate a gas leak from the top of the tank
but could not remove either front wheel because
one nut on each refuses to back out.

How much torque can I put on those? I really
dont want to snap one off. I have already 
bent a lug wrench and shattered an impact socket.
Will an impact wrench bust it free if 3-400 ft lbs
of torque wont get it out?

I hope I dont get a flat....
