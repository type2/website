Finally made it out of Salem,VA. Turns out that the temp sensor had little
to no effect on my problem. I had no power at highway speeds. Stopped in At
Salem Imports and got some assistance from Mark and Co. I have several probs
and at my wits end. While in Salem we found a bad connection to the double
relay and a few vacuum leaks and noticed that the engine is running very
lean. thought we had it fixed and was very wrong. Made it to Staunton at a
very slow 30-35 mph. Got a fuel pump from a flaps and put it on. Back to
65-70 mph and again thought I had it fixed. I am now in pinegrove,pa and it
appears that I am still running lean but the twist is that I am getting
about 13 mpg and to add to that now I am having dizzy probs. Getting cozy in
the comfort inn and will check tomorrow.

Any suggestions as to why I am running so lean but getting such crappie gas
mileage????

Any help or suggestions would be very appreciated

Thanks
Chris
