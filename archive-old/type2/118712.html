Subject: Re: [T2] Broken braking?

I once had the same kind of problem in my Super Beetle: there were times
that the brakes held normally, times when they seemed to be especially firm,
and times when I had to pump the brakes to get them to grab at all! In
addition, sometimes the front end felt like I had rolled over a bit of
gravel --- when there was no gravel!
It didn't take long for me to pull the wheels and the drums off of the front
for an inspection. It turns out that the shoes of new brakes that I'd just
installed had the brake padding break off. The remnants were rolling around
in the brake drum!!
