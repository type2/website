Subject: Re: diesel

This is an old shadetree mechanic's way (described in Muir) to
decarbonize an engine (remove carbon deposits from the piston and head.
 You don't put diesel in the tank, however!  You get the engine good
and warm, then pour the diesel into the carb while keeping the engine
running with the throttle.  The diesel doesn't vaporize, but remains as
drops that get hammered around in the cylinder and provide a cleaning
action.

As far as I'm concerned, water works as well and doesn't coat
everything with an oily mess!  In most cases, this procedure is a
last-ditch method anyway.

&gt; that, but
