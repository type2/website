Subject: How to move the stove outside ...

... and still get that camper feel to the arrangement. (Warning: this 
proposal is not for stock fetishists. And Erik Melzer will hate it.)

One of the things that split window buses had going for them was the 
space provided by the hinged doors, where we have a slider. But it's 
possible to reclaim that functionality. It requires placing a pair of 
fastening points (like the ones that clip the front table in later 
Westys to the dashboard) on the outside of the slider, with a heavy and 
secure backing plate inside. That, and some additional tinkering for a 
lower bracket, makes it possible to hang a shelf from the outside of 
the open door, suitable for holding a Coleman two- or even three-burner 
stove.

A moveable box, maybe a box made up to put between the seats, could be 
pushed into the open doorway, right next to the stove. Install a 
drop-down door in the side and some shelves and you've got a spicerack 
at a reasonably good working height.

If you engineer it right, and if your slider and latch are in optimal 
working condition, you could leave this arrangement set up even when 
you close the slider, which would put you one up on the hinge-doored 
Westys. And at the full width of the slider, this is a lot of 
workspace. The shelf itself would be fairly innocuous to stow away when 
breaking camp.

To get to perfection, rig up a fluorescent light to clip over the top 
of the door flange.
