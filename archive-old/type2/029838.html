&gt; I'm torn - between 2 trailers.  Size (40&quot;x48&quot;) and price ($225) the
&gt; same, as Harbor charges no freight.  The dilemna is weight, tire size,
&gt; and color...
&gt; 
&gt; So, harbor has a trailer with 12&quot; wheels (red) weight 215 lbs.

Bigger wheels are definitely better.  The 8 inch wheels have tire life
measured in hundreds, not thousands of miles.  They also tend to go boom.
Back when I was using trailers regularly I finally switched to hubs that
allowed me to mount standard automotive wheels and tires.  It would be
nice to have hubs that matched your bus wheels so that the spare would
work on both vehicle and trailer, but that is blue-skying it!

&gt; And a place called Armorrex has a black trailer with 8&quot; wheels that
&gt; weighs only 70 lbs.

70 pounds seems to be a bit tiny!  I don't know how much I'd trust
something that light with carrying a significant weight
