&gt;Also for any one taking of the plate in the engine compartment to get to the
&gt;gas tank on a 79 there are two sheet metal screws on the bottom that will
&gt;prevent you (it did me --- with lots of explitives) from taking it off.
&gt;
&gt;If children are not learning then we should change how we are teaching them.

And that boys and girls about the two lower gas tank screws
is something every bus owner that cares to see their gas tank
learns the very first time they want to see it.  And with copious
cursing.  Although Bentley fails to mention those, seems to
me Haynes or one of the others does mention them in passing.
And of course it's all in the type2 archives, time and time again.
That is '71-'79 at least and I think '68-'70 as well BTW though
I won't swear on it.  Seems like the last '70 tank I pulled to put
in the pickup out of a passenger bus had the lower screws.
