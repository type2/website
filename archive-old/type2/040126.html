Subject: RE: Pacesetter muffler

&gt; about 2 weeks ago I put a pacesetter muffler on my 78 2l (got it from Ron
&gt; at Bus Depot). it went on like a charm, everything lined up, knew right
then something
&gt; wasn't right.
&gt; today I had to get some welding done on another part of the exhaust
&gt; system, and while under there grabbed the tailpipe (not very hard) and it
&gt; broke off!!  it wasn't the weld either but the metal of the end of the
&gt; muffler just cracked!
&gt; well got that welded back up but certainly leaves me wondering how many
&gt; DAYS this muffler is gonna last.
&gt; Hey Ron is there anything better actually avaliable?????


If you have a '72-74, or a '79-up, you can use an OE system which is much
better.  If you have a '75-78, you can do the same but only if you buy new
heat exchangers or have a good crossover pipe.

The problem with the stock system for '75-78 is that the crossover pipe that
is part of it is no longer available. So if you have a good crossover pipe,
I can send you a nice quality Ansa or Bosal muffler for $79 that will last
just about as long as the original.  But if your crossover pipe is shot, you
can't use the stock replacement because you will have nothing to bolt it to.
And even if your crossover pipe is good now, once it rusts out you'll still
be in the same situation because you can't get a replacement pipe.

Which brings us to the Pacesetter, a one-piece alternative which does away
with the crossover pipe.  It is the better (or least bad) of the aftermarket
alternatives.  Most of the ones I've seen (such as the Empi and Bugpack)
have tailpipes that are acually _crimped_ on rather than welded; within a
couple of months the crimps burst at the seams and the whole end of the
muffler starts to come off, tailpipe and all. By comparison I have not had
any real problems with the Pacesetter. It is definately not OE quality but
this is the first I've ever heard of anything like a tailpipe breaking off.
At $79 I wouldn't call it amazing but it's the best I've found.

Your other alternative is a stock '72-74 exhaust system.  At $159, the O.E.
style Jopex system from Denmark is very well made and much nicer than the
Pacesetter.  If you have a '72-74 or a '79-83, it will bolt right on
(although it does away with the catalytic used on '79-83; see below).  If
you have a '75-78, you will need to buy '72-74 heat exchangers to use this
system.  But it's almost worth it considering that by doing so, you will
permanently eliminate not only that unavailable crossover pipe but also all
of the heat-exchanger-to-head piping on the '75-78 which is also no longer
available.  So you make the change once, and from then on, you have a
better, cheaper, heat exchanger/exhaust setup.  Indeed, throughout Europe,
this is the configuration that was used on all busses thru '79.  Only we in
the U.S. were fortunate enough to get the convoluted system that VW gave us
from '75 on.

If you need a catalytic converter, your other option is a '79-83 49-state
system (which also requires you to replace your '75-78 heat exchangers with
'72-74 ones, if your bus is a '75-78).  This runs $399 including the cat,
and is no better than the $159 system above except that uses a cat.

This is the type of information that is included (along with diagrams and
part numbers) in my new print catalog, which is $1.00 if added to any
purchase.
