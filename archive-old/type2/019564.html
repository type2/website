Subject: Melting HT leads.

I spent last week trogging round the Peak District and mid-Wales in the
van with the missus and the dogs.  Why is it all the nice places are so
hilly?  The van performed well until the very last day...

I just before we set off home we went hunting for a set of standing
stones up some bloody great hills, and the van seemed a little
under-powered, resorting to first gear for the first time that week
(auto tranny.)  It was subtle, I put it down to a hundred and one
things, resolving to check that my recently set points, valves and
timing hadn't slipped once I got home.

She continued to feel under powered, growing weedier and weedier on the
motorway home, until I realised that the vague uneasiness that had been
crawling over me was the blowing sound from the engine bay -- like a
blowing exhaust.

We pulled over and I checked her over -- nothing to see.  She was
running on three (well, two and a half) with cyls 1 and 2 popping along
nicely but 4 only on half time and 3 just not firing at all.  Spark
looked good, fuel couldn't be it, I thought (one 32/36 Weber carb.) 
There were no ominous clanking or rattling sounds.

Being only 40 miles from home I decided to let her cool and nurse her
home.

I got home and opened the engine bay to find that the inlet manifold to
cyl 3 (32/36 Weber, remember) was very hot.  Not discoloured but hot
enough to burn my hand, and hot enough to melt the number 3 HT lead. 
She's cooling now.  I'm hoping valve adjustment, praying not valve or
head damage.

VanFest is in two weeks, so that's my target.

*sigh*

We had a great time, though.

Chris.
