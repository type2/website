If you need the function of the fuel tank sump in the later fuel injected bus 
fuel tanks but don't want to switch to a later tank, Miller Fuel Injection 
offers a separate aluminum (I think) sump tank that he sells as an option for 
his CIS fuel injection conversion kits. He may sell them separately. 
(http://www_dot_millerfi_dot_com/)


You also may be able to use the small plastic sump tank that the VW Fox has 
mounted with the fuel pump and filter under the car.
