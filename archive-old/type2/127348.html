&gt; I note that some 80's watercooled Vanagon owners have slotted in subaru
&gt; engines and such.

I've seen buses with small block V8s protruding from the engine bay.

This isn't a weekend project, though.

The most successful conversions seem to be to Corvair, Subaru, or inline
Toyota or VW engines.  Aircooled purists prefer the Corvair, boxer purists
prefer the Subaru, VW purists prefer the inline VW engines, and the
heathens go for the Toyotas!  :)
