&gt;Does anyone know anything about using this terminal? I know that mine is

&gt;have no idea how to interpret the current in the various connections in
&gt;the terminal. Any ideas on where I could find specs? Has anyone ever
&gt;seen one of the diagnostic analyzers for sale?

Although not a complete description, here's what i know about it.

There are some wires connected to the battery and charging system, most wires
that are exclusively used for this diagnosis plug are strange color combinations.
On later 1600s there's also a sort of sensor in the bellhousing, this has to do with 
the diag system as well, it has tree thin wires to a round plug. Anyway, the big
square plug also has a ground connection and a think red wire to the battery +, 

I once went to see one of the Diag machines, it was advertised in a local VW 
club magazine, asking price was 750 Dutch Guilders, something like $450us,
I didn't buy it as they couldn't garantee me it worked, it was about 1.80 meters
high by 2 meters wide, 0.5 meters deep, it still had lots of cables and connectors
to be able to hook it up to non diag connector cars. The machine takes some 
base settings of off square cards with holes punched in them, every VW had
a specific number somewhere, that number corresponded with a certain card
which had to be inserted to the machine, there was also a little printer built into
the cabinet, which could print reports. I'm sure this thing could measure dwell,
charging voltage and amps, things like that, it also measured the pulses in
the current to the starter motor, ignition disabled, engine turning on starter 
motor, the machine compared the current necessary to turn the motor through
the four compression strokes to eachother and maybe also to data on the punch
card.
