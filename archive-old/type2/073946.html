Subject: Re: [T2] ball joints - thanks

Hi Folks,

Thanks for all the responses!  We finally got the stud popped loose from the 
steering nuckle.  It took a fair amount of heat and a fair amount of beating 
with the big hammer, but it finally popped loose.  My buddy now swears by 
the &quot;heat &amp; hammer&quot; method of loosening stubborn parts, and I can certainly 
see how useful they are.

BTW, the hardest part of the job was installing the new torsion arms -- it 
took us 3 tries to get both uppers on and set.  Lots of levering, hammering, 
grunting, and swearing was needed, but now the Bus is back together and 
cruising better than ever!

Once again, thank you for your support.

Jason
