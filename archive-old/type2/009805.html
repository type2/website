&gt; Sorry to be so late in joining this discussion. I basically agree with
&gt; your ideas. I think the first such support network that I'd heard of
was 
&gt; the BMWMOC (Motorcycle Owners Club). They have a book called Anonymous
&gt; or something and the listees are only listed by city and first name
and
&gt; what they can offer. There's some merit to the anonymity. It takes
away
&gt; the possibilities of having the list used for purposes other than the
&gt; original intent. (Ever hear of SPAM?)
&gt; I'm personally not very shy or reclusive but everyone has their own
&gt; limits and I fear that with a web-based public list we'd have a lot
less
&gt; volunteers.
&gt; Still, I'd support most anything you want to do. It sure woulda helped
&gt; me a few times!

I floated a similar idea some time back, but decided to shelve it in
favor of the Limbo book.

However, in the intervening time, I have come to realize that the
Type2 list has become a sizable organization of its own, and having
two parallel systems wouldn't be all that bad.  The flexibility of a
web-based resource would be a valuable asset.

The privacy concern is a valid one, but this could be addressed in a
couple of ways.

One way is to have a web server that requres the user to input a
request for a specific city or other geographical area.  It would then
return the information for only that area.  This would make it hard to
harvest the database for spamming purposes.  The information is only
useful to a spammer if it is accessible all in one place.  If we
require the user to input several requests, the information becomes at
least as secure as that in the archives.  The server could also verify
that the user is a listee and could even restrict it to listees who
have been on the list for a period of months.  Any HTML gurus care to
comment on my pipe dream?

Another way is to have a &quot;dispatcher&quot; who would accept requests by
email and forward the pertinent information to the requester.  I'm not
happy with this approach as it ties down a person and lengthens the
response time required.

I think that this is an idea whose time has come.
