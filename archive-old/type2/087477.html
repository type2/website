Subject: Re: [T2] torsion arm install

Question: on a 1972 bus I am reinstalling the torsion arms after putting in 
new balljoints. for the top arm should I remove the torsion bar and put the 
arm on that then install that, or how do you get the arm to slide on the bar 
and twist up over the bumper stop. It was a bit of work getting it off and I 
knew a problem to get on. thanks for your help
