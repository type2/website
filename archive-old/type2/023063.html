&gt;Hey David, yeah I remember you mentioning this before.  Fresh air duct to 
&gt;your carb.  But what about to the fan inlet?  Can you seal the fan to a 
&gt;fresh air duct?  I seems like it would help a lot.  The only problem I see 
&gt;is that there's not 6 inches of space in front of an upright fan so you'd 
&gt;have to flatten the 6&quot; duct back there.  So my question remains: is this 
&gt;enough air?

Oops, guess I didn't read closely enough - sorry.  My personal opinion is 
that any duct hooked up to the main cooling fan would restrict airflow too 
much, but I have no hard data to back that up.  I would concentrate on 
making sure your tin is well sealed (anyone tried ceramic-coating their 
tin?) instead.
