Subject: Headlight Trim Ring Screw Got any?

I need 2 of these buggers. If anyone has 2 they can spare or if they can
tell me the spec on them I would be most appreciative. I live in Arlington,
VA and don't mind driving to get them. I think they are like 4mm in
diameter but whats the thread and how long are they? And how likely is it
that FLAPS would stock???
