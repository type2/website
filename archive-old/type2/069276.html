To clarify a bit for those who have wondered.

1. obviously only good on a fuel injected car where you could disable
fuel to the &quot;pump&quot; cylinder by pulling the injector wire, and possibly
the cold start injector wire as well for safety, could in fact just
put a bitty switch in each to make it easy.  Carbed and diesels, tough
luck.

2.  Would also need a 1 way valve, more than easy enough to come
buy or make, a spring loaded ball valve made out of brass off the
shelf plumbing fittings and a bearing should be doable from your
hardware store for less than $5, this plus a $10 compression tester
or a &quot;valve holding pressure fitting&quot; for changing stem seals in OHV
engines with some air line and fittings, all told maybe $25 max I
figure.

3.  obviously not a great idea to be removing installing plug in warm
head, but hey got to do what you got to do, get some new crush washers.

4.  Seems to me the optimal method for speed of pumping, and the
engine will run soundly at idle on 3 without much worry for the
amount of time it ever would.
