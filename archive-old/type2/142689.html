&gt; THe diagrams for buses that are a little older are wonderful...somewhere
&gt; along 75 or so, they changed the method that that used to draw them and
&gt; they stink....maybe because things started getting much more complicated
&gt; in later models with FI and lots of other electrical goodies.

&gt;     IIRC, the wiring diagram for my ol' '52 Chevy pickup had under a dozen
wires...No turn signals, one brake light, off/on heater switch, no etc... ;-)
