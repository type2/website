&gt; FWIW I still don't agree with the &quot;trailer tire&quot;

Actually, they are truck rated tires.

&gt; I'm not sure
&gt; where the highway rib= trailer tire thought
&gt; began, except that very few passenger tires made
&gt; in the last few decades do not have the all
&gt; season rating.

Quite a few truck tires do, unfortunately.  If you buy a set of Hercules
185R14 in passenger rating they have the M+S stamp.  If you buy the
same tire in load range C or D it won't have the stamp despite the fact
that it has exactly the same tread pattern.  Go figure!


  Personally I would insist on at
&gt; least M+S ratings, and would prefer an all
&gt; terrain tire.  Thus, I wouldn't favor the
&gt; Bridgestone or the Yoko, but lotsa folks prefer
&gt; the smooth ride and low noise of these highway
&gt; rib tires.

That would be me.  I even prefer highway to &quot;all terrain&quot; treads on
off-pavement excursions as they will spin without digging a hole.  If you
don't have a lot of power you don't want an aggressive tread.

Now, if confronted with a snow tire control area I would prefer a M+S
tire, and I keep a pair of Uniroyal Laredos on spare rims for those
occasions.  I didn't like the Laredos because of uneven wear, so they only
go on for snow.
