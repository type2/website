Subject: Re: [T2] Charcoal Canister

If that is the charcoal canister in the fuel vapor system that smoke is
explosive gas vapors.  sparks  not recommended.  The absolute best way
is to replace it. 175 201 801A (73-79 bus) at busdepot.  Others probably
have them as well.  that is just where i found it last time.

properly remove this and plug up the holes without causing harm to
