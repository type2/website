&gt; Who was it that said they got the bilge blower from Home Depot? I

&gt; looking at HD can you give me a name/part number?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!

It was online at the home depot website that I found the attwood blower, 
but regardless, the stock blower still seems more powerful than two 
attwood blowers.
