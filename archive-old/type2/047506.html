Subject: Re: [T2] R12 Availability?

Good point, i've never done the conversion but i know why some have
problems with leaks. The hoses for r 12 won't hold the new chemicals and
they must be upgraded as well . I think the new lines are called barrier
hoses? someone correct me if i 'm wrong here. I forgot to mention this.
Sooner or later though if you want a/c the conversion will have to be
done. I'm sure replacing those lines is a tedious process.
Good luck, hope a solution is found.

&gt; Have you actually ever converted an old R12 system
&gt; that worked more than a year without leaking?
