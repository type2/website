    Oh yeah, me too. But a little richer mixture will go a long way to prevent
that, and, like I said, if you have to, just raise the octane a bit. It's
worth buying a little more expensive fuel if you can get a good bit more
power. And the higher compression is also going to mean you are gettting a
more efficient burn, so that helps to even out the price per mile end of it.
I'll bet there's an awful lot of VW's running 8.5:1 heads. Even out in the
desert.
      I think the latter day stock VW ratios are more a reflection of meeting
smog requirements then they are about engine effiency or even longevity.  On
the one hand, a lower compression ratio should definitely be longer lived, all
else being even, but definitely not  more effient or powerful.
     I'd definitly go for it if I was building a more powerful non-stock
engine., unless I decided to put in a turbo instead. Heck, it ain't going to
be that shorter lived.  Or just go for that Subi, I could sure go for some
water heat, as well.

     Hmm, that's a thought. Maybe just throw a turbo on this stock puppy.
Hmm, did any of those Subaru's come turboed??? Anybody know any good turbo
sites?
