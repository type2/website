Subject: Frustration in Florida

I think if I can't fix my bus, I'm going to totally go nuts on it. I'll 
paint it bright yellow, make a periscope out of PVC piping and write &quot;We 
all live in a yellow submarine...&quot; on the side.

And then I'll hang out in it every night and have an extension cord going 
into to the house so I can power my fan, stereo, etc. inside the 
bus.  Then, after I'm nice and tired of it, I'll take out the engine and 
crap and turn it into a garden.  Haha.

THEN I will try and sell it....

Ok, I'm just blowing off steam, I'm sure...  But I really need to find 
myself something to use as a daily driver instead of my '72 bus... I love 
her dearly, but poor college kids like myself can't always afford to take 
as much care of these things as we'd like sometimes.  Le sigh...
