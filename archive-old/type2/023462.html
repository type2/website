I've posted pictures from last weekend's Circle Yer Wagons VW show at
Sevierville, Tenn. This is a twice-a-year event with an emphasis on bus-
camping. I was busy sewing custom hats all weekend in my booth, buy my son
managed to take some photos with my new digital camera with an emphasis on bus
photos. Click on VW pages on the bottom of my homepage for the photos.

If you see your bus and would like to send me a private email with some info
you want added to the photo, please feel free to do so. Hope you enjoy the
photos.

We will be at Farmington, NC this Sunday (Oct 11th) with Type 2 and Vanagon
List hats and my son will again take some pictures for me to publish.
