Subject: No oil filter

I  was suprised to find out that the new 1600 mexican VW engine I'm having 
installed does not have an oil filter. It seems most people agree that you 
should have one. There wasn't one one the newly rebuilt one that gave up the 
ghost on me my first day of ownership either, but I want one. I asked the the 
mechanic doing my insall to put one on it, and he said that it would void the 
12 month/12k warranty, so we should wait until it's out of warranty. I'm 
suprised that something built brand new doesn't have one, and I would love 
some feedback on how some of the rest of you feel.
