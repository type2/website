Subject: RE: Dog house/external cooler

Nick,

I'd have to say that I agree with Uffe's response to you. I also agree
with your observation that a dog house LOOKS inefficient, but it does
work. And quite well at that.

I don't pretend to know squat about all the different coolers
available, only what I've learned from my own trial and errors. 

I installed a doghouse on my '69 Westy with a stock 1600. I have
cylinder head temp (attached to #3), oil temp and oil pressure gauges
and this is what they showed me....

Oil temp....NO CHANGE, NONE.

Oil pressure...dropped about 10-15 pounds at idle; no change while
driving.

Cylinder temp....BIG CHANGE, about 15-20 degrees LOWER!!

The doghouse wasn't designed to cool the oil better, but to keep the
#3 cylinder from overheating.

Also, I'm not sure what piece of tin you refer to, but my doghouse is
totally enclosed except for where the air comes from the fan inside
the cooling tin.

I don't dissagree that an external oil cooler is a bad idea. I live in
Arizona and it gets hotter than hell here (I recently drove my bus in
115 degree heat), so I definately keep my mind open to *any* ideas of
how to keep it cool. However, I agree that mounting it where it will
pre-heat the air that cools the motor itself is self-defeating. One of
the coolest set-ups I've seen is on a fellow listees '71 and is
mounted underneath the body. I believe it is a Berg unit.
