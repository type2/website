Subject: Westy parts into transporter

Westyites,
U've prob. heard this before:

Got a '68 bus.
Found a '70 junked westy.
How much of the westy camping equip. can i use in the
bus? 

I want the bed and the camper windows, at least.

The popup's in good condition, can I just cut a hole
in the roof and mount it? (sumthin tells me that's not
a good idea.)

Glen
