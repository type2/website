A similar story:

During my days as a fireman, I once weased a ride in a crash truck: a
super humongous fire-battle vehicle with watter turrets controlled from
within the cab, designed to go right up to a burning plane and
take care of business.

Anyway, in city traffic, there was this fake blond, high-maintenance 
blond betty, cigarette in one hand, cel phone in the other, in very
new Merceses something-SL, dashing across lanes, honking at people,
being a bitch in general.

We ended up next to her at a light, after watching her petulant display
of driving impatience.

Light turns green, and the engineer, a crusty old fart from the &quot;old-school&quot;
says, out loud, &quot;smoke THIS, bitch&quot; and slams the throttle.  I have no idea
what size the engine (diesel, mounted midship) was on that beast, but the 
exhaust was almost big enuf to get lose a volleyball in.  And that huge
tailpipe was pointed right at her ear.  The truck (technically, _engine_) 
didn't go anywhere, but it spewed a HUGE volume of thick, black soot all 
over this betty and her new car.  We made it all the way across the 
intersection before the smoke cleared, and looked back to see that she hadn't
even _moved_ - sitting there with this stunned look on her face, soot all 
over her and her new car!

An image I'll never forget: I wish I could do that in the bus.
