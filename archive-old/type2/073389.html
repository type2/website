&gt;    With that knowledge in mind, I am wondering if a rebuild kit is
&gt;available and if so where and what would the part number be.

Did you check busdepot_dot_com?  Bus Boys?  Rocky Mountain Motorworks?
Wolfsburg West?  Local FLAPS?

&gt;If a kit is
&gt;not available to rebuild would I need anything other than the gaskets,
&gt;flange, and push rod.

Uh, yes, you need the diaphragm.

&gt;If so what else would I need.  Also if any listees
&gt;have a good or new OEM pump for sale please send me mail, perhaps this might
&gt;be easier. Again it is for a 1973 type2 carbureted.

Any pump for 72-74 carburated type IV bus engines will work.

&gt;in response to Tommy's post about putting the inline engine in my diesel
&gt;van.  I had thought of this since I do have a good wasserboxer 1.9l engine,

The wasserboxer is not an inline engine.  I must have missed his post, but
the engines to bolt in are the rabbit/golf/jetta 4-cylinder engines.  There
should be plenty of info on that in the archives.
