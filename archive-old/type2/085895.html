Subject: Re: [T2] Starting Problems


If that(checking your cable connections) doesn't do the trick, check the 
ground strap from the tranny to the frame.  Also, check to make sure the 
solenoid is really receiving 12v from the ignition switch.  Check all your 
fuse block connections and clean them if needed.  You may have too much 
resistance in the long wire from the ign. sw. to the starter(usually caused 
by corrosion.  One way to get around this is to add a 30A, SPDT Bosch relay 
to the circuit.  I have done this to my '70, and it works great.

&gt;My 70 PopTop wont turn over unless I hook jumpers cables up to the
&gt;battery... Battery is good, but she wont turn over any suggestions??
