Subject: Re: [T2] It was running when I parked it...

I've got a good 'when we parked it' story of missed  opportunity.   When I lived in Houston several years ago, I  had a friend in his early 70's.  He told me that after his father  died in the 1970 his mother never learned to drive.  They just  left his mid-60's model VW Bus sitting in the shed out behind the  house.  Jack had no interest in living in Peoria, IL so he stayed  in Houston.  After I moved back here in 1991, his mother died (in  her 90's) and he moved back to Peoria into the house.  He also  inherited some cash to make up for the absence of work for jazz  drummers in Peoria.  He said the bus was still there and looked  practically brand new.  Like I said, Jack was a jazz drummer all  his life and never was very mechanical.  (Yeah, a drummer!)   After I bought my bus he came through and visited me and said if I  wanted it, he'd sell it to me for $300.  But he didn't know what  I'd have to do to get it to run.  I told him I'd come up and spend  a week with him
 and try to figure it out or figure a way to get it down  here.  Well, Jack passed away a few months ago and I never got up  there.  Have no idea who in the extended family got the house or  the bus.  I'm not in touch with anyone that knows them.  Just  my luck.  Cheers...KR
