You can double click on each message and when it pops up go to file and hit
&quot;save as&quot;. Make yourself a folder on the desktop or whereever and save the
message to that folder. You could make subfolders like engine tires breakes
etc. Then when you get full just save that folder to a floppy disk or if
your up to speed like me burn it on a cd. When you open a file it uses
Outlook express, but you don't have to store it in OE anymore. You can then
delete it and save hard drive space. Hope this helps.

&gt; List-
&gt; Someone previously suggested sorting techniques
&gt; and storage procedures for the Huge Volume of Mail
&gt; that these bus lists produce.
&gt; My PC is rapidly approaching critical mass ( i believe
&gt; that Outlook Express has a limit ) and i would prefer
&gt; to personally archive my collection and not delete it,
&gt; but also have ready access to the history.
&gt; If this is a suitable Friday topic, then perhaps the
&gt; resident geeks can instruct the PC-challenged among us
&gt; into a more efficient manner of dealing with the mail
&gt; and keep more of us on board.
