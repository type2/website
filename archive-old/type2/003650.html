&gt;Beth sends:
The other thing is, a friend of mine told me I need to have a
&gt;&gt; special &quot;sping removal&quot; tool otherwise I will not be able to get the
&gt;&gt; springs off. Is this true?  Thanks in advance for any help.  Beth and
&gt;&gt; &quot;Prudence&quot; the '78 bus in NJ.
&gt;
&gt;Volkswagens don't have lug nuts. They have lug bolts, or more specifically
&gt;lug bolts that weld themselves to the brake drums.
