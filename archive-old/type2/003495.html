&gt;Ron, the new German heat exchangers arrived today. In words of one
&gt;syllable - WOW!
&gt;People, when was the last time any of us saw a brand spankin' new German
&gt;Heat Exchanger?That's what I thought. Well, I just received two brand
&gt;new ones courtesy of Ron. They arrived in perfect shape.
&gt;
&gt;Ron, thanks again for a good deal. I'm tempted to get another pair. What
&gt;are the chances? Any left?


I have about ten pair left at this point.  I will try to get more when
they're gone but am not sure if I can.
(And even if I can, it won't be for a couple of months.)
