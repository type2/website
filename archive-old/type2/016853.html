Subject: VW AC for Camping
Message-ID: &lt;367EF0D9.1F5712DE_at_gte_dot_net&gt;

I've gotten a lot of private e-mail responses on my comments referring
to converting my overhead AC unit into a 115v compatible system for
camping. This may seem strange to those of you with gas powered heaters
on your mind, but it's still in the 80's here in Florida, and Joe Clark
and the rest of us in the Tropics need a way to keep our Pina Coladas
and Sweaty Bodies cool during camping trips.

Here's my response to Joe, who asked me about my &quot;system in the works&quot;
and was wondering about installing a window AC in his bus:

&quot; I also thought about a window AC unit, but where
to put it baffled me. Rear window glass seems to be the first notion,
but
you lose much/all rear vision and opening the hatch would be almost
impossible. Driver's side rear glass was the next thought, but in order
to
have clearance outside, you must pretty much bring the unit inside and
partially enclose it in a cabinet vented to the outside. So, unless the
cabinet is well insulated, you bring almost all of the AC noise into the

cabin, and you lose valuable cabin space because of the cabinet. Plus,
the
butt side of an ac unit is, well, butt ugly.

So, I thought about an RV AC unit on top of the van. For about 2
seconds. Do
I want that much weight on the top of a vehicle that acts like a
sailboat on
the Interstate during a good Florida thunderstorm? Do I want to add to
the
height of my van and knock the unit off next time I try to park in short

time parking at the airport? Do I want to pay what the silly dealers
want
($600+)  when I can get a window unit for $200? How am I going to strap
my
canoe to the roof on the next camping trip? On and on.

So, I thought about central air, like a house has, with part of the unit

outside and part of it inside. I was going to take a window unit apart,
mount one coil inside, another outside, the compressor in the engine
compartment, and then realized, &quot;Hey, that's what I have now with the
12v VW
engine powered AC!!&quot; I just have to get it to work with the campground
electricity.

I have the overhead (but inside) unit with the condenser mounted beneath
the
vehicle and cooled by 2 12v fans. I asked my AC Engineer VW buddy if it
was
possible to change out the engine driven ac compressor with an electric
driven one. The answer was positive, and there are options.

1. Keep the engine driven compressor, but belt it to a 115V motor.

2. Replace the driven compressor with a 115V compressor.

3. Keep the compressor on line and add a 115v compressor in the line
with
valves that can separate either from the system. The valves could be
manually changed over at the campground or solenoid operated automatic
changeover would be possible as soon as 115v is available.

#3 sounds like the best because you don't lose the system when you are
without 115V.

The 12v fans that cool the outside coil and that circulate cooled air
inside the cabin will have to have a 12v supply in any case, so an
onboard converter/charger will be needed. No big deal. I use an
automatic charger and dual batteries now so that I can use my 12v
lights, fans and stereo on campouts without worrying about losing
startup ability.

However, I may go with only the 115v AC compressor since I am seriously
considering an onboard power generator and this would lighten the load
on
the VW engine.

Right now,  Eddie, my ac friend, is looking to find the most efficient
compressor for the job. Light weight, low draw and yet powerful enough
to
provide the needed pressure for the system. I'm working on the best
possible
location for the generator I now own. I'm toying with the idea of
mounting
it to the front bumper behind a brush guard/off-road light carrier.
It'll
look like something from National Geographic or VW of Mexico. LOL.

I'll keep you posted as to progress.
