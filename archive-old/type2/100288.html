Subject: Ignition LOCK trouble

Hi Folks,

It figures that my Bus starts to act up just before I embark on a 
cross-country move...

The post/thread started by David Schwarze is similar (but different) to a 
problem that Sweet Pea (1979 Westy) developed this past weekend.  My 
ignition lock (not the switch, but the part the key goes into) has always 
been a bit sticky, and recently became much more difficult now that the 
temperature has been going below 20F.  Thinking I was helping things, I 
squirted WD-40 in the lock, and presto! the lock stopped working altogether. 
  After 5 minutes of wiggling, twisting, tapping with a hammer, and using my 
favorite curse words, it worked.

The next day I put lock de-icer in it to clean out the WD-40, then used 
graphite lubricant, and it started working better.  I pulled out the Bentley 
manual and went over the procedure, but was stuck once again.  First, how do 
you disconnect the washer hoses?  Second, is there any way to remove the 
plastic housing besides cutting it?  Third, even if I get the whole thing 
disassembled, Bentley mentions using an Easy-Out on a shear bolt, drilling a 
hole in the lock mechanism, and using a piece of wire to release a spring -- 
is this REALLY the procedure that VW used??

Granted, I'm currently using a 2nd-generation key on a 23-year-old lock.  
But, if I get the code number off of the lock, will a locksmith-made 
brand-new key work better?  Do I really need to go thru this hell and 
replace the ign lock?  I'm almost tempted to re-wire it so the ignition and 
starter switches are on the dash....

Thanks for any help or suggestions.
