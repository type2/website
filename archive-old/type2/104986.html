Subject: Re: [T2] Got my second bus tonight

&gt; My daughter came by today, I think she wants my 75 bus. Anyone ever 
&gt; teach someone how to drive in a bus? I'm considering letting her have it 
&gt; after I get a few more bugs worked out of it but I'm worried about her 
&gt; having it as her first car.

I taught my wife to drive my bus when we only had 1 car.
I would drive it 50 Miles round trip for my day job and she would drive it 50 
Miles round trip for her night job.
She insisted if it would &quot;go&quot; 75 then why couldn't she drive it that fast all 
the time.
The engines didn't last as long in those days as they do now that I am the 
sole driver.
I never let her drive it anymore which is what she wanted in the first place!
