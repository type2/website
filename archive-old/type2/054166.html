W -

Did you take into account that your odometer runs slower as well? It'll show
less miles per tankful, and therefore artificially lower your MPGs.

&gt;  My actual change has been from 20.5mpg average over the past 15000
&gt; miles to 19.75mpg over the last three tankfuls (670 miles). Three
&gt; tankfuls is a small sample- we'll see what happens in time.
