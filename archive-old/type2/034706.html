Subject: seats for my 68
Content-Disposition: inline

Hi all! Last week I purchased what I've wanted since I was 13: a 1968 VW Bus! I plan on restoring my dream Bus but for now my main intent is to get it drivable. I bought it without an engine, but I already have that lined up. The PO put in front seats from an early 80's VW that just don't belong there. Does anyone have any seats in pristine condition (preferably low-back) for sale? Thanks! BTW I'm a newbie both to VW's and this great list!

James, 68 Std.
