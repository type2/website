My Portugese isn't just lousy, it's non-existent.  However, if I'm guessing
right the school bus model seats 15 [fifteen!!] bodies including the
&quot;motorista&quot;.  This must be a record for a VW bus in a factory-built
configuration.  I can't begin to visualize the seating layout for children,
let alone adults.

It's also interesting that the tire spec. is still 185R14C.

The max. HP is listed as ~57 _at_ 4200RPM, and a top speed of 120KPH.  I
expected a bit more, given the modern FI, etc.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  The water-cooled busses sold in Mexico are made in Brasil. They also
build air-cooled ones for the home
market. Your choice of gas or alcohol.  &lt;&lt;
