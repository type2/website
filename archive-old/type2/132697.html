Subject: RE: [T2] CDI question - Spark PLug Gap

I thought there was an issue running a hotter coil with points being
that the points would pit and wear down faster. Am I incorrect? I
understand that the CDI would just use the points as a trigger, so
that's not a problem.

&gt; The original coil's voltage is/was limited by the mechanical points. A
&gt; pointless trigger mechanism (such as a pertronics unit) now allows you
&gt; to run a hotter (higher voltage) coil.

not quite right. the points are just a trigger system. you can run a
hotter coil or cdi with points just fine. the advantages of a pointless
system are. a) no dwell adjust b) they dont wear out (but they do break
:)
) c) pretty immune to mechanical faults in the disributor like sloppy
shaft etc.
