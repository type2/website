Subject: Order to put rocker panels on, inner first, outer second??

As you can tell by my question, I'm going to be learning as I go. I am thinking I need to put the inner rockerpanels on first, (I've purchased the pre-notched easy on ones). I'm assuming that once they are in place, I'll be able to align the outside rockers properly so as to look good?? Also, what the heck is the point of the middle rocker panels?? Could they be left out? Anyone who has done this, would appreciate the info, especially about the middle rockers.
Thanks,
Courtney
