&gt; &gt; Any bus with L-Jetronic should adjust very well to displacement changes, while

&gt; can never &gt;remember which years came with which system.

&gt; I think the 75-83 Buses had the L-Jetronic, while Type 3 and perhaps type 4 cars
&gt; d-Jetronic (like 67-73?) The D-Jetronic would come into play if you switched in
&gt; a 411 or
&gt; 412 sedan motor into your bus and wanted to keep Fuel Injection. Would D-Jet
&gt; work in a bus?
&gt; Is anyone drivng one with this system? I rebuilt a 71 411 &quot;W&quot; code 1700 for my
&gt; 73 bus and

My spare engine is a 1700 from a 71 411 sedan, I use a complete L-Jetronic
on it, works fine.   needs rebuilding but doesn't have anything to do with
the fuel injection
