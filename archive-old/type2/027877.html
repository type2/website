To all those with an axe to grind:
I have never before purchased any parts from Bus Depot, but am convinced, 
thanks to all those who have written positive feedback messages about them, 
that I have not made a mistake. My bus needs a clutch kit and I saw that he 
had it for a price that, even after taxes and shipping charges, was thirty 
dollars less than the pre-tax price of the only FLAPS here that deals in VW 
parts. I could better afford to spend my dollars for parts via online 
shopping with him, thereby keeping the costs down on making this bus run 
well, than to buy them from a local vendor, which I will continue to do as 
long as there are available parts there in what coincidentally happens to be 
my home state.
And to you Ron, thanks ever so much for the discount, as it DOES make a 
difference.
