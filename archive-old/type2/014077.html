&gt; &gt;It is feasible to keep warm using electric heat if you concentrate it on
&gt; &gt;thre body- I successfully used an inverter (300-500 watt ones cost
&gt; &gt;$50-100) to power 2 electric lap blankets (160 watts on high) which you
&gt; &gt;wrap over your lap as you drive.  Great for the passengers, no problem
&gt; &gt;for the alternator.
&gt; 
&gt; That 320 watts is drawing 30 amps from your 55 amp alternator (55% of its 
&gt; peak capacity) continuously.  Might not be a problem in the short term, but 
&gt; at night (when headlights are drawing an additional 10 amps) you will 
&gt; likely approach or exceed the rating of your alternator.  In this case, 
&gt; your battery will not charge and may even discharge, and you risk 
&gt; overheating or burning out your alternator.  If you can, try and find 12V 
&gt; blankets to eliminate the conversion losses from the inverter - that will 
&gt; help.  You might also beg/borrow/steal an inductive ammeter to see what is 
&gt; really going on with your alternator and battery - it may suprise you.

If you're feeling particularly flush, head on down to a motorcycle shop that carries touring gear.  They have electric vests, chaps and even 
complete electric suits.  If two of these (rider and passenger) can run on a motorcycle alternator, even a 38A generator shouldn't have 
trouble keeping up!
