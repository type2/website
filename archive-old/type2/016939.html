    I'd strongly encourage you to just totally forget that engine, and
get a Type-4 2.0L engine complete with FI. I've got a '81 2.0L in my '73
westy, and it goes pretty well, I'd have no problems in the Rockies. I
can cruise at 75 all day in the flat country, and in fact it often hits
80 before I notice and ease up a bit. I've got a ring &amp; pinion from a
later 091 tranny in my 002 tranny, so it's a bit higher geared than the
stock '72-73 tranny, but I drove it at 75 with the stock tranny as well.
With the lower geared stock tranny you have, the uphills would be even
easier. 
    The Type-4 engines are not just bigger, but far more robust than the
earlier engines, and if I thought I needed more power, I'd opt for turbo
on this engine.
