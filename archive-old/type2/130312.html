Subject: Re: [T2] sleeping in a Bay Bus

&lt;Anyone tell me what is a good way to improve the matress situation 
&lt;in the bus???
&gt;
&gt;One of the problems we have is that for some reason our backs hurt 
&gt;after sleeping in the bus.

This probably doesn't apply to your situation since a 78 Westy layout is
completely different than a 1973 layout, but I'll toss it in anyway.  In my
73 I found that if I stuffed a rolled-up towel between the back of the
mattress and the rear hatch door that it would hold the rear mattress snugly
against the next mattress (the one attached to the fold-down seat) thus
removing the gap that would exist there otherwise.  Much easier on backs
that way.
