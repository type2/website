I have a buddy with an olds 350 with the tranny off an 84 buick Rivera.  I
know of some company that sells conversion kits to convert almost anything.
Does anybody know what company this is?  I really wanna do this!  Can
anybody give me any constructive advice on this.   Also can I use the tranny
off the Rivera?  It was a front wheel drive car.  Any advice would be
greatly appreciated.

Hi Chuck

If you get this thing to work then I want pictures of it for my site Wild
VW's at http://www.geocities_dot_com/motorcity/garage/1811 but I personally
believe that's a big IF....  I don't know anything about the Rivera but I'm
assuming that because it's front wheel drive the engine sits above the
transaxle, and not behind it like the VW setup.  That means serious
modifications just to make a whole big enough to fit the engine in the back
of the Bus and no doubt moving of the fuel tank and rear seat etc.

I run a V8 powered bus but use a seriously strong 2.0lt transaxle and have
the engine mounted where the VW engine normally is.  This is much much
easier than what you're thinking of doing.  Is the 350 in the Riviera an
alloy blocked engine?? if not all that weight could be a problem.  I run a
full alloy engine and that helps a lot.

Anyway, if you get it working I'd love the pictures, if not, well, someone
has to try it I guess ;)
Cheers
Steve
