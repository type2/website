Hi, 

As an enthusiast of VW's I hoped you may know someone interested
in buying a unique Van. I would prefer to sell it to someone
who can appreciate it as a VW.

69 VW Euro  import oversized van.  3 '  longer, 2 ' taller.
 Very fast 3.8 liter engine. (818) 225-9355 days  Large cargo area.
 See in Irvine.

The Kamperink Company made VW Transporter conversions for VW of Germany.
A transporter was stretched one meter (40&quot;) and raised to over
6'(inside).
It used all stock mechanical parts. It's a very clean and professional
result.

There are no hills in Holland where they work just fine. 
The current engine is a stock, hi-performance Buick V-6, 
increasing dispacement from the original 1600cc to 3800cc.
The starter and trans are stock VW and a VW engine can be
put back in, in 30 minutes. All the original VW wiring and
mechanical conections are untouched.  The Trans adaptor
was designed by Hadley Engineering of Costa Mesa, CA. I added Front
disk brakes.

It's a one of a kind VW Van.  I was a VW enthusiast, went to Europe in
1970, saw an oversized Van and fell in love with the Bestelwagen
Speciaal 
made by the Kamperink Company in Holland. I turned one into a camper and 
spent a year traveling in Europe.  It worked so well, I returned to
Holland, visited the factory and bought a second one which I shipped
home.  
I used this one as daily transportation during college then put a Buick
V-6 in it in 1989.  Since installing the new engine in '89, I have only
put a few thousand 
iles on it.

The cargo area is great.  A six foot man can stand up inside, it is 
wide enough for a queen sized bed, has a removable double stainless
steel sink, (had a propane refrig), propane forced air furnace, sliding
rooftop skyights, side and rear doors. Additional rear bumper with
motorcycle rack
and trailer hitch.  The interior accomodates full lenth windsurfer 
masts, full lenth boards (13&quot;).

The van has never been in an accident, body is straight, needs paint 
and rust work. Because of mostly sitting and rust, the brake system
needs complete cleaning although the drums, rotors amd pads are probably
still like new.

I hate to sell it but now live a couple of hours from where it's stored
in Irvine, and don't have a convenient place to park it where I'm now 
living.

Thank You,

Kevin Roberts 818-225-9355
