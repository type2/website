Subject: Air Cooled Search &amp; Rescue: Mission#1

Calling All Air-Cooled Search &amp; Rescue Forces:

        Your first mission is in South Dakota, United States. Time is of the
essence so listen carefully. According to the Sept. 22 Des Moines
Register newspaper in Des Moines, Iowa in the classified section - over
400 air-cooled vehicles are at stake. I quote:
        &quot;VW's  400+ mostly air cooled, cars to be disposed of this fall (605)
335-7704&quot;
        Doing a little detective work, it was determined that the phone number
given originated in South Dakota. A preliminary call to that number
determined that noone was home. Therefore details are sketchy. Your
mission, should you wish to accept it is to:
        1) Make contact with the unknown party
        2) Determine scope of problem and types of vehicles involved
and     3) Report back to the list ASAP what you have found.

        Thank you for your cooperation, and best of luck to you..
