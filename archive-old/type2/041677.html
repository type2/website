Hello listers,
	I am frantically trying to find a sofa-bed for my '81 Vanagon.  I know this
is not strictly within the pervue of the type2 list, but I don't want to
join the Vanagon list for this one thing.  I am going on a long trip this
summer, and have barely enough money for gas and food, so sleep must be as
free as possible.  The trouble is, these beds seem to be as hard to find as
a snowflake in the Sahara!  My trip is quickly looming before me, and it
looks like I'll be curled up on the floor for the trip.
	My question is:  Since I can't seem to find a used one anywhere, is there
anyplace that I can get one NEW!  I mean, Westfalia is still in production,
right?  It seems like they would supply their slightly older model campers
with replacement parts.  And it is not like I am trying to refit a '68
splitty camper or anything, this is an '81 Vanagon.  So, I am hoping that
someone out there knows if they do still make beds for '80s campers, and if
wo, where I can find them.
	Thank you all in advance for anything that you can tell me.
