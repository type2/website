Subject: RE: [T2] It started

Mike,

The '78 FI system should fire almost immediately when cold thanks to the
cold start valve. Actually, it is a pretty advanced system, it's just
attached to a very old design, the aircooled motor.

I hope I'm not hijacking the thread here since I don't have the previous
posts:

It sounds like your cold start valve is non operational or the harness plug
is unplugged. I have had to wiggle the plug a little bit on mine after I run
over rough roads and the plug (one clip is damaged) works loose. 

Low tech Cold Start Valve test:

Unplug the coil wire at the coil
Unplug the cold start harness plug
Pull the valve out of the intake manifold and point it into a small
container or some rags
Put on your safety glasses
Plug the harness plug back into the valve
Have a friend turn over the motor and if the valve sprays fuel into the
bucket and then the spray slowly subsides, the valve is working.

If not, then test the electrical connection to the valve using the Bentley's
steps

If it does work then move to the &quot;next&quot; trouble shooting steps.

Hope this helps,

Jon Stiles

No starting fluid necessary, but for a fuel injected engine it seems to take
a lot of cranking to fire and it seems pumping the throttle helps. This is
the way it's been since I've known her. Maybe I'm just used to modern FI
that fires almost immediately.
