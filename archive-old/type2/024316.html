Subject: vent window pin...
Message-ID: &lt;7k79db$7s12_at_eGroups_dot_com&gt;

hi, i need some advice concerning the side rear vent window...the bottom pin has like rusted completely away and when i opened the vent it almost fell out...well my question is...how do you take the window out of the frame? do you just pull it out?..what can i use for a pin...a nail? a rivet? finally..how do you fit the frame into the top and bottom pin holes at the same time...or do you have to affix the frame first and then stick the glass in? thanks..71 Westy...
