Subject: Dipstick Test, Fanshroud, and Engine Temps

Crawled all over the archives looking for the definitive procedure for
performing the &quot;dipstick test&quot; to try and get a &quot;feel&quot; for if and how hot my
bus is running.

I drove it into work today (about 31 miles mostly highway 60-70mph)  Went
back and did some feeling around in back when I got to work.

The fan shroud was warm.  Not uncomfortably warm but pretty warm.  I would
say hot shower warm.

Grabbing the dipstick where it enters the block was about the same.  Pulling
the dipstick out and touching the &quot;wet&quot; end was too hot to hold onto.

Now a fellow airhead here at work says the fanshroud should be &quot;cool&quot; to the
touch (personally I don't see how it could be colder than the ambient air at
best but he seemed to think that it was supposed to be that way)

I am new to aircooled engines and given that my bus has &quot;almost&quot; left me
stranded a few times already I am a little nervous about it.  I hate that
feeling of &quot;am I going to make it?&quot;

Engine Specs.
its an 1800cc block but I think that it is ultimately a 1925 CC displacement
engine (POs doing mentioned something about putting 102 porsche pistons in
it??) with a 2ltr EFI setup.  It may run warm to begin with.
It has good power, starts quick, runs strong with a hiccup here and there
but not under power that I have noticed.  I haven't checked the plugs yet to
see if its running rich or lean because I wasn't sure that there was a
problem yet.
The EGR filter has holes in it.  The throttle switch is disconnected and I
haven't checked the timing yet.  I was going to mess with that when I
convert to pertronix.
