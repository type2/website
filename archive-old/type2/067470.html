Subject: 110-12 V converter conked out

Alright! A real question to the list from the Ductape King do-it-yourselfer:
     My $50 yardsale bought 120 to 12V converter (50 AMP, P0 said it was
worth over $250) has conked out - it hums, so I'll pull it out from under
the seat and check for wiring flaws from transformer.  I ran everthing off
this (water pump, TV, VCR, interior lights, fans,  battery charger (for
camcorder), and could do it all at once, while old 4 amp one really was
poorly filtered for tv use.  I'd like to find out 2 things- (1) best deal
for converters filtered enough for electronic use and at least 10 Amps, and
(2)are there any electronics experts who can say whether an already in hand
battery charger (2-10 Amp) can be used if someones designs a filter for the
output?  I seem to remember that by itself the old 4 amp (for frig, which
dosn't work, so I unwired it)- it would create annoying patterns in tv
picture and possibly a hum, but if in parallel with the spare battery (like
charging it) it was less....the charger is DC output and certainly runs my
spark plug cleaner and lights and pumps.   Money is a factor here, so if I
can use the charger, I can limit power use all at once and get away with
it.  If not, who's got the best deal?
