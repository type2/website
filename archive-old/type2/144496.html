Subject: trouble starting my bus

Occasionally when I've tried starting my bus it doesn't turn over.  The
lights on the spedometer come on, and I hear the click from the engine 
when i try starting it.  Nothing else though.  I'll move the steering
wheel a little bit and she fires right up.  This morning ,however, I went
to start her and I got the single click from the engine and then nothing.
No power, no more clicks, no lights on the spedo, no nothing.  I then
have to get the kids out so they can help diagnose and assist (4 and 8
years old) and they suggest checking the oil or replacing the squirrel
cage fan :)  I opt for wiggling the battery connectors and other wires.
We now have lights on the spedo again and she fired right up.  The
battery connections weren't loose that i could tell.  Aside from knowing
that the issue is not the oil level or the squirrel cage fan as the kids
suggested :P I'm not sure where to start.
