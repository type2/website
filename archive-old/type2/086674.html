Oh yeah I sort of forgot about the Asbestos warning. Definately take heed
here. Either wear an approved respirator or make sure your pads are non
asbestos, most are these days, but you still need to check.

--Billy replies:

Yowza! watch out sanding possible asbestos carrying brake pads. I know
Theodore is pretty knowledgeable about his bus, but for newbies, this is
how you free asbestos into it's person-killing form. They say they're not
asbestos anymore, but most boxes still carry the warning!
