Subject: Re: Chasing the Miss

My miss turned out to be a confounded ground wire: one of those under the
main air box for the FI system. The thing was on it's plug, but feeling
around for air leaks, I tapped it and the engine stalled. Tightening of the
connector and reinstallation took care of the miss.

I still have some backfiring on decceleration, but at least I've got half
the problem solved. Oddly enough, I'm certain I don't have any exhaust or
vacuum leaks. I'm pretty sure that the backfiring has to do either with the
extractor muffler that's on there. I could be wrong, but that's my suspicion.

Karl, the decel valve tested out okay last time I checked. I'll check it
again.

Thanks all! Joe
