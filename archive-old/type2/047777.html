Hi volks,

&gt; With the engine tuned to the balance between fuel economy and engine
cooling,
&gt; there are many ways to maximize the fuel economy.
&gt; 
&gt; 1.  Tire pressure at 30 PSI front and 40 PSI rear is normal.  If I am on a
trip
&gt; and want maximum economy, I run 55 PSI all around (max rating on my load
range C
&gt; tires).  This decreases rolling resistance.  You can test this by pushing
the
&gt; bus at the lower and higher pressures, and feeling the difference.
&gt; ... 
	&lt;more tips follow&gt;

 Am I the only one who thinks this is a bad idea?

 Overinflating the tyres will cause the bus to ride on the centre of the
tread. This
will cause increased wear (_at_centre) and also decrease grip. Braking
distances will be 
substantially higher, I think, because there will be less rubber on the
road.

 If you overinflate the front tyres the steering gets very light- this is
because
there is less resistance to turning the tyres on the road. This is not what
you 
want in an emergency, when those little patches of rubber are all that's
between
you, your kids and an appointment with St. Peter.

 I am oversimplifying a little- for example the shape of the contact patch 
changes, and the pressure under the smaller patch of rubber increases, but
you
are still asking a smaller bit of rubber to do the same job: when push comes

to shove it will be less capable.

Cheers,
	  W.
