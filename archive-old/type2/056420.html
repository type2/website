Subject: incomplete '80 Westi maybe for sale

I'm in the process of taking parts off my '80 westi to get my new '82 into
shape for use.  When I get through, the '80 will have bad front rotors, a
bad speedometer, extractor exhaust w/o converter, weber carbs, no curtains
and miscellaneous similar defects.  There is still a lot of car there. The
engine runs great but has a serious oil leak, probably around the fuel pump.
The body has some rust and dents but is repairable.  It has decent tires.
As time goes by I,ll be taking more and more parts off of it.  If there is
any interest in it, I'd like to hear about it.  I hate to part it out but I
also hate to see all those parts go away.  I may keep the engine and
tranny..Still thinking it over.
