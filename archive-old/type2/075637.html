Subject: Re: [T2] Carb Question

Hi Bob and all,
    I agree with your idea of installing fi (fuel injection) back on the 76.  While installing the fi system use one from a 79 - 83
type 2 California system t2 or t3 (bus or van) .  These systems have many advantages/ advances.

(1976) 3/4 grind cam. I am going to purchase new carbeuration and would like to know preferences. My choices are Weber 34 ICT's,
Weber 40 IDF or some type of single carb. I'm open to suggestions. My goals are reliability, reasonable perfomamce and mpg. Thanks
