Subject: Re: [T2] Tool I'd like to see...

Don asked:

What I'd like to see is a feeler gauge that has a cast pot metal body with
fingers going around the .006 feeler part so they form a pocket. The
body/fingers would be bent at a comfortable angle to get in our rockers
without having to put our human fingers into the contortions that they
currently suffer. Maybe 60* or something.

Here is a crappy pic: http://www.samstagsales_dot_com/mercedes/mb617589004001.jpg
of what Mercedes uses for feeler gauges. It is red plastic and comes with 4 screws and nuts. You put one
feeler on each end, The feelers are 90mm long and 12mm wide with 2 holes in them to sit in the handle. The
feelers are in mm size, from .10 to .40 in .05mm increments.
