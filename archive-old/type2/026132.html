Mike,

Are you sure you don't have a notch?  It's little more than a scratch
anyway.  Either way, use the rotor arm as a guide to check whether you're in
the ball park (ie which plug wire would it be nearest to if the cap was on,
that's the plug that's firing).  Get a more accurate idea of the right
position from the relationship between the pulley and the case (as in when
you check your timing).
This is all assuming that you either have the plug wires connected or you
know where they go to on the dizzy cap.
