Hello all
	Many thanks to all that responded to my last post about my ill bus.  I
finally had some time today to try to do some work on it.  I just put in
a new fuel filter (the old one was quite dirty with sludge). I also
adjusted the valves...i had a couple that needed some adjusting (mainly
#4). Then i got into the bus to start it up and still no go.  I then
decided to toss in a shot of gas into the carb. to see if i can get even
a rumble from the engine...but still no go. My next step tomorrow is to
try to adjust the points. Any suggestions/comments on this, or where to
go from here will be gladly taken.  Also this is my first attempt at
setting the points (i'll try the feeler guage method first, then goto
the tach/dwell method later) so if there is any words of wisdom i'll
appreciate it.

Thanks all in advance....


later
