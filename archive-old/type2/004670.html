We just took our bus on it's first trip this past weekend.  All went fairly well except for an oil leak which we have not yet found.  And, something on the sliding door fell off (broken in at least two peices) and the door then would not close all the way,  has to kind of wrestle it and finally got it shut.  Will not open it again til we can find the part, that is after we find out what part it is.  Does any one have any ideas on this, and , if the oil is overfilled slightly, will it leak?  It blows oil all over the back hatch and glass.  Also, the little latch piece that holds the engine compartment open is needed.

Thanks, Gail
