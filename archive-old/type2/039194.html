Subject: Top end rebuild

Hi.

My '78 is in for a major oil leak.  I expect it will be the rear oil seal.

This being the case, I expect that the engine will be pulled.

I have experienced severe blow-by in the past year or so.  My compression is 
about 105 - 110 all around.

The engine is 140,000,, and has not been rebuilt.  It is a smooth running 
engine, with adequate power (provided it is tuned)

Question #1:  As long as the engine is being pulled, should rebuild both 
heads, and simply replace the rings??  My mechanic could probably replace 
the heads and the rings in an hour and half.

Question #2:  I have some heads from a '77 AUTOMATIC bus that could be 
rebuilt.  That way, it would be one movement.  These heads have never been 
rebuilt, either.  Will the '77 Automatic heads fit my '78 stick??  I. e., is 
there some difference between heads from an automatic bus than from a 
standard bus, and any difference in the heads between '77 (mechanical 
lifters) and '78 (hydraulic lifters)??

Question #3:  Anything else I should look out for??

Thanks.
