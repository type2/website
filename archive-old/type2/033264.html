Jaime,

I like the 12--&gt;6 volt idea a lot - if, in fact it would turn the spring all
the way. Does anybody have enough electrical know-how to determine this?

Also, I thought of the CCW turn after the butterfly was removed.

Anybody else have pearls of wisdom?

&gt;  Well, seems to me, if you're already running too
&gt;  rich,
&gt;  this would only make matters worse.
&gt;
&gt;  Ok....so here's a really &quot;out-there&quot; idea....how
&gt;  about
&gt;  putting a voltage-drop (12v-6v) on the electric
&gt;  lead?
&gt;  In *theory*, being at half the voltage, it *should*
&gt;  take *twice* as long to open the coil.
