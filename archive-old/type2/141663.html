Subject: Re: [T2] Lead Paint Test results - 71 bus

Wasn't the lead additive (home and industrial paint products) for easy 
application, i.e. brushes on smoother.

For the last 40 years an Alkyd Enamel (petroleum based) top coat was the 
most popular with OEM's

Wear a respirator and your ok, Beware of paint striper, there is no approved 
respirator for this horrible stuff. In-line max air flow and a body suite. 
That stuff burns the skin on contact. Ouch.

&gt;I got a lead paint test kit from Ace hardware and attempted to test the 
&gt;paint on my 71 bus.  The paint looks to be original with a white top and 
&gt;read bottom.  The white tested clean.  The problem I ran into with the red 
&gt;is that the test I used has red/pink as the indicator and the red paint 
&gt;rubbed off onto the test kit so there is no way to get a good read with 
&gt;that test kit.  Good to know that 71 white is lead free.  I will follow up 
&gt;when/if I get the red tested in another fashion.
