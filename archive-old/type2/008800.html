Subject: Pushrod seals - all or just the leaker? 2.0 FI

I've got a leaker - should I do all the seals or just the guilty party.  1
of the 2 number 2 head side has sprung - 1, 3 and 4 are bone dry both on the
head and engine sides.

First time procedure for me - the archives and Sean Bartnik's FAQ were
helpful in the actual procedure but not in noting if I should do them all
now - or pay later.   Is this one of those maintenance issues that I shoulda
woulda coulda done it right the first time by doing them all?

James Bond ain't got nothing on me - smoke screen and oil slick on!

Thanks
