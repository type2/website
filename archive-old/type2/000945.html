 Hi Listees,
How do you fel about EGR Valves?
Do you secretly disable them because they make your engine run rough?
I did this in my last car, and now I'm thinking of doing it again, even
though it's illegal. I suspect I'm not the only person who does this, as
someone at work yesterday said &quot;jam a ball bearing in the tube&quot; When I said
&quot;EGR&quot;.
