&gt;  Has any one got any info on either of the above linings?

I'm not sure of their construction, but Rabbits came out with &quot;life 
time&quot; brake pads. It was common, I'm told, to go 100K on these pads. 
I've replaced a couple sets, along w/ new rotors. The guy at the parts 
counter said the rotors often wear out before the pads.

Non-VW: This summer, at 82K, I replaced the rear shoes on my 89 Hyndai, 
and only because I sprang a leak in the wheel cylinder. The front pads 
are at 50% wear. The drums and rotors show almost no wear, but I turned 
the drums anyway... because there's no adjustment slot for the rear 
shoes. 

It's my experience that by the time &quot;standard&quot; shoes wear out, the 
hydraulics are ready to blow.
