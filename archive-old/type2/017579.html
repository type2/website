&gt; Greetings all,
&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;    So now I have the right motor and I also have my work cut out.  This thing
&gt; looks more like a real motor compared to my 1600DP.  I see a lot of things that
&gt; are strange to me and I'll have plenty of questions.
&gt;         The first question is, if these are 1700cc heads, will 1800cc cylinders fit on
&gt; the motor without machining?
Randall:
No, you'll have to machine the heads to get 1800 cylinders to fit. The
good news is, machining the headgasket sealing area is a real good idea
anyway. Find a machine shop that you're comfortable with, this is a
procedure that's unlike those done on American cars and not all shops
have expertise in this area.
The other good thing you can do is use 96mm big bore pistons and
cylinders (if you can find them). A 96mmX66mm engine will make 1909cc.
and while it won't give you any more horsepower, it WILL give you more
torque at a given speed and be easier to drive and peppier through the
gears.
You'll have to pay good attention to the compression ratio and make sure
you don't go over 7.5 or so.(A little lower if you plan on driving in
Mexico or further south). This means measuring the deck height, cc'ning
the heads, and calculating the required cylinder base shims.(Look in the
archives first).
Regarding the repair of heat exchangers: It's definitely doable to
repair the outside sheet metal. Bus Depot recently had new German ones
on sale at $120 each, though, which is pretty reasonable.
