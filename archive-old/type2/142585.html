&gt;So the P.O. Took off my cooling system obviously, because I can't find
&gt;anything but the flaps left on it. I need to know what parts it's going to
&gt;take to set up my cooling system properly. I assume I will need a thermo
&gt;bracket, pulley, and whatever else it takes to mount these.

&gt;I have a new
&gt;Type1 thermostat and cable and the spring mounted flaps, which like Don's
&gt;aren't particularly keen on springing back wide open, they stick. An
&gt;exploded diagram would be helpful in my figuring this out. Anyone seen a
&gt;good one online?

Is this why I don't have any heat in the Westy? It never
&gt;gets to operating temp?

Find the leaks and seal them up:
