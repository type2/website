Charlie,

I just wrote and posted a whole procedure on how to get a non-running
engine running, and NOW I CAN'T FIND IT!!! DRAT!!!!

OK, well, you have an ignition problem it sounds like.  First, get under
the bus, pull the right side valve cover and rotate the engine until the
valves say you are at TDC for #1 Rotate the engine clockwise until the #1
intake valve opens and closes, then another 180 degrees.  Look on the
fan/pulley to see if the timing mark is near to TDC. If it isn't, move it
to 0 TDC.  Pop the cap off your dist, note where the rotor points.  It
*should* be pointing at the tower on the cap that has the wire to #1 spark
plug.  does it? If so, go *counterclockwise* and make sure that the other
towers bear wires going to cylinders 2-3-4 in that order.

Now that we know the spark plug wires are in the correct order, get out
your dwell meter and connect it.  Crank the engine.  The reading will be
jumpy at that low RPM, but should be *close* to 50 (40-60 is OK here).
After making sure that the points are opening and closing somewhere near
where they ought to be, return the crank and rotor to #1 TDC. (bump it or
crank it with a socket) Set the timing staticall by rotating the engine
thru the 7.5 BTDC position.  Your dwell meter ought to jump from 0 to 90
as you pass the 7.5 mark on the scale.

Things to look for otherwise:  are all the wires connected? the wire to
the coil, the wire to the points?  unplug and replug these, just in case
(not that this has ever happened to me :-)  Also look at the position of
your coil.  If it is loose in its clamp, it can rotate and bring the
terminals to the point where they short against the fan shroud.
