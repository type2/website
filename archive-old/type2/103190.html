Subject: RE: [T2] Heater and Defroster Knobs

I believe I started that discussion when mine broke. I got a great set from
Karl (Thanks Karl!) here on the list.

Also Ken Madson at www.thebusco_dot_com had a set. You may want to email him to
see if he has more.

Subject: [T2] Heater and Defroster Knobs


A couple of weeks ago I saw a source for replacement red and green
Heater and Defroster Knobs on the forum, but I emptied the trash before
I saved the information. Anyone still have that info handy?
