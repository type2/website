Subject: shift linkage

When I bought my '69 transporter (in 1983), I had trouble getting into second
gear.  I drove it this way until a mechanic friend suggested that it might be
easy to fix.  I did two things: 1) lubricated all the points in the linkage
where it goes through frame members and  2) Loosened the base plate of the shift
lever and wiggled it into a new position and retightened.  This latter I did a
couple of times until it worked just fine.  John Jensen in Annapolis.
