Subject: Re: Wacky Idea (temp. sensor modification)

Disclaimer:  my own understanding of all this is a little lacking also, but
I suppose discussion is good for building understanding, or something...

&gt; Carbs cannot adjust for altitude and will therefore run richer as elevation
&gt; increases.  

I know that there are a few carbs with altitude compensation mechanisms on
them, mostly in &quot;High Altitude&quot; vehicles.  I don't know if VW ever did
anything like this with their carbs, though.

&gt; L-Jet fuel injection has a mass-air meter which accurately measures the
&gt; amount of air going into the engine regardless of the elevation.  This
&gt; system will not run rich at high altitude like the previous two.

It won't?  My understanding of this is that the L-Jet AFM measures both air
volume and air temperature, but it doesn't measure pressure, and therefore
can't compensate for altitude.  I might be misunderstanding the function of
the flap in the AFM, though.  '79 California injection, with the O2 (lambda)
sensor could possibly correct the mixture at high altitude, at least
somewhat...

Still, that D. Turner guy with the nifty L-Jet modification site concurs:

(click the &quot;L-Jet vs. World&quot; link).

That said, Stephen had it right, I think: AFM measures the air, assuming
sea-level atmospheric pressure of, say, 15psi and dispenses fuel
accordingly.  Mountain air being (for example) 13psi, however, there's not
enough O2 for that much fuel, and the engine runs rich.  Ya.

Anyway, a system such as this could be used to lean the mixture, too.  I
just had it backwards...

I don't know enough about D-Jet to compare it.  I'll have to read a bit on
that one (it was on the type3?)
