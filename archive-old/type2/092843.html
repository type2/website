Download a copy of EKTA. It;s out there.

You can do the same thing as the parts desk.

There is a certain online auction place where some Canadian is selling 
copies for $10. Dunno why he hasn't been busted though.

There is also a Russian site that hosts an on-line copy of EKTA. The site 
is in Russian. The part numbers and diagrams are in English.

&gt;I also use the local VW parts store to get numbers.  I have access to 
&gt;commercial desk and he knows i am only looking for the part number in his 
&gt;system.  According to VW about 50 percent of the inventory of busdepot, 
&gt;aircooled_dot_net, gowesty, RMMW, etc..... is NLA.  When the aftermarket 
&gt;suppliers say NLA then it is probably NLA in normal retail and head for 
&gt;the salvage specialist or start asking  lists like this one.
