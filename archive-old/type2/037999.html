A while back, somebody recommended Outwater Plastics as a source for
hard-to-find extrusions (I *love* that word!). I ordered their catalog
from their web site (www.outwater_dot_com) and it looks like they've got
just about everything..

I figured it might come in handy when I get around to replacing some of
the paneling (and trim) in my Adventurewagen.

Hope this helps,

Nikki
