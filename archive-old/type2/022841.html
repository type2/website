As an admirer of the transporters, I am very impressed with this
&quot;find&quot; that I helped the local bug shop acquire.
1959 Deluxe Transporter that is completely original.  Runs good.  This
one has a 1200cc engine.  There is very little rust.  The paint is
faded original and is almost red and white.  It has the center seat
and all of the &quot;jail bars&quot;.  It has 63,000 miles.  It is a ONE OWNER
bus that was used as a TV repair van and a Civil Defense transport.
This bus drives good, but the brakes are almost non-existant and the
muffler has a hole in it.  It does still have the original Civil
Defense first aid kit that is unused, but all of the packages expired
in 1963.  
Come see this bus at the Smokey Mountain Bug Fest in Gatlinburg, TN on
August 24 and August 25.  It will be in the sale area.

$3500.
