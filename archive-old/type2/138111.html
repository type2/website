Subject: Re: [T2] ACCUFIRE electronic ignition

Hello Guys  I personaly prefer the crane units XR700  Cost more but the 
failure rate is a lot lower than the others. I one unit that has been in a bug for 
over 17 years and havent touched it,  I have seen the pertrnix not work right 
out of the box.  Only Crane unit I seen go bad was caused by a tach shorting 
out   later and have fun  Mark Dearing
