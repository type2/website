&gt;recently the sliding door ceased to &quot;pop&quot; open - i now have to put my

Lubing the parts is easy. I still find adjusting the door difficult.

Are you sure this isn't a winter problem with the seal sticking to the door? I seem to have sliding door issues every winter but I don't think it's 100% adjusted right. On my wife's car I usually give the door a little push before I try to pull it to avoid the handle slipping out of my hand from the tight seal I'm not expecting.
