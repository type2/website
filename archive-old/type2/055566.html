Subject: Re: Westy tent sealing &amp; prices at Puyallup

All Hail Mighty Listees,

Having read many threads about original Westy tents concerning
water-proofing and tent prices lately, I felt the need to respond....

First....concerning water-proofing, PLEASE don't risk your tent by
using ANY &quot;water-proofing&quot; material without testing it first on some
other canvas. As an avid skier/snowboarder, my experience has been
that many of these &quot;color safe&quot; products tend to run the colors!!! 

Please remember that you are dealing with an ANTIQUE here!!! If you
live in a mostly wet climate, buy yourself a cheap free-standing tent
and use the &quot;safe&quot; 
water-proof at will!

Second...Another listee mentioned finding a Westy tent for sale at the
Puyallup show going for $600.00. That seems WAY steep to me and I just
bought one, so my research into the matter is fairly recent($500.00
seemed to be the high-end).

Another listee mentioned using a combination of kerosene and parrafin
wax to seal a tent. I would sooner use this concoction on my
nether-regions than my prized tent!!!

PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, think about it before you do something
permanent (which the kerosene/parrafin most DEFINATELY IS)to such a
collectible item!

If you really are worried, go buy yourself a $10.00 blue tarp, some
cheap nylon twine and some extra stakes. With the above (as well as
digging a trench around your tent), you can make a rain fly that would
keep a Kennedy dry;-).

Unless you really want to ruin yet another Westy tent and make that
$600.00+ price tag a reality sooner than need be for the rest of us!

BTW: the paraffin/kerosene combo does work; just look at any Army
surplus tent. Then again, would YOU pay $600.00 for a surplus tent,
much less attach one to your bus?! I think not.


Sorry to be so testy about the Westy,
