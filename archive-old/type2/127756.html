Subject: Re: [T2] Rotor Button? Distributor Cap?

&gt; Hmm, I think there's a law that states: no tool box should exceed the
&gt; size of the vehicle the tools stored therein are kept for working on.
&gt; Except that the law doesn't end with a preposition.

no doubt. does that thing have a trailer hitch on the end?
