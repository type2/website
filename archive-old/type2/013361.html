Howdy. I'm sending this out today instead of Friday since it's today's 
(Thursday) paper. The Raleigh, NC, based News and Observer asked for 
submissions a while back about peoples' first cars. I sent in a lovely 
essay about my first bus, and they ran it today! So, if you're in the 
area, check out the paper. It's on the front page of the Auto section. 
You can try www.newsobserver_dot_com but I can't seem to find it on there 
anywhere.
As a side note, they put in a picture of my double cab instead of my bus.
Anyway, finally something worth reading about in the paper.
:)
Happy Thursday
