&gt; 1) For optimal engine life.. on a VDO cyl head temperature guage, what is
&gt; the normal operating temperature at the #3 cyl?

this is one of those who knows kinda questions. For every suggestion I
have heard there has been an example where said engine dies early. My
new 1600 DP engine seems to be normal in the 325-375 range. 

&gt; 2) If I have a cyl head temperature guage, should I still have an oil
&gt; temperature guage?

I'd say so. Might as well put a oil pressure gauge there as well. 

&gt; 3) What is the easiest way to make SURE that my &quot;Generator&quot; light is really
&gt; working? My Bus hasn't run out of power, but how do I know that it won't?

&gt; 5) Is the speedometer in my Bus the same speedometer they installed in the
&gt; early 70s Porsches? They look a heck of a lot alike?

I don't think so, unless Porsches topped out at 80 :)
 
&gt; 6) How can I convince my fiancee that 401K retirement accounts are
&gt; important, and that we should be saving and not buying tons and tons of new
&gt; furniture.

Well, as a bus owner, we don't really have the worlds best leverage
when it comes to doing the practical thing :)
