Hey y'all
I was up at the local 'secret VW place' and John showed me a vanagon with 
new motor, auto tranny.  Walkthrough, empty cargo area.  $2000.

Looked like a good deal to me.  Body was in good shape too.  His # (Roberts 
VW in Lenoir NC) (828)754-4914

Tell him the bus guy sent you (then duck! ;-)  Seriously he's a good guy to 
deal with.

Mad Uncle Dave
