&gt; have yet to have a failure out of the box of any OEM part. I won't say 
&gt; it's impossible, it just cuts the risk to the bone. And remember, I 
&gt; probably put more hours servicing Bosch systems every week than most 
&gt; DIY'ers do every year.

Hello Tim and all   I also do a lot of Bosch systems and prefer Bosch over 
other brands but I have seen them fail right out of the box. I had a brand new 
electric fuel pump that didn't turn one time, also remember all of those bad 01 
011 points that were floating around about 2 years ago.I switched to 01 030 
which are a lot better points. Of course they won't play you when their stuff 
fails just replace with another so you are out of your time. But all in all the 
Bosch stuff is a lot better than the others,.   Later and have fun  Mark
