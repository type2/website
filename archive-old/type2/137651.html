Subject: Re: [T2] Dual Kadrons, Breather and Charcoal Can ?

Hey, I was wondering about this part of your message too. I've taken
our new 73 Westie on some trial runs and found it rather gutless. At
first I was wondering if this was because it has a 1700 whereas our
faster feeling 72 bus has a 2 liter.

But seeing you are experiencing power from a 1700, I wonder how much
more power we would experience by changing carbs. I figure part of the
sluggishness is the weight of the camper gear in the westy compared to
our empty bus.

John

         So I've got my new Kadrons installed on my '73 1700, balance line
 tapped for brake booster,  linkage all figured out and I have them
 tuned/balanced nicely as well. She runs REALLY nicely. Temps are nice
 an low, she idles smooth, accelerates smoothly  and powerfully as well.
