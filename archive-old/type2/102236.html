Subject: Re: [T2] AVP longblock Rebuild: Head failure_at_ 15K Miles

Robert,

I have two AVP heads on my '79 bus.  The first went on like a dream and 
runs the same - it is the 3 and 4 cylinders.  The head had crack in it 
when I got it off.

Six months later the number 1 and 2 head went.    The head had a bad 
valve.  The &quot;new&quot; from AVP was big pain in the butt.  My mechanic tried 
to put it on but the shims and other stuff didn't match up.  

I called AVP and talked to Erin.  She was very nice and understanding. 
 She explained that some mechanics can put more shims in, or something 
like that, but since my mechanic didn't want to no problem.  Told me to 
ship the head back and she would send out a replacement.  She sent out 
the replacement BEFORE she got the non matching head back - pretty nice?

The replacement head arrive and fit like a dream and runs the same.  

Long and short of it is that AVP makes a head that sometimes doesn't fit 
or work.  BUT they have, in my experience, been extremely willing to 
correct any issue that arose.
