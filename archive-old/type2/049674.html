Subject: [T2] Sighting - Split window!

Hello,

On TV last night was an ad for AT&amp;T wireless, or some sort of digital phone 
company thing...

There was this shepard with his sheep and he was calling and staying in 
touch with all of his family apparently, and in one of the scenes in this 
green ( I believe) and white split window Bus on the rolling green hills 
with a few people standing beside it.... it was really nice looking - and 
then gone after about a fes seconds...

Happy trails....

Chris, Kell, and Tre'
