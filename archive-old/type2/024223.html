Greetings Listerinos!

I have read in countless articles that early Baywindow Busses were 
chronically underpowered.  Perhaps you've seen the same sort of drivel.  
After I did some tinkering on my 70 I'll have you all know that I blew a 
Goodwill truck off the road.  Passed him like he was standing still.  And 
that's not all.............  I also passed a streetsweeper.  But he had one 
of those reflective triangle gizmos hanging on the back of his rig so I 
didn't really count him.
This major performance improvement is due to that nifty little SVDA 
distributor John C. is selling over at aircooled_dot_net  The dual advance (DA) 
part of this number really sets nicely with the old 1600.  Nice power 
throughout the whole range of acceleration.  Amazing because this dizzy 
appears to be nothing more than a 009 with a vacuum advance.  Geez, good 
things do come in small packages!  
Next weekend I'll have enough time to tune it completely (I just &quot;ear-timed&quot; 
this weekend).  The weekend after that I'm going to install the electronic 
ignition.  You can tell I like to do one step at a time.  The weekend after 
that I think I'll go for the CDI.
Then I'm taking the Bus out against Mrs. Hofstatter (the retired lady down 
the street) and her 63 Studebaker.  She better get used to the sight of my 
taillights!
