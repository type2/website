&gt;Hi all,
&gt;    I'm getting ready to put together a 79, 2liter, engine.  While
&gt;inspecting the connecting rods I didn't see the raised marks on the
&gt;shanks,that should be on the top side.  Tom Wilson, in a photo caption on
&gt;page 44 of his book, says that type 4 rods do not have these bumps.  I'm
&gt;confused because the Bentley manual doesn't say anything about the type 4
&gt;rods being exempt from having these marks.
&gt;    I've searched the archives but can't find the info I need, so I'm asking
&gt;all of you.  Must there be a raised mark on my connecting rods to indicate
&gt;the top, or can they go in either way ?

There will be no mark on 1700, 1800 or 2-liter rods, and If you look on
page 118 of Wilson, it mentions that you should &quot;orient the rods so the
bearing tangs are at the bottom of the journals when the crank is
horizontal&quot;.  This implies (and I'm pretty sure it's true) that the type IV
rods can go in either way.  Back on pg. 44 Wilson mentions &quot;offset small
ends&quot; on type 1 rods but not type IV rods, which seems to back this up.
