Subject: Re: [T2] Pop top cot

[...]

&gt;    I was wondering anyone know how much weight a 72' pop top cot can hold
safely. Are we talking an adult or just a small kid?


73 is the same as 72 and back. I am talking about the canvas, not the frame.
[No, you cannot swap the canvas between them, but the material is the same]
Here is page 18 of the 73 owners manual:
http://www.geocities_dot_com/thegreatjose/VW/73westypage18.JPG

Top left corner, it says: 'an additional cot for a child'.
Bottom right corner, it says: 'The child using the canvas cot should weigh no
more than 150 lbs.'

I think the key here is the weight max: 150 lbs.
