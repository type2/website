&gt; How do I clean my spray gun  after using it.

Here's what I do. Others may do things differently, but this works for
me when I don't forget about the gun and let the paint dry...

You need:

Mineral Spirits (or other solvent depending on what you were spraying)
Pipe Cleaners
Big metal coffee can
Gloves (Unless you LIKE the feeling of solvent on your skin!)
Toothbrushes

Spray mineral spirits through the gun into the coffee can until it
comes out clear. Disassemble gun and put brass parts in can with the
MS you sprayed out of the gun. Using fresh MS and pipe cleaners, clean
all air and paint passages. Toothbrush comes in handy here for larger
areas and outside surfaces.  Wipe with clean rag.

Clean all the metal parts first with the MS in the can, then rinse
with clean MS. Use pipe cleaners and toothbrush as necessary. Wipe
with clean rag.

Let the parts dry completely before assembling.

DO NOT USE WATER!!!!
