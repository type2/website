Subject: generator problem

Volks,

I am a bit stale on type1 engines, as it has been a number of years since
I worked on one regularly and I have runb into a bit of a problem... When
I was over at Pat Flynn's place working on his over the weekend we had
some wierd symptoms. I cranked the engine and we got a regular click, as
if of an electrical arc, coming from the generator.  The bus did start
eventually but ran badly for 2-3 seconds then backfired and died.  His
(new)  battery also keeps going flat on him.  I am quite mystified at all
this, frankly and all I can think of is that the generator may have become
&quot;depolarized&quot; or is otherwise FUBAR.  Any opinions?

                           Steve Dolan
