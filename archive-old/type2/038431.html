for sure, read twice pull once (to paraphras an old saying)
&gt; 
&gt; SUPPORT THE TRANS at the bellhousing end..... otherwise when you pull
&gt; the engine, the trans will drop and you will trash your CV joints.

????? the type IV engines all have a tranny yoke and two big bolts at the
bell housing end. (check to make sure the bolts are actually there)

but I usuually put a chain fall under the tranny mounted on the yoke when
I pull my engine.. less under the vehicle but the tranny is still
supported
