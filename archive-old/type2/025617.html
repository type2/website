&gt; I ski and fought this problem for years, finally broke down and put in a
&gt; gas fired aux heater, lots of work but lots of heat.  (I was driving in
&gt; Vermont at 12 degrees in a light jacket and the window cracked last year)

Bob,

The &quot;lots of heat&quot; has me wanting to do the &quot;lots of work&quot;.

Would you please fill me in on the &quot;gas-fired aux heater&quot; details.

Thanks in advance for whatever help you or anyone else might send my way.

PS  I may live in Houston, but my parents live in Nebraska, and I'd like to
have a comfortable ride home for Christmas.
