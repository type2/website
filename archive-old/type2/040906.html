I drew up the design I used for my engine dolly last year, then offered it
on the list to anyone interested.  I have a 1600 DP, but the plans could be
easily modified for most any of the aircooled engines.

Looks like I'm accumulating another list of mail-ees.  If anyone is
interested, I'll mail them a paper copy of the plan (it's on a single piece
of 11 x 17 paper, done on cadd and easily read).  Also makes a good stool
once the engine is back in.

&gt;John,
&gt;
&gt;What this about an engine dolly?  Is it for type I engines or any air
cooled?
&gt;Info would be appreciated!
