No.  Generally, VW manufactured a &quot;California&quot; version for the stricter 
California emissions requirements and a &quot;Federal&quot; model for the other 49 
states and Canada.  However, Canada was generally less strict than the 
US, so there are also &quot;Canada-only&quot; variations of the &quot;Federal&quot; model.

So, California stuff was the first to have FI instead of carbs, 
hall-effect distributors instead of points, O2 sensors in the FI system, 
catalytic converters, etc.

&gt; I have a new engine (so I don't know if the engine code matters) with the
&gt; original exhaust (I assume) from a federal model(model plate in driver door
&gt; says federal).  I have the crossover pipe going to a &quot;U&quot; shaped pipe on left
&gt; (with connection to EGR filter) then into Cat, then to muffler.

Looking at my diagram for air cooled Vanagons, this is what is identified 
as the &quot;49 states and Canada&quot; version, though Canadian versions had no 
catalytic converter nor EGR.
 
&gt; I was told that the federal model required more stringant emission controls
&gt; (from inspector).  The tech at RMMW stated that the fed version was made for
&gt; the strict CA emission controls, hence the cat converter.  They both stated
&gt; that the other model &quot;other 48 states/canada&quot; had looser restrictions.

No.  Speaking only of the air-cooled Vanagons, the California model had 
the most stringent emission controls.  The &quot;Federal&quot; model also had a 
catalytic converter, in a differnt configuration than the California 
model.  The Federal model had no O2 sensor, while the California model 
had one.  It was the Canadian model the didn't have the catalytic converter.

&gt; 
&gt; I have no authoritative information on this issue.  I would really
&gt; appreciate some clarification.  Anyone on the list have more definate info?
