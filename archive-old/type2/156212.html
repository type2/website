Subject: Temperature in Heater Tube

I am working on my Heater Tube under the center of my '72 Bus.  Does anyone know how hot the air gets that runs thru this tube?  The reason I want to know is that I may use POR-15 to preserve the inside of the tube before I install it.  I have written the POR-15 company to ask about out gassing and the temperature limits of their product.
