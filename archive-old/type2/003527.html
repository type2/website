Hi folks, Mr Bill with a first time post.

Just did my first engine removal today to replace a suspected wet clutch
disc. Sure enough, the plate was a mess with obvious leakage from the trans
seal. My question is: behind the seal, an inner sleeve with an oil tunnel is
mentioned in my manual and it is recommended that it be replaced along with
the seal. I don't think the inner sleeve is there!

I can only try to visualize the critter from the way it is described in the
book,  when looking along the input shaft the view is of a recessed metal
piece which centers the shaft in the housing. the gap around the shaft is
about .010&quot;.

Does this sound normal??? I need to button this up for a hot springs trip to
Mammoth,CA. soon, so any help is really appreciated. Thanks,

Mr Bill...  71 hardtop camper
