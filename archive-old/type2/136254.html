Subject: Fwd: [T2] winter handling / driving

&gt; Any tips on driving in the snow with your bus?
&gt; 
     
My '78 has a &quot;posi&quot; rear-end, so it does better in the
snow.  Regardless, when loaded with gear, my bus is
helpless on ice, but surefooted in snow at reasonable
speeds.  Snow covered hills require the chains.
    
If I were you, considering the season, I would plan
your westerly excursion along more southern latitudes
where it is warmer.
