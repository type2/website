&gt; OK, it's been a long time since I've had CV problems.  But I getting

&gt; this would tend to indicate a right-side or left-side CV going bad?

I'd check and retorque your shocks first.

After driving on a little bit of a rough road off of 89a in AZ last week
I started to hear a clunk-clunk that sounded a lot like the
clunk-thud I had in my front end before I replaced the front and rear 
shocks.

Turned out all the bolts had come slightly loose and were under the 
spec'd
torque.

(which reminds me that I have to retorque the front ones this weekend)
