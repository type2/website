Subject: Re: engine conversion

It's a PITA if you don't know anything about them (FI) and can't get them
running on the road (like me). The parts are more expensive and require
diagnostic equipment that I don't currently own. I don't know about the
better gas mileage part. Theoretically, yes.. But the FI efficiency is
traded off then for a bigger engine, pushing more weight, in the case of a
full-Westy. Nicer, more powerful and efficient, yes.. But still, not the
same for an original air-cooled fan, like me. I unapologetically love the
simplicity of the 1600 engine, and I am beginning to see the advantages of
traveling light, rather than having all that kitchen equipment with you,
everywhere you go..  Jan B
