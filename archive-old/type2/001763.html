Maybe the manual could be put up on a web page (any volunteers?). I would
like to see it.

&gt; I now have a copy of the installation brochure and the templates to cut
the
&gt; holes for the BN4 gas heater  in my 1978 Bus. THANKS CASPAR!  I would be
&gt; willing to make copies for US residents if the demand isn't too great. It
&gt; seems that a lot of people who have these heaters have one or two that
&gt; they've used for parts. Please consider selling the needed items:

&gt; Thanks a lot.
