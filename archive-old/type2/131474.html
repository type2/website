&gt;From: &quot;Karl&quot; You have to have the fuse.

To be stock and safe. One PO didn't think so.

&gt;It is a black wire that goes to the + side of the coil and feeds 86c of the 
&gt;relay.

Yep it is there, but it goes straight to the + side of the coil.

&gt;Got a 68-79 Bentley? Look at the 77/78 wiring diagram. Look for 65 66 67 
&gt;along the bottom on the right side.
&gt;You will see the coil pictured. Go straight up to N. See the little 15? See 
&gt;the black
&gt;wire going to the right? See it go to S21? THAT is the in-line fuse for the 
&gt;backup lights. From there
&gt;the black wire goes up and to the right and ends at the double relay.

I see it but when I look at the bus I don't. I really need to crawl under 
there and see where the backup light switch is and see if there is something 
connected.

&gt;If all that wiring is missing, then you need to reinstall it. Find 86c on 
&gt;the double relay and see what is in
&gt;the wire plastic block. It is probably cut off. Here is the plug 
&gt;arrangement:
&gt;http://www.conservatory_dot_com/vw/manuals_nyx/Images/FeulInjection/L-Jetronic/LJET-18.GIF
&gt;Section b has 86c in it.

Previous...it is there and straight to the coil.

&gt;Test, test, test...... it has to be there.

Yes I will do it. But if it is wired this way it(double relay) should still 
work right?

Thanks,
