Subject: Snow handling of 412

Alright, Jens, and others in the snowy east who have had their 412s out
in the snow before... generally, how do they do in the snow? I have
new-ish All Season M/S tires with chunky deep tread, 21 psi front, 28
psi rear. Do they oversteer like a 911? 

I also have about 150 lbs forward of the spare tire to keep the front
end tracking. I have access to another 300 lbs (Jerry jugs of water) if
that is helpful. Any other ideas? 

I'll need to get to 495 &amp; Baltimore ASAP (Tuesday?) and that will mean
trekking over a couple miles of semi-plowed DC streets. This San
Diego-born, NC hometown boy should have taken the train home on Friday. 

From UNBELIEVABLY SNOWY DC,
