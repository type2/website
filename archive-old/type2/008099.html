Weekend project:  Go through the brakes.  They'd been pulling a bit
lately, so it might be a good time to inspect things.  I also hadn't
looked at the front pads in a while, so I had visions of them being a
gnat's eyelash from metal-to-metal contact.

Saturday noon, the Santa Ana winds are blowing, so it's nice and warm
here in SoCal.  You know, the kind of weather that everyone sees
during telecasts of the Rose Parade that prompts another million or so
to move to LA.  Nice to work on brakes while I can feel my fingers!

I'd already bought a set of Bendix brake pads at the local brake
house, since I was so sure that I would need to replace them.  No
problem, jack the front of the bus and pop the wheels off.  Oddly
enough, the pads have lots of material left, so that end of the job is
easy.

Wife comes out and says that she wants to &quot;go do some shopping&quot;.  No
problem, so she takes the bug and off she goes.  

I get out the grease gun and shoot some grease into the front end. 
Sure wish I had grease fittings on the ball joints!

Lower the front end, raise the rear.  Pull the left rear drum (love
those composite drums!)  Front shoe (the &quot;leading&quot; shoe that does most
of the braking) is down to paper-thickness.  Caught this one just in
time!  Go to pull the shoes off.  Bentley says to remove the retainers
and then the springs.  Retainers come off easily, and the weak lower
spring, but there's no way that the upper spring is coming off with
the shoes installed.  The spring is behind the shoes and the ends
aren't made to slip in and out easily.  I disconnect the e-brake cable
and twiddle around with the shoes and finally use the brute force
technique, pulling the shoes against spring tension and then straight
out.  This works, but there has to be a better way!

By now, 3:00 rolls around.  The brake house closes at four and Marie
is still gone on her shopping expedition.  She must be doing well, as
she has been gone for three hours.  Normally, Marie and I have the
same philosophy about shopping: more than a half-hour is too much! 
Unfortunately, she also has the other car, and the only way that I am
going to get parts.  If I don't get to the brake house by 4, the bus
is going to be up on stands for a week!  I gnash my teeth and pace
back and forth for a while.  Daughter senses my distress and tries to
comfort me.  5-year-olds are very empathic and are nice to have around.

Marie shows up at 3:45 with a bug full of packages.  I throw her out
of the car and zip off to the brake house.  The fellow has the parts I
need and I get out of there with 5 minutes to spare &lt;whew&gt;.

Get home and install new shoes on left side.  Hole for e-brake arm is
a tad undersize, but a touch with the Dremel allows the pivot to drop
into place.  Remove adjusters, clean, and lube with anti-sieze on the
threads and barrels.  Drop 'em back in and finish installing the shoes.

Start on the right drum.  It's stubborn coming off of the hub, but I
finally break it loose and pull it off.  I need to pull them more often!
These shoes look better than the other side &lt;whew&gt;.  This side is a
lot easier to do, as I am already in practice.  Only mistake I made
was installing the e-brake arm backwards.

Reinstall the drum and wheel.  Go up front and loosen the e-brake
cables.  Adjust the shoes a bit, but they are really hard to adjust
when new.  Drive the bus a few miles to get the shoes seated a bit
better.  Now they adjust better.  Finally adjusted the e-brake so that
the wheels can just be turned by hand with the handle out 6 clicks. 
No problem there.

Final result is markedly better braking with a much more solid pedal. 
E-brake works much better as well.  I can't wait until they get bedded
in better!
