Hi Volks,

&gt; Most all cars had different door handles between 68 and 69. Doors in
&gt; USA imports starting in 70 had some additional strengthening for side
&gt; impact intrusion protection. I've heard of grey- market cars having to
&gt; have these installed. 

Are you talking buses here?  We in Germany got the strengthend doors 
too for the '70 model year.

&gt; Actually I much prefer the 69 up inside locks,
&gt; although the outside triggers seem to freeze in the stuck open
&gt; position in sleet, in my locale (midwest). 

Yeah.  The inside locks above the door openers are great (and BTW, 
they went back to the window pin type for '74!), but the handles tend 
to stick when old and neglected.  (That isn't meant to say your bus 
is neglected; just my experience.  YMMV.)

&gt; So, unless you're a
&gt; stickler for historical perfection, I'd recommend you find a right
&gt; door of 70-73(?) or so vintage to get the additional safety features.

The only actual safety issue I see is that the '69-'73 inside locks 
are harder to open with a wire from the outside.  I honestly don't 
think that the strengthening makes a measurable difference in 
impact protection.  If you're after safety, a '73- would be the 
vehicle of choice... without the Y frame members and the crumple 
element, sturdier doors won't save you in a '68.  Keeping your 
distance will.

And these doors are one of those cool one-year-only parts that make 
the '68 special.  Keep 'em, I say.  Or rather, get a correct driver's 
door for yours.

&gt; As an aside, has anyone else noticed how tinny 68-69 doors sound
&gt; compared to 70 up doors when closing? The ones I've compared had a
&gt; much more solid, quality, sound.

Yeah.  We call 'em the &quot;bang&quot; doors, as opposed to the later &quot;wuff&quot; 
doors, here in Germany.  (Well, the crazies do.)  Sliding doors, BTW, 
are known as the &quot;click&quot; (up to '73) and &quot;kaboom&quot; ('74-'79) variety, 
respectively.  That's descriptive of the most silent way to close 
them.  (Typical sound of a German camping site of the '70s, 4 a.m.?  
Right: &quot;KRRoooooaaaaaaak-kaBOOM!&quot;  :-)

Yours,
    Erik.
