&gt;You should select a supplier that you are pretty sure will be 
&gt;available if
&gt;the battery dies before it runs out of warranty.
===================================&gt;
Also, in the battery area for my 70 busses, the size 24 plastic boxes 
that are sold will also still manage to fit in the battery area.
Those boxes will go a long way towards making the battery support metal 
last a lot longer for you.

Over on the other side, where some put an extra battery,
I find that another size 24 battery box will hold:

3 quarts of 40 W oil
several oil change filters
spare oil change plug and nuts
4 spark plugs
spare belt
spare voltage regulator
spare dizzy
extra set of keys

A stash of things you hope you don't need, but if you do, you have them 
back there behaving themselves, just waiting to be of service.
