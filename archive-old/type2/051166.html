Volks,

This weekend I began to pull the carpet/door panels and such from my 
bus.  I checked out the archives and I'm not so sure I want the solution 
stated (Q-pads.)  This seems like an expensive and permanent 
application.  I guess I'm just not ready to put down something that I can't 
ever get off.

I want something that will deaden sound.  Not too expensive, and is easier 
to apply.  Also, I pulled some insul. from under the carpet.  I will have 
to get rid of it (wear/smell) but I know a better version of it exists with 
a &quot;tar-like&quot; bottom.  It is a gray fibrous material about 1/4&quot; thick.  What 
I was wondering, was this...:

1. recommended wall cavity insulation (?R-13)
2. name of my current floor insul.
3. preferred front door &quot;sealing&quot;...that plastic stuff I pulled off.
4. recommended carpet/padding for rear area (camper)
and...

What is the best method/supplies for the front area (driver/pass.)  I don't 
want to glue down carpet up here, but it would help deaden some sound.  I 
was considering &quot;gluing&quot; down some replacement rubber, but then where do I 
go from here.  Then I would have no insul, but a nice rubber 
surface.  Argh, I can't decide.

Thanks for the patience,
Missy:)
