&gt;the bus folk...inquiring minds need to know...don't we David..

Yeah yeah.  :)  I would like to know about those Solex 40's also - I seem
to remember a listmember in Germany is running them - Marcus Schaper.
Marcus, are you still with us?

I haven't tried removing the venturis completely, but I have bored them out
from 26 to 29mm.  Didn't make any difference in the torque curve according
to the chassis dynamometer.

&gt;I'm planning to build a somewhat strange type IV engine for my 79/75 bus
&gt;this winter...79 FI bus counter balanced crank and rods...low to mid
&gt;range cam...74 bus big valve heads...and dual carbs(hopefully
&gt;40PDSITs)...has anyone tried this on a dyno maybe, and could save me the
&gt;trouble? I'll likely do it anyways just to hear it hummmmm.

I'm going to build a similar engine - not sure on the counterbalanced crank
yet but it will have a WebCam 107i/914 cam, 1.7 or 1.8 heads and either
dual 36 or 40mm carbs.  Hydraulic valve train too.  I have to win that
rematch with Herr Gensler.  :)  And with the $300 electric supercharger, I
can take on Sami and his 6-cylinder beast (not!).

&gt;Any and all input welcome...provided it's positive...my flameproof suit
&gt;is out being repaired following my &quot;sharing your spare bus idea&quot;...was
&gt;that ever a test of my metal...zowie...

I didn't think it was such a bad idea - just not for everyone.  There are
lots of people on this list that I would happily loan my bus to, because I
know that they would treat it with the same respect that I do.
