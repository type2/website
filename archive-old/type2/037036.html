Subject: Shining up those jalousies

Dear Folks,

Mark's idea is a good one, but being a lazy creature, I like to use plain
old br*llo pads on all my dull looking aluminum stuff. It's one step and
it's amazing how quickly it shines stuff up! Be careful of scratching your
glass, though. :-( .
Frosted glass looks good on somethings, but....
