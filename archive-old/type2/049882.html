Subject: [T2] Run to the Sun (RTTS) web site

Just going through some of the web sites linked with the events page
(thought I had better, god knows what I could have linked to; oil cooler
pages!?!!? ;-o) The web site for RTTS is great, I recommend you let the
video load &amp; there is also a good T2 gallery. This site also gives a good
feel for the VW scene here in the UK.
Unfortunately I will miss it this year as Denise is due to pop sprog number
2, a week before. Festivals &amp; shows have never been the most hygienic places
_at_ the best of times, anyway go visit!
