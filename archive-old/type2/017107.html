Subject: Re: Propane Tank

Did I get ripped off or what last year when I replaced my 15 y.o.
propane tank with a new one, exactly the same though, for about $675
(again in Canadian pesos, but still kind of expensive: I'm going to
apply for a green card soon!)? The old one was too old to fix, and after
a couple of propane stations refused to fill it up because of its age, I
thought that getting a brand new one, certified and safe for at least 10
years, was not a bad idea. As I have to fly 2 days to get to my bus for
my too short holidays, I don't have much time to look around for a deal,
so in my case it was money well spent, and the new tank looks so good.
But if you have time, a used one is the best and cheapest way to go as
long as you get it tested and certified by an authorized propane shop
before you buy it.
