Subject: Update on Noises again (engine this time!) :-(

Hi again,
                I got a couple of emails from people suggesting ways to check the exhaust system for leaks (thanks for that) and asking for a bit more info on the bus (sorry).
 It's a '77 with the 2.0l engine and stock twin Solex carbs, stock dizzy etc.
 I'm encouraged by the suggestions on looking for exhaust leaks (I was worried I'd get lots of &quot;Oh yes, that sounds like a knackered head to me!&quot;) but how _would_ I tell if the heads or head gaskets) had failed? Should I just replace the
heat exchangers (since they need it anyway) and see if that gets rid of the blowing?

Thanks again for any input and sorry for the doubled post yesterday (I promise I won't do it again!).

Cheers,
              W.
