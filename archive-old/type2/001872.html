Hiya Mike and lists, I'm alive and breathing. Due to domain diffuclties (i
got locked out of my managment section and can't renew my domain yet,) they
should be resolved hopefully today, But the website will be down until that
time. I hope to also have the updated pages ready to upload around the same
time.
I have been working from 7am till dark trying to get the new section of shop
set up and have been terribly behind on mail and everything else for that
matter.  Sorry for any inconvience this has caused, if you have ordered
parts, e-mail me again to remind me. I have been busting my skinny rump for
almost 4 months now with this building deal and i'm severly ragged,and burnt
out, i'm headed  to HCBF last weekend in July for a 3 day break.
ps mike send me your addy in p-mail if you still need those parts. ,later
folks
