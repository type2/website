Subject: The Turn Signal Blues
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Greetings to the LIst,

I need some advice from the electrical types out there.  70 Bus.  Pretty much 
all stock.  It had a crummy turnsignal switch (would not hold the turn) on 
when I got the bus a couple of months ago so I tried replacing the springs in 
the switch with those from a donor.  No luck.  Finally got a hold of a good 
switch with a real positive action.  Removed the old switch and replaced with 
new (used, but as I mentioned, in good shape) one.  
This one holds both right and left turns until cancelled.  Great!  But the 
dash indicator lights will not blink on a right turn.  They come on 
momentarilly when the turn is first signaled and then they are dark.  However 
the signals are operating outside.  The left turn signals work great inside 
and out.
Question.........is this the switch or the flasher relay?  Common sense would 
tell me it's the switch.  Both left and right indicators flashed with the old 
switch.  On the other hand I've had experiences with &quot;funky flashing&quot; and it 
has been the relay at fault.  By the way, the emergency flashers work just 
fine.
Is there any way to trace this down without pulling out the turnsignal switch 
again?  I'm not looking forward to ripping the dash completely apart again.
