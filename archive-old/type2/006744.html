Subject: Knock when Steering?

I've got a 73 westy that has the tendency to make some large noises when
steering tight corners.  Any ideas as to the cause/fix-it on this?

Also...what is the procedure to check the fuel gauge.  Mine doesn't work,
and I understand that it is a bear (engine out) to change the sending
unit...maybe it's the gauge itself??? wiring??

Thanks in advance-
Marc
