&gt; I found a 77 aircooled Vanagon for sale. It appears to be in decent
&gt; shape
&gt; but needs some work. I wanted to know if it will be hard to get
&gt; parts for
&gt; this late model. Also, I wanted to know where I might find a manual
&gt; for
&gt; this particular van. Maybe I can find another deal out there. Is
&gt; there a
&gt; classified for VW camper vans?

Hey there David,

A 77 bus wouldn't be a Vanagon, as Vanagons weren't made till 1980. 

If you goto my webpage (link in sigline) you'll find links to several
resources that I compiled when I was researching the purchase of my
first baywindow bus in 1998. There are links to some great buyers
guides (on the main page), and a listing of the manuals available for
the baywindow buses (click on the Vw Books button). Repair manuals
are available from several sources. I think I got mine from
http://www.busdepot_dot_com .

Parts for the 70's buses are easy enough to obtain (w/ a few
exceptions). Click on the VW Links and scroll down to the vendors
section for some of the major VW bus retailers. 

If you goto the Classifieds section, I've listed the online vw sites
that I surfed looking for my bus. The most active ones are on the web
are http://www.type2_dot_com and http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw . I found my
first bus in a local newspaper, and my current one by way of a LiMBO
list member, so keep your eyes and ears open. You never know when a
good deal will pop up.

Good luck in your search, and I hope this helps,
