Subject: Re: [T2] Charcoal Filter??



&gt; Mike:
&gt; Because gasoline evaporates even when the engine is not running. The 
gasoline
&gt; vapors are stored in the activated carbon, then flushed into the air 
cleaner when
&gt; the engine is running. Simple enough.

I have seen cars (Subarus) that simply vent the gas tank to the air 
cleaner.  Anything they can do to contain the fumes until the engine 
starts will get them past the smog standards.  I don't know if recent 
Subarus do it the same way or if they have gone to charcoal canisters.
