Hi Folks,

I recently bought a 1979 Standard Campmobile, and discovered that the 
odometer is dead (the speedo works, though).  Does anybody know of any 
vendors that sell new, used, or NOS 90mph speedos that would work in my bus? 
  If not, does anybody have a speedo from their parts bus that they would be 
willing to sell?  Bonus question: How about one of those speedos with the 
optional trip odometer?

Thanks to all the folks who make the list great and owning a VW 
worthwhile...
