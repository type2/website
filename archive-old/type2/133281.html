&gt; Man, the whole bus cost $600, its a BEATER bus, will
&gt; never be anything but a beater bus. This is not some
&gt; big $$ restoration, we're not going to pay $160 for a
&gt; fuel pump when it can be done for $39!! BEATER BUS!!!
&gt; Would you really pay that cash for a fuel pump on a
&gt; beat up old ratty bus???

depends, do you also cut corners on your brakes???? steering???

a beater bus if put on the road should at least be safe, both to you and
to the other folks on the road,....don't mess with,
go-stop-turn-see-be seen parts.

muck around with the looks and sound and comfort parts.
