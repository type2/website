Subject: Re: Disc brake problems

I had similar problems with my 74. Turned out to be a bad brake booster.
The brake booster would not release the m/c completely. I found out
after I swapped everything else ... Check whether there is fluid in your
brake booster. The easiest way to do so, is pulling the vacuum hose out
of the booster and stick a small hose (like windshield washer tubing) in
there and try to syphon any fluids out. Watch out - if it is water it'll
be rusty and it may also be/contain brake fluid. If there is brake fluid
present, you need to replace/rebuild your m/c also. On my van, the
booster is connected to vacuum, but what caused it to go bad was the
water inside. So this may or may not apply to your situation. I have no
idea how a not connected booster would behave. My $0.02 worth ...

Hello all, I'm hoping someone can help with an aggravating problem that
has 
me stumped. Last year I converted my 70 Westy to disc brakes by
swapping in a 
beam from a 73. I replaced the master cylinder (Varga) and rubber lines
but 
didn't rebuild the calipers. I did take one apart to see if the piston
was 
sticking but it was rust and gunk free. At this time I do not have the
power 
booster hooked up to vacuum but there are hoses on it to reduce the 
possibility of wind under the bus causing a vacuum and engaing the
booster.

Here's the problem; ever since I did the swap, after I drive the bus
for 
about 5 miles or so the front brakes start to drag, eventually they
will lock 
up if I don't stop and crack open a bleeder. Once I release the
pressure from 
either side, the brakes back off and  I can continue, starting  the
cycle all 
over again. I replaced the original brake lever with one from a 71
since the 
arm is just different enough to make it difficult to achieve the proper

amount of freeplay at the master. 

I seem to recall another lister mentioning that if you can get the
brakes to 
release just by opening a bleeder then it must be the brake lines. The
units 
I installed are nice new German pieces that I bought at BFY. Is it
possible 
that they are bad? I am on my second Varga master, what are the chances
a new 
ATE unit would fix this problem? When the brakes start to drag there is
no 
freeplay at the pedal, once I release the pressure, they work normal. 
I did 
a similar swap about 12 years ago and had no problems, but I'm m pretty
sure 
I did
