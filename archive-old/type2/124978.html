Subject: Giacomo's back

Thanks to the generosity of a friend, we'll be getting Giacomo back form the
mechanic next week.  After 6 months without a daily driver, and without our
bus, it'll be great to have him back.

Just a few minor things to get back together (like the seal in the engine
compartment), and it'll be bus time again.

Whoo-hoo! :O)
