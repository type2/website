Subject: Re: [T2] Insurance on fire - 80 Westy

Do not agree to their prices until you are satisfied. They are off the hook 
after you accept the check.

You CAN dicker (negotiate) with them.

&gt;Hi,
&gt;
&gt;I joined the list to get advice - my poor 1980 Westy caught fire last
&gt;night and burned completely. It had 130,00 overall, rebuilt engine in
&gt;1985. An independent agency for the insurance company (State Farm) will
&gt;determine the current retail price...any advice, commentary, etc....
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;
