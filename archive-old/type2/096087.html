&gt; Has anyone found a good 13mm box end wrench for adjusting valves.
&gt; I've tried several, none have a really good fit, and the angle seems awkward.
&gt; Consequently, the nuts are rounding off with each adjustment.
&gt; thanks Crisp

I use a socket to break em loose and final tighten back up to torque.  so
actual adjusting is done with basically anything, even your fingers if
engine is cool.
