&gt; Cons: They've become too well recognized and are worth too much

[...]

&gt; and if it gets damaged (or pieces lost) it's not easily replaced.  When
&gt; attached to the bus, I find it becomes just a hallway into the bus and it
&gt; limits airflow through the bus.

The hallway point is well taken -- gets tramped through a lot.  I don't
notice the airflow problem as much myself, though.

Last weekend I left mine at the site while we went tubing and I was a
bit nervous about it -- but, like the bus, I'm gonna just use it up. 
Can't let myself get worked up about theft/damage/wear beyond reasonable
precautions.  What's the alternative - sell?  Store?  T'heck with that. 
These vehicles and tents are material commodities that were meant to be
used and used up.  Nothing quite as ironic as a simple, rugged concept
being treated like a delicate museum piece -- a tendency in myself that
I really have to guard against.

I guess eventually I'll get one of the newer, lighter models from Steve
(http://EuroCampers_dot_com/).  Maybe even eventually get a Detroit pickup
with a topper and a rear tent.  But until then there's nothing like an
original DriveAway attached to the bus at night, with my colorful string
of NewBeetle RV lights along the front (wish I could find some that look
like little busses).  As my 13-year-old daughter said on the last
campout - &quot;Sure does look welcoming!&quot;
