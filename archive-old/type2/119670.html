&lt;&lt; &gt; I haven't seen any Type2_dot_com posts in my mailbox for months.
&gt; Has AOL tagged type2_dot_com as a spammer and blocked the mail?
&gt; I miss all the good information and the amusing diversions.

Probably.  The list has been quite active.

You might try contacting AOL directly...I went through this with
another list I'm on...As did other AOL subscribers to that list...
You don't happen to have a Mac, do you...?
