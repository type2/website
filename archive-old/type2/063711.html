Subject: M-code plates on breadloafs?

Hey all:

        I friend asked I to help his brother decipher the history of his
breadloaf.  Seeing as I am not all that familiar with the post-'67
Bus, I wanted to know if they have M-Code plates like those found
behind the passenger seat in the late splitties?  If so are they
located in the same place and do the M-Codes have the same meanings?
If not, is there something equivalent to the M-Code plate [on the
door-jam or under the dash] and how does one decipher the meaning of
such a plate?

Bugs &amp; Things &amp; Splits...Oh, my!

Roy
