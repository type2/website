Hi all,

Rather than hunt around for something that fits I get my steel wheels custom
made, I'm running 7&quot;x15&quot; on the rear of my bus with 235/75/15 tires and got
the wheels made so it all fits under the guards, it also means I got an
equal amount of the exta rim width inboard and outboard which should help
reduce bearing wear and keep the offset close to standard (I think).  These
wheels were only $120AUD which over here is very reasonable and because I
use the bus offroad the centers are 10mm thick, they're indestructable :)

I also got front 6&quot;x15&quot; ($110AUD) wheels made as well and run 205/75/15s
with no clearance problems and so far no bearing problems again due to being
able to take the offset into account.  I did run Ford wheels but all they
did was stuff bearings.....

Also that tool for removing axle nuts it's know as a &quot;flogging spanner&quot; over
here and in the UK I think.  Mostly because you beat it with a BFG.

Cheers
Steve
