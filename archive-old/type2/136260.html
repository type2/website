Subject: Re: VDO oil temp gage fluctuation

Phil,
  your ground has come loose.. the sender should have two leads.. one
for power the other for ground. You may not have the ground lead and
have been depending on the metal to metal contact of the dipstick for
ground.. when the vibration goes up with the engine RPM's it is going
intermittent.. check for the ground.. if it isnt there install one.

&gt; Subject: VDO oil temp gage fluctuation
&gt; The VDO oil temp gage w/dipstick sender that has been on my 70 bus
&gt; for about 
&gt; 25 years has started fluctuating wildly. The fluctuation varies from
&gt; almost 
&gt; full range to very small oscillations. No fluctuation when the bus is
&gt; not 
&gt; moving.
