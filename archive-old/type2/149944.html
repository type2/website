Subject: Re: [T2] Rims on the 68 DC

They are 14&quot;, 5 bolt, wide bus pattern painted bright white. They are just
typical 68-70 rims. Do you need actual backspacing measurements?

Sometimes people paint them different colors, but they are all the same.

&gt; Hi all, There are many different rims on my truck. Would any of you know which
&gt; rims came stock with the 68 dropgate truck. I have three different types at
&gt; this point. John Bybee P.S. thank for the M code info
