Subject: help! On trip in trouble.

I am on my way out to wisconsin from PA.
I stopped at my inlaws in Allentown before going on the long leg of my journy.

Started out this morning.
Drove a mile or two and the bus died right before I was about to take off from a stop.
I turned the key it seemed to start so I pulled out.
It quit and although it was in gear going down a hill would not bump start itself.

I kept trying to start it.
It would fire and die as soon as I stop running the starter.
Finaly it did start again and went back to my inlaws.

On the way it did this 4 or 5 more times.

When its running it does not sound rough.
And I believe each time it died it as idleing or close to it.

fuel filter is a month old.

Fuel Pump?
Coil?
?
?

If you have any thoughts please reply.

Jason
