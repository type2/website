I've never seen a VDO gauge that allows user calibration (changing the gauge 
reading to read accurately).  However if you know your gauge reads say 50 
degrees too high you can mentally compensate or better yet mark the gauge 
face to indicate the accurate temperatures.
The reason I say sump senders read the case temp is the ones I've seen are 
made of brass (a good conductor) have a large cross section and are 
physically attached to the sump, which is physically attached to the case.  
Metals are excellent heat conductors.  If you had a fine gauge thermocouple 
extending into the oil 3/8&quot; you would measure very close to the actual temp 
of the oil.  However if you have a 1/4&quot; diameter brass rod extending 3/8&quot; 
into the oil you will measure very close to the actual temp of the large mass 
of metal that the brass rod is attached to.

Just because you are measuring case temp isn't necessarily bad.  It's a good 
indicator of how hot your engine is.  It's also an indicator of your oil 
temp.  It's just slow to react and around 20 degrees lower than your oil 
temp.  So if you're going up a mountain and your sump sender is saying 210 
degrees your oil temp is probably 30 degrees higher than that. This is the 
time to take your foot out of it or pull over and run your engine at a fast 
idle for a couple of minutes.

I think the sump sender is a fine location too.  Just keep in mind what 
you're reading and your engine will last you a long time.
