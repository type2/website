&gt; I just read the JustKampers chat site and found an interesting post for
&gt; Westy owners. This chap has put up scanned images of his 1972 westy manual.
&gt; Cool piccies and interesting text on how the stuff should work :0)
&gt; Check it out at www_dot_campercrew.cwc_dot_net/projectwestphalia.html

Very nice - thanks for the tip!  FWIW, that's not a US-spec westy (check
out the cabinets, and double bed up top!).  But still some great info.
