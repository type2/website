Subject: Westy Propane Regulator deal

A friend who works for the local propane distributor just stopped by.  A 
couple weeks ago I had him go through my Westy propane tank.  When I got 
the bill I was rather astounded by the cost of the propane regulator. 
 $28.12.  I asked if he could do more at that price.  Today, he told me, 
&quot;How many more do you want?&quot;

So, if your regulator is passing gas through the vent and you need a 
replacement, drop me a line. Marshall 290. $28.12 + the postage to get 
it to you.

Note: the original regulator, Marshall 140 is no longer in production. 
The 290 is the correct two stage replacement. It's about 1&quot; (25mm) 
longer than the 140, so you have to bend your plumbing just a bit.

Jim
