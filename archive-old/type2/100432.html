Subject: Re: [T2] Daikin brand clutch for the bus? vendors?

IMHO, the Daikin clutches are excellent quality.  I researched them myself a 
few years ago, and would recommend them to anyone.

&gt;Hello,
&gt;
&gt;My mechanic said my clutch is nearly caput, and they only have Daikin brand 
&gt;clutches in stock right now, no Sachs. Any experience with them? They 
&gt;appear to be a little more pricey.
