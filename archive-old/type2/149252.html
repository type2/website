Subject: RE: [T2] Intermittent oil light

I forgot to mention that I'm using 10W-30 oil right now, Valvoline to be exact.  Engine is a 1700 dual-carb.
 
I haven't seen the oil light flicker at all, it's either on or off.

As for the engine temp: both times it has come on the engine has been cool.  No problems handling the dip stick.  I will say that there have been times when after driving home (approx 20 miles at 55mph) the engine has been so hot that I can't handle the engine compartment latch.  I discovered lots of hot air blowing into the engine compartment from the empty holes that run to the heat exchangers.  I plugged those up and the engine seems to run cooler now.
 
To clarify a little about the thermostat: the thermostat control cable is running around the pulley and up to the flaps but it is broken around where it would attach to the thermostat.  I'm not sure what's going on there but I was told it fails in the &quot;fully-cooled&quot; state so not to worry about it as my first priority.
 
Thanks,
--Mitchell

Mitch,

How hot is the engine after you pull over when the oil light comes on?  Would you be comfortable handling the dipstick with your bare hands?  

Does the oil light ever come on or flicker while the engine is idling, e.g. at a red light?

What weight of oil are you using?
