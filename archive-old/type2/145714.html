Subject: Re: [T2] KONI Group Buy Shocks now available again!

I can't afford to spend a chunk like that at one time, (Professional  care giver for Mom right now) but for years I've bought tires in pairs,  moved the old front ones to the back and always kept the front's  (steering) in good shape.  I've never had much problem with rear  tires.  Of course, most of these vehicles have been FWD.  I  just bought my first pair of Hancooks and have done quite a few things,  mentioned here, to the front to get ready for the trip to  Everybus.  I don't think it makes sense to tell someone to wait  until they have the money to do all four shocks or tires.   I  wouldn't advise buying singles but the front and the rear are different  and mostly independent of each other.  Anything you upgrade is  better than nothing.  And yes, I'll buy two of these next and put  them up front and see how she handles.  I'll feel comforted  knowing I've still got two good oil-filled shocks in the rear until I  can afford it.  And the rears will eventually get a good used set 
 of Hancooks from the front and I'll have 4.  JMHO but I'm open to  constructive criticism.  Cheers....KR

&gt;Does that make sense?

While  adjustable, they adjust according to the range of damping rates set by  Koni so I think adjusting the shock from soft to firm in order to match  it against a soft oil filled shock like a Boge or a firm gas shock like  a KYB with different damping rates will be difficult.
