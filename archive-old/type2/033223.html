Subject: Oh where oh where can my vacuum leak be

Volks,

First off, thanks to all you guys who were willing to give an old southerm
bonehead the benefit of your knowledge.  I don't think I could have gotten
this far without your help and encouragement.  Its nice to know there are
still nice guys in the world.  I hope I can help you sometime in the future.

Well I got the AVP engine (2.0L FI) cranked, it seems to run sweet.  Boy,
when they talk about those hydraulic lifters being noisey at first they
really mean it don't they.  I thought the damn thing was about to throw a
rod. But now its just purring like a kitten.

As always there is just one last little problem.  I hear this noise and I
can't decide if it's a vacuum leak or not.  I replaced all the hoses when I
installed the engine and I've jiggled everything I can get my hands on but
it just makes the same noise, like a tire with a leak in it.....shissssssssss.

What are the symptoms of a vacuum leak, and how do you find it if you cant
put your finger on it. The engine seems to run great, I can turn the key
and it cranks and idles without touching the gas and the one time I drove
it it ran good with no skips.  When I put my ear up close it seems like the
noise is coming from the intake distribution box (the round bubble like
thing inbetween the the intake manifolds).  

What should I do next??  I'm afraid to drive it because of all the things
I've read on here that a vacuum leak can do to an engine.

As alway your help is greatly appreciated. I hope to see some of you at the
Little Ogmulgee campout on Dec 10, 11 and 12.
