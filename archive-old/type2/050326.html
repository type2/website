&gt; The Euro 1600 does use a rear engine support. It is bolted to the case with

&gt; too long.

Don't even trust the stock bolts!  I've found that even the stock bolts
bottom out in some cases.  I always carefully fit the moustache bar to the
engine and make sure that I can run the bolts down all the way by hand.
If not, I stack washers until I can do so.  At this point, I add a thin
wave washer and snug it down.

It might be a good idea to shorten the bolts rather than stack washers,
but if you do mark them left and right so that the correct one always goes
into the correct hole.

Of course, always be sure that there is enough thread engagement to carry
the load.  Never had a problem with this but you never know!
