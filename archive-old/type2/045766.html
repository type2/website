&gt;Many years ago, I bought a set of snap-on pullers (everyone has one
&gt;snap-on tool, this is mine :-) for way too much money and thru the years I
&gt;have never regretted it.  If you have a 3-jaw puller, it fits right under
&gt;the three bolt ears of the hub, If you have a 2-jaw puller, it will fit
&gt;under the locating pin ear and the bolt ear opposite that.  I would
&gt;recommend inserting bolts in the holes in the ears to prevent distortion
&gt;while pulling (don't know if it works, but I do it habitually)

This method did not work for me either.  I succeeded in bending the ears.  The only thing worse than a fan hub stuck to the crank is a *bent* fan hub stuck to the crank.  My fan wobbled after that.  I was not able to bend it back so I ended up filing the surface down flat to solve the problem.  The next time I faced pulling the hub, I took the crank to a machine shop and let them do it.  You can split the case without removing the hub.
