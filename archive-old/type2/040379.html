Subject: Long Weekend Trip Report

I just got back from up north to Algonquin Provincial Park where I spent my 
long weekend up here in Canada. I left friday and headed north towards the 
park from Kingston, arrived there about 3-3 1/2 hours later there were no 
bus sightings today as I left early to beat the rush of traffic. On Saturday 
while driving around the park to pick up various supplies, I saw a Eurovan 
Westfalia and a Vanagon Westfalia we all exchanged waves and it brought a 
smile to my face as I kept on driving down the highway. As Sunday rolled 
around I decided to head back into town to pick up a canoe and on the way 
saw another Vanagon Westfalia and exchanged a wave with them. The weather 
was excellent, not a cloud in the sky for the whole weekend and 20+ degrees 
Celcius all weekend. I headed back on Monday night and made the trip with no 
problems at all, The Bus was running well, I figure I got close to 25 Mpg 
and it didn't run hot and didn't burn much oil. So if any of you Canadian 
listees saw a cream coloured Riveria with tinted windows driving around the 
park on the weekend that was me.
