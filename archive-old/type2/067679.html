Subject: Heat problems solved!

Well, I finally figured out how to get the right amount of heat in my
bus...without extra insulation or special tubes and fans running all over
the place. And to think, it was right under my nose all of this time.

Thanks to my uncle, cousin Jeb of Hoxie, Arkansas, I now have a small,
sturdy wood heater installed where that damn fold-up table used to be in the
bus. All we had to do was take the carpet out, cut off a little of that
cushun behind the driver's side seat (it kept catchin on fire), and bolt
that puppy down through the floor. A pair of tin snips cut a hole right
through the top of the bus and we ran the pipe straight up. It doesn't
interfere at all with the pop top, in fact, I set a rack of fish up there
and it smoked 'em up good. It leaked a little around the pipe at first, but
we tarred up that hole and now it's fine.

We took the back seat/folding bed out and installed a wood rack. Looks great!

Now we're working on getting a child-sized waterbed cushun for the back of
the bus--for camping. I figure I can fill it with beer and the kids can
sleep on it until it gets too low; then they can just bed down in the grass,
like they do at home.

So quit all this fretten and fussin over heat in yurn buses. Cousin Jeb will
help you install your heater too! Call him at: 501-555-9807. Tell him
Redbone sent you! Oh and don't fergit to vote today. Remember, vote YES on
proposition 12, which repeals all those pesky in-breeding laws. 

Okay, it may not be Friday, but with the choices we have/don't have at the
polls, I figure all us state-side folks need a little laugh today. ;) Joe
