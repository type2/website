Subject: Re: [T2] stranded in northern Virginia, urgent help needed

Hey guys  I would offer to help but I am 5 hours from him!!  He is closer to 
Ronnie who is in Richmond  .   His best bet is to probably wait for karl to 
return.  Maybe what he needs to do is get towed to karls and camp there till he 
returns.  Let me know if I can help  later  and have fun  Mark Dearing    Work
