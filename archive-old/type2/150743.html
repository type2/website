Subject: Re: [T2] air tools

&amp;lt;&amp;lt;          How do I know how much pressure to run
my air tools at? Is there a rule of thumb for the general amount of
pressure for each tool (DA, Air Ratchet, Impact Wrench, Cut Off Tool,
etc.), or do you just run everything at full pressure?&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

I have the regulator on My Curtis 80 gal. dual stage compressor set at
150 lbs.
The regulator is mounted on the wall at the compressor, with a dryer and
4 outlet manifold.

I can run 4 air lines off of it--- clean dry air


&amp;lt;&amp;lt; Is there any reason to dial it back for some things?&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

All the air tools I have have regulator's on them ---all except my Binks
guns--and I added them onto the inlet of them---I can infinitely dial
them in from the gun rather than running back to the regulator.

&amp;lt;&amp;lt;          Most of the tools I have say to oil
daily. What do I oil them with? Is there some special air too oil? How
much do I drop in?&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

A couple of good sized drops ( small trickle) of Marvel Mystery Oil will
do them good.
Oil them when your done with them, just before putting them away.
If in fact you have any condensation in the lines, the oil will keep
them fro rusting up if you don't use them for awhile.

Do Not Use an automatic oiler in any air line.
The oil will soften up the interior liner of the hose and make it weak
over time, and in the event you want to paint anything and do forget
which hose is which--you couldn't buy enough Smoothy to stop the fish
eyes in the paint.
The hose (s) would be junk for painting forever.


&amp;lt;&amp;lt;          Anything else you can think of to extend
the life of the tools/compressor that I should know? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;

Change the oil in the compressor often using non detergent 30 weight
oil, and drain the tank daily---dump that condensation just as you shut
it off.
Do unplug it--(switch it off) when you leave.
A blown air hose could fry the compressor while your gone, and ruin your
day--

Big Time.
