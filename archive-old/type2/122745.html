Subject: Re: [T2] door panel clips

I dont have an exact count on the number of clips, as I didn't count 
them when I last had my door's stripped down, BUT I do know that there 
&quot;should&quot; be little rubber grommets in the holes in the door for the 
clips to sink into, keep it snug and not rattle around. I found that I 
was short a few when I pulled my panels to cut speakers, I still 
haven't gotten around to finding any replacements but I would think BD 
would have some.

Steve

&gt; Anyone know how many clips are on each front door panel of a 73 Westy? 
&gt;  Are the clips supposed to go straight into the metal (door)?
&gt; thanks, Chris
