Denny,

This is inconclusive at best, but fwiw:

I have two new in the box cv's in my hand. One is GKN, the other Lobro (who
are essentially the same company) The GKN unit has the stepped face opposite
the groove, like your new one. The Lobro joints have no step on the hub at
all. Go figure.

I would believe it to be very unlikely for a CV joint to be assembled
incorrectly at the factory, if that is your concern. Also, if the hub and
cage will rotate off axis, it is installed correctly. The hub will not
rotate if it is installed inside out. New CV's are very stiff to rotate in
this way unlike used ones, but they will move if persuaded.
