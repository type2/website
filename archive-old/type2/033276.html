&gt; I can only speak from what I know but my AW as does Nikkis has a structural

&gt; the partition. It is the outer lip of the over cab storage compartment(luv
&gt; those AdventureWagens!) 

Nope, dah-link, I don't have one of those. I just have a cut edge where
they popped the roof open with a giant can opener and put wood in to
make the front of the overhead storage compartment. So there is where
our busses must differ, being bench and walk-thru. Hmmm. Unless you're
talking about the ... light bulb goes on, OH! ... the structural
cross-pieces *in* the roof!? Those are standard VW factory shtuff I read
somewhere -- you can't open the roof up bigger than where those things
are (I'm being very technical, I know).

Where'd you read that the bar is a structural piece? I'm curious....
