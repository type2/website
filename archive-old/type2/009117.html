&gt; The essence of the California bill, is that if the car is sent in
&gt; as part of the Accelerated Vehicle Retirement program (voluntary,
&gt;  or not) it is crushed.  Parts cannot be taken from any vehicle that
&gt; is to be scrapped under the program.

&gt; 
&gt; is it kosher for me to part a car out and then
&gt; get it crushed?  how much money is the &quot;crush me&quot;
&gt; transaction worth?  

In order to be eligible for the program, the car has to be in running
order.

The wrecking yards would normally be against such a program, but the
smog folks got them on their sides by letting them run the program and
sell the scrap iron.
