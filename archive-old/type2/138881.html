&gt; To pass smog the engine fuel and emissions systems must be 100% stock
&gt; as manufactured. It must be equipped with California standards

&gt; per stock. You will be tested to standards the same as that year and
&gt; model equipped with Calif smog equipment and licensed in California.

Antonio,

In other words you need an EGR valve (junkyard) and EGR filter (Bus Depot)
and catalytic converter (Bus Depot) and the bus needs to have the factory
fuel injection system.

You'll also need to have a gas cap that seals properly because they will
test that also.

It used to be that the smog tech did a visual inspection, then checked the
tuning, then the exhaust and then your gas cap. If you failed at any stage
they stopped the test and you failed.

Now the visual test is done last. Even though they know you will fail (if
you have carbs instead of FI or you are missing your CAT etc), it's the
government's way of allowing the testers to make money off you. Simply
criminal.

&gt; You will want to have the bus in optimal state of tune and maintenance
&gt; for most efficient and cleanest running, with all tuning done to
&gt; factory specs.

Don't go by the specs. Tune it to the CA guidelines:

http://159.145.15.175/ftp/pdfdocs/asm_ph43.pdf

Someone on the list recently failed, had the VW dealer put it in &quot;spec&quot; and
it failed again.

Your bus is like mine: category #10: truck under &lt; 6000 lbs.

You need to do a complete tuneup and adjust the mixture using an exhaust
analyzer. Too rich is the #1 reason people fail the test.

&gt; You may not be into spending that kind of money if not necessary, but
&gt; if you do, wait till you get to San Diego because if your fuel mixture
&gt; is rich, you will burn up the new unit on the trip. Ask for a smog
&gt; pre-test before they start.

Since you are coming from out of state I'm not sure if you can just stop at
any smog station and get tested. First of all, they've divided up the
testing between test-only and test-repair stations.

Certainly you won't be able to register at the DMV without your smog test.
You might have to go to the smog referee but perhaps not since the bus was
already registered in CA at one time. Look into this before you drive down.

&gt; That way you will know if it will pass or
&gt; not. Much better than doing the official test and getting labelled in
&gt; DMV computers as a gross polluter which will make your life miserable!

It's very important not to exceed those GP limits on the first test.
Otherwise you'll be smogging every year instead of every two from then on.

Keep asking questions if you have any doubts. Be informed before you go.
