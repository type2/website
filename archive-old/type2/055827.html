&gt;When I do, I'm gonna try to borrow the fiche and use the
&gt;fiche-to-disk appartus at my local university research
&gt;library to make some copies.

It really suprises me but even in the days of VW uk being linked by
microwave etc they still use micro fiche. Our parts guys must waste hours
looking for parts numbers etc.

&gt;By the way, I think the trick is to find a VW dealer where there is
&gt;someone still there from the aircooled era; this way, instead of being
&gt;treated like a freak, you'll be a break from the routine work of
&gt;servicing water-cooleds, an opportunity for a little nostalgia, and a
&gt;chance for the old guy to show the young turks that he knows more than
&gt;them.

The nearest we ever get is a guy who brings in his Type 25 W/C hightop
camper and a couple of Type 25 Caravels. One mechanic triend on A/C and Audi
quottros and drives an Audi V8 (it is in the body shop at the moment so he
is in a Nissan Micra) and he is really jelous of my camper so I get all my
help for free.
