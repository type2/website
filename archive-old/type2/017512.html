My dear Matilda (71 Westy) is very happy these days.  i just finally tuned
up her 1600 cc dual carbed motor.  She has plenty of power and drivability,
but I would like to lessen the toll that interstate driving takes on her. 
I currently hover around 4000-4100 rpm at 65.  I would like to get some
info on how to drop the RPM down a couple hundred rpm, hopefully to add
some miles onto the new motors life (and hopefully some gas mileage.  Any
help/advice would be appreciated on things like cost, ratios, etc..

Thanks
71 Westy, Matilda
