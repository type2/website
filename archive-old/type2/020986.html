&gt; I am running a Berg oil pump relief cover on my '71 Westy.  As I recall, I
&gt; added a couple of washers between the hanger and the case to gain the extra
&gt; clearance.  No problems in two years.  Berg suggests hammering the hanger to
&gt; get the clearance, but I wouldn't cut any metal out.

I used the Berg pressure relief cover and the available 45 degree fitting with
no interference with the rear hanger.
