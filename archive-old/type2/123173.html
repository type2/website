&gt; Thanks for the responses about the tires.  Despite the higher price,

&gt; protection, though, since I'd hate to have to replace them at $90 a tire 

I have run nothing but michelins on all my buses, expensive tires but get
lots of mileage so they are probably competitive on a per mile basis.

I run 205x70r 14 these are 99S rated heavy duty tires, and very similar to
the Agelis tires, unfortunately they are no longer made in the 205 size
but the 195 is still avaliable, and were recently on sale at NTB.
