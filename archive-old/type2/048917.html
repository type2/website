Subject: [T2] Brake lines:

Hey List,

    Just a quick warning about all the damage Turkey grease can do to your
key board!

                                                 Happy Holliday!!
    With all the discussion about hard line tubing for brakes, I thought I
would remind everyone to be sure and use &quot;Seemless Steel Tubing&quot;, and
&quot;Double Flare&quot; ends. Never use &quot;Compression Fittings&quot; or &quot;Copper&quot; tubing for
brakes. Always mount any length (run) of tubing over about a foot long to a
solid surface. Never run tubing near the exhaust, or any moving object.
    Play safe!
