Aside from the clickety noise I'd be concerned about lubrication. At least
it was so when I was a Triumph Bonneville owner...those who went for the
&quot;chopper&quot; look by extending the fork tubes &amp; raking the engine in the
process soon fried their bearings.

&gt; I had rear end of Westy lifted, and noise was created.  Major rear end
&gt; lift, higher than level, so I have an unintended rakish look.
