Subject: Starter replacement bushing thingy...

Listees...

By trial and error I have come to the conclusion that my starter is nearly 
dead. Got push started home and had a friend took me to get a new Bosch 
starter.

I've read up on the Bentley procedure for installing the starter and I don't 
understand what the little round bushing thingy does?

The procedure seems really straightforward with the exception of the bushing 
included with the new starter and sylenoid.

Thanks as always,
Daniel
