Subject: Re: [BP] Bus Depot Aux Battery Relay

Hi John,

The problem is that using the coil wire as the trigger will connect  
the batteries as soon as the ignition is switched on.

If the aux battery is dead then you will be drawing extra power from  
the main battery at the same time as you are trying to start the bus.

If you use the blue wire then the relay won't connect the batteries  
until the alternator light goes out, which doesn't happen until the  
engine is running.

It'll work from the coil, but it'll be better for the main battery  
and starter if you run from the blue alternator wire.

&gt; So I mounted my spare battery today with the relay kit from bus

&gt; is wrong with using the wire from the coil that is positive when  
&gt; the bus is
&gt; running.  One side of the coil is hot when the key is turned on -  
&gt; both sides
&gt; are hot when the bus is running.  I connected to the side that is  
&gt; hot only
&gt; when the bus is running.
&gt;
&gt; Is there a problem with that?  Someone said that there was ... but  
&gt; if so ...
&gt; what is it?
