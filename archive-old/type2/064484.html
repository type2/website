That was me.  It works best when you leave it dunked in the stuff.
On your windshield, you should us a rag wetted in the stuff, keeping
it constantly wet with fresh CLR.  Once it dries, its pretty much
useless.  Keep the CLR-wetted rag on the metal.

If you don't believe me, take a rusty bolt or something, and dunk it
in a cup of the stuff overnight, and see what happens.  It also works
faster if its warm, so if you can leave it in a warm place, it will
go that much better.
