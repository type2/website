Subject: clattering '72 noise--conclusions

first, a _big_ fuzzy thank you to all who have sent their ideas about
this.  i really appreciate your help, and your moral support.

ok, so the engine is coming out tomorrow.  i guess i will just do the
entire thing, rods and mains and maybe even oil cooler (has anyone had a
bad experience with using their old one?).  my pistons, jugs, and heads
should still be okay, no?  

sadly, i must go to school in a few days, and i must therefore put this
project on hold until i return as soon as i can.  i guess i can return
and reassemble the engine when i have a chance.

i will post progress reports to tell you guys what indeed was the
problem, if i ever find out. ;)  i will likely have the engine out and
disassembled by tomorrow night, and i will tell you how it goes, and
what i find inside.  hopefully no big chunks of piston and crank
scattered around.  ;)

this is kinda weird, but i am now going to use my _triumph_ (british)
car as a backup!  who would have thought the notoriously unreliable
british car would save the day?!  

again, thanks all.

evan
