Subject: Parting out '80Westy

City has made me get rid of my parts van so I'm parting out my spare '80
Westy.
I'm probably going to keep a lot of it for spares but I will entertain
any special requests. The Campertop and canvas are in decent condition
with some small tears and holes in the screens. The cabinets and bed
will be available but I will probably keep the reefer and stove for
parts.  All the FI stuff is gone.
Annapolis, Md.
