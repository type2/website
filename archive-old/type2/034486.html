Subject: Bus Tour Handoff

We have assumed control!  Of the hubcap that is.  Derek, Jeff and I
represented the Full Moon Bus Club and met Mike and Julia south of
Myrtle Beach tonight.  We left Charleston a little after 3pm and took
the back way as far as we could because busses aren't for the main
highway of life.  We talked our way into the state park without having
to pay (an added plus!) and drove around looking for people we have
never met driving a bus we have never seen.

We parked after driving around and not seeing anything resembling the
unseen bus when they arrives horn a-tooting and smiles a grinning.  They
brought smiles, the hubcap, the case, and Mojo the dog.  We did the
ceremonial signing of the logbook, took pictures as appropriate, admired
their very sweet bus, more appropriate pictures and left much richer for
the experience of having met such nice folks.  I hope to see then again,
perhaps at Edisto Freez yer Toe or maybe High Country Bus fest

Official pictures of this astute and under-ostentatious event may be
seen with proper solemnity at the following URL:

All I did was post the pix in .jpg form for the taking and inclusion of
the official bus tour page.

While on the subject of the tour, the Full Moon Bus Club will pass the
items around amongst ourselves this week and Friday the items will be
handed to the illustrious Charles J. Ford of Georgia for further
forwarding to the esteemed Andy Pechenik of Florida.  We have yet to
receive direction from the organizer of this event as to routing so we
will do our part to get it where it's destination lies.

By the way, when this is all over what happens to the cool stuff in the
ceremonial carrying case?

Dave
