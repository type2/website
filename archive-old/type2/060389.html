Not exactly.  &quot;Water&quot; means water.  &quot;Boxer&quot; means a horizontally opposed,
or flat (180 degree V) engine.  I guess because the pistons appear to be
boxing with each other, in a backwards sort of way.  The only common
waterboxer engines (that I know of anyway) are the 83.5-91 Vanagon and the
Subaru engines.  All of the other water cooled engines are just plain
&quot;Water&quot;.
