Subject: Re: [T2] bonnaroo in TN

I'm going to Bonnaroo, but not in my bus (it's disassembled).  I might take 
the bug depending on what I can fit into it.  I'm already in the area 
(Nashville area).  But if you need help once you are here, I could probably 
help...

&gt; Hey is anybody driving their bus to the Bonnaroo festival
&gt; from points north of TN?
