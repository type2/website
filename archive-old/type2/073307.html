Hi folks

My 68 Riviera has rectangular sliding windows (2 on drivers', 1 on pass side)
that were installed during the camper conversion.  They have aluminium
frames and are pretty *tired*.  As restoration,  or at least a paint job
looms, I have thought of replacing them - does anyone know of a painless
solution for this?  It seems a properly sized replacement should be
available, maybe fron a RV or trailer manufacturer.  I have looked around a
bit, with no success as of yet.   Thanks.
