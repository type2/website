Subject: Cast iron cylinders

Hi all,
  I am thinking of building a 2165cc motor for my '78 Westy.  Does anybody 
have any first or second hand information as to whether 94mm cast iron 
cylinders will run too hot?  I don't think my budget will be able to handle 
a counterweighted stroker crankshaft and Baby Birals or Nickies too, but I 
don't want a chronicaly overheating engine either.  Also, has anybody used a 
rising rate fuel pressure regulator from Micro Dynamics with their stock 
fuel injection on a larger displacement engine?

Thanks!
Brian Zweerink
