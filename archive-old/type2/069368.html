Subject: Timing - Rule of Thumb

                                           8:08 AM             7/29/96

Given the timing thread I thought I'd on a 'bush mechanics' rule of thumb for
timing.  It's particularly useful if you're caught without a light after an
emergency point adjustment,  to get 'new' engines running 'somewhere in the
ballpark', or with a *worn* engine that runs like a dog when set to the
standard mark .........

With the engine AT IDLE, turn the distributor (advancing timing) until the
engine runs at its fastest...this point will be clearly heard...(the revs will
pick up to a 'peak' and then die as you over-advance).  Once you've found this
'peak'  turn the distributor back at bit (about 1/4 &quot; retarding timing about 3
degrees).......

If the engine won't idle, hold the throttle open so the engine is running at
the lowest revs possible and start from that point........last stop should be
with engine idling.....
