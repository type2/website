&gt; Volks,
&gt; I have a '79 2.0L FI motor and of course in a bus, I have this oil leak
&gt; thats been a pain in the butt, The leak is on #3 and #4 side of the motor, I
&gt; replaced the push rod tube gaskets, oil drain plug gasket. The seems or
&gt; looks like its leaking from #4 intake (I think) push rod tube. The oil is
&gt; also on the cooling tin and around the cylinders. I guess I need to know how
&gt; can I tell if its the cylinder seal or gasket. That is my only guess it
&gt; could be. Any ideas or comments will be highly appreciated.

That's fairly close to the oil cooler, and VW oil cooler seals are notorious
for leaking. Be sure it's not that.
