Subject: [T2] Different Seats

Has anyone ever put a different kind of front seat in a bay? I was thinking
&gt;something from the Jetta or Gold would be nice. Any body know what would
be
&gt;involved to make that work?

The easiest conversion I know of is to find some decent Vanagon seats. In
my 78' they slid right on the rails. The only problem was the outer arm
rest on the drivers seat had to be removed to clear the door. On the
passenger side it was fine but to swivel the seat you need to leave the
door open. I am thinking of removing that armrest and replacing the bolt
that holds it on with a wingnut or something. These seats are a 100% more
comfortable than the stock westy seats. Paid $100 at a bone yard. Worth
every penny as I no longer have that lower back ache after a long drive. As
always YMMV
