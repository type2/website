&gt; Ooops. It's 5:00 AM in CA, and I just woke up from a sound sleep and
&gt; realized I forgot to grease the tranny input shaft splines before putting
&gt; the engine/tranny back in last night. I don't think the clutch disk
actually
&gt; travels back and forth on the shaft during operation.._dot_can I get away with
&gt; this? I'd hate to have to rally my crew to R&amp;R the engine again....


Well, now see, this is your chance to prove to yourself that you can remove
and replace the engine single-handed! :-)

There's no science behind this opinion, but I'd be inclined to leave it be
at this point.  I'm pretty sure I haven't greased the splines each and every
time I've installed an engine, but I've never had anything bad happen as a
result.
