Subject: FULL FLOW oil modification help needed (longish &amp; technical)
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

The following text is fairly technical, I hope that some readers can picture
what I am describing. 

I need to modify a previously installed full flow oil set up, that has already
been machined into my case, but not properly. And yes I want to keep this full
flow set-up.

The problem I am having is that case metal must be removed so that the 90
degree fitting will fit behind the stock sheet metal (I call it the drip pan,
as this piece of sheet metal bolts on behind the crank pulley, and has a drip
spout at the bottom of it)

I keep milling away, and milling away metal until this fitting does not touch
the drip pan (and no... I do not want to, and will not dimple the drip pan so
that it will fit) I have milled away so much case metal that I am +/- 3/16&quot;
away from going into the oil passage leading down to the (modified - has
proper plug in the 30mm) oil pump (and I need 1/4&quot; to get this 90 degree
fitting where I want it)(so I will be in the oil pasage when I have completed
the machining process).

EVERYONE FOLLOW AT THIS POINT ?????

OK since this passage will no long be used due to installing my new full flow
system, (the oil pump plug sealing it off) this is a minor problem (milling
into the passage way) CORRECT ???? Or am I overlooking and creating a serious
problem.

ONE OF THE DRAWBACKS that I see is that when I tap this hole for threads, I
will not have the same amount of material to grab the fitting (case
material)(where this passage is), but as long as the 90 degree fitting is
threaded deep enough into the passage it needs to go in (not the passage
leading to the oil pump)(but you know that) and forms a good positive seal,
all of my worries are dumbfounded CORRECT ??? 

I prefer replies from individuals who have done this procedure, or do this
procedure often (VW machine shops). For those of you that do not know what a
FULL FLOW system is consult Gene Berg for one of his technical articles. He
can explain it better that I can.

Thanks for taking your time to read this and your knowledgeable advice to come
