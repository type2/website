&gt; All you need are 20 alloy wheel lug nuts to put the Vanagon alloys on a 
&gt; bay.
&gt; 
&gt; Why do you want a used set of rear Vanagon studs?
&gt; 
&gt; They are the same as bay studs.....
&gt; 
    I have M-B alloys on my Bay and use PVC caps (from the plumbing
supply house - a nickel apiece) painted to match the body color over
the stock lug nuts... ;-)
