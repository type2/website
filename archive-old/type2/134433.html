Subject: Re: [T2] Describe this emotion..... and some help.

  So its I actually pulled it out of the garage.  The
&gt; kids didn't know the garage was so big, ut it's
&gt; leaking oil from the flange where the heat exchanger
&gt; connects to the muffler.  Where is it coming from?  I
&gt; am also seeing white smoke from the muffler.  So I'm
&gt; happy, but dreading what this problem may really be.
&gt;
I agree with John in that the oil tends to drip onto the heat exchangers,
rather than oil actually leaking from the exchangers. That drip usually
provides us VW drivers with a characteristic odor of 'VW'! Check the push
rod tubes, and check the headcover gaskets for oozing leaks.
As far as the white smoke....I'm not exactly sure. I ran across white smoke
when I first got my Fastback. The first time I started it up after sitting
in PO's yard for 6 years, it blew tons of white smoke. I just figured that
the rings were frozen. Check your oil for metal flakes. I hope you don't
find any!
Good luck!
