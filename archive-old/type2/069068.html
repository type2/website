Subject: Painted my knobs

Hi folks,

Lately I've noticed the headlight, interior light and wiper knobs on my '71
are showing their age. The white painted symbols on the face of the knobs
were either worn off or faded, so today I pulled the knobs out of the bus,
washed them well with soap and water, and repainted the symbols.

Here's how I did it quickly, neatly, and easily:  I used some gloss white
polyurethane enamel that I had lying around.  I suppose you could use any
paint you want--maybe even that glow-in-the-dark stuff if you want to get
fancy, but gloss white enamel was what I had handy--so I used it.  The
plastic surface of the knob is stamped with the symbol so even where the
original paint was completely worn off, the stamping was still there as a
guide for where the new paint should go.  Instead of buying a special
modeler's fine point brush, I just used a safety pin, picked up a drop of
paint, and guided it into the stamping.  I don't have a particularly steady
hand so the paint inevitably went outside the lines. I just continued to
fill all of the stamped area with paint and then used wooden toothpicks to
wipe away the paint that fell outside the lines.  The wooden point on the
toothpicks clear the excess paint away very evenly and don't scratch the
plastic surface.   Once the tip of one toothpick gets too contaminated with
paint, I used another fresh one until all the excess paint was removed.

This didn't take long at all and now the knobs look brand new (like
something you'd buy from RMMW for $13.95 ;).  Anyhow, I thought I'd pass
this along to the '68-up bus owners who want to do something on their bus on
a cold or rainy day, but don't want to get greasy :).
