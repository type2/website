You are right, hyd. lifters are not adjusted as normal maintance like the 
solids. Rebuilds, major repairs (involving lifters,push rod and such) or when 
you replace worn or defective lifers are the usual time for adjustment. 
Depending how far gone the lifter is or how long the engine sets without 
running, most lifters will quite down with a minute or so up to ten minutes, 
how ever long it takes to pump lifter up with oil vice air. On a new rebuild 
you need to pump-up (bleed) lifters before you install. Bentley tells how to 
adjust hyd lifters, I find it better to adjust after engine has been warmed 
up (hyd lifters only)and lifters are good and pumped (no air). If after 
running engine and you still have soft lifters you may want to look into 
replacing them (the bad one). After removing valve cover, align like you are 
going to set and check each lifter, when you push on kurled end of rocker arm 
with flat head screw driver(push rod side) it should be soild (no give) if it 
is spongy, it may be bad and in need of replacement. And with any repair job 
ensure you replace gaskets with new ones, don't reuse gaskets, VW's leak 
enough without any help from used gaskets. Ensure all surfaces are spotless 
for better sealing. If it ain't broke don't fix it. If it quites down after a 
few minutes, don't worry about it, that's normal.
