&gt; The positive is it is inexpensive, much smaller then the original ammonia
&gt; powered rig in the late westies (so it has a better chance of fitting in
&gt; the upright cooler early westies), draws about 6 Amps which I think is
&gt; about the same as the ammonia powered rig.
&gt; 
&gt; The negative is it still uses 12V so you can't run it for long when
&gt; stopped. An RV fridge, though $$$ big bucks, is usually 3 way,
&gt; 12V/120V/propane which means you can run it all weekend when camping.

FWIW, the 3 way fridges are pretty inefficient in comparision most
12v only fridges (from what I understand), so it might be worth your
trouble to spend and extra couple hundred bucks installing a deep-cycle
battery and battery isolator for your fridge.  If you're looking at 
stopping for *days* as opposed to hours, you might also look into 
getting one of the flexible solar panels that rolls up like a tarp
and just hooking that up when you're stopped for long periods.  This
requires some sun and a bit more wiring, but...

In any case 6A isn't a lot, so you might be able to get away with
just a battery...
