Subject: Re: [T2] questions about sliding windows on a late bay

&gt;   Pros/cons of the jalousies vs
&gt; the sliders?
&gt;

The louvered windows are the only ones on the busses that use screws. All
other windows, the sliders included, use the seal to hold them in place.

You must have the seal for solid windows, not the jalousie one.

I swapped my jalousie windows on my 73 for sliders a few years ago. I was
much happier. The louvered windows aren't supposed to be open when driving.
I know when I tried they made a heck of a racket. Maybe freshly rebuilt
they'd be quieter, but even the manual says not to do it.

To me the only real downside is a lack of a built in screen. But making
screens for them is easy, so I don't consider it an issue. (Though I still
haven't done so. heh)

It's up to you, really. Jalousies provide more airflow when open than the
sliders. But IMHO they're ugly. But if you camp a lot they might be a better
choice. I'll stick with the sliders though.
