&gt;On a serious note, I looked at my library of shop and other books last
&gt;night, and found that Haynes identifies the EGR filter in a figure as a
&gt;'carbon filter', but there was no other discussion of what was in them.  
&gt;Does that mean that it filters carbon, or that it uses carbon as the
&gt;filter medium?  I'm not sure.  All other books just call them EGR filters
&gt;and talk about replacing them every 15-30,000 miles, depending on the
&gt;model year.  So, in my mind at least, the mystery continues.

You're not alone in bafflement.  Pseudo-educated guess:  it uses carbon
(probably activated) as a filter.  But...

Does it remove carbon as well, i.e., soot from the exhaust before that
exhaust goes back into the engine?  Since it's an exhaust gas regenerator, I
assume some of the exhaust goes back into the engine.  Why it's supposed to
do this escapes me (and I've got one on my bus!)

If it removes soot, why mess with carbon filler?  It ought to use a paper
filter or some such.  If it's not for removing soot, I wonder how a little
canister can hold the effluent from 1500 gallons of gasoline and a couple
million gallons of air.

&quot;What's the EGR filter for?&quot;
&quot;Geez, doncha know anything?  It holds the carbon for filtering!&quot;

&quot;So what's the carbon for?&quot;
&quot;You idjit, it goes in the EGR filter!!&quot;  :-)
