Subject: Re: Re:Need help with possible engine purchase

Part of the appeal was that he is including all of the components, including 
part of the wiring harness from the car, but not being familiar with the 
system, I wouldn't know where to start with the loose hanging spade-ended 
wires that are supposed to connect somewhere. If I take the motor, I'll 
probably remove the D-Jet stuff as a complete unit and replace it with L-jet 
or Megasquirt as others here have suggested.

&gt; It might work in the bus, but you would have to get all of the
 components and may be a bit more challenging to maintain since parts
 (i.e. manifold vacuum sensor) might be harder to obtain than L-jet.
