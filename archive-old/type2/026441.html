Subject: New owner, advice please?

I have just purchased a 1972 VW Van for the princely sum of $200 Canadian.
It has 107K miles on it, and runs well enough (though it clearly burns oil).

Inspecting the vehicle, I noticed various rust sites, including surface
pitting on the exterior, some perforation on the floor pan (under the
passenger's feet) but the most serious rust is the track that the sliding
door runs in...it's pretty much gone.  Combined with a broken hinge atop the
door, this leaves the sliding door falling off whenever it's moved.

My question is this, what am I really in for if I choose to tackle this
rust?  Can this all be repaired without a bank loan?  I am a competent
welder, with a gas and MIG/GMAW welding unit, and I have rebuilt many
engines in the past.  Having said this, what would the value of a 72 Van be
in restored condition?....

Thanks for any advice.

John
