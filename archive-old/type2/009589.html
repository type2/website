&gt;Here I go again !
&gt;What to use !?

	Bob,
	I pick 20W-50 because I think the 20W is easy enough when
starting cold here in northern california and the 50 sure is thick 
enough even in a hard working 1600 sp. 15W-50 or 10W-40 might be a better
choice in cooler climate- if it gets below freezing much the
20W is too thick at starting. 

	Modern water cooled engines use wacky stuff like 5W-30 or 10W-30
which are good for cranking down to 4 or -13F and yet protect just like
the beloved SAE-30 at temp. If you are more worried about start-up
wear (say you stop and go a lot) you might consider 10W-30 or 10W-40.
I usually drive a long way once I've started our truck, so I worry
more about high temp and stress the high at-temp viscosity. If our
truck were an about-town vehicle 10W-40 or even 5W-30 might be the
right answer. They might anyway!

	As in all things, you pays your money and you takes your
chances. Multi-grades give you a bigger temparature 'foot print' 
but no oil is perfect. I certainly don't advocate 20W-50 as a magic elixor.
10W-40 is quite possibly better for our bus. I DO believe that better-
than-SAE 30 performance at high temperatures is a good idea for our 
aircooled engines, but I've done no scientific study to support that. 
VW was happy to recomend SAE-30 straight when these busses were new.
5W-30 might be the optimum juice for some busses.

	I just can't see a reason to NOT take advantage of multi-vis
to get either better initial pumping or additional viscosity at
temperature. As long as the changes happen often.

	Happy motoring!
	Bill
