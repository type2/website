Subject: SVDA distributor

I took apart and old beetle distributor last night for the first time and
they are remarkably simple inside. If you haven't been to Glenn Ring's
website it's worth a peek:

http://www.glenn-ring_dot_com/010/

It's very clear to me now how they wear out and how they seize/loosen up.
Until I read some Lucas articles about how these distributors actually work
I wasn't that interested in disassembly.

I have been trying to find out what exactly is inside that makes one bus
dizzy unique and it seems to be the stop plate and springs. Springs vary in
size and shape and the stop plate is Bosch numbered which makes sense but
the weights aren't so I would guess that's mostly a shared item within a
family of distributors.

Now, I'm really curious what exactly aircooled_dot_net does to that mexican unit
they sell as the SVDA.

That 043-905-205 (0 231 170 034) beetle dizzy has these spec according to
oldvolkhome_dot_com:

8-12 degrees of vac advance
7-12 degress _at_ 1600 rpm, 20-25 degrees _at_ 3800 rpm

The late bus FI requires:

8.5-11 degrees of vac advance
8-13 degrees _at_ 1600rpm, 20.5-24.5 degrees _at_ 3400 rpm

That seems so close that it's not worth performing any modification to the
mexican distributor at all it would seem, at least for the late bus
application.

Has anyone bought the beetle distributor directly from CIP1_dot_com and dropped
one into a Type 4 engine?
