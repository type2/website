Subject: Using Starter Fluid to find Vacuum Leak
Date: Sun, 10 Jun 2001 16:33:31 -0400
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Since vacuum leaks seem to be a fairly common problem, and spraying the
suspected areas with starter fluid seems to be one of the best methods of
detection, I would like to ask the following question:  Realizing that
starter fluid is extremely volatile, has anyone had a problem with starter
fluid exploding or causing a fire when using it to test for vacuum leaks?  I
have read here on the list that WD-40 can be used, but starter fluid seems
to be the favorite choice for vacuum leak  detection so I am just trying to
determine how volatile it really is and whether I can feel fairly safe using
it.  I know about all the warnings etc, just wondering if it has actually
caused a fire in the engine compartment for anyone?  Thanks.
