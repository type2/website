Subject: I need a 68-79 Bus!

Hello everyone!

Does anyone know of a 1968- 1979 Bus for sale with a good to excellent drive 
train for less than $1000?  I'd prefer a carb engine but any will do.
I'm really just in need of the engine, trans, and mounting hardware - not the 
whole bus so obviously the interior and body condition is of no concern to 
me.  BTW, I'm in Tampa Florida so it would have to be something that could be 
driven to my home.
Thanks!

Dave
