Subject: RE: [T2] Not White Hubcaps - grey

I was in a boneyard in Eastern NC and spoted a camper with painted
hubcaps. They looked white to me.

I was wrong...the original hubcaps on my '70 ASI/Riviera pop top camper
were
not white, as I thought.  They - according to closer inspection of
original
brochures - were a light grey color.  Anyone seen these around, either
on
someone's camper or else sold somewhere?
