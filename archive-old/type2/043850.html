Hi Chad
Sounds like something's acting like a check valve in the system.  If you had 
the same problem with both old and new flexi lines and wheel cylinders, the 
trouble's gotta be uphill from that.  I assume your left front works fine so 
I'd almost betcha the trouble is between the flexi line and the 'tee' where 
the front lines join (maybe at the master?).  I didn't look at your master 
cylinder so I can't say...

Maybe loosen the line at the master cylinder and give it a gentle pump to 
see if a chunk o'dookie comes out.

Dave

&quot;The question is, said Alice, whether words can mean so many things&quot;
