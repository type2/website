Subject: rear shock absorber removal



&gt; The upper bolt attaching the right rear shock is turning loosely and
&gt; will not come out. I tried to find the other end of the bolt, figuring
&gt; there'd be a nut I could put a wrench on, but I haven't been able to
&gt; locate it. The bolt seems to go into the side of the wheel well
&gt; approximately where the gas tank is located. Does anyone know how to get
&gt; at the other end of the bolt? Do I have to take the gas tank out?

There is a weld-nut located right behind the gas tank panel. You will need
to remove the panel. You will have enough room at the end of the gas tank
for a pair of vise grips to hold the turning weld-nut. Not sure how you
would replace it. You could use a regular nut but the next time the shocks
were replaced, the panel would have to be removed.
