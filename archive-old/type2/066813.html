I've flashed brights by accident a few times, when intending to turn 
lights off, and everytime, the truck has QUICKLY backed off from 
making the lane change.  Been THAT way for me for 20+ years, too!
Interesting, and the reason for this thread!  Difficult to make this 
particular mistake in a VW, BTW due to the independent switches for 
headlights and bright lights.  On my Subaru with the single stalk for 
both, this error mode is easier to perform. 8-(

I would rather you vote against me than not vote at all.
Get out and VOTE on November 5th (USA folks that is !)

&gt; Wow, the idea of flashing your high-beams to tell them it's not safe to pass
&gt; is pretty scary, since for as long as I've driven, I've always understood
&gt; that this is a signal to say it is safe.  I only do this to big trucks
&gt; (and they often give nice signals back) and I presumed I was correct.  The
&gt; trucks need the flash because it is real hard to estimate the position of the
&gt; end of one of those triple-trailer beasts they drive out west here.  I'd sure
&gt; hate to signal them it was safe when it wasn't!
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe I've been wrong for twenty years.

malcolm, private post me, I can't seem to figure out your email 
address.
