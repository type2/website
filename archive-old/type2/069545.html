Subject: Good GEX rebuild  

I feel soooo lonely. I have often thought that I must be the only happy
owner of a GEX rebuilt engine on the list. I have a GEX rebuilt '78 2L
long block, and it has been a happy puppy for 30K mi. and is now on its
third body in those 30K miles (Please don't ask why).  It has been the
best kind of engine there is, completely unexceptional.  The only regret I
had was that I did not buy the extended warantee, tho now (since it would
have expired unused {I think it was an extra 20k/2years} I feel better
about that.

It is the only rebuilt I have ever bought and thus my statistical universe
is very small, but after pricing parts, and knowing the hours of labor
that go into a good rebuild, I decided on buying rather than rebuilding.
For those who started on 12 and 1600 engines the sticker shock factor for
T4 engine parts is rather overwhelming.  In addition, at the time my
original engine packed it in (at 150K mi) I was only a few weeks away from
a cross country trip, and in the middle of rehabbing a house so there was
simply no time.

I have been quiet on this because of my small experience, but if we are
going to do a good engine/bad engine poll, will the keeper of the poll put
one &quot;good&quot; check next to GEX?
