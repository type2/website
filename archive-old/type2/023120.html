Subject: hmm...now what?!
Mime-Version: 1.0

okay...here' the situation (several questions):

1975 van w/ 1978 engine
single carb./dual port retro fitted
electronic fuel pump

now, this weekend, i took of my carburetor to clean it up.  i still don't 
know what brand it is, but from the responses i received...joe blow carb.

the bus tends to run a bit rough AND if you hit the throttle fast and hard 
it wants to die.  slow and smooth...no problem.  so, i guess my automatic 
choke isn't working (or vacuum advance?).  there is an electrical gizmo in 
the auto choke that is supposed to heat the area/coil, but i don't know if 
it is working.

so, the engine was originally fuel injected?  now it has a single carb. w/ 
elec. fuel pump.  in this whole process, i replaced all of my fuel lines 
and a few vacuum hoses.

main fuel line to fuel filter to fuel pump to carb. (no problem)
i found a fuel line from the tank into the engine compartment where it was 
&quot;plugged.&quot;  so, is this for back pressure?  if this is true, shouldn't my 
electric fuel pump regulate my pressure, eliminating the need for this line 
and a pressure regulator, right?!

so, how do i properly plug this line to the tank?  if i DO need a pressure 
regulator, what kind and where?

the madness continues: i have no EGR valve.  so, from my research, there 
are two egr from the FI years: mechanical and electric.  i don't think i'll 
pass VA emissions without it.  so, which one should i use (if i can snag 
one off a bus in a junkyard)....considering this was once a FI engine w/ 
single carb.?

argh, it was a late night last night, and the bus was in the driveway...in 
the cold.  i am just happy that the fuel lines are now replaced...but the 
plugged line still worries me too.

thanks in advance...and sorry this is soooo long.

missy:)
