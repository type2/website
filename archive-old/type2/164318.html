Thanks Karl. That is what Busdepot discussed on the phone. FWIW, according
to their drawings, which I would assume originated at VW, the block doesn't
appear on the 80-81 aircooled engines.

It just now occurred to me that perhaps the phonelic block is reusable, with
paper gaskets on each side? In and of itself, it sure is not going to seal
much, yet there was nothing on my engine, except the block, no paper, no
residue, or anything like that.

If it also requires the paper gaskets, where do you reckon them come from? I
guess I will find out if what is in the kit, is the gaskets, and I have to
use the block that came out?

Time will tell, but I do appreciate you explaining things.

Thanks,

John
