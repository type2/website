Hi,
	VW changed the calipers in '72- the later ones can use thicker pads,
which
take longer to wear out.
 
The changeover date was August '72 ('73 Model year?).

 I *think* that you can use both the '77 calipers on a '72 axle. I certainly
wouldn't want to use one of each, but IIRC the mountings are the same. Check
the discs carefully- again, I think you will need to use either the '77
discs
with the '77 calipers or the '72 d+c combination, not mix 'n' match.

 BTW: Surely you mean &quot;Bleed Nipple&quot; not &quot;grease nozzle&quot;...

Cheers,
	W.
