Subject: The Times They are A changin

Ronnie Said:

&gt;&gt;things continue to go on our buses seem to be taken over by the computer
&gt;&gt;geek

Daniel:
&gt;I take offense to that since i'm a computer programmer BUT NOT A COMPUTER
&gt;GEEK. If i was a true geek i would be making enough dough to buy a 23
window, but
&gt;no here i sit in my 1300 71 Westy.

I agree with Daniel, The real Geeks have the slammed 55 westies. I also work
on my
laptop - but I prefer to sit surrounded by cases and heads in my garage with
the rich smell
of old transmission fluid wafting in the air, I usually only sit in the bus
for conference calls
or to drive to the airport. My computer job allows me to afford my $500 72
rust rocket, which I had
to replace the drive train on - hardly geek material!!!
