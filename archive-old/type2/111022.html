&gt; On my 1970, the two hoses that run from fan shroud to heat exchangers each got

Do you have the little collars that go from the rear heat exchangers (the
ones attached to the muffler) up through the tin?  The paper hoses aren't
supposed to go through the tin at all.  There is a rubber seal that goes
around the collar, and the paper hose sits on top of the seal.

&gt; BTW, I spent the Saturday doing some stuff to my bus, one thing was replacing
&gt; my crankshaft pulley with a nice new SCAT degree pulley. To get to the
&gt; crankshaft nut I had to remove my exhaust system because one of the pipes
&gt; blocked my way.

Hmmm, this gives me the idea that you have an aftermarket exhaust that
doesn't have the rear heat exchangers.  In that case, the above
explanation probably doesn't apply (or even make sense)
