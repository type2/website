&gt;OK,,bought the new glove box (plastic one) to replace
&gt;the broken-up original cardboard one....
&gt;
&gt;my question is, how do you install the thing??/
&gt;
&gt;ive taken the glove box door off but it doesnt want to
&gt;gently slide into place....and if you remove the metal
&gt;strap and silde it under the dash it doesnt seem to
&gt;fit either

If it's exactly the same shape as the original it will install from the bottom (remove the strap etc). The cardboard one will brush up against the plastic air ducts and seem not to want to go in but it does without deforming.
