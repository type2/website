Subject: RE: [T2] hub caps

&gt; Uncanny timing for this thread!  Coincidentally, I happen to
&gt; have 5 sets of OEM German chrome hubcaps on their way to me
&gt; from Germany as I write this. ...
&gt;
&gt; The listmember price is $179.95 per set of 4 - which works
&gt; out to $44.99 each.
&gt;
&gt; http://busdepot_dot_com/details.jsp?partnumber=SP3



Following up  ... The hubcaps arrived yesterday, and it turns out they are
not just OEM but actually Volkswagen brand.  Packed 4 to a box in genuine VW
boxes, with the Volkswagen part number and &quot;Made in Germany&quot; right on the
box.

At this point I believe I have 2 sets left. (Use the above link to order.)
