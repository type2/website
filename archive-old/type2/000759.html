&gt; I have been using the cheap oil filters
&gt;  After joining this List this summer I
&gt; have become sort of paranoid as to
 &gt; what should be used in a Vanagon.
&gt; Which is better, and why?


This has been covered extensively in the Vanagon list archives and also on
this list, but to summarize:

Vanagon oil filters by design have a different pressure and flow
characteristics than those used on Golfs, Rabbits, etc.  Most aftermarket
filters use the same &quot;generic&quot; design for both, and this can damage your
engine, plain and simple. According to Mahle/Germany, the original oil
filter (and piston, cylinder, etc.) supplier to VW, &quot;When you use (a Golf
oil filter) for your car (VW Tranporter/Vanagon) you can get problems, when
you start your car. The motor is too ong without oil...and the pressure
bypass is different. Please use (the correct Vanagon-specific filter) to get
no damage to your car or motor.&quot;  This is right from the horse's mouth, so
to speak.  I have also seen proof of it with my own eyes (and ears):
vehicles with lifter noise or even severe knocking on start-up, that went
away immediately when the correct filter was installed.  Even if the
situation is not so severe that it causes a knock in your engine, it can
certainly be harmful to your engine in the long run.

Only two filters, to my knowledge, are specifically designed for the
Transporter/Vanagon engine, with the correct characteristics that Mahle
speaks of.  One is the Mahle (also sold under the Knecht name), the other
Mann (also an O.E. supplier to VW).  Bosch is sometimes but not always
comparable to the above two brands. In some markets, they are selling a good
German filter (probably in fact made by Mahle or Mann).  In others they are
simply repackaging some U.S. made filter, whose origin cannot be confirmed.
(Therefore I don't sell them, given the good availability of actual Mahle
and Mann filters which are always the same.)

This means that if you want to be sure of preventing damage to your engine,
you should stick with either Mahle/Knecht, Mann, or the VW brand sold by the
VW dealer (which is generally either a relabeled Mahle or Mann).

These filters do not cost $9.00 as one list member has suggested.  I sell
them for $3.99 to $4.29 apiece, depending on the application.  In my opinion
this is a no-brainer.  It's kind of silly to even take the risk of buying a
filter that can potentially damage a $2000 engine, just so you can save
perhaps one dollar on an oil filter.
