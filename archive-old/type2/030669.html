Hello all!!
	I am looking for an engine and some knowlege of my engine for my '79 T2.  I
would like an engine to rebuild and eventually install.  I want to learn about
the internals of the engine, and the best way to do that for me is to do a
rebuild.  My father says it would be advisable to uses a &quot;big bore&quot; kit.   Is
that advisable??  
	Anyways, if you have a lead on a buildable engine, lemmee know.

Drew, 
Sacramento.

&gt; Hey Jamie...
&gt; 
&gt; I'm still having problems setting my electric choke on my 34 pict 3.

I just did mine today and it seems to be working well, but the real
test will be on monday, when I get up to go to work at 5:00AM!!! It's
been getting down to the low teens here at night, so hopefully.....

&gt; Evidently, the marks that are supposed to line up on the bimetal
element and
&gt; the choke housing doesn't hold a lot of weight... At least that's
what I've
&gt; found.  

I don't believe these lines exist on the 30/31. At least, this is the
first I've heard of it;-)

&gt;Although, on my 28 pict 1, the electric choke works quite well, and
&gt; the settings are very similar....  Go figure...

Here's what I did: 

1-Put the choke solenoid in place, but not closing the butterfly at
all. 
2-Tightened the 3 screws that hold the solenoid until I could just
barely turn the solenoid.
3-Turn the solenoid until it begins closing the butterfly. Now here's
the fun part; you have to try and guess just how far the choke would
be closed at the current temperature outside. I started at about 1/4
closed and started the motor. Not enough. Reset it at about 1/3 and it
seemed fine, so I tightened the screws up *not too tight*.

I let it sit for a couple of hours and then went out to dinner. It ran
better than it has in a LONG time. It sat outside in the cold for
another couple of hours while we ate, came out, fired it up and pulled
away in less than a minute!!!! PLENTY of power and NO SPUTTERING!!!!

I still need to check it on a truly cold morning and also check that
it shuts off completely when fully warm, but I feel pretty good about
it.

Other things to check...

~make sure the little lever-arm that connects the choke-solenoid coil
to the butterfly-valve is, in fact, connected to the solenoid-coil
properly;-) and that it moves freely.
~make sure the throttle-valve stop screw is resting on the highest
&quot;step&quot; of the throttle valve plate before you adjust the choke.
Otherwise, the butterfly valve will only close so far and you won't be
able to adjust the choke properly. Don't mess with the screw, though!
If this makes no sense to you, look at diagram 5-10, (page 14, section
3) of the Bentley manual. 

If you still have no idea what I'm saying, write me back and I'll try
again. If you don't have the Bentley, maybe I can scan the photo so
you can see it.

A BIG THANK YOU!!! To everyone who wrote me on this and offered
advice! I kind of took all the advice and combined it and it worked.


Jaime

&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone &quot;successfuly&quot; installed and adjusted an &quot;auto-choke&quot; on a
&gt; 30/31 pict carb?
&gt; 
&gt; Also, I've come to believe that my fuel shut-off solenoid may be
&gt; faulty. Anyone know the signs?
&gt; 
&gt; Stalling at idle is one big clue to a faulty solenoid (could also
mean a
&gt; vacuum leak, etc...)  The check method is to pull the solenoid,
ground the
&gt; body against the engine, turn the ignition to the on position, and
touch the
&gt; wire lead to the male adaptor on the end of the solenoid.  The plunger
&gt; should move in and out as it receives electricity...  This won't
work if the
&gt; solenoid isn't grounded correctly, which it normally is by being
screwed
&gt; into the body of the carb....
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I know this carb sucks and that the auto-choke is not very popular
&gt; (per MUIR and his disciples), but I need them both right now.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Good luck...
&gt;

Hi - my brother and his wife will be in the UK in the last week of March,
and want to buy a reliable camper to tour UK and Europe in.  Their budget
is limited, so I guess they are looking for an older Bay not cosmetically
perfect!

Any leads appreciated.
