&gt; I'd agree with some of the other posters, a timeing light is nice, but for
&gt; an upright you can do just fine with a homemade bulb tester and a set of
&gt; feeler gauges. Save the money for quality handtools that wont shear off
&gt; bolts or break in your hands.

99% true, but on my '71 with dual vacuum distributor I found that the
timing light yielded better results.  I can get it pretty close with
static timing, but I always check it with the light.

The light is also the only way to check the full advance value.
