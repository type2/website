Dear Group

Rented the movie &quot;Absolute Power&quot; the other night, and towards the end of 
the movie, when Clint Eastwood parks the car at the hospital in the 
background is a Green and White Split Window bus .........Cool!  Just get 
to see the front and some of the right side.  Sorry if this has already 
been mentioned, I'm new to the list.  :)

Also, (more Friday fluff), I'm VP of the local VW club in Springfield,
