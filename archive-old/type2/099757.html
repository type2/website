&gt;I seem to recall that someone posted awhile back that there is an

That was me.  When I replaced the sender in my '73 with a new one (from the VW dealer I might add) I experienced the same symptoms as Richard.  I was able to solve the problem with the adjustment and now my gauge reads from just above the full mark to the bottom of the reserve mark.  It is a very small screw not much bigger than an eyeglass screw on the small box that is attached to the back of the fuel gauge.  Not all of these boxes seem to have the adjustment.  If there is enough interest, I suppose I could try and post a picture of this screw.
