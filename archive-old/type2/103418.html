&gt; Jason, you didn't take into account that your gonna be dealing with

&gt; engines, like small outboard motors, are very barometrically sensitive. Just 
&gt; ask any of the other mid-eastern seaboard folks on the list. They'll in all 
&gt; likelihood confirm this. 

confirmed, and I'm further North in Maryland, the 90/90s we sometimes call
it, days over 90 degrees with 90% humidity....the times when I wish I had
fixed rather than removed the AC that was in my bus when got it, did get a
dashboard fan though
