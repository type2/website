&gt; This is long:
&gt;
&gt; Ok.. here's where I'd stop and do some MAJOR sanity checks.  Looks like
&gt; fuel is a problem, however, I'd still verify that spark is working
&gt; correctly.

deleting great step by step that I will save for future etc.
&gt;
&gt; Hook up timing light again, make sure every wire is triggering a spark.

yup

&gt;   Sanity check here.
&gt;
&gt; Ok, now, here is where I'd really determine that we have spark and
&gt; compression.  I'd spray a short puff of starting fluid in the intake and
&gt; see if it starts.  It should just run briefly and die.  I'd probably do

and it did, in fact ran a lot longer that it should on just the short shot
of starting fluid I used.

&gt; this a few times just to make me feel good that everything's running ok.
&gt;   If it doesn't kick over, then let us know.

did this

&gt;
&gt; Next I'd probably hook up the injectors, leaving off the cold-start for
&gt; the time being (don't need too much extra fuel) and try a couple times
&gt; watching the fuel pressure.  Does it kick at all?  If the pressure
&gt; doesn't hold, then I'd wonder if an injector is getting stuck open so

yup, goes to 30+ and holds

&gt; I'd probably crank a couple times and then watch the pressure and make
&gt; sure it holds.  It should at least kick by now.. if not, let us know.  I
&gt; can't really think of anything else offhand.. if I do, I'll letcha know!

try a few more times, with a short 1/4 second puff of starting fluid and
finally she fires and runs.... grab timing light and start trying to get
timing right on, it is.  running smooth..... then stops (after about 5
minutes) and it will not restart even with fluid....

??? intermittent electrical problem????  I wasn't even touching the engine
when it stopped, just listening to it run and trying to determine what was
what.   it never did more than idle, could not get it to rev up at all??/


got it on the charger while I mumble to myself and to the german auto
dieties

thanks for the guide. will print this out, had already did all but one or
two steps.  cold start valve is installed but not plugged in

got a small oil leak, later

now what???? (retorical question)

am on a different checked out AFM
using a diffirent brain box.
using stock points/condenser/rotor etc

really baffled

some history that may or may not even be relavant, when I was coming back
from Everybus the bus started to slowly lose power. by the time I hit the
NC-VA line I couldn't get over 55mph, by Richmond it was down to about
45mph and by the time I got to the MD-VA line it was 20mph  barely got
over the hump on the rt 301 bridge over the potomac river. called it
quits in LaPlata MD, wrote this off as the sunken valve seat but now I
wonder...???
