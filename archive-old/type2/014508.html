Hello all,
I have not been on the list much the past year or so, due to work and other
hobbies.  Which brings me to my post today.  I went out to my garage and
made a list of all the Type IV stuff I need to sell.  Basically I am
cleaning out everything Type IV related, and focusing on one or two hobbies
so as to not get so worn thin with projects.  You know what I mean?  So here
goes, I will list items and give descriptions where needed.

1972 Westy pop-top
-with upper cot, childs cot, and step stool
-van has around 86K original (a title search will verify this)
-the camper was purchased over 2 1/2 years ago, with a bad piston, I 
started the rebuild, but have yet to assemble the motor.  It is an  
 early 72 with the small push rod tubes.
-van has slight body damage when previous owner had someone tap him in  the
rear corner.  Van had NOT been wrecked beyond that.  Van in not   rotting
away, and is NOT hacked up.  
-cabinets, etc, are intacted not destoyed or *modified*
-previous owner spent about $500 at midas to do a complete brake job  front
to rear about one year before I purchased it.
-engine and VIN MATCH!!!

CB037629 This is the motor from the above westy.  Motor is completely 
disassembled.  
-I have ALL the parts to make it turn-key, shoud, alt, carbs, etc.
-heads have been bead blasted and come with all new springs,  retainers,
valves.  Have not been installed.

AW009777 This is a second motor I purchased from a local VW  mechanic.  My
intent was to use it for parts when needed. It is partially   disassembled
as well, but all parts have been kept together. (heads   to crank) 

W0093596  This motor is turn-key.  You add the  carb-set-up of  your 
choice. 
-has EVERYTHING...muffler, boxes, all shroud pieces, clutch, flywheel.
-I used this motor in the 72 westy, I put on dual solex 32 pdsit's and  it
runs beautiful!! 
-it is originally from a 411 with fuel injection, more HP, higher   
compression, I adjusted timing accordingly and had ZERO problems.

1- complete turn-key 1974 Subaru motor, minus carb.  You add carb   set-up
of your choice.  Complete with flywheel, clutch, water pump,   etc.  Taken
from an old sand rail.
-1600 cc.  push rod.

1-bosch AFM #280 200 006 with air filter box, complete.
1-set 411 heater boxes to go with the W0093596 motor.  Excellent    shape.
1-set type IV bus htr boxes, decent shape.
2-sets type I bug htr boxes (need cleaned up)
2-front brake rotors from a 73 vw van.  No grooves or metal on metal   wear.
1-type IV bugpack header.  Used less than 100 miles.  Painted it with 
 high temp paint before using it.
1-type IV bugpack muffler.  Goes on above mentioned header.  
2-complete bead blasted 1700 Type IV heads, new valves, springs, etc,  never
run, they go with the 1700 motor in the 72 westy listed above.
1-COMPLETE solex 32 PDSIT set-up.  Complete.._dot_carbs, linkage, air  
filter,manifolds.  These were used on the 411 motor.
1-complete  crank-out jalousie window, including mounting screws and  
rubber seal.  Glass NOT broken, aluminum is NOT corroded, stored   inside.
1- 2 Barrel weber w/ manifold, and air cleaner.
1- 2 barrel weber NO manifold.

Also included in this clean-up sale, (all type IV items)...alternators, misc
carbs (32 solex's), all shroud tin for above motors, extra mufflers, cranks,
rods, heads, gauges (temp, volt, amp, with senders), distributors, engine
seals, booster fans, heater hoses, oil coolers, ANYTHING I can find type IV
related is included.  I am only keeping a very small amount of type I bug
items.  All above mentioned parts have NEVER been outside, with the
exception of the 72 westy.  All items in shop.

Asking $1200 for the lot.  I live in Omaha, NE. Will even assist in
delivery, with in reason.  I have a large trailer/pick-up I could tow the
westy and load the truck with all the parts.  Possibly to the Denver,
Minneapolis, St.Louis, K.C. areas, or meet someone 1/2 way.

Should have photos next week for those interested.

So you get a westy with a 411 motor to bolt in, and drive away, with enough
parts to build two more engines (including the original one for the 72) and
a sooby motor for your buggy, with parts galore.

I need to consolidate, and would like someone to be able to use these parts.
