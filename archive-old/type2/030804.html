Subject: needed:  front beam for 77 bus
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.GSO.4.10.9906251057360.12840-100000_at_ux8.cso.uiuc_dot_edu&gt;

a friend of mine here has a 77 bus (matilda) that is in need of a new
front beam.  he's had several people look at it and the prognosis is not
good.  prefer to find one in the neighboring areas (central illinois,
western indiana)  

any help is appreicated.

the story of the bus is located at:
