Subject: Adding gages

I have a 1978 ASI/Riviera Camperbus 2L (2000cc) Fuel Injected VW.
 
I am interesting in putting in an Oil Gage and a Tachometer and possibly a
voltage gage.  These would be just so I can monitor whats going behind me so
I do not have to totally rely on my nose and butt (vibrations) and rear view
mirror to let me know something's up.
 
I am planning on pulling the engine at the end of summer to do all of this,
just want to know what I need to have/get to make all of this happen.
 
Thanks.
