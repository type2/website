Last I heard TN does not require anything....

I like lack of government let me tell you BUT maybe this is an area that 
needs attention.

&gt;sorry to hear about the damage to your bus.  believe me i know where you are
&gt;coming from!
&gt;
&gt;no insurance, eh?  check your local laws. it's illegal to operate a motor
&gt;vehicle here in NC w/o insurance &amp; i imagine most states are the same?


Sorry to hear about two VW wrecks in such a short time.

Chris
