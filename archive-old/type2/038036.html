There is a little &quot;B&quot; that is back lit on my dash, this is a familiar site
to me, since my Beetle had it. However, it's never lit before, I had always
assumed it had something to do with brakes, and with that assumption figured
it was supposed to light when the emergency brake was activated.  However,
now it will light whenever I hit the brakes, which it didn't for the last
3-4K miles?  Rumor is it means my brakes aren't all giving the same
pressure?  Any truth to that rumor?
