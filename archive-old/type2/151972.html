&gt; Thanks for the reply and the welcome.......
&gt;
&gt; My intial thoughts were wrong and I am now even more confused.
&gt;
&gt; 1) The online diagram seems to differ from the 'Offical service
&gt; manual' in that the black 12v feed is from track E (online) and F in
&gt; the manual?
&gt; 2) Either way be it F or E they both come from the ignition and not
&gt; the alternator....my mistake....

basically the same, that is still the 12v power feed.

&gt; 3) So.....is the 12v feed to the blower swtich simply a junction  from
&gt; the ignition to coil? If not why are both needed? Do I not just need a
&gt; ignition on 12v feed?

blower won't run down your battery when parked I guess...
right you need the ignition 12v feed.  (I don't even have the blower and
that's the way mine is run)
