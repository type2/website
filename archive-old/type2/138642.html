&gt;From: Access Systems

&gt;it was in effect &quot;Drafting&quot; that big box, road rock steady, even over the
&gt;&quot;Harry Nice&quot; bridge over the Potomac river where the wind blows pretty
&gt;stiffly.


Good to know I will be crossing the Mississippi pretty high up, better check 
my wind sock before I cross. ;)
