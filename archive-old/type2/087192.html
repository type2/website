Subject: Re: [T2] air conditioning

David,

Worked at VPC in Ft. Worth(vwoa subsidiary) for a couple of 
years....didn't design the bus unit.

I suspect that if you get a rotary compressor, and one of the list 
suppliers has them, you should do just fine.  I intend to use one on my 78 
when i get ready to bring the a/c back from the dead.....and I bet I don't 
have to cut the shiny new sheet metal/body work that I am just getting 
ready to cover up my old a/c compressor hole spot with.


Electric roof unit is out...more amperage required at 12v than is 
available in the universe(jut kidding, but it is bad)....and you would
have three energy conversions going on there.

mechanical--&gt;electrical--&gt;mechanical
engine    --&gt;alternator--&gt;a/c compressor

Any engineer worth his/her salt will tell you that you are going to loose 
about 20% of your energy on each conversion....

Godd luck, dave

&gt; read through through the archives which say 1) you may never get a good seal

&gt; the dash kind never worked that good in the first place 4) goodbye
&gt; horsepower.
&gt; 
&gt; After all this reading, what I saw at the boneyard didn't impress me either,
&gt; however, someone had a VW page on the web with a good, as yet unexplored,
&gt; idea: put a quality rooftop unit on the luggage rack of a westy.
&gt; 
&gt; This seems to have some obvious advantages:
&gt; 
&gt; - electrically driven.  It would be easy to get the heavy wiring to the
&gt; engine compartment but maybe this extra load is too much for a 70A
&gt; alternator.  What is the nominal current draw while driving?
&gt; 
&gt; - Large amounts of cool air right in the cab and rearward.
&gt; 
&gt; - Mostly non-invasive except for a hole in the roof.
&gt; 
&gt; The disadvantages:
&gt; 
&gt; - possible vibration right over head.
&gt; 
&gt; - cost?
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone contemplated doing this or attempted it?
