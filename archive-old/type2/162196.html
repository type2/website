Subject: Re: [T2] Anyone using a Battery Minder

&gt;I have some concerns about the battery life over the winter hibernation
&gt;and have had thoughts of investing in a Battery Minder.

AGM batteries (like Optima) discharge slower than traditional batteries. One of their many benefits...

&gt;Anyone opinions on these devices?  I searched the archives and didn't
&gt;get any hits.
&gt;
&gt;One of the questions I have when using such a Battery
&gt;Charger/conditioner is can you simply hook up while the battery is still
&gt;in the bus and connected to the electrical system?

Yes. Check out &lt;http://www.batterytender_dot_com/&gt;.

Before switching to AGM, I use to used their motorcycle class battery tender plus because I already owned one:

It takes a bit longer to charge a car battery but they have other models.
