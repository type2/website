I purchased my new arms from a mechanic here on the list &quot;orangevw&quot; 
aka Bob  (orangevw_at_email.msn_dot_com).  Listen guys .... he is the best 
person to do business with, reasonable and honest.  If I didn't live 
on the other side os the US, he would be the only person that I would 
take my bus to.  Customer service is #1, and that is VERY hard to 
find&quot;

I just wanted to second that sentiment.  Bob shipped me a used 
steering box, which turned out to be bad, so he got it picked up and 
sold me a busboys rebuild at his wholesale cost.  Very apologetic. 
I'm sure he lost shipping dollars on the deal , too.  Shipped 
everything before getting my check.  Trust, remember that?  Thanks 
Bob!  My bus steers like a slot car racer now!
