Subject: Re: [T2] Timing for 009 Distributor?

&gt; Just upgraded to a 009 Distributor and Pertronix Ignitor (Part Number 1847V) on my '71.  Stock engine.  Still had the original Bosch distributor with points.  Timing for that was 5 degrees ATDC at idle.  Was told that it's 7 degrees BTDC at idle for the new arrangement.  Sound right?  Have a fairly new &quot;Made in Mexico&quot; coil.  Seems to be running okay.  May upgrade to the Bosch blue coil if needed.  Any recommendations?  Thx.
&gt;
I just changed my 009 and pertronix (because I broke the magnet assy) to a
vac dizzy and points. I did like the pertronix but dont know if Im
prepared to shell out that much for another. It really hass more hop
with the vac dizzy.
The timing should be around 7.5 BTDC but use a timing light and make sure
its around 28 (could go to 30 prob but mine is 28) at full advance which
may set youre idle advance anywhere from 7.5-10-13 or so depending on the
009. I also run a Universal tiger CDI and have a blue coil btw. I really
like the cdi.
