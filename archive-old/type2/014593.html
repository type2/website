Subject: Help '79 bus backfires / won't start.

Help! My '79 bus is making me crazy.

Background info:   2.0 L fuel injected engine.  Underwent and complete (and
expensive) rebuild less than 50K miles ago.  Several weeks ago the bus died
while traveling down the interstate.  After much investigation I discovered
that the Cam gear was shattered into several pieces.  (I had never seen this
happen but the guy at Mark Stephens said they had seen several cases this
year-  Bad Cam gears?)  Anyway, I tore down the engine and replaced the
bearings and of course the cam gear.  The heads and pistons looked good so I
simply installed them again with a new gasket set of course.  Bear in mind
that until the bus died on the interstate it had been in perfect running
order.   I was really happy in fact to see just how CLEAN the engine was when
I disassembled it.

The Problem:   After reinstalling the engine in the bus it will not start!  It
will occasionally produce a loud backfire but no attempt to start.   The only
time I have heard backfiring on starting like that is when spark plug wires
are put onto the wrong cylinders.  (Their not I checked)   

What I have checked so far:  Timing is set. Plug wires on the right
sparkplugs.  Fuel pump is new and pumping.  Coil is producing good spark.
Spark plugs are getting spark.  CHT sensor is new and functioning properly.
All vacuum hoses are in place.  All grounds for fuel injection in place.
Injectors firing.

I am out of Ideas and I really miss the Busted bus Pages!!!!   Thanks in
advance for your help!

Don
