&gt; Subject: wiring questions???

&gt; Here's one I hope someone can help me out with.  I have a '63
&gt; kombi that was mostly complete when I got it.  However a few
&gt; things were missing, one of which was the starter.  I'll be
&gt; buying a new one this weekend and just need to figure out where
&gt; the wires hook up to it.  When I look at the space where it goes,
&gt; there's a small box mounted above where the starter goes with
&gt; three wires coming out of it.  Two are black and one is red.  one

Generally at the starter, the connections are:

Circuit 30:  1) Red---to fuse box/light switch/ignition switch
             2) Red/Black--to voltage regulator
             3) Black---to battery positive
Circuit 50:  1) Red--to ignition switch

Also, generally, circuit 30 is the &quot;bolt-on&quot; and circuit 50
is the &quot;push on&quot; type.

&gt; of the black ones has a push on connector and the other black
&gt; wire and the red one have the round type connectors that go over
&gt; a bolt.  Basically, I'd just like to know what the box is and

I will admit to being confused about what the &quot;box&quot; is as well.
Is there some &quot;custom&quot; wiring in place?  I have 5 examples in my
sheds, all have a grommet for the wire to the battery and the
rest of the wires go into the harness which exits the frame near
the starter--no box.  Granted, someone may have installed new
wire with non-stock color insulation.  Also granted, mine are '66
and '67, but the VW wiring diagrams for '63 show a similar setup
for that year.  Given early VW engineering, the two round
connectors get bolted on, the push-on gets pushed on and there's
little room for confusion unless someone (euphamistically)
re-engineers it.

&gt; where the three wires hook up.  If no one knows, I'm sure I can
&gt; figure it out, but I thought it would be easier to ask.  Also,
&gt; where does the positive wire from the battery go- to the starter
&gt; or the solenoid?

Wait a minute, isn't the solenoid bolted to the starter motor
with the &quot;bolt&quot; connections on the solenoid itself?  There's
*some* room for variation since the wire from circuit 30 on the
solenoid goes to the regulator, some wiring I've seen have two
wires from the + terminal at the battery (one to
starter/solenoid, the other directly to the regulator) which
bypasses the connection at the starter.  Beyond that, I don't see
much room for &quot;improvement&quot; except for those who add a relay near
the starter to cut down on power loss to the front of the bus
(and back).  That may be the reason for &quot;the box.&quot;
