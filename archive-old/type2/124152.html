Subject: Re: [T2] It just died

Oliver:

You're going about it all wrong.  If you're using pure guesswork to
&quot;eliminate&quot; things then the expense of the cure is inversely proportional to
your luck.

An engine needs 3 things to run: sufficient compression, the right ratio of
fuel/air, and spark - at the correct time.

What are you lacking?  Having decided which one of the 3 things is lacking,
you then start *testing* components of the system involved.  Since you
didn't mention hearing any expen$ive noises in the engine (and the engine
*does* turn over, right?) then presumably the fault lies in the ignition or
FI system.  Each one of these systems is susceptible to component testing to
tell you more precisely where the problem's at.

&gt; I was humming along at 70, as usual, and the bus just died. No noises.
&gt; Nuffin'! Just two red idiot lights on the dash. I had it flatbedded home.
So
&gt; far, I've changed the fuel filter and fuel pump. Where do I go next?
Double
&gt; relay? Pressure regualtor? Any adivice would be most welcome. This process
&gt; of elimination crapola is getting expensive. Thanx.
