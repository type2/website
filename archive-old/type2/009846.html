Subject: Type IV cases - alligator skin
Message-Id: &lt;199906151428.HAA13506_at_helix.ucsd_dot_edu&gt;

I have noticed that a lot of the aluminum Type IV cases have the 
appearance of alligator skin on the castings (or orange peel turned 
inside-out) while others look like clean castings. What does this mean? 
Is it a sign of a weakened case? Or was there a lack of quality control 
at the foundry that is basically meaningless?
