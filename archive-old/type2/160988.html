Subject: Re: [T2] Brake servo hose for '71 Bus w/disc brakes

Try here for the original hose

  Look under Brake Hydraulic Parts.  Part number is N 20390.12  Hose - High Pressure Rated For Servo Vacuum, Bus/Pickup/Vanagon 71-91 . It's not cheap but it is the OG stuff. Hope this helps

  Greetings, &amp; attention Bus Parts Gurus!

I was crawling about under the Bus tonight, &amp; found that the hose from
the rigid line where it terminates just short of the front beam to the
fitting on the servo is tired, &amp; crumbling at the servo end. I was able
to trim it back about 1/2' &amp; clamp it to the fitting.

I got the Bus with the brake servo hose disconnected in the engine
compartment, reason unknown. It had been that way all the time the PO
had owned it.

So I don't know if the hose was disconnected in the rear because the
hose up front was leaking vacuum, or because the servo was out, or
because someone lost the short hose from check valve to intake manifold
while changing the engine, &amp; didn't think it was important. I think all
are possibilities.

The Bus is still up on jack stands in my garage, so I can't test the
servo right now. I hope to get it on the ground &amp; out of the shop in the
nest few days, so I can run it with the servo connected, to find out if
I need a new one.

At any rate, I'll be wanting a new hose, even if the booster is good.

Anyone have a part # or source for this front hose? or a generic
replacement, like something NAPA might carry in bulk?

Have searched Pacific Parts &amp; VW Help fiche on Ratwell_dot_com, Bus Depot
catalog, thesamba, &amp; the archives, so far, to no avail.

Hoping I'm not the first to have this problem,

TIA,
