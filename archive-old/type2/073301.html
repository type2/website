&gt;I was searching the type 2 archives and found your post re baby seat

&gt;a hole in the rear deck but it seems like the fuel tank is in the way.

(This isn't the first email I've gotten on this.  Since this is a problem
many of us with kids and buses face, and given the safety importance, I'm
sending this to the list in general)

Folks,

This is one of those things I've been meaning to post about for some time.
I've actually been meaning to set up a web page on this, but no time.  So
I'll spill here.

I am of the strong opinion that a child set tether strap is required for a
young child's safety.  At the same time, buses weren't made with a specific
tether anchor point, and I hate drilling holes in buses.

There is one easily used place for a tether anchor on a bus, however, and
it doesn't require any holes to be drilled, and no permanent modifications
need to be made whatsoever.

The rear cargo door striker plate is attached with two good-sized bolts
which thread into a nice solid plate embedded within the &quot;beam&quot; that runs
under the rear lip of the cargo deck.  You're not going to find a more
solid attachment point if you were to drill a hole anywhere.  If someone
who knows bolts knows of stronger grade bolts that will fit, and what to
ask for, let me know and I'll be a big shot and string a few bucks for
stronger bolts.  The existing ones look pretty substantial, though, so I'm
not really worried about them.

So may I present my solutions to the tether anchor problem:
  1) the 5-minute, $1.35 solution
  2) the 2 -3 hour, $?? solution  (a much slicker installation).

1) El Cheapo method

Go to the hardware store and get about 18&quot; of that steel strip used to hold
water heaters to the wall for seismic code.  You know, the stuff that comes
in a long strip, and has holes drilled every inch or so.  Get the thick,
heavy duty stuff.  Get a small short bolt and a nut to match if you don't
have one that will fit the holes in the strip already in your nuts and
bolts jar at home.  Also get one of those chain-link shaped things that
have a threaded nut that threads closed to close the loop, you know one of
those things you use to attach two lengths of chain together.  Get the
smallest one you can find.

You will probably have to slightly enlarge one of the holes to allow the
striker plate bolt to pass through.

I got my strip, nut and bolt at Steveston Marine Hardware in Steveston B.C.
They even drilled the hole on their drill press for me.  Charged me $1.35,
tax included.  (That's well under a dollar in US funds, BTW).

Go back to your bus.  Mark the location of your striker plate.  Unscrew the
bolts (6mm hex, if I recall).  Insert the strip with the drilled hole
placed so that one of the striker plate bolts will pass through it when the
striker is reattached.  Reattach the plate, taking care to position it
according to your marks.  The striker plate will now sit slightly higher,
but shouldn't interfere with the opening/closing of the door.

Fold the other end over on itself to form an eyelet, inserting the
chain-link dohikey inside the loop thus formed.  Use the nut and bolt to
secure the folded eyelet closed.

Attach the tether strap's hook to the chain-link thing--this spreads helps
dissapate stresses over a larger cross-section on the strap.

Cinch that tether strap down tight!  You're done!


2) Kewl Sano Kustom method (just a refinement of (1), actually)

Face it: the water heater strap is ugly, even if it's functional.  I went
and got some casting plaster and took a mold of the body contours on my
bus, with the striker plate removed.  Using the mold, I drew up
specifications for a custom-made plate.  The plate has to make a few
compound bends to get up from the striker plate, under the cargo door, and
up a bit to make it peek up above the westy mattress.

I went to a machine shop near my office where they fabricate intelligent
robotics systems for spacecraft, figuring that anything good enough for a
spacecraft is probably good enough for my bus.  :-)  They made me up a
*gorgeous* plate out of a reasonably thick piece of stainless steel.  I
asked the design engineer if the plate would be thick enough to restrain my
kid, and he laughed and laughed, reassuring me it'd be strong enough to
restrain the lifeless bodies of every occupant in the car at an
unsurvivable impact velocity.  Yeah, thanks for the reassuring imagery...

My stainledss steel plate uses both striker plate bolts to secure it to the
bus, and has an eyelet formed by folding the plate and securing with a bolt
as used in version 1.

The only problem I'd like to address, should I make another version, is
that because the plate protrudes a bit near the mattress I'm a bit worried
that I may dig my head into the plate one night while sleeping in the lower
bunk--although that has not been a problem yet.  And if it does ever gouge
my scalp, the whole shebang can be removed entirely in under 2 minutes,
leaving the bus entirely stock and unscathed.

Some enterprising list vendor could make a little money fabbing and selling
a plate like this.  (hint, hint...).

Hope this helps, and encourages some listees to install an anchor plate in
their buses so their kids aren't confined to a T*y*ta until they're old
enough to use a lap belt!

Tobin

(And, no, I have neither the interest nor facilities to fabricate these
things myself.  If a list vendor wants to run with it, p-mail me and I'll
try to help however I can)
