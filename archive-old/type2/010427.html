We just put a Tiger 581 Magnetic Capacitive Discharge Ignition in our
'81 Vanagon. It works wonderfully well. Have been able to increase the
spark gap to .040. The next step will probably be a Pertronix ignitor
to replace the points, as I want a magnetic trigger, as opposed to an
optical trigger. The bus has more power, and runs smoother. On a local
hill, the bus would slow down to 28 mph going up the grade. Now, the
bus maintains the 35 mph speed limit on the same hill. If you look in
the archives, you can see the Tiger 581 is a tried and true CDI. Check
them out at:

They will send you a nice brochure upon request.
