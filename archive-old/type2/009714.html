&gt;the petro chemicals do shorten the life of  latex gloves especially gas,
&gt;usually I will change em after getting gas on em, the other greases etc, I
&gt;usually get em too dirty to use or want a soda (beer) long before they go
&gt;bad.

I use latex gloves, I find them invaluable as prolonged contact with oils,
etc brought on contact dermatitis - which is painful! E45 cream is unperfumed,
and not slippy, it is a moisturising cream that soothes this. I think barrier
cream is more/less the same thing.

Engine degreaser and (I think) gearbox oil attack the gloves more than other
chemicals, so I am forced to change them regularly when working with these. If
they do that to the gloves, imagine what they're doing to your skin!!!
