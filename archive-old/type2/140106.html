Subject: Re: [T2] sliding door won't pop open

...

&gt;
&gt;&gt;also, i remember reading that the cable/rod assy could be adjusted, 
&gt;&gt;but i don't see how that affestc the rear mount.
&gt;
&gt;This really sound like your issue, pull the panel and adjust the 
&gt;cable I bet it is just stretching, but due to gummy lock mech.

i see the bentley procedure,  but it really doesn't explain which 
direction to adjust on the top rod; also, it is vague on how to 
tighten the cable. i also like how it says that 'even after 
adjustment it might not work.' :)

&gt;&gt;last, could door geometry be a factor? the upper left corner 
&gt;&gt;doesn't sit as tightly as i'd like......
&gt;
&gt;This is all done with the front lower and upper rollers. Check your 
&gt;lower roller tray for wear.


LOL!! my roller track was SUPPOSED to have been repaired by armadillo 
auto in austin, tx - i gave them a HUGE section of clean bus to weld 
in. well, they simply unwrapped the outer skin and welded it OVER the 
old stuff! put in like 1&quot; of body caulk 'just like the factory.' i 
love the owner, but i laughed in his face. whatever, at least the 
roller wasn't dropping into a 2' slot.
and yes, besides being butt-ugly, it worked, so not a problem related 
to door-not-pop.
