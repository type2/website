&gt; Hi Folks,

&gt; My bails are tight -- so tight that I have to use a mini crowbar to snap
&gt; them into place.  I just pulled the covers off (in the last hour) to check
&gt; them, and both gaskets had pulled inward towards the center of the valve
&gt; cover.  I pushed them back out and put the covers back on the way they used
&gt; to be.
&gt;
&gt; I think I may need new gaskets, but it's only been about a year since these
&gt; were brand-new.  Is this the typical service life of gaskets, or should they
&gt; last longer?

If you want leak-free covers, replace gaskets every time the covers are
off.  Clean the covers well, particularly the gasket surfaces.  Check the
gasket surfaces on the head and cover for scratches.  You do not want
scratches.

Apply a thin coat of hylomar gasket dressing to the gasket surface of the
cover.  Put the gasket in place.  Leave the head-gasket interface
dry.  Carefully install the cover, making sure
that the gasket doesn't slide out of place when installing.  Check after
you've driven a few miles to make sure that things are leak-free

The hylomar is an excellent gasket dressing for this purpose, as it is
tacky enough to keep the gasket in place but never hardens.  It wipes off
with a paper towel making cleaning the next time a snap.
