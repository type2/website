After reading Haynes and the questions of safety, I thought I would share
these excepts:

Does the older VW have primitive anti-lock rear brakes? 
&quot;The rear brakes are fitted with a pressure regulator to prevent the back
wheels being locked in the event of emergency braking.&quot;
                              -VW 1700/1800/2000 Transporter 1972-1979 (All
models)
                               Haynes

Here is a small excerpt on the POWER of the VW bus:

&quot;The 1700cc version introduced in 1972 complete with manual or automatic
transmission was followed in 1974 by the 1800cc version. This will cruise
happily all day in the upper 70MPH bracket, if you can find a road to do it
on, and then turn off and tackle rough ground just as cheerfully&quot;

Now I suppose that they mean &quot;a road to do it on&quot; does not imply a downhill
slant, or heavy tailwind... but rather, a speedlimit which would make it
lawful to do so. :&gt;
