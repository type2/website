Subject: Re: [T2] Poor mans AC idea. 

Bob is right about the humidity out here (East Coast), which is the main 
reason for the ice cooler and such. Evaporative cooling (swamp coolers) out 
here is about like chrome exhaust tips, all for show.  I'll ditch the cold 
plate cooler idea and just use ice water in my cooler (makes it allot 
cheaper for me anyway).  I kind of thought there had to be a catch to those 
cold plates, either in electric draw or in heat exhaust.  I think my system 
will actually help take moisture OUT of the air.  That is the main reason I 
didn't want to just blow the fan over the cold water.  If I keep the water 
running through the system as cold as possible, the moisture in the air 
should condense on the little radiator I am going to use, just like on the 
coil (That's what they call them things ain't it?) in an AC system.  I will 
just make sure I have a way for that to drain off.

I didn't want to use a roof mount or one of those upright ones with the 
exhaust because those are only for when you have a 120V outlet like when 
camping.  I should be able to use this system whenever.  It shouldn't cost 
nearly as much as an ebarf swamp cooler or a roof mount AC.  I think I will 
be in the neighborhood of $50 when I'm done.  I figure cheap cooler $30, 
silicone tubing $10, computer case fan free (I'm in the bis.) and $10 for 
miscellany (caulk, expandafoam, pop rivets, etc.).  I also agree WestyDriver 
that there is a satisfaction to making your own solution, even if it's 
ghetto :-)  I don't know if I'll be able to make it keep up with such a 
large space on a hot day, but the bus will be well insulated, and it will be 
fun to try!  I'll put up pictures when I get it done, and let you know how 
it works out.

Thanks to all who replied, and to those who may reply to this email.
