Bob's words are hardly novel, this is the way most people have
been bleeding Bus lifters for years.  I think my words to a similar
effect are on the type2 site though I tend to compress the last
1/8&quot; or so using a vise ala the later Bentley procedure detailed
in the Vanagon Bentley as you can go too far by merely depressing
the check valve if you don't know what you are doing.  You can
go too far in the vice as well, but it is harder to do.  I urge anyone
to just seek out a late Bentley for the procedure, I doubt that they
will revise the Bus book anytime soon.  Oddly the Vanagon book
shows both procedures BTW, still says to use the old for the air
cooled even though they are the exact same lifters.  DOH!!
As to his words on air trapped lifters, I think we've noticed that a
number of times over the years as well on this list, and proffered
some solutions, I still adjust a new engine to 1 to 1 1/2 turns, now
at most I've only put together 4-5 T4's a year but I've never had a
problem doing it with compressions warm or cold, but I have observed
the problem he alludes to on Steve's old '73 ('79 engine) before we
put a rebuilt engine in it.  Anyway just some thoughts.

On an aside I have come buy quite a few sets of OEM hydraulics
recently, and will sell a set for $60 plus shipping to anyone interested.
I don't know the make but it is a nice OEM style hydraulic, I got 30
of them, and they look just like a set of Febi/Bilstein I have to compare
them with.
