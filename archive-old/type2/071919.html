I stopped by Lowes here in Dallas on the way home and struck out completely
with respect to the insulation.  They didn't have the stuff Mitch describes
and they didn't even have the Owens Corning stuff that I saw in Ohio.  So,
I will try to find something on my upcoming trip to Canada and bring a roll
back to Dallas with me.  Has anyone else found the good stuff yet?  That
would be the stuff with the smooth surface (not sandy like roofing material
which is what I saw in Ohio).  I WANT some!  =)
