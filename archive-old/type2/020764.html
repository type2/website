&gt; zero emissions just means the car doesn't  emit.  the commercials never talk

&gt; all we do is go from a bunch of smaller polluters to a couple of really
&gt; large pollulters, unless we are able to move to renewable energy resources
&gt; to power the plants.

Rawls:
But the really cool thing here and (I think close to George's original intent)
is that you can just buy a nice old bus, and maybe escape the &quot;lemmings march to
the sea&quot;
mentality of normal US consumers. NOT a disposable transportation appliance to
be traded in in 2,3,4 years whereupon you ante up for another one. DO drive less
miles, DO enjoy those miles more. DO take the family camping. BETTER YET, take
bicycles along more often. Knocked down, you can put several inside, with a good
deal more security than a bike carrier on an Insight.
