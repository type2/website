&lt;&lt;  With all the talk of trying to save our buses, how hard would it be for

&gt; local clubs to organize Co-op type salvage yards. How much red tape would

be

&gt; involved with such an operation? Does anything like this exist? Has anyone

&gt; tried this. No offense meant to many of our list members who operate

salvage

&gt; businesses. Its just that not everyone has a specialty salvage yard

located

&gt; near them. &gt;&gt;

Check your local community laws first...Find out just how many vehicles
constitute a &quot;salvage yard&quot; and what are the requirements? A junkyard
(there, I've said it) near my buddy in a formerly very rural area was 
forced to spend thousands just to put up a 10 or 12 foot wooden fence
next to the original chain link fence because the area was being developed
and the new homeowners objected to the visibility of the yard from the
roads. 
Another consideration is the EPA and such...
Don't take this as a negative vote, BTW, it's just that times change and
some of the same rules and regs that contributed to the demise of the
air-cooled VW are probably gonna be at work here too...;-(
