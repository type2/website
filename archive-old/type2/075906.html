Subject: Re: [T2] Fires don't always start with fuel lines

[...]

As one who drove aircooled VW's in the 60's, 70's and 80's in
California, New Jersey and Connecticut, I can tell you that VW's were
always over represented in the engine fire category.  The reason you
seldom see engine fires these days is that there are so few aircooled
VW's on the road.  I remember the times when you did spot an engine
fire, the odds were about 90 percent that it was a VW.  

Check those fuel lines and carry two fire extinguishers in different
locations.

&gt;&gt; Anybody actually know if VW's are more prone to fires than other
&gt;&gt; vehicles? Stats or any other sources...???
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;My own observations indicate that they are.  From years of driving 
&gt;the
&gt;freeways in LA, it seems that aircooled VWs are very 
&gt;&quot;overrepresented&quot; in
&gt;engine fires than other cars.
