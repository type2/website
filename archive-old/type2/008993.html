Subject: Replacing the oil-bath aircleaner and stand...
Message-ID: &lt;19990420022030.25760.rocketmail_at_web120.yahoomail_dot_com&gt;

All,

When I first bought my bus, I thought I wanted a set
of Dual-Kadrons and foolishly cut out my oil-bath
aircleaner stand. I have since seen the light and wish
to return to original.

The problem being that I no longer have the stand or
the oil-bath itself:-(  I'm not so gung-ho as to want
to weld in a new one and repaint; but more interested
in either pop-riveting one over the old piece (a
little bit of the old brace is still there in the
bus), or fabbing something totally new. Any ideas?

Anyone have an oilbath (I need it all) for a '69
w/1600 for cheap? I foolishly gave mine away and could
probably get it back, but that doesn't feel quite
right...


Thanks,

Jaime
