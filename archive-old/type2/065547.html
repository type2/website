Their service is outstanding, but how come no one ever mentions their huge
mark-up? In any event, in business terms they're doing the right thing by
targeting the growing segment of affluent hobbyists. After all, old VWs
have ceased to be a poor person's means of transportation and have instead
turned into Sunday cutesies for Eddie Bauer princes and princesses ;-)
(&quot;pardon me, would you have some... Salsa?&quot;).
