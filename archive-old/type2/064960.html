&gt;You show me ANY man's bus that cost $15K to
&gt;resto - put a beauty parlor babe next to it
&gt;and it's gonna get in Hot VWs - even without
&gt;an article written about it!!! But - let a lady
&gt;pull off a KILLER resto - submit quality
&gt;photos AND a nicely written article about it...
&gt;and SORRY! No flesh! You're outa-here!

NOW JUST WAIT A MINUTE HERE!  My entire view of
the wonderous state of California comes from reading 
Hot Tits and Engines....er...Hot VWs.  My impression
is that your state is populated by plastic blonds with
legs up to here, wearing tiny string what-em-a-call-its
and white high-heel shoes.  They spend most, if not all,
of their time leaning back against shiny VWs, or sitting
behind the wheel of same, flashing cleavage.  Even though
my bus is not yet repainted (just mechanically restored
and the interior completely redone) I am convinced that it will
also attract these silicon babes better than a shopping mall.

I've been busting my ass for the past month getting my bus ready
to drive to California--but now YOU are challenging my worldview! : {

I don't know if I can handle this.

 .....be on the road in no time. (but now I don't know if I want to)
