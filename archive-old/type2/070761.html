&lt;&lt; hey're ancient. When using an 009 with a 34.3 there will be a dead stop
upon 
 shift up through the gears. 
 Learn how to drive it best to eliminate that - overlap the clutch with the 
 gas pedal a bit more and it will go smoother.  &gt;&gt;

there was a good tech article a few years back about rebuilding the 34.3 carb
to eliminate the flat spot in a 009.  ans man does it ever work..!!!! no flat
spot under any conditions ever!!!!!!!
