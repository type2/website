hey all,
I have a couple of vanagon friends (80 - air cooled &amp; 86 - h2o) that
aren't on any list.  Is the fuel line situation as bad a deal for them? 
I know that their tanks are as low as the fuel circuit (unlike &lt;79s) but
the lines are still cloth/rubber and over the exhaust pipes - right?

If you're still not sold on replacing those fuel lines every few years
(and
if you're brave), check out this picture:
