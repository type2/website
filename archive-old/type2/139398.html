&gt; What grit paper should I use before applying topcoat?

400 wet/dry. You could go finer, but there's not much point

&gt; Can I just use newspaper to mask off an area for paint?

No way! Ink on newsprint smears. Go to home depot and get some masking
paper -- cheaper than what you'll find at autobody places.


Why are you going to clean metal, then using POR-15? It doesn't hurt, I
suppose, but it's really a one-or-the-other sort of thing. If you get
clean metal, really clean metal, then fill, etch, and prime. Forget the
POR-15 for that.
