1`) Sorry you missed Everybus - t'was a good time though wet
2) the poly &amp; duct tape will work.. You can cut out cardboard to fit the
opening, varnish it a few times to stiffen it (let the varnish dry
between coats)  Depends how fancy you want to get.
3) How you restore your bus is up to you.  Some folks drive their
restoration project daily
4) I never have a problem ignoring yard work in favor of working on one
of my babies.


Where's Ridgeway anyhow?  There's a bunch of us in the Charleston area
that help each other out with parts, advice, additional wrenching.
