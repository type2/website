Subject: Re: [Re: Type4 vs Type1 (longish)]

You're right dave - sorry. 
Quoting Tom Wilson from page 30:
&quot;If lifting a Type4 engine be prepared for a heavy load; it weighs about twice
as much as a Type1.  Thats about 300lbs for a Type4.&quot;

Hats off to you moving 300 lbs from the floor to the bench - i won't be
putting my back through that, nor will i be arm-wrestling you. :D

So i stand corrected - a tunrkey Type4 weighs about 150lbs more than a Type1.

&gt; Ummm... I have to disagree with this one.  :)  A complete type IV motor
&gt; with exhaust, intake, etc would be lucky to weigh 300 lbs.  I can lift the
&gt; long block up onto my workbench by myself.  I think the difference is
&gt; closer to 100-150 lbs.
