Subject: better cooling fans?

	Axial fans on vehicle motors, e.g just behind the (shudder) 
radiator of a typical (blecch) water-cooled car, can absorb several 
bhp at high revs, and make quite a noise.
	An elegant improvement, a decade or so ago, was the 'bendy 
blade' plastic fan.  The pitch is large, so that at low revs (idling 
&amp; creeping in traffic) bulk air is pumped.  A rigid-blade fan with 
this pitch would at high revs waste several bhp and make unnecessary 
noise.  But, with zero moving parts, the plastic blades bend so as to 
decrease the pitch at high revs.  I rank this as an  GOODLY  IDEA.

	The VW Type 4 motor  -  with which I have no experience  - 
has an axial fan.  Are the blades bendy?  If not, could more peak 
shaft hp be got from this motor by substituting a plastic fan?

	I'm more interested in the centrifugal fan in the &quot;upright&quot; 
Type 1 motor which I have in my bus.  This is rigid metal, and I'm 
sure the 'pitch' is dominated by the desire for adequate cooling at 
low revs.  Has anyone made a flexi-blade version, and what were the 
results?
