Seems like a pain in the butt, If you ask me.  I like the idea of a 
little hidden switch that cuts off power from the battery.

If you have a tachometer hooked up to the coil, you can rig up a simple 
switch to ground it, preventing engine starting.

Would you rather flip a hidden switch under the dash or mess around in a 
dirty engine compartment?
