Subject: Vinal Cleaner and Cargo Carpet

The '72 Bus reinstallation of interior parts continues.  While I try to be
as clean as possible, some of the new vinal headliner, seat covers, etc.
need to be cleaned.  What product is considered the best for this job?  I
personally do not use ArmorAll products.

A second problem is replacing the surface in the cargo area.  Is the
original material Felt?  Does anyone sell a precut piece to put on the
Engine Deck and Back seat area?

1972 Bus, 1982 Vanagon
