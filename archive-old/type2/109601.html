Subject: Idling problem

Hello everyone. I'm new to the list, have been using the archives and lurking
for a while, but now need help. I've got a 1974, 1800cc with dual Solex's.
Everything is stock.

I rebuilt the engine this past winter and everything went together and back in
the van without too much blood :-). Once getting the van up and running, I
started having problems with the carbs. It was obvious the throttle shaft
bushings were gone so I had them rebushed and put a new carb rebuild kit in
each. I've set up the adjustment screws as described in the archives and other
resources, but I cannot get it to idle properly. Here's what I've done;

Taken the carbs apart and cleaned them with carb cleaner
New dist cap, wires, rotor, points, condenser
Set the dwell to 48deg
Timing to 10 ATDC
Put a spacer in the idle cut-off valve to make sure it wasn't sticking closed
New fuel filter and lines - seems to be getting fuel since it will rev OK and
will drive - but will not idle (i.e. after the choke opens the engine speed
drops until it either dies or revs at ~400 RPM).
Replaced the vacuum lines and gone over the hoses to ensure there is no
leaking

I've tried adjusting the idle speed screws and main volume control screw, but
they don't seem to have an effect. I'm beginning to wonder if it's not carb
related but the ignition. There is play perpendicular to the distributor shaft
(I think this is called axial play?). Could this be the source of the problem.
I want to replace the distributor economically but also want to have vacuum
advance? Is this possible? She's also been backfiring during acceleration
lately.

Please help, I feel like I'm going nowhere.

Thanks.
Matt
