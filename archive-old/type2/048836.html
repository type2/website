Hi Alex,

    Your book is refuring to the bearing surface. They should be very smooth
and shinny. Don't take any chances. Take your crankshaft to an automotive
machine shop, and have it &quot;miked&quot;, otherwise your just quessing! You also
need to check the case for line-bore, and thrust bearing to case end play.
    This is not the place to try to save money, or time.
