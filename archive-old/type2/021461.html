Neil:
You need to split the case if you're changing the cam.
It depends what cam you have in there now. If it's the stock 74-75 cam, it's
already for solids anyway. If it's a 78 or later hydraulic cam, you'll need to
change to a cam designed for solids. BTW, if going this far and what you want
is more power consider getting the cam used in early 1700's and Porsches.
Basically it's a little more duration and lift.
This cam change was the only difference between the two engines used in 73 in
the automatics and the stick cars. The horsepower was 62 and 66 hp
respectively. It would probably be worth about the same increase on an 1800
engine.

&gt;   I'm just wondering if it is possible to switch back now without breaking
&gt; open the case. I guess I'll just be pulling out the hydraulic lifters and
&gt; putting in regular ones,right? Anything else I need to do?
&gt;
