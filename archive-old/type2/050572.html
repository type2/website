Content-Disposition: inline

Hello list,

My Type IV is totally stripped down to the engine block at this point.  The inside of the case appears to be in pretty good shape.  Some varnish and scorching on the rods etc (nothing major).  Nothing appears violently broken or sheared off.  Measurements of the rods indicate that they are not exhibiting excessive wear according to the manuals.  So, should I leave it alone?  Obviously cleaning would be much easier if it were apart but I am worried about destroying the seal on the case at this point as it looks good.  If I dont crack the case open, which parts should be cleaned and how?  Some grit will most liketly enter the case while cleaning the exterior.  Can this be flushed out?  Thank you Thank you Thank you

Chad
