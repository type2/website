Hi Dave,

    Next time try some &quot;Easy Off&quot; oven cleaner. Not quite as risky!
    By the way, you can take a propane torch and very lightly heat (
&quot;around&quot; not in the crack ) where you suspect a crack. If there is indeed a
crack, oil will bubble and boil up out of the crack.
    Have a good one.

Howard

&gt; I got several replies about the crack and the majority felt that I might
&gt; as well clean it up, apply JB weld if I want, and see how far she'll
&gt; take me.
