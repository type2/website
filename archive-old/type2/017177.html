Iggy:

To clarify some advice someone else offered: do *not* expect the fuel
pump (located approximately above the driver's side rear half shaft) to
operate when the ignition key is turned on.

The electric fuel pump operates only under two conditions: (1) when the
starter motor is being operated, and (2) when the engine is running.

The double relay previously pointed out is what controls this.

See Sean Bartnik's excellent treatise on the AFC fuel injection system
(as well as other stuff) at: http://www.type2_dot_com/bartnik/tech.htm

&gt;I read in the idiots manual that
&gt;jumping the car is the best way
&gt;to kill your FI and Alternator

No, there are better ways.  I've jump-started my FI '78 on several
occasions with no damage to either.
