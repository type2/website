Subject: Re: [T2] cyl head removal 75 bus

&gt;&gt;...appears to be running on 3 cyls and 
did the plugwire removal trick and yep # 3
is deas verified by putting a 
different wire on it.&lt;&lt;

Ray,

before pulling the engine, did you change out the spark plug?
yes, changing the wire will tell you if the wire is bad, but
i would also remove &amp; inspect the spark plug on that cylinder
before removing the motor.

good luck,

Joel Wilson
