Subject: Auburn Hills show?

Steve D. sent a note to the list about an Auburn Hills show in May...

This is the second reference to the 'Auburn Hills show' on the weekend
of the 20th.  I live in Michigan about 2 hours from Detroit (ok, three
in the bus) and would love to go but I can't find any more info about
this one.  Does anyone know who is holding it, if it is just VWs and is
there a website with
more info about where, when and if camping is allowed?

Anyone?
