Subject: Re: Heads/GEX SAGA

&gt;So first, we all start yelling about how GEX had better kiss Dave C's hiney
&gt;because there are hundreds watching, and now we knock them because they
&gt;do??
&gt;Looks like a no-win situation for them.  Come on, give them a little credit
&gt;for doing the right thing, even if for the wrong reason.

Nobody knocked GEX because they *did* replace the heads. I think people
strongly suspect that Dave *only* got his heads replaced because GEX
figured out that there were hundreds watching. That's good, I suppose--at
least for listys.

But it has the smell of doing the right thing because you got caught doing
the wrong one, and only for that reason.

Better than not replacing the heads, is replacing them for the wrong
reason. I agree. But better than having to replace the heads (as you note)
is not making shoddy heads in the first place. This is the point that
shouldn't be submerged. All these problems, for us and for GEX both, go
away if the goods are good.

&gt;If they only make the occasional mistake and acknowledge it
&gt;&gt;when they do,
&gt;
&gt;They just DID acknowledge it.

No, they didn't. They're pretending there's really nothing wrong with their
heads and engines. They're playing rhetorical games. They're demanding
credit for the times they *don't* screw up, which is pretty
audacious--that's what they get paid for.

If we were just muscle-flexing, it might be a no-win situation for them.
But the experience of many of the people on these lists suggests that GEX's
quality record is abysmal. There's an easy way for them to win this that
makes everybody happy. Make decent products. Do what you said you were
going to do, maybe even more. They aren't doing that, and that's why
they're getting an earful--not because we just feel like shagging somebody.
