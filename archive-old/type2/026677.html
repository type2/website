Hi Volks,

There was some query recently about the cups that hold the medium/large
front VW emblem on, I think, 68 - 71? type IIs.  Many of us took the emblems
off and mounted front spare tire racks using these four holes and now want
to replace the emblems.  The emblems are around, I was lucky to score an
essentially brand new one recently from a salvage yard, but the retainer
cups are not available, as far as I can tell.  

Anyway, I bought a set of nylon screw rivets, .230 diameter, which I believe
should do the trick.  Haven't installed them yet, as the front end is not
ready, but thought I'd pass on the idea.  Bought them at the local Pep Boys
under the &quot;Rivet Tite&quot; trademark, item number 47952.

Remove and discard the center nylon screws, coat the rivets with clear
silicone sealant, insert in holes, put a dab of clear silicone sealant on
the splined emblem pins and install emblem.   The rivets fit snug into the
holes and the emblem pins snug into the rivets.  The rivets expand to lock
in the holes when the pins are pushed through.  With the silicone, they
should hold the emblem firmly and without leaks.  If you use a different
size/brand of nylon rivet, be sure that the rivets don't stick into the
holes more than 3/4&quot; as this is all the clearance there is.  

If you try it and it works, let us know.  Again, sorry I haven't been able
to try it myself before posting.
