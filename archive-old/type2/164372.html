Subject: fan seal

Hi,

 

I put my fan seal on by hand and it is level with the case of the engine.

 

My engine at the split is a few mm offset from the other, the part that is
set back and the seal is seated at the part that is sticking forward.

 

Is there a shoulder for seating the seal?

 

I don't want to tap this thing any more.

 

Cheers,

 

Alan
