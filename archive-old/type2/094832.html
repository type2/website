Subject: Re: [T2] Thermostat- to fit or not to fit?

Hi Matt

Basically its your choice. If id just spent £800+VAT on a VEGE id fit the 
thermostat. If the type 1 didnt need it VW wouldnt have fitted it ;).

However I resently fitted a VEGE to my friends bus and he opted not to fit 
the flaps or stat. Hes ran it now for 3,000 miles without problems but he 
does let the bus **warm up well** in a morning before he drives it.

Id highly recoomend a VEGE recon engine to anyone, its very quite and smooth 
and well worth the money IMHO.

FWIW vege fit a temp sensor on the block to see if the engine has been 
overheated for there warranty. Im not sure how this sensor equates to head 
or oil temps as it measures the heat of the block inside the fan housing. 
Also if you fitted the VEGE engine yourself you dont have a warranty unless 
you get a garage to stamp the warranty book to say its been fitted 
correctly.

Hope that helps a little
