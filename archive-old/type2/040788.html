Subject: RE: Stupid Me, dropped my spark plug

	I've lost count of the number of spark plugs I've dropped 
into aircooled shrouds :) Fortunately, you can use a $4 'grabber'-
a hardware-store gizmo with what looks like a hypodermic handle
at one end, a 20&quot; (.5m) spring steel body and four (in my case) hooks
at the end that extend when you mash the 'plunger' at the handle.
Requires less than 30 seconds practice to learn how to use. We
keep ours near the laundry machines in the garage because its
also the PERFECT tool for fishing baby socks, etc, out from between the
washer and dryer :)

	Ron's right though, the plug won't hurt much just hanging around
inside the shroud. Blocks cooling air a little, and I wouldn't make
it a habbit, but I wouldn't pull an engine to get out a lost one
either.

	Bill
