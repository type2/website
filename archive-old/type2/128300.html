&gt; OTOH, sometimes the liability concerns go too far...My buddy and I went

&gt; we wanted was the tires put on the empty rims, but the clerk said he
&gt; &quot;had&quot; to know the make, the model, and the year to make sure the tires
&gt; were correct for the car... :-(

More likely so that the information could be added to a database sold to
others who hawk automotive parts.  The computer has fields for the info,
it won't accept the transaction unless the fields are filled, so the sales
drone insists that you fill them in!

Just tell him  that the tires are for a '57 Borgward!  :)
