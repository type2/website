&gt; I hate to start this thread again, but I looked on the type2 library and found
&gt; some good info on tires, but most of these tires are discontinued. What is
&gt; everyone running on their busses now and how do they like them? The Yoko 370
&gt; LT's seemed to be the best, but not available anymore.

Michelin currently has some 195R70-14 light truck tires, load range &quot;C&quot; on
sale
