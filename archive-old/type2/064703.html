&gt;I have been tempted to do what yoour PO did and rewire the horn withan

Your steering column might be loose like mine was.  Look underneath, get a
Binford 3000 phillips screwdriver and tighten everything you see.  In
particular there are two phillips screws, one on either side, that if
loose, can cause the horn to beep randomly.  Ask me how I know... no go
ahead, ask me!

Okay, I'll tell you.  When I pulled my dashboard out, I removed all of the
screws from the steering column, but when I put it back together I must
have forgotten to replace/tighten all of them.  Shortly after I started
driving the bus again, the horn started to go off without pressing the
button, but just sometimes.  I unplugged the horn and basically forgot
about it until the Mammoth trip.  As Joel and I were pulling out of the
campground at Mammoth, I thought I would hook the horn back up for the trip
home, thinking the problem might have gone away.  At first, all was well,
but as I rounded a corner, the horn started to beep like crazy.  Just then
Beth and Lisa went by the other way in their Jetta, heard my horn beeping
like crazy, and waved.  Joel and I waved back, and then pulled over to
disconnect the horn.  Wonder if Beth and Lisa noticed that neither of my
hands was on the horn button?  I was using both hands swerving to try and
get the horn to stop beeping!

Anyway, when I looked under the steering column, I noticed that I had
neglected to tighten the screws back up, and one was even missing.  I
replaced the missing screw with an unimportant one of the same size from
elswhere in the dash, reconnected the horn, and all was well for the next
1,700 miles.  No random beeping.  Well that's my foolish story for the day,
hope you enjoyed it.  :-)
