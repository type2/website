Subject: 1st time siting; no oil drain plug?

hi - two weeks ago i adopted a stray AHxxxxxx engine out of a 71 hardtop
westy. nice deal upon closer inspection - DP heads have brand new guides,
all the dog house thermostat stuff is there including hoover bit, and i
fig'd, well what to do with this case. i went to undo the oil plug and to
my surprise odd strainer with no plug. just six 10mm nuts under the sump.
research shows this is a 74bug engine. did they really have to undo all
those nuts to change oil? can that plate be replaced with one having a
plug. heavens to betsy  - steve, dun't remember ever driving a bug...
