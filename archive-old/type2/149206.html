Have you tried to verify the fuel pressure?

&gt;I think this means no power
&gt;from the double relay terminal 86.  I confirmed this and found also no
&gt;current at terminal 86a from the solenoid (while cranking).  At the
&gt;solenoid, there are 4 connections (news to me).  One is a bundle of wires
&gt;including direct battery voltage. 

Terminal 30.

&gt;One is the big ground strap.

That is how the starter gets power. The case is the ground.

&gt;One is a
&gt;double spade connection (term 50?) with the solenoid trigger from the
&gt;ignition switch (via a WR-1 relay, in this case).  The other spade terminal
&gt;was empty. Voltage here was ~8-10V during cranking (normal?).

The solenoid needs at least 7V to kick over. There should be a voltage drop at the battery while the starter is operating and since everything is tied to terminal 30 I would expect to see the cranking voltages you saw if there was high resistance in the wiring. It's a big wire so I would check your battery and starter terminals for cleanliness.

&gt;But, the bus still starts!  I don't get it.  Where's the fuel pump
&gt;getting power from (I confirmed that it gets power during cranking)?  Could
&gt;the AFM flap deflect enough during cranking to trip the fuel pump switch in
&gt;the AFM?

During cranking, the flap in the AFM oscillates as the pistons pump and this deflects the needle. I'm not sure if it's enough to provide constant voltage to the fuel pump for startup all vacuum levels (engine condition) but I suspect it might for most.

&gt;First attempt:  I moved the Red/White wire at the solenoid up to the empty
&gt;spade connector by the ignition switch solenoid trigger (term 50?).  Now
&gt;there's voltage at 86a and the cold start connector (~8-10 volts during
&gt;cranking).

That sounds like a short to me.

&gt;Questions:  Why is there a 4th solenoid terminal?  I haven't changed any
&gt;wiring, and it used to start perfectly in any weather.  What happened?  Why
&gt;did it start at all??

There are two spaded terminals at 50 but they are connected to each other.
