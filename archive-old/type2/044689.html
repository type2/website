Subject: Re: [T2] repairing carbs?

Hi,

Rebuild the carbs,  While they are apart, check for sloppy throttle shaft bores.
The bores in the base can be bushed. Not a difficult, nor expensive job for most
machinist's or carb repair shops.  Also check the seats and adjustment needles.

Keep smiling,

Mike
