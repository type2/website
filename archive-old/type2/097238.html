Subject: Re: [T2] Starter/Bolt

&gt; How do you locate and hold the nut on the top bolt of a defective starter,
&gt; it's a '78 Microbus. The starter is held by a bolt at the top and a stud
&gt; and nut at the bottom. The bolt head is not hexagonal, it is circular with
&gt; a flat part of the head which engages in a recess in the starter mounting
&gt; frame. Access to the nut on the engine side is between the fan housing and
&gt; the bulkhead in the engine compartment? How do you get to it? Do you have
&gt; to take off any tin? Can't seem to identify it from the engine side.

You do not hold the nut. The starter holds the bolt. You have to unscrew the
nut.
Remove the lid over the engine.
Open the rear hatch.
Remove the air tube between the blower fan and tin.
From the top, remove the hose going to the EEC valve on the front of the
aircleaner coming from the charcoal cannister.
Disconnect the vacuum line going to the EEC valve.
Unplug the air flow meter.
Loosen the screw clamp on the big S hose.
Loosen the clip on the bottom of the air cleaner.
Lift up and remove complete air cleaner out the rear.
Disconnect the hoses going to the big S hose: at the vent unit, at the aux
valve, and at the decel valve.
Losen the screw clamp on the bottom of the big S hose.
Remove big S hose from engine.
[this takes longer to read then to do!]
Now you can remove the nut down in front of the throttle housing.....
