Subject: Accelerator cable for 75 Weekender

After the last engine removal/reinstallation my accelerator cable seemed to 
shrink in length, so I figured it must be snagged somewhere along the way.  
While trying to remove it today it has become really stuck good.  I have 
about 3 feet of it our of the front of the bus, and it won't come out any 
further, nor will it go back in.  What to do now?

Thanks in advance,
