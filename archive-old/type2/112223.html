&lt;&lt; It occurs to me that whenever the Cuban embargo ends, there is
a vast reservoir of relatively ancient cars in Cuba which, 
unexposed to road salt, might be rust free as well.  Wondering
if that would include the odd but interesting 50's era VWs?

You're a little late...Almost every antique, collectable, etc. mag has
run at least one article on that idea...Besides, even free, a VW has
to be shipped from Cuba, adding to the cost of the vehicle...
