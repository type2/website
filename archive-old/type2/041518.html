Does anyone know where I can get a set (8) of Rocker Arm Studs for my 82 Vanagon?  The previous owner seemed to have a real talent for $#_at_&amp;*!_at_ things up and they are all striped, it was a royal pain getting the 4 out I have managed to free so far, and I still have the other side to do.

Thanks,
Nate
