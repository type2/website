Subject: Broken EZ Out &amp; adventures in replacing the rear brakes on a
  '69 Bus

Listees,

I need some advice/moral support.  

I am replacing the rear brakes on my '69 Bus (Westfalia).  I started on the passenger side and
removed the drum, shoes, wheel cylinder, and springs.  I'm now down to the backing plate.  It
needs to be replaced since it's pretty mangled.  It appears to me that there are three capscrews
that hold the backing plate on: the one that holds the wheel cylinder, and the two that hold the
adjusting screw bracket.

One of the capscrews that holds the adjusting screw bracket had the head broken off by someone who
owned the bus prior to myself.  I was able to drill a hole straight through the remainder of the
capscrew, and I installed an EZ out to back out the remnants.  Bad decision on my part.  The EZ
out broke off inside the drilled hole.  There isn't enough of the EZ out hanging to grab ahold of,
so my assumption is that I will have to somehow drill it out.  I tried using a set of cobalt drill
bits that I have with basically no success.

Any ideas out there from anyone that has dealt with this before?  I may be able to knock the
broken EZ out backwards since the hole that holds this capscrew goes completely through the
bracket (I can see the tip of the EZ out from behind the backing plate).

Will the adjusting star bracket come off after this capscrew is removed?  I've tried prying it
straight out since the hole the in the bracket itself doesn't have any threads, but I haven't had
any success their either.

Hope, IN
