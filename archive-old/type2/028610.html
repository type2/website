The big problem with that is that Outlook will only put 32767
items in a folder. Anybody figure out a way to turn the items
in the folder into regular files? You could put the files in
a directory and use grep to find what you want.

given all the recent hoopla over the archives, i thought i would post
this little bit of info:

if you are using a mail program similar to outlook, you can create your
owm simplified version of the archives.  just save all of the digests
in a folder &amp; use the mail programs search tool, just like the archives on
the web. of course, the search tool in the mail program will not be
as functional or flexible as the web search tool, but you will at least 
have a simpler version of the archives at your disposal.

FWIW, YMMV, &amp; the usual disclaimers apply.
