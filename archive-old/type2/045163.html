Don-
as a general rule, if those CV bolts are not too tight
a 6mm allen wrench will work just fine, and i suggest
replacing them with allen head cap screws ( the same
bolt except with the allen head.) much easier to find and
fix on the road. be sure to clean the gunk out of them
before you apply the tool, so that it will bottom and go
slowly so as to not strip the fastener.
