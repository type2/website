Subject: RE: [VB] VWofA hassle; new aftermarket crankshaft pulley

&quot;cannot see how it would clear the tin&quot;

I believe the article said one would need to modify the tin in order to fit
the new pulley.


As well as the oil pump cover and bolts, if it's an aftermarket 
filter-outlet pump, and you may have trouble elsewhere too. I have a &quot;stock&quot; 
sized degree pulley on my engine and the clearancing for it took the better 
part of a day (I used a Dremel).
