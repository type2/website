&gt; Quick question:
&gt; 
&gt; Will an auto trans from an '83.5 Vanagon fit in a '79 Bus?  Daryl at AA
&gt; says that he thinks so.  Anyone know fer sure?

the answer is yes and no

it will fit but it takes some modifing of a few things 

different folks have different takes on what it takes.
I have a 78 auto tranny and I have not seen a Vanagon auto tranny that I
think will fit without more work than I think it is worth.
