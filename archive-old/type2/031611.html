&gt; Well I don't want to burn the bus or me up. I have heard of some installing
&gt; the heater under the passenger floorboard and am going to look into doing it
&gt; that way for now, if there is room for that.

that I believe was the stock location for the BA-6

&gt; The decision is a tough one, but I am itching to install the heater. Anybody
&gt; else who wants to send me more input or their stories is always welcome,
&gt; even if you decide to call me stupid!

it should be in the archives, but I have a BA-4 under the front floor
mounted on the old AC evaporator mount... it is recirculating and the
stock heating system has been completely removed,  (was rusted out anyway)

air is pulled in under the dashboard. run through ducts to the underside
through the heater and back into the standard front heating ducts

tis a very warm bus even in the dead of winter, and I ski and have been in
some pretty cold places in that bus
