You need an air fuel ratio gauge, and alot of patience to get it right!

&gt; Unfortunately, think the only way to test it is on a bench with some
&gt; kind of metered airflow.  I've tried to find specs but nobody has them,
&gt; or is willing to share them..
&gt;
&gt; I messed with mine ALOT but I could never really get it right.. I
&gt; finally swapped out a working one..

&gt; &gt; I was wondering if there is a way to determine if an AFM is adjusted
&gt; &gt; properly - ie is the big coil spring set correctly?  Is there a
&gt; &gt; specification for how much torque it should take to open the flap all
the
&gt; &gt; way or some such thing?  I suspect that the spring on one that I have is
too
&gt; &gt; tight.  I'm wondering because I have an almost brand new rebuilt AFM
that
&gt; &gt; runs my engine very lean (great for smog tests), but can't be adjusted
to my
&gt; &gt; or my mechanic's comfort level (with gas analyzer) using the idle adjust
&gt; &gt; screw.  I'm using another AFM right now and trying to get this 'bad' AFM
in
&gt; &gt; working order to use as a spare on an upcoming xcountry trip.  Any
&gt; &gt; suggestions?

&gt; &gt; P.S.  My wife used to complain that the bus was difficult to drive in
the
&gt; &gt; wind - I thought she was just whining until I replaced the steering box
and
&gt; &gt; steering damper - Thanks Bus Depot for selling me the parts to make my
bus a
&gt; &gt; pleasure to drive on the highway, and my wife happy.
&gt; &gt; P.P.S.  If you see oil and crud on your steering box - check to see if
it
&gt; &gt; still has oil inside it.  The one I took out was covered in greasy
sludge
&gt; &gt; and dry as a bone inside.  I wonder why my steering was so tough.
&gt; &gt; P.P.P.S  Sorry if I am babbling - excited about upcoming trip.
