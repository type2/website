Subject: Fwd: Re: [T2] auxiliary air regulator characteristics

OOK: My problem is   idle too low rather than too high. Doing the 
freezer test is a great idea. I'll do this.

I would like to spray Kroil onto the disc mechanism, but I wouldn't 
want this to drip onto the heater coil. Do you happen to know if the 
coil is in a separate compartment from the disc?

All this is probably way too much attention to be paying this gadget; 
for all but the most anal of us, that is.  Of course, that includes 
most of us, doesn't it?

Jack
