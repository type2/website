Subject: [T2] What is this part?

On my 74 Campmobile, located on the upper left corner of the fuel tank
panel there is this electric/vacuum thingy, on the base there are two
vacuum connectors and three small male electrical connections on the
other end there is a single vacuum connection. The vehicle is a
standard, sold originally in Maine( although it has traveled widely
since)  and has a BN-4 heater.
I hate curiosities in my engine bay
