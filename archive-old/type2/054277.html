Subject: engine runnin flat...

hey volks,
well the engine is back in and was runnin great till
this morning.   took off from my house and everything
was normal, then a little sputter, its fine, sputter,
fine, then just no power.   runnin about 35-45 to
work.   seems like a vacuum leak or intake leak, but i
checked the vacuum lines quickly and couldnt find
anything loose.   ill have some time this afternoon to
play with it, but im wracking my brain tryin to figure
out what it is.   any ideas??
TIA
