Subject: Re: [T2] '78 decel valve

--Barry,

Odds are 492-1 that Karl has disected this issue in the archives, I seem to remember reading it.

When mine went bad, and I didn't even know it, Karl diagnosed it and hooked me up a junkyard one and it made lots of difference.

The difference being, when you let off the gas from high RPM's, the bus will settle down nicely to it's new RPM range. (DECELERATION, right?) Without it, it will chop and sputter and generally be unladylike about relaxing.

Billy


&gt;I have a Federal '78 manual trans Westy.  It looks like the decel valve I 
&gt;would need is...
&gt;
&gt;  022-133-551B  Decelerator Valve Bus MT 1976 to 1978
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Can I use either of the following??
