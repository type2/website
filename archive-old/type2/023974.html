&lt;&lt;So...are you saying that the materials (not to mention the
stress-ratings) used in making seat-belts for a type II 30+ years ago
are inferior to the ones used in the last decade? If so, I'd have to
dissagree.&gt;&gt;

NO, I am only speaking of new bolts and materials you purchase to retrofit the
Vanagon seatbelts, or longer bolts needed to mount the new Mexican seatbelts. 

&lt;&lt;Also, the only bolts that will work for this application are either
the original, or new (and very hard to find) machine bolts which are
subject to higher ratings than they were 30 years ago. The new are
also not subject to metal fatigue; as the original are.&gt;&gt;

I had no trouble finding new machine bolts.  Just look in the Yellow Pages.

&lt;&lt;Yes, but they are NOT original. They were NOT designed to be
retro-fitted in older busses. They were also not designed to meet with
U.S. standards for front-impact collisions (or any other for that
matter).&gt;&gt;

I disagree with you here.  The Mexican bus is just about identical to the US
(German built) bus.  So the new seatbelts are designed for the same vehicle.
I don't know however if the new belts meet the same standards as the US spec.
Buses belt did, I suspect that they exceed the original standards.  One
important fact is that the new belts will fit you much better, more people
would use them because they're more comfortable.  I will translate the text
from the belts and post it later.  There is a SAE standards number marked on
them.

&lt;&lt;As the retailer/seller of these seat-belts, you assume some pretty
serious liability here. I can only assume from your post that you've
done none of these tests to prove the safety of these seat-belts. True?&gt;&gt;

False, I assume no liability for these.  You use at your own risk.  I will
further look into this to see if these meet US standards though.

&lt;&lt;That disclaimer isn't enough. Ask your lawyer.&gt;&gt;

Oh, but yes it is.  These are made by VW not me.  If you blew a tire because
of an internal defect and it caused an accident, would you sue the company
that installed it?  You would have to prove that they knew the tire was
defective when it was installed.

&lt;&lt;OKAY, enough preaching on my part. I realize that you are only trying
to address a gripe on the part of fellow type II owners and possibly
make a buck or two at the same time.&gt;&gt;

I'm trying to make a buck or two through my business, and not from this list.
I will only recover my costs by offering these seatbelts for only $150 to the
list.

&lt;&lt;As I said, it's a matter of liability. If that weren't the case, I'm
quite certain that the bigger companies (BusBoys, etc.,) would be
selling them.&gt;&gt;

I think they are selling seatbelt kits.  The kits I've seen offered in the
past have not been VW, but were similar to what JCW sells.  Lots of vendors
sell seatbelts.

I'm not wanting to start a seatbelt war here.  I did post in my previous
message that the new Mexican seatbelts were &quot;use at your own risk&quot;  I just
wanted to point out that using used seatbelt from a Vanagon or other vehicle
is possibly a greater risk.
