Subject: Re: [T2] Tranny fluid

   I have a 70 with a manual trans that I had to drain. Now I am ready to
fill her up but I have been following the other thread about using GL4 and
not GL5 in the transaxle. I am unclear as to whether or not the fluid has to
be strictly GL4. The reason is that all I can find is GL3, GL4, GL5
combinations at the FLAPS. If I'm supposed to use only GL4 then where do I
get it?
Thanks,
Jim
