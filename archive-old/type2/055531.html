Baja Attacks Raise Concerns About the Safety of Travelers

The news was disheartening, but not altogether surprising: &quot;Two
Northern Nevada men, who hadn't been heard from since the second
day of a planned two-week fishing trip to Mexico in November, have
been found dead in Baja California.&quot;

The bodies of Alan Swan, 37, of Gardernville, and Herb Dohr, 42,
of Reno, were reported to have been discovered Dec. 9 in San
Quintin, a small agricultural village about 200 miles south of
the border, but it was more recently made public that they were
found in nearby El Rosario.

The men, reportedly killed by sharp blows to the head, were
identified by relatives last week and a homicide investigation
is underway.

And while their families grieve, tourists considering a drive down
the desert peninsula are left wondering how safe they will be.

Those dismissing the apparent murders as happenstance may want to
consider a few other episodes in the same general area in the last
several months:

Last March, a couple from Placerville, CA, was passing through
El Rosario and pulled over on a deserted section of highway to
spend the night in the trailer they were towing. The man and
his wife were awakened by knife- and machete-wielding bandits
who smashed their windows, slashed their tires and demanded
all their cash.

A month later, in the San Quintin area, which is popular among
fishermen and surfers, there was a rash of robberies in campgrounds
and hotel parking lots. Thieves reportedly were breaking into cars
and trucks -- in some cases while people were sleeping only a few
feet away -- prompting hotel owners to hire armed guards.

Earlier this month, Fred Jones, executive director of the Vagabundos
Baja travel club, issued warnings to members based on reports of
two families being robbed in the area. One family's vehicle was stolen
and the other's was &quot;shot up&quot; and rolled over, with two children inside.

Said Earle Robitaille, former chief of the Huntington Beach Police
Department and an avid Baja traveler for 40 years, &quot;I told this story
to a friend (last week) and he told me a group of his surfing buddies
experienced the same group of armed thugs while on a trip there.

&quot;They were robbed at gunpoint and the M.O. was identical... jerked
out of their tents in the middle of the night, blankets thrown over
their heads, kicked around a bit and everything of value thrown into
a waiting pickup and their vehicles stolen.&quot;

Robitaille, 66, who on his popular Amigos de Baja web site
(http://bajanet_dot_com) had been issuing pleas to other Baja travelers
to be on the lookout for the two missing Nevada men, warned visitors
to avoid the area after the bodies were discovered. And he was critical
of Mexico's efforts in handling what has obviously become a
serious situation.

&quot;The business people in the area better start forming some sort of
vigilante group to deal with a problem the Mexican government is
incapable of dealing with, or there are going to have no business to
worry about,&quot; he said.

In a statement obtained this week by Jones, Felizardo Palacios of the
State Tourism Delegate in Ensenada acknowledged that the bodies of
Swan and Dohr were found Dec. 9, more than 200 yards apart near a
river in El Rosario, and that &quot;The district attorney in San Quintin is
investigating for a quick conclusion, and officials are searching for
parts of the truck that were stripped down.&quot;

Palacios also said, &quot;Officials are traveling to San Quintin, Guerrero Negro
(farther south) and El Rosario to check on security for tourists and
try to improve security. The tourism department has been, and continues
trying to educate tourists to stay in areas closer to town and stay away
from remote areas.&quot;

That's the same advice given by Baja travel clubs. But Robitaille, drawing
on his police experience, offers a few more tips for traveling south of the
border:

Try to travel with other vehicles and don't drive at night

Don't camp on the roadway anywhere unless you have a group of RVs. Try
to stay in an improved commercial (RV) park.

Split  your money into four or five stashes and hide them separately. Carry
only
enough cash for one day at a time.

Don't flaunt large bills and leave expensive rings, watches and jewelry
at home.

Check window and door locks in any hotel or motel room and if they are
broken, get another room.

&quot;Mexico has a growing crime problem that is equal to or exceeds that of most
countries in the world,&quot; Robitaille said. &quot;That, coupled with weak and
decentralized government and law enforcement, does not make for
comfortable travel...&quot;

&quot;What it really amounts to is, if you fly in and go straight to the hotel and
fish all day, you will have few problems unless you do something stupid
or provacative in and around bars at night. Travelers who are driving just
have an increased risk due to increased exposure.&quot;
