Subject: Friday musings, Buses &amp; Harleys

Ahhh, Friday!
Let me start by saying that I am not now, nor have I ever been a motorcycle rider. Down the street from me there are a couple of guys who are Harley Davidson bikers. Nice enough guys, but those bikes used to just kill me.  They go rumbling by all night making ALL THAT NOISE! I have never understood the appeal of the Harley. Then last night a buddy came over to the house to show me his &quot;new&quot; Harley soft tail. It was loud, way too expensive, and he says that you really have to baby them and give them a lot of maitenance attention. So I asked him why not spend HALF the money, get a honda or kawasaki bike in better shape that requires less maintenance and runs quieter.  To which he promptly responded: &quot;Well, why don't you get a Ford Aerostar or Plymouth Voyager Mini-van that runs quieter, is more reliable, and requires less maintenance than all those VW buses?!?!&quot;   Ahhhhhhh, NOW I GET THE HARLEY APPEAL!!!  It's about style, it's about truth, it's about hitting the open road and b!
eing different!  If I ever decide to buy a motorcycle, I think I'm gonna get a Harley!
