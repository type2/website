Subject: BN4 fuel pump

if you have an early BN4, it needs the special metering pump-it pumps a
measured squirt in with every stroke.  This is not compatible with the late
BN4s or any other fuel pump.  It is NLA, but there is a guy in Colorado who
has a few and quoted me $85 for a used one.

I traded my heater to John Baker for his '71, he fixed the fuel pump by
making a new diaphragm, but gave up on the unit, I think.

There is a good article in the library called &quot;BN4 demystified&quot; check it
out. . .

&gt;it's been in the teens the last couple nights here and I am thinking again
&gt;about that eberspa:cher BN4 with the bad fuel pump I have.   I remember
&gt;someone saying how you could order a new fuel pump from Espar (the current
&gt;incarnation of Eberspa:cher)for them.  It would be electric, not the same
&gt;kind as the original, but appropriate for the heater.   Anyone remember
what
&gt;the deal on that was?  I think the cost was about $30.
