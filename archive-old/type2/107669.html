Subject: Not sure I want the answer to this:(

Greetings. My '78 has 17,956.4 miles on a rebuild in '99 by a
list-recommended, reputable builder. Last year when tuning her, I couldn't get
the idle right and she wouldn't run if timed at 7.5 BTDC. Now a year later I
am cooled off and ready to objectively correct any/all problems.  I got her
running, but she won't idle on her own.  There is a sound, kinda like an
irregular muffled 'boom' that sounds like a teenager's thunderous stereo with
too much bass is 2 cars away with the windows up. That is my best description.
For S&amp;G's, I decided to do a compression check.  Engine warm, all plugs out,
accelerater depressed and screw-in tester showed:
#1 50
#2 70
#3 40
#4 55
Sickening.  My only ray of hope is that the bus hasn't ever really turned over
fast enough for my satisfaction-even with new bosch starter and Bosch low
voltage relay kit. The bus has never ever started on one try and has to crank
for several seconds to fire.   Now, with ZERO mechanics in my area willing to
touch a type4 fuel injected bus, I need some guidance that Bentley just does
not offer. Like what now? I kinda need a kind soul to email back and forth
with a check this/then that approach to get me thru this.  I can follow
Bentley, but need a guide. I realize this will take a while and I am patient.
Bentley just doesn't give an ORDER or methodology but instead says to rely on
your own hunch and I have none. My hunch is that this low-mileage pampered
engine should be good for another 60K!  Anyone up to this? Am I screwed with
those compression readings?
Thanks in advance!
Jay
