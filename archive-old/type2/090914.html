Subject: Re: [T2] remanufactured by vw/audi

I've seen a variety of VW Rebuilt labels on engines. 
In the events I've seen them it has meant very little.
Your engine may have been rebuilt several times after VW Refurb had it.
There are some tale tell signs on Type IVs, I don't know them all but one
is that the oil gallery ports behind the flywheel may have steel disks
nailed over the oil gallery port plugs. 
It appears to be something that was installed with an impact gun of
sorts.
I've also found VW refurb engines with the two front oil gallery plugs
Heli Arc welded over.
If it came as a long block check to see if it has VW OEM heads with the
VW Part numbers and VW OEM cylinders. 
Personally I don't think VW rebuild factory made an engine to rave about.
In my most recent disassembly of a Known To Have Been VW Factory rebuilt
(30K miles ago) I found main bearing locking pins missing, hydraulic
lifters about to fall apart (spring clip half gone), a couple of heli
coils in threads and a first oversize oil drain plug.
I'm not trying to kill any admiration you may hold for VW rebuilts but
they are just a factory like any other factory.

refurbished.
