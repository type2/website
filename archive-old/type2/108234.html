Subject: RE: [T2] tranny oil

Napa has it for 3.29 for a 32 oz. bottle.  I just picked some up the
other day and it is a normal stock item for most stores according to the
guy behind the counter.  Part # SL24229.  Buy a 17mm allen wrench to
remove the drain plug and fill plug as well.  Also get a little hand
pump to fill the tranny back up. It's only a few dollars and it will
save a lot of headache.
