I did some more listening to the engine.

#1)yes, it will run.
#2)the sound (chirp, like vaccum or pressure) alternates between
left/right of engine
#3)the sound is eliminated from the left side of the engine when I
remove the plugs from the left side

ok...  sources of input and output from the sides of the engine:

1)balance tube for air.  connects to &quot;master&quot; output on top of left
side carb.  connnects to top of left side manifold.  connects to top
of right side manifold

#2)&quot;balance&quot; tube for brake booster.  this is at the base of each
manifold, they are connected by metal tube.  brake booster connects to
this tube.

#3)EGR tube.  EGR isn't connected (crimped off before it goes to
exhaust).  This connects front(of car) of manifolds together, T to
exhaust is crimped

#4)EGR ?valves? on manifolds.  These are vacuum diaphragms on the
outer side of each manifold.

#5) bad seal between carb and manifold?  (on both sides?)

#6)bad seal between manifold and head? (both sides?)

Exhaust:  sounds like the sound is on top of the engine,
not on the bottom.



#7)exhaust output, exhaust leak.  two ports on bottom of each head.

Any ideas?  I think the sound may be tied to the manifolds and EGR
valves on the manifolds.
