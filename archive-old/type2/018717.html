Message-ID: &lt;377EBE09.366A_at_injersey_dot_com&gt;

&gt;tried to seal the sump up well with Permatex 3H
[...]
&gt;the thing leaks oil very badly.

&gt;Any suggestions?

Gordon:

If you're talking about the sump plate itself, it should have a rubber
O-ring seal between it and the case.

&gt;AVP, they seem to have used some type of silicone to seal it

Hmmmm ... maybe the rebuilder bashers should target AVP?
