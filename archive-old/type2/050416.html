Hmmmm,

Tie a cat to the bus. One in the engine room too. 

In all seriousness, check things out before you drive it. Jennifer smoked the motor in her '65 when some mice took up residence in her engine tin. Air did not flow, motor overheated, mice toasted - what a mess. This occurred while the bus was being driven regularly.

Shortly after getting my '67 bus I pulled the motor out for some odd and end work. I decided to hose all the road dirt out the engine room and do a bit of scrubbing. For those of you who don't know split screen buses do not have a firewall between the engine and the gas tank. When I was hosing out the gas tank area a HUGE mouse nest roared out from behind(in front of FIF) the gas tank. Yikes! A fully soaked nest. What could be move lovely ?

Mouse urine is acidic and will promote rust.

&gt; Good morning volks!

Tomorrow is the day for me to drive home my new '76 Westy and guess 
what?...I have a question.  The bus has been sitting on a wooded lot for 
about a year and has a family of mice living in it.
