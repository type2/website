Subject: Ball Joints and oil breather

Okay,
Number 1:
Should I or shouldn't I try to attempt to do my own BAll JOINTS?

It is extremely expensive.  Not just the parts...Getting quotes of 180.00 
for all four (german).  But Labor is rediculous...

What are the biggies to be aware of?

Number 2:
Oil breather on a t4 engine.._dot_can someone please explain the purpose of it?  
Don't want to sound dumb, but I want a technical point of view on it...?
Thanks!
Lo
