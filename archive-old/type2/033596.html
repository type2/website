Subject: Re: Seat upgrade

&gt;Ray, wish I could help you out with that question, but my experience is
&gt;limited to ' 75 and up busses and vanagons. It would think that the seat
&gt;tracks would be the same, but if not, it looks to me that you could modify
&gt;the seat rails on the late vanagon seats to fit your ' 68 tracks, or alter
&gt;the vanagon seats to accept the ' 68 rails and then slide ' em right in.
&gt;Sorry for the lack of useful info, Beckett


We have installed Vanagon front seats in our '72 Bus.  It does require
a little work, and a welder certainly is necessary.  For the passenger seat,
simply weld on some tabs to the sides of the tracks and bolt the tabs
through
the 'floor'.  Mount it far enough forward so you can fully recline the seat.

The driver's seat requires the use of the track from the bottom of the
original
Bus seat.  You can use the whole tube frame the rack is connected to, but
that
makes the new seat a bit higher than stock.  I'm only 5'9&quot; and my head was
almost touching the headliner.  A few months ago I re-did the seat and
removed
the tube frame, by welding the Bus rails directly to the bottom of the
Vanagon
seat.  You have to get it lined up correctly, but it brings the height of
the seat
back to normal.

We've also created a pair of living room seats out of another pair of
Vanagon front
seats.  A simple wooden base made out of scrap 2x6's keeps them stable and
they are very comfortable.
