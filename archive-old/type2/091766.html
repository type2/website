Subject: Re: [T2] ugly bus/van entry

As a bus it definately is strange...but i  like that paint job!!  I just 
noticed the plates....and enlarged that pic.  That type of  vehicle 
would have a extremely difficult time getting registered as a  driver in 
japan.   spent to many years there not to know that.  Those plates have 
the &quot;4&quot; pattern.  Corporate  show vehicle not for daily use.  Only for 
show  purposes like promos.  In this case probably  pokeman.  the van in 
the background is probably how that one started out.
