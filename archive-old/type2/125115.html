Subject: RE: [T2] NEW IMPROVED Poptop Canvas is Here!

&gt; Some time back I promised new Westfalia poptop canvas 
&gt; offerings.  After nearly a year of working on this, I am 
&gt; happy to announce that they finally arrived at The Bus Depot 
&gt; from Europe yesterday.


Someone asked me whether the list discount will apply to these. It does,
so actually the prices will be 5% lower than listed if you use referral
code list1e.
