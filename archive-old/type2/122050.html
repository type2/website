Subject: Re: [T2] ice on the inside

Hi James,

A really excellent way to warm up your bus is to use a hot-air corn 
popper. They run on 110V and give off a ton of heat.  The one I have at 
home has a removeable lid so the hot air stream is directed straight 
up.

Check your local junk-shop or garage sale, you should be able to pick 
one up quite cheap.

Happy trails,
