&amp;gt; AS you guys know, I'm all about the tire and oil
&amp;gt; FARTS.  However, I still don't have this worked
&amp;gt; out in my head.  If 10W30, 5W30, or 0W30 act the
&amp;gt; same as SAE30 at operating temp--which of course
&amp;gt; is almost all the time you have your engine
&amp;gt; running-- why is there a rush to lower viscosity
&amp;gt; base oil in the name of fuel economy?

Because the hot number used to be &amp;quot;40&amp;quot;, but now it is 30 or 20.  The cold
number gets correspondingly lower to improve mileage during warmup, which
is a significant portion of most vehicles' driving cycles.
