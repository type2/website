Subject: 15&quot; inch wheels

The Vanagon list archives have TONS of discussion about putting Mercedes and Audi rims on Vanagons. I know the bolt pattern is the same for late bay busses but don't know if there's a difference in offset. Audi rims need to center hole reamed out to fit correctly.

Several list vendors carry steel and alloy 15&quot; rims for the Vanagon for various prices. Vanagain_dot_com and Fast Forward (http://www.fastforward_dot_ca/) come to mind. A friend put 15&quot; steels on his 82 and loves them -- plenty of tire choices, but can't find hubcaps to fit. 16&quot; steels are also available, but check for clearance before sending the $$. IIRC they won't work on Vanagons unless you're driving a TriStar.
