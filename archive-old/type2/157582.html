My dad and and I. Yeah, that thought had crossed my mind. I don't recall us 
overly applying too much sealer, but it's possible. I suppose some could have 
squished out into the gallery...


&gt; I guess if there is a spec on end play, there are things that happen
&gt; when end-play is out of spec. Not sure if too tight means it will eat
&gt; the bearing though.

I'm just not sure if we got it right when we assembled the engine. I seem to 
recall that there was no endplay at all. Any movement we got in the guage was 
from warping the flywheel as we pushed and pulled on it...
