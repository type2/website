Subject: Re: Driving in the wind

I had the same problem with my 1979 bus and finally got around to adjusting 
the steering greabox play.
It had about 5cm either way at the rim of the wheel and I got it donw to 1cm 
or so.
It mad ***A LOT*** of difference to the handeling of the bus.
I am looking for an upgraded antiroll bar for the front at the moment.
The only sourceI have found so far is JUSTKAMPERS but they only sell it as a 
kit with air shocks which I don't want at the moment for 200 pounds which 
seems rather a lot.
Any one know where I can just get a stronger antiroll bag and harder 
fixtures?
Also what dampenres do people recommend?

Thanks

Lukas
