Subject: I for got to mark the wires

Volks,

Help, I forgot to mark the wires that go from the points and ECU to the
coil and now I can't remember if they go to the negative or posistive side
of the coil or if its one to each.  

Could someone help me....I'm ready to crank the thing except for this.

Thanks for your help.
