Subject: [T2] a Transvair is born

It's hard to explain, really. One minute yer having engine trouble with your
stock 1600cc, the next your shoe-horning a '65 Corvair engine and tranny
into the back of your bus. You wake up groggy, pop the engine lid and say
&quot;Dear God what have I done?&quot;

Well, that's what I done. Got a good deal on a rebuilt Corvair engine,
ordered up a kit from Clark's,and now I'm the proud owner of a Transvair,
which for ya'll not in the know is a TRANSporter powered by a corVAIR
engine. Guess you could call it a Corvporter or even a Vairbus. But I'll
stick with the accepted nomenclature.

Mine is a 65 110 sporting 95 hp heads, which allows you to run on lower
grade gas. So I figure that gives me right around 100 ponies to play with,
or roughly twice the power I was making with the 1600.

I fired her off today for the first time. Started right up, a little lifter
noise, then silence from the valve area. Yes, I like hydraulic valves. Got
dual carbies too. The shifter actually works better than the old VeeWee
tranny did, but I was in desparate need of some linkage work so the
comparison ain't really fair. The clutch is smooth as a baby's hind end, and
the thing has torque, torque, torque. Not neck-snapping accelartion -- more
like the unhurried, unharried composure of a car that doesn't have to sprint
to keep up with everything else on the road. I can see buzzing down the road
at 80 mph in this thing if I wanna. Don't wanna, but I could do it. And
that's the same reason people buy Porsche 911s that can go 180 mph.

I made every effort to keep the bus as stock as possible -- didn't cut any
sheetmetal at all. I had to fabricate some shrouds to fit around the flat
'vair engine, but it was easy. All in all a very simple, satisfying
conversion. I'm looking forward to my first passing lane adventure.

The old 1600 is going to get freshened up and stuffed in the back end of my
Ghia.

Don't flame me because I have horsepower.
