Subject: Re: Oil Strainer?

I usually clean and inspect the strainer and put in new gaskets every second
or third oil change. I started out doing it every time but didn't find
anything to worry me, so I extended the schedule. You can bet that the first
time I find troubling debris in there I'll go back to checking it every
change.

&gt; &gt; Should I be changing the oil strainer and gaskets with every oil/filter
&gt; &gt; change?  I've done so every time so far, but found nothing there of
&gt; &gt; concern.  Yes, I am aware of the wimpy torque spec and the need to
&gt; &gt; adhere to it.
&gt;
&gt; I just clean it out and use new gaskets. I don't find much either. I've
read the strainer isn't as fine mesh as the original anyway. I think you'll
find people on either side of the fence on this issue. Personally, I like to
know what's inside.
