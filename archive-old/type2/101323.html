&gt;Definitely fuse the line separately.

Make sure that you fuse very close to where you tap the power (battery
or starter). I would just use some sort of in-line fuse.

&gt;&gt;What style or fuse and what rating?

&gt;That's up to you.  You can get DC circuit breakers at West Marine but
they are not cheap (~$35).  You could also use a fuseable link,
available at Pep Boys.  I would look for &gt;something in the 30-50 amp
range.

What do you want 30-50 Amps for??? That would be 360 - 600 Watts. Even
if you go with 100 Watt high beams, 20 Amps should be plenty. The higher
your fuse is rated, the more likely you are to cause damage to your
wiring before it blows.
