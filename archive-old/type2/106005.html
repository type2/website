&lt;&lt;  So i just wanted to warn

&gt; the rest of you and i hope someone has some tips for me to stop this from 

&gt; happening.  Thanks.

Pretty sure J.C. Whitney/Pep Boys/etc. sell a blinking LED fake alarm
light that looks like you've got an anti theft system. A real alarm 
might stop someone from stealing the Bus but probably not an am-
atuer thief who's willing to smash the window and take something
quick...:-(
