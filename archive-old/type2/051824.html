Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel injector bracket???

[...]

&gt; I pulled my injectors out of my 1980 vanagon 2.0L. I bought new ones, but,
&gt; they have a metal ring that holds them onto intake manifold. I tried to
&gt; remove it to get them ready to put on the new ones but they cannot come
off
&gt; without destroying the plastic electical connection of the injector.

&gt; Do the new ones come with this metal piece on them or is this another VW
&gt; puzzle I have to seek help on???

Easy. Take a little screwdriver and walk the black rubber ring off the
bottom. Then the bracket falls off.....
