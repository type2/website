Hello Greg:

I used the quick-n-easy brackets with 2X4 crossbars on my westy.  It
took a couple of extra 2X4 spacers to clear the westy top but they work
great even with 2 canoes.  You can get the brackets at Natahala Outdoor
Center &lt;www.noc_dot_com&gt; for ~$50.

good luck 
Shawn Clark

&gt; Hello list members,
&gt;     I was looking into getting a pair of Thule roof racks for my bus.
&gt; This is because I want to be able to carry a one man outrigger canoe on
&gt; top of my bus.  Wow these are expensive!  Anyone want to recommend a
&gt; place to buy them or a another brand?  Much appreciated.
&gt;
