Subject: Re: [T2] cylinder head cc's

&gt;That sounds rather large for a stock combustion chamber - I had what I
thought was a stock set of 1800 heads and they measured 51cc.  The head
with the step has not been milled - they came that way from the factory.
You need both heads to match so
&gt;machining the step out is probably your best option.

Does the 1.8 come with a step?  The 1700 and 2.0's surely come flat as hell
unless they are an AMC replacement head.  For 1700's and 2.0s like David says
stock volume is usually 51-52 cc's, it takes fair amount of carving to get
em up
to 55-56 without step cutting.  And most rebuilders only cut the step to make
up for losses flycutting the surface, only with the AMC heads did you get
much real addition to the volume and on 2.0's still not much more than 53cc.

&gt;&gt;I have 1.8L carb engine with 92.98 pistons,dished pistons, and I do not know
&gt;&gt;my deck height right now,, is that standard,, or should I measure it,
&gt;
&gt;Measure it.  Mine was shy of Wilson's spec by a few thou for some reason.

Deck heights vary significantly, and even SIDE TO SIDE in the same engine
even when the rods are all perfectly matched length.  The one running around
in Dolans machine right now was 0.017&quot; off side to side, and the prior major
CA rebuilder (still in business) apparently didn't bother to notice it.
The one
I just built was 0.005 side to side, more like a normal case.  The decks were
0.017 and 0.022 BTW, I've never seen a deck on a 2.0 come out over 0.035.
Wilson's info like so much of his stuff is T1 info.  Of course the T4 also
uses
the 0.009 or so metal shim, and a 0.030 head gasket, or if you prefer to
follow
the VW rebuild instructions a 0.060 shim with deletion of the other two.
Another
thing to note is for my upcoming build article I tried a few comparison
methods
of measuring deck, my gold standard a 2&quot; aluminum torque plate and dial gage,
a depth mic, a vernier caliper used in the depth mode, and the feeler gage
method
Wilson proposes.  On said 0.017 and 0.022 established with the plate and dial
gage I got respectively 0.018, 0.023 with the depth mic, 0.020, 0.025 with the
vernier, and 0.021, 0.027 with the feeler stuff.  Those 3 methods were all
clamped
the same way with 3/8&quot; npt pipes ground to seat on the lip on the barrel,
not just
on the fins, far tighter than Wilson's &quot;stack some sockets method&quot; and were
still fairly inaccurate.  To do it on the cheap, clamp it across with a
piece of
heavy steel strap (1/4&quot; at least) that crosses the barrel and is drilled for 2
diagonally opposite studs.  Then buy a $15 depth mic set from Enco and
your results will be pretty good.  This isn't trivial stuff, particularly
if you've gone
to all the trouble to match the heads if you don't clamp the barrels
sufficiently
when you measure the deck you'll get crap readings, and 1.8 and 2.0's are
about
7cc/mm so a .005 difference is about .8cc or so.

&gt;Yes.  I seem to remember the 2-liter dish as being 15cc but I think the
1.8 dish is much smaller - maybe 5cc?

I know the 2.0 is 15-16 depending if they are Mahle or KS, and the 1.7 is much
less.  I've never seen a set of 1.8's.
