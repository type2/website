Hola, everyone...
We have just returned from our 2,910 mile round trip to the Mexico mainland
and Baja California...It's good to be back &amp; we missed the List - but we had
some great warm days on the beach, too!!!...

Heres our trip data:

73 Westy, stock 1700 with single 2BBL Weber  and electronic points - about
15K on and engine rebuild - 140K on the chassis...we carried a roof rack
with a 2nd spare tire on top and a 5 gal gas bottle...also carried some
luggage during first hald of trip:

Left Stockton, CA on Sunday Feb 14th - to:
San Luis Obispo (our son's college town) - Los Angeles - San Bernardino -
Phoenix (picked up our new top slider for the Westy roof hole from 'Street
Beat')-Tuscon - Nogales/Nogales, Mx - Guaymas/San Carlos....1,300 trip miles
with an avg MPG of: 17.48...we tried to keep the RPM's in the 3200 - 3700
range and the speed around 60-65 MPH...boy do those trucks give off the
blow-by on those Arizona freeways!

On Feb 23rd, we took the Ferry boat from Guaymas to Santa Rosalia in Baja -
(a real fun 'ride' - if anyone wants more details, email me direct &amp; I'll
return my trip details) -
Santa Rosalia - Mulege - Bahia de Concepcion - local area touring, etc ...
Feb 27th, left for: Mulege - Santa Rosalia - north on Baja hwy 1 to
Ensenada - TJ - San Diego - Los Angeles - San Luis Obispo - Stockton/Home on
Mar 4th....1610 trip miles with avg.  MPG of 15.05...tried to keep same
speed range as above, but had more mountains to cover, and lots of head
winds from LA, all the way home to northern Calif.

Total miles:  2910 with total avg MPG of 15.87...we used 183 gallons and our
total exp was $245...gas was cheapest in Arizona, with some $.87/gal and the
most expensive in Mexico where it's all priced the same at about $1.72/gal!

That's all for now,  Hasta la bye bye.
Ray &amp; Pat Cellar
