&gt; Great idea. Do you know if this is the same relay that fits a '70? My

I don't think the problem is the same, since your relays aren't plugged
into the fuse block like mine.

I've had to fix a couple of broken wires in the turn signal/dimmer switch
and I agreethat it's a trial.  I don't know about replacements, though.
