Subject: Brake Servo Hose
Message-ID: &lt;372D1241.69F8B32B_at_dolphinsci_dot_com&gt;

I pulled a brake servo out of a '78 bus in a junk yard and have a
question about one of the hoses that attached to it.  One hose attaches
to the metal servo unit and that is for the vacuum.  The other attaches
in the front where the brake lever push rod attaches to the unit.  The
hose winds up and into the body and disappears into the door pillar.  I
have looked through my bentley and cannot find any reference to this
tube other than showing it.

What is it for?
Where does it go?

I ask these questions as the disk brakes and servo are going on my '60
bus and I want to make sure that I have all the parts properly
installed.

Thanks

Scott
