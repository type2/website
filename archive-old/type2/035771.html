I've thought about two ways to insulate/cover this hole in my Dormobile
since that draft on the back of my neck when it's -20f is a PITA.
First, with the canvas cover, one could sew some sort of loops or velcro
straps to hang the middle of the cover from the inside roof top.  My
dormobile has big handles and vent handles to hang such things from, this
would prevent the sag.  I don't know about the westy tops.
second thought was to place the rear bed cushion accross the hole, pinning
it in with the roof.  I don't know how else to describe that process but it
would leave the back third or so uncovered, a guy could adapt more foam for
that purpose I suppose,
thoughts and criticisms accepted.
