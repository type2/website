Subject: Re: [T2] Those with Kadrons - edit

&gt; I've always had a smaller set of mains and idles with me in those
&gt; situations


I should amend my glaring inaccuracy, I have not yet actually ever  
HAD to drive with Kadrons to sea level and never had to put in larger  
OR smaller jets to accommodate but this should read &quot;Larger &amp; Smaller  
set of mains and idles&quot;.

thanks !
