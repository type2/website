Subject: Re: [T2] Air and water

&gt; I'd never heard of an aircooled Fox. But the origin of the Fox is not
&gt; Brazilian.

Could this thread (Air Vs Water Foxes) be due to a simple misunderstanding?
When I read the first post about the auto transmission, I asked myself if the
air cooled mention was about the engine or the transmission.  Thinking about it,
it might just be that VW was using the aircooled auto trans across platforms.
