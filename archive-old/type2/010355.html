&gt;There is no automotive manufacturer in the world today that has not
&gt;paid&gt;license &gt;fees &gt;to Porsche Design for designs that can't be beat.
Yes, even the 
&gt;Japanese,&gt;who have some&gt;very non Western ideas about patent rights, hire
&gt;Porsche Design to &gt;solve&gt;best the&gt;problems their method can't. 


And Porche pays licensing rights to Mitsubishi fo those &quot;balance shafts&quot;
on the 944 engines.  

&gt;I wholeheartaly agree. Even when I service a relative's Ford truck, I
buy
&gt;FOMOCO parts and follow their manual as a guide in applying the Methode.
&gt;If those FOMOCO belts lasted 6 years and 60,000 miles you would be penny
&gt;smart and pound foolish to put on Gates wannabes.

I second that too!  I buy a lot of aftermarrket parts but for a timing
belts (for my H*nda) and such, I'll  buy a factory part.   And while the
VW dealer price may be ridiculous for a Westy canvas top ($1,200), I have
also been pleasantly suprised often too.  Like how about a type 4
flywheel washer (the one with all the bolt holes) for approx $4.00 - in
one day -  with no shipping charges!  A true bargain, especially when the
aftermarket primarily has them only in a gasket kits.
