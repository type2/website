Subject: Re: [T2] speedo working but Odometer does not change!

&gt; I bought a 73 thing to get going, as if I do not have enough vehicles. It 
&gt; has a speedo that shows the speed (after replacing the grease cap with a
&gt; square 
&gt; hole, instead of a round hole) but the odometer does not change. Is this 
&gt; probably the same problem.
&gt;
&gt;    There's a Thing sittin' in a gas station that I pass occasionally, with a
4
sale sign on it. I casually checked it out and even without checkin' out
the mechanicals, I'm sure the only thing holdin' it off the ground is the
paint... The Thing's the Poster Car for Rust, Inc... ;-(
