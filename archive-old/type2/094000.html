&gt; Thanks to those who replied to the following :
&gt; I thought this problem might be the tranny ground strap......but it is
&gt;&gt; connected
&gt;&gt; She will start with a jump start and run good and drive good she will
&gt;&gt; even
&gt;&gt; start without cables for a minute after i shut her off but iff i try to
&gt;&gt; start her three minutes later i get nothing. What is going on with my
&gt;&gt; baby????
