Subject: The Dormobile and the last couple months

Hey Y'all
The Dormobile's rolling and running and stopping now!  I won't go into
the engine building gig much except to say that my wife did most of it
and a fine job she did!  There so many threads on building engines I
figure there isn't much we can add.  First tank of gas revealed an
average of 25 mpg, and that while doing the ring seating deal (speed up
slow down speed up slow down - sux if you're prone to motion sickness).

The only things I might say is don't let CB Performance do your machine
work.  I ended up with different deck heights on the case and different
combustion chamber volumes because of their machine shop.  Fortunately
Sherry was able to compensate, thanks to Whitey in NC.

The brakes saga has been the most recent deal.  I had all the brake
hardware waiting to go when Chet needed brake hardware.  He needed it
more than I did so I set him up with brakes (kinda important on long
trips).  I forgot precisely what I gave him and so ended up with 4 left
front wheel cylinders and no right front.  An easy fix though I hate
waiting for parts I thought I already had.  The now can howl the tires
if I want to and she stops fairly well.

As far as driveability, I've been driving the Tinkertoy almost
exclusively for 2 years.  Bays drive a whole lot different.  Doesn't
have the turn radius.  Shifts easier, and wallows more.  I think shocks
will help the wallows.

This weekend is gut the interior, lay the floor, glue the delaminated
cabinetry, and install new window seal behind the suicide cabinet.
Wonder what I'll do Sunday ;) !!

Mostly I want to thank all the listees who gave advice when asked (and
sometimes when not).  Thank you to my most patient and understanding and
talented wife, Sherry who can build one rippin' engine!  My long
suffering kids who put up with engine building in the kitchen and living
room.  Thanks to Doc Woosley, Derek, and Pauly at Woosley's garage in
Charleston. Doc's been wrenching on VWs for many years and often advised
me by asking the right questions, and told me when I was on the right
track.  Thanks to the entire Full Moon Bus Club for their support and
help.

Damn I thought I was doing this almost alone too!

Chet, if you're out there howya doing?

Dave
