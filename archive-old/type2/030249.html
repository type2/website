&gt; Got a tricky adjusting star, and have tried everything
&gt; I can think of, PB Blaster, banging it one way, then
&gt; the other, heat, torquing in the adjusting screw to
&gt; try and force it out.  My buddy broke the retaining
&gt; clips off of his '78 so he could get on them with
&gt; vise-grips, but I'd like to avoid that.  Is there some
&gt; magical remedy that I'm missing?  BTW, I'm only
&gt; heating it with a propane pencil torch.

Get a bolt longer than the adjusting bolt with the same thread.  Take out
the adjusting bolt and stuff the hole full of grease.  Thread the long
bolt in and one of two things will likely happen:

1. The hydraulic pressure in the grease will push the adjuster out.
2. The bolt will bottom and continued torqueing will push the adjuster
out.
