I am wondering what the resistance of the AFM(#6 &amp; #27) was at  68 degrees.
Should be from 2100 to 2900  ohms.  It might be possible to put another
resistor on this to compensate.

Have fun

&gt;I have been having trouble with my 77 westy recently (2.0L FI).  And had
&gt;traced it to the AFM.  I tested the resistance for the temp sensor 1 (in the
&gt;AFM) and it was below the specifications.
