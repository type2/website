Subject: CD Engine code?? Any info

Me and a friend are putting together a 72 westy for
him, he has an engine which the PO thought was a 1700
from a different 72. It has a &quot;CD&quot; engine code and I
cannot seem to find this code in any of my manuals or
online. Can anyone confirm that this &quot;CD&quot; engine is or
is not a 1700??
