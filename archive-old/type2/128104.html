Subject: Re: [T2] AIRS UPDATES: (Was Re: [T2] Hi all - long)

I sent a pmail to Greg about this yesterday. I have access to US
landline directory assistance data as a part of my job. Whether the use
of that access for validating phone numbers is legal is a question that
I can't really answer. I figure if we sell the data for that purpose, I
can too, so, I validated the numbers for Oregon and Washington by hand.

When I first started to look into this, I hadn't looked at the AIRS
list. I foolishly thought that I could easily download the entire list
and validate the whole thing en masse. Clearly, that's not possible. I
did 2 states to see if the output was valuable. Now that I've done it,
though, I don't know what to do with my results. Any ideas?

&gt; &gt; This topic reminds me of a campfire conversation at the Dixie Bus
&gt; &gt; Gathering.... Someone there had need of the AIRS list only to
&gt; discover
&gt; &gt; that about 80% of the phone numbers or email addresses in the state
&gt; &gt; they were in were no longer active.
&gt; 
&gt; I tried to get this started well over a year ago after being
&gt; contacted by
&gt; a wayward traveller and being told how much trouble they had with the
&gt; info.
&gt; I contacted Wade several times and started verifying all of the
&gt; Florida
&gt; contacts. I felt we needed to get volunteers in each state to verify
&gt; and
&gt; then update the lists. I emailed first and tried to phone those who
&gt; didnt
&gt; respond.
&gt; Maybe someone else needs to administer the Airs list. I tried but
&gt; couldnt
&gt; seem to get Wade to do much about it.
