Subject: RE: por 15 primer report

OK i'm a dealer for POR-15 products and i use it too, the product catalog 
recomends using the base por15 first ,,( either gloss black ,silver,gray,or 
clear,or semi,) then apply the tie-coat primer ,,i have not used the primer 
yet myself but i'm reading it from my catalog as i type ,,any of it works 
better if sprayed ,,just rember the smell i rough ,(i wear a respirator ) and 
gloves ,,it don't wash off it wears off ,,( don't ask how i know ,but i do ) 
i figure the regular will probably make the primer go on easier ,,later
