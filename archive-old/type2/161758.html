Subject: RE: [T2] It's not how good you are with a welder...

We have one of those welders (and it was 99 when Jackie bought it) and 
Jackie can actually get good beads out of it, but as I am not as proficient, 
the rig I use helps alot.  I also found if you preheat the material it seems 
to weld better.  Maybe it's just me.
