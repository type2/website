Subject: RE: [T2] Failed rocker arm stud

Hi Folks,

It's interesting that you mention this, since I had a rocker shaft pull out 
on me as well.  The first time it was a bad stud that sheared.  The second 
time it was a stuck valve that put a lot of stress on the rocker assembly.  
In that case, I'm glad the stud pulled out and saved the piston from getting 
a valve thru its top.

Hot heads and a too-high CR sound like the perfect recipe for disaster!

Good Luck...
