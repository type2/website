Ever since I got my type IV engine running it has been going thru alt
belts about every 3 months. The belts wear along the rear facing edge
and get loose. Now I did use parts from 2 different engines, one had
AC, and mixed and matched parts to get the best ones. After consulting
the archives on belts a feeble light bulb came on in my head. Are some
of the parts, mainly the fan hub flange different on cars with and
without AC. My reasoning is this: AC engines have that funky pully
between the fan and hub which must space  out the fan away from the
engine some. This would cause some mis-alingment between the fan pully
and the alt pully. The point is that I did not put the pully in. Anyone
know about this?

When you're crusing down the road in the fast lane and you lazily sail past a few hard-driving cars and are feeling pretty pleased with yourself and then accidentally change down from forth to first instead of third thus making your engine leap out of your hood in a rather ugly mess it tends to throw you off your stride....
