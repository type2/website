Nope. Not true. Doesn't sound like much of a bus mechanic.
If the correct manifold is with the weber, there should be a big 1/2&quot; nipple sticking out of the base of it or at least a hole for one - thats your vacuum feed for the booster.

If you don't have the nipple or the hole, you or he or somebodee can drill and tap the manifold and install a vacuum fitting - you want about a 1/2&quot; inside diameter on whatever fitting you install.
