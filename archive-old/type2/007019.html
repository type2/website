Subject:      Spark Plugs...a question...
Comments: To: Vintage VW &lt;vintagvw_at_sjsuvm1.sjsu_dot_edu&gt;

looking back to the other day, when i was flipping through my official
service manual for my bus...
(and now to modern day! started this message 2 days ago..but havent found
my book to refer too till a litle while ago..:) so here we go..

So..as the subject reads...i got wondering about spark plugs.

Now, used to i would just go to my FLAPS and say &quot;gimma bosch super's for
&lt;insert  vw here&gt;&quot; and i'd use that...(tried plat.s but had lotsa carbon
build up trouble...)

so..thinking..(wow!)
read hoover's sermon on CDI, and he mentions the ability to use a larger
plug gap..(!) now..this would alow more fire, better performance, right?

so, what do you folk's with them big ol' engines do? use stock gap? stock
plugs? how do you figure the heat range you otta use? and the gap? am i
nuts to even consider this very important part of the ignition system as
being tailorable to the enigne?

on a similar line...valve lash..for you hi-performancers again..say your
using non-stock cams, lifters, pushy rods (what you say? you mean these
cute chrome jobies?), rocker's, and maybe even them big valves...

now..since this stuff's metallic properies were not figured into VW
(orMuir or Bentley for that matter)'s original design of metal expansion
due to heat, which would, in my mind change what the overall gap should
be...right? (and then...those w/ the nonstock blocks...and i mean the
real megabuck jobies...that would change other things too...right?)


ok..back to the origional thought...

on a stock B engine...(at least, a bus B engine..) its a 1584 singleport..

now..listed in the spec's for it, in the offical vw service manual, are
two different sets of plugs...i'll use Bosch as the reference, but they
list other's too..

&quot;Normal Service: Bosch W 145 T1&quot;
&quot;High Speed Service: Bosch W175 T1&quot;

difference? i assume it has to due with this mystery &quot;heat range&quot; that
you rarely hear anyone talk about, but what is that?

and then...what do they consider &quot;High Speed Service&quot;? a quick 15minute
lube-n-tune? why would one set be quicker than the other to change?
(ok..ok...i'm stretching it a bit..:)

(just to stick more numbers here....)SAE horses for this B engine: 57_at_4400RPM
and SAE torque: 81.7 ft.lb_at_3000.....



oh! and another one for you high performers...timing! of course you dont
go by the book timeing for your year car..:) i assume you just do it by
ear till you find what works best...(by ear..not by sound or feel, but by
which degree runs coolest, strongest, and witht he best gasmilage...:)

so...in summery..what is high speed service?

with a hotter fireing CDI, i could open my plugs more, but how would i
know how far? and just what difference would it really make? do any of us
know?

plus what ever else i happened to ask about...

(flipping the page)
oh yeah...

they list for oil pressure...
&quot;Oil pressure (for SAE 30 only) at an oil temp of 70deg C (158deg F) and
2500 rpm:  ~ 3kg/cm^2  (42psi)&quot;

so...where is that oil temp messured? sump? prepump? postpump? where?:)

and, could we assume this to be a &quot;normal&quot; operating temp to shoot for?
at least, when running around 2500 rpm?

and maybe lower for higher speed, since the inscreased airflow...


(now..i know mike West will have good stuff to say..but i wanna here from
the rest of ya too!!!:)



....david....
