&gt; I have a '72 Transporter with a 1700cc pancake. I just put in a

&gt; seems
&gt; to cause me any alarm but when I reach cruising speed of about 65mph I
&gt; am registering my rpms at about 3800. Does this seem a little high or
&gt; within an acceptable range. I know that on my non-VW vehicle. I need to
&gt; be in excess of 80mph before I even hit 3000 rpms. Any thoughts? Any I
&gt; potentially causing any harm at such a high rpm?

Nope, that's about right.  Remember, we only have 4-speed
transmissions, and they're geared to allow that 67 Eichhvrnchenstdrken
engine to scoot the thing along.

If you're really worried about it, have a taller 4th gear put in next
time you do a transmission rebuild... but then you have to worry about
the gap between 3rd and 4th being a little wider, meaning that you
might be running high RPMs in 3rd or lugging in 4th in some driving
conditions (do much 45MPH driving?)
