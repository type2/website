Subject: N O S ???

Any suggestions on determining whether or not a part is in fact N.O.S.?? I have aquired an engine case (CB code) which appears to be NOS.  However, I do not know this for a fact. I would like to sell the thing but I don't want to advertise it as NOS if it is not. It looks unused, no oil anywhere only dust from sitting. It has a VW logo on it and the code number. The engine code is on it in 2 places. It has the code molded into the  metal on the rear and also it is stamped with some sort of purple ink near where I believe the oil cooler will go (Sorry, but I'm not familiar with T4 engines).  Any other clues I need to look for to determine if it is NOS?  Would it be a deceiving for sale ad if i listed it as &quot;APPEARS to be N.O.S.?
Thanks &amp; PEACE! John Baker

Peace, John Baker
