Hi Volks!

&gt; Are there any listees in Frankfort? I'd very much enjoy the opportunity to
&gt; meet someone familiar with the bus scene there. Also...what VW sites should
&gt; I visit during my free time?
&gt; I'll be arriving on a Sunday and staying 2 - 3 days.

Salzgitter is a ways from Frankfurt, both ones actually [1],
but I'd like to mention the VW Bus Museum anyway.  Located
in Salzgitter-Gebhardshagen, open Sat 12-6 and Sun 11-6.
Salzgitter is roughly in the centre bettween Hannover,
Wolfsburg, and Goslar, or about 30 kilometres to the 
South-West from Braunschweig.

If you can't manage to make it there on the weekend, holler.
We certainly can arrange an opening by appointment for
you.

No English site nor pictures yet.  Thank God I'm not their 
Webmaster anymore, I'd have to take the blame then.

Don't expect too much, though, it isn't even remotely grand.
It's a small, hobbyist thing, about a dozen buses or so,
but certainly more interesting than Wolfsburg AutoMuseum 
at least for Baywindow drivers... I think.

But then I'm biased.

[1] There's a Frankfurt/Main 350 kilometres to the
    South-West, and a Frankfurt/Oder about as
    far to the East from Salzgitter.  I'm assuming 
    the former is your &quot;Frankfort&quot;. :-)

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
