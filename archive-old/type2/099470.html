&gt;I was hoping to find a couple of books that could teach me in plain

&gt;rust by welding in new panels, fix dents, and generally prepare a vehicle 
&gt;body for painting.

My advice would be to take a night class at your local voc.-tech. or 
community college.
It's really not a book-learning kind of thing.  To answer your question, 
though, here are
the books I have:

Chilton Auto Body Repair--Chilton

MIG Welding Handbook--L-TEC Welding Systems
The Oxy-Acetylene Handbook--The Esab Group, Inc.
Welder's Handbook--HP Books

The last one gives a great overview.  Get ahold of it first.  Then, find a 
class.
