Subject: Re: [T2] towing weights?

&gt;Trailer weight for my 78 is 2645lbs with trailer brakes!
&gt;without brakes is 1322 lbs.

I've towed Beetles over the mountains, 8x10 foot trailers of logs, loads of 
rock on same trailer, etc.

Do NOT get the trailer whipping back and forth, use electric or surge 
brakes on your trailer, and really drive like you expect your vehicle 
brakes to overheat on every hill.

I've towed alot of weight with my CR-V and it is seriously underbraked for 
heavy loads. Brakes get hot and rumble coming down the mountain.

Understand that these are TN mountains and not quite what I've seen in the 
pictures of mountains out west.
