Dunno about baywindows, but VW recomments using sealant on splitty
windshields, even tells you which kind of VW sealant to use.  When my 71
needs a windshield it will have sealant... Probably roofing tar, easy to
clean up, reseals when it gets heated up, cheap.

&gt; Finally, You suggest using a sealant, while Tommy from VW restorations
&gt; suggests using solicone lube to make it easy to get it in.  Seems to me
&gt; (Tommy are you listening?) that the lube and the sealant aren't going to
&gt; work together.  That was my thought anyways.

I personally wouldnt put silicone within 50 feet of my paint, that stuff
will make repainting next to impossible, it just seems to chemically bond
with paint and metal and whatever else it touches guranteeing that you
will never paint that area again without fisheyes galore!

Use glycerine as a lubricant.  Works great, and doesnt mess with paint.

take care,

Steve
