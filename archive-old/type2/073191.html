Subject: Re: Shipping Parts


This comes up sometimes but I don't recall that anybody has ever dealt with
it (I shall not address its relation, the &quot;how do I ship a car
cross-country&quot; question, here):

Common freight fares are similar to air passenger fares in that there are
&quot;published rates&quot; that nobody ever pays because they are ludicrous, and
then there are various levels of discount. Judging from your questions you
have no access to a loading dock or somebody who has an account with a
trucking company. This should not be such a huge obstacle but in the real
world I'm afraid no carrier is going to fool with you.

It's probably best to break it up into UPS-sized chunks. I don't remember
their limit, something like 85 lbs. Make five of them, it's really the
cheapest most reliable way to do these things.

&gt;I have some parts I need to ship to the East coast, and was wondering if
&gt;anyone has experience in this area.  The weight is 300 to 400 pounds so I
&gt;think it must be sent by truck.  What would it cost?  What company should I
&gt;use.  What else would I know prior to sending?
