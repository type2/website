seeings how i dont have a tv to smash, and im not going to cut my self off
from you all by smashing my computer,  i did have an outlet a coupple months

a TV in a junkyard.   and it was in a VW bug 



































                                                                         (see

it is hard to smash a TV  a simple ball peen hammer  did not do the trick.
 funny enough, my friend tried to talk me out of it.  wierd, as he was
actually WEARING a smash your televison t shirt.   so i talked him into it.
  it took throwinf an huge rock to smash that thing.
