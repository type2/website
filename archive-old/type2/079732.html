Subject: Re: [T2] Engine replacement (long)


&gt; Hi,
&gt; What is the advantage of the hydraulic lifters?
&gt; I am pondering the same rebuild/replace questions and I, too, have the
Weber
&gt; progressive carb with 1700cc engine. BTW, I just plugged up the smog pump
&gt; ports as my bus no longer had this pump installed.
&gt; I believe AVP sells this without the smog pump ports.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for any suggestions.
&gt; Tom, M.C.III.O.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; One more thing I should probably already know:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My engine is a 1700, no smog, carbs. I know the engines are pretty much
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; same, except in 78/79 the different exhaust. (I think)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Assuming I get a rebuilt from AVP, can I just order an 1800 engine, even
&gt; &gt; though it has the holes in the head and is made for a smog pump? Do we
&gt; just
&gt; &gt; plug the holes? Would it be smarter to just get the exact same 1700
&gt; engine?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I was also looking at the 2000cc long block with hydraulic lifters.
Seems
&gt; &gt; like a lot of people (including Boston Bob) think thats the way to go.
&gt; What
&gt; &gt; besides the exhaust would I have to get/change?
&gt; &gt; http://www.avp-worldwide_dot_com/engines.htm
&gt; &gt; I have been reading the archives on hydraulic lifters and I wonder if
&gt; &gt; getting a rebuilt cam and lifters is ok or should I try to get new ones
&gt; put
&gt; &gt; in?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Whats the difference between a 78 and 79 engine?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks for so much help!!!

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Ok   I am going to try and decipher what Bob said. Apparently its not
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; jetting (although I have heard thats wrong too), but rather the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;progressive&quot; part. When at idle only one bbl feeds the gas, but as
you
&gt; &gt; &gt; accelerate then they both do. He is saying that wears out your engine.
&gt; He
&gt; &gt; &gt; suggests retrofitting fuel injection (and tranny, etc.) from a 79 bus.
&gt; He
&gt; &gt; &gt; will warrant with dual carbs. He doesn't recommend the progressive
weber
&gt; &gt; &gt; though. Here is a pic of my centermount weber:
&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.72camper_dot_com/spiff12.jpg which is so readily available and
&gt; much
&gt; &gt; &gt; more affordable even at around $300. I have seen many buses with this
&gt; &gt; setup,
&gt; &gt; &gt; but I think I will switch, especially with 0 miles on a new rebuilt.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Hope I got that right.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Boston Bob ... doesn't give a warranty for an
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; engine with the weber carb on it. ...At the least I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would need new dual carbs for a warranty.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He won't warrant an engine with a weber progressive or
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; any weber?  Will warrant Dellortos?  New dual carbs
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; means stock or any dual carbs?  I thought all
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; aftermarket carbs were jetted wrong for VW
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; applications and need to be properly jetted.  Is the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; progressive completely incapable of being jetted
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; properly?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
