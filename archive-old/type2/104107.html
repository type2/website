&gt; My understanding of the term &quot;doghouse&quot; is that it refers to the large 
&gt; cooling shroud fitted on top of the engine to house the fan at the back 
&gt; of the generator/alternator on type 1 engines. This is a common usage 
&gt; with the many type1 engine users I know, most of whom have buses 
&gt; without the 71's oil cooler. If this practice varies by region, it's 
&gt; news to me.

pre-71 upright engines have a cooling shroud which, if viewed from the 
top, is rectangular, with the &quot;XXXX&quot; being the oil cooler:

	FIF
==========================
XXXX
==========================
	RIR

&quot;doghouse&quot; refers to the 1971 fanhouse, which removes the oil cooler 
to an isolated outcropping attached to the back of the fan housing:

=====
XXXX|	FIF
==========================

==========================
	RIR


The oil cooler being &quot;in the doghouse&quot;.  This results in separate cooling 
air going to the oil-cooler than the 3/4 head.  Unfortunately, the 
oil-cooler outlet still blows over the #3 head, but this still ends up 
being better for cooling.

&gt; BTW, I've had a 72, 73 and 74 type4 engined westy and ALL of them have 
&gt; had paper hoses from the blower to the heater boxes. I've seen plastic 
&gt; hoses on FI buses but never on a carbureted bus. YMMV.

I don't mean this to sound like a &quot;Well, MINE has...&quot;, but:

my 1971 carbureted bus has paper/??? hoses with a plastic, accordian-like 
housing *around* it, between the paper hoses and the heater boxes.  
Then again, my bus is pre-blower, so things might have changed then...
