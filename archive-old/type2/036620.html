Subject: Full width bed questions

We had a 72 Westfalia Hardtop with a full width bed which we bought new in
Monterey California. It had the curtains, upper cabinet across the way back
with an oval door and latch on it, screens, jalousie windows, standard
yellowish vinyl upholstery in the back, tan standard upholstery in the
front, birch panelling, kids cot across the front, table, light over the
table and little stool. It did not have the jump seat behind the driver, the
icebox/sink cabinet, cabinet door under the z-bed, electrical outlet or the
snap-on screen for the back window. The area where the jump seat and sink
usually are was panelled with the birch. It was Westfalia built and came
from the factory this way. Ours was Sierra Yellow (sort of gold color). but
much stripped down. I've seen a couple like it down through the years, and
they were either Sierra Yellow or white and, I think, 72s.
