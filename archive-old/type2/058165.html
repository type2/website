    Well, I used to live on the border, went into Canada quite often for
parts for heavy equipment (they were much cheaper) and got my entire car
torn apart one day because I had a SOF magazine laying on the front
seat, threatened with arrest for &quot;smuggling illegal literature&quot;, and
interrogated for several hours. 
   A friend of mine who was US Border Patrol said the Canucks were all
like that -- all they cared about in the group training sessions was how
to catch US citizens with guns.
