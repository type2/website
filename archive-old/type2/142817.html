Subject: Intake manifold leaks...

Ya'll may remember my discovery that my intake manifold nuts were
loose on the left manifold when I was pulling everything to put the
fuel tank in. It explained a few issues I'd been having. I made new
paper gaskets and put everything back together. Sweetness. =)

Yesterday I drove from my house to the Garden of the Gods in Colorado
Springs. About 50 miles or so of ups and downs. Started at 5400 ft (my
place) up to 7400 ft twice and as low as 3000 ft. A rough run for most
cars anyway. Pics taken with my digicam yesterday can be found here:
http://www.donimages_dot_com/pics/Colorado/ None of the film is back yet
from my medium format or 35mm rigs.

I took that run doing 75-ish both ways. Slower on some climbs though
never below 50 (3rd.. I love taller tires, I never went over 4400rpm).
Everything went beautifully! Ran like a dream.

After I got back I ran some errands. Suddenly the bus wouldn't idle
for squat and had a serious lack of power. I was really tired so I
just finished my errands and went home. Didn't get back to it until
today.

Valves still fine, no adjustment needed. All vacuum lines in place and
sealed. Fuel filter clean. I decided to double check the torque on the
intake nuts.

Doh!

All 8 of 'em were loose! I torqued to 15ftlbs (didn't look up the
spec. Probably should..hehe) when I installed them. Either I suck at
torque or they worked themselves loose. No biggie. Retorqued them. One
stud is backing itself out. I tightened it as well as I dared without
pulling everything back apart. It's sealed, but I couldn't get over 10
ftlbs. Left it for now.

Guess what my project next weekend will be? Heh.

Anyway, things are sweetness again for putzing around town. I'm cool with
that.

I'm off for my Father's Day lunch. Happy Fathers Day all you dad-types!!!
