	Based on having brought a relatively obscure (in USA) Triumph Herald
back into working condition, I've got to say that VW Bus fans have NO
IDEA HOW LUCKY WE ARE!!!! For most 1968-1979 era cars, there is NO
aftermarket beyond starters and alternators. VW made MILLIONS of busses.
Here in Northern California I see more than one splittie/bubble/vangon/eurovan
on my way to work every day. I can go buy oil filters, brake shoes,
brake cylinders (master and slave), window seals (choice of multiple
vendors!) blah blah blah for our '70 single cab.
	Compare to a '63 Triumph Herald, where a valve job required finding
four exhaust valves from three different sources in three different states,
where finding a car in a junk yard (yes, I found one) meant deciding what 
to strip from a car that was arguably in better shape than mine, and
a convertable too. I had to give my word of honor (which I kept) to
return the six old brake shoes for resurfacing, since they are
sold on a STRICT echange basis. Not to mention what you'll pay
for the various latex novelties that go into a modern car and suffer
from age. Next time you're shopping for repair sheetmetal, ask them
for Triumph Herald parts :) Oh, and the used master cylinders I found
were worse than mine, so I rebuilt my own, probably not as well as I
could have.
	And this was 10 years ago. Any FOOL can restore a '63 Bus, 
much less a '73, the same age today as that Triumph was then. 
	PARTS SHORTAGE? I don't think so.
	It IS becoming less cheap. Some parts are not available as new from VW 
or VW's sources. (single and dual vaccuum distributors, for example). Some
parts are junk-yard only items, but gee whiz, there are PLENTY of 'em
in junk yards. 
	No, some day the old VW bus will not be an inexpensive transportation
option. In fact I suspect an original series Chryco minivan is already
cheaper to own (if not as nice). And yes I've seen early series
Voyagers covered with G$_at_#%$_at_( D!)( stickers. :)

	Sure, NOS this and that is gone when its gone. Buy 'em if you need one.
Sic tranist gloria mundi.

	Happy motoring!
	Bill
