Subject: under coating on cargo floor

Ok
I had a thought and I would like to get some opinions on it.
I am thinking of putting some of the rubberized undercoating
stuff on my cargo floor (after dealing with any rust)
I am then going to put down a layer of heat resistant
padding and then carpet. Since 99% of my busses rust is
on the cargo floor, I thought this might be a good way
to help prevent further rusting. Whatcha think?????

Thanks to all the responses to my Cv questions and such!! :)
