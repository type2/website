Okay I'm stumped so I thought I would ask all of you good folks.

I have a 5.5&quot; wide 14&quot; dia. wheel with a 25mm offset.

I want a 6&quot; wide 15&quot; dia. wheel --- with ??? offset.

I want to keep the inside offset more or less the same so I don't rub the 
suspension parts - like the shocks, etc. I'm staying away from adaptors and 
spacer plates so for me those are not options.

I know a big offset stresses the suspension in the wrong ways and that's 
why I am trying to figure out what the new 15&quot; wheel offset would have to be.

Two wheels - with the different widths listed up above would return 
different offsets right? How would a fellow figure what the new unknown 
offset needs to be? It's really simple I'm sure but I don't see it.

If one wheel is marked ET=25, and the other is marked ET=35, and both were 
the same dia., does this tell you the wheel will stick further out of the 
fender well or further in the fender well.

My local tire stores were equipped with sales folks that neither had cross 
reference sheets and sales people that didn't even have anything more than 
a vague understanding of what I'm asking.

Trying my best to get my facts straight before I go junkyard hunting.

Oh, and since most of you are thinking  -- those wheels don't fit our cars 
-- these are for another one of my other projects -- not list related.

Thanks very much everyone!!!
