Hello ;-)

I'm having a problem with my gas gauge also. Before installing a new engine in
the bus the gauge worked fine, but now the gauge reads fine until the half way
mark then drops off to
empty within 1or 2 gallons more of use. This is freaking me out...I'm starting
to fill up at the
half way mark just to avoid the stress of the unknown...It now seems that I
see my local gas station attendant more than my wife. I need help...any glues
would be appreciated.

Thanks and happy motoring
