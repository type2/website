Subject: continually tight valves

Hello all.
Recent discussions about torqueing head bolts makes me wonder. Nearly
evertime I adjust my valves, usually 2,000-2,500 miles, they are tight. Like 
I can't even get the .006 in there tight. Not always all of them, but maybe 
6 out of the 8. Any reason why this would be? The SIR ruibld has about 
12,0000 miles on it now, but the same was true of my old engine. I was told 
they would be tight as it breaks in. This still the case?
I also had loose head bolts, some very loose (12-14ft lb), and I tightened 
bottom 4 only. I still get conflicting info on this, whether thats ok or the 
need to tighten all 8. I think I'll hedge my bets from now on and only 
tighten all 8.
Could this be related to the tightened valves? (It has been suggested that 
the head bolts are coming out of the thread. If I drop the engine, take the 
heads off, what is the procedure for setting things right?)
I think Jake Raby suggested that if the engine gets too hot, it will tighten 
the valves. (I may have misinterpreted him.)I have a sump VDO temp sender, 
and it rarely gets above 230degF, usually around town hovers 180-220. road 
trip 220-230, unless going uphill on mountains, or in Texas desert.
Background info: 1971 westy, 1600dp, I'm sure the valve adjustment procedure 
is correct (TDC for each valve)
Thanks, wink
