By the way, if I am doing something wrong in posting, I am still new and =
getting the hang of it. Jan B
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I would be interested to know where on the engine you took readings, =
and
&gt; what the readings were relative to ambient temps.
&gt; Thanks,

In hindsight, I wish I had written the temperatures down. The only time =
that
I was really concerned was when we hit the area of S.W. Utah, near Zion
Nat'l Park. That was some intense heat. I recall that the engines felt =
very
hot.. everything was hot!, so we stopped and took readings. I never =
thought
to check the temperature of anything else, and with a remote IR sensor =
you
can only measure the temperature of object surfaces, not air.. the =
surfaces
can be much hotter or cooler (depending on many variables) than air
temperatures, which are the only thing really relevant to the engines =
(air
was the only external thing that the VW engines were in contact with, =
and
thus the only external factor that could influence their temperature).
Without any reference to go by, I could only guess that the two engines =
being so
close together as they were in temperature was a relatively good thing.. =
But I still knew that we were
pushing the limits, because I seem to recall that their temperature in =
&quot;the
hot place&quot; was about 225* F..maybe a little closer to 230* or so. I
remembered years ago talking to a guy about an after-market sending unit
that he was selling that sent a ground to an under-dash buzzer when the
engine reached 250*.. that meant you were headed for trouble, pronto. =
(STOP
THE BUS NOW!) These units attached to the heads, as I recall. I never =
got
any, but I remembered that number...250* F, and I decided it was safe to =
go
on. We did.. no problem!
I measured several areas in the engine compartment and I felt that the =
most
accurate reading (representing temperatures internal to the crankcase) =
was
on the end of the block, near the ends of the cam and crank.
Let me say that these engines were either new (Mexican) or newly rebuilt
dual port engines with stock carbs, etc. and (this is important) =
doghouse
coolers with heat vent, correctly installed.. AND, all shrouding and =
engine seals
were in place. I don't think that anything else would do so well in that
kind of heat. It must have been over 100*, and we heard on the news that =
Las
Vegas, fairly close by, had been getting temperatures in the mid-100's. =
It
was late afternoon, and there was nothing in the way of foliage, breeze,
water or shade in that environment. It was pretty.. Too pretty to be =
Hell,
but sure hot enough. It must have been around 104* or so. So, you've got =
to
figure that for an air-cooled engine to be running only about 125* above
ambient temperature is not bad.. I think that we had made previous =
readings
of about 185* - 195* in the cooler climates (est 65-75* F). What this =
tells
me is that an aircooled is going to be able to handle most ambient
temperatures, IF IT IS CORRECTLY INSTALLED AND MAINTAINED, but the =
margin
for error is very close, and it needs close watching if you are driving =
in
extremely hot conditions..=20
According to the measurements I took, it seems that a correctly =
installed, maintained=20
and performing dual port with doghouse and stock tower oil cooler is =
going to be running about=20
120* above ambient temperature.=20
We did not have any kind of external scoops installed, and we used only =
the
stock &quot;tower&quot; oil cooler for the doghouse type setup. Our mechanic =
explained
to us that if all the engine seals were installed properly, that the fan
would create a vacuum and draw air in through the stock air intakes on =
the
upper rear quarter panels.. not the superheated air from the vicinity of =
the
exhaust system. There is NO need for external scoops or oil coolers if =
the
seals are installed all around the engine and on the engine lid. He was
right!
And it goes without saying that then the most important element in your =
engine compartment is=20
going to be the fan belt.=20
We're just now getting back into VWs after a long period when we didn't =
do
much with them. I had only one running, and that was an old '69 Sundial
conversion that I was fighting to keep alive.. not a good experience
overall, and it eventually got it's death wish granted with the help of =
an
errant motorist. We stripped it and had it hauled away. Those Sundial =
conversions were a lousy use of a panel van anyway.=20
We get more and more interested and excited about these older VW =
aircooled
vehicles every day. They really are a wonder. Jan B
