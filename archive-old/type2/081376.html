Subject: Fw: [T2] Piezo ignition

Thanks Steve,

I've had a look and it does not &quot;click&quot; so I think there may be a piece
missing from way back.

I'll probably take your advise and get a replacement.

Cheers,

Dave

&gt; &gt; The piezo igniter on my west fridge doesn't seem to be working.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Does it work by hammering on the crystal? ie No voltage applied
anywhere.
&gt;
&gt; Yup! you have hit the quartz crystal on the head!  When you hammer on
&gt; quartz, it reacts by generating a fairly hefty electrical charge.  If the
&gt; charge is lead along a wire, it can spark to a nearby ground.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I've taken it apart and there doesn't seem much to it!
&gt;
&gt; Nope there sure isn't, is there? Hammer, crystal, wire, electrodes and
&gt; out.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Can I get a replacement?
&gt;
&gt; At any place that sells propane barbeques or any  RV store, yes.  In the
&gt; US, almost every outdoor gas appliance with a built-in igniter has a piezo
&gt; ignitor.  Any can be adapted to work for you (with modification, of course
&gt; :-)
&gt;
&gt; Before you get a replacement, tho...  the reasons that they stop working
&gt; are that the wire has separated from the crystal (1% of the time) or the
&gt; electrodes have gotten out of alignment/too far apart (99% of the time).
&gt; if you hold a grounded (with a jumper wire) screwdriver about 1-2mm from
&gt; the point of the contact and press the button, do you get a spark to the
&gt; screwdriver?  (do't do this to your finger, it *can* burn you!) If you get
&gt; a spark to the screwdriver, then the attachment is good, so look at the
&gt; spark gap end of things.  The piezo spark will jump about the same gap as
&gt; a spark plug, 1-2 mm.  It really helps if the tips of the electrodes are
&gt; (a) clean and shiny, nor carbon covered and (b) over the gas orifice.
&gt; Try cleaning and realigning the electrodes before popping for the new
&gt; igniter.
