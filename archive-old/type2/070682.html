&gt;Hi Chris
&gt;You can see the m-code plate,, it has the 5 there for 1975
&gt;the serial number is 2352134159
&gt;which is a 75
&gt;and the door B pillar says 05/75
&gt;hows that

Jamie,

You got me? My best guess is the kombi was made in 5/75 at VW. The 
bus was eventually shipped to Westfalia but was not converted until 
the 76(starts Aug or late July) model year. I believe the buses were 
shipped in primer. The color of the bus interior and exterior is sage 
green and the interior is that of a 76 to 79 westy. The only real 
body difference (stuff done at the VW plant) I can think of at the 
moment between 75 and 76 campers is that the passenger seat bulkhead 
has been removed and a swivel seat installed. Perhaps the rear 
latches were changed from chrome to black plastic.

Chris
