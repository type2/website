Subject: Re: [T2] Hi Listers I'm Back!!! need engine info...

Ahhh, Andy,

Just one of those things...I was just talking to a guy last night
at the local VW club meeting that was talking about having one of 
those on his 71 bus...*now* a 71 bus with a bad engine as it &quot;loosened&quot;
up the oil pump and dumped all the oil on the ground before he could get 
it shut off....he now has a nice lump of metal instead of an engine.

As Karl says...probably *not* a good idea...but useable nonetheless, 
until the oil gets dumped..

As always YMMV!

Cheers, dave

&gt; &gt; If it is an original bug case, then you will not have the 3 holes in the case below the crank pully for the
&gt; &gt; rear support bar.  There was a mickey mouse bar on the market that allowed you to use a bug engine in a bus,
&gt; &gt; but the bar used the tiny oil pump studs. NOT a good idea. I would never use one.
&gt; 
&gt; I have to disagree a little here Karl.
&gt; It does mount to the oil pump studs but also bolts through a lower case
&gt; bolt.
&gt; Given a choice of using a good bug motor with the bracket or spending over
&gt; 1K for a new motor I would use the bracket.
&gt; Yes a bus motor is better. But the brackets work. Ive seen them in action
&gt; and have not actually seen one fail.
