Subject: [T2] Oh, so that's what flooded means

The 1776 with Kadrons was running a bit rough for a week and then wouldn't
go at all. I pulled the engine,  placed it on my assembly stand,  and began
to disassemble it. I'm about a third of the way through but what I found
was a shock.  Here's the story.

First, when I removed the muffler, about a cup of gas spilled out of the
flanges where the heat exchangers connect.

Then another cup of gas spilled out of the heat exchangers when I removed them.

I removed the Kadrons to find that the intake ports in the heads were full
of gas. The level was all the way up to the gasket between the Kadron
intake manifold and the head. Float bowls seemed at a normal level and the
needle valves moved easily.

I then removed a valve cover and promptly felt gas running down onto my
shoes.  Same with the other side.  Both rocker arm cavities were completely
full of gas.  This situation must have been so for a while, because  the
rockers are brand-new-clean looking and the bead of silicone sealant which
I ran around the head stud nuts is all crinkley as though it had been
submerged in gas for a while.

I bet I've dumped several quarts of gas from various cavities so far.

Tomorrow, I'll begin pulling tin and remove the heads.

Can anyone suggest what might have happened?

Jack
