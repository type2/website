Subject: Re: VW 3 : Locksmith 1

So, you must've called El Vavoso* (Baboso?) Locksmith Service.   I was 
once a locksmith in Austin.  When I got a call to unlock a car with 
vent wing windows, I smiled inside, but sympathized outwardly with the 
car's owner.  I knew that I would soon have $20-$40 in my pocket.  I 
never _once_ failed to open a vent wing window within a few minutes, 
max.  Occasionally, I would get the car's owner to help me by pushing 
in on the vent wing while I used my tools.

Trying to pick the lock is _the_ most difficult way to unlock a car.  
There're usually several ways to unlock a car (without resorting to 
using a brick).
