Subject: Re: [T2] Cabin Heat and 72-74 NOS

Someone -- I think it's Tom Wilson -- claims that bus exhaust parts 
were &quot;intended&quot; to be repaired by welding. At least, until they rust 
away completely. All of the u-tubes I've ever inspected (dozens?) have 
been welded, but usually ham-handedly.

I think this should go on the list for any major '75-'78 rebuild 
(unless you go with Bus Depot's cross-over crossover): find a welder 
you trust to make a stack-of-dimes weld with good penetration for these 
parts, then make sure the flanges are straight and true.

&gt;  These parts are stainless steel but the flanges are normal steel and 
&gt; are often quite warped from the heat. It makes sealing the exhaust 
&gt; system difficult unless you heat up and flatten the flanges and then 
&gt; grind them flat.
