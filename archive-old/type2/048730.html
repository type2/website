&gt;install a cigg outlet, and buy an inverter and a little floor heater?

christopher &amp; list:

would folks on the list speak to the practicality of an installed accessory
outlet (cigarette or westy silver socket) and an electric blanket hookup?
has anyone had success with that set-up? and how about the potential to run
an electric blanket on a long line to the sleeping areas.
