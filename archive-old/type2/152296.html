&gt; ok volks heres the deal.... i got the bus fixed thanks to lots of  advice and help from many list members.... and mark for sending me the parts to make it possible....

&gt;   the sway bar bushing i could not fix right now so i wrapped it in a
&gt; wire clamp for now till i can get another clip for the bracket....
