Subject: FW: 2.0L Engine Noise

Hi Folks,

I moved from flat Orlando to hilly San Diego, and my 77 Bus now tends to
make a very rapid rattling noise from the engine area when decelerating,
especially at slower speeds going down the steep hills in San Diego. It
often occurs momentarily as the engine slows to idle when taken out of gear.
I think the noise may have occured occasionally in Orlando, but the hills
here seem to make it much more frequent. It kind of sounds like a big diesel
truck using its engine brake. It doesn't seem tmperature dependent.  Is this
normal on hills, or possibly a bad thing? I don't know the miles on the
engine, but it runs fine, gets frequent tune-ups, and had compression about
130 all around less than a year ago.

Thanks,
RickG
