Subject: An all weather Everybus!

Takes a licking and keeps on ticking. That's the VW spirit! And it was
exhibited well at Everybus. One attendee (who's really spectacular Irish
Vanagon broke down on the way) said that he was tickled to see that everyone
got out and mingled in the rain. (Yes we are no whimps or whiners or we'd
not own our busses very long!)

Everyone had a great time splishing and splashing in the puddles and then
hanging around the fire in the pavilion. (You should have seen the socking
hanging from the damper handle! Someone said it looked like Christmas.
Another person said that they thought they wouldn't want to eat any candy
that came out of those socks. My sentiment exactly.)

 I stole a march and came up Thursday (Gus and I like to go slow and poke
around so we stayed in Archdale on Thursday night). We went into Highpoint
and saw the place where General Joe Johnston's men were mustered out of the
Confederate Army after the terrible battles fought after the fall of Atlanta
and on the way over to the campground we saw the little church founded by
the Quakers who were for freeing the slaves and who founded their
manumission society there. The area is rich with history and is very
beautiful with placid rivers and creeks running throughout. The azaleas and
dogwoods were in full bloom and the overcast gave the light a greenish cast
which made the colors even more intense.

Nikki Elko and H. Steve were there and it was such fun to finally meet them
both! The Full Moon Bus Club was well represented although we really missed
Joy. I caught a glimpse of Dave Easterwood every now and then and met lots
of folks who are great fun to be with. There were a few RV'ers who joined
right in and had a wonderful time too. (I met a really nice couple from
Virginia who spend all their time traveling. The guy looked suspiciously
like William Least Heat Moon...oh well, I'm just finishing up his book &quot;Blue
Highways&quot; where he travels the back roads of the U.S. in his Ch*vy van and
that might have something to do with it...that along with the fact that
traveling and hanging around people with such good karma present an
atmosphere ripe for visions etc.).

There were people selling a few things (Of course Richard Palmer was there
with his extra neato t-shirts of which I bought a bundle in advance which
leads me to the admonition/advertisement that you really ought to order at
least one of these from Richard for yourself. Everyone who didn't order
wound up really wanting one and Richard didn't have enough to sell everybody
so a lesson learned...). There was a therapeutic masseuse (where the devil
was she *Thursday* night after my white knuckle stroll up I-85 in the wind
and rain and semi storm!) One person, now a friend, thought I was selling
tent poles and yard tools (I do bring alot of stuff) so I wound up giving
him a tent pole and he gave me this really cool indestructible camping cup
which is US army issue. I will treasure it always and will inscribe Gus's
name on it.

Kudos and many, many thanks to the Roanoke Valley Bus Club for their killer
good cookout Saturday night! It was a lot of work and trouble but I know
everyone enjoyed themselves and appreciated the effort. Kudos go to Chris
too, for arranging this event and pulling it off with such success! As the
small town newspaper reporters are fond of saying, &quot;A good time was had by
all&quot;. That sums it up.

Chris and Gus the &quot;Oh boy when do we do it again?!!&quot; Bus
