I'm wrecking out an 82 Vanagon.
The complete engine is gone but it has everything else.
The vehicle was stolen and recovered without the engine.
It has an automatic that was working good but now the transmission is
buyer beware because... You know how fast wrecker drivers go and it was
recovered 35 miles from where it sits now.
If somewone in the Dallas area would like to have it for just body parts,
after I have this parts sale you can have the complete body (it has only
two little rust spots) I'll almost give it away.
