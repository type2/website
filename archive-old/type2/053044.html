Subject: luggage spacers

Hello,

We're getting to go camping at the beach this week and I came up with a 
simple and inexpensive if not original idea for the elusive luggage rack 
spacers.  Home depot, plumbing dept., 1.5&quot; qwik-cap use for plastic pipes.  
It spaces just right and has a little flex.

Hope this helps,
