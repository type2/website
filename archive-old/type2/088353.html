Subject: Re: [T2] window mechanizm fix


Just spend the money for a new Window regulator, the most expensive ones are
$30 and they are a breeze to put in.

&gt; My driver's side window winder is stripped (not the
&gt; handcrank, but the internal mechanism.
&gt; The boneyard stuff I've found is highly questionable.
&gt; Can one overhaul the winding gizmo one'sself? Parts?
&gt;
&gt; If not, Any ideas on modifications? I would love to
&gt; put something like the old splittie sliding window in.
&gt;
&gt; (For the time being I have a three-position notched
&gt; stick inside the door. Full up, half up, and down.
&gt; Fred Flintstone would be impressed.)
