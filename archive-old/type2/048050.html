RICHARDSON BRIAN sends:

&gt; I am on Chirco's waiting list for the 1175$ zero mile 1600dp.  I plan on
&gt; changing from reg oil to synthetic(Any thoughts?) and I think i read
&gt; somewhere that my doghouse oil cooler (1971 westy) must be replaced.  Is
&gt; this so? I guess it makes sense.  Also do you guys have any opinions on
&gt; full flow oil kits(filter, cooler, thermostat,maxi pump etc).  I wanted
&gt; to run a full flow kit to get the extra cooling and filtering but the
&gt; muir book says they are not worth it. Does anyone out there have a oil
&gt; cooling kit they seem to enjoy and have few problems with?  any response
&gt; will be greatly appreciated.

Here's what I'd do. First, click on the link in my sig and print that out.
It contains a parts list for a Type 1 engine. Then start hitting
aircooled_dot_net (John, how is my master cylinder order coming?) and Bus Depot.

Order a case first, and before you do anything else send it to Rimco or
Painter's Grinding to be drilled and tapped for full-flow oiling. Once
that's done you can use a spin-on oil filter on your Bus.

Can you do this with a $1175 Chirco zero-mile engine? Yeah, but you need to
tear it down, which kinda defeats the purpose of motor-freighting an engine
in.

On a Bug, I wouldn't/didn't use the external oil cooler, but if you can find
a good place to mount it, it might not be a bad idea in a Bus.
