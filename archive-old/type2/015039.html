&gt;Hi all,
&gt;
&gt;     I realize that this is the Type 2 list but I think it's applicaple.  I
&gt;just test drove a 82 Westy.  The first time I have ever driven a Vanagon.  I
&gt;have always had bays.  It seemed to be in very good shape.  Is there
&gt;anything different to look out for?  
I have an 82, and Ive been happy with it.  Ther only thing to be aware of
is that it's the lowest power/weight ratio on the road, and is slow by any
standards.  Because of the lack of power, the engines tend to be flogged
more than most, and tend to be driven hot.  Make sure you get a compression
test, paying particular attention to (what else?) number three.  If there
are any problems, get a reduction in the price.  Parts are available, so a
rebuild isn't hard.  If you buy it, get a set of gauges.  Keep the revs up
on the hills.
