And again I say... contact Vintage Motorbooks in Beaverton, Oregon.  They
have Owner's manuals and Westfalia supplement manuals all the time and for
most any model year.  Also plastic covers/holders for the manuals, warranty
coupon books, all sorts of dealer literature, etc.

They are a good source for Bentley and other manuals, especially if you want
an early Bentley with color wiring diagrams.

&gt;&gt;  It is about the closest thing I can find to having an Westfalia owners
manual for my 1969 Westfalia, as original copies have seemed to disappear
off the face of the earth (I have been searching for an original for about a
year now with no luck).  &lt;&lt;
