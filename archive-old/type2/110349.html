Subject: Re: [T2] Bleeder Valve sheared off

&lt;&lt; You can try extracting it (the broken bleeder) by
various means, but I have found that it is less
frustrating and just as easy to install a new brake
wheel cylinder on that wheel, less tahn $10 at
BusDepot (sorry I couldn't help that shameless plug
;^) &gt;&gt;

Been a while since I was under a Beetle, but I seem to
remember that Beetle bleeder screws were 10 mm and
Bus bleeders were 8 mm. Am I remembering this correct-
ly? And if so why?
