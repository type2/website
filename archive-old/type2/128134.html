Subject: ADDITION to &quot;where does this wire go?&quot;

****There are actually 4 wires in this harness.  There is a Gray one also that goes to battery positive.  All these wires would be just for the test terminal and are not necessary to hook up to the battery.  Sure would like to know what that Yellow/red one is going to the &quot;middle&quot; of the battery though....never seen a battery with a terminal in the middle....
any ideas?

Chris sed:  3 Wires. Brown, brown/white, and yellow/red. All 3 wires end at the Test Network Plug. Grab your wiring diagram now and look. They are orange terminal spots #'s 7, 8, and 17. Brown goees directly to battery negative, Brown/white goes to where the battery ground strap connects to body, and the other shows it going to the &quot;middle&quot; of the battery. I have no idea what this &quot;middle&quot; of the battery is. Maybe Karl knows??
hope this helps guys...let me know..
-Chris
