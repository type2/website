&gt; And now to my squeak. This one is really puzzling me! It is a high pitched

&gt; car is moving, and it doesn't matter whether or not the engine is running. The

Ben,

We need more info on the sqeak.  What does it sound like (be 
descriptive).  Is it always present, or do you hear it just over bumps 
(how big?), around corners(how hard?), or when you back on the engine 
feathering the brakes pointing downhill around a left turn on gravel 
roads?  When you're stopped it is there?  What about when you turn the 
steering wheel?  Jump up and down on the front, then the back 
bumper--hear it?  Where does it appear to be coming from?  It it a 
shreik, a squeal, a grinding, a clunk, a whistling, or what?  Is there a 
rhythm to it?  You get the idea.

Tell us the whole story and maybe we can help you.

Tobin
