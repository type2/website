Gotten a good bit of info form you guys on what to check.  The general
concensus is the points.  Except it has a Pertronix in it..(which I failed
to mention..)

And then the O2 sensor...which it doesnt have, witht eh aftermarket header
system..It's not a blocked cat, either..

Mom went out and tried to start it again on her way to school this
morning, and it started. For a second.  then died right back, and did
nothing but whirwhir.

After she told me that, I relazied what the probelm probably is.  Fuel
pump/relay.  It's doing the exact same thing a rabbit truck I had did.
She also said its not the first time its done this, (I knew of one other
time, which I fiddled with it till it started..) she said it's been doing
it for a while now.  Would barely start, then die.  She could generally
come back later and it would start.

So, tomorrow morning I'm going to check the pump and relay, and see whats
what.  I was going to look at the Bentely, but of course it is IN the
bus...

letcha know..thanks...david
