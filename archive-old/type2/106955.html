Subject: Broken Valve spring?

My bus saga (latest chapter)

When I bought the bus, I had a great daily car (89 trooper) so the bus was
a project. I wasn't really concerned to heavily with the motor, as it
started and drove well, so I felt that I had a car to putter out to the
campground with and a good core for a rebuild (and the body is 95% and
beautiful). Well my daily driver hit a jacked up GMC on a logging road and
was totaled. No fault so I have a  bus, some $ (not enough for a new car)
and a good job. So the bus has got to be the daily driver while I save up
enough bread for another car.

The bus deal was 1600$ with a tune up and the carb gasket replaced (one was
leaking. The mechanic (PO) called yesterday and said that a valve spring
was broken and that he would replace it with no charge before he turned
over the bus. My question is What effect would a broken valve spring have
on the head? The car had full power at the time I test drove it, but I am
concerned that the head may be busted (ie burnt valve?) Should I offer to
buy a new/rebuilt head? I am going out to talk to the man today and see
whats up. But what does a broken valve spring mean as to the rest of the
valve train?

Thanks all

Duncan
