Subject: Re: [T2] How to undercoat a bus?

Hello William,
I worked in a paint and body shop for three years.
undercoating can be somewhat messy to work with so I
would definitely mask a curtain of news paper or
somthing around the inside edge of tje bottom of your
bus. when spraying it, it can splatter on your new
paint job or on primered areas. in either case you
have to remove it with somthing like lacquer thinner.
Paint won't stick to normal undercoating. To clean the
underside of your bus, a presure washer works well. As
far as preping goes, I would have the bus put on a
lift where you can easily get to the bottom of the
bus. Remove any loose undercoating with a puddy knife
or wire brush. This would be a good time to check for
rusted holes under your bus and check your front axle
rot as well. remove as much rust as you can from the
underside of the bus with a grinder, wire brush, and
navel jelly. work in smaller sections so you don't get
overwelhmed. clean those areas well with metal prep or
lacquer thinner until your rag is clean. Then prime
those areas with a good quality primer, paint those
areas with left over car paint if possible. now you
are ready for undercoating. The key is if you
undercoat over the old dirt, grime, and rust, you are
not doing much good. Most any undercoating will do.
Just be prepared to wait awhile for it to dry. It can
take up to a week to set up completely. 
I hope this helped.

&gt; My question is about the undercoating. I have never
&gt; done this before and
&gt; obviously the goal is to keep any part from rusting.
&gt; I would appreciate how
&gt; one might go by.
