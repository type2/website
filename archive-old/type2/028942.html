Wait you have a '77, my fault. Hey if any one is interested in putting a
padded late model wheel in there 68-74 let me know I am going to make sure
it works with the new column. We have tons of the padded wheels and tons of
cracked early unpadded wheels.

I have the parts to check it out, but I'm hoping that someone has BTDT
before me...

Will an '83 Vanagon steering wheel fit on a '77 steering column? The
'77s wheel is cracked and way too thin for my big hands.  The Vanagon's
wheel is big and cushy and just what I'd like to have.

TIA.

Jim
