Subject: FI and fuel pressure 

What i mean about fuel pressure is that when you step up the injector and 
richen the mixture with the potentiometer on the head temp sender, you need 
to keep the fuel pressure up to par (35psi) is all you need to keep a 
constant supply of fuel and atomize the fuel properly.
