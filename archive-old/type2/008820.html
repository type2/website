Subject: EGR filter innards examined
Message-Id: &lt;199904040213.VAA14200_at_mime3.prodigy_dot_com&gt;

Upon inspection of the 1975 bus I have,  (about 60K on it) I found that
one side of the still existing EGR filter was completely rusted thru so I
could pull it away- pulled out the innards, which is a pad  about 4.5 by 4
inches, an inch thick- made up of either copper or bronze fibers .004&quot;
thick and ribbon shaped under a microscope.  Looks like a &quot;Brillo pad&quot;
with the fibers horizontal to the vertical flow of gas.
The pad is thus about 15 cubic inches allowing for the tapering at the
sides- and had a lot of powdery black stuff embedded in the end proximal to
the muffler.  It is likly exhaust filtrate and explains why it probably was
given a 30K replacement requirement?   If one can find a source of bronze
wool that won't migrate as fibers, then a functional filter for exhaust
recirculation should be fabricable?
