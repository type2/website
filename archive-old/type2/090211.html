Subject: Re: [T2] &quot;Fun&quot; sounds ;-P

&gt; (1) When accelerator is fully pressed to the floor or mostly there, a
&gt; rattling sound seems to be coming from the engine.  Closest I can compare
&gt; it to is a piece of plastic in a dryer. If I let off the gas pedal a bit,
&gt; it goes away (or at least it's low enough that I can't hear the rattling
&gt; any more).

This sounds like it could be pinging ie preignition. Very bad for a vw
engine if it is. Check the timing to make sure its not too advanced.
Good place to start anyway.

&gt;
&gt; (2)  Primarily when the vehicle has been driven around a bit (most likely
&gt; translates to --&gt; when engine gets hot), there is a definite clicking
&gt; sound.  I had a friend listen to it and he said it sounded like it was
&gt; coming from #1 or there was something up with my exhaust system.  Bah.  I'm
&gt; going to play with it a bit in my driveway once it cools down a bit so I
&gt; don't get too fried out there, but I have yet to get a definite answer on
&gt; what this might be -- except that a friend said he could take apart my
&gt; entire engine and *hopefully* figure it out.  Hehe.

Well I would check the valve adjustment first.

What engine? year?  solid or hydraulic lifters? carb/FI? distributor?
