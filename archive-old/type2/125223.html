Subject: RE: [T2] South African buses and double cabs

John,

Do you want a RHD double cab or just a bay window double cab? Shipping from
Germany to the East Coast is about $850 and there are plenty of good double
and single cabs in your price area available here. I am in Germany until
early June and can keep me eyes open for you. I have shipped my own bus to
Baltimore - so I know about all the shipping and importation details.

Marcus
