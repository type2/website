&lt;&lt;  My 
problem is that I cannot cut a good 45 degree angle in this hollow rubber 
material. I've tried using all sorts of cutting devices.  The results have 
been less than spectacular. I'm pretty much convinced at this juncture that 
I'm going to need some sort of very sharp power device to do a good job.  I 
think. &gt;&gt;

...Try filling the &quot;hollow rubber material&quot; with sand to stiffen it where the 
45
needs to be cut. A sharp serrated knife in a miter box should make the cut.
Do it in one smooth motion...Don't try to &quot;saw&quot; it.
