Chris Cybulski (vw69bus_at_mindspring_dot_com) was up here this weekend sans Michelle
and Stella. 

They are expecting another baby, send congratulations or condolences. :-)

Anyway, he brought the 72 hitch to see if it could be modified to fit the 71.
Looks like there is no hope, so am offering it for trade for a 68-71 model.
The design is wonderful. Uses the stock bumper mount holes and the main bar
lives behind (inside) the rear bumper. Can only see the ball which curves down
and around the bumper and NO holes in the bumper itself!

Chris has seen one on a 71, so I know they were available.

 Please help. If you do not need the trade, I will sell this one and buy
yours, so if anyone else needs the 72 and up model, contact me.

PLD,

RIc
