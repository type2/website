I believe that you'll find most of the information in books chronicling
the Boston, New York or Chicago transit systems.
Dallas made a slower transition with electric rubber tired busses running
on the same old electric grid after the steel wheel cars were sold off
and the tracks were pulled up.
As urban sprawl became suburban housing developments the independent
diesel busses replaced all others except in New Orleans, San Francisco
and a few other places that have them primarily as tourist attractions,
but as you know those have limited functions. Many electric systems
lasted for extended periods going to beaches and other high occupancy
locations.
I'd check out the library before I busted loose for paid research.
