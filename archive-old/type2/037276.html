Subject: compression

I want to thank all who responded to my thread about whether to pull the
heads when I do my clutch.  I did a compression check.  It was as follows.

1.  120
2.  135
3.  120
4.  120

     Pretty even &amp; well within the tolerances in Bentley.  Unless someone
tells me different, I am just going to retorque the heads &amp; change all my
fuel lines &amp; pushrod tube seals.
