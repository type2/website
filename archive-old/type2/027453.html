Light Truck simply refers to a industry standard &quot;generic&quot; name that 
everyone (all tire manufacturers use) to indicate this tire is good for pick 
up trucks and the like... NOT commercial trucks. Therefore any Van (loosely 
put) can use Light Truck tires... and MANY do! The Light Truck tire is 
usually a little beefier tire than a passenger car tire. Made for vehicles 
that are heavier and have a higher center of gravity. Although you should 
always check vehicle specifications 1st before you buy your tires. Load 
rating is very important.

Hope this info helps

&gt;  I don't believe that the Michelin is the only tyre with this
&gt;specification that's manufactured: Someone is spinning you a line.
&gt;
&gt;  What's this &quot;light truck&quot; thing anyway? You want a van tyre- that's
&gt;what you're driving... :-)
&gt;
&gt;Cheers,
&gt;	W.
