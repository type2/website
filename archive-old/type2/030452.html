Subject: Camping with the (movie) stars this weekend :-)

Volks,

Very peripherally to this group, a couple of the Washington bus owners
(including Paul Roberts and myself) are also involved in producing an
independent film.  This weekend, we are going up to shoot &quot;the lake scene&quot;
near Harpers Ferry and camp in the area.  The scene we are shooting
involves a &quot;crowd&quot;.  this is it!  Your chance at movie stardom!  OK,
well.. your chance to stand in a crowd and look interested  :-) 

I intend to camp in the area tomorrow night as well, if I can get a couple
of others to sit around and talk buses until the wee hours, but if it is
just a bus or two, I will be looking for a Walmart :-( OTOH, if we have
enough interest, there is a campsite up at the mouth of Antietam Creek in
the C&amp;O Canal park (~15 miles NW of Harpers Ferry) that looks like it
could be good!

If this interests you, call (202) 466 1641 for directions to the movie set
or e-mail me or Paul if you just want to camp!
