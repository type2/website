&gt; Dear Volks
&gt; 
&gt; I have a '68 crewcab.  Apparently in the normal '68 bus (and probably
other 
&gt; model year loafs) there is an air duct that goes across the front from the

&gt; center to the left and right sides at about a foot above the floor.  Part
of 
&gt; it on each side goes up to the vents in the dash.  Part apparently mates
to a 
&gt; vent duct going through each door to provide vent air to the rear of the
bus.
&gt; 
&gt; On the crewcab, the duct does not pass through the door.  Instead the duct
is 
&gt; blocked off on each end by a metal plate approximately 4 x 6 inches.  My 
&gt; crewcab is missing the left hand plate.  Can someone who has a parts book
or 


I believe, and this is purely from experience with campers, that the same
block off plate was used for campers. Any loaf westy has these and surely
they are what you are looking for.
