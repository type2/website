(generator wired to first battery; wire to secondary battery through a
switch).

Two problems, one major, one minor.  The minor one is that the switch
and wiring needs to be able to handle pretty hefty currents, because
of the major problem.

If you've managed to run the secondary battery down, when you turn
that switch on, it's going to look like a major drain/short to the
generator and primary battery.  I'd suggest some form of current
limiter between the switch and the secondary, that keeps the charging
current below something reasonable (10 amps?).
