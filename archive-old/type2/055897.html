Subject: question '72 rear axle hub . 

 Still deep in the under-workings of my van . . .

 The rear drums are the &quot;composite&quot; type . . studs are in a sub-plate
and the drum is held in place by 2 little screws . . 

 This &quot;sub-plate&quot; is listed as the &quot;axle hub&quot; . . .

 This &quot;hub . . is about six inch dia. . . wheel studs sticking out. .
big scallop in the circumfrence . .  

 That &quot;scallop&quot;, is probably a half pound &quot;out of balance&quot; from
where I stand . . 

 That's the question . . why the scallop imbalance and is there a 
position this should be in in relation to some other feature or 
each other on opposite ends of the drive train . .?

 thank you all . .  west  :-)
