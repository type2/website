Subject: oil coolers 

--part1_d0.2845cee7.2a301cbe_boundary

im replacing the motor in my 69-westy it went south alot of bottom end noise 
im worried about metal in the cooler ive used solvent and a compressor to 
blow it out and have not felt any metal come through flow is good should i 
worry about metal going through new engine. just want to be carefull should i 
start looking for a junkyard cooler (unkown condition) or will it be ok new 
coolers are hard to find 

thanks
