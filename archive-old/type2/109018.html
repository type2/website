Subject: 1978 FI

Hello all,
2 questions.  I am getting terrible gas mileage on a 78 FI with automatic
transmission.  I am getting 14-17 mpg.  I have checked and adjusted the timing
and dwell, install new distributor cap and points.  What else could be a
culprit?  Usually travel 65 mph or less.

Second question, the check oil light has been on quite a bit.  I have just
changed oil and filter and strainer.  This am, it was blazing red for quite a
while, and then fluttered the remainder of the 100 mile trip.  Seems to me to
be an electrical gremlin but thought I would ask.

Kind Regards,

Frank E Biffath III
