Subject: type2 traffic

Hi all,

It's Friday. I love the type2 list. Good knowledge and wisdom and great people. 

In the beginning I was flooding my work email account with all the
type2 list traffic, sometimes upwards of 40-50 emails a day. Then I
got gmail, which adds the power of google searching to your email.
It's great, like having your own mini type 2 archive at your disposal.

I currently have 50 gmail invites that I'll gladly give to anyone who pmails me.

bus content: the snow is melting! Forecasted 40 degree (F) days this
weekend. Looks like it's going to be a great weekend to get out and
work on the bus. Now, if I could just get this carb adjusted maybe I
could even go for a ride.


peace
jules
