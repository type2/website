Message-Id: &lt;199906301708.KAA24784_at_helix.ucsd_dot_edu&gt;

&gt;Question: is it by any means possible to replace this spring without 
&gt;pulling the engine ?? 

Yes, but it requires iron patience and nerves of steel.

&gt;Question 2: is it possible to tighten the upper row of head nuts without 
&gt;pulling the engine ?

Again, yes, but if you need to replace a valve spring and torque your 
heads, you'd be much better off dropping the engine. It would be faster, 
much easier, and give you a better result.
