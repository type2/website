&gt;&gt;   Where have you compiled your info from--that a properly  rebuilt engine
&gt;&gt;   will not last as long as the original ?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;   Not by you perhaps--but any compitant machine shop should be a be to
&gt;&gt;   duplicate as well surpass the original units longevity with no
&gt;&gt;   problems--
&gt;&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Cheap shot and uncalled-for by someone who does know or has not seen my
&gt; work.

Yeah, well, what do expect, considering the source. Sometimes I really
wonder why someone would bother putting words down if they have nothing
helpful to say, or worse, use it as an opportunity to belittle another
member of our group. It pisses me off.


&gt; Yes, the builder is at least 50% of the equation with regard to engine
&gt; life. The rest is quality of parts and workmanship done by the machinist on
&gt; those parts. If I was willing to accept poor quality it would not have taken
&gt; me at least 6 months just to gather most of the parts together. How many
&gt; standard cases have you found that meet factory specifications? If you have
&gt; one I will certainly buy it!


Jeff, you have every right to to be concerned about availability of quality
crankcases. I have seen, in three years of looking, exactly two NEW type IV
crankcases. Someone in my area had a bunch from when VW of Canada closed
their remanufacturing plant here, but those are all gone I think.

There are very few shops in the country who can line bore a type IV case
properly. The primitive boring bars used by most type I shops will not work
even though some shops will try! (as you found out the hard way)

Secondly, main bearings which are oversize on the case are nearly impossible
to source. I would expect the bearing manufacturers to address this in the
near future, as it is surely a world-wide scenario.

The notion that type IV cases don't distort because they are aluminum is a
myth. Or ancient history, at least. The aluminum material IS stronger than
mag, and resists main bearing saddle distortion better than a type I case,
but as you say, these crankcases are getting long in the tooth and most are
now in need of line boring.

&gt; 
&gt; I have returned three sets of Kolbenschmidt  main bearings because they were
&gt; packed wrong and damaged in shipping. I have received a poor quality
&gt; camshaft from a major VW supplier and returned that. A reputable engine
&gt; builder has ruined one of my best cases with a sloppy line bore (0.002
&gt; oversized main bores). Very little quality control in this business.

It can be frustrating to find people who make their living with this stuff
and don't seem to care. You may need some new suppliers. Aircooled_dot_net is an
awesome source for anything to do with your engine, they sell only the best
quality parts and have fabulous customer service. The principal of that
company is an enthusiast who cares about what he sells.
  
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; IF the person who contracts the work to be done has the machine shop use
&gt;&gt; top shelf parts as well as spends the money to have the parts installed
&gt;&gt; right.--
&gt;&gt; No jippo parts or labor.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; No skipping anything--
&gt;&gt; No savig a buck--
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; The problem here is not the engine case--it's a case of cheapness--which
&gt;&gt; causes the problems in the engine's longevity.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; And this isn't the cases fault--
&gt; 
&gt; Know of any builder who will offer a decent warranty on their work? That is
&gt; why I do all my own work. I am better than any builder as I will use what I
&gt; am building and hence will be super anal about the quality and workmanship
&gt; going into it.

Good shops are out there, but their prices are out of reach for many people
for a complete engine. There are very few excellent machine shops. RIMCO for
general machine work and headflow masters for cylinder heads. Others have
used NW connecting rod, but I have experience with them.

&gt; 
&gt; And what do we do when they degrade past economical
&gt; refurbishment?
