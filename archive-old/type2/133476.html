&gt; Dave Ireland has had a problem with his bus this past weekend and is
&gt; looking for a 73 auto tranny... His TC and flex plate are fine, he
&gt; needs a new/used final drive section. If anyone has any leads, please
&gt; email  daveireland_at_sympatico_dot_ca.

with very little extra work you can put the newer 75-79 auto tranny in the
older bus...
