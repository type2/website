Subject: 68 westy update(free bus)

hey volks,
now that my excitement is containable, i can post
without babbling....maybe.   anyways, i got the bus
home yesterday and &quot;unpacked it&quot;.   man the guy was
right when he said he was going to rebuild the engine
and had everything to do it with.   it was sorta like
a dream, more parts than ive ever seen.   he has the
case, looking clean and ready to go, redone crank, box
of pistons/sleeves never opened, unopened bags of
seals, bearings, all kinds of stuff, actually more
than i can comprehend.   interior looks to be all
there, albeit in somewhat poor condition.   biggest
downfall is someone took apart the ignition, steering
wheel area?   steering whell hangs free and all wires
cut, that should be fun to figure out.   i think after
i get lizzy going im going to attempt to rebuild the
engine, its just i feel like im looking at a puzzle
with parts everywhere.   does have the original radio
in it however.   body is fair, someone did a
half-assed panel replacement job on, but it actually
came out looking pretty good for a cob-job.    ill get
some pics posted soon and will let everyone know of
its progress.   i can tell im gonna wear out my
manuals on this rebuild.
