Basically, what I've found is that I should rebuild the motor at some point
and, at that time replace the 1700 slugs with the larger 1800 slugs and
convert to hyd lifters.

Does this require a head change as well?

FI seems to be the consensus as well.

Seem consistent?

&gt;You can convert the stock 2.0-liter '77 Type IV engine to hydraulic
&gt;lifters (no more valve adjustments) fairly easily. When rebuilding the
&gt;stock '77 engine, replace the cam, lifters and pushrods with the '78-'83
&gt;hydraulic versions of these. Voila! Instant hydraulic-liftered Type IV
&gt;2.0-liter engine.

&gt;Can this be done to my 1700 motor?

Absolutely.  There is also a small difference in the rocker arm assemblies
- I can't remember exactly but I believe there is a difference in the
spacers on the rocker shaft.  If you have a 78-up parts motor, use the
assemblies from it just to be safe.
