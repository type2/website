&gt;&gt; hey listees,
&gt;&gt; I need some VDO guages and am on a budget, so if anyone either has the
&gt;&gt; actual guages or possibly a lead on good used ones, let me know.  I am
&gt;&gt; looking for oil temp, oil press, possibly cylinder head temp, and
&gt;&gt; possibly a tach. Thanks

&gt;Go to a junkyard and scrounge around in the 80's rabbits, jettas, audi's
&gt;etc.
&gt;
&gt;a lot of those cars came with VDO gagues (many calibrated for metric
&gt;though, degrees celsius, bar, etc VS psi degrees fareheit..)
&gt;
&gt;Never seen a tach like that though... but i guess if you found an
&gt;instrument cluster from a 4 cyl VW you could cut the tach out and make it
&gt;fit in a bay cluster...

My oil temp gauge came from an old 70s Sirocco I used to own, very nice VDO
but in Cel like Steve says. Oil press may be out there, but you won't find
CHT in a junkyard or a small round VDO tach either. A lot of older early
70s foreign cars had groups of round gauges and you may find a round tach
small enough to fit in the clock hole on your dash. Any 4 cylinder tach
should work. I had the square shaped tach from the Sirocco sitting on top
of my dash for a little while, but it really wasn't relevant to my driving
style.

Some of the 911s and 914-6s had a really nice combo oil temp/oil
pressure/fuel gauge I would love to get to replace my fuel gauge, but even
the kit to make your own is hard to find besides all the gauge modules and
senders. Big bucks too.
