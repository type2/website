I'm going to clarify a few points.

&gt;there are two basic models, the early ones 73-75 were vacuum shift models
&gt;the later ones 76-79 were govenor shift models. the final drive was the
&gt;same on both.

Final housing casting is not the same, the governor is in the final.

&gt;the early ones are much harder to find parts for and adjust. the later
&gt;ones were internally almost identical to the Golf/Rabbit auto tranny so
&gt;the parts are still relatively avaliable 

Identical in fact to some Audi tranies, and identical in toto to Vanagon
automatics through '91 with a few exceptions.  Any golf/rabbit tranny only
swaps in by changing whatever looks like it needs it, the selector
shaft, mounting studs, those come to mind, the rabbit box has less
pressure plates than the Vanagon box, I'm not sure what is in the bus
version.  The buses use the early filter/pickup like rabbits of the same
era up to whenever it switched.  The Vanagon assemblies are bolt into
a bus up to when they have oil coolers on them for sure.  I think after
that the oil cooler could be a physical space issue (though you can leave
it disconected.)


&gt;be fantastic for city driving...there are other advantages to. it is next
&gt;to impossible to over rev or lug the engine, the tranny shifts for you.

Ahh but on the '82 I've noticed a really bad problem, because when
you get off the gas the torque converter permits the engine to fall back
nearly to idle, the auto is death on engine cooling.  Scenario is this, you
are flooring it up the hill (which you will) then you crest the top and let
off, engine speed, and thereby fan speed fall to nothing, engine gets even
hotter.  Monitoring oil and head temps in the '82 I find optimal engine
cooling actually takes place on a slight uphill grade, one that you have
no trouble climbing at say 1/2 throttle or so.  In a bus this won't be such
a problem, but on a 95F day, it will be a problem.

&gt;76 or later for sure.  BTW you can put an late tranny in an early auto
&gt;bus. vice versa is a little harder but doable

Or as I've mentioned about any tranny unit VW ever made from '78-'90
and any complete Vanagon unit tranny and final.

Which brings something up, there is an '87 (with oil cooler) sitting on
my front porch, 105k miles, ran well when removed, was reputably rebuilt
once (PO said so, oil pan painted blue, I'm not too sure.)

Will definitely fit any vanagon, as to going into the bus, depends on how
much space is in front of the nose of the tranny, I've not seen one recently.
Anyone interested?  I'd though BTW that you could plumb an air oil cooler
to the housing, or use the water one and a recirculating pump and a water
tank to make a nice shower heater (not potable cooler has run antifreeze.)
