Yeah, man
If that stuff is back there too close to the hot boxes, its gonna cook and you don't wann be around when it stinks...'course you know that now...

Most 'budget bus heat engineers' use that 3 or 4&quot; straight stove pipe stuff for the main channel. They say the 'flex line' or flexible exhaust pipe you can get causes flow/turbulence problems because of the currogated texture on the inside - slows the air down.

Once you get the whole system installed you can spray it with some insulation or wrap it or something to keep it warm.

Check out the g. matt bulley heat stuff on type2_dot_com. amazing.

I wouldn't have any plastic in the system at all if i could get away with it.

&gt; &gt; I &quot;creatively engineered&quot; a new main channel out of PVC pipes and connected
&gt; &gt; the heat exchangers to this pipe via flexible aluminum &gt;vent pipes.  the bad news is that I started smelling fumes, &gt;and my eyes got a
&gt; &gt; little watery and burning ...

&gt; Are you sure it's not essence of PVC pipe? Go get a hunk of &gt;triple-wall
&gt; chimney from a wood stove dealer and use that insteam.
