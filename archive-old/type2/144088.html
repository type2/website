Subject: Re: [BSKA] Fellow Bus WOman Needs help in Nebraska

Well after quite a few evenings it looks like we have
Renee up and running. Her bus seems to be running much
better than it did when she left on her trip.  She is
now firing on all four.  She shreded her clutch so we
put in a new disk and a club member had a set of carbs
we used one and tok parts off the other to make them
run. We set her valves all where tight and set her
timing this I think is where most of problem stemmed
from. She was running so badly she had to feather the
clutch to keep it running.  Well that lead to her
getting it so hot that the disk ended up looking like
a mouse nest of steel wool. We informed her that the
fixes we made where to get her home so that the way
she will be heading. Her plan is to go south on I29
thru MO to AK then accrost the Mississippi and thru
Tenn. I wish her luck.
