  Auto Town is a web site which allows users to post and search
for used cars and trucks for sale for free on the internet.

  There is no fee for including a picture/photograph with your ad.

http://www.autotown_dot_com/

  Choose your speed, then proceed to the &quot;Used Car Cinema&quot; and
select Post Your Used Car.

  Enter the information about your vehicle; when completed you
will receive an ID number for your car posting.

  If you have a picture of your car (in JPG or GIF format)
email it to editor_at_autotown_dot_com with your car ID in the
Subject field and we will put it on our web site.

  Be sure to reference the id number of your vehicle in the email!

  When people in your locality search for cars or trucks they
initially get a summary listing including a thumbnail picture
of your vehicle.

  When they click on the thumbnail they will get the full size
picture with complete vehicle and contact information.

  We would also greatly appreciate any feedback (bugs?) about
our site that you may find.

  Please forward this to anyone you know who is selling their
used car or truck as well as anyone who might be interested in
buying a used or new car or truck.

  Thank you.
