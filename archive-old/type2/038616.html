Subject: WTB - 68-&gt; gas tank

I've decided that I'm going to install a loaf tank into my '60 panel - I'm
just not used to the limited range of the stock tank!  

Normally I'd just go out to the local PNP and grab one, but they've gotten
wise, and now pop hole in all the VW tank :(

I'm in the Sacramento area.  My plan is to replace the transmission in the
next week or so, so I'd wanna do the tank at the same time.

Thanks!
