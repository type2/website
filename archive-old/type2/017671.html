&gt; I just purchased a 1978 VW Automatic Transporter. The thing is in pretty
&gt; good shape with only 129,000 miles. I have a small tranny leak that I'll be
&gt; having repaired here later this week.
&gt; 
&gt; My question is regarding general maintainance. What the best type of oil to
&gt; us in the 2000cc engine? What other things should be looked at on a regular
&gt; basis? Any information would be helpful. Thanks!
&gt; 
&gt; Oh, btw, my sunroof is leaking as well. Where's the best place to get a seal
&gt; for that? And how tough is it to install?

Eric:
Get the owner's manual: it shows maintenance intervals for everything.
One item that it shows is to regularly put a few drops of oil on the
link that supports the rear of the sliding door; I've seen many of these
break or the nylon guides wear prematurely because of failure to oil
this. If it's already starting to not move smoothly, maybe it'll need to
be dissasembled to get the lube in. I don't think I've ever seen a bus
or Vanagon on a used car lot where this had been maintained by the DPO.
The owner's manual show this and many more important maintenance items.
I use 20w-50 oil in the summer and 10w-30 in the winter. Any mention of
brand or source is verboten on this list (or will be soon.)
Sunroof: My experience is that if a sunroof leaks it's because the drain
tubes are plugged. There are 4 drain tubes -one at each corner of the
opening- and they tend to fill up with mud and organic material and get
plugged. I've never unplugged the ones on my 82, but have on a beetle.
I'd use a piece of solid insulated #12 electrical wire 6 or 7 feet long
and just gently ream out the holes. I do worry about pushing off the
drain tubes from their attaching points in the body metal and the way to
avoid this would be to snake the cleaning tool up from the underside
thru the hoses. 
Does anyone on the list have more type 2 experience on this?
It helped on my 67 beetle which is similar.
