&gt;Like I mentioned in other posts, I just picked up &quot;Bess the Bus&quot; (78') about 3 weeks ago.  The owner said he had not driven her in about 8 months.  I came home and changed the oil right away and of course it was BLACK as midnight.  Should I now change the transmission fluid? 

You didn't say whether it was a manual or automatic tranny (I can hear Bob fuming from here!) but either way I would change the fluid on any new bus I bought.  You never know what the previous owner did or did not do!  Clean fluid never hurts.
