Subject: charcoal canister on a 71...

Greetings...

Quick question... Does anyone have any idea how the charcoal canister
(bolted to the roof of the engine compartment on the right side) that I
presume filters emissions might affect performance if full or clogged?
There is a good chance that mine hasn't been changed in many moons, and I
wonder if that might affect performance or the amount of air the carb
receives (tube runs to the air cleaner from the canister).....

Thanks,

Tom
