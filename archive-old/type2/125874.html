Subject: engine stands

Jack,
       I gave my engine stand away years ago, but I recall getting the best 
result beginning with a kind of near-semicircle to follow one side of the VW 
case.  A local weld shop was able to form this using something like 3/4&quot; square 
stock.  The middle section of this arc nicely supported the engine weight as I 
turned the case upwards to assemble...  Take a look at some of the engine stand 
figures in older VW shop publications and you will see what I mean.  Wish I had 
a scanner to send an image to you.  Possibly another List member can help in 
this regard.  BTW, how far are you from the Bonneville salt flats?

I have a Lufkin engine stand which appears nearly identical to the
current Harbor Freight engine stand. I can arrange the arms such that I
can bolt up three arms but not the fourth. I was considering using some
flat bar stock as an adapter when I noticed the stands illustrated at a
few of the vendors only appear to have two connecting arms. What do
y'all do to get your engines mounted on stands? Are three arms (one
high, two low) enough support?
