Subject: Empi 5 spoke adapters on 77 Westy

Well the search for Type2 Bay empi 5 spokes hasn't worked out, so the next step is to either buy the adapters to fit onto the stock 112mm bolt pattern (as sold on cip1_dot_com for 99 bucks a pair), or see if I can have the rotors redrilled out to the 205 bolt pattern of wide 5. I doubt I can, as it appears that the rotor diamter is too small to make it out to 205. So I have two questions:

1) Has anyone used the wide five adapters on the front of a Bay rotor?
2) Does anyone have a rotor handy to measure to see if it could be redrilled for the 5X205mm pattern?

Thanks,
Courtney
