Subject: BA6 heater install and ...

Hi All,
I have recently acquired a BA6 heater from a junker Vanagon.   I
pulled the entire setup from head to toe including the fan, furnace,
all wiring up to dash including dash switch, pump, coil, thermostat,
ducting including the  re-circulatory pieces under the bench seat.   

I was wondering if anyone had any insight into installing this into a
Vanagon without a previous heater. How complicated is it?  Also how
one might test the system out of the vehicle.  I'm sure I can test
the blower and all but would like to check the furnace operation.  

Also I will be selling this and was wondering what a fair price would
be?  Any help is gratefully appreciated.  Email me at
72114.723_at_compuserve_dot_com if you are interested in acquiring this
beast.  I would like to get rid of it soon and I am sure someone with
cold feet could put it to good use this winter.
