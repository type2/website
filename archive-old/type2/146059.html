&gt; Very good point.  You are much better off running
&gt; everything possible directly on 12v DC and using an
&gt; inverter only for things that can't be run off of
&gt; 12vDC and require 110v AC,and I can't think of
&gt; anything that I would need in a bus that falls in that
&gt; catagory, unless it is for the convenience of using a
&gt; small appliance from home.
