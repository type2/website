On 1/4 J.J. Blankenship inquired about the relative merits of the above 
referenced camper versions, and inquired about experiences with same.
When we bought our slightly used '75 Westy, in '77, we first looked over an 
Adventurewagon at an RV show and were most impressed with the quality of 
materials. However, the height of the vehicle and the additional weight of 
the fixed top ruled against it. The major factor was it was too high to fit 
into our garage. So our Westy has had the luxury of being protected from the 
California sun for 24 years and looks like it has a new paint job, whereas 
if we had the Adventurewagon, the sun and elements would have done 
considerable damage. I don't know how much heavier the Adventurewagon is or 
the extra wind resistance the height causes, but with the 1800 cc engine I'd 
also be concerned with the degradation of acceleration and mileage, compared 
to the Westy. The convenience of not having to pop a top is what makes the 
Adventurewagon attractive, but over the years I'm happy we bought the Westy.
