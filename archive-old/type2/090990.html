&gt;     says &quot;better fix that exhaust son, or you'll burn your heads up..&quot;

Mike,

As usual, the answer is yes and no :-)  A loud exhast *may* kill your
heads or it may just be annoying.  I depends on where the leak is.  The
important thing on exhaust from a head safety standpoint is that you
*must* have a solid exhaust from the valves out about 6-8&quot;.  The reason
for this is to keep room-temperature air from getting to the hot exhaust
valve stems immediately. If you run an engine with *no* exhaust, then
cold air can get to the hot valve stems and warp them, after which the
valve does not seal.  If you don't catch that right quick, the head is
toast.

The '76-78 exhaust fails in a couple ways.  First, as you have
experienced, the flanges warp.  This is noisy, but not dangerous.  Second,
the tubes rust out, usually at the flanges.  Again, noisy but not
dangerous.  Third, I have had the welds that hold the end castings onto
the headers break.  This is dangerous to your valves!  Take a look under
your bus, where the manifolds hit the heads.  If the leak is not there,
then fear only a policeman with a Db-meter (they do exist, even in
non-inspection states)
