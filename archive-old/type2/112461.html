&gt; That NASA stuff is the stuff you can buy through the JC Whitney

&gt; It's ok, but it's really just a carpet padding-like substance with a
&gt; aluminium skin on one side.

Does anyone have any experience with this stuff?

It's a 1/16'' thick asphalt sheet sound dampening material that seems  
like it might be able to take the place of the Q-Pads in the article  
(the JC Whitney ashphalt sheet seems like it's a lot less expensive).

&gt; As I've said before, when I get around to sound
&gt; proofing and heat proofing the bus next spring, I'm going to try out  
&gt; the
&gt; materials at www.coolandquiet_dot_com, which are more modern, fiberglass  
&gt; based
&gt; mats which are the same products being used in the new cars today.

Hm, interesting.  I guess the trade-off of this newer stuff is that  
it's thicker (~3/4'' vs ~3/8'' for the NASA insulation), and quite a  
bit more expensive ($79.20 [64x72] vs $26.95 [48x72] for the NASA  
insulation), though you do get a bit more material per roll with the  
LyTherm.

The thickness of the material is really the issue, for me.  I want a  
thermal and sound barrier for the floor of the Bus, but I also want to  
use my original Westy carpet (which is in *very* good shape - POs put  
plastic protective mats over it, which I got with the Bus), and there's  
probably not very much &quot;spare&quot; carpet at the edges.  Does the LyTherm  
compact well, and if so, does it maintain its functional properties?

&gt; I used to
&gt; do PR for Lydall, and comparing the two (NASA vs Lydall) there's no
&gt; comparison, in both quality and weight (the NASA stuff weighs like 5X  
&gt; as
&gt; much). Of course, the joke I always tell about &quot;NASA Technology&quot; is  
&gt; they
&gt; were still using 8088 IBM XT computers in the space shuttle up until  
&gt; about 4
&gt; years ago, when your home computer was able to do more processing than  
&gt; all
&gt; of the computers on the space shuttle combined! I sometimes wonder why
&gt; companies brag about using NASA technology, I'd be embarrased most of  
&gt; the
&gt; time!

Heh.  I worked at a NASA research center for 5 years.  We actually did  
develop some cool technology, honest!  But, yah, when it came to the  
space program (which, thankfully, I didn't work on ... pretty  
high-stakes/pressure job), stability and predictability was key.  Plus,  
by the time the technology transfer office gets around to licensing  
something, the patent is probably expired (and you thought your local  
building inspection department was slow... :-)
