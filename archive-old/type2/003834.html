Sorry, but someone has to respond to this - even if we are getting off
topic.

Needless to say, this is risky business. So I just want to make a few
points:

*Even a propane stove that is clean burning one minute, can be spewing out
CO the next - example: when the fuel gets low and/or the fuel canister gets
cold.

*Catalytic heaters are notorious for CO output when not running right.

*Ventilation may not be enough - if the wind is from the right direction if
may cause emissions to build up inside the vehicle.

With the advent of Carbon Monoxide alarms (I'm sure 12 volt models are
available at RV supplier - although I'll bet they're expensive), using one
if you are heating with gas would be a great idea.

Please note that I am not some tight-ass crumudgen that worries about every
little thing - I may use a propane heat in the future as well - but I do get
concerned that Rick's post will be used as a testimonial to the safety of
heating your bus this way by some impressionable folks.

&gt;I may open my self for a bombardment of conflict, but here I go.  We have
&gt;used a propane heater in our Westy for years and were recommended by many
RV
&gt;establishments that the westys design was one of which to permit such an
&gt;event.  Now vent windows need to be used and this is to include front
window
&gt;vents.  Just mount the heater (mobil or permanent) in a larger air space
&gt;allowing air current, and pop out the vent windows and wallah heat. not all
&gt;the way open but enough.  I was also encouraged to use a fan to blow on the
&gt;heating element all gases away from the sleeping quarters, here is where
the
&gt;front vents come into play.  I was even told that was why the front vent
&gt;windows rotate in both directions as easily as they do, to allow air
current
&gt;to better circulate out, yet to be scientifically documented(laughing).
But
&gt;done right is an absolute benefit to the occupant.  I'll continue to use
&gt;propane as a source of cooking and heat inside for as long as needed
&gt;regardless of others notions not to.  Also easy to hide fuel canisters.
