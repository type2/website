Subject: Adding a new VW to the fleet.

Hi Volks,

I realize that this is the bus list and this isn't totally on target, but I
need some quick info so I can get some parts on order for a '73 Super Beetle
we are adding to the fleet this weekend.  Most of them are just simple
maintenance items, so I will be ordering them from Bus Depot if possible.
Since I know that some of you guys also have Bug experience I will throw
myself at the tender mercies of your collective wisdom with a few questions:

1)  How many feet of fuel line will I need to completely replace all the
lines on a '73 Super with a stock single carb?  Is this the same 5mm line I
use for my '72 bus?

2)  The engine in the '73 Super has a B6 code.  My research tells me that
this is originally from a 1970 Beetle and should be a &quot;dual port, single
releif&quot; engine.  Now I am a little bit stumped as to what all of this means.
I'm a Type IV guy, I don't know about single ports vs. dual ports etc.  Is
there a website where I can go to learn more about the various
configurations?  Also, is there any way to visibly confirm that this is what
the engine is currently set up as without a major teardown?

3)  Anybody have a recommendation for good Type1 parts on the east coast?
