&gt; Having worked in the auto industry, and searched for good tires for my

&gt; a commonly stocked tire, you really have to know what you're asking for
&gt; or you may end up with MX4 passenger tires...

last time I needed tires I was told the MX was no longer avaliable, and
they wanted to sell me the MX4, ran and searched....finally found a dealer
who was willing to do a real search, and found the Michelin MXT truck
tire. (not light truck either)

the tires had to be special ordered but they have a 99S rating and handle
great.... so nothing is perfect...these buggers set me back a few $$$$$ I
believe it was almost $120 each balanced and mounted!

&gt; skeptical when I take my old VW's to anyone for service I'm not able to do
&gt; for the car myself.  I've even been told by the local VW dealer they won't

look for an older VW dealership, one that was there when your bus was new
