Subject: [T2] Starter Problems

Hi folks,
   As expected, the heat of summer(here in the USA) has brought with it the 
usual starter problems.  I'd like to tell you what i do to prevent the 
dreaded hot start problem.  Every year, in the spring or early summer I 
remove the starter at my convenience and at home in my driveway.  I 
completely disassemble it, clean, inspect, repair, lubricate, and reassemble 
the whole thing.  This includes polishing the armature.  While the wires are 
off, I also clean all the wire terminals until they shine.  Of course the 
battery is removed when I do this, so I tend to the battery and it's wiring 
then also.
   I've been doing this for about 10 years, and in those years I've never 
had a starter problem.  Also, this lets you deal with the starter where and 
when you want to. This procedure could prevent many of the problems some of 
you folks are having.  I believe this to be a better solution to the hot 
start problem, than the relay modification.  Once you do this, you'll know 
your starter is in good condition.
Hope this helps.
