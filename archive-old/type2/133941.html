Subject: Re: [T2] I just stripped the interior of my 73 Westy...

&gt; If I don't find another stock 73 kitchen to use, I'll just build a second
&gt; jump seat. IIRC, the 73 just had an ice box and a sink, right?

Here's another vote for skipping ice box and sink. I have a similar
aspiration to make a removable second rear seat. :-)  Ideally I would
like to make it double as a step into the bus (not sure what route for
proper cushion removal and height adjustment..), and push-around for
another seat at the table.
My setup doesn't have complete plumbing (default is not electric), or
the drain on the water tank, shelf door is water-warped and doesn't
close all the way, nasty rust-hole in floor, and 4 kids to haul, so I
had a bit of help with the decision to keep it in the garage.  Bottom
line: High maintenance, bleek returns.
The sliding door side shelf seems just right for setting a coleman
cooker on.  No experience actually *cooking* in that scenario.

No propane tank on my setup.

Would you be able to more easily fit your existing kitchen into a trailer?
