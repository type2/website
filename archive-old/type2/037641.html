Hi All

I recently became owner of a 1971 Westy, I would say in above average
condition. Unfortunately, I am junk yard challenged with only the bare body
left on the only two I could find.

However, I'll be in the San Diego area soon and I'm in hopes of some yards
to wander. If anyone out there in the SD area can pass some directions/names
my way I would appreciate it.

On the list so far:

under dash shelf

propane setup

decent tail light housings

things I can't live without

Thanks,

Pete
