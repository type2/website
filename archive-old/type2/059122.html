Subject: Bad 1.3/1.5/1.6L Dansk mufflers!

	I ordered a muffler &amp; associated tailpipe bits for my '70 bus from
Rocky Mountain Motorworks this week.  Opened up the box &amp; started to put
the pieces together on my living room floor to see how it all lined up.
Something didn't seem quite right...

	It turns out that the muffler exit port is on the wrong side!  (No,
I don't have the muffler upside down.;)  The tab for the damper is there on
the left where it should be, but the exit tube is about a foot and a half
farther down the muffler.

	After a long call to Rocky Mountain, they determined that their
entire stock of Dansk mufflers is likewise mis-manufactured.  They offered
to send me a Brazillian muffler as a substitute and issued a UPS call tag
for the return of the bad one.  They were also willing to ship the
replacement via 2nd day air, and they were even happy to credit me the $35
difference between Dansk and Brazillian mufflers -- *after* I reminded them
of the price disparity. :-o

	Heads up to any of you who buy a Dansk 1300/1500/1600 muffler, as
there appears to be a bad lot of them circulating.

	I wanna drive my bus! );
