X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

Last year about this time, one of the list members posted that he had
calenders available. He got them from Jack Scoville Ltd. in Corvallis Or. I
got one and I love it, but 2001 is coming. If this kind listee can get these
again I would love one. And yes this has Bus content, the calenders had
Buses all over them, Jack Scoville is a VW Dealer.
  Also, I have been looking around at other 71 Westies. It seems that the
paint varied. I have seen some with the Red paint like mine, but with White
above the belt line. I have seen others all Red with White only on the top,
and still others with all Red and no white at all, like mine. Was there a
standard? Everyone I have talked to says that there is &quot;factory&quot;. This is in
regaurd to Westies not just campers or Buses in general.
