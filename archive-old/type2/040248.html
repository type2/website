Subject: happy bloody birthday...engine won't idle

Today is my birthday, and to help celebrate this glorious occasion my 74 bus has decided to go kerbroken on me. She's got a California spec (smog pump, EGR box) twin carb (Solex PDSIT 2/3) 1800cc engine.
 Upon starting this morning, the engine turned over, fired and then died. The only way to maintain idle is to keep ones foot on the gas although once out on the road coasting along is impossible, even when moving in second gear, removal of said foot results in almost instantaneous silence from the engine. Yesterday I drove all over San Francisco in the 90 degree heat, up and down those steep hills with a full load in the back, with not a single complaint from the engine, but on starting this morning, well....
  So my hunch is a vacuum leak, I can hear a hiss from the engine compartment when the engine is run, I've checked all the pipes and they appear to be intact and are all in place, the brake booster pipe is OK, the manifold nuts are tightened at the heads and the carbs, all the wiring is present and correct on the central idling system, and the engine and the carbs were rebuilt only 800 miles ago. Where could the root of the problem lie? Has anyone else had a similar problem? This has occurred suddenly so I'm assuming that a hose or similar component has come astray, could the sudden heatwave be partly responsible?! All suggestions are gratefully received,

Paul,
