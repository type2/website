Subject: [T2] Re:Christmas lights on bus

Rick,
   I had the same thought, to put lights on my bus.  My plan is to move the 
spare tire off the nose and cut a piece of 3/4 plywood to go in it's place 
on the nose mount.  I'll cut the wood to a circular shape, paint it white, 
and then mount an artifical wreath with lights to the wood.  To power the 
lights I was going to get a low wattage inverter which would get wired to 
the battery through a relay which is energized by the headlight switch.
   Is it legal? I don't know, I guess I'll find out soon enough.
