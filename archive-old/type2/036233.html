Subject: Re: Fw: AIRS list printing?

To print a list of AIRS members you can highlight the members names you want,
put them in the clipboard (hold &quot;Ctrl&quot; and press &quot;C&quot;), and then paste them to a
word processor document where you can edit to your hearts content.  At least
with Microsoft, not very familiar with other operating systems.
