&gt; &gt;Also I noticed there is a difference in rear brake shoes during the 73
model
&gt; &gt;year (my bus year) at chassis number 213 210 2497.  My bus is 233 210
0455.  I
&gt; &gt;have read several accounts of VW going back and forth around the chassis
&gt; &gt;number switch to get rid of parts so..... Does any one know how to tell
the
&gt; &gt;difference in the two different shoes?
&gt;
&gt; I would like to know the answer to this too.  I seem to remember that at
&gt; one point in time, the rear brake shoes and drums became wider.  Was it
the
&gt; 1980 model year?  Can you swap wider shoes and drums from a Vanagon to a
&gt; loaf?

The shoe lining size is the same up to the end of Vanagons. 91 I believe.
250 x 55 x 6,0mm
The shoes themselves, are different because of the self-adjusters.
The drum is a different part # but I do not know why. type2 is 211 609 615
from 71 to 79. Vanagon is 251 609 615 from 80 to 91.
When my 77 Westy needs new rear shoes, I plan on using Vanagon parts =
backing plates, shoes, and maybe the drums if I have to. I want to convert
to self-adjusting brakes....one less thing I have to do. I already have
hydraulic lifters so I don't have to adjust valves and the Vanagon
electronic ignition so I am at a pointless existance.....
I have the wiper switch/harness/relay from a Champagne Edition bus to give
me intermittant wipers but I haven't installed them yet....the switch arm is
brown and it clashes with my black interior.....
