Subject: Re: [T2] Bus snobbery

&gt;Next time, try this.  Instead of a friendly wave, try the two step
&gt;approach.  First a big thumbs up followed by a point to the bus.  It will
&gt;work every time.

I have a 12&quot; tin VW symbol in the window of my Ch*vy Minivan for 
exactly this purpose.  I definitely want people to know I am a VW 
person, even if I'm not driving one at the moment.  Lots of people 
ask about the sign, which gives me a chance to tell them about this 
mysterious '78 Bus I never drive anymore but still love....  I was 
thinking about copying a picture of me and my bus to have to stick in 
other bus' wipers when I see them parked.

I usually wave, point to my sign, and try to yell &quot;I have a 78 Bus!&quot; 
It never really works, but it makes me feel a bit better.  :)

PS.  I'm hoping the new Microbus will be cheap enough for me to 
afford it.  I want one and I'm not afraid to admit it!
