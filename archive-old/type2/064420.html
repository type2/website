Subject: ignition relay and blown fuse: the adventure continues

Well, that overstates it a little, but I finally got a pocketful of new 
fuses [and a new supply of safety flares]  and am going out to work on the 
bus.  Per an earlier post, I checked the fuel cutoff, coil wire, etc.  
Best plan I can come up with now is put another fuse in and see what 
happens.
