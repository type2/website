Subject: RE: [T2] More Merc Wheel Info

A website I located says that the rim offset for VW van wheels is NOT 25mm,
but instead is 39 mm

Additionally, he indicates that the offset for the 6 inch stock alloy rims
sold as a Vanogon option is 30 mm.

This may change things insofar as using merc wheels goes.

here is the site:

Don't ask me to confirm this.
