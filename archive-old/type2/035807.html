Subject: engine overheating

Hey all,

A while back I posted that my 70 bus was overheating. I had checked
everything but to no avail. Just wanted to let everyone know what the
results were.

My husband finally fixed the problem. It turned out to be the head
bolts. You guessed it. They had come loose. Remember this was a fairly
new engine. So he pulled the engine retorqued the bolts to specs and
narry an overheat problem again.

Thanks,
Sharon
