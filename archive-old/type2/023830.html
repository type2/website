One more here!

Ok, a while back there was a thread on this, and I can't retrieve it, so I'm
hoping some of you might be able to conjure up a quick guide on how this is
done.
Ramona seems to have a lack of gettup and I am wondering if the throttle cable
needs tightening.
Some time ago her gas pedal went &quot;mooosh&quot; all the way to the floor and died,
and I fashioned a pine pedal and used a common hinge to affix a new one. It
works quite well, but I wonder if it somehow caused some slack in the cable
since it was most assuredly *not* an OEM pedal...
Also I will recheck the fuel pump, but thought I'd start here on the in-case.
Thanks again and happy Mona-Day*
