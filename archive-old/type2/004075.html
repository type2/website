You have given me answers to several questions, but
perhaps you can tell me why you never bothered to reply to the one below.
Neither did Bus Depot after several calls on my dime and a promise that
someone would get back to me. Joe sounds to me not as you describe him (it
would offend me to quote you) but more a person who decided to apply his
knowlege and skills towards starting his own business. *Your* attitude seems
to be that of  a crochety old mechanic who wishes he had done the same. I
applaud Joe's tempered response to you.

&gt; Thanks Karl. Bus Depot offers a Drive Flange Grease Cap, part # 002 517
&gt; 289A, 68-79 bus. Would you know if this is the part that may need
replacing?
