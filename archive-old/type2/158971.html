&gt; No other damage and nothing gone from my vehicle fortunately. I'm

Sorry to hear that Jules.

It happened to me during day time two days ago,  the guy try to steel my 
$100 cd player , he massacred the dash board and the cd player to 
extract it. he did not get it !!! Well  I wish he was a pro , take my CD 
player and did a clean job because its very ugly and damaged now. 
amazingly enough  , the CD player which look like ... a &quot;camel&quot; CD 
player is still working.

I had a used passenger windows for $10 from Tassi inc 
http://www.tassiinc_dot_com (people from the bay area (CA) , again , go to 
this place , its like a giant junkyard for our bus), I did not install 
it yet , but it looks a little bit tricky.
