Ian:

Store the Bus at your parents' house, and take the Escort for college.  You'll regret giving up the Bus, and they're not getting any cheaper or any more available.  You could drive/work on the Bus when you're home from college, and when you graduate, you'll have a cool vintage VW that you'll probably want to keep forever.

Good luck.

&gt;Howdy howdy,
&gt;
&gt;I don't know how much my question pertains to the list, but I figured if I got
&gt;it in as a &quot;friday question&quot; nobody would mind. 
&gt;
&gt;I am graduating high school this year and I own a 72 kombi, my first vehicle.  I
&gt;love and respect my van, I have learned a lot from him and feel a special bond
