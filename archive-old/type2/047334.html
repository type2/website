&lt;&lt; Is it possible to import one of them to the USA?? Do imported trailers go 
thru the same strickt import regulations as vehicles??&gt;&gt;
 
btw, I was wrong earlier about the eriba_dot_de address, as it appears that Eriba 
is located in the Netherlands, so try www.eriba.nl

I have no idea if you can import one of these.  They are not cheap.  I've 
heard the old ones going for as high as $5000, which is about the same price 
as a new one.
