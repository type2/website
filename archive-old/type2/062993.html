Subject: Sad Sucky Safari Saga

Today I called Wolfgang about my safaris.  Talked to a gent named Steve who
is s'posed to be the man there.  I explained the problem, and he invited me
to send them in and they would fix them, even tho they would have to
un-powdercoat them to re-spot weld them, meaning a significant turnaround
time.  Since selling the 911, the '56 is my only running bus (or car) so I
couldn't do that.  He promised to set aside one from the next batch for me.
We'll see.  

In general, he was nice about the whole deal.  I didn't rail on him like I
usually would have, since he did offer to fix them right away - ask some of
the vendors I deal with at work about what happens when stuff doesn't work!
Grrr!
