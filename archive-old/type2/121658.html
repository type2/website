Subject: Re: [VB] Painting in Cold Weather

Tommy,
	Since you are working on the under sides cosmetics are not so 
important.  After removing as much rust as you care to deal with, heat 
up the areas that you want to prime/treat/whatever with a hairdrier 
before painting.  The thing that you are doing with the heat is to drive 
out as much moisture as possible.  Painting cold damp metal is a bad 
idea!  Gary Gibson
