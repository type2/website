&gt; Speaking of swaybar bolts, the left side bolt is broken in the lower

&gt; parts, so...  I need to get the bolt out from the nut to about a 1&quot;
&gt; piece of the broken bolt that's still inside. We tried useing a wrench

Shawn,

That hole is not threaded.  Just take a punch and BFH and punch the broken
bolt thru.  If you have a short length of pipe to support the sway bar,
that's a plus, but the edge of a concrete step will do as a support.
