         I sure would think it'd have a problem -- the gearing is waaay
too tall for that engine. The 1600 engine buses had a 5.37 final drive,
that '79 -- unless you changed it -- has a 4.57. That alone would cause
overheating, I'd think.
          I personally wouldn't run any T1 engine without a external
cooler and filter.
