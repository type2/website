&gt;breathing apparatus is the way to go (not one of those .99 dust masks). Why
&gt;not error on the side of caution, it is your brains, lungs etc??? I can't
&gt;understand why people would wanna breathe that stuff in?? If anyone wants

Buy a respirator now or you'll need a more expensive one later, right?  I
agree with safety first, I think what stops people is the $$ or $$$ for a
good unit and the intangible rewards for the investment (i.e. longer life,
less health problems).   

Here's a hairball idea I've had (I currently don't have a breathing
apparatus aside from my own lungs, that is):  I was thinking of taking one
of those army surplus gas masks and fitting it with a long hose that I could
place outside my workspace near a clean air source.  It seems like an
affordable way to avoid paint fumes/sawdust--I don't know how large the hose
would have to be or the limits of its length for safe breathing--I figure
after passing out a few times for lack of 02, I'll eventually get it right
;).  I haven't tried making one yet, just thought I'd &quot;throw the idea in the
air.&quot;
