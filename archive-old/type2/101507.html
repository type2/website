&gt; Thanks everyone for the input! I just ran around with a friend to the FLAPS
&gt; and Advance. The FLAPS didn't have a plug and neither did Advance. I didn't
&gt; see anything at Ace Hardware that looked good enough.
&gt;
&gt; What I'm going to try is to clean up the old plug and use JB Weld to put it
&gt; back in. I'd love to tap out the hole but I just did an overhaul (not two
&gt; weeks ago). I'll fix this right the next time I have the engine apart.

It will take less effort to fix this correctly than it would to bodge it
with JB-Weld.

First, push a ball of paper towel material into the oil gallery a short
distance.  You will retrieve this with needle nose pliars when you are
through.

Tap the hole with the appropriate pipe-thread tap.  Anyone know the size
off-hand?

DO NOT FORGET TO PULL THE BALL OF PAPER TOWEL OUT OF THE GALLERY!  This
pulls any shavings out of the gallery.

Install appropriate flush pipe-thread plug with Allen wrench.  Use a dab
of non-hardening sealant on the threads.
