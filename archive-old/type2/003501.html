&gt; Remember to loosen the large castellated nut on the axle before you
&gt; remove the wheel.  It's the safe thing to do.

The original poster has a '78 Bus.  She does not have to undo the large
castellated nut to remove the brake drum.  The '78 has two little bolts that
become visible when the wheel is removed.  Once those are undone, the drum
can be removed.
