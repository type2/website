Subject: Re: [T2] timing and pinging question 

Good morning Mr Dolan,
      Boy do I feel like an idiot. I appearred
 to have made some mistakes in my email, 
and for that I appologize. I ran outside this 
morning and with a mirror and light I read
 the distrib #'s. 0231 1167 049. I was told
 it was a 50 but I guess it's a 049. My dwell
 is at 24 on the 8 cyl scale. I realize that .
016 is the initial setting, for the points.
 I need to bump that up to 25 which would
 be 50 on the 4 cyl scale. 
    The engine block is also a AE part 
number, which I failed to mention. My 
comment on vaccum was related to the
 hose condition and sucking on the 
advance. But no I have not used a guage. 
Timing is set to the notch in the pulley, with 
the vaccum hooked up. You have been a
 great help to me Mr Dolan and i appereciate 
you help on this problem that i have.
 
Paul Saulsbury
