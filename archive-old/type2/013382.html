&gt; Could I have put the starter in wrong?

probably not.

&gt; Is it really important which clips those little red wires
&gt; attach to the solenoid (fuel injection).

don't know....

&gt; Could a fault in the ignition
&gt; switch itself cause the solenoid to burn out?

it could just be that your ignition switch is bad.  &quot;A&quot; test for for this
is to give the key a &quot;firm&quot; turn from &quot;on&quot; to &quot;start&quot; -- not hard so you
break off the key, but &quot;firm&quot; so it goes all the way to the fullest 
&quot;start&quot;.

I found this to work and was indicative that my switch was toast.
(after I had my starter replaced, which needed to happen anyway)

&gt; P.S. Muir taught me to understand that working on a vw would teach me
&gt; valuable lessons...about myself..

no doubt!
