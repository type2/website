Hi Matthew,

Well, at least we can be pretty sure that your trouble is ignition based
now, so we are half way there.

This idea is only theoretical since I have never tried it personally, but it
seems like it should work from a simple common sense point of view as long
as your engine was assembled correctly.

Set your dwell at 47-50 degrees (.018&quot; should work if you don't have a dwell
meter) and rotate the engine to TDC on cylinder #1.  Next, turn your
distributor until the #1 indicator notch lines up with the rotor.  If all of
the ignition components in your engine were installed correctly, this should
time your vehicle to right around Top Dead Center, which should allow it to
start and run, although probably not too well.  From there you can bust out
your handy-dandy timing gun and tweak it into perfect shape.  Let me know
how everything goes.

						Good Luck,
							Jay
