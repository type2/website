Subject: Re: [T2] horn circuit

Warren, there is a hot wire going from the fuse box directly to the 
horn.  There is another wire that goes from the horn to the base of the 
steering column (not the shaft) and is ungrounded.  When you mash the horn 
button, the column is grounded to the wire that runs through the shaft and 
connects back down the shaft at the steering box ,completing the ground 
circuit, and causing the horn to blow.   I hope this helps.  Greg
