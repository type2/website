&gt; &gt;    &gt; How do I remove the cosmoline from my new engine case without

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;my dad, recalling post WWII surplus jeep parts shipped
&gt; &gt;in drums of cosmoline, says he thought the trick was a
&gt; &gt;kero soak then burn it off
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;your mileage will surely vary...
&gt; 
I removed all of the cosmoline off the entire bottom side of my 914/6 in
order to enter it in the full concours class car shows.  I tried just about
everything, but found that kerosene worked the best followed by degreaser
and water hose down.   Where the heat bakes it, it may take several
application cycles (kerosene/degreaser/water) to get it all off.  After the
cosmoline softened from the kerosene, I used a hard plastic spatula to
scrape it off.  It had a sharp edge., but didn't scratch anything.  (I hope
my wife doesn't see this email.)  Nice thing about kerosene is it will not
spontaneously explode, which could really ruin your day.  Good idea to keep
the hose handy just in case, along with a fire extinguisher that can handle
a grease fire.
