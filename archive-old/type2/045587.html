Subject: Re: [T2] Exhaust knowledge starved... (Pretty long)

Might want to get that cup of coffee now... (OK, &quot;Really long&quot;)

Possible permutation to my exhaust concerns (as originally, tentatively 
outlined in the below msg):  disconnected the tubes from exchanger-to-heat 
flaps; ensured that flaps open/close correctly; marvelled that the only 
thing holding the flap housing &amp; connected vent duct up was its attachment 
to the tube off  the front of the exchanger; tied them (temporarily) to the 
frame, made sure flaps remained closed; drove around to &quot;heat things up&quot;; 
backed it up on ramps &amp; saw &quot;the smoke.&quot;  Smoke about the same smell, color, 
density as has been finding its way into the cab.  Initial visual reveals 
little.  The smoke is wafting around near the front of the right exchanger, 
wind is pulling it out now &amp; then.  Oh, I'd also removed the tubes off of 
the rear of the exchangers (not sure why), so there's nothing blowing 
through the exchanger.

Now I'm:  1) considering if it is just a whole lot of oil soaked into the 
(asbestos?) matting - a) I didn't disassemble the exchangers, b) I was able 
to see the matting when I looked into the hot air port, due to the metal 
sheeting covering it being a little up at the edges;
2) wondering if, contrary to what you'd stated earlier (possibly thinking 
I'd removed the housing), there's some way to clean the inside w/out 
exposing the mat or getting (asbestos?) fibers airborne, a) or do I pull out 
as much of the matting as I can w/needlenose (or something).

I:  1) considered an oil leak, but from where? - a) valve cover seems OK, b) 
push rod tubes, filler tube, oil pump area the same (OK), c) there's a 
smidgen of wet oil on the strainer cover (gasket? after 1900 miles on 
rebuild?), d) I see one streak of oil on the block, looks like it came from 
the area where head &amp; case meet (holding breath) - one track, not copious, 
wet amounts;

2) Removed thermostat off of case (kept in bracket) &amp; cleaned ALL traces of 
oil off w/starter fluid (well after cool down - no new wet oil during the 
interval);

3) Threw in the oil rag for the day.

So, which way do I go (which way do I go)?  I WISH I had the dough right now 
to replace both my exchangers.  Not because I think they're necessarily 
strictly responsible, but because they're probably contributing some.  I 
don't think I've an exhaust manifold (_at_ the block) leak.  Also, the manifold 
in the exchangers (both pipes, four total) passed my hasty 'blow' &amp; hold 
pressure test.

Additionally, I can't be exactly certain that the smoke (that I'm not 
certain where/what it - smoke - originates from) isn't finding its way into 
the vents by getting through the tin &amp; into the blower fan housing. Oklahoma 
Bill K. filled me in on the two tubes running back through the front tin, 
off of a mystery cannister near the right rear wheel, &amp; told me where the 
tubes are supposed to connect:  the shorter onto the front, top of the air 
cleaner assembly, the longer into the tin near the # 2, through a hole.  The 
longer tube has a metal connector still in it; it isn't connected.  So I 
have a hole in my tin/easy (?) passage for smoke to enter the upper (above 
seal) engine compartment &amp; into the vents.  Not knowing the necessity level 
of the cannister/tubes aside, should I plug hole &amp; note difference?  On top 
of this, my front tin isn't as far forward as it might be.  There's a couple 
spots w/very small gaps, seal isn't pushed against engine compartment wall 
(I'm working on that).

Anyhow, I'm slightly befuddled right now.  Hoping if you've read this far, 
you might have a tactic I could employ (or point out one already suggested, 
but inadvertantly overlooked/disregarded).

Thank you very, very much,

 &gt; What gives w/the cloth &quot;net&quot; behind the metal lining of the heat 
exchangers?

Well... if it is what I think it is (the mat that sits between the outer
shell and the aluminum fins on the OEM VW heater boxes) then it is an
asbestos pad that VW installed back in the bad old days before asbestos
caused cancer.  It was installed to keep the heat from radiuating off the
box and improve the heat flow to the front.

I do not know (but doubt highly) if the Dansk replacement boxes have this
pad, or at least if it is still asbestos.

 &gt;   I was considering trying to use some sort of cleaning solvent to wash 
out
 &gt; the exchanger &amp; eliminate any oily/exhaust particle buildup that might be
 &gt; contributing to my smelly, smoky dilemma.  Would this backing (&amp; 
baffling,
 &gt; possibly insulative, I guess...) be harmed by rinsing the exchanger?

I would say leave it alone.  DO NOT clean it!  If it is intact and oil
soaked and hard as a rock, that is *GREAT*... it means that it can't shed
any fibers!  If it is nice and clean and fuzzy, then it can and will shed
fibers and they have a bad rep.  If you have removed the outer shell and
can remove this pad intact, I would do so. Replace it with a piece of the
hard high-temp fiberglass board.  Or just leave it out entirely.  The air
you get from the heating system will not be quite as hot, but it was never
very hot anyway :-)

 &gt; I went ahead &amp; tried my 'blow test' on the exchanger.  Just using my 
hands
 &gt; to cover the exhaust entry &amp; exit ports, I placed my mouth to the open
 &gt; exhaust port &amp; blew.  Once I'd adjusted my hands to ensure no air
 &gt; hissing/leaking (that I could determine), I continued to maintain 
pressure.
 &gt; For about as long as I could do that, I detected no noticeable decrease 
in
 &gt; pressure.  This tells me (I think) that I don't have a large hole in the
 &gt; exhaust.

Sounds like the exhaust-carrying tube is still fine.

 &gt; my exchangers have a little play between
 &gt; the housing &amp; the exhaust manifold.  I could see this working if I 
plugged
 &gt; the exhaust ports.  Should I have this space?  If not, how do I seal it 
up
 &gt; airtight (optimistically assuming I don't have to exchange my exchangers
 &gt; after all)?

I am not 100% clear on this... the shell is usually a bit loose on the
exhaust pipe.  It would be nice if it were completely sealed up and air
tight, but it is not the usual course of things.  I suppose you could try
a muffler bandage, I dunno, I have very low expectations in this
department :-)

 &gt; Also, I'd asked about a sealant to use on the exchanger-to-heat flap
 &gt; connecting pipe.  Should I seal the air ducts coming off of the blower &amp; 
on
 &gt; into the exhaust, as well?  I'm guessing yes, but I don't feel I've
 &gt; developed an uncanny VW intuition as of yet.

Well, Karl sent me a tube of MB super gorilla snot that I am gonna try
next time I have the system apart, but the black goop that I think was
original was a high-temp RTV variant.  Check with a heating contractor or
RV dealer, see what they recommend

And BTW, I don't feel I have developed one either... but I have only been
playing with them for 25 years :-)  Maybe eventually :-)
