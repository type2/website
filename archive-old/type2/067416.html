Subject: CV Joint Life Extension '80

A previous post extended the thought that flipping over an axle would 
apply wear to the *other* side of the bearing housings and races.  
I was counting on this *theory* yesterday to rejuvinate my right side 
CV joints.  Stared at joints long enough to realize that flipping 
axle over wears joints in SAME locations.  To actually get additional 
mileage out of joint the axle must be switched from side to side.  
Right axle must be re-installed on Left side, which CV (inner or 
outer) goes in or out is irrelevant.  Fuller, move lively whole story 
to come later. I know you just can't wait ! ! !
