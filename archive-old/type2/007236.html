&gt;     The auto manufacturers would not be allowed to operate a 20 yr old

&gt;     without the same requirements?  
&gt;     
&gt;     The time has come for the older cars to go the way of horses and burn 
&gt;     barrels.  How many cities will allow you to ride your horse down the 
&gt;     street leaving horse shit all over the place?  How many cities allow 
&gt;     you to burn trash and old tires in your yard?  Why should they allow 
&gt;     you to accomplish the same result with your old car?  And calling it a 
&gt;     hobby doesn't make it any cleaner or less dangerous.

        `What you seem to fail to understand is that it is not legal to
update ones 20 year old car to make it cleaner.  That would be a voilation
of the original equipment rule.  I am not permitted to put a catalitic
converter on my '74 thing (even if I wanted to do so) due to the original
equipment rule.  Updateing to a all new and cleaner engine type is made very
hard due to a myrid of obsqurely written and contridictry laws.  (BTW: the
current plan for the 181 is a VW diesel, I think it'll fit, I'm checking
with kennedy now)
