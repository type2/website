Subject: sooooooooore bloody hands
Message-ID: &lt;3772452F.153AF6E6_at_mail.ripon.k12.wi_dot_us&gt;

Advice:  Invest in an impact driver.
Reasoning:  After twisting the handles off of 3...yes 3 good
screwdrivers, a can of liquid wrench, sore hands, blood blisters on my
hands, and much frustration I reccomend it highly.

just don't use it where it will hurt anything

I took off my (1 piece) cooling tin off of the passengers side of the
engine.  I sanded it and painted it for something fun and non-stressful
to do.  It looks b-e-a-u-t-i-f-u-l!  I couldn't get the other side
off...here's why.  I like the passengers side of my engine.  It has a
bunch of gunky oily stuff all over it therefore the screws are easy to
get loose and cleaning is no problem.  The other side of my engine is
more rust and crust.... thats where I screwed up my screwdrivers.

I'm trying to remove my muffler.  I'm going to put in J-tubes once I get
the darn thing off!!  Anyone know how to get a muffler off with the
engine in on a 71??  It is a major PITA!
I would really love for someone to give advice!  I looked in Muir
archives etc...  I want to know how to physically reach the stuff and
actually do it.....
would it be better to drop the engine?? YIKES!! scary stuff!

help!

Thanks!
