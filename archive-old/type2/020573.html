[...]After removing the bumper, remove the rear valence body panel.  
Then you have a clear path to pull the engine straight out the back, no 
need to jack the bus up at all.  It's way easier than a beetle.

&gt; Bill,

&gt; I have successfully removed an engine from a bay without jacking the bus
&gt; at all.  You need to do two things... First, remove the rear bumper (this
&gt; may be harder than it looks, you may have to grind off a bolt head or
&gt; two). Second, tilt it off the jack onto the floor and drag it out.  The
&gt; clearance is tight, but it will definitely come out.  The case will drag
&gt; over a solid concrete floor with minimal &quot;brightening&quot; of the bottom of
&gt; the case.  If you want to be more civilized about it, there is room for a
&gt; mover's dolly *barely*.  If you want to use John Hartranft's dolly, you
&gt; have to jack the bus, but only a couple inches.
&gt; 
&gt; One idea I have had, but not tried is:  Get 1 3'x4' and 1 3'x8' sheet of
&gt; plywood or Masonite (hardboard), put two or three sheets of plastic
&gt; between them and put that plywood-plastic-plywood sandwich on the ground
&gt; beneath the engine.  Using a standard floorjack and 1' length of 2x12 (as
&gt; a softener between the engine and jack) you lower the engine as far as you
&gt; can, then tilt the engine up on one set of cyls and remove the jack.  At
&gt; this point you should be able to slide the top piece of plywood and the
&gt; engine out from under the bus, no trouble.
