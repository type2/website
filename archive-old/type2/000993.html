Can anyone diagnose my problem?  My 77 withnewly rebuilt engine has 20 feet
on it (0 miles) and I cant get it to go any farther. I am told to keep the
rpm up initially. This can be accomplished after 3-4 starts-and-dies if I
really beg it and almost over-rev it. Otherwise the thing rev's down and
dies on its own.
    Some smoke comes from the exhaust area with a &quot;something's burning&quot;
smell--could be the permatex on the triangle gaskets, one of the newly
painted parts, or a problem. I figure its one of the first 2 and it will go
away with drive time.
    AVP told me the best thing for the new engine would be to drive
immediately...medium speed and thru the rpm range.  I tried to get out of
the driveway but I could not get up the slight hill to the road. Revved it,
but letting off the clutch wanted to kill it.
    I am afraid my ever-so-loved bus of 8 years has become a huge drain on
the emotions, wallet, and sanity of my family.  The bus has been parked for
many months while I try to do things right...I have forgotten how to time
the damn thing perhaps--rotor to crack in dizzy, pulley notch to 7.5btdc,
timing light to green coil wire with key to &quot;on&quot;, turn dizzy to where light
just kicks on...I have to turn the dizzy counterclockwise until the light
comes on to get the bus to start at all--is this right?
    Any ideas as to why it wont run? This westy has become one expensive
driveway ornament. God I miss the days when I could jump in and go ANYWHERE
without the first worry. Now thousands later I fear it may never hit the
road. Thanks for listening!
