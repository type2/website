Subject: Re: [T2] Door locks

&gt;Well, it was available a couple of years ago, and the part number is on
&gt;the library page.  Wouldn't hurt to give the dealer a call.
&gt;
&gt;When I did mine, I used a generic spring from Home Despot.  One spring for
&gt;a buck and I cut and bent the ends to make two springs the correct length.
&gt;

What about the spring on the top of the mechanism towards the inside handle?
It is a one-turn spring that allows you to unlock the door from the 
inside as it pulls on the lock lever. Mine on the driver side is 
broken.
Thanks,

Rogelio
