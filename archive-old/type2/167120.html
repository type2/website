Subject: RE: [T2] RE: removing rubberized undercoated on the
  undercarriage

I'm looking to do the same with my '74.  Aside from expensive sand/ice
blasting any other suggestions?  Is there a product that can remove the rubber
protection?  Or is elbow grease the best solution?&gt; my 30 year old rubberized
undercoated in coming off the undercarriage of my&gt; 1976 bus. Its great to see
the original blue paint i live in bridgeport ct&gt; does anyone know of any
bussiness in the area they will blast off off the&gt; old rubberized coating
before i want to repaint it or not repaint it since i&gt; garage it durning the
winter any information would be great
