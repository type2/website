Guy:

Burning or leaking?  Take a look at the engine carefully;  it sounds more like an oil leak that is flinging oil all over the place.

Unfortunately, with the type iv you've got lots of places to leak from....
Good luck!.

&gt; Hi folks
&gt;
&gt; I've just been on a long trip from Plymouth (UK) to Anglesey, North Wales (UK) whilst the van went fine (1974 1800cc Westfalia) it took nearly a quart of oil in some 680 miles. I noticed on getting home the rear of the Van was covered in tiny specks of oil. Question is can I get away with just new rings or am I looking at new barrels and pistons complete? I have yet to strip the engine for inspection.
&gt;
