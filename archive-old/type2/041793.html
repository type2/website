Subject: Re: 84' seats in 77' bus?

does this mean if you swaped the seat track it would fit right in.just drill 
out the tack welds on both seats and tack in the vanagon seat tracks. did all 
else seem to fit with the front of the seat height to the steering 
wheel.thanks for any info as i would like to try this on my 69-westy.  all my 
best from florida.
