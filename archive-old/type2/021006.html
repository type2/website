Here's a question I'm asking myself a lot lately: http://images.amazon_dot_com/images/P/0471379077.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

The other 69 (my third bus) is still promised to me but the PO &quot;hasn't
gotten around to cleaning it out yet.&quot; I think he's having anticipatory
separation anxiety, as he's owned the bus for over a decade. :-)

Here's a biiiig picture of the 69 Euro-Westy's instrument cluster:

It's different. I guess that's Gen, Brights, Headlamps, and Oil
Pressure. Nothing seems to be hooked up except for the Gen light. Same
goes for speedo and fuel gauge. I need to pull the dash and check the
connections, because all seems fine at the back end.
