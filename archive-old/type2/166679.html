Subject: Re: [T2] Brake booster shot?

Jason,

Have you checked your brake booster vacuum line? Its a 15/32&quot; vacuum
hose that comes off the engine and runs up along the driver side frame
rail to the brake booster.

If you've still got the original line in place it is certainly worthy
of inspection and likely replacement.

Also, what year bus?

peace

&gt; I heard whenever I hit the brake that was coming from the area of my front
&gt; wheel. I looked around there, but could not see any obvious leaks.
