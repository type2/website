&gt; foamboard, 38.5x57.25&quot; was found in place of the cot on certain
&gt; European models at least back to 1971; I had one from Germany.  The
&gt; foamboard is our headboard now on our bed. It utilized the sunroof body
&gt; as did the cot option. Once you climbed up through the gap in the rear,
&gt; another piece flipped up to fill the gap.  It hinged in front and had
&gt; grabber forks in the rear so it could stay up with the poptop when the
&gt; roof hold-down  grabbers were inserted into the forks.  I have pics;
&gt;  can send to list members.

Hey Guys  I have seen this set up on a 72 bus before  very different and much 
better than the cots  later and have fun  Mark Dearing
