Subject: Re: [T2] Insurance

We have been for years with Good Sam on an RV status (including their 
Emergency Road Service, which will tow you VW for 400 mi if that is the 
nearest place that can work on it)- their insurance started as National 
General, then went to GMAC.  How can they be different, Good Sam and 
GMAC?  They let you drop a vehicle for 6 mo (the RV in winter) and keep 
it minimally insured as &quot;comprehensive&quot;.  We do not have collision on 
the busses, but do use comprehensive, so if you hit a deer they will pay.
Don't have the policy in front of me, but we keep on 4 vehicles, one 
with full collision (2004 Subaru) for about $500 per 6 mo.

John: $110 per *year*?
  We are in Red Bluff, California. All good driver and multi-vehicle
  discounts. Don't have a homeowner's insurance discount though.

  Good Sam has been
  trying to get us, but their quote is $165/year.
