&lt;&lt; Has anyone tried or know someone who has tried to put a hatch over the 
engine in one of the earlier bays?  My 72 doesn't and it was suggested I 
tried this.....now, before I start looking for a lid to put into it...does 
any have anything to suggest or to take into consideration...?

thanks &gt;&gt;

Were I to try this, I'd cut a large section of the package tray out of the 
donor
bus to ensure that the lid would fit. I'd slice it out with a thin metal 
cutting
disc rather than a torch to avoid distortion.
