Subject: Re: [T2] Gas leaks?

Just ordered mine. One of my issues with extinguishers is depending
on the type, how effective is it and how much damage will it do to
my engine. Yeah, the fire is out, but now you have an engine compartment
full of crap.  Looks like this one is effective and leaves no harmful
residue. Hopefully I won't have to find out.

&gt;&quot;Safe to Use on Car and Driver:
&gt;FireAde 2000 has a PH of (7) Neutral. Unlike traditional fire
&gt;extinguishing agents, FireAde 2000 is safe to be applied directly onto
&gt;your engine and racecar without any worries of damage from the agent! Can
&gt;even be applied directly to the driver.&quot;
