Subject: Oil Rings - 2 piece or 3 piece

&gt;People&lt; have told me that they prefer the 3 piece oil ring over the 2 piece 
&gt;oil ring.  Now that I have removed the rings from an extra set of pistons, 
&gt;and I have closely examined the 2 piece oil ring construction, I can 
&gt;logically agree that the three piece oil ring is prefered over the 2 piece 
&gt;oil ring.

WHY is the 3 piece better than the 2 piece oil ring??
