&gt; That's good advice, but it's not that simple to adjust.  You have to

This is true and not true... once again the variation thru the years will
catch you if you are not careful.  There were three different systems for
adjusting the front wheel bearing used on different vintages of buses:

Splitties used a double nut and tabbed washer.  This washer is indeed not
reusable (tho many try :-)  It *is* widely available and fairly cheap tho,
but be careful to get the bus one, as there are a raft of people selling a
tabbed washer with a hole that is too big for the stub axle.

For early bays ('68-71) I am not sure (see below)

Later bays ('72-79) use a clamp nut with a socket head bolt in it that is
quite reuable and a makes adjusting wheel bearing a simple procedure.  

Vanagons use a nut with a peen-able ring around the top.  These are not
only not reusable, but are $5/per from VW only :-( My least favorite
system, by far!

I *believe* that the change from double-nut-and washer to the clamp nut
came at the same time as the change from split to bay in '68, but it could
have been with the change from front drum to front disk brakes in '71.  I
have not owned a '68-71 bus, so I am not certain what system was used on
them.
