Subject: Re: [T2] 2.0L AFM whistle

Hi Craig,

had this type of sound on my first rebuild (stock 2.0 dual carbs), too.
Of course this can be an exhaust leak, or a vacuumleak.
Just let me tell you what I experienced (even if this is a worst case
scenario):

First though of the carb-flaps. VW-Guy told me if the bi-metal spring (on
the carbs) is broken or not soo tight the flaps can make a sound like this.
Engine did run great for about 8000miles. Then suddenly no compression on
cylinder #1, smoke coming out the side of the engine. Adjusted valves, still
sounded like a steam-machine (and smoked like one, too). After driving home
3000miles (since I was on a bus-trip) on just 3 cylinders I put out the
head:
Cylinder-Head-Sealing burned through, some big piece of the head molded away
just where the sealing should be. (Cylinder only had a small dent, cause
it's material is a lot more heat-resistant)
This was because of the head not put on correctly (e.g. sealing did get out
of place or head not tightened enough). The whistle was apparently the hot
compressed air getting forced out between head, sealing and cylinder.
Get that head off and check sealing-surface, sealing itself and the
cylinder-sealing-surface for small cracks, ...
Also check if you have sealings of equal thickness! There exist DIFFERENT
sizes (one is just twice as thick as the other) on the market here in
Germany, even if you buy two of them at the VW-dealer they sometimes give
you a mixed pair! (get the thicker ones if you can get them, especially if
the sealing-surface is not perfectly smooth)
Check the bolts for rust and get new cylinder-nuts. (if there is some dirt
on them, you cannot tighten them the right way)
Put the head back on and tighten the nuts just a bit more than recommended.
(done this almost 10 times on different typeIVs without any problems).

I don't want to scare you, but this is what I did. I had to get another new
head, since the old (almost new) one was far from being in decent shape. No
whistling since then, head on for about 2 years, drove 80000 miles, no
problems.

I hope its something else,

Timo


P.S.: Retighten the nuts without checking whats wrong with the head is no
good idea!!! Misplaced sealing can damage the sealing-surface or the bolts
can come out of the motorblock!

Subject: [T2] 2.0L AFM whistle


&gt; The story goes like this. My first rebuild, got the engine to fire
&gt; up, exciting. 1981 stock 2.0 F.I.in which I removed the aftermarket cruise
&gt; control an AC stuff. This is also my first veedub, enchanted. Asides from
&gt; the rough idle and the near overwhelming fear of overheating her, I've
&gt; encountered a whistling that, to the best of my knowledge is coming from
&gt; the AFM unit itself. I listened to it with the air filter off and on. It
&gt; nearly sounds like a type of whistle from a bad seal on some front door
&gt; windows. With higher rpm's it seems to go away and at near stall the noise
&gt; gets chirpier.
&gt;    Could it be the alternator, the blower fan ...?
&gt; Any help would be appreciated.  Thank you, Craig
&gt;
