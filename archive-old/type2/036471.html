Subject: Co detector Question

Hi volks,
Just bought a CO detector for the bus.  I was reading the instructions and it
says do no mount anywhere the temp gets below 40 degrees F.  Anyone know why?
And if I can still use it considering it will get below that (not much) at
night when no one is in the bus.
