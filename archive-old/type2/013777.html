roger,
when i got my riviera it didnt have the top mattress
in it.  i just bought a nice used late westy mattress
for the westy top bunk and it fits just fine.  by
looking at it, the riviera ones might have been just a
tiny bit smaller but the westy mattress fits just fine
and works well.

&gt; Anyone have any ideas on replacing the top bunk in a
&gt; Riviera penthouse pop 
&gt; up? Anyone done any interesting improvisations? Or
&gt; is there a place you can 
&gt; still order these beds?
&gt; 
&gt; thanks, roger
