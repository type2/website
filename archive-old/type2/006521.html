      George sed:

&gt; &gt; Disadvantages of wide tires include increased stress on the bus' rather
&gt; &gt; fragile steering box and steering linkage when turning the wheels at a
&gt; 
	And someone else sed:

&gt; I'm still of the opinion that this is bunk...but thats me.;)
&gt; 
	So I sez:

	Well our day care provider's son had a &quot;big tough truck&quot;*
	that had huge tires on both ends. He also had a little pan
	under the steering box to catch the power steering fluid
	seemed to be always leaking out. He also didn't seem to be able to
figure
	out why he had changed several steering boxes due to blown seals.
	When I suggested it was the big tires, he thought I was nuts, even
though he
	hadn't had any trouble for a few years, and then after he put the
monster tires on it, 
	he was doing two steering boxes a year?

	* Ask me sometime about the time I pointed that my 'cute little how
can you possibly
	get hard when you drive that thing' VW van could carry more than
twice as much as 
	his big tough virile Viagramobile;-) I started the conversation by
innocently asking if his 
	truck was a three ton, or a five ton, and then expressed total shock
and surprise when he told
	me it was &quot;just a half ton&quot; 8-P
