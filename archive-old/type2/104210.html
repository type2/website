Subject: Mystery Wire on 72

I have found a mystery wire on the 72 deluxe I am
working on. It is Gray and one end leads into the
engine compartment, the other end is connected to the
front of the transmission, however it is NOT the wire
for the back up lights, those two wires connect to the
tranny on the left side, this one is connected just
forward of these wires. I cannot find this wire on the
wiring diagram I have, and this wire is NOT present on
either my 71 or my 79.
So anyone know what it is?
