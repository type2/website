Bill,

     I get the same smell but only when I fill up.  My vent lines to the
fuel tank are bad.  I need to drop the tank &amp; replace all the grommets &amp;
vent lines.  For me, the smell goes away after a few miles.

&gt; List
&gt;
&gt; Finished the AVP engine installation and it went very well. The engine
runs
&gt; fine, has a couple of hundred miles on it, but still runs a little warm.
&gt;
&gt; First snow this morning, so I used the heater/defroster (has been used
with
&gt; the new engine with no problem). Twice on 5 mile trip I smelled RAW gas
&gt; through the defroster vents. All hoses in engine compartment are tight and
&gt; there is no gas smell in engine area or under the westi with engine off or
&gt; running. Rear heater ducts and hoses were checked and tightened last
&gt; weekend.
&gt;
&gt; Any ideas on a source and correction for my new problem?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for any ideas.
