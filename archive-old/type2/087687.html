Subject: Re: [T2] towing question

At 09:33 AM 4/23/02 -0400, you wrote:
&gt;One thing to always remember about a tow dolly is that two of
&gt;your wheels are on the ground.  In some states, two wheels on
&gt;the ground means you must have the vehicle registered and insured.

This is a real good point I forgot to mention as well, in fact it is
pretty much the case in most states now days.  In WV this
isn't a problem (so much) as you can title and register a car
without the car being present yet if you have the title.  Or you
can chance it.  Nobody has fortunately stopped me yet, and
I always seem to have a &quot;close&quot; plate when I need it anyway.
