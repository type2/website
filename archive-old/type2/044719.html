Subject: [T2] Greaseless in Seattle seeks Grand Poohbah with Lodge... and truck!

Hi Volks,

Karen and I are getting  our '79 Westy soon and are looking for a motor
mentor in the Seattle area.  Scott Solomon generously offered to give us a
hand and a place to work, but his shop isn't built yet and it will quite a
ways south of us.  Thank you very much though!  (Great guy!!!)

When we get our new bus, we'll need to pull and rebuild the 2.0 liter but
have neither the garage or experience to make it a pleasant process.  We're
considering renting a storage unit and rebuilding the engine there, but
would still lack a mentor/guru/poohbah who could offer some advice, etc.

Ideally we would like to work in someone's Volks loving garage with a
charismatic mechanic teacher person(s) and give them the money that would
have gone to the Storage Unit plus something for the help!  We both learn a
lot better and quicker with a human being than with just a book and a greasy
keyboard and monitor!

I'm fairly mechanically inclined, and do as much of my own wrench jockeying
as I am comfortable with, but flinch at the idea of rebuilding an engine all
by my lonesome.   Karen is a self proclaimed girl with aspirations of
becoming a woman who knows how to use tools.  She's off to a good start but
gets frustrated pretty easily.

I work on Mac's and PC's for a living at the UW and would love to trade
those skills for some V-dubbin' expertise as the pay here... we'll it sucks!
I'm looking for a job working in the service of the Bourgeoisie, who know
how to mistreat their employees at a better price!

On another note, does anyone have a vehicle with a tow package that could be
coerced, cajoled, bribed or suckered into helping us tow our 79 out of the
backwoods of Tacoms/Graham WA??

Thanks!!
