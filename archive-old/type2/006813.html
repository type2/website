Subject: 74 Westfalia for sale in Portland, OR


74 Westfalia bus for sale in Portland, OR.

It has the full width bed in the pop-top that sleeps 2. (much more 
comfortable than the narrow, canvas cot in the earlier westfalias.)  The rear 
bench seat is also full width.
  
It has a stock 1800cc engine (minus the egr/air pump) that runs great. (AW 
code).  Odometer reads 78,600 miles. 
Heater boxes, control flaps and cables all in good shape and work well.

Extensive lower body panel replacement has been done so the body is in good, 
but not excellant condition.  There is rust in the right rocker and in the 
panel below the windshield.  Replacement panels are included for both repairs.

New poptop seal.
3 window canvas top and screens all in good shape with no tears, includes 
rear hatch screen.
Excellent interior; upholstery and curtains are all original with no tears.
Upper and lower bed, front child's cot
Left side and overhead rear cabinets, fold down table, single seat with 
bottom storage locker behind driver's seat. 
Propane stove, 12v/110v fridge.
Two battery system with isolator.
AM/FM cassette stereo.

$1750

My new 79 westfalia has proven itself and I do not need two buses (though it 
is fun seeing them in the driveway together!)  The 74 needs to go to a good 
home.
