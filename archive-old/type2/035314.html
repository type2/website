Subject: all of a sudden...

Hi everyone,
    My 69 Westy has been doing great this winter. Thanks to NOS heat
exchangers from Bus Depot (no affiliation other than satisfied customer),
I've been warmer than ever. The bus heats faster than my wife's 95 Suburu!
It had been getting 18 to 22 mpg on a rebuilt 1600 dp w/ 10K. That was then,
this is now: all of a sudden I have no power. Hills that I could make at 50
to 55 mph in 4th need 3rd gear now at 35mph. My mpg has decreased to around
13-14 mpg. When I accelerate, there is a sound that resembles an exhaust
leak. The exhaust system doesn't appear to be holey (it is only 2 years
old). Any ideas on what could be responsible for this drastic change? Any
ideas on what to check first?
Thanks in advance,
Jeff Mitchell
