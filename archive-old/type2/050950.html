Subject: [T2] broken stabilizer bar

Yesterday my front end started making a clunk clunk noise when I hit bumps in 
the road. found out this am that my stabilizer bar is now in two pieces. not 
sure what caused it as I have only been doing highwy driving lately. Anyway, 
I was wondering if the bar from a 71 would fit, since I have a POS 71 bus, 
but I seem to remember someone posting about a 71 beam being slightly wider 
than a 68-70.   Will driving with it broken cause any damage to the front 
end? The metal clamps that go around the bar look like they would be a pain 
to put back on, any tips?

thanks
