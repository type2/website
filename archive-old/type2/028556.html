Hello Volks Folks,
Have a '69 van, I purchased awhile back and do believe I need to clean the
airbox out underneth the dash.  Reason is: the vent covers were gone, and
when I turned the fresh air on, some pieces of the ventcovers blew out. 
How difficult is it to take this apart to clean out?  Can't find anything
in the Bently covering this.  Anyone ever taken one apart?  Is it worth it?
gone,
Mark Cochran
'69 delivery van
