Subject:  Re:grounding engine/trans

I heartily second checking the three &quot;electronic&quot; grounds.  VW put them in
&quot;less than sensible&quot; locations for such critical connections.  After some
strange starting problems I cleaned all mine thoroughly and re-do it on a
regular schedule (spring and fall).  Made most, if not all, of my FI/Ign
probs go away. My first check at ANY sign of fuel/Ign fault.  I have
considered adding a better ground connection in a better location but
since it runs well when the originals are clean I have yet to do so.  BTW
I replaced ALL of the cheesy connections on the ground location near the
fuse block on my '83 vanagon.  12 volt wiring loves clean connections,
after checking the brake fluid and changing the oil it is the best thing
one can do for an AC vehicle. jon

&gt;     Then all you'd need for insurance is another ground wire piggied
from
&gt; the battery negative to the engine?

Yup, and I have seen this. It is not a bad test if you think this may be a
problem, but I prefer to do it as the factory did.  Extra wires make
pulling the engine more of a PITA than it usually is.  There is nothing
like discovering some extra PO-installed wire with the engine half way
down.

&gt; BTW, didn't the &quot;brain&quot; (MPC) have its own ground wire?

Yes it does, three of them as a matter of fact. but the &quot;feed&quot; for those
grounds are wires that connect to lugs the engine case under the intake
plenum. If the case is not grounded, the FI is not grounded.
