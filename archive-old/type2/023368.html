Subject: RE: [T2] whomp whomp...

I had the same problem on one of my buses and it turned out to be a left
rear tire separating. I thought it was a front at first but after a real
close inspection it was a rear. Felt like a front but then logic kicked in
and I realalised that my steering wheel didn't have any different feel in
it, so it had to be a rear.

George Lyle, as always, spoke true:  Try a different tire on that corner.
If 
your spare is questionable, swap the front left for one of the rears and see

what you get.  That should give you a definitive answer on whether it's the 
wheel/tire or something else.  

I'd guess you've got a bad tire (defects from the manufacturer are not 
uncommon) or more likely a bent rim.  Most modern tire shops can check your
rim 
for runout, but you can check it yourself for major problems just by
spinning 
the tire and using a screwdriver braced on a brick to hold it steady.  

Jack up the bus and put a stand under it.  Spin the tire by hand and move
the 
screwdriver and brick until it is just short of touching the outside edge of

your rim.  It should stay the same distance both side-to-side, and
up-and-down 
all the way around.  Do this on the inside and outside of the wheel.  You
can 
also check for an out-of-round tire the same way by positioning the
screwdriver 
along the tread.
