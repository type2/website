Subject: Curtains, I tell ya, curtains. ('66)

No, its not dead, it just has curtains in it now :-) .

Over the last few days, Janice and I made curtains for the '66.  I wanted
to get this done because I'm planning to sleep in the vehicle at the
Jerome Jamboree this coming weekend.  I figured I'd tell a little about
it for the list.

This 1966 standard microbus had a camping conversion done at some point
in it's past, probably when it was new but I'm not sure about that.  The
parts of the conversion that remain after 30 years are fold-out-into-bed
back seat and curtain rods above and below all the windows behind the
front seats (7 windows).  There is a hole in the floor behind the passenger
seat that looks like its for a drain from a sink or icebox but the
sink and/or icebox has vanished into the past.

The curtain rods are very simple pieces of flat spring steel, cut to length,
rounded on the ends, and fastened to the inside of the bus with screws.  There
are some thick washers between the rods and the body of the bus to space the
rods out from the walls bout 1/8 inch.

I bought 6 yards of material with a small red and white checkered pattern
and 6 yards of light-proof white lining material.  From this we made 16
curtains and 16 strips for tying open the curtains.  There are two curtains
on each of the 6 small windows, two wider curtains on the back window, and
two large curtains that hang from a curtain-rod that is fastened across the
top of the bus just behind the front seats to block off the front cabin.
The tying strips are just long pieces of material folded and hemmed that I
use like rope.  All this makes the bus look nicer, sort of homey.... (not
to be confused with homely, which it already was :-) )

The only disadvantage to having all these little windows (which I generally
like) is that there are a lot of curtains to open and close and tie back
when you sleep in the bus.  (and I sort of enjoy doing even that.)

Janice wouldn't let me touch her sewing machine so I just did all the
measuring and cutting, she did the hemming.  If anyone wants more details,
lemme know.  (The material cost me about $90 and that was on sale, it is
very nice, sturdy, woven material and the lining really keeps the light out.)

In the name of Saint Pon,
