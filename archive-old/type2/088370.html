Howdy list.

Well I am so close to finishing Uh-Oh but my cash has dried up. So I am =
trying to unload my little beater beetle. If anyone in California (near =
Modesto) is looking for a beetle as a little cheap transportation car =
then please pmail me and arrange to come have a looksie. I dont want to =
sell but priorities are priorities. I want to be driving my bus.

If anyone is curious, I have posted a couple of more pictures at =
http://personal.seraphnet_dot_net/photo_album/

I also put together my parts wish list.

Anyway thanks for the rant space.
