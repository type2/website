Subject: Remove gas pedal

On a 76 is the pin on which the gas pedal pivots supposed come out?  My pedal
has one of the hinge points gaped to the point it can be removed with the pin
in place, but I suspect this is not right and why my pedal feels floppy.  I
know that on my 181 the two holes are the same size and the pin is just pushed
out the side to free the gas pedal.  However, on my 76 bus the pin is so
rusted I can't tell if is is fixed or not.  I gave it a few good whacks with
the punch and hammer but it didn't budge.  I don't want to beat too hard until
I know it's supposed to move.
BTW - guess how many hits to get in the achive when you search for any
combination with &quot;pedal&quot; in it....
Thanks!
Mike
