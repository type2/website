Subject: Re: [T2] 009... Why?

Since they were very inexpensive, and all the parts stores had them
available, they were pushed as the &quot;best&quot; thing to put on your car; after
all, all the race cars had them! But race cars just have 2 settings, idle
and full throttle, and the 009 is fine for this. It is NOT fine for
everywhere in between.
