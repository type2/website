&gt;Okay I'm stumped so I thought I would ask all of you good folks.

I could go on trying to explain but a picture and all.

Go to www.tirerack_dot_com

under wheels, wheel tech, offset.

should clear up your questions, offset is distance from a hypothetical
center line.  Some manufactures also give backspacing, distance from
back of rim to the mounting surface.  A 10mm offset change shouldn't
much hurt anything, the stock difference between Vanagon alloys and steels
is more than that, BUT you have to mount em and actually see if
anything rubs to know for sure and a bigger offset is more wheel inside
the wheelwell where it does have a chance of rubbing.

Looking at your question, say the 6&quot; and 5.5&quot; wheel have the same 25mm
offset (about an inch) that means for the 5.5, from the mounting surface
to the outside edge is (2.75&quot;-1&quot;) about 1.75&quot; and from the mounting surface
to the inside is about (2.75&quot; + 1&quot;) for 3.75&quot;.  You add or subtract the offset
from half the nominal width of the rim.  For the 6&quot; wheel with a 25mm offset
the numbers are (3-1) = 2&quot; and (3+1) = 4&quot; inches respectively, a trivial 1/4&quot;
each direction.  If the offset stays the same, it works like this, the wheel
grows evenly each way.  Now I know 6&quot; Vanagon alloys fit a '78 Bus just
dandy so I'd guess a 6 x 15 will also fit with same offset assuming tires
don't rub anything.  Moving up to a 35mm (about 1.4&quot;) offset means a bit
more to the inside of the car and less to the outside say 4.4&quot; toward the
inside, 1.6 to the outside.  Get the idea, draw pictures it helps.  And
remember
that all rim widths aren't created equal when you get into alloys anyway.
