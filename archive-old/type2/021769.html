Subject: Re: [T2] Stuck valves and promises

I would do the method that Karl described in his post to the list on
finding cylinder 1, tcd, and then put the shaft in place.  Then install
the distributor and see how it situates itself and what direction/plug
in the cap the rotor is pointing towards (hopefully towards the notch on
the distributor rim).  Then put the cap on, hook up spark plug 1 to the
terminal that the rotor's pointing at and then plug the rest of the
cables in the cap in the appropriate places. (1234 counter clockwise
from 1)

Make sure that you put the driveshaft in the correct way.  Be sure to
note that one side of the groove is fatter.  If you flip it, the
distributor will be off 180 degrees.

That should work unless, like karl said, your cam shaft is not aligned
with the crank.  that would suck.

&gt; &gt; Thomas,
&gt; &gt; When the rotor is pointing at cylinder 2, it's actually cylinder 1
&gt; &gt; that's firing!  Then when it's pointing at 1, it's 2 that's firing; 3 is
&gt; &gt; 3 and 4 is 4.  The 1 and 2 cables are flipped!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; There is a groove marked on the metal distributor housing (with cap
&gt; &gt; removed) that indicates when the rotor is in position to fire cylinder 1
&gt; &gt; (doesn't necessarily indicate TDC because the distributor may be
&gt; &gt; turned).  That mark should be pointing to the back right (passenger) or
&gt; &gt; 5 o'clock.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; normal config:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 3    ______     1
&gt; &gt;     /       \
&gt; &gt;    | 3     2 |
&gt; &gt;    | 4     1 |
&gt; &gt;     \_______/
&gt; &gt; 4               2
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; or with a flipped drive dog:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 3    ______     1
&gt; &gt;     /       \
&gt; &gt;    | 1     4 |
&gt; &gt;    | 2     3 |
&gt; &gt;     \_______/
&gt; &gt; 4               2
&gt; 
&gt; whoa.  ok, now i'm seriously confused.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm just about to put my dist. drive shaft back in but decide
&gt; to do some sanity checking first:
&gt; 
&gt; bentley and muir say:  the slot in the dizzy drive shaft should be
&gt; perpendicular to the seam in the case.
&gt; 
&gt; looking at my vacuum advance dizzy and dizzy driveshaft, I note
&gt; that if i install the dizzy with the slot perp. to the seam in the
&gt; case, my rotor will fire like this:
&gt; 
&gt;  3    ______     1
&gt;      /       \
&gt;     | 2     1 |
&gt;     | 3     4 |
&gt;      \_______/
&gt;  4               2
&gt; 
&gt; this is how it had been firing and why, compared to the &quot;normal config&quot;
&gt; listed above, coupled with the fact that my engine was running 1 cylinder
&gt; ahead/behind of itself, I thought my dizzy drive shaft had gotten flipped.
&gt; 
&gt; but now i note that it had been installed to spec:  what gives?
&gt; 
&gt; I had assumed:  perhaps very incorrectly, that the drive shaft had slipped
&gt; over a notch.  If not, did i just do my valves wrong and had the timing
&gt; seriously off, or...?
&gt; 
&gt; man, am i confused...
