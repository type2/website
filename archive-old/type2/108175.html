Subject: Help with FI

Hello All,
Looking for help on my FI 82 vanagon, #3 and 4 injectors are not firing.  I
have tested the electrical connection and both leads coming from ecu are
&quot;hot&quot;.  I think one lead should be hot and one not so it can be grounded when
the injector is supposed to fire. is this correct?  Are'nt all the injectors
supposed to fire at once, if injectors at #1 and 2 are working should'nt the
others be getting the same signal, my first thought is a crossed wire or
something, but on initial inspection nothing is evident.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Sean
