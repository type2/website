Subject: Valve sounds/dinged adjustment screw

Well, I was having some not-normal valve rattle - different from a
slushy lifter.  So, I tore off the 1-2 valve cover.  It seemed the valve
nearest the rear on #2 had a different angle than the others, so I
removed the adjustment screw, and sure enough it's dinged...

I removed the rockers on #2 and the ends of the pushrods on both ends
are fine, the ends of the valves look fine, as do what I can see of the
tops of the lifters down the tube...

Pulled the #2 plug and it looks fine...  Almost too perfect new:

I'm gonna get my roomie to rotate the engine later so I can watch what
that valve does...

Any clues?  Valve stuck shut, so when the pushrod comes up the adjuster
is slamming into it?

Is that the exhaust or intake?  I can never remember - exhaust in the
middle?

Thanks,

Teri
