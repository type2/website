Yep... like Joel says &quot;its rolling north&quot;!  I'll make it short since I just 
spent 12 hours behind the wheel and my wife just handed me an ice cold 
Heineken!

Successful journey!  I still have that high idle when warm problem.  Idles 
normal when I crimp the decel valve hose.  anyone have a used but good one 
they could part with for a 79 FI 2.0?

the lube oil temp gods were smiling on me.... nice and cool all day! ;)
