&gt; Am I missing something...why does it seem that nearly everyone has access to 
&gt; a VW junkyard, but me. Anyone know of one in the Washington, DC area. My 
&gt; brother works at the area largest junk yard, and he seems to be clueless of 
&gt; one either.

there is a German only junkyard in the Gathersburg area, but I haven't
been there in years so I can't remember the directions.

there is also a &quot;private&quot; VW junkyard in Elkridge that is open by
appointment only, but if you can't find it there, quit.  I even saw a type
3 Karman Ghia there!  contact me off list for the guys e-mail if you are
interested.

there are a few other smaller places, a repair shop on Fort Smallwood
road has a &quot;junkyard&quot; behind his shop (for parts ??) I wouldn't let him
touch my van but he is a source of parts. 

and just over the bay bridge on the Eastern shore is a guy who works like
a parts shop, he won't let you in his yard but if you call and tell him
what you want he will pull it and charge you a fortune for it, my source
of last resort.
