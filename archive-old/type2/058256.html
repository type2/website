Subject: Compression opinion?

My 81's auto trans developed an ebola virus and began &quot;bleeding out&quot; over the
past couple of weeks to the tune of about a pint every 100 miles. Realizing a
new torque converter seal is in order but feeling lazy I thought I'd have Jim
Ellis VW here in Atlanta do the job along with any other gaskets etc. When I
called I asked for a guesstimate to avoid any surprises since I had in mind
somewhere between $250 and $300 as my limit. 

Wow! The guesstimate was $1100 which included a $288 parts kit and 15 hours
labor. The gist of it was that they felt if the trans was coming out it ought
to have the &quot;clutch packs&quot; renewed and they didn't offer to back off of that
idea. Well, it's suddenly nice and cool here so maybe rolling around on the
ground isn't so bad. Ron Salmon's got $22 worth of seal and gaskets on the way
and I started last night disconnecting everything to drop the motor. I figure
to do the trans seal while in place and then the pan gasket etc.

Now the real question. Before disconnecting, I tested my compression because I
had had my eye on #3 for several months since it had last tested at 90. The
current results were with 6 cranks each: #1 100, #2 110, #3 90, #4 110. This
engine has maybe 125m with 20m on heads and p&amp;c's and compression was
generally 115-120 when first renewed. Certainly it's fairly balanced and
Bentley sez 90 is within limits but that 87 is the minimum. Should I do
anything with the head or rings while I have it on the ground other than just
retorqueing?

As a hint, I found 6 months ago when I popped the valve cover for a look that
the adjusting screw on #3 exhaust was considerably more tightened down than
the others. Looked a bit further and found that the push rod was riding
against the rim of the rocker socket and not in the socket itself and
presumably had been for 15m miles or more. Difference of 1/4&quot; or more?
Probably a real testiment to the value of hydraulic lifters but I would guess
that there had to be some ill effect. I don't seem to burn oil and putting a
little oil in the cylinder lifts compression only 5lbs or so. I'm thinking the
valve may be the problem and it might be worth pulling the head to be
examined. Sound reasonable?
