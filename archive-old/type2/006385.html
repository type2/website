If this is the case, why does a flame light a charge much easier than a
spark? Flames can easily light A/F ratios of 23:1, and a spark can't do
that. This is how some Honda engines worked, with 2 combustion chambers, one
at 14:1 (for spark ignition), and the other at 22:1 which was ignited by the
already burning 14:1 chamber. (for example).

The point I was making is that many people think they know why, but even the
pros are sure EXACTLY how a spark ignites the charge.
