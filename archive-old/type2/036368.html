Subject: Artist Wanted for BD Catalog

Any artists out there?

I need a person or people to design both a Bus Depot logo, and complete
front cover art for an upcoming Bus Depot catalog.

I have some ideas which I'd share with interested parties.  The logo would
be the domain of a good graphic artist perhaps, but the cover (as I
visualize it at this point) is pretty complicated and would require some
real illustrative art skills.   I thought of contacting the local art
colleges (Philly has several) looking for students who would be interested,
but it occurred to me that there may be some budding artists on the lists as
well.

My initial thoughts are to trade for product (although cash is not out of
the question).  Maybe $100 in product in exchange for a logo that I use, and
$500 in product for a front cover?  I don't know if this is reasonable or
not, but if you are interested maybe you can tell me.  You would also get to
see your work reproduced on thousands of catalogs and the website.

If you are someone, or know someone, who would be interested, please p-mail
me.
