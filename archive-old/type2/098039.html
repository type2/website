Subject: Rear shocks.

Hi folks,

Just looking for a second opinion here before I start 
taking stuff apart.  Been getting a banging sound coming 
from the right rear of the camper ever since I brought 
Kermit home.  Only happens when hitting a good bump in 
the road.  Thought it was something loose banging around 
in back but on the way home from the airport last night, 
I had my girlfriend drive while I sat in the back seat 
and took a good listen.  Definately coming from the 
right rear wheel well.  Upon getting home, there is a 
slightly noticable list to the right.  Also, much more 
play on the right than the left when rocking the camper 
from side to side.

My diagnosis....right rear shock.  Anything else it 
could be that I'm not thinking about?

Thanks,

Duke
