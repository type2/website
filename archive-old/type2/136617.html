Subject: Re: [T2] clutch scrape?

Assuming you're right, this should resolve it then?

So much for noise reduction this month :( On the upside, I'll get to do
my first engine pull. Considering that the removal of noise absorbing
shtuff brought this out, I think its safe to assume that this has been
a growing condition and needs to be addressed post-haste.
Thanks for your insight. I expect I'll be asking questions as I pull
this engine out and get into this a bit.

Richard Atwell &lt;ratwell_at_mac_dot_com&gt; replied:
My guess is that the clutch disc, if old enough, has worn to the point
that the rivets holding the two halves together are scraping against
the flywheel and/or pressure plate.

I said:
Instead, there's kind of a metalic scraping sound when I clutch. I
don't know how to better describe it, but it doesn't sound like a good
thing - like _lots_ of ball bearings rolling on a metal sheet.
