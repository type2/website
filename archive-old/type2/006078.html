Any decent marine supply should have these fittings in stock, in a choice of
brass/bronze or stainless steel.

Bring lots of money.....

&gt;&gt;  Has anyone found stainless steel replacement for the luggage tie
downs on the surrond the luggage rack? I have a really cool vinyl
cover that appears to be made from the same material as the side tent
floor. The cover has leather straps that slip into the tie downs. I
would like to use this but I do not trust the rusty nasty tie downs.  &lt;&lt;
