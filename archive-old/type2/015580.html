Before you install the motor, you should be able to turn the motor by hand
with the flywheel or a ratchet and socket assist. If you can't, send it
back to the rebuilder. If it turned by hand ok before you put it in, but
after installing it was hard to turn, you have an installation prob.
Flywheel binding or something. With the plugs out, installed, you should
still be able to turn the motor with a wrench on the alt/gen nut and
pressing on the fan belt. If you can't, you should pull the motor. If it
turns then, you have an install prob. If it doesn't, back to the rebuilder,
it's not right. Do verify the crankshaft endplay. You can do that when
installed at the fan with a dial guage. Push the fan in and out by hand. A
sleight play should be there. A clunk-clunk is too much. 
The only way to know for sure is to measure it with a guage.

Do that before you try push starting. 

It could well be the starter motors. If they are old as the hills, a new
starter may be ok. If a new starter, or best, a Bosch Corp. reman, has any
trouble turning the motor at reasonable starting speed with a good battery,
you have to pull that motor and verify the problem.

Do contact the rebuilder before you do anything and explain what's
happening. They can advise where your problem may be. Ask them what prelube
they use for assembly. It could be that the clearances are ok just they
used STP of some other high viscosity lube which might exlain things. I
won't accept a motor if I can't grap the flywheel and turn it. A new motor
should be turnable by hand, period.....
