The clearance is tight, but there may be some covers that are made
specifically for use with the bar.

You might also be able to mod the bar to clear the fittings, but remember
to strengthen the back side before you cut away at the pump side!

&gt; List,
&gt; 
&gt; While gathering info for this 71 bus engine, i have learned that there may be
&gt; beetle cases that can be drilled and tapped for the rear bar.
&gt; This is cool.
&gt; 
&gt; I have also learned tentatively that i may not be able to run the full-flow
&gt; oil pump cover because it won't clear the rear bar.
&gt; Any thoughts?
