All this talk about toxic solvents and such.  The scout knife worked fine
for me.  And piston #2 had it caked on!  Also, I wonder why so many seem so
anxious to buy new pistons and cylinders.  Unless worn out of specification
or pitted to the whazoo I think people just like going to the FLAPS and
asking for &quot;new P&amp;C's&quot; just to look cool.  I don't know.
