&gt; Hi guys.  I am still wondering about the sender unit
&gt; in the tank.  Or is it by the tank?  What's the

no the 73-79 senders are in the tank

&gt; inherent problem with these?  It's obviously sending
&gt; something for it to read half-full.  But this is a
&gt; common problem.  One guy here said that he changed the
&gt; wire and it fixed it.  I'm just wondering what the
&gt; underlying problem is.  I may or may not change mine.

well they work by sensing the ohmage (or is it voltage) in any case there
is a winding on the sender and a wiper that slides over this as a float
goes up and down..   the windings will wear and start sending the wrong
reading... if it hasn't been changed and is original then it is at least
25 years old, a lot of up and down for the slider to wear thru.

I have a 78 with fuel injection, don't need to remove engine and my hands
are fairly small so it is a real contortion but I have changed it out and
will likely do it again soon as my guage shows 3/4 when full but gets more
accurate as it goes down with 0 being empty. probably can live with it for
a while but rarely let the tank get below 1/3 or so.

&gt; Might wait until I have to have the engine dropped for
&gt; something else. But if the price is right I'll go
&gt; ahead and buy one of those in advance.  I wonder if I
&gt; really need one.  Thanks...KR

might be the best choice

Bob
