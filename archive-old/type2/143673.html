Subject: Re: [T2] Sourcing Oil Filters in a pinch

FWIW, I think Schucks is pretty useless.  One time, right after I bought my
Bus, I wandered into a Schucks to buy a set of feeler gauges.  Not only did
they not carry them, but NO ONE who was working there had ever even heard of a
feeler gauge.  Really.  I'm dead serious about this.

In Seattle, as the general-purpose FLAPS go, I really like the NAPA in Lake
City.  The people who work there actually know some things about cars,
including old ones, and they're always very helpful.

And then of course there's Bow Wow (VWFLAPS), which absolutely, positively,
without a doubt carries the correct filter in stock.  Still, the Fred Meyer
tip is very helpful, esp. since they're open until 11pm!

Cheers,

- Miles
