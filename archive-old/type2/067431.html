Subject: First engine pull

Well, here I am on the eve of my first engine pull.  I have a '74 bus
and am going to attempt a clutch replacement.
But. . .HELP!!!

In the Muir book, he suggests that you support your transmission with
a 2 X 4 and a couple of chains.  The bentley says to use a VW support
brace.  The Wilson book says to use a jack. (I ordered all these books
specifically for this engine removal !)

Nevertheless, in the Changes and New Ideas chapter of the 25th anniv.
ed. of the Muir, a person suggests that no brace is needed to support
the transmission when pulling the engine.  Is this a possibility?  I
would rather not have to go buy some chain and lumber and take this
persons advice, but I would hate to harm my poor bus in any way.

Suggestions?. . . .  Peter Hanowell
