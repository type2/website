Subject: Ethics of selling VIN plates?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com, type2_at_type2_dot_com

Recently at shows and on the 'net, I've run across a few VW folks
selling VIN plates, cut-out stamped serial numbers, and titles removed
from (presumably) wrecked or rusted-out buses.

I've also read posts from people who have had their buses stolen,
which is obviously a traumatic experience.  I don't think that anyone
wants to see their pride and joy disappear!

It seems to me that the only reason someone would buy a VIN plate is
to make legal a bus to which they have no legal title.  While there
may be legitimate reasons for this, it seems far more likely that the
VIN would be fraudulently applied to a bus acquired by theft.

Every state (and presumably country) has procedures in place to clear
the title for a vehicle that you possess legally.  There is no reason
that I can think of to swap VIN plates unless the ownership of the
vehicle is questionable.

With the theft problem that we have, should we condone a practice that
is likely to result in more buses being stolen?
