Subject: re: [T2] tools needed in NC

&gt;&gt;Also, if anyone has a compression gauge, or whatever
 it is that I need to check for vacuum leaks&lt;&lt;

Kyle,

i'm in your area but don't have any of the tools you mention.

however, have you tried hunting for vacuum leaks using the
aerosol can method?

that might help if you don't have a compression tester.

HTH,

p.s. - &amp; yes, there are plenty of busses in our area but whenever
i meet a new bus driver they've never heard of type2_dot_com, so i
always try to spread the knowledge.
