Subject: Re: WR1 Relay Kit

Just this evening I installed a WR1 kit.  I bought it from Bus Depot three
years ago for my other bus, but I never got around to installing it before
I sold the engine out of it.

The kit took me only about an hour to install in the dark.  It wasn't all
that hard, the hardest being drilling the holes for the ground and the
relay.  There isn't much space near the starter!  I installed mine to a
cross piece, the same one that had the heater cable stop on it.

I didn't have a hot start problem as much as a slow start problem.  If it
didn't get at the first hit, then the next hit would be real slow until it
fired. I likly will need a solenoid or strater soon, I imagine.

Regards,
