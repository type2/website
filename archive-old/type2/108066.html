Subject: Re: [T2] 72 Westy Fuel Pump Rod problems

Tom-
I had to gently tap the rod in with a hammer
But had to use Vice grips to pull it back out

Remember this is a 72 with the fuel pump under the motor ahead of the #1
cylinder
It goes in and out, not up and down.
But the more I think about it, it doesn't move smoothly at all.
I'll see if I can't clean out the hole a bit and perhaps turn the rod down a
couple of thousands.

with the hose off, not a drop of gas at all.

Thanks for the reply

Thanks !

&gt; How hard is it to wiggle the rod up and down with a light touch with
forceps
&gt; or needle nose pliers? Tom
&gt;
&gt; Try taking the fuel hose off the carb, hold it over a bottle and get
&gt; somebody to crank the starter over. Fuel should gush out, if not you go
from
&gt; there. Tom

&gt;
&gt; As I mentioned before-
&gt; Newer fuel pump, brand new motor, but no gas
&gt;
&gt; I pulled the rod out and checked the length (137mm)
&gt; Then last night while watching the Mighty Ducks I had a brain cloud
&gt; &quot;what if the rod is fitting in the block too tight and does not return to
&gt; follow the lobe on the cam?&quot;
&gt; In effect it would pump just one stroke and stop, being extend all the way
&gt; out.
&gt;
&gt; So the question to the list is...
&gt; How tight is your rod?
&gt; or better yet, how tight should it be?
