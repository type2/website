Subject: Removing expandable foam
Date: Mon, 1 Mar 1999 09:50:28 -0500 

Here's a question that I didn't find answered in the type2 archive: my '71
kamper had some rusty body cavities filled by the PO with expanding foam -
rather than allow the foam to continue to trap moisture (aggravating the
rust problem - duh), I began to dig it out...laboriously.  I remember once
reading somewhere about a common product (brake cleaner?) that would help
dissolve such foam, facilitating removal - anyone out there with
suggestions?  Tx,

O. Grant
