Subject: Anyone want a Calif. '77 Bus??

I was on a job a couple weeks ago, and there was this
bus sitting out front. I noticed it wasn't registered
so I decided to place a 'do you want to sell this bus'
note on the windshield..

Well i got a call today from the owner, he does have
it registered until july '04 just never put the tags
on it..

this is a deluxe i believe, with the sliding sun roof,
has good tires, decently staight body, nice interior,
everything appears to be there, has a fold out bed
type seat in rear.. He was told the motor needs major
work, rebuilt..

He told me he would take a couple hundred, i
reiterated $200, he agreed..

my better half and myself have made a deal quite some
time back, where my german addiction only allows me 2
cars at a time, so i must pass this up :0(..

if you are interested let me know and I'll get you the
guys #...

its in Riverside, CA  92501

peace,
rob
