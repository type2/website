&gt; Sooo, it _is_ possible to use the stock alternator to support two batteries?
&gt; How does one &quot;optimize&quot; an alternator?
&gt; 
&gt; I've been looking at upgrading to two batteries from the get-go here, and
&gt; wasn't quite sure where to start.

I have twin 950AH batteries in mine wired in parallel, 8ga wire connecting
them, one on each side in the rear...they are both charged evenly by the
alt, however I have only been able to get em to work right if both are
identical and bought at the same time, otherwise one drains the other?

YMMV
