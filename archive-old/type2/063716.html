&gt; The first time I saw (my cousin the cop) right after (a Dead show), I
&gt; showed him a sticker with a yellow GD bear surrounded by red roses. &quot;What
&gt; does this mean to you?&quot; I asked. &quot;Stop the vehicle &amp; search for drugs!&quot; 
...
&gt; It's too bad that I have to be afraid to display a bear sticker on my
&gt; camper because of police attitudes....

Hey now

The PO of my '77 Westy is a Marine.  I have a set of stickers on my
bus that hold me harmless - Semper Fi, and the complete encoding of
the PO's rank and division (if that's the right term - apologies to
any Marines out there).

Never been stopped...
