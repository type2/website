&gt;Question:  Is it possible for a dizzy to be put in incorrectly? As in the
&gt;mark that should point to cylnder 1 being TDC is actually pointing to
&gt;cylnder 3 being TDC?

No and Yes. No, the dizzy can only go into engine (engage the distributor drive
gear)
one way. But Yes, the distributor drive gear can be reversed or misaligned,
causing the distributor to engage only in a reversed or strange direction,
resulting in the condition you describe.

Oftentimes the valve setter ends up trying to set the valves for #1 when the
engine is at
TDC for #3 in these instances.

This is why you cannot simply assume that once the rotor points to the notch on
the
distributor and the TDC mark on the pulley is in the ballpark, that the engine
is at TDC and ready for valve adjustment. You must confirm that you are at TDC
for #1 by viewing the movement of the #3 intake and exhaust valves as you
slowing spin the motor, OR using the method or removing the plugs and feeling
the piston movement with a wire while you slowly spin the motor, in order to
confirm 100% that you are at TDC for #1 or for any set of valves for which you
are about to set.

Incidently this mispositioning of the distributor drive gear and subsequent
weird positioning of the distributor/notch will not prevent you from proceeding
and setting the
valves, you will just have an unusual arrangement which can be tuned just as
effectively,
but it will be misleading to you and others the next time the valves need to be
adjusted.
the ultimate solution to this is removing and reinstalling the distributor drive
gear properly so that the pulley notch, distributor notch, rotor direction and
confirmation of
valve movement with the naked eye are all in alignment.

Consult the firm of Wilson, Muir, Bentley and Haynes for further instruction.
