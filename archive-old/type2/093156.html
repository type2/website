Subject: Re: [T2] How to wire stove for 1978 Westy ?

The stove requires no power, you're probably seeing the sink faucet pump 
wiring.


&gt;I have a 1978 Westy deluxe that was missing the sink / stove cabinet
&gt;when I purchased it. I found a new cabinet in good shape and want to
&gt;install it. I see a long red wire with a push on connector, and a short brown
&gt;wire with push on connector (I take it to be ground ?).
&gt;
&gt;Just to make it more confusing, the long red wire is connected
&gt;in the middle to a 4-way small square black connector.
&gt;in the bottom is one red wire, other red long wire with push
&gt;on connector out the bottom. Out the top are two 6&quot; black
&gt;wires that today are not connected to anything ??
&gt;
&gt;Can someone advise me on how to wire this up ? Is there
&gt;some documentation on the site I have missed ?
