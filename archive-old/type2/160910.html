Yes, it is threaded. On the inside. Where the plug
that you remove to slip the hose over the outside
goes. Not threaded on the outside unless something
rare and unheard of by most of us! Just a simple hose
&amp; clamp will do it. Be sure to test with the regulator
under high vacuum and low vacuum. Once the gauge is
secure you can start &amp; run the engine. At fast idle,
reading should be 2bar; with vacuum removed from
pressure regulator (pull the vacuum hose loose)
pressure should be 2.5bar. Bar is approx. 14.7 at
sealevel on a nice day. -BaH
 Jon, 
 Thanks for the reply.
 I am almost positive that my test port is threaded. 
 It has been a little while (last Fall), but I've had
 it out before and I remember it being a very small
 threaded plug. I am 99% positive!
 I am meaning the plug on the driver's side fuel rail
 a short distance from the firewall.  I am assuming
 that this is the test port?  Is there another place
 to test the pressure?  Did some have threaded plugs
 and others not?
 What holds the non threaded plug in the rail against
 the fuel pressure?
 Thanks again,
 Greg
