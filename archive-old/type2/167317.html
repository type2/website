&gt; &quot;I'm surprised none of the major oil companies have marketed an oil

&gt; They do! Castrol. I just found a link yesterday for a classic car  
&gt; 20W-50
&gt; Syntec. I have yet to find it in stores, but it is formulated for  
&gt; solid
&gt; lifters, tappets and different flow characteristics shared by  
&gt; classic cars,
&gt; and our VWs. It specifically has a high-zinc formula.

That was fast! I only just started to complain. :-)

Syntec 20w50 used to have the lowest concentration of all Castrol  
oils and now it's done a flip flop. Great!

Google came up with this when I was trying to figure out how to  
distinguish an old bottle from a new one:

&quot;Thank you for contacting Castrol,

The new formula Syntec 20W-50 for clasic cars is actually API SM. The
statement &quot;Recommended for Classic Cars&quot; should be visible in the  
middle of
the back

Note that the Zinc levels (actually the Sulfur and Phosphorus levels) in
the API SM / ILSAC GF-4 viscosity grades are defined by a table of
requirements but in basic terms 20W-50 is not held to the same  
requirements
as the lower viscosity grades (5W-20, 0W-30, 5W-30, 10W-30); 20W-50  
can be
higher.
Current Syntec 20W-50 (for classic cars) is actually a modern premium
quality API SM product that has been Zinc boosted to Zinc levels that  
are
reminiscent of Zinc levels from historic API categories such as SG  
when flat
tappet cams with high spring loads were common in the fleet. For  
reference,
note that the API SM category has the most rigorous passenger car  
engine oil
(PCO) test performance requirements in the history of the API PCO
categories.

The level of Zinc in the new Syntec 20W-50 is a minimum of 1200 ppm,  
which
will provide excellent anti-wear protection for the cam and lifters in a
flat-tappet cam engine.

We estimate that Castrol SYNTEC 20W50 Classic Car formula should be  
widely
available at retail locations by October 2007. We cannot disclose  
exactly
where the product is currently available, although it has been  
ordered by
several key customers. Unfortunately, we can only control when we  
ship the
product, not when our customers' inventory allows it to make its way  
to the
shelf.
