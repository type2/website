Mike,

Thanks for your input.

Yes it does... and I agree about it being the old sink power line and also
agree that I'd that it's better to get power from the fridge circuit.

 &gt; 1) My big red wire is no longer connected to the fuse panel; it is 
stuffed


Does that red wire have a black cover over it?  That might be the old 
power line to the sink.  That's what I have in my 78.


&gt; 3) They've tapped into the fridge power wire (between the battery/city
&gt; switch and the fridge power switch) - so that the sink now gets its power
&gt; from the aux battery or city power.

probably better anyways.

later,
MIke
