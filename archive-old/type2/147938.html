Subject: Re: Progressive vacuum advance problem?

 &gt;I've had my new SVDA for a week, and I don't seem to be
getting ANY vacuum advance, although the bus seems
to appreciate the new points, cap &amp; rotor.
It doesn't seem to matter if I connect the hose or not,
although sucking on the distributor seemed to make all
the right things happen.

 From your description the most likely explanation is an obstruction in the 
passage through to the venturi. Unless your progressive is constructed 
differently to mine, there is no way to disassemble this area. You will 
need to blow, soak or poke out the obstruction. You need to consider that 
the hole is smaller at the venturi end so you may jam the obstruction in 
harder by blowing from the outside!

If it's some consolation, I ran a progressive with a stock distributor on a 
2l engine and the vacuum advance worked perfectly.

Good luck!

Martin.
