Next time reply with, &quot;can you drive almost anywhere and sleep 4, cook, eat, 
and fridgerate your food any time you wish?&quot;. The Westy is a unique vehicle. 
In my recolection there is no other stock factory vehicle like it!

&gt;He says, &quot;Oh God, you mean it woud be like your old heap? F*ck that! Your
&gt;van is always needing one thing or another.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Why do we love our vans so much even though they require so much work and 
&gt;go
&gt;so slow?
&gt;
&gt;What would you have said if you were in my shoes?
