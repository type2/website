That's what I experience.

&gt; and usually find my shifting
&gt; comfort between 3000 and 4000rpm. 3000 on the flats, and 4000 to  
&gt; really get
&gt; some steam up for a hill.Does that roughly coincide with anyone  
&gt; using a tach ?

I do the same also.

&gt; It sounds like above 4000 is really over revving.

The factory rev limiter was set for 5400rpm but I find that anything  
over 4000rpm sounds like you are really winding up and over-revving  
the motor.
