Next 40 years?
Glen, don' t punish yourself as I did.
I bought my 58 split back in early 1978. I repaired it, camperised it and
drove it regulary (March to Oktober, we have heavy salted roads
in the wintertime) for about 15 years. We've seen a lot of europe in it.
I bought heaps of used and new spare parts, broke three splits for parts,
did the same for a 412 - and had to move with all the parts three times over
the last 21 years.  The second time I had to rent a big VW LT for the part
movement. My personal things could be moved in the split...

Before I had to do the last movement (yet), I decided to keep only the best
and rarest parts, because there are so many aftermarket
and repros available nowadays as have not been back in '78. And I was tired
to carry all the stuff again and again. The rent for the stock is also not
neglectible.

And I had to understand, that, if I'd use the bus as a daily driver, I can't
keep it in a really good condition (it's not dry California here).

I have changed within that time. Different interests with 42 than with 21.
Sad, but true, not every free hour must be for the split.
But it's too late to give it away now. Too many journeys, too many hours
under it, too many stories. If the big boss gives his ok, it will stay
another 19 years with me. But only as a beloved split for eventual dry
summer events use, not as my camper. Sometimes a money-eating load. Only
sometimes.

I love the '77 westy for the fun, it gives me traveling in it now. It' more
than regulary serviced and taken care for it , also only taken out for the
weekends and long distance trips. But I haven't started to fill up the new
workshop with Bay/Loaf stuff. Those things, I really need are
bought, when I need them (or will need them soon).
If all that Bay-stuff will be that rare, I'll get a problem. Then.

But maybe we all prefer the natural-gas powered 2010 Eurovans that days.

58 and 77 were good years, weren't they?

Best wishes,
Michael

58 split
77 westy
74 412 auto
84 bmw 316 auto - the only car that really makes sense - daily used, no
worries about dents. Watercooled. Not worth to collect  :))
