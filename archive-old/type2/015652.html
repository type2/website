Subject: Re: Vent on late model Double Cabs

Neale,

Congratulations on your purchase! '79 DCs are rare,even in Oz...
The vent you describe is the air intake for the engine,and on carb
models at least,connects directly to the air filter-if everything is 
still in tact.It is NOT cabin ventillation.

Air comes in thru the vents and travels downwards in a double skin panel
below.It comes out briefly into the cabin space behind the rear seat
-you will see a plastic elbow on the RHS just above the tool compartment
behind the rear seat.(Most people wonder WTF that is...)
From there the air supply turns rear ward and travels towards the
engine compartment thru a hollow rectangular steel channel that supports
the load tray above.
In the engine bay (just above the battery) you will see a flexable tube
approx 60mm dia connected to the channel section and this takes the air to
the air filter.If the tube is missing,obviously you'll see the hole where
the tube should be ;) 
In a van this tube sticks up in to the rear air intakes above but in a DC,
it's a bit more interesting...
So in a way,it's a kind of snorkel.Wankers in 4WDs spend big money to have
them fitted (when they rarely go off road anyway) but your DC came with one
as standard equipment :)

BTW,if you need any parts for you DC project,contact me.A mate of
mine is winding up his VW business and has quite a lot a DC parts
amongst his stash over the years.I'm helping him sort it out and
catalogue it all for sale,so lemme know if there's anything you're
missing.I might be able to help you out.

Cheers,

&gt;
&gt;I just bought up a rusty, but complete, 1979 RHD Double Cab (Model 268) to
&gt;do up as my regular transport &amp; toy.
&gt;
&gt;It will be necessary to cannibalize the 1975 RHD Double Cab for the gates,
&gt;rear door, engine hatch, rear seat pedestal etc, plus a few body panels, but
&gt;it should be a MUCH easier job to make a goer out of the '79 (luckily).
&gt;
&gt;There was one significant difference between the '79, and any other DC I've
&gt;ever seen, and I was wondering whether anyone could help me out with it? On
&gt;the rear driver's side (Right) corner of the cab, there is a vertical line
&gt;of louvers above the window line, they're about 1 1/2&quot; wide, and the line is
&gt;about a foot high. Does anyone know whether this is cabin ventilation (my
&gt;friend's belief ), or something to do with the induction system?
&gt;
&gt;I can probably trace it when I pick it up next week, but if anyone could
&gt;provide a definitive answer on what it's for, it'd be appreciated.
&gt;
&gt;Thanking you in anticipation.
&gt;
&gt;Regards,
&gt;
&gt;Neale
&gt;
&gt;NB: Can't really complain on the DC front, I've picked up two for $1000 AUD
&gt;( rusty 1975 shell with reasonable gates, good rear door, pedestal etc for
&gt;$400, and rusty, complete 1979 DC with the 2L engine, 091 tranny, good
&gt;seats, all electrics etc for $600 ), AND my ex, and her sister are letting
&gt;me store both at their place for a couple of months until my house is built.
&gt;Given the deplorable events in the world at the moment, something like this
&gt;has to be classed as a GOOD thing, in my book.
