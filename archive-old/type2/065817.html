Subject: Ideal Upright Engine Puller...

Okay, go up to the Wal-Mart and hike to the automotive department. See if
they have a big mountain of somethings called &quot;MVP SuperLift.&quot; I don't know
whether all the stores carry the same thing but I bet they do. Run you
$19.95.

This is just like a hydraulic floor jack, but in miniature. It's about 18
inches long. Four casters. Rated 2000 lb capacity, it says, so don't go
jacking your bus up with this and crawling underneath. But it seems to me
to be the perfect aircooled engine puller. Haven't tried it yet. The
jack-point thing, the cup-shaped deal that touches the bus, is detachable
with a little cotter pin, which means it will be simple to make an
eight-inch square platform out of thick plywood that will pin to the jack
and will be secure and stay square.

Seems to weigh about 25 lbs, so you can carry it in the bus easily--let's
make that next roadside rebuild a low-effort proposition, people! ;)
