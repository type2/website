&gt; My '71 intermittently sputters and dies (as if it were running out

&gt; or week later. New points, plugs, condenser, coil and a cleaned

So if it dies out usually only with a large fuel load I would suggest
changing the fuel filter, it's sure a cheap fix if it is infact the
problem. If that doesn't work, look into what pressure the fuel pump
is pumping, it might be going out &amp; only doing part of it's job.
