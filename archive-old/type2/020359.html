&gt; Gentlepersons-
&gt;                        You guys out there got all the luck...Anybody know of
&gt; a Van-related recycler (even a junkyard'll do), in the Northern NJ area?
&gt; Anything close
&gt; enough to pop over to without turning into a road trip? Two of the local yards
&gt; in my area
&gt; were EPA'd out of existence

And just check those geographically close to you and keep enlarging your search
radius until you locate on.
