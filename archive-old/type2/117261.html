&gt; Has anyone done the yen to US dollar conversion to see how much these

One of the pages showed some prices of the &quot;&quot; vehicles.

The 1995 model shown is 880000Y, about 7600 USD.
One of the 1997 models is 1250000Y, about 11000 USD.

Of course, it would cost a lot more then that if you bought one, shipped
it over, and tried to get it past customs.  Unless, perhaps, you're a
diplomat from a country where these are street legal...:)
