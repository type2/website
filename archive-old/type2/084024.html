Subject: Re: [T2] repair reservoir

I have glued over cracks before-
The key feature to gluing over cracks in plastic is to really rough up
the surface so it will grip the glue.  Using a razor, I score it with
many parallel lines; sanding it also roughs it.
When I cracked my pool intake leaf strainer (off above ground pool) I
roughed up the surface around the crack and then encased it in silicone
calk.  Try E6000 urethane glue/calk; this is very tough but has a bit of
elasticity that should allow it not to crack from the plastic like epoxy
might.
