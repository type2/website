Subject: RE: RE: [T2] driving w/o windshield [was: replacing windshield
 andrubber together?]

OK folks, as we know there are 50 states, each of which has different
laws.  Some states require a windshield, some do not.  some require
windshield wipers only if a windshield is installed, so po' folks remove
the windshield to avoid fixing the windshield wipers.  Other states have
summary execution for driving a dirty car.  Such is life.

Let's let this thread die a peaceful death.
