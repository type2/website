Subject: Vanagon ignition question
Mime-Version: 1.0

Another Vanagon question (can you tell the weather was nice here??)

The Vanagon is stumbling and missing under load, but it idles nicely and
has pickup until about 2600 RPM. If this was a *real* van (like my '71)
I would suspect points or condenser. But, the Vanagon has a Hall
distributor. Plugs, wires, cap and rotor all look OK, clean under the cap,
rotor checks out on the multimeter. Coil checks out but is marginal.
Would a bad coil cause this kind of stumble? Can I use a regular 12 Volt
coil to test it, or must I use a special coil for the Hall distributor?

(It has carbs, so don't suspect the FI.)

Thanks a bunch. (Man, I love it when Summer is just around the corner. I was
so tired of being cold all the time...)
