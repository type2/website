All specifications, EVERYTHING,  can be tweaked or adjusted to whatever. All
gaps and all settings. The mfgs. are doing it constantly to manipulate the
emissions readings and factory specs are not necessarily prescribed for the
best power or economy results.

Hi-performance mags are a great source for reading and learning about this
logic.

&gt; &gt; So you are saying we can use a wider plug gap and get a better burn
&gt; &gt; if
&gt; &gt; we use one of those high output coils?
&gt;
&gt; Yes, but the points and condenser will have to handle the increased
&gt; current flow to the coil.  Nothing comes for free! :)
