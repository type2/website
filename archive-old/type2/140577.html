Subject: CHT Failure

My VDO CHT appears to be failing at hightway speeds - a few days ago I watched
the needle go up and down as I was traveling along _at_60mph  - In the city it
seems to be working fine but as I accelorate past 40mph it goes on and off
line again - off the highway and into town it returns to normal almost
instantly

any thoughts before I crawl under and pull all the wiring off - would it act
this way if there is some exposed wire touching some metal ?

Eric
