Subject: 1200 Bosch Germany Cap and Rotor Kit

Dear Volks,

I searched the vintage bus archives but couldn't find out much, so 
apologies if this is an off-topic question, but many of you volks have 
splitties as well as bays, so here goes.

Before it started raining I was out in my bus (1969, recently revived 
after a long few years of sitting) sorting through the plethora of spare 
parts I've accumulated over the years-- trying to get back to my 
emergency road kit essentials-- and I found a Bosch Germany Cap and 
Rotor kit in its original packaging (Exp. No. 06001/Part No. CR1) for 
Beetle 1200 years 61-61, 62-64, Ghia 1200 years 61-61, 62-64, and 
Transporter 1200 60-61, 62-64.  

I recall a thread about someone looking for original German rotor/cap, 
though this is not the right year for that listee, just how rare are 
these? If I wanted to trade or sell what might be a fair asking price?

Thanks,
Karen
