Subject: Re: [T2] Why retrofit a smaller oil pump in a dual port ? (aka
  PO rant)

Karl,
I am glad you are onboard this thread. After my research I think that
not all 1971's came with dished camshaft gear.

I believe &quot;early 1971&quot; came with dual port and flat cam and 21mm oil
pump. While &quot;late 1971&quot; (starting in May 1971 - Bentley chapter 5,
section 17) came with dished 4-rivet cam and 26mm oil pump. This
matches with the Bentley but Wilson got it wrong. My 1971 is an
early-1971, manufactured in 09/1970.

My wild guess is that VW discovered in May 1971 that the dual port
engine with its larger carb and doghouse oil cooler could also use a
larger capacity oil pump. So the &quot;late-1971&quot; got the 26mm oil pump and
that is the last upgrade that would go in the early baywindow.

- Arnaud
not all 1971 busses made equal.
my 1971 to get an upgraded oil pump.


&gt; The 1971 bus dual port engine should have a dished
&gt; gear.
&gt; The 1970 and back single port should have a flat face
&gt; gear.
