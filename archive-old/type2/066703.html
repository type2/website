Don't reply to me!!!

for S &amp; R:  

&gt; I have an old friend from my hippy traveling days. For years I have
&gt; promised to restore it to old beauty and grace.  But the years have past
&gt; quicker than you can imagine.  Now I don't have the energy to do it right
&gt; for at 64, I am aged as the old camper.  
&gt; 
&gt; So I want to sale it to someone who will realize its great beauty and fix
&gt; it up.
