Bill,

I think the real point of contention is the provisions in the law that
encourages private corporations to solicite 'voluntary' scraping of vehicles,
allowing them to sell or trade the 'pollution credits' earned as a result.  

Have you given any thought as to who they are going to sell such 'credits'
to?

It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that this law is written
specifically for major industrial pollutors, providing them a mile-wide
loophole.  And I can imagine what the mailings from those private
corporations are going to look like -- so close to official documents the
average person, who will never bother to wade through the 8,000+ words of
legaleese bullshit making up the new law -- will never know the difference.

Did you notice ultra-cute provisions for the different ways of scraping a
vehicle?  How some can actually end up back on the roads whereas others,
including their grossly polluting engines, can only be sold as parts?  Having
earned X-bucks for selling these phony 'pollution credits', how much do you
think they are going to make chop-shopping your crew-cab?

With that as prolog, have you any doubt as to which group of vehicles those
corporations are going to go after?  Let me give you a hint:  The older the
vehicle, the bigger the 'pollution credit'.

See that light at the end of the tunnel?  It's a train, Bill.
