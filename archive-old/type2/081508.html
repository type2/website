Subject: Re: [T2] engine removal/supporting tranny



&gt; I think you can safely skip that one.
&gt; The front mount is pretty heavy duty as well.  I've pulled a few and never
&gt; had a need to support the tranny, front or rear.
&gt;
&gt; Then again, maybe I just learned something.  Karl or Tim, got any advice for
&gt; us on this one? :-)

I never support it. I do remove the 2 upper rear bolts. The trans drops down
about 4&quot; when I slide the engine out. The axles hold it up. The front mount
will pivot. The shift coupler will pivot as long as it is in neutral.
I remove my 77 2.0L by myself in 35 minutes. Piece of cake. Takes a little
over an hour putting it back in and driving away.
