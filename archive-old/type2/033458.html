Volks,

  I entered mexico at El Paso 2 years ago and drove to Manzanillo and I must 
say it was an interesting trip. We traveled as they say daylight only and it 
took 3 days. All we had to pay was something like $60-120  and that allowed 
me to be in Mexico for 6 months. I ended up leaving it in Manzanillo and 
obtained what is called an FM-3 which allows an american to have a car in 
mexico for an indefinite time.
 For whatever its worth, my 2 cents.

  Regards,
   David
