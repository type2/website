Subject: RE: [T2] 73?

It's also possible that, if the van sustained some front sheet metal damage,
the sheet metal may have been replaced. Generally speaking the later sheet
metal was all that was available.
Are your turn signals up by the vent or down by the bumper? Lower turn
signals were the norm thru '72. Another item that was changed was the
bumper, and the step into the door. '73-up had a &quot;5 m.p.h.&quot; bumper, and the
step was integrated into the door sill. '72's had a normal bolt on bumper
which wrapped around to the door and provided a step up into the van. Much
more attractive, IMHO. Important differences are everywhere on the van, like
engine size, smog pump, brake calipers and booster, etc. Better nail down
which one it is before you order any parts. Congratulations if you have a
'72 with the hatch above the engine. That was the ONLY thing I missed on my
'72.
