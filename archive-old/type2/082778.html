&gt; What are all the differences between 76, 77, 78, and 79?

Off the top of my head:

76/7 almost identical.  I can't think of any differences, tho there were
some, no doubt.

'78 hydraulic lifters, as you said.  Sliding middle windows. Catalytic
converter on CA only.

'79 square port heads - one year exhaust and heater boxes.  Fed and CA
have a cat.  Electronic ignition on CA models

&gt; I know that in 78 hydraulic lifters were added.  And I think self adjusting
&gt; rear brakes came in 79, plus the different exhaust?

I *think* self adjusting brakes came in '80 on the Vanagon, tho there may
have been some '79s out there with them.  I have both a bay and a vanagon
and see no reason that the vanagon backing plates and self-adjusters could
not be retrofitted.

&gt;  Seems like westfalia interiors switched to the more durable and
&gt; non-flaking adhesive simulated wood grain in 79 too(not sure)?

I think this happened in '78, but am not 100% sure.

&gt; What year did front disk brakes become standard?

'71

Any front end changes?

Not from '73-'79.  I *know* the beams will flop straight out, having done
it.
