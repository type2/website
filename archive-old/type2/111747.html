&gt; &gt; How the heck do you get the balljoint off?
&gt;
&gt; you need something called a &quot;pickle fork&quot; inexpensive and some FLAPS rent.

If you're a kindler, gentler, type, You can also use a balljoint puller
that pushes the stud out from the nut end.  I made one from a Chevy pitman
arm puller, easily found at your FLAPS.  I made a spacer to go into the
fork of the puller to close up the hole to fit the ball joint.

&gt; &gt; I started out by trying to loosen the &quot;locknut&quot; mentioned in the Haynes
&gt; &gt; manual, only to determine that there is no locknut; as far as I can make out
&gt; &gt; the balljoint just screws onto the tie rod, period.

Hmm, there is either a clamp that locks the adjustment or no adjustment at
all on tie rods.  On the drag link there can be either a clamp or a jam
nut depending upon the age of the part.
