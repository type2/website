Subject: Las Vegas

Greeting list,
I hope this doesn't violate any list protocol but am trying to help a really
terrific 21 year old (my daughter). She has just moved to Las Vegas and is
looking for a career in either hotel management or convention/meeting
planning, etc.  Does anyone have any connections they would be willing to
pass on to a very deserving lady?  Any assistance would be appreciated.
