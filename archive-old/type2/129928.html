Big bad idea to use grease. It guarantees large overtorque. Same goes for 
anti-seize, just not right for this application. That's why they seem to be 
too tight when you try to loosen them, because grease defeats too much 
friction on the threads and they ARE way too tight. Very light viscosity 
machine oil, just a drop or two, will not cause this issue.

Clean the grease off of all of the bolts/studs/nuts, then assemble clean 
and dry or just a drop of 3in1 oil. Only then can your torque wrench 
control spec torque.
