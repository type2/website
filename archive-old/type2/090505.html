Subject: Re: [T2] Rebuilt heads needed 


&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Alas, the local boneyards are pretty well picked-over. I'm planning on
&gt; 
&gt; don't forget the engine is the same as a 73-74 412 sedan or wagen (FI is
&gt; different, but the heads should be swappable ????)

Yeah, but I've seen exactly two engines in boneyard air-cooled VWs around
here, both late '70s that have had engine fires.  When I said &quot;picked over&quot;
I meant REALLY picked over.
