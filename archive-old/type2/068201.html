Subject: Re: Do beetles float

If anyone is interested, Sports Illustrated, in the August 19, 1963 issue, 
had an article about the VW beetle, and its history, an it &quot;tested&quot; a beetle 
to see if it floated. The following is from that article:

&quot; The photograph on page 58 was made in Homosassa Springs, Fla. after a 
Volkswagen was lowered gingerly onto the water by a crane. Tony Triolo then 
took the picture with a split-image, over-and-under water camera. We do not 
recommend this experiment to others. The beetle floated, all right - but 
after 29 minutes and 12 seconds it sighed and slopped under.&quot;
