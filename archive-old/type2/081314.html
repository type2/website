Subject: re: PCH road trip (LA to Crescent City)

Myself being a former resident of Crescent City, and noting that
you've never
been that far north on Hwy 101, I sincerely hope your Bus doesn't
overheat
too frequently, or that you know when it does and are patient enough
to
pull over and let it cool. Karma is definitely necessary there...

I personally think that 101 from Eureka to Crescent City is one of the
most
beautiful drives in the world - but it could be brutal on an old loaf
chugging
through double-back 15s with a steep incline.  Ask me how I know ;-)

And my last .02: if you're going all the way to Crescent City, you
should take
another two hours and get up to Grant's Pass, Ore. The highway there
rivals
101, but you get the added beauty of following the Smith River, one of
the last
(undammed) wild and scenic rivers in California.

Perhaps you'll see my folks up there.  Good luck on your trip!!
