&gt; &gt; The state bought me a $41.47 (!) fuel cap and 2 hours _at_ $125 per hour to
get
&gt; &gt; the vehicle to pass.
&gt;
&gt; So what was done to pass it?
Actually, I don't know.  I was away when the shop called to tell my wife the
vehicle was ready, and the paperwork that was in the car (we picked it up
outside the shop after it closed last night) doesn't say anything beyond
enumerating the fuel cap and labor.  Since everything in the engine
compartment was in excellent shape and since the failure involved slightly
too-high CO the logical &quot;fix&quot; is to keep turning the air/fuel mixture screw
clockwise until the CO comes into spec.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; No out-of-pocket for me as I'd already spent more than
&gt; &gt; the Co-pay with the VW dealer.
&gt;
&gt; When I went for my own test I learned about these changes to the
assistance
&gt; program.
&gt;
&gt; The low income eligibility for repair assistance has been expanded to
cover
&gt; failures at test-only stations. If you fail emissions for any reason
except
&gt; tampering you can apply for repair assistance. The deductable is $100 on
&gt; repair work costing up to $600.
I think it's up to $500.  At least, that's what my approval letter says.  I
think the $100 co-pay is your contribution to the $500, not an add to.
