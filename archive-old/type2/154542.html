Subject: Re: [T2] Name of &quot;partial&quot; pop-top?

We call these turret tops. Doc Ric has a '68 that has this top on it:

In fact James Garrison had one of those tops to sell, but nobody makes the 
canvas replacement for it. I am not sure if he still has it. He is in 
Greensboro, NC if anyone wants it and he still has it. Let me know and I'll 
call him.
