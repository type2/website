Subject: Re: [T2] my fuel pump is all wiggly

&gt; IF you find a source for new ones let me know, I have been looking for
&gt; years, my fuel pump is held on with hose clamps but I have scarfed those
&gt; bushings whenever I could find em, but 20+ year old ones don't like being
&gt; yanked off in junque yards, and rarely survive the removal installation
&gt; process for very long

Got a Mercedes dealership near you?  Here are a couple of part numbers for
air cleaner mounts that will work for the fuel pump.
116 988 05 11  _at_ $3.00 each [list price]
or
126 958 00 11  _at_ $2.50 each [list price]
