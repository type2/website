&gt; I've had two conversations via p-mail mentioning Bus Depot's catalog blurb
&gt; about using the 72-74 heat exchanger on a 75-78 Federal bus. They say,
&gt; &quot;You'll have to modify your engine tin slightly to do this conversion.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; How do you need to modify your engine tin? Do you just need to replace the
&gt; lower left tin that covers the push rods? Or is it more extensive than that?

I think it has to do with the input for the blowers, I just picked up a
complete exhaust that has already been modified, but it is &quot;J&quot; tube style
without heat exchangers, don't see any needed changes in this set up.  I
long time ago removed the stock head system and use the gas heater for
100% of my heat.
