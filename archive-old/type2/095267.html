Subject: Re: [T2] Sound Deadening Info and Heater Blower Hoses

In my experiments to fasten it to the
&gt;inside of the doors I used a torch. With enough heat - direct flame - it 
&gt;will turn to an black oil and drip and run. Direct flame though remember.

	Did you try using a commercial heat gun?  They resemble a hair dryer, but 
get VERY hot(up to 600 degrees I think)

&gt;HEATER BLOWER HOSES
&gt;
&gt;Over the past 10 years I have bought many replacement hoses that are 
&gt;designed to connect the Beetle shroud to the heater boxes or on the Type IV 
&gt;connect the aux blower to the heater boxes. Some of the replacement hoses 
&gt;are black aluminum hoses and some were bright silver. I think I have a 
&gt;cheap source for you.


These are actually produced in a fiberglass-reinforced version as well.  
MUCH stronger, and better insulated for hear transfer.
