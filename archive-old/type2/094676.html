Not true. It is all a matter of how well the engine burns the fuel. You
can have a jet engine that will burn a couple hundred gallons of fuel
per hour and have less emissions coming out of it than out of an
improperly tuned car. Its all a matter of how the engine does on
combustion. Speaking of which, who else wants to mate a constant speed
jet-prop engine with a CVT and put it in a bus? Nothin like having to go
ask the local airport for some Jet-A for your bus. :-)

Hmm, I am reminded of the framed ad I have in our hall- that of a VW bus
neatly holding all the stuff they have sticking out and virtually
falling out of a pickup....at the time they didn't have to include that
the bus carries all that at half the gasoline consumption of the
pickup!   I believe that some states may have different standards for
RV's than passenger cars?  Most SUV's use more gpm than our busses, and
certainly our 22 mpg is better than any RV??  Thus our pollution must be
less??
