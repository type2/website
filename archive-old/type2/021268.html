I had someone steal my Airflow meter and registration sticker once.  Got
in the car and started it.. tried to drive and it was just MUSH!  Boy
was I annoyed.

Got myself an AFM, but I got pulled over so many times until I finally
got that sticker.  What a mess.  I'm going to definately try and find a
keyed lock for that back hatch.  Or maybe put a cable actuated latch
that has a pull line in the bed of the rear compartment.  That way, you
need to pull up on the cable and it allows the engine compartment to be
opened.

&gt; 
&gt; Pranksters I suspect.  The first thing I would do is get a key lock on your
&gt; engine lid if you don't already have one.  I wouldn't be surprised if
&gt; tomorrow morning all the hoses are off and something else is awry.  I had
&gt; problems a few years ago and someone was continually messing around in my
&gt; engine compartment even took my coil.  Once while out of state taking nap in
&gt; 24hr walmart parking lot I heard two guys talking about how easy it would be
&gt; to reach in my engine compartment and yank some wires to leave me stranded.
&gt; I quietly crawled to the front and started her up and drove off.  I hope I'm
&gt; wrong,  Mark
