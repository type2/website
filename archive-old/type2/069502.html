Subject: FOR SALE '6? Westy

This one is local IE Morgantown WV.

This bus really saddens me, 3-4 years ago I tracked down owner and
inquired and got the typical, well I've been meaning to restore her.
At the time it still had enough paint protecting it such that most
of the surface was still solid.

Condition Now

Late 60's I'd imagine '64-'66 Velvet Green non pop top, non walk through
Westy Camper
6V
looks to be a 1500
Last run '79
Body pretty rough, ie needs rockers, drivers side front fender/dog leg,
probably a couple of jack points, extreme outer edges of front floor
bad (not as bad as some, say to 3&quot; in), bottoms of cargo doors, and 
mating sill.  However the floor generally looks solid, as do most
outriggers, and the interior of the rear wheelwells.  Rear corners OK
rust where they meet the piece behind the engine.  Oddly windshields
have not leaked much and dash under them in good shape.  This bus had
been in much better condition cause as the edges had started to rust PO
had at least sprayed primer on them, but it has failed and surface
rust originating at paint failure has spread rampantly since I
last saw it.

The only bonus to this bus is that the interior is quite OK for its
age, unfortunately the last 10 years it has sat with every one of the
jaloise (sp?) openn, but most of the plywood is still in very 
presentable shape, closet, roof, side panels, etc.  With the exception
of the spice racks and the top of the ice box both of which have
sustained water damage.  The bed upholsery looked in fine condition and
the grey rubber front mats under the seats, were in better condition 
than most I have seen of loafs, only minor tears.

Probably a good parts camper bus, but the right fool could restore it,
it really is just teetering at that brink where if you had sentimental
reasons or lived in Great Britain say, you'd fix it.  Running gear is
unknown, front axle still looked solid, engine, tranny are there, thats
all I'll conjecture.  She's sitting wheels buried 5&quot; in the ground.
I'd say $2500+ in body work if you had it done sort of condition.

Worth the $500 he's asking?  He'd likely take much less.  Anyone
interested contact me, I'll try to get ahold of the guy, no phone
number just a For Sale sign and he's notoriously hard to get from past 
experience.
