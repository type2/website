Subject: Re: [T2] Leaking Oil

it can be done with the engine in but i couldnt even begin to go into that in my mind much less in physical being.
It is trully better to drop the engine back down if this is your concern of where the oil is coming from?
Did you torque the heads down correctly?
to the right lbs.?
did you use your seals?
good luck
peace

I'm leaking a fair amount of oil after engine install. I have been advised and I have started to replace the push rod seals. After getting underneath I noticed a fair amount of accumulation around the &quot;jugs&quot; or cylinder heads. Not sure of the nomenclature. Is there a way to remove the said parts without removing the engine. I'll have the head off replaceing the push rod seals already. Just wondering how far I can go without removing engine......again........ :-(
