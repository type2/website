Subject: '69 doors need help!

on my 69 westy, my door latches..umm, wont.
the worst offender is the rear one on the sliding door, closely followed by 
the front one...when you slide the door shut, it likes to pop open again 
(often just the rear will pop out, and the door stays semi-shut) when 
closing it takes several tries to get everything shut

sometimes when opening the door, the latches wont open and its necessary to 
open from the inside by holding the handle in the open position and punching 
the area behind the rear latch

any ideas on how to remedy this?
thanx
