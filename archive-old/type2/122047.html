Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel pump question

&gt;I think Marco must have been thinking of the non-FI &gt;tank.

Probably.

&gt;Eh, I'm not going to hold a tank outlet description &gt;mistake against these guys

That's your move.  You're in a more urban area than me (central valley, CA) and your access to quality shops is hopefully better.

For my part, it really irks me when people I pay 50-60 dollars an hour to get ANYTHING wrong. There is a consensus among some (followers of Muir) that you're the only mechanic for your bus.

It's not a reality for everyone, and I'm not trying to go there.  But you can't argue that it's not the only guarantee you have of quality/correctness.

I'm sounding like the Dok, but this is my experience Jason. I've followed your chronicles with the Berkeley shops and even lived there as a bus-owner myself. YMMV, right?

&gt;Every experience I've had with Buslab has been &gt;positive, and I would recommend them to anyone in a &gt;heartbeat.

Excellent. My post reflects only my own opinions and experiences on a topic you brought up. I discredit you or the Buslab in no way.

Billy
