Subject: Re: [T2] Stewart Warner Gas Heater Question/Problem

Sounds like you are missing one of the O rings for the spark plug.  Check my
web site and click on the spark plug and see the picture.  Also, there is a
proper gap and alignment for the ground, you can set the ground with the
tool shown on the web site and the gap also which should be .080.  That's a
good place for the heater, it will circulate the air inside the bus heating
it up much faster.  Be sure to check all fuel lines and have new ones made
locally if they look cracked.  Use only the pressure lines with pressed on
fittings.  NEVER use hose clamps.

&gt; I've looked though the manual but couldn't find my answer so am asking
&gt; the list.  
&gt; 
&gt; The spark plug to the heater does not fit snuggly.  I can pull it up
&gt; and down about an 1/8 of an inch.  There is a metal O ring on the top
&gt; side of the plug.  I'm assuming that the 1/8 inch play should not be
&gt; there?  Am I correct in my assumption?  I am wondering if I'm missing
&gt; another O ring on the bottom side or what?  Any help would greatly be
&gt; appreciated. 
&gt; 
&gt; I ask this question because I am having a problem with keeping the
&gt; heater going.  It will run nicely for awhile and then stop heating.
&gt; It will start to blow cold air because the heater is not firing.  I go
&gt; back and wiggle the spark plug wire at the spark plug and it fires
&gt; right up.  The strange part is that the spark plug wire is like stuck
&gt; to the spark plug because it requires a little force to wiggle the
&gt; wire but then frees up right away.  It's got to be a bad connection
&gt; but I don't understand why because the spark plug wire is tight on the
&gt; spark plug.  
&gt; 
&gt; The heater is installed under my Z-bed so it doesn't take much to lift
&gt; the seat and wiggle the wire but it's not working the way it should so
&gt; any help would greatly be appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Kevin
