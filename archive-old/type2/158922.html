Subject: Re: Breakdown in CA: Help needed (Update IT'S FIXED!!!!)

&gt;Well, guess what? It was the filter and/or the fat hose between the filter
&gt;and the pump. That hose was disintegrating, and looked like it was
&gt;collapsing when the pump ran. The filter was full of rubber chunks too.

umm, would this be a good time to say 'everyone replace your fuel lines?'

if you don't know how old your fuel lines are, or if they're more than 
__ years old--
REPLACE YOUR FUEL LINES!!!

ALL OF THEM!!!

Already this year, I've heard of a few buses burning on the side of the 
highway--
please help stop the madness.
