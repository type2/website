&gt; I have searched the archives and haven't found an

&gt; references to look back at the archives, so I did and
&gt; still need help. If someone has a diagram, that would
&gt; do it. Otherwise I will go ahead and describe the
&gt; hoses that I need help with. OK, Here it goes:

Here's are some diagrams:

&gt; -The two hoses from the distributor advance canister.

I think in general the hose from the outer nipple on the vacuum can is the
advance side and goes into the throttle body and is tee'd at the EEC valve
on the air cleaner.

The inner one, the retard side, tees into right side of the air distribution
box between 3/4 cylinders where the hose goes to the pressure regulator.

&gt; - The hose from the EGR valve.

This diagram is for the SVDA dizzy but you can see that there is a 3-way tee
(dist/air-cleaner/throttle). I understand on your model with the
non-mechanical EGR, the tee is 4 way and the other line goes to the EGR
valve.

&gt; -There is a hose coming off of the vacuum pipe that
&gt; connects to the brake assist upfront, it is located
&gt; just forward of the firewall tin and forward of a
&gt; one-way valve- (I believe that's what it is) in the
&gt; line. 

http://www.nls_dot_net/mp/volks/schem/vac.gif

The brake booster tees into the air distribution box and goes to the decel
valve in the firewall.

&gt; I have one more piece that I'm not sure of; it is a
&gt; cast piece, part #022131519, it is about 1-1/4&quot; long
&gt; and about 5/8&quot; diameter, it has a 1/2&quot; long M8 stud
&gt; protruding from the bottom and two small vacuum
&gt; nipples on the top (one on each end).

This is a temperature switch according to ETKA but I'm not sure where it
goes.  Anyone?
