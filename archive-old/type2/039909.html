&gt;    You gotta be kidding. , . , ., , . ,

	So let me get this right: You paid $??? for the bus,
will pay $??? for beer'n'pizza for your friends to help, won't pay
$35 for the factory approved shop manual. Consider this again.
Even if you paid $200 for the bus and stiff your friends. You
paid $35 for Muir if you bought it new.

	You can get along with Haynes. $18. Nearly as good. Pictures
are better, text sometimes not as thorough. You could try to use
Clymer (p.u.!) or Chiltons for $2 at a yard sale. They're 
incomplete, to put it kindly.

	You wanna work on your car, you buy books. You want the book of
choice, its the Bentley. You want it today, maybe you pay full
boat retail. Cruise the used shops and you might pay $8 like I
did years ago. Hit the right yard sale and collect one for $1.
You're paying for convenience.

	Happy motoring.
	Bill
