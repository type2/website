&gt;I put the first 150 miles on the new engine.  Seemed to run well, and
&gt;after advancing the timing some, I cured most of the dieseling.  All I
&gt;got on the last time I turned it off was a single &quot;pop&quot;.  Not a
&gt;backfire, really more of a burp.  I'm going to advance the timing a
&gt;little more, but I'm getting worried.  At idle, I've got the timing at
&gt;~11 degrees BTDC.  Isn't this getting high for a Type IV engine?  Or
&gt;should I just be worried about its maximum advance? (050 mechanical
&gt;distributor).
&gt;
&gt;The first gauge results are in, as well.  The CHT gauge gives me ~325
&gt;degrees once it all warms up.  Oil pressure starts out around 60 psi,
&gt;but as it warms up drops to around 21 psi at 3000 rpm.
&gt;
&gt;There's a slight worry, however:  when it's warmed up and the rpms drop
&gt;to idle speed, I've gotten an occaisional oil light flicker, which
&gt;according to the gauge is just under 10 psi.  I'm using straight 40 wt
&gt;Castrol, and the temp isn't going wild.  I haven't lost any oil, so I'm
&gt;wondering if it's something to do with the pump?  Could a valve be
&gt;failing to close?  Or is it that the stock VW sender is just so low that
&gt;I normally wouldn't see this, and it's just that the VDO sender triggers
&gt;the idiot light at a higher psi?

All sounds well to me, but my experience is with a 1600DP engine.  Concerning 
the run-on: is the idle shutoff solenoid connected?  (If your engine is FI, 
just disregard that question.)

Regarding the idiot light: I, too, have a VDO oil pressure gauge with the 
double sending unit.  At idle, I get the occasional idiot light flicker 
(sometimes even a steady light), but pressure never drops below, say, 7 psi.  
All in all, my engine is pretty healthy AFAIK.  I have considered going back 
to the old, original idiot light sender and just T-ing it with a VDO single 
(pressure only) sender.

CHT temp for me is about 325 after warmitup and with no load on the engine, 
but get me going up a hill, it will go up to 375.  Any higher, and I start to 
worry.  If it is a looooong grade, I will pullitover and rest, if I'm almost 
there I will tuffitout or downshift.
