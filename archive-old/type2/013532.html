Hi Volks,

I calibrated my VDO oil pressure gauge using a spare
tire for calibration air pressure.  I found it to be
way off on the low end.  Bus Depot replaced it for no
charge, although I had to pay them for the second
gauge and wait for my refund on the first.  So if you
want better accuracy without spending a fortune, rig
yourself a calibration set up and see how far off your
gauges really are.  By the way, boiling water is a
good calibration point for oil temperature.

Rob
