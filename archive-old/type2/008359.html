Subject: oil leak

I have a steady drip coming down the oil filter of my '78 2.0 litre.
I'm sure the filter is tight. Any ideas? I've seen the leak as a steay 
squirt every other second or so (couldn't tell where it came from but 
seems to be coming from the top of the filter) and as a slow drip down 
the side of the filter. Any help appreciated. Thanks.
