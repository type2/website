Subject: Low oil pressure on '78 when warm

It used to be that at idle when cold, my '78 would have 60+ PSI of oil pressure
and when warm (150-210 degrees) it would have 45 psi+ of oil pressure.

In the last few weeks (even after I changed the oil), the cold pressure is about 
the same, but the pressure when warm is much lower. For example, at 150 degrees
it might be 35 PSI and at 180 degrees it is barely over 20 PSI.

I am using 15W50 Synthetic oil.

Any ideas what could cause this change? 

Is this going to damage my engine?

Thanks for any help.
