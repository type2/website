Hey,
A friend of John's has a 1970 VW bus for sale, and after listening to your
stories about your daughter, well...I wondered if she has Internet access &amp;
VW connections, if we could get her and Michael connected?
He's got a pge up with pictures of the bus at
http://www.michaelmclaughlin_dot_net/. To contact him a person would have to
send mail to him at  michael_at_michaelmclaughlin_dot_net (he forgot to put an
email link on the page).

It might not even have made much difference to them if they'd known exactly 
how much power the President of the Galaxy actually wielded: none at all. 
Only six people in the
Galaxy knew that the job of the Galactic President was not to wield power 
but to attract attention away from it.
