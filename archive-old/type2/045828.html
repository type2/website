&gt;  I have heard of these VW Aux gas fired heaters, but I was hearing that
&gt;  they are too dangerious.  Who knows how educated my source was on these
&gt;  items, but...  I would be interested in hearing more about these.

VW built them into many of their products, including all? of the 411 and
412 models, I bought a 412 for my wife and kids,  I wouldn't have put them
in a car I thought was going to blow up, or even have a chance of blowing
up......now all that being said the last 412 was the 74 which means they
are 25+ years old now...after tearing into mine (with shop manual, in
library) I found that thing had more safety switches and interlocks that
it was much harder to get it to start than anything else.. .take it
carefull and make it right, or get someone who can.  and you will have a
nice warm ride.

now as an aside, I have also added 3 additional manual overide safety
shutdown switches to it.

&gt; Where can I get one for my 77 T2,

junkyard
internet
actually finding one in a van.

 and how safe are they?

as safe as the rehab and instalation

  What am I looking to spend as well?

I guess not counting time I have a couple hundred tied up in materiels,
including the ducting, switches, blowers etc

&gt; &gt;&gt; I am curious if anyone out there has a 78 T2 bus with the factory heating
&gt; &gt;&gt; system (heat exchange) that actually keeps you warm in the winter.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I have a 78 and put in a VW aux gas fired heater,  I stay warm, now
