Subject: Re: [T2] Advice neaded,



&gt; Hi Folks,
&gt; 
&gt;  I will be  taking a trip across the U.S.A  and Canada  at the end of
&gt; February . I live in Quebec
&gt; Canada near the Vermont border. I would like to drive south to 
Florida
&gt; first, then across to California
&gt;  then up the west coast to Vancouver Canada and back to Quebec.
&gt; 
&gt;  This being  my first long trip in my 1975 newly restored  Westy. I
&gt; would really appreciate it  if
&gt;  any of you experienced folks would give me advice as to where I 
could
&gt; camp cheaply while on the road, (newly retired couple) and what to 
look
&gt; for as far as security

Conditions are wildly variable throughout the US.  There are some 
places that are perfectly fine, and others that are rather nasty.  The 
best thing to do is to contact AIRS or listees along your route and 
ask their advice.

George
