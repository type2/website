&gt;I knew mentioning cutting the cabinets would draw some responses (not to
&gt;mention the less than literate, obscene one I recieved privately:).

&gt;So if these cabinets are so valuable (in original shape) to someone else,
&gt;then I invite that someone else to build me a replacement cabinet set.  I'll
&gt;give you __TWO__ cabinets, and a fridge/sink unit:)  Plus, believe it or
&gt;not, I am a nice guy.  I'd fill you with yummy beer and food and tell you
&gt;silly stories while you were around:)


Sorry to hear about your responses, but you find those kind of people in
every group.  This list is a lot of fun, but there is always someone
without any comon sense of respect that wants to ruin it for everyone.

If you let us know where you are, I'm sure someone will take you up on your
offer, it would be a wonderful way to meet another bus person and the
cabinets would be great to have!
