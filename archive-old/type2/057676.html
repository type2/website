Subject: Tachometer wiring hint...

For the guy who asked for help wiring his brand-x tach a few days ago:

In case you haven't already discovered what the WHITE wire is for, it
should be hooked up to your dash lights.  And as you already know, the
green goes to the neg. side of the coil, the red goes to keyed 12v
positive (only hot when ignition is on), and black is ground.
