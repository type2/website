&gt;I have been keeping my ball joints going by greasing them but I am soon 
&gt;going to have to replace them since the boots are torn (really almost 
&gt;nonexistent).  How big a job is it?  What does it entail to do both sides?

&gt;How long should I expect to spend?  I have manuals but would appreciate 
&gt;any advice, hints, pitfalls that await before starting.  Both sides, upper 
&gt;and lower need replacing.

Go check out http://type2_dot_com  then click on the big &quot;Library&quot; splash on the
left side of the screen.  Then click on &quot;B&quot; and then on &quot;Ball Joints&quot;.
There's some really good info out there (about damn-near anything you want
to do to your bus).  If you can't get there, let me know and I can p-mail
the ball-joint write-up.
