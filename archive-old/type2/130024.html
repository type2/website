&gt;Cool. I may still do the bar like the Volvo wagons. They have the bar

Not cool for me - the mount is too low.  The only way I would use such a 
system is to secure a child seat, or a small child whos shoulders are at or 
below the top of the seatback, and then only if the seatback is strong 
enough not to collapse in an accident (or if the crossbar is used).  I will 
change my opinion when someone shows me some concrete evidence that such a 
low shoulder belt mount point is safe.  A strong scientific study, for 
example, or an application in a NHTSA-approved, factory stock vehicle.
