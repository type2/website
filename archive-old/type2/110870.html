Hello David,

My bus has the solid partition. I like the walk
througs but I think the front bench seat has its own
advantages. I am pretty happy with it.

Have a great Day!

Regards,

David Kelly

&gt; 
&gt; Does your 74 have a solid partition or does it have
&gt; the walkthrough-type
&gt; split partition with a bench seat across it?  I've
&gt; only seen 72 and back
&gt; nonwalkthroughs, though...
