Hi all -

Well, Bob was right when he replied &quot;OH OH&quot; as regards my input shaft coming 
out w/the motor instead of staying in the tranny/connected by stud to the 
input shaft in the geartrain housing.

Today I removed the clutch housing and found:  the reverse gear still slid 
over the &quot;inner&quot; input shaft, stud still in the &quot;inner&quot; input shaft, circlip 
attached to magnet on the drain plug.  My stomach can't take much more of 
this...

Anyhow, I'm suspecting that the input shafts haven't been connected 
since...?  I have to look over the maintenance &amp; see if there's ever been 
ANY tranny work or the motor pulled.  I looked these over when I purchased, 
&amp; I don't recall seeing anything of the like.  Could this have made it from 
the factory like this?  My brain hurts as I try &amp; think up some scenario 
that would enable the reverse gear to back off of the forward/inner input 
shaft &amp; spin (?) the rear shaft off, then somehow line back up &amp; slide back 
over the forward shaft (?!).  My knowledge of transmissions is confined to 
what I've read &amp; looked at today, so I don't know if those shafts are 
supposed to move forward &amp; back during driving &amp; shifting.  I think probably 
not.  I have to believe someone worked on this, got the differential, 
adjusting rings, etc. all put back in &amp; went &quot;Oh golly, guess I'll just line 
things up, slide the reverse gear forward, &amp; put the circlip back on.&quot;

I thought up the latter scenario as I tried, w/differential still in, to 
manage &amp; connect the shafts w/reverse gear on.  Optimism aside, I quickly 
realized this was impossible w/differential still in (right?).  What fed my 
false hope?  I thought I could wiggle things around, get stud started, &amp; 
creep reverse gear forward off of differential (which made for the 
impossible angle in the first place).  You guessed it.  I now know the 
correct (?) procedure, at the expense of the first couple threads on the 
stud.  Now I have to find a stud.  I was referred to a dealer, and they 
aren't picking up.  Advice, advice for the depraved?! (I'll keep trying, of 
course).

Also, it looks like I'm going to need a &quot;VW special tool&quot; to remove the 
adjusting rings.  Anyone have any ideas?  I'm told to check the dealer on 
that, too.  Or:  does anyone know how to fake a semblance of this very 
special tool?  I don't have a &quot;vernier&quot; or micrometer, so I just plan on 
marking/scoring the adjusting ring &amp; edge of the gearbox, then counting 
turns (ala Hayes alternative).

Sorry so long everyone, but typing helps take the edge off right now.  I'd 
love to hear from you.

Thanks to all,

Mark
