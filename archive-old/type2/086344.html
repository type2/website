Chuck,

better still, give us a manufacturer/part number and the name/phone of the cabinet shop/distributor. If it matches counter tops for 79's, doesn't that mean it matches a lot of other furniture in a lot of other busses?

maybe we (the list) could buy in bulk?

has the T2 administration/list ever thought of reselling bulk purchased products to list members, hopefully saving list members money on product whilst funding the T2 coffers?
