Subject: RE: [T2] Waterbed (was Now I've Heard It All!)


Just to put this one to rest,
	I have a feeling there were probably flower pots(or a derivative of one or 
both of those words), growing in the engine bay, and the vehicle probably 
didn't roll.  Back in the sixties(in which I was conceived), San Francisco 
was even looser than it is now.

&gt;Hello list,
&gt;
&gt;The only way that I could see a water bed being
&gt;feasible is if it were no more than 6&quot; tall. If I were
&gt;to do somthing like this, I would use the regular Z
&gt;bed and have the water bladder deflated and rolled up
&gt;until you planned on using it. When you got to the
&gt;camp sight, you would have to roll out the water
&gt;bladder over the open Z bed and fill it with a water
&gt;hose. I sure as heck would not drive it for any
&gt;distance with it fully inflated. Even then, It would
&gt;be safer to have a lined frame around it.
&gt;
&gt;That is what I think of it.
&gt;
