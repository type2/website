Subject: Attn Wannabussers! 65 Deluxe Walkthrough FS!

Hey folks...

Fella I rescued the 66 rustywesty from last year gave me a call (he was
moving, wasnt going to move the 66...) and said he needs to sell his 65.

If i recall his story right, this is a second owner bus, his grandfather
was the PO.

It has a new(?) or rebuilt tranny in it, and an economy rebuilt motor..(he
put 600 into the tranny, 450 in the motor..)

White over blue, walkthrough deluxe.  Body is about normal for a 65, as is
the rust....all the usual places.  If you are SERIOUS about this, i can go
out and take a look.  (about 45 miles from my house...)

He's hoping for 1000$ but I know he'll take 800.  He needs money to buy a
truck.  said he has put a new master cylinder in it, too...

Memory says all the seats are there, but interior condition unknown (it
was loaded for the move last I saw it....)

His name is Mike Owen and he can be reached at 706-560-1300.

Bus is located in Augusta Georgia.

you now know what I do!:)

...david
