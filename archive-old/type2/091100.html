&gt; &gt;i have seen bilboards here in tulsa, ok for people to donate cars, boats
&gt; &gt;and other things to charities. i never looked into where they go, though.
&gt; &gt;now i have to wonder! then again, if they are scrapping them, then why do
&gt; &gt;they need to be running? i dont know if it matters if it runs, here.

In California, they have a scrappage program supposedly to reduce
pollution.  Since a non-running vehicle cannot pollute the air, the state
won't give any money for them, or for a vehicle that hasn't been
registered for the last two years.  I've seen some _very_ sick engines at
the scrappage site!

I had a non-repairable non-VW rustbucket with an
engine that consumed equal quantities of gas, oil, and coolent.  I
stripped the interior, put old tires on it and carefully drove to the
scrap yard.  I took out the battery and put in a deader with the engine
running and drove the thing in.  This was the worst assemblage of parts
every to roll in the same car, but it was worth the same $400 that every
other car of that year was worth.  At that time the vehicles would be
immediately crushed.  I think that they are now allowing parts to be
taken before crushing which should keep a few buses on the road.

The saddest thing was, at the same time I was there a late bay westy
there and it sat there idleing nicely.  I talked to the guy and he was
scrapping it because he couldn't get it to pass smog.  Unfortunately he
was ahead of me and had already done the deed.  I just about cried.
