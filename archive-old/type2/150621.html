&amp;gt; I've heard tell that these new &amp;quot;meximotors&amp;quot; have domed pistons for a

That is my understanding.  I think that the pistons are dished, not domed.

&amp;gt; I am finding that the drive to work is a little slower.  I have a few
&amp;gt; hills on the way, and sometimes on the bigger hills, I have to
&amp;gt; downshift.  I didn't have to do this before.

My experience too.

&amp;gt; At the same time that I got the new engine, I also got an SVDA
&amp;gt; distributor.  Could this be a factor?  I am tempted to put the old 009
&amp;gt; back in and see if there's any difference.

I've done the switch the other way and find that the power doesn't change
noticably.  I did before and after tests up my &amp;quot;dyno hill&amp;quot; and found that
the time to accelerate remained exactly the same.

OTOH, drivability is much better with the SVDA (205) distributor.  Don't
waste your money on the 009.

You lose some power, but the tradeoff is that your engine will _never_
ping or detonate.  It'll run on the cheapest gas you can find.
