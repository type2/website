&gt;Can't agree more. I started my motoring with a pre war clunker and could
run
&gt;it all in (in the 60's) for about 5 UK pounds, say +ACQ-8 a week, by doing
all
&gt;my own fixing and rescuing parts from wrecks, despite the fact that British
&gt;fuel was and is far more expensive than US. I still have that sort of
&gt;mentality, though I don't need to be quite so tight any longer.
