Subject: Re: Re: [T2] What color is stock?!

Thanks Tim, (and thanks everyone else for all the responses too...)


I guess I've narrowed it down for sure to three colors...

1 - Body Color
2 - White
3 - light silver


I think I'll have to get someone who is awesome at photoshop to try to mess with my picture so I can see all three.



Thanks!!!

Todd

&gt; Hi Todd
&gt; 
&gt; the wheels on Australian Microbuses were mainly  a 'soft' silver  
&gt; finish.  I have just checked with a new book called &quot;Volkswagen in  
&gt; Australia, the Forgotten Story&quot;.  There are several photos of 73 and  
&gt; 74 Microbuses/campers/vans all having the 'soft' silver wheel finish.
