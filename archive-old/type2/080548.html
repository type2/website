&gt;I always assumed that changes in these areas over the years and the
&gt;subsequent need for changes in the advance curve _are_the reason for the many
&gt;different distributor models used over the years.

I would guess that some are, but that there are other reasons such as 
advances in distributor design, changing emissions requirements, changing 
fuel-economy requirements, etc. that might also have been responsible for a 
distributor change.

&gt;I guess the basic question
&gt;is how many of the changes that create a need for altering the advance curve
&gt;are associated with bottom end case/crank/rod design and how many are related
&gt;to top end &quot;everything else&quot;.

Yup - and I doubt any of us know the complete answer to that one.

&gt;Its kind of humorous to see how many in the aftermarket parts industry
&gt;expects us to overlook 40 years of constant engineering developments and the
&gt;many engine &quot;recipes&quot; folks use to enhance the performance of ACVW's when
&gt;they sell us the &quot;one size fits all&quot; advance curve of a straight out the box
&gt;.009.

Knowledge is power, and without the collective knowledge of this list, most 
people just don't know any better.  I certainly didn't - I fell for the 
&quot;009 upgrade&quot; story back in the eighties and bought one new, then spent a 
few months scratching my head trying everything under the sun to get the 
bus to run well.  I finally removed it and put the stocker back in, and all 
of the problems went away!  It was in a box in my garage for a few years 
until I sold it to Steve Maher (the guy with the Vanagon with the Chevy V-6 
in it - anyone remember?) for use in an older type1.  It was still shiny 
when I sold it.
