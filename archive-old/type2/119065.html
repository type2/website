Subject: RE: [T2] It runs!

Congrats! Always a good feeling... I was asking the list about using an O2
sensor to set mixture in my bus a couple weeks ago, and the general
consensus was that yes you can watch the mixture change and know if it's
rich, lean, or peak, but there's no way to set it to an exact CO% without a
gas analyzer. I thought of taking a baseline reading after the shop set the
CO, but I'd have to install an O2 sensor to experiment. If you find out any
different, pls let me know.

15&quot; sounds a little low (I get 20&quot;), you might want to check for vacuum
leaks.
