Subject: rebuilding a 1600 - a few Qs
Message-Id: &lt;v02130502b32612e69e9f_at_[208.240.161.106]&gt;

Dropped the motor this weekend... temps were going up, pull seemed less,
rpms up for given speed. Plus, #3 was running 85/90 psi, the rest at 110.
Engine had been 'rebuilt'  10 years and 20,000 miles ago (hey, I bike....).
Always ran fine till recently.

Inspected the head on the left side; sticky exhaust valve, prolly due to
oiling. I had inadvertently left the two rings on the oilring  aligned
improperly. Oh well, I learned something.  Cylinders looked passable, some
mottling where surface rust had formed during loooong layups, been scraped
off at startup.  One piston (#3) showed signs of something having whacked
into its underside a few times at some point, a few tiny nicks. No damage
anywhere else... odd, as the pistons were new when installed.  Odder still
that no bits of metal ever showed up in the screen.
Oil pump was badly scored, however.
On closer inspection - like with a borescope :)  -  I noticed that the
lifter on #1 exhaust looked odd. Dark, and kinda sparkly.  Also, the spacer
on the crank (next to distro gear) was slightly loose, accounting for a
fast 'rattly' sound from the case that I previously could never chase down.
Looked for this specifically coz a List member mentioned it a few weeks
ago!
Figured the heck with it, and split the case. Came apart with 10 or so taps
&gt;from a rubber mallet. Simply lifted off the right side, left the crank and
cam undisturbed in the left side.
Found that the #1 Ex lifter was pitted, scored, dished and BROKEN at points
around the circumference! Yikes. It is also a different style than the
other 7; has a smaller oilport chamfer, smaller head thickness, different
angle on the mushroom part. Did the rebuilder accidently drop a late 40hp
lifter in here?

Bearing saddles looked fine on 1 and 3, but the half of the bearing that
stayed in 2 was mottled, scored and wonky looking. I imagine that the bits
that broke off the lifter promptly went round the case before the screen
got em - perhaps this is also what flew into the #3 piston bottom?. Crank
journal looked a little scored, too.  The cam bearings looked better, but
not like I wanted. Oddly, the cam shows NO signs of wear, even on the #1
lobe.
Rods &gt;looked&lt; ok, save, again, #3, which has some nicks on the piston
bearing. Sideplay seemed excessive on #2.

Questions:  I am assuming I need a new bearing set. Any good reasons why I
DON'T are welcome!
How do I determine if the cam is worn or not? Rebuilder said it was a new
one, looks it. As I believe #1 and #3 share a lobe somewhere, would the
dished, spalled lifter at #1 EX cause cam wear that would show up as valve
oddness in #3 somewhere, ie, is this the culprit on my bad PSI/sticky
valve?
What should be a sign that the crank needs reground, rather than just
polished?  Will replacing rods 2 &amp; 3 do any good, or should all 4 go?
All the lifters looked like regrinds (had the radial striations). I am
replacing all; anything else, like pushrods need to go? Also, I know that
a few Listees are running hydraulic lifters on solid cams, with no ill
effects; I am assuming these are pancakes. Any similar bolt-on for an
upright?

Lastly, my endplay was dead-on, no leaks from the oil seal either. Not
having a big enough socket, I simply split the case w/ the gland nut and
flywheel still on. Will any badness happen if I simply RESEAL the case
w/out touching this end? Will endplay need to be reset?

Anyone wanna bet that this will be just the first of a few such posts?  :)
