The one that german supply sells looks like it has those dimples, but is 
also the one that Nathan purchased and mentioned having to modify to 
make fit. 071 251 053 E is the part number.

perhaps they didnt match the photo with the part number properly, or 
maybe those little indents just weren't enough.

&gt; Actually it's a PIA for the Vanagons. Not enough clearance 
&gt; for the heater tubes. Some guys bash them in to make the 
&gt; muffler fit, but a better idea is to sandwich a bunch of 
&gt; gaskets between the muffler and heater boxes. For my van I 
&gt; cut off the mounting flanges from the old stock exhaust and 
&gt; used them as spacers. Fit like a charm.


  That depends on the muffler. In Europe two versions of the muffler were
  offered, one that had a few carefully placed &quot;dimples&quot; that allowed it to
  clear the heater tubes, and one that didn't and therefore only fit a 
Bus. In
  the U.S., you can get the Dansk version with the dimples but not the Ernst
  version.
