Subject: New front brake disc squeal/follow-up

Hello Listers:

Thanks to all who responded to my call for help after I installed new front 
brake discs and pads on my '76 Campmobile. I...did not properly clean the 
new front discs before installation; resulting in an ear-shattering squeal 
when applying the brakes.

Last night I pulled the new pads out and cleaned everything with brake 
cleaner, sanded the pads to remove glazing, reapplied anti-squeal goop to 
the backs of the pads and reassembled everything.  No squeal is now the 
result.

Lesson learned..cleanliness is everything.  Thanks again.

Walt Fogle
