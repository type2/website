&gt;The price is $5800. and it is firm.

Since you are asking, I will assume you are serious, and provide a 
serious answer.

First, it is unlikely that she will get $5800 for this bus. You might 
want to wait her out, until the firm price starts to thaw.

But if you like the bus, and don't want to lose it, here are some 
suggestions.

$5800 is _way_ too much to pay for a bus in as-is condition. Tell her 
you'll pay, but she has to get the heat and the brakes seen to first.

Also, I would insist on a one-year guarantee. Here's how to do it: go to 
a lawyer, have him draw up a simple contract, and set aside $2000 of the 
purchase price in a kind of escrow account that the lawyer controls. If 
anything happens to the bus in the first year, the cost of repairs comes 
out of that fund. If it runs perfectly for a year, the seller gets the 
money. 

If she doesn't agree to this, see my first suggestion above.
