Subject: Re: [T2] safety net for my daugter to sleep upstair wanted

While I do not yet have kids I am interested in something similar to safely carry my upright bass above the heads of my two dogs.


&gt; Hi guys, 
&gt; 
&gt; Is anyone knows where to get/buy a safety net which can prevent child 
&gt; from defying gravity in case they fall from the top bed. 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks 
&gt;
