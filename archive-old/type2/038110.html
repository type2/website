If it makes it to New Mexico or Arizona we would be happy to get it to the
west coast
where it would get the journey of a lifetime, it probably would make it's
way to Canada.

I rescued it from Mark Pribanic Sunday morning in Jacksonville, FL 
who was holding it since February waiting for Thomas Stillwell to 
come pick it up.

A VintageBus list member has it and will be transporting it to 
EveryBus in hopes of passing it off for it's next leg of it's 
journey...
