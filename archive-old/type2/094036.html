Subject: Re: [T2] Bizarre mutant VW-Ford Stretch!

I have seen several stretch projects develop twists and bows after a 
year or two of use.  It is not easy to redesign a good frame for a 
stretch.

&gt; Look under &quot;vehicle condition&quot;, for references to the creator of this 
&gt; odd VW
&gt; hybrid and his meticulous habits. God knows how much money went into 
&gt; this
&gt; project and now it's going for 1K. Looks pretty good, but why is the 
&gt; owner
&gt; dumping it so cheap? Jan B &gt;&gt;
&gt; Unless it's a recognised &quot;kitcar&quot; - One from an established 
&gt; manufacturer like
&gt; Caterham or Spectre - It's hard to set a price, other than whatever 
&gt; someone
&gt; else will pay...Besides, I'd be curious as to the handling of this 
&gt; VW...It
&gt; takes
&gt; an awful lot to &quot;stretch&quot; anything and keep all the bits in line. I'd 
&gt; hate to
&gt; be
&gt; the one to find out that this thing has deficiencies at 60 mph...8-(
