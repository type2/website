Subject: VW-Audi Relay 811 919 096, what is it for?

From; Nigel A. Skeet

Reply to: naskeet_at_hotmail_dot_com

Dear Listees.

Sometime ago, I acquired a job lot of relays for my 1991cc, VW Type 4 
engined, 1973 VW '1600' Type 2, amongst which there was a VW-Audi relay.

It bears the part No. 811 919 096 and what appears to be the date 12th 
December 1984.

It has three 6.3mm blade terminals; labelled 15, 31 &amp; unmarked, plus two 
2.8mm blade terminals labelled 1 &amp; SAS.

Can anyone tell me what it is for?

Regards.

         Nigel A. Skeet
