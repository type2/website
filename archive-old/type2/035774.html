Subject: testing coil with ohm meter--how much is &quot;much&quot;?

Hi, folks--

I'm checking my coil with an ohm meter and Chilton 
manual, because the qualitative test [color of spark] 
didn't convince me--too much sunlight to feel sure what 
color the spark was. [Although it *seemed* yellowish, 
and the new Bosch plugs with barely 1/2 engine-hour on 
them are already sooted up, and cold spark is one of 
the possible causes of that, so . . .]

The secondary resistance [between terminals 1 (negative)
and 4 (center)] is 10,000 ohms.  Chilton says it should 
be between 7,000 and 12,000, so that's okay.

But the primary resistance [between terminal 1 
(negative) and 15 (positive)] consistently reads at 3 
ohms, maybe the tiniest fraction more.  According to 
Chilton, &quot;the ohmmeter should read between 1.7 and 2.1 
ohms.  If much higher, replace the coil.&quot;

&quot;Much higher?&quot;  What does *that* mean?

Is 3 ohms &quot;much&quot; higher than 1.7 - 2.0 ohms?  Should I 
replace the coil?  Chilton's usually clearer about 
go/no go measurements [e.g., testing spark plug wires]. 

Any advice would be welcome. Thanks! [And thanks to 
Daniel Simmons for his piece in the type2_dot_com library 
on using a multimeter!]
