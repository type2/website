I would be willing to bet that 99.9% of the list don't give a rat's ass
about the legalities of CD's etc etc. I sure don't. I belong to many lists,
some of which contain mucho info (check out our motorcycle webpage at
www.XS11_dot_com to see how 450+ members can all contribute and get along).
Let's just get the info back up for us to use. Some of you seem to be
legends in your own minds, when nobody really cares. We use the list
archives to figure out problems, not listen to you guys whine.
