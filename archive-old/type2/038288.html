hey! who said that?!  ;-)
Welding is a great skill to have.  Getting welding done for you isn't the best
way to go...but having a welding job is a great job.  You know why?  Welders get
$20/hr.  Around here they do anyways... What it boils down to is you save
yourself a lot of dough.  Custom work is even more expensive.  I just quoted the
rate for industrial welding...
Welding is actually fun I think...if its done right.  If proper precautions are
not taken...bad things can happen.  Believe me...I've seen most of them.... I
watched people weld in a high school 8)  it can be rather amusing....

Anyways...welding really isn't that hard.  Once you get the hang of it ...you
can only get better.
I would like to invest in a welder...but for now I'll just ask politely and
borrow others...hehe

am rather tired...sorry...I hope  you get what I'm trying to say...
