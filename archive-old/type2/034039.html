Subject: Spirit of Giving

I like the idea of &quot;it is better to give than to receive&quot; that is starting
on the list. I have a 1977 owner's manual and a Westy manual that I have no
use for and hope that someone needs it (maybe their Christmas wish?). Only
requirement is that you pass something else useful on to someone who needs
it.  First come-first served. And a Safe and Happy Holiday season to all you

Don't take life too seriously - you'll never live through it.
