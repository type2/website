Subject: Tuneup Issues

Hi all,
   Yesterday I was doing the usual tune up on the 71
Panel and replaced the points and condensor in the
009, then turned the key like the first bug me video
to do the timing. As soon as I turned the key on and
saw smoke coming from the back. The plastic on the
points, the wire from the points with the push on
connector, and the wire from the condensor connection
to the coil were all fried and melted and stunk up my
garage. The wire from the condensor to the connection
was fine though. What could have caused this? My first
thought was I put it on the wrong terminal on the
coil, but I checked the connections on my extra engine
and the 1600 in my other bus, and they were all the
same. Any help greatly appreciated so I don't do the
same thing when I try again tommorow.
Thanks,
Tyler
