Excellent advice!  Couple trivia points below, but what dave Wrote is
right on!

&gt; Buy a piece of replacement house window glass...cheapest easiest
&gt; size...9X12?  !not plastic!  It needs to be *flat*.

Look for &quot;float glass&quot;.  There are few things short of an optical flat or
a machinist's &quot;surface plate&quot; that are flatter and it's cheap!  Another
alternative, not quite as flat, but less prone to breakage is a
formica-covered sink cutout from a countertop.  I have one that, in
conjunction with a couple sheets of wet/dry sandpaper makes the *best*
knife sharpener!

&gt; Buy some wet/dry 300-400 grit black sandpaper.  Lay the sandpaper on the
&gt; glass, flood it with parts cleaner(non explosive) and start sanding the
&gt; cover plate using even circular motions with an even &quot;all over&quot; pressure.

If you start with 220 then move thru 400 to 600, you will wind up with a
plate that is dead flat, glass-smooth, and leak-free.  300-400 will do the
job, tho, and provides a perfectly acceptable smoothness.

&gt; It doesn't take long....piece of cake.

Amen!  and worth the effort even if it took all day :-)
