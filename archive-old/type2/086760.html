Subject: Re: Exaust Stud removal and other

I should mention that the engine is still in the bus.

&gt; I am going to torch the exaust studs to get them out.  It there anything I
&gt; should be sure to do or not do.  Is mapp or propane going to be enough?
&gt; The weather here is still about 40-50 and they won't budge.
&gt;
&gt; Also what flavor of goup should I use to aid in the sealing of the push
&gt; rod tubes.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
