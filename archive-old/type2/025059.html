Hello Dean and List  STP and oil will run off due to gravity after a time. If 
you use white lit. grease it will stay in place for years. I suppose you 
could also lightly coat the cly. too. I would leave the rockers off so the 
valves would be closed. The only thing to worry about would be mice getting 
in the tin works and making a nest. Mark Dearing Salem Import Service Salem
