&gt; &gt; Oh for the days  of Lafayette Electronics and other stores they ran out of
&gt; &gt; business.

&gt;  My Lafayette integrated amp and tuner still work... ;-(

As do my Heathkit speakers, clocks, weather instruments, tuneup tools, and
digital bathroom scale (way cool in the '70s!).

I too lament the passing of Lafayette, Quement, Heathkit, etc.  All killed
by increasingly cheap surface-mount electronics and automation.  Why spend
$500 for a Heathkit TV when you can get the same thing assembled for $400?
Good for consumers, but bad for gearheads.

What do geek kids do these days?  Video games 24/7?
