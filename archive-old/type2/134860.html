Subject: Re: [T2] Exhaust odor in Bus

From: &quot;Greg Potts&quot; &lt;Greg_at_pottsfamily_dot_ca&gt;
&gt; Have you checked your rear hatch seals lately? If the rear hatch of my bus
&gt; isn't closed firmly and sitting flush to the body, my eyes will be
watering
&gt; in about 5 minutes. The fumes find their way to the front of the bus VERY
&gt; quickly.

You can say that again.  My bay gets nasty after about 5 minutes of driving
with an improperly closed rear hatch.
