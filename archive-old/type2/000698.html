jessica-
you will have to remove that final allen bolt
to get the rotor off. either get a new wrench or grind 1/4&quot;
off  yours ( to sharpen the end ). but if the hole is really
bad, you may want to use the next size up, which is 1/4 &quot;.
if this won't fit, grind it a little and pound it in with a hammer.
you could also heat the bolt red-hot with a torch and lubricate
with penetrating fluid to break the grip of the threads...
you won't be using that bolt again, so you do what you have to .
