Subject: Re: [T2] VWofA hassle;  new aftermarket crankshaft pulley

Saw that pulley.  Intrigued me as to why would that be better than the 
other way.  then i for some reason flashed back to physics and 
remembered that the larger pulley on the primary will increase the rate 
of turn of the secondary but with less power needed at the primary than 
if you shrank the secondary to do the same result.  dont remember the 
fancy equations for it though.

&gt; While browsing VW magazines at the local market I found the following:
&gt;
&gt; The current issue of VW Trends has an interesting editorial about the 
&gt; VWofA hassle.  Written by the same guy that did their interview with 
&gt; VWofA that was published a month or two back.
&gt;
&gt; Same VW Trends has a brief article about a new aftermarket crankshaft 
&gt; pulley for Type 1 engines.  It's intended to speed up the cooling fan.  
&gt; Does so by substantially increasing the size of the crank pulley as 
&gt; opposed to decreasing the size of the generator/alternator pulley.  
&gt; Looks pretty good in the photos, and has degree markings &quot;for accurate 
&gt; timing setting&quot;.
