Subject: Re: CV Joint Life Extension '80

Re axle flipping for more wear on CV joints- I realized this too when
repacking one axle a while back- solution is to flip the entire cv in
place, providing wear on the opposite sides of both the outer ring and next
to axle race. The  cv looks symmetrical except for a groove on outside of
outer ring on one side.  Worked fine for me, and saves removing other axle.
