Subject: Re: [T2] Big clutch nightmare!!

I am assuming you mean the starter spins but does not engage the flywheel?
If yes, are you still using the 72 starter?
If yes, it will not work. You 1st need to try a 76 and up starter. The drive
is longer. Up to the 2.0L, the teeth on the drive are at the sprague
[over-running clutch]. On the 2.0L there is a 1/2&quot; blank space between the
teeth and the sprague. The teeth stick out further. This is also why you
cannot use the SR17X self supporting starter on a 2.0L manual trans, but you
can on the auto trans.
I would try the starter and if it did not fix it, then the other fix would be
a 210 or 215 flywheel.

Subject: [T2] Big clutch nightmare!!


&gt; I just finished installing my rebuilt AVP 2000cc engine in my 72 Westy. On
&gt; the suggestion of GoWesty I went with the bigger clutch AND flywheel, the
&gt; 228mm.
&gt;
&gt; Well now I am trying to start my engine for the first time and the starter
&gt; &quot;fires&quot; but it won't engage or turn the engine. The engine went in fine.
&gt;
&gt; Is this because I have a starter for my 72 (210mm flywheel) and now I have a
&gt; bigger clutch? I sure hope so. Do I have to get a different starter?
&gt;
&gt; The starter doesn't spin freely, but its also not turning the engine. We
&gt; can't seem to turn the engine over with a wrench either!!
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for the help!
&gt;
&gt; Here are some pics I put up now that its in. However I can't get it to
&gt; start:
