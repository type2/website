Subject: RE: [T2] I nominate Clara ... (was FI Update...)

&gt;I nominate Clara for the Most Centered Attitude toward Transporters Award, 
&gt;and I move that the award be made retroactive for the past seven years.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I just wanted to try and explain how it could work or not work...she just 
wanted to give it a good &quot;Clarafaction&quot;. But thanks anyway Clara this thread 
is starting to &quot;suck&quot;.

Later,

Michael Knight
