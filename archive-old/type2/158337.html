&gt; I think it might've been possible to do it the same
&gt; different way in the 1970s as well, if it had been possible -- which
&gt; it wasn't.  Smog and security laws were what broke the Bug's neck,
&gt; both here in Europe and over there in America, not lack of power
&gt; and a five-speed tranny.  IMHO.

&gt; Like the Ford Model T before it, the Beetle sales were slipping because
of competition. In the Model T's case, even the Ford dealers were de-
manding a car that could compete with newer looking models...The
Beetle was competing with Japanese small cars...
