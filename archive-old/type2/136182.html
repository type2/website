Subject: Re: [T2] Hard Starting - Update 2

I've been having the same problem, and the earlier post that suggested the cold start valve might be open all the time hit a nerve.  I've been having hard starting problems in the morning, smelling gas, and getting really lousy gas mileage.
 
Here's my question - when I reconnected the engine, I didn't know which plug went where from the cold start valve, the thermo time switch, or the auxillary air valve.  I broke out the wiring diagrams and took my best guess, and figured I got it right because the engine started.  
 
Now I'm not so sure.  Could these symptoms be explained by having the plugs in the wrong place?
 
Thanks as always.
 
Marc
