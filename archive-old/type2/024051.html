MityVacs are awfully handy diagnostic tools to help gauge overall engine
health and valve problems in particular. Should you also happen to have an old
mercedes with vacuum door locks they are also essential in finding the
inevitable leaks.

Subject: RE: Stumped. Air in brakes


Hi Mark,
I've successfully bled brake that previously had made pulling my hair out.
I tried everything.  I had to break down and buy a MityVac fluid pump.  I
think I paid about $40 for it.  I then pumped the fluid out by suction while
at the same time having someone pump the pedal.  This combination of suction
from the pump and pressure from the pedal finally succeeded in bleeding
those buggers and getting all the air out.  They have bled easily and
normally on that vehicle ever since.  I even managed to unload the MityVac
for close to what I paid for it!

I would suggest trying just about everything else before you get the MityVac
since it is a tool without a whole boatload of uses that still costs more
than dinner.  But it WILL work if all else fails.

Good luck!
