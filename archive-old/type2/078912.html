Subject: Re: [T2] Indigibus!!!

Hello Gail and all, I was there also, the guy who drove the red chevy 
s-10... My wife had the Vanagon, oh well I had a great time anyhow. I 
was only able to stay sat night also as I had to get back to take care 
of chores sunday morning. The phoenix ranch was really nice. We're 
planning going back there some time. We're also looking forward to next 
year. I also need to say thanks for the invite.

&gt; Met a bunch of very nice people.  Took a few pics, which I will take the
&gt; time to review and post
&gt; later.
&gt; Thanks for the invitation, and looking forward to next year.
