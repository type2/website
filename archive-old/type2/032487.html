Howdy Y'all,
I am posting this to both lists because I have a '66 bus with a '71 engine.  My starter\solenoid is letting me down more and more often. When I had to crawl under there and whack the solenoid wearing a shirt and tie the other day, I realized it was probably time to put in a new starter\solenoid.  My question: As stated it's a '66 bus with a 1600 DP engine from a '71.
Which starter should I get? I believe it still has the original 6 volt starter because there is a strange little box\transformer thingy wired in line just before the starter (I'm guessing a voltage drop??) Should I get a 12 volt starter for a '71 or get a new '66 starter and keep the voltage drop thingy there.  If my best bet is to get the '71 starter, could someone give me a quick description of how this should be wired?? 



Peace, John Baker
