Subject: Re: [T2] Pics of the dangers of a front mounted spare

That is not true and you have no evidence to prove what you are saying.

In my OPINION - in my case - the fact that I had a spare on the front of my 
bus made no difference to my safety at all. In my opinion my brakes and my 
bumper stopped me.

I believe, without doing any experiments or being an accident 
reconstructionist, that at up to a certain speed a spare tire on the front 
of your bus is not going to make any difference at all if you are in an 
accident - I believe that in my accident the fact of a spare on the front 
did nothing to save me and my passenger.

I believe that at above another speed a spare tire on the front of your bus 
is not going to make any difference at all - you and your passenger will be 
dead.

I believe that there is a narrow range of speed at which a spare on the 
front of your bus will save your life. I don't know what that range is - and 
I don't think you do. I believe that the range is narrow because up to a 
certain speed it is your bumper that is taking the impact - above a certain 
speed bumper and nose are going to crush - there is just that range at which 
bumper isn't enough but that added thin metal of the nose is enough in 
conjunction with the bumper. But to answer your question;


&gt; My question is after reading two days of doom &amp; gloom regarding a
&gt; frontal impact with a front mounted spare tire on a Type 2 Bus---
&gt;
&gt; What in the hell do you guys think would happen with a direct blast
&gt; without the spare tire mount?

In my case - I think the direct blast without the spare would have resulted 
in the same degree of injury to myself and my passenger (none) and I think 
that without the spare on the front of my bus I would have had a damaged 
bumper to replace and that would have been it.
