Well my bus has been reborn - whoo hooo - i have it saftied, licensed,
insured, registered etc... - and i have it registered as a 1960 and not
as a 1959 (which is what i bought it as) - i just took the idiot manual
into the insurance agent and said here is my VIN (on the safety
inspection paper) here is where it falls in the idiot manual - 1960 -
and if you dont believe me then lets go look at the bus where the date
is stamped - she said: &quot;no prob. its a 60&quot;

yeah, yeah

The new roof looks amazing - ok a little rough but i havent done the
bondo on the seem thing yet - but it sure looks good - no longer caved
in, new supports etc.. man - it is   BEAUTIFUL - and the line of the
roof is perfect - absolutely perfect

So i feel i ought to name it - ive been thinking about Ulyseus or maybe
even Shirley.

Anyway - its been reborn - birth is amazing -

well im loading up my buddy (she is a very cool little black/brown/white
frisbee catching dog) - and we are off for a ride.

JDD 60 standard microbus with a great looking new roof patch
