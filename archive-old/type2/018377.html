&gt; but since (on the T4 engine anyway) when the flaps are closed,
&gt; more air goes to the oil cooler, 

This statement is incorrect.

Having taken out a few Type 4 fan housings, I've studied how the flaps
work.  The right side flap is very straightforward in its operation, it
is either blocking the air passage to the cylinders/heads or is not.

The left side is a bit more complex.  It initially appears that when the
flaps are open, the oil cooler is blocked off.  But clearly this makes
no sense, I think VW is smart enough to realize that when the engine is
hot you need air flow over the oil cooler and when it is cold you
don't.  

So upon closer inspection, you notice that the base of the flap is
mounted inside the fan housing somewhere close to the middle of the air
path.  This allows air to flow over both sides of the flap, not just
over the top as you might think.  The flap on that side is shaped like
an L but rotated 90 degrees clockwise.  When the flaps are &quot;open&quot; (I use
quotes because open and closed aren't really applicable terms when
speaking of the left side flap, unlike the right side flap) the flap
lays down on top of the oil cooler and appears to block flow.  But what
it's really doing is opening up the passage to the cylinders and heads
and sealing the top of the oil cooler so that air flowing up the
underside of the flap is forced through the oil cooler.

When the engine is cold and the flaps are &quot;closed&quot;, the flap raises up
off the oil cooler, breaking the seal and not forcing air through the
oil cooler.  When it is in this raised position it also reduces the size
of the air passage to the cylinders and heads.  It's hard to visualize
if you have not seen the inside of a Type 4 fan housing but with a
little study of it, you will see how it works.
