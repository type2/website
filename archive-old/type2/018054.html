Paul:
The wires don't usually touch the engine case itself, just the sheet
metal. Under normal operation, these areas only get to 200-225F. The
original wires were probably some kind of vinyl insulation, maybe
equivalent to MTW U.S. designations (machine tool wire) and should last
a long time. The big wire from alternator to starter terminal carries
all the output from the alternator which is 12 volts nominal (13.8
actually) but the reason it is so big is that the amperage (volume of
current) is rather large (35-55 amps). Be sure to replace it with
something just as large in cross section of the conductor.
I always use old wires( harnesses salvaged from junked cars) to repair
wiring in VW's just to kep the color codes right. I just splice in a new
section of wire (soldered of course) and use heat shrink tubing over the
splice.
Junk yards are my only source and very often one can find perfect
alternator harnesses. I've seen several failures of the end of this wire
or the other big wire that fastens to the starter lug. (Check its
condition too while you're down there!)
