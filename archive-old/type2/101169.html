&gt; &gt; Let's admit it, Bus Depot has some really
&gt; nifty stuff which you can't get
&gt; &gt; elsewhere. They also have low prices.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; However, there's a question of setting
&gt; expectations.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The fact is that Bus Depot's internet
&gt; ordering system is antiquated by today's
&gt; &gt; standards. 
&gt; 
&gt; yeah but there is a simple solution, call and
&gt; place your order,


Yeah, but notice the word &quot;antiquated&quot;. 

Also, if the phone system is &quot;always&quot; better, why have online ordering?

Why not just remove the online ordering thing and just do everything by phone
or fax( a la bus boys)?

Since BD has a online system, the least that can be done now, is to improve it
by provide accurate information.

This is so that a first time customer like myself (who had been spoiled by
CIP, Amazon etc) would not have unrealistic expectations.

As I said before, customer satisfaction is a question of expectations. If I
know that an item is backordered or special order, I would not expect to get
it fast and would plan for it accordingly and will not whine if I don't get it
after a couple of weeks.

As for the separation between good guys vs also rans, my experience with
restoration parts vendors is that there are 2 camps. One camp takes your order
and doesn't do anything until you call them up 4 weeks later and bitch. Then
you receive it 1 week later. 

The other camp are the warehouse operations where you will only find order
takers and no knowledgeable sales person. On the other hand, the warehouse
operations will ship your item on the same day they receive your order.
