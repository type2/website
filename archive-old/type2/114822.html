Subject: Exhaust - update

Good news! We didn't break any studs! Bad news! I don't have any gaskets...I
pretty much had to stop at that point. Let me ask what all the different
pipes are coming off the motor:

The two that are curved down on each side of the carb?
The two directly below those facing out?
The two facing out that lower than the others above?

Those two holes coming off the fan shroud are covered and I had thought they
were. Also, my muffler has two pieces of tin that it looks like a the fresh
air hose goes into...but, I only have one fresh air duct that hangs directly
off the air cleaner.._dot_can I remove the other tin off the muffler since it
won't be in use?

Scott
