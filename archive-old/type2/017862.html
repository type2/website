&gt; &lt;&lt; if it lights when you use the brakes you have a brake failure, it
&gt;  lights when you press it so you can test to see if its working. &gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; i am assuming he is making a joke right??  you press it, it lights to see if
&gt; its working??  hmmm never heard that one..............made me laff tho.

No joke, on the earlier models you push the lens in as a bulb check. 
Later models, the light comes on as a bulb check when you turn the key
on and it turns off when the engine is started.
