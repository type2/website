&gt; Everthing that was shipped your way from here, was &quot;undercoated&quot; with
&gt; cosmoline, to protect it especially from the salt air in the holds of
&gt; the ships enroute.
&gt; 
&gt; WW II surplus stuff can stll be found, covered with the same coating
&gt; applied 50 some years ago.

and as a veteran I can tell you that stuff is the most disgusting stuff I
have ever had to deal with, it never really dries and it can be scraped
away very easily.  great for shipping but I sure wouldn't want it on my
bus

&gt; Enough said?

more than enough said,  yuck!
