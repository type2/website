Subject: Re: [T2] CR question

Since the spec when new was 7.3:1 that doesn't seem too far off.  It sound
like each step up in shim height is knocking you down about .13 - .14 in CR
so going to .020 shims would put you slightly below original spec.

Subject: [T2] CR question


&gt; Cc'd my heads, measured deck height; came up with a compression ratio
&gt; of 7.36:1 if I use the .010 shims that came with the gasket set.
&gt;
&gt; Bob Hoover seems to like a 7.5:1 CR, Dale Mueller and Ron van Ness like
&gt; 7:1.
&gt;
&gt; An 0.30 shim would give me 7.08, and an .040 would down tune me to
&gt; 6.95:1.
&gt;
&gt; Opinions? Given that I want long engine life, should I order thicker
&gt; shims? Or is 7:36:1 a good number (with regular gas)?
