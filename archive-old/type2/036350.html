Jack, 

Sorry to hear the tale of woe :-( I would not be too pessimistic on the
trans, tho...  Todd went down in flames for financial reasons, not
incompetence.  His mechanical rep was always very good on the list, so I
will bet the problem is not in the trans.  A binding shift rod may be the
cause, but also the shift plate, which was lined up for the old trans may
be out of place for the new one.  Don't give up!  All is not yet lost!

Given that we are talking a T1 engine bus, I would say throw the engine
in, see if that cures it.  If it does not (and it may well not), then
loosen the plate at the bottom of the shift lever and play with it a bit.  
I say this despite my personal *terrible* luck at adjusting that puppy :-(
Write Sean Bartnik.. he is in the area and we did adjust his plate to the
point where he now has 4 gears, after much travail.  

Also, you *do* have trans fluid in the new trans, right?  He may have
shipped it dry, many shippers require that.
