&gt; Subject: [KG] Parts Bonanza - AJ's Auto Repair Closing
&gt; 
&gt; AJ's got a 30 day notice to vacate the premises. Not because he was late
&gt; on
&gt; the payments or destroying the property, but because they want to put up
&gt; housing and a park on the property where AJ's Auto and the SaddleRack are.
&gt; 
&gt; AJ's must vacate by 7/31/2001. AJ's is located at:
&gt; 
&gt; AJs Auto Repair
&gt; 404 Meridian Avenue
&gt; San Jose, CA 95126
&gt; 408.292.8043 (if you call, ask for John)
&gt; 
&gt; They will be selling everything that can be moved. This includes:
&gt; 
&gt; Bugs (60-75) : whole or part 
&gt; Buses (68 &amp; up) : Whole or part
&gt; Karmann Ghia coupe(72)
&gt; Buildable Engines (single &amp; dual)
&gt; engine tin
&gt; heater boxes
&gt; tires,
&gt; bug: fenders, hoods, window glass, windshield glass, door handles, bumpers
&gt; (some nos)
&gt; Engine stands
&gt; carbs
&gt; heads,
&gt; taillight lenses (bug/bus)
&gt; Headlight assemblies (early/late bug, bus)
&gt; 
&gt; VW parts accumulated while in business on site for the last 40 years.
&gt; 
&gt; They won't be shipping parts. Please drive over. Will probably be having
&gt; weekend yard-type sales starting 7/14/2001 at the garage. 
&gt; 
&gt; Whole cars will be pretty cheap $50 - $300.
