Hi Chris, check out the Bob Hoover sermons available on the net. He 
gives good info on this conversion and the requirements. I am 
considering it myself.  

One thing, in the sermons written over a year ago, he mentioned Bergman 
as a source for this. I recall a message from Bob on the list a few 
months ago where he no longer recommends Bergman. I don't recall the 
reason. I asked him in a message recently and he suggested checking 
Rimco, has a small add in Hot VW, as a good source for this.

&gt; I am getting ready to split the case to build a new bottom end
&gt; for the '71 Bus, (possibly the '72 fastback, whichever needs
&gt; it first, both are begging...) and am considering the
&gt; Bernie Bergman $219 special that I see in the 'Dumb Blonds
&gt; and Hyped VWs' rag.
&gt; 
&gt; If you are not familiar with it, heres the poop: Clean, line
&gt; bore (DOnt start with this thread, please.), case savers,
&gt; deep stud, machine in lifters and a bunch of new oil galleys,
&gt; special cam, pushrods, springs, lifters, open for 90.5 pistons,
&gt; full flow machining, and some other stuff. Total of about $250
&gt; for the extra work (90.5s, full flow) I will be asking around
&gt; about the costs locally, but I expect them to be high, everything
&gt; is expensive in the Metro DC area.
&gt; 
&gt; I am also waffling on 'needing' the hydraulic lifters. I have never
&gt; had a lifter fail from the solid style, and have never noticed a problem,
&gt; and I am not adverse to setting the gap 3-4 times a year with the oil
&gt; change.
&gt; 
&gt; Do I really buy more reliability? Better running at all temp. ranges?
&gt; Quieter? Is it more persnickity about oil? I figure it is prob.
&gt; about a $100 up-charge over the normal case cleaning and machining,
&gt; so, bottom line, is it worth it?
&gt; 
&gt; 25 years with solid lifters, do I REALLY need them now?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanx.
