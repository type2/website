Subject: [T2] Re: Running on Three

&gt;I just submitted an E mail titled Flashing Oil Light/ Hesitation/ yikes 
&gt;And I then went out to the bus and started it up and pulled the wires off 
&gt;one at a time.  I'm running on three cylinders. #4 is out of commision. I 
&gt;replaced the plug and the wire with no difference. Is this a stuck valve?
&gt;The compression is o.k. at 100 in high altitude on that cylinder same as 
&gt;the others. What's the story.

Unlikely to be a stuck valve, as that should give zero compression (been
there, done that).  Unfortunately I'm not experienced enough to tell you
what it *is*.  Sorry.
