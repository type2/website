&gt; Why not?  I think they call it sharing ideas!  Isn't that what this list is
&gt; all about? Sharing ideas, and helping others with knowledge/power. Oh, sorry
&gt; maybe someone out there has a patent on wrenching.

If you kick the guy in the nuts really hard, he might decide his cat really
prefers to remain in the bag.

Patent on wrenching? With all these high-tech patents being approved today,
you could probably get a patent on wrenching.
