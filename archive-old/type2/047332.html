Subject: Re: [T2] 1974 VW Safari engine questions/ Auto Tranny rebuildquestions

I've found the auto transmissions as easy or easier to rebuild than the engine.  Any special tools you need to buy or rent will still get you in under an outside rebuilder.

&gt; Why would the stock 1973, dual carbed beast be automatic?? The transmission is still original. Never been redone. Which is actually the next question.....Who does the list recommend for transmission rebuilding?? Do the large transmission chains, such as AAMCO do a good job on aircooled vehicles?? Anybody had any experiences with them??
