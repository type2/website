Subject: Re: [T2] Painting rims

Locally I can get 16 rims powdercoated for $40, sandblasting done by a 
local monument company for cheap. $75 for all the rims you and 2 friends 
can deliver. That's how we did it.


&gt;I have a set of rims that I hot tanked all the grime off of.  Now for 
&gt;painting, does anyone have a suggestion for the type of paint to use that 
&gt;will  last?  I prefer using rattle cans,  No sprayer is currently 
&gt;available, but I might be able to borrow a friends.  Also I don't care for 
&gt;comments on wasting my time with painting when I should have them powder 
&gt;coated.  The $60 per rim is more than I can afford right now.
