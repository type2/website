Subject: Re: [T2] Adventurewagen pictures!

We bought it, and
&gt;are looking forward to many future two-human, four-dog adventures. I call
&gt;her 'Bertha' (and a Grateful Dead sticker will soon appear on one of the
&gt;back windows!)

Congrats. As I said before I really think you are better off with an 
aircooled Vanagon as compared to a water box.

I often name my VWs after dead songs and I usually find a steal your face to 
slap on them.

The pics didn't work all i got was image hosted by Tripod.
