Subject: Re: [T2] STARTER WOES

well.
i would advise a little thoughtful troubleshooting before wiring in a
hot-start relay or replacing the starter.

check the wiring, connections and keyswitch.
a voltmeter is useful.
if you isolate it to suspect the starter/solenoid. you might pull the
starter and clean and lube it up and try again.
Intermittent starters like that Ive often found to be the starter itself
and it is an easy job and not terribly expensive.


did you read seans troubleshooting article?
