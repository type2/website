&gt; There are several ways to go when the threads are gone.
&gt; 1. If you manage to get the old stud out without big damage to the 8mm
&gt; threads just put in a new stud, clean the threads. Mabye a longer
stud if
&gt; the hole is deep enough.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. Next step is Helicoil, a type of insert threads. These can be a
little
&gt; hard to put in with the engine in the bus.

I'd change this to &quot;next to impossible!&quot;

&gt; 3. Have someone who is handy with a lathe make you studs that are
10mm in
&gt; one end and 8mm in the other. Then drill larger holes in the heads
and tap
&gt; them to 10mm.

You don't have to make them, stepped studs are a fairly standard part.
 You still have the problem of drilling and tapping the holes that you
would have with the heli-coil.
 
Another route is to find someone with an EDM (Electrical Discharge
Machining) machine.  This gadget eats the metal out electrically and
can even cut through a stuck tap or EZout, leaving the original
threads intact.

Problems like this are the reason that I advocate using copious
quantities of penetrating oil for several days before you try to
remove exhaust nuts.  Use the correct exhaust nuts when reassembling
and put a dollop of anti-sieze on the threads.
