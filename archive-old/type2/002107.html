Hi all I just had a safelite windshield installed.  It is great insurance
covered it so it was free.    I went ahead and had the old one removed and did
some por 15 painting before they showed up.  It hadn't rained here in a couple
weeks and their was water under the seal.  A safelite seal from less than a
year ago.  No holes but I went ahead and redid paint just to make sure.

I wasn't here during the install but my (ex now) girlfriend said it took him
15 minutes by himself including washing the window and picking up his stuff.
Ok how do they install them by them solo.  I helped install a friends and it
took both of us and we still cracked it more.  It already had a small crack
from when he was putting on the seal.

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
Snoopy
