&gt; What a project!

&gt; Biodiesel sounds good, but I bet you need reasonably good social skills
&gt; (which I lack) to acquire the fuel.

Biodiesel is actually a wide spectrum of concepts.  It can be anything
from &quot;used french fry oil&quot; to &quot;corn oil produced specifically for
fuel&quot;.

The problem with the used french fry oil concept is that it works fine
when you are the only person who is using it.  Even minimal social skills
will convince a restaurant owner to give you something that they
normally have to pay to have hauled away.  Change the equation to a dozen
people vying for the oil and it suddenly becomes a valuable commodity
that will cost you dearly.
