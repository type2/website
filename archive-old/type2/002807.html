I had the very same problem for years. If i tried to put more than half
atank of gas in, them smell got really strong. Further investigation found
the 90 degree rubber vent pipe on top of the tank persised. Engine out, fire
wall of and replaced, now fine... and full tanks.
There is info somewhere on the net about doing this job with engine in... a
bit tricky i think.

&gt; I have a 72 bus which is in pretty mint condition.  One problem is I smell
&gt; gas fumes inside the bus.  I'm pretty sure its my gas tank or the over
flow
&gt; tank because I smell it the worst on a full tank.  How can I fix this?
I'm
&gt; pretty sure its not the exhaust eventhough the fumes come out of the
heater
&gt; vents.   Thank You
&gt;
