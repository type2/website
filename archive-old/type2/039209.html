Subject: O2 Sensor on '78 Westy

Volks...  Have a question for you folks with FI 2.0 engines.  Where does the 
wire go from the O2 sensor?  Richard Millar is touring the US in a '78 Westy 
with FI.  The O2 sensor is not connected to anything.  How important is it to 
have it connected, where is it connected, and how do you test for it being 
good?  As I run a dual carb engine, I ain't no help....  all you folks that 
have assembled FI engines got a routing for Richard in wiring his O2 sensor 
back up, if it is needed for proper operation of his engine.
Richard isn't on the Type 2 list, so please reply to him at.....

rsmillar_at_hotmail_dot_com

and to the Type 2 list as well so the info gets into the archives...
