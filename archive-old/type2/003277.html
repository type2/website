The doing it I think is easy.  The only thing a simple upright needs is 12V
to the coil and a gas hose &amp; throttle cable to the carb.  The input shaft of
the transmission would need to be shortened (grind off).  However, there is
something to the pancake's transmission (final drive ratio) that makes the
upright work harder and not get as much cooling RPM, so be sure to either
monitor your oil temp or install an external cooler.  And while you're at it
put in an oil filter - the 1600 is going to need all it can get in order to
provide up to what I hear 60,000 miles of service in a bus (maybe less in a
camper).  Also, the tin you'd need is sold through Bus Depot from some UK
company where upright engines were an option from 1972-79, costs $250 but
didn't exactly fill the hole.  I bought a 79 Westy with a 1600 upright in
it, I rebuilt the engine and tuned it up.  It performs well and gets around
20 mpg but I don't drive it on hot trips because I don't think it could go
65mph for long without the temperature becoming destructive.  It doesn't
have an external cooler yet.

p.s. Be sure to consider the advise on rebuilding the pancake!  That is what
I'd do.
