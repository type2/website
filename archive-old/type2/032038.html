Hi
THanks for all the replies to my whats wrong now question. You've all
convinced me to bite the bullet and fix it now.  The poor engine will
finally rest.  I was and still am apprehensive about doing this since I
have very little VW experience until 2 months ago and have never removed
an engine of any kind from anything larger than the deck of a lawnmower.
You will all be glad to hear I am pulling the engine today and my rebuilt
AVP left side head will be here tomorrow. I need to pull both heads
to get those broken studs out of the right side head but it had 120
compression all around so I am not replacing it.  I bought a half a set of
rings from the local foreign auto parts store and am ready to get busy.
Its a 79 type IV and I am planning to use Sean Bartniks &quot;Engine and
Transmission removal&quot; article from the library but I figure I actually
won't need to even seperate the engine and tranny as I am just removing
heads and cylinders on one side.

Am I wrong?  Will this work as well as it sounds like it will?

TIA

Dan Sweet
