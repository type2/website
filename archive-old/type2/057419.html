Update:

Thanks to everyone who took time to reply - I'm working my way through your
ideas now!

Lots of folks pointed out that I should test my compression, I have cycled all
over the shop in the last two days to find one suitable, and I have just
bought one tonight, so I will try in the morning.... but more developments.

Thanks to Robert Stuart and Hannah who told me to check my &quot;new tinware&quot; sure
enough I had moved a fuel line out of the way and partly unscrewed the brass
pipe coming out of the pump and I was loosing fuel, sadly that did not cure
the problem.

The last thing I did today was check the points again (2nd set in 4 days
remember) that are wrecked again, all I can think of (and the mechanic I rang)
was that the old coil was bad and wrecked both the new points and new
condenser, so now I am going to try another condenser and points... any
thoughts... To me this says that it MUST be an ignition problem, what? is the
question.

On a side note, I got my brother to run me around looking for a condenser and
points.  Points .. no problem, Condenser - can't find even LUCAS (they make
them) didn't have one (They can all get me one tomorrow).  The Lucas guy said
all the condensers were the same, just in different cases with different
leads???, I am off to the archives to see if this one has popped up before..

Thanks for now...Kepp the ideas coming in
