Subject: Re: Spark Plug Boots-sealing

I too was dissatisfied with the way the don't fit on the type4
 engine- I used silicone all around the seal and over its top, making
sure there was a coating of oil on the tin.  Next bootpull time, it
comes off easily but returns with just the right shape to seal the hole.
To keep it under tension, slide the boot towards the tip a bit before
returning it to the plug.
