Subject: high oil usage

Last year, I bought a '71 Westy with a 1776 engine / dual Kadrons.  I had
to remove  the engine because of one lousy muffler stud problem and I took
the opportunity to rebuild it - didn't split the case but replaced pistons
/ cylinders / heads and almost everything else.  I chose Berg heads with
the semi-hemi cut.  I also installed the complete cooling system  - new
thermostat and working fins.

The PO had installed a mysterious liter bottle whose input hose came from
the oil filler neck and whose output led to one of the Kadrons.  It was
clearly a home-made oil recovery system.  I did not reinstall it.

After driving about a thousand miles,  I have a problem.  I use a quart of
oil in 100 miles.

 I have not checked the compression and do not know if the rings are OK
because in the past new Ps/Cs and rings have always provided a nice tight
engine.

Can anyone suggest a relationship between the oil recovery bottle and this
oil use problem?  Is there something about a 1776 that leads to this?

As an aside,  I have a thermocouple embedded in the oil filler tube and was
getting readings of 250F on a trip in 88 degree weather last week.

Thanks, Jack
