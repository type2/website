Subject: Gen Light On ('71)
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.SOL.3.95.981201084627.21991A-100000_at_mallard2&gt;

On the way into work today, the Generator light came on and stayed on.  
Immediately, I pulled over and checked the fan belt...it's there and
spinning fine.   
Here's the clue that I will investigate over lunch (sure beats eating):
my turn signals no longer function and when I try to use them the gen
light doubles in brightness from normal red to bright red.

Has anyone had this happen?  Can I pull the fuse for the turn signals and
drive to a more convenient tinkering space.  I knew my luck was soon to
run out, as I had almost gone 100 miles without an unscheduled technical
mishap. Hopefully I can fix this one without the wife ever knowing of it,
as I think she is beginning to question my irrational attachment to this
dual source of joy and pain.  I'm not a fanatic, really.

 Later,
Greg
