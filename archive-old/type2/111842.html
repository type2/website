Hey there,

I've never had to repair windshield rust, but I will have to attend to it on my
bus at some point.

Here's a &quot;bunch-o-links&quot; that gives a good overview of the process.

You'll find a lot of stuff written on this topic in the type2_dot_com archives as
it is a common problem on our old buses :(

Hope this helps,
