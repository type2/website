Subject: 1970 owners manual help please.

I was showing my 19 yr. old stepdaughter that the oils has to be changed 
everything 3000 miles and lo and behold the oil change page in the 1970 owners 
manual was missing.
Anyone have a scan on the oil change page and the reverse or does anyone have 
a reasonable 1970 owners manual they would part with?  (with which they want 
to part?!)

BTW how many of you check and clean the gasoline filter in the fuel pump 
every 6000 miles?
TIA
