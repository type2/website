Subject: Re: [T2] RE: source needed for auto carpet

Check you local carpet suppliers or any local fabric stores. Both have 
carpet suitable for campers and vans here in small town TN.

Try to buy reminants (pieces left over from an install job). These are 
cheap and usually come in sizes big enough to do a VW just fine. Be sure to 
have the edges bound so they don't unravel.

&gt;I have seen Porsche Black auto carpet on rolls by the yard at Menards
&gt;at a very good price, I don't remember the price but thought it wasn't
&gt;very expensive especially since the word Porsche was in front of it.

I live in a small town of 20K people and could name 4 carpet stores, and 3 
fabric stores in town or nearby that would/could have what you need.
