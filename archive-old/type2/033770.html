check to make sure all the connections in back sending the heat to the front 
are secure.  That the fresh air tube on that side is nice.  The bit that 
sends it by the muffler ditto.    Also that the heater box is all the way 
activated by the cable, or tied all the way open if the cable is dead.    if 
all that is fine, do you have a big rust hole in the heat tube to the front?

get the heat up front through the usual channels, also nice for defogging
