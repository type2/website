Here are a few comments regarding the carpet padding/sound proofing thread.
With noise, you either have to block it, absorb it, or reduce it at the
source.

To reduce &quot;structural borne&quot; noise use damping material. Cheap stuff is
asphalitic in nature, and more expensive solutions can be had such as Q-pads
and Dynamat. Damping material will reduce vibrations, and block some noise
from being transmitted. In a bus this will work best at the engine
compartment,
and wheel wells. Visco-elastic material (Q-pads, dense neoprene) has the
added
effect of absorbing some of the vibration energy that would normally go into
vibrating the metal panels.

Door panels on a bus are another spot to use damping material if you want to
reduce the &quot;drumming sound&quot; or have your door sound like a Lexus when it
shuts
instead of an oil can.

OPEN celled foam is good for absorbing &quot;airborne sound&quot; (not vibrations).
As noted, it has the disadvantage of absorbing moisture. Still it is a good
thing to use in all the side panels and doors. VW used fiberglass.

The basic question you have to answer for yourself is how much weight do
you want to add, and how much money do you want to spend.

In my Westy, I use a mixture of stuff discarded from acoustic tests I have 
done in the past. Basically, I have damping material between the engine and
the interior of my bus. This is a self-adhesive foam with a soft aluminum
constraining layer. I also use a thinner version on all my door and side
panels. For sound absorbtion I use either mylar backed urethane foam with
self adhesive or insulation blankets that are layered fiberglass and
open celled foam. I also, use rubber undercoating for the wheel wells.

I don't recommend that anyone spend the money to buy the stuff I used,
but you may want to check out the following web sites for more info.
