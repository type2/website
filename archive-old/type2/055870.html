Subject: Successful loaf tow *using Beetle tow bar*
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

I wanted to thank all the folks who wrote in with advice on my 
question about towing a breadloaf.  For those of you who missed it, 
the advice fell into the following 4 categories:

1. Put in on a trailer or you face disaster.

2. Keep all four wheels on the ground or you face disaster.

3. You can tow it on a two-wheel dolly, but it must be backwards or 
you face disaster.

4. You can tow it on a two-wheel dolly, but if it's backwards you 
face disaster.

Well, I was planning to go with #4 but as it's the end of the 
semester in this University town, none were to be had during my 
window of Maximum Free Helpers.

So I got to thinking.  Beetle tow bars don't work on busses due to 
the reach involved (and torsion tube diameter?).  I was wishing my 
bus had a nice tubular front bumper that a beetle tow bar would fit 
on.  So I made one:

Two pieces of angle iron or the like (I used 2x3&quot; aluminum box 
'girders') about 18&quot; long, bolted to the front bumper mounting holes 
in the frame.  (You gotta remove the front bumper.)  The metal pieces 
stick out just far enough to clamp my 3' , thick-wall, 2&quot; ID cheater 
pipe to them with some U-bolts.  So you've got a rig that looks sort 
of like a push-bar on a dragster.  The Beetle tow bar clips onto this 
and due to the space between the angle iron, it can't slide off 
either end.

We used this contraption to tow my $200 71 westy about 45 miles, 
doing around 35-45 the whole way, with no problems.  We 
would have gone faster but I was concerned about the running gear on 
the bus -- not the tow rig.  (No probs there - the right rear 
hubcap was hot to the touch at one pullover/checkit stop, but not 
really bad.)  The bus tracked very well the whole trip.  It's now 
resting comfortably in a barn in South Georgia, waiting for my 
ministrations.

SO I'm wondering if I should patent the &quot;adaptabars&quot; ;-).   Total 
cost was about $20 (for hardware and BIG drill bits), but I did have 
the bars and pipe already.

YMMV,
Joe
