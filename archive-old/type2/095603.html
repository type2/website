Subject: Ron out thru Mon- Anyone going to Grassroots Fest in NY?

Email sent to me personally (ron_at_busdepot_dot_com) will probably go unread until
Monday, as we (myself, my wife Evon, and 4-year-old Haley) are on our way to
the Grassroots Festival of Music and Dance near Ithaca, NY.  I'm bringing a
laptop with internet access (via cell phone) but will be trying hard not to
use it, lest I suffer the wrath of an angry wife who thinks I need a
vacation. :-)

It's business as usual at the shop, however, so email sent there
(sales_at_busdepot_dot_com) will be read as usual, and orders will ship as usual.

Anyone going to the festival?  If so, look for us and stop by for a cold
beer. We'll have a circle of Westies with side tents, in the main (on-site)
vehicle camping area.  Mine's a blue '89 Vanagon with a BUSDEPO vanity
license plate.  Incidentally, if you're not planning on going, you should
be.  It's a lot of fun for people of all ages; an eclectic combination of
all kinds of music, crafts, exotic food, and more. Good people, too. Website
is http://www.grassrootsfestival_dot_org/ .
