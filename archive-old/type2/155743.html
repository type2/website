Subject: Re: [T2] Yet another Not-a-new-bus

&gt;


I think they got infected with Chrysler-itis.

I know people that have never driven anything but a M-B all their lives and
refuse to purchase a new one. Said they're junk and won't last like they
used to. Remember that these are people who buy new cars every 3 years.
