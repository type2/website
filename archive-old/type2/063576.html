Subject: Are original Westy curtains worth any $?

hey now,

amanda and i are going to replace the original orangish/yellowish ucky
curtains in our orange '77 westy with some heavy duty thick insulated
curtains. i've found that this helps keep in the heat when camping in winter.
i'm sure someone out there would want these curtains and i really don't want
to throw them away. i also need a few extra $$'s. i don't want to rip anyone
off and i was wondering if these have any value or should i just give them
away? now, i know what the answer is going to be! :-)

btw, what is the best color for curtains in regards to keeping cool in the
summer and warm in the winter?? we have a couple rolls of this killer black
matterial with gold suns and moons and stars. would black be too hot in the
summer?

thanks,

jonathan
