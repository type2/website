Subject: Re: [T2] Spark Plugs Bosch vs NGK

Forget this info TIm--

Remember the Benz engineer's say this plug isn't recommended and doesn't
work.

( Who said that anyway ?)

I suppose if in fact a guy was going to leave them plugs in his engine
for that long of a duration--anti seize would be a good thing to be
thinking about--

And if a guy was to leave his plugs in his engine for half that time,
anti seize would still be a good thing to consider--

Or is this a bad idea too ??


E-mail message

I asked before and no one answered so I'll ask again. Which
  manufactures have designed an ignition system that calls for
platinum Bosch, or any
    other brand platinum, as factory stock????
Mercedes-Benz: 98 and up 112 [V6] and 113 [V8], factory Bosch Platinum
with 100,000 mile lifespan.
One question, Karl. Do they suggest that the plugs be pulled from time
to time to prevent seizure of the threads, or just wait till 100,000 and
break the plug off trying to get it out???
