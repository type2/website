Subject: A couple o' questions (66 Westy)

Hello all, my first post to the NEW list.
        1: I was looking at wiper blades in the RMMW catalog and I see
that they have &quot;suspended&quot; and &quot;unsuspended&quot; blades available.  What is
the difference and which do I need?
        2: I need one new headlight assembly (i.e. glass lens, bucket
thing, etc.) can I use a beetle one or does anyone have a spare one for
sale?
        3: I found one funky looking window crank (looks like a Viking
helmet) for the jalousy windows but it seems to be stripped.  Is this
original?  Where can I get something that will work?  What do the rest of
you use?
        4: I'm replacing some brake lines along with the master cylinder
and the whole brake system is dry.  How much brake fluid is needed for the
whole system?

Actually, it's more than a couple of questions and I'm sure I have more
but answer what you can and I thank you in advance.  In case you forgot,
these refer to a 1966 Westfalia, completely original.

Thanks,
- -Erik.
