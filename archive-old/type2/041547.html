a Berg 5 is at LEAST $1400 more than a 4 speed, so know that making your
decision.

&gt; Dear List:
&gt;
&gt; After 10 years on relatively trouble free ownership of my bus ('79 westy)
&gt; I'm in the midst of the year from hell.  After just getting my engine back
&gt; in following an uexpected rebuild, I was performing routine maintenance
&gt; tonight such as changing the tranny fluid and repacking CVs in preparation
&gt; for a long camping trip starting Thursday.  When I drained the
transmission
&gt; oil, the magnetic plug came out carrying chunks from what appears to be a
&gt; roller bearing.  Now this thing is working fine, but finding rollers in
the
&gt; oil makes me think I'll be sleeping in a tent this weekend with the westy
&gt; sitting at home.
&gt;
&gt; So what is the list wisdom regarding tranny rebuilders?  I'm in Indiana
and
&gt; there is nobody that I know of locally that I would trust to do this.
I've
&gt; heard about the 5-speed tranny that the Gene Berg folks build.  Has anyone
&gt; done this? and with what kind of results?  Were modifications required?
&gt; etc. etc. etc.
