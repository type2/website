Subject: Re: [T2] South wind gas heater

This must be a military heater, I've not seen one of these up close.  I
would think you must still cut holes for the exhaust and intake air, they
should come up from the bottom.

I do carry South Wind heater parts for the VW South Winds, not sure if I
would have any parts for these, I would have to see inside the box.

&gt; has anyone had any expirience with these heaters.  is
&gt; seems like installation would be very simple, becuase there are no seemingly
&gt; no safety switches or much of a wiring harness.
