ZR72:

The late model Brazilian Bugs came with dual carbs from the factory.  You
could order the car (as of 1993) to run on gas or alcohol.  As for getting
a set here in the U.S. nobody seems to be importing them.  Hot VWs did a
feature on these cars back in 1993.  (can't remember what issue)

Thank you!

&gt; Date: Thursday, May 13, 1999 7:25 PM
&gt; 
&gt; while doing some surfing a few days ago i came across a web site that had
a 
&gt; bunch of neat stuff from brazil i believe for 1600 bugs and buses.  i
forgot 
&gt; to mark the site and am wondering if anyone knows to what i refer.??
&gt; 
&gt; one of the things was a set of dual solex carbs with proper engine tin
with 
&gt; preheat hoses and everything. stock air cleaners to go with it.  does
anyone, 
&gt; possibly ron (bus depot ) know how to get any of  this stuff.  i
personally 
&gt; would love to put on a complete set of stock factory dual carbs for both
my 
&gt; early bus and my b*g.  they had a bunch more funky stuff i liked but
thats 
&gt; another story.
&gt; 
&gt; any help would be appreciated.
