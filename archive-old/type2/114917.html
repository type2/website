Subject: RE: [T2] Driving

'&quot;Anyhoo, driving a bus is cool.  Face it.&quot; - AMEN SISTER!!!


Last night I was attempting to replace a blown rear break cylinder on my '94
Park Avenue with anti-locks.
I loathe when  automobile manufactures create a unique &quot;bolt&quot; that requires
a special tool just to remove / replace something that normally needs to be
replaced under standard  usage.    After removing wheel, drum, and  pads
(held in place with the most god-awful spring), I found I didn't have the
male  hex stud remover required .... Grrrrrr....

The drive to the parts store in Maynard, my '78 westy was calming and
spiritually cleansing.   The Buick pissed on my chi, and Maynard was happy
to restore balance...

 You got to love the smiles of people around you as they pass... old, young,
everyone..smiling, pointing, thumbs up..
.
There's a beauty and elegance in simplicity.
