&gt; Did VW ever produce bays with one-piece middle windows like the passenger

all the openings are the same size so use the glass from a rear side
window that doesn't open in the middle.

&gt; 
&gt; Anyone?
&gt; 
&gt; I am looking to replace the middle windows in my '77 - 7 passenger
&gt; (currently with stock vent windows) to one-piece to clean up the appearance
&gt; (mild custom)...any leads would be appreciated.
