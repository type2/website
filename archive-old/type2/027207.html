Hi Steve,
  Years ago I had a 80 Van-O-Gone... the thing was a chronic oil dripper from
the tubes.... I cant count how many times I replaced the seals... looking back
with the info gleaned from the list I would polish up the seats and the ends of the
tubes on my next replacement of the seals and see if that helped the longevity.
Good luck.....
---My 1980 air-cooled vanagon has excessive (1 quart in 500 miles) oil 
---leak.  I have removed the cooling tin from the bottom of the motor and

---after wiping down the drips and running in place for 30 minutes, it 
---appears that the oil is leaking from the push rod tubes ---SNIP---
