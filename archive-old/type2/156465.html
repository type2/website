Subject: Re: [T2]fri - Where are all the busses?

I must be lucky.  I see them just about every day here in  Chattanooga.   Very active local club, also.  Their  newsletter last month had 3 virtually identical Sage Green westies  lined up overlooking the mountains.  They put mine to shame, I'm  afraid.  Got to get to sanding.  Cheers....KR

&gt; Since driving my bus for about 2 months now, I've come to the conclusion

&gt;
&gt; But I've only seen 1 other bus on the road.  It's a powder-blue bus with
&gt; a white top, and seems to be in really good shape.  There's  1 or 2

&gt; Am I just in a void of busses?

no don't think so, I live in Baltimore and there are maybe 4-5 buses left
on the road here and while their not all on the list, I know everyone by
sight if not by name......  a new or different one gets a double take to
see if I recognize someone... and most folks just aren't driving them
anymore on a daily basis,. was a couple years ago that I stopped seeing
the last regularly driven splitty I guess the bays are getting to be &quot;no
longer transport but now toys&quot;    still a few of us iconoclasts around
that use em for daily drivers, but even I have stopped taking mine on long
drives much anymore, not because I don't want to but when the bus gets
18mpg and my wifes little S*turn gets 34mpg well it becomes economics.

see you on the road
