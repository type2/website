Subject: Re: [T2] Sound deadening...

&gt; The mattress in the back of the westy goes a long way to reducing 
&gt; some of the engine noise but like others say the tire and wind noise 
&gt; is what's loudest. 

I was really pleased when I replaced the tires that were on my Westy when I bought it, the new ones are dramatically quieter even with a truck tread.

I think I might see an improvement with new seals all the way around my pop-top.

I wish I had recorded the SPL of my bus when I bought it to track changes, I need to do it now, I am thinking put the meter in a particular spot, drive a particular stretch of road and a particular speed and then measure changes.
