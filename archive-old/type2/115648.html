Subject: Re: [T2] Oil pump questions

&gt; List,
&gt; I purchased a new Melling oil pump with 30mm
&gt; gears.  
&gt; Don't know if it is supposed to be high output or stock.

this is a high output pump. stock has 26mm gears.

the melling pumps are known to leak. you are better off with a schadek 30mm
type 1 pump. aircooled_dot_net sell them already blueprinted.

&gt; What do people mean by 'Blueprinting&quot; the oil pump?  Is this something I
&gt; need to do to the new pump?

a new pump can be blueprinted. get a copy of the book &quot;how to hotrod VW
engines&quot;, there is a section on how to do it.

&gt; My old pump had scoring in the chambers and .006&quot;
&gt; clearance on the gears and sidewall, and maybe .002&quot; clearance on the cover
&gt; plate: worn out junk-yes?
&gt; Is it possible to use a Type 1 oil pump?

yes. if you have a melling it is a type 1 pump.

&gt; I read some articles about this
&gt; but it didn't sound like a great idea to me.

right. the reason people do it is because there is only one size of pump
available for type IV motors - 26mm. so if you want a higher capacity pump,
you have to go to a type 1 unit. plus the stock t4 oil pumps cost 3x what a
good 30mm schadek aluminum type 1 pump costs.

&gt; Last question:  My old pump had an &quot;o-ring&quot; to seal the cover plate and
&gt; the new pump has a paper-type gasket.  The paper gasket is the correct seal
&gt; right?

yes. another reason why the stock t4 pump is a good idea. - they have a
better sealing system and are much less prone to leaking. type 1 pumps are
leakers almost by design. but if you assemble things really well, they won't
leak.

the other thing about the type 1 pump is that there may be a clearance
problem with the cam, depending on what kind of cam you are using - if it
has a bolt-on gear you may need to clearance the pump body. the pump cover
also may need clearancing to fit on the case - it can interfere with one of
the fan shroud mounting bosses.
