Subject: suggested engine break-in regimen--comments?

Hi, folks--

I now own a new VW de Mexico engine, not yet installed.  The guy at the
counter gave me a four-page photocopied set of dos and don'ts that they
normally distribute to people who buy the rebuilts they sell--not a shop
guide, basically how to install and break in the thing without voiding the
warranty. Some other company had written the document and this place
inserted its name at the appropriate points with correction fluid and a
pen, so the original source of this document is unknown [but possibly it's
a rebuild place in California called S.I.R.--don't remember what the
initials stand for].

There's a lot in those 4 pages I'll skip over now, to get to this part
[though if anyone wants to see the whole thing I can send them a copy].  
I'm particularly curious for any comments about the &quot;20 mph to 55 mph&quot;
part, which I'd never heard before:

-[begin quote from instructions]-

Immediately after your installation is complete, and you have read all of
the information in the warranty packet, _do all of the following:_

* Bring the engine up to operating temperature and allow it to cool.  This
will take at least two hours.

* Readjust the valves to their proper factory specs.  (1600cc Air-cooled
models is .006&quot; for both intake and exhaust.)  Other models, refer to
your workshop manual.

* Re-check all of the nuts, bolts, screws, etc., that were removed and
reinstalled.

*Refer to your warranty packet under the &quot;Exclusions&quot; section for items
that can affect your warranty, and for items that are checked during the
installation inspection.

* At least five times the first time you drive your car, accelerate from
20 mph to 55 mph at three-quarter throttle, then get off the throttle and
let it decelerate down to 20 mph.  This should take 20 to 30 minutes.

* After your 30 minute run, check everything over including the ignition
timing, all fastening torques, rattles, or little mistakes that might have
&quot;popped up.&quot;  It is our recommendation to check your valve clearance at
this time, again!  A little added insurance.  Don't forget, they must be
adjusted cold, and they take over two hours to cool.

Now, you can drive normally, avoiding full throttle and steady speed
driving.  Don't &quot;lug&quot; the car.

-[end quote]-

I'm having the engine installed at Always V-Dub [Portland OR USA] since,
unlike me, they wouldn't have to do the work in their living room floor.

I realize now that one thing I'd better do is talk over with them what
*their* routine is--what oil they plan to put in it, whether they'll warm
the new engine up themselves, etc.  Any advice/experience here would be
welcome.

best
