Hi All -

Well, the time has come for me to be a one car owner for awhile.  I have sadly
decided to sell my 1979 Pop-top.   I've written about it quite a few times on
the list - and I'm sure I'll still read the postings on the list!

Here are the details -

1979 Pop-top (not a Westy?)
Two burner stove, one burner works great, the other needs the valve fixed
(bent)
DC/AC Fridge - works great - can run for days on the aux. battery, hooked up
to the 110 plug also - even freezes things!
Sink - needs new pumps - I'll put them in if you want - (at least one of them)
Engine completely rebuilt in Summer '98 - 2000+ miles on the rebuild
All new bearings, rods rebuilt, brand new pistons and cylinders, rebuilt heads
- valve job, exhuast guides, exhaust valves, etc., brand new lifters (only 200
miles on them)
All new gaskets of course
Hydraulic Lifters - no adjustments!
New plugs, cap, rotor, points, voltage regulator, Brand NEW Bosch fuel pump -
I bought the best for the Fuel Injection!
Alternator seems ok, transmission good - pops out of reverse if under high
load
Good clutch, good tires

The only problem with the whole scenario is an engine noise - one mechanic
said it was deep in the case, all the others say it is something in the valve
train - hence the brand new lifters, no one thinks it is a rod or anything so
detrimental.

Interior extremely nice, have material to finish curtains matching seats
Has full bed in the back - all the way across - closet is behind drivers seat
- very roomy!  Full bed on top - canvas is in near perfect condition, has
straight up top - the larger style with more room, 

Propane tank under van recently recertified (every 12 years?)

Mechanic says steering is perfect - just needs bearing tightened, a lube and
then an alignment

Body very nice, has a few small dents - only battery tray rust

The van is in Corvallis, Oregon - I live in Salem, Oregon

Asking $2500 or first reasonable offer - if it is a list member I'm willing to
deal!

I would like to sell ASAP -
