There was this thing on TV . . I was at somebodies house . .

I don't think my tv works, it's been out in the rain too long . .
It was a matter of it or the new engine had to go . .  :-)

Did I mention there is only one local tv channel . . ?  :-)

The Toyota people had put a couple Land Cruisers or Rovers whatever,
on the South Pole to be the second to achieve the pole . .
Volkswagen was first, as most us mavens know . .

You can still get parts there . . talk to Joe Schaeffer in Maint.
at the Science Station. . .

Or the '67?, I think, is still parked under an undetermined quantity
of water there  . . . pristine like the Titanic . .  :-)

I want to give my rendition of the event with toyo as seen by me
in the comfort of someone elses arm-chair . . 

That Landcruiser/rover? is a nice vehicle . . $36K I think . . 

So someone brought his mom along . . :-)  they put these elaborate
&quot;cow-catchers&quot; on the front and rear of the vehicles . .

Made of light-weight tubing, they stuck out about nine feet front
and rear . .  had to fold up when not in use, to keep from 
stobbing their nose into a hill  . .  or building . . :-)

The purpose of these &quot;chingader.r.r.r.ros, is to keep them from
falling in the crevasses they cross . . .

Cracks in the ice floes, can just be little cracks or they can 
open just under the surface into large tombs . . you get the idea.

If they fall thru with the tires, the long catcher will hold them
till the other guy can winch them out . . 

Then they equip these SUV's with big honkin' tires with low pressure.
One of them towed a trailer, with something square-like under a 
tarp . .  I will bet there was a generator and 200 gal. of gas
under there . .  :-)

They were stopping at night for safety, (mom again) and there is 
no way those toyos would survive a night without heaters . .
Oil, water, tranny, etc . . even the tires get flat on one side.

Small aside . . &quot;in the old days . .&quot; up in Alaska, the pilots
would drain the oil out of their engine and put it on the back
of the cook-stove till morning . . pick it up on your way out. .

They were careful to avoid any of that on the documentary . .

Now comes the stranger part . . because of the nature of the 
&quot;cow-catchers&quot;, they are approaching these cracks in the ice,
straight-on . .  

Second aside . . . in crossing ditches etc., you approach at a 
45 degree angle so that only one tire at a time is in ditch, out
of traction . . this is true even in a 2WD . . .

So because of the &quot;catchers&quot;, they are hitting these &quot;cracks&quot;
head-on . . 2 tires at a time . . .

So if you recall the low-pressure tires,  . . . this equals a 
&quot;tire fixing contest&quot; . .  :-)

The front tires are in contact with a sharp edge, pushed right to
the rim, you have a flat . .  the rears are having to double up
on pulling torque, and spin off the rim, you got a flat . .

These were obviously tubeless, I can't guess whether they should 
have had tubes or not . . I think yes . . they should have . . 
Maybe no due to the temps and the composition of tubes ?  . .

The documentary didn't indicate this but if you read the signs . .

They did show a real righteous re-install of tubeless tire back 
on rim . . he used starter fluid . . why would they be carrying 
that with these new toyos . .?  :-)

He set it up just so . . put some starter fluid in the tire . .
stepped back a ways and using his lighter, he held it under the 
stream of starter fluid which leaped out there and ignited the 
fluid in the tire which went &quot;Pop&quot; and was back on the rim . .

Looking at it from my arm-chair as it were, he put just the right
amount in the tire, and set it off with a reasonably safe method
that allowed him to be several feet away when this happens. .

The fact that this was so perfect can be attributed to just plain
skill or I like to think they had hundreds of feet of film to 
work with . .  :-)  the tire jumped about 2 inches and settled. . 

Some of you have heard of using gasoline the same way . . .

Since Bevis and Butt-head, everyone knows of the flammability of
hair-spray . . 

Lots of ways to get that tire back on the rim . . question is . .
do you feel lucky . .  :-) . .  

Gasoline has many uses . . expedient fire-power etc . . 
Beer-can launchers . . twinky's . . .  flaming twinky's . .

I don't do warnings or I would warn you of thinking about the 
above . .  :-) 

I think I can get a tire back on the rim with my &quot;come-along&quot;. . 

Come-along is a ratchet pulley thing with some 5/16 cable, for 
pulling stuff . .  an irish good-luck charm, if you will . . :-)

Wrap come-along around the center of the tread and winch . . 
Squeezing the center there should force the tire back on the rim.

This is Spring . . discounting today which rained . . in my area,
that's when you start checking out your old roads in the mountains
that have been closed all winter . . 

I'm surrounded by five National Parks here . .  

This time of year, you sharpen the chain-saw and stick it in . 

There will be trees across these secondary roads more often than
not . .  my saw is just a 2 horse with a 14&quot; blade . . it could
be even smaller with say a 12&quot; blade . .

I'm not logging, just clearing away small stuff . . 
If it's too big . . go somewhere else . .  :-)

Of course you still have the possible of it falling between you 
and home . . in which case you gnaw with the little saw and winch
with the come-along . .  :-)

That's what the word &quot;adventure&quot; means . .

Not much to talk about if you didn't almost die . .  :-)

In Spring and Summer, I drop the rain gear from my pack and rely
on the &quot;expedient rain-coat&quot; a 30 gal. plastic trash bag . . :-)

You want a laugh, take one of those trash bags and fill it with
water to take back to the camp . .  still . . it's a bucket  :-)

Dig an appropriate size hole in the ground and put that bag of 
water in it and it's a sink . . 

Even in the Summer I carry a 2 mil plastic drop cloth for a tent,
etc.  Even in sunny California . . I didn't once and &quot;damn near
died&quot;. .  :-)  see how that works? . .  :-)

You guys know about the &quot;Water Still&quot; . . ?  

I tell you anyway . .  It amounts to a ten foot square sheet of 
4 mil (.004&quot;) clear plastic . . piece of tygon 1/4&quot; clear tubing.
about 8 foot long . . 

That's it . .  another charm . . this one is for the desert

What you do when the situation calls for it is dig a pit, about 
4 foot across, a few inches deep, depending on what you distill. . 

Out in the center of your pit, you put a container, tin can, etc.
In the can you put one end of the tubing . . 

If there's moisture in the ground, you might want to dig a bit 
more . .  

Over the pit you put your sheet of plastic and stake it down . . 
The ten foot square will make four five-ft sq. pieces for pits. .

Now you take a rock and drop it in the middle of the plastic, right
over the can . . . 

The sun will heat the objects or ground that you have in the pit 
and moisture will collect on the plastic and flow down to the
center point where the rock is . . drips in can . . 

You suck the water out of the can thru the tube you put in there.

You can wrap a sheet of clear platic around a tree branch with 
leaves. . . water will collect in the bottom . . 

All of this is moot if the charm is working . . .

As long as you have one of these with you, you won't need it. . 

I didn't one time and almost died . .  :-)

To close the South Pole thing . . it wasn't a Lief Erickson trip
if I got the right guy but hey  . . they made it. . 

If I was king, I'd imediately launch a counter attack with a couple
bugs and a splitty or two to carry extra beer . . .

I'd like to be going with you guys but I have to stay behind and
do &quot;king stuff&quot; . . .  :-)

west   :-)
