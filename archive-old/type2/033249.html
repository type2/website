&gt; A simpler (much!) method, is to spray any/all

&gt; is running at various rpm.....find a spot were the
&gt; idle changes when you spray? Well, you just found a
&gt; leak.
&gt; 

Another method (albeit potentially flammable) is to use a camping-size propane
cylinder, with the valve barely cracked, to locate a leak; use the nozzle to
get to hard-to-reach spots and isolate hose/fitting connections one at a time.
