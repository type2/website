Subject: burning bus on &quot;Cops&quot;

i was watching Cops sunday night (probably a re-run) but they had
an officer called to a structure fire.

when he pulled up, it looked to be a smallish shop with a few vehicles
around. upon closer inspection, a vehicle that was parked halfway inside
the burning building was also in flames. unfortunately, that looked to
be a bay window bus! yikes.

looked like they had a number of parts busses sitting near the structure
also.

when questioned by the officer, the person who caused the accident was
very distraught. he said something about he went to turn over the motor
w/o unhooking the coil, which created a spark...he was sort of rambling on.

the good thing is of course that he got out ok &amp; no one was hurt.

just a post to remind everyone to be safe while they are working on
their vehicles! i don't want to be reading about one of my fellow
listees in some kind of accident.

i'll take a ride to Bevery Hills,
just before dawn.
and knock the little jockeys off the rich people's lawns,
and before they get up,
i'll be gone.
