Subject: Re: Asbestos in your heating system.

does vw still replace the heater boxes, and all that good stuff? my
heater boxes are very rusty, so is all the pipeing and the heater
control boxes. i also found asbestos in the lower rear engine tin, the
one that goes directly above the muffler and honestly i was considering
reuseing it when i fabricated a replacement. asbestos is not harmfull in
any way UNLESS its air born. honestly i think the only bigger rip off of
the general public was Y2K..
