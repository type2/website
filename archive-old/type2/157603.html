Subject: Re: [T2] \What gauge is the wire??

&gt;I counted the dryer wire '8' and it had 19 strands.  18 of the strands
&gt;measured around .74mm and one of the strands measured about 
&gt;.53mm.  OK, I
&gt;thought, made in China quality.
&gt;
&gt;Then I checked the Home Depot wire.  It also had 19 strands, but about 
&gt;2/3's
&gt;(13 strands) measured about 1.55mm, and the other 1/3 (six strands) 
&gt;measured
&gt;1.20mm
&gt;
&gt;What gives??  is this common to have a mixture like that??  Is 19 
&gt;strands
&gt;per cable a common basis??

19 strand is very common, but not differing conductor sizes.

Concentric stranding, where there is a central conductor and layers are 
built up, progresses 1, 7, 19, 37... (1 + 6 + 12 + 18) where each layer 
has 6 more conductors than the prior. All conductors are usually the 
same size (cross sectional area), although some wires are made from 
non-circular conductors, which creates a smaller diameter overall wire. 
That may be the difference you're measuring.
