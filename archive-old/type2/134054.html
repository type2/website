Subject: EveryBus Seat Cushions

Hi,

There were a pile of door prizes at EB this year. A set of bay window 
1/3 2/3 split (three passenger, single of double cab ) front seat 
cushions was donated by someone. They were stored between my side 
tent and bus and were overlooked for the Saturday night give-away. I 
do not recall who donated them. Was it anyone on the list? I feel bad 
that they were left out and would like to return them to the owner or 
offer them to another camp out as a door prize. Please contact me off 
list if you were the donor.

Thanks
Chris
