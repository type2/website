Steve Dolan is right about the heat part.  Many times, i've used a normal 
household hair dryer to help get bolts, connections, etc. loose.  it's 
amazing how much help it is and it causes no damage.  Of course I only hold 
the heat to it for 15-30 seconds.  Greg

&gt;And when all else fails....  I have never had to go this far, but remember
&gt;heat can be your friend :-)  With a cone-in-cone compression lock, heating
&gt;the hub should release it quicker than faster.  I have never tried it as I
&gt;am afraid of melting some of the plastic and rubber bits back there, but
&gt;it has always been in my mind as a last resort.
