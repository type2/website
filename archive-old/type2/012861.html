Subject: Need Split tow bar / Vanagon Hitch (DC area)
Mime-Version: 1.0

Need to borrow the tow bar for next weekend that is.

Well I don't but Steve Dolan does, for next weekend along with
ideally a vanagon tow hitch.  Since he's gone this weekend I figured
I'd send this out and try to scare one up.  He's driving the '67 down
to NC and a friend of ours is tailing him in her '90 Vanagon so just
in case (I mean the '67 hasn't moved more than 10 miles under its
own power since 1980 or something) I think if anyone could let him
borrow one for the weekend, it might come in handy.  Anyone with
the vanagon tow hitch could easily let him borrow it off the van, it is
only 2 bolts, I'd let him borrow mine but I sold it to Charlie F.  It won't
occur to Steve to ask about this but it does to me as I'm feeling
guilt cause I was supposed to follow him.

I don't think he'll steal it 8-)

Steve still puts a lot into this list BTW folks, monetary and time,
if anyone can help out, I'll just say it, you should period.

Email him if you got one near (N VA, E MD, DC, SE PA, DE)

he is of course dworkin_at_type2_dot_com and copy dworkin_at_ari_dot_net

John
