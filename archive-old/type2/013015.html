Subject: NC bus owners list

After some discussion at Everybus, I have set up a list for VW bus owners (or anyone with an interest in busses) in the central NC area.  I expect it will be used primarily for discussion of events in the NC area, but just about any bus related discussion is ok.

To subscibe go to http://rtpvwbus.listbot_dot_com
