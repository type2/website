Subject: colapsing vacuum lines?
X-Diagnostic: Not on the accept list
X-Envelope-To: type2

I've been trying to diagnose a brake problem I've been having for the 
past few months, and here's what I've come up with:
I checked the archives and they weren't too helpful.
I'm leaking fluid, but there are NO drips anywhere. I'm guessing that 
when I remove the master cylinder from the servo, I'll find all of 
that &quot;missing&quot; fluid. Time to replace the master cylinder.
My RPM's drop when I step on the brake pedal, an indication of 
problems with the servo. Two questions arise:
1.(if it isn't already torn) will the brake fluid in the servo damage 
the diaphragm?
2. is it possible that a vaccum line can colapse?

I've looked at the lines and they LOOK fine, but I replaced one of 
them a year ago with a softer hose, not thinking about it maybe being 
able to colape.If this is colapsing, how would it effect my braking 
power?

Oh yeah, I have a '74 westy, 1.8L with the webber progressive.
Thanks for the help.
Joel
