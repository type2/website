Subject: Re: Secrets for Removing Slotted Plugs?

OK,here's the trick!!!
the way i see it, you want to remove the plug, then install 
a bolt to hold the tin.:
i believe the original EGR fitting is threaded 10X1.0 MM
this is a fine thread, and is down that hole about an inch.
the original could have easily galled on the way out, insofar
as carbon leeches up those fine threads, and it is difficult
to get heat that far down into the head without creating other
problems. the brass-tubed fitting collapses under that kind
of heat. the head could have been baked, then torch heat
applied, etc. and so on...
that is not the current problem, however. :
if all you want to do is install a bolt to hold the tin, you can
leave the plug alone. you have an inch of head to use.
tap a 3/8 thread, bottom out on the plug, and install the bolt.
use anti-seize on the bolt, and a grade 5 or stainless bolt.
the bolt doesn't have to be 3/4 inch long, does it ?!
if you mess with the plug, you are going to be/have a very
sorry camper !!!
