Subject: E-Brake vs. Foot brake

I have noticed for a while that my parking brake does not hold worth a crap
on any type of a slope. If I have it pulled and first gear engaged, it will
still slowly slink down a hill unless I chock the tire.

The brakes seems to work fine and upon further review from last night, the
pads have loads of life in them.

Why would the e-brake not want to hold (even if the undercarriage is tightly
adjusted) but the foot brake be just fine. Granted I understand the whole
brake fluid equation, but it seems as if I will need to start going to the
gym to pull this lever hard enough for it to engage.

Thoughts?
