It's wierd because after many years of the drink drive rate (and the
coresponding number of accidents) going down it is (according to the radio
news) going up again .. Certainly locally the moron's are out in force ..
Given that I live in about the lowest crime area in the UK (Very few people
lock their doors, and certainly not their cars ..) we have had a spate of
really silly drink drive related accidents.    Someone stole our Morris
minor and ran it into a poor girl who was driving a little peugeot and
broken both her legs and her pelvis .. (Which for a 19 year old must be
appalling) .. Then we had the &quot;Roadsign man&quot; who demolished 6 keep right
Chevrons .. and then clipped the War Memorial and turned his car over into
the bus shelter ..This was on Saturday night before rememberence Sunday ..
The police managed to move the car and we had a sweep around ..   but the
ceremony had to take place in a mess ..

Then last saturday night someone drove into the garden of a house,  Some of
the houses have an external Gas meter next to the road .. which he hit ..
and broke .. ten houses had to be evacuated at 2am .. Typically this was
right next to our friend house .. and they have 5 children .. 3 under 5 ...
can you imagine how easy it was for  them to collect this lot and walk (not
allowed to turn on any lights or start a car .. ) a quarter of a mile up the
road ..

It seems to me that there are fewer &quot;Just over the limit&quot; people now but
more &quot;Totally smashed&quot; morons .. and not just at christmas ..

Justin ..
