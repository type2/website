&gt; &gt; you seem to be describing the CO adjustment prochedure...  haven't gotten
&gt; &gt; that far....   engine won't idle at all.  I moved the flapper itself to
&gt; &gt; get idle not an adjustment.   how did it get out of adjustment. passed my
&gt; &gt; last smog test with good numbers. so why would I need now to adjust CO
&gt; &gt; level before I get the engine running?????
&gt;
&gt; Well, that whole system has a wiper that is screwed on to the flapper

right, there is a screw on the top and a bolt clamp on the side seems it
would move the one on the bolt with a backfire??? not sure though.

&gt; vane.  I'm not sure if it's possible, but the backfire might have moved
&gt; the wiper in relation to the vane and is why you'd need readjustment.
&gt; Just a guess, of course.

my guesss too, twas hoping to find someone who would not have to guess?

&gt; Did you check the resistance values to make sure that the AFM is in spec
&gt; for your model year?

after lunch, had to get a lead for my VOM, left it somewhere
also another search of garage for another AFM


thanks
Bob
