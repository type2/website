forgot to say...

Lighter colors dont cover well... swo if your bus is dark, primer it in
anticipation of the event.  then you will have a nice clean surface to
paint on. )you can prime it with a roller and any light neutral paint..
i'd use a light tan or egshell green, very light colored either way.
(colors applied on white are too antiseptic looking for me, as paint is
translucend and the underlying color shows though to a degree and is what
gives paint depth in a way...)

take care,

steve

p.s. seach the archives for a chap named Richard Alexander Palmer.  He has
been gone from the lists a while... but he has hippy painted quite a few
busses.
