&gt; 
&gt; What worked for me was an 8'' nylon webbed strap, about an inch wide. I
&gt; looped this over the pushrod tube, gripped it close the the tube with
&gt; the Vice Grips and by carefully twisting and pulling I was able to free
&gt; the tubes without much trouble.
&gt; 
&gt; Reinstallation was much the same, though I found that applying pressure

Phil:
I can't restrain myself any longer. The tool I use for removing and
reinstalling pushrod tubes (and many, many other tasks) is a Knipex
pliers. Alligator, I think it's called. These are high quality (and
expensive) German channellock-type pliers with an important difference:
they've got 120 degree vees cut into the jaws. They work well on hexes
and rounds. The local dealer had a display rig with a 1/2&quot; galvanized
pipe which he would squeeze with the 10&quot; or so Knipexes and then proceed
to STAND on the end of the pliers which would not yield! They are also
much more gentle on fragile parts like pushrod tubes.
Incidently, they come in original equipment tool kits of Saab 9000's,
without the vinyl grips. That tells me something about Knipex AND Saab!
Sure wish VW wasn't so stingy with the tool kits!
If you found yourself marooned in a desert  with only one tool, this
would have to be it!
