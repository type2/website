Subject: Re: [T2] Increasing power

[...]Forget the type one idea unless your going to spring a lot of 
money for a Pauter big block and associated crank etc.  last one i set 
up about 4 years  ago  ran  a  little over 7000 dollars and took  6  
trips to a machine shop for tweeking.  the custom clutch pack was about 
  another $300.  you can push a bus  on a standard heavy  setup type 1,  
but not  a vanagon.  the  2.4 porche  is the better choice by a  long 
shot.  Or if you want to real  heavy try the 911 cerrara engine.   
unfortunately i  am  just  stupid enough to  try that one.
you can also get slip in jugs to take your current engine out to about 
a 2.5L.  I dont  recommend  slipins for  endurance  though.  Had 
strange things happen with them on type 1 engines and they dont have 
the temp range of a vanagon engine.

&gt; Anyway, a friend who has numerous Porsches in various states and a

&gt; of
&gt; all those carbs and Porsche prices in general.  I know the engine lid
&gt; needs to be modified and one needs to fabricate an engine mount and
&gt; exhaust (MSDS kit too expensive) and use a different flywheel (KEP), 
&gt; but
&gt; any other thoughts on this conversion, or ways to get a healthly power
&gt; increase from the type 4 in there now?
