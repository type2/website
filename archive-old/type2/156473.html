Subject: Re: [T2] adhesive panel repairs?

&gt; &gt; vehicle and it could strike another vehicle and cause injury and property
&gt; After consulting with Ford's Explorer Division, the official Chevrolet
&gt; response is that the separation is the result of underinflation...(Hey,
&gt; it might work... ;-)

No, Ford claimed that it was faulty tires made by Firestone.  _Firestone_
claimed that the failures were caused by Ford's low inflation pressure
recommendations, prompted by ride quality complaints.

I tend to believe Firestone, since Ford pickups that used the exact same
tire at higher inflation pressures didn't have any tire problems.
