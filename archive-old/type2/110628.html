&gt; hello
&gt; did any body ever build in a hydraulic clutch in a t2b from a t3 or any

I'm sure it can be done.  You just have to workout the pushrod from the
clutch pedal to the clutch master cylinder......if a vanagon/T3 slave
cylinder doesnt work due to mounting concerns on a bus/t2 transaxle then
you could look into the various slave cylinders used (at least here in the
states) for these conversion to bug and bus transaxles for offroad use.

&gt; other car , i am building a cu ingene in my t2b and wondering if i cannot

Could you clarify what a &quot;cu engine&quot; is?


&gt; use the gearbox of the cu wich has a lot less miles than the original one

I'm still not clear on what a &quot;cu&quot; is...but if you're refering to a
vanagon/t3 transaxle/gearbox the clutch connection will be the least of
your worries.

The shift linkage connects to the /side/ of these units instead of the
front, for one.  T2/bus nosecones/linkage will not fit.  You'll need to
fabricate connections for the shift linkage as well as a front mount
system.

If a &quot;cu&quot; is something else let us know and we'll offer what suggestions
we can. :)
