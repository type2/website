Michael,
  In regards to putting the 74 (type4) engine into the 63 VW, if you look in
any issue of HotVW's magazine you will see a couple of ad's concerning this
very thing.  One of them Next Generation, will sell you a Type 4 Upright
Conversion Manual explaining what you need to do to make the conversion for
$29.95.  Next Generation is on 'the net' at NEXTGEN_at_worldnet.att_dot_net.  The
second ad is from
DTM T-4 Upright Conversion Kits.  They sell the materials necessary to make
the conversion, in kit form.  Their web page is at
www.spiretech_dot_com/~opshroud.  The biggest problem seems to be in the
cooling, since the cooling fan in the type-4 engine was moved to the back
end of the engine and added about 11 inches on the length of the engine.
This fan has to be removed and a shroud, much like the shroud on the type 1
engine, has to be added at the front of the type-4 as it is on the type 1
you now have in the 63.  Everything I have read about it seems to indicate
it is a great way to get a lot more power into Bus. Hope this helps a little.
                                                        Janyce
