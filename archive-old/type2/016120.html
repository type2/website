Sounded like it was more oriented towards MGs or Jaguars! My VW
bus doesn't do any of that stuff!

This is not a slam against the VW, but is offered in good humor.

The 23rd Psalm to the Volkswagen

The Volkswagen is my chariot, I shall not want another.  It maketh me to
lie down in wet places.  It leadeth me into muddy waters.  It hauleth my
stuff.  It leadeth me in the paths of tribulation for it's namesake. 
Yea, though I run through the valley at 45 per, I am towed up the hill;
for it's engine quitteth on me.  It's springs and it's shocks they
torture me.  It prepareth a breakdown in the presence of mine enemies. 
It anointeth my head with oil. It's heater worketh mostly in the
sumertime.  Surely service and repairs shall follow me all the days of
my life; and I will dwell in the house of the Mechanic forever.
