Justin,
I know this thread is getting old, but I thought I would toss in a couple of
Lincoln's myself.  Last week I removed and replaced the 2.0 FI in my 76
Westy for the fifth time in 6 months.  When I purchased the bus, the engine
had recently been rebuilt, but the rebuilder didn'nt know what he was doing.
Among other things, he installed the cap that covers the end of the camshaft
backward and it finally rubbed on the cam until it broke and caused massive
loss of oil.  I limped home while replacing a quart every 20 miles or so.
He also, like this Georgia guru wants to do, left out the thermostat and
flaps from the cooling system.  I found some used flaps and replaced them.
On the surface it appears the flaps are important because they direct air
over the cylinders.  The truth is the air will travel over the cylinders
whether the flaps are there or not (assuming the rest of the cooling tin is
in place).  More important is the postition of the the flaps when open for
the full cooling effect.  When fully open, the flap by the oil cooler
actually covers the top of the cooler and creates a diversion opening in the
fan shroud that routes a significant amount of air over and through the oil
cooler.  It works like a cupping effect and is the only way the oil cooler
will get a significant amount of air to pass through it.  Without the flaps
the air will pass by the oil cooler and out through the #3 and #4 cylinder.
Very little air will actually pass through the oil cooler itself.  Remember
that air cooled engines are oil cooled engines.  With flaps removed the oil
cooler will not provide enough cooling and the engine will run hotter.
Period, period, period.  Be wise and take your bus to another mechanic
because this guy does not know what he is doing.  Good luck.

&gt;	Today, he told me that the Georgia heat justifies permanently
removing the
&gt;air control flaps.  Insisted, in fact.  He also indicated that the flaps
&gt;aren't too critical for warm-ups in the *reasonable* winters here...

&gt;I've never heard this before, and I certainly don't remember seeing it in
&gt;Muir.  Does anyone have any perspective on this?
