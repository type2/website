Subject: to buy the '71 or not to buy

Found a 1971 for sale $500.00. Has the usual rust but the PO has all the 
panels to replace the cancereous areas(+). I will view it this week in 
person. Has an oil cooler leak (+/-). Has Westy interior(+). Needs tires and 
brakes (+/-). Owner saved all parts, plus has extra stuff that goes with/for 
the bus(+).

Has been welded up with &quot;horns&quot; so (owner speaking) &quot;that it can accept a 
bug motor... don't know how to judge this(-)(-)...NEED SOME IMPUT FROM THE 
CONTINIUM.

What do you all think? Worth the price? What about the welding up for bug 
motor?
