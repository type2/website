&gt;Hi!  I have a 78 westy with an oil consuming engine.  I know I need to replace

You must take it apart, and measure things.

&gt;If I tear it all the way down (split the case, replace bearings, grind the 
&gt;crank
&gt;and cam, etc...) why not buy a rebuild engine?

Because you have no idea of the condition of the parts used, and to what 
tolerances
they were fitted.  Just another &quot;unknown rebuild&quot;--may last 5,000 miles, 
may last 90,000.

If you rebuild it yourself, you will know *exactly* what you have, and what 
degree of care
was taken in it's assembly.  I will also increase the &quot;bond&quot; between you 
and your transportation.
