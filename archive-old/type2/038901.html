&gt; Hello all,
&gt; 
&gt; im bran new to the list!  My girlfriend and I have been planning a cross
&gt; country trip for a couple of months now and are planning to leave in
&gt; June.  We will be doing alot of camping and backpacking so we wanted to
&gt; get some insight or suggestions as to the essential things we would need
&gt; to take with us.  Not only for the bus but for ourselves as well.  We
&gt; plan to travel for awhile and have become overwhelmed with the things we
&gt; are taking with us.  We also have our two dogs, so suggestions for them
&gt; would also be appreciated.  Again any advice from anyone who has done
&gt; this or traveled for awhile would be fantastic! Thanks for the help and
&gt; the insight

Well, I could suggest leaving the dogs at home, but I find that dog lovers
don't take well to that.  Be absolutely sure that your dogs recognize your
bus as &quot;home&quot; and that you keep very close track of them.  Nothing will
ruin a trip faster than the loss of a pet, and if the pet gets lost it's
unlikely that they will be found again.  I used to go desert camping with
a group of about 20 families.  We would go out once a month and about
twice a year someone's dog would run off.  This ruined the outing for
everyone.

As far as preparation of the bus, check out the archives.  Lots of good
information there!
