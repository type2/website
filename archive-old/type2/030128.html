&gt; Both Bentley and Haynes say to detach the axles at the tranny and pull both

Yes, esp if you dont intend on seperating them.


&gt; I want to swap the tranny drum to drum.

You /are/ aware that the drums, brakes, stubaxles, bearing carriers, and
cv joints/axles are NOT an integral part of the transaxle itself?  You
will need at the very least to disconnect the CV joints from the
transaxle, remove the transaxle, and then remove the bearing
carrier/stubaxle/brake assembly from the swing plate. You dont /really/
need to unbolt the CV from the stubaxle, I suppose.


&gt; Would it be that much more difficult to remove the engine then do the tranny 
&gt; with axles on?

you can remove the engine first, then unbolt the axles and remove the
transaxle seperately...but why bother with those 4 unconvenient bolts,
when you can just pull the front and rear of the whole unit?

As for trying to remove the transaxle with CVs, axles, and bearing/brake
assemblies attached...THAT would be awkward.  You'd have a very very good
chance of destroying your CV boots in the confusion.  or even popping the
CV's out of joint by bending them to far.

&gt; I have a floor jack and plywood to support the engine. Pulling both at once 
&gt; might be too cumbersome. Though I do have a buddy helping.

Concrete floor?

Its one-man doable if you balance just around the front edge of the engine
case.  One hand on the jack handle, one hand on the top of the fan shroud.

With two people its a snap.

but again, WITH the cv's removed from the transaxle.
