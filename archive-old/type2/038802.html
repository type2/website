Is there any way to get the alternator outta my '74 1.8 liter engine w/o dropping the heater boxes?? I've got all the tin off and the fan housing loose, but looks like the heater boxes gotta go before I can slide the housing up and out.  I simply hate dropping the heater boxes...

If someone knows a better way to get the alternator out without dropping the engine, please let me know.
