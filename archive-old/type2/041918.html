Subject: Re: Too much advance   HELP!

I will shortly be finishing a project involving an 1800 bus engine and was 
hoping to be able to re-install  my stock dist. with vacuum advance/retard.  

Problem: I will no longer have the original intake manifold location for the 
retard signal. 

General consensus seems to be that its OK to use the dist. with just the 
advance hooked up.  I hate to rehash a question already asked, but I am 
seeing some conflict regarding what to do with the retard port on the vacuum 
canister.  I have seen and been given advice to plug the retard side of the 
vacuum canister AND to leave it open to the atmosphere.

I realize I can (and probably will) experiment a bit with my timing light and 
see what happens both ways, but it is difficult know what will happen under 
load (where the rubber meets the road!).

Other than &quot;buy the later bus distributor without the retard port and don't 
worry about it any more&quot;, does anyone have any rational based on theory, 
experience or even actual dyno testing with the vacuum/retard dist.?  (The 
most detailed rational I have seen so far has been the one for leaving it 
open.)
