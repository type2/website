&gt; 
&gt; Panelvan
&gt; Truck
&gt; Kombi
&gt; Deluxe
&gt; Camper
&gt; Special Model
&gt; other

Transporters: Kombi, Highroof Kombi, Panel, Highroof Panel,
Single Cab, Double Cab (or Crewcab).  Ignoring things like
the flatbed, lowered bed etc. for the moment.  Also, 
Ambulance and Fire Truck.

Passenger Vans: Standard, Hardtop Deluxe, Sunroof Deluxe
(for Splitties).  Standard, Deluxe (for Bays).  Bus, Bus L 
(early Vanagons); Caravelle C, Caravelle CL, Caravelle GL, 
Caravelle Carat, Multivan (for late Vanagons).

And Campers, which started life in Hannover as Kombis.
Only Westfalias were officially sold by Volkswagen.  All
others are retrofits.

Hope this helps.  Maybe also take a look at this article:

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
