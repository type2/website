Subject: Re: [T2] Dual solex carbs

As an aside to this discussion...

Some friends have a very nice '72 Campmobile with a 2.0L replacement engine
[original milll was a 1.7L] installed by the PO.  It's running the complete
dual carb induction system from the original engine and all records, etc.,
indicate the carbs are still jetted as installed at the VW factory.  This
bus runs beautifully, and exhaust analysis, plug check, etc. show the fuel
mixture to be spot on.

When they first took it in for service the &quot;VW specialist&quot; insisted they did
not have dual carbs on their engine [they had asked that the carb balance be
checked as part of a major tune-up].  They had the good sense to find a
different technician.
