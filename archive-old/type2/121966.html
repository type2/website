&lt;&lt; Wow, that's a name I haven't heard for a while! I actually have their
track &quot;Smell of Incense&quot; on my Westy's indash MP3 drive.  Other personal
favorites that share the &quot;psychedelia&quot; folder on my hard drive are H.P.
Lovecraft (the band, not the poet), Bubble Puppy, Pearls Before Swine,
Kalaidoscope, and the Glitterhouse.
