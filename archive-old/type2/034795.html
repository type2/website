&gt;  While under there, I
&gt; noticed a 1/2 inch or so hose connected to the front of the master
&gt; cylinder.  It was loose and had no hose clamp.  As the brakes worked
&gt; fine when I last drove it, I am wondering what it is.  I am assuming it
&gt; is the vacuum line from the engine but this is the first time that I
&gt; have ever seen a vacuum line for a power brake booster connected to the
&gt; master cylinder rather than the vacuum reservoir.   As I couldn't get
&gt; into a position to see the entire vacuum reservoir to verify my
&gt; conclusion, I am wondering if someone can help.
&gt;

No, that is NOT vacuum. That is the fresh air source for the front side of
the booster. The other end goes up into the open framework of the drivers
door. The front of the booster has to be open to the atmosphere in order for
the diaphragm to move. The hose is there to keep water and dirt from
entering since the booster is so low and exposed to the elements. You would
need to drive into a puddle higher than the front wheels to get water in the
booster:) In a passenger car, the front end of the booster is reversed and
inside the car, so clean air comes from the passengers compartment.
