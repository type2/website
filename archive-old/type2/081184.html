Hello all,
            I got a CB radio today.  After EB I knew I should get one.
My buddy gave me his old one.  So I am home now, and the electrical
genious in me has a question.  How in the world do I hook it up?  A lot
of people said the splice a line off the cigarette lighter.  Well, I
aint got one a dem darn things!!  I have no electrical experience at all
and am not even quite sure what I need.  I do have a package that has
connectors and a crimper and stuff.  Any guidance for the mentally
challenged?  Thanks
