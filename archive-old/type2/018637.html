Subject: J-tube tin / '72 vac dizzy
Message-ID: &lt;3771688E.6CD95726_at_ix_dot_netcom_dot_com&gt;

I have decided that I don't need heat, and am going to replace the
rusted out old heat exchangers in my '71 for some shiny new J-tubes. 
After checking the archive, and several messages from the list, I have
determined that I need some engine tin to accomodate the j-tubes.  I
called Berg to obtain these tin parts, only to find out that they will
not be available again for awhile, if at all. VW of Brazil no longer
stocks them.  I was told by Berg that it is a kind of channel that
directs the air to the back of the vehicle.  Does anyone out there have
these engine tins?  I was hoping someone could get me at least some
pictures, or drawings, so I might have them fabricated.  Anyone else use
another method?

Also, the dizzy on my new '72 is bad, oil all over the place inside. 
Anyone got an extra they are willing to part with?

Finally, after spending a weekend working on the '72 engine on the
ground, I need an engine stand.  After calling around to most of the So
Cal VW shops, I found that the engine stands most people are selling,
made by Bugpack or Empi, will not support a Type 4 motor.  My housemate
has a universal stand for V engines, so I thought that might work.  My
plan is to get a bellhousing and weld/bolt it to a piece of metal plate
drilled to accomodate the mounting locations on the stand.  Anyone see a
problem with this?  Anyone do anything similar?  

Thanks for the help,
