Unless you've had experience making transformers and/or motors, I'd
recommend against doing it.  Track down a shop that rewinds starter
motors, and tell them what you want done.  Most towns of any
reasonable population have such a shop.  One that's familiar with farm
implements would be a good choice, since there are a lot of old six
volt tractors still running around....

`uF' stands for micro-Farad, which is one millionth of a Farad.  The
Farad is the unit of capacitance.  Thus, this is a capacitor.  It's
purpose is most likely to reduce the anti-social effects of applying
or removing power from a coil (aka the motor windings) on the rest of
the system.  You probably want to replace it because it's dried out
and no longer functional at this point.  Use something with about the
same capacitance (0.4 uF), but make sure the replacement is rated for
at least 20 volts (operating voltage of up to 14.7, plus some slack
for a less-than-precise voltage regulator).
