I apologize in advance for the sketchy details...
My cousin blew the engine on her '78 Westy and bought a factory rebuilt
engine to replace it.  The shop installing it said it was a different type
of engine-though manufactured a few months apart-and had to modify it a bit
to get it to fit.  After much frustration they now cannot get it to
run-something about the ground or the computer reading &quot;shut down fuel&quot;.  If
he puts fuel in it himself it will run.  That's about all I know.  Can
anyone offer advice-the poor kid's spent all her $ on this bus and might
just throw in the towel.  Thanks much.
