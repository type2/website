Subject: timing

I think you have it backwards. ATDC is retarded, not advanced. The idea
is to
advance the timing before the piston reaches TDC so the mixture has a
chance to
begin ignition and reach it's full potential at the best time for the
combustion
to continue through the downstroke.

&gt; &lt;&lt; Bently says that the
&gt;  engine should be at 10 ATDC, and by a quick look at someone elses
scale
&gt;  noticed that mine was down around 5-10 BTDC. &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; VW just did that to meet emitions... in reality no engine should be
timed
&gt; after tdc,  (anti knock sensors probably retard timeing this far
though thats
&gt; a different story though) im probably wrong, any other reason to time
&gt; something btdc? anyway, the further you advance your timeing the more
power
&gt; you get (dont go setting it to 50 atdc, it'll shake it self to
pieces), but
&gt; it will run hotter and be more likely to ping. The stock setting for
my
&gt; engine is 5 after, i have it set at tdc or  5 before, somewhere around

&gt; there....
