I'd have to agree that other aircooled types treat Vanagon people like 
poor relations. Scooting around town all day in my '82 doesn't get me 
a wave or a nod but a trip around the block in my '73 Thing has people 
grinning from ear to ear. I realize the Vanagon is sort of square (no 
pun intended) but I still love it for many of the same reasons I love 
my Thing.
