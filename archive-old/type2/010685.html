Subject: attaching muffler, time-sert

Listees,

I bought a new muffler for my '71 and finally got all the bolt holes, etc. lined up. BTW, a product called time-sert is a 
great stripped stud remedy. &quot;Painters Grinders,&quot; a machine shop here in Denver that does most of the vw rebuilds here, is the 
regional distributor. The tool kit including 5 inserts costs $55. Easy to use. Their web site is http://www.timesert_dot_com   .
They don't have a sales presence there though, just good graphics.

Anyway, the clamps that hold the muffler to the exhaust tubes, (you know the compressed material ones with the two 
hemispherical peices held together with 2 long bolts) end up sitting directly on the seam of the engine support beam. Try as I 
may, I can't get the darn things on. Anyone have a suggestion? What if I remove the bolt holding the engine to the support 
beam to the engine and then jack the engine up slightly to get a little room in there? There's only about 1/4&quot; in there now 
which isn't enough for the clamp!

Anxiously awaiting any advice,
Joel '71
