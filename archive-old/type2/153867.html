Subject: Tow bars and 72 buses

I'm looking for a way to tow my 72 bus and was looking at a tow bar made by 
jeremyrockjock listed on TheSamba.

  http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/classifieds/detail.php?id=272543

Searching through the archives I found the note down below indicating that 
it may not work on a 72.

Any opinions to this or on the tow bar made by jeremyrockjock?

   Thanks, Kevin
   Valdez, Alaska

&gt;&gt;  As for 73 and later I have found tow bars that bolt right into the holes 
&gt;&gt; that hold the bumper in, seems to work well.(none for sale all homemade 
&gt;&gt; though) As for 71 and 72 the only way I have found to tow them is with a 
&gt;&gt; dolly...
