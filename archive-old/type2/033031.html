Subject: Coil-over rear shocks

I strongly disagree.  Who are all these people you SAY are breaking shock
absorber attachment points?  Back in May I asked for feedback from ONLY
those having actual first-hand experience with coil-over shocks.

The results:

Six list members including David Schwarze, Karl von Salzen, Jamie Rivers,
Michael Benthin, and Jim Densley, representing several hundred thousand
miles on coil-over shocks answered that they had experienced no serious
problems.  I myself have 33,000 trouble-free miles on my last pair of Napa
coil-overs.

David Schwarze offered that an unnamed friend had purchased a bus with a
broken shock mount and that it had coil-overs, though he did not know the
history of the bus or how the shock mount came to be broken.

Jim Arnott offered that the shock mount on his '62 had broken while using
coil-overs, and he clearly thought this to be the cause.

That is six happy campers, one unhappy one, and one questionable.
