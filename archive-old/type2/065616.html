Subject: It's too hot in here

        I have a 73 with T4 engine.  Last week I removed the heater control
flaps that connect the heater boxes to the interior heating tubes.  I
replaced them with an elbow piece of heater ducting from the local hardware
store.  Now the heat is always turned on, but I figured with cold weather
coming soon it wouldn't matter.
        I am worried about how much heat I am getting from the engine.  The
heating tube at the front of the van under the dash gets very hot and the
lino on the floor by the rear heat duct has turned brown as if it is burnt.
        Am I supposed to get this much heat?  I have noticed the engine is
still warm an hour after driving.
        Would the heater duct modification I made increase the engine temp?
        What is the best way to monitor the engine temperature?
        What is the dipstick test?
and finally, what causes a T4 to overheat?

Thanx,
