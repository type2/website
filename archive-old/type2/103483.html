&gt;From where are you picking up the vacuum source?  I have a neighbor who just put a '79 2 liter into his 74 bus.  Despite my advise, he's using the Delortos (Big suckers!  Look like IDA Webers.) No x-over between the sides.

With the Dellortos no crossover tube is necessary since there is one barrel per cylinder.

&gt;Unless I can find a good vacuum source it'll have to be mechanical advance only. Open to suggestions.

I have a port on the left manifold that is hooked to the dizzy retard.  There is a port on the carb itself for advance.
