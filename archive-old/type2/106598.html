Subject: Re: [T2] Upper Starter Bolt

&gt; &gt;     I just thought I'd share with you something I've done to make
&gt; &gt;getting my starter in and out a little easier.  Any of you who have
&gt; &gt;removed and replaced your starter know what a PITA that upper bolt can
&gt; &gt;be.  Once you loosen the nut on the back end of it there's nothing to
&gt; &gt;keep the bolt from spinning, and that makes it hard to finish getting
&gt; &gt;the nut off.  And of course reinstallation is just as hard because the
&gt; &gt;bolt spins when you try to get the nut started.

&gt; The correct upper starter bolt has a &quot;D&quot; shaped head, the flat of which is
&gt; locked by a corresponding flat in the starter housing, specifically to
&gt; prevent the problem you describe. Stop by your nearest salvage yard and get
&gt; the proper bolt.

Maybe it would be better to actually look at something before giving your
opinion.




Paul
although I usually dont seem to have a problem with it this seems like a
good idea which will make things even easier. thanks.
