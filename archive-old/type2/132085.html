&gt; i guess you gotta learn the hard way sometimes!

to anyone who is doing this sort of work for the first time, the book &quot;how
to rebuild your aircooled VW engine&quot; by tom wilson, is indispensable. it
covers most aspects and models, from engine removal, rebuild and
installation, including the tin issue you have stumbled upon, and if you
have the book and read it well, this sort of &quot;learning experience&quot; can be
avoided. it is good to learn, but it doesn't have to be hard, or involve
extra work.
