&gt;
&gt; Well 70's came with a front mounted spare tire.


Are you sure about that?

The rather large dent that
&gt; you see behind it is from people using the tire as a bumper. Its one of
the
&gt; most common body flaws you can find. There are not too many buses out
there
&gt; without this dent. Thats why it is always a good idea to keep that tire
&gt; there.

Because the dent is there, or because  thats a good place for an auxiliary
bumper?

so you  Buy yourself a nice new tire all black and shiny and get a real nice
&gt; &quot;disk&quot; moon eye style hubcap. It gives your bus a real classic look.

The nice tire? the hub cap?  Or having the tire mounted on the front?

Spend
&gt; your money on some other more readily noticed aspect of your buses
exterior.
&gt; Just my two cents. keep the change.

How about not spending any $$$ taking  that spare tire mount off, and
chucking it! Puting the spare tire back in the back of the bus where it
belongs in the tire well , and not compromising the safety of the occupants
riding in the front cabin..
