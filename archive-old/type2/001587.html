Hello all,
 I finished putting in a 1600 in my 72.  I love it, I now have a daily
driver. The lack of power is hardly noticeable, the more I drive Bertha.
 I have just a few questions when IM going down hill in gear coasting she
seems to backfire, not loud, kinda like I'M making popcorn in the muffler.
But, just the slightest touch of the gas will stop this. I'M not quit sure
what is the cause, maybe a little adjustment on the carb?  One more
Question.  The electrical system is different on the 72, i hooked up the
original electrical system.  But I notice that when IM at a stop I can rev
the engine and the headlights go brighter for a second then to original
brightness, I'M not fluctuating the gas pedal, but giving a constant
progressive idle.  What does this mean? I have a new battery am I missing
something, the generator is going the battery, so it must be charging, but
why the fluctuating brightness.  Sorry, one more thing is when I'M heading
for a stop, she sometimes stalls, that's how I noticed the headlight prob.,
I haven't checked the gen for what its putting out at idle or if it
fluctuates when revved, will tomorrow.  But I'M looking for some ideas. &quot; I
spend to many hours on my VWs&quot;, wife quote! So any help to keep me outta the
garage for hours will be cool
  well thanks in advanced
