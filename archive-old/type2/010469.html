Lube! Lube! Lube!

Use spray lithium or silicone grease. - FLAPS.

Lube the wiper arm shafts on the front, outside. 

Lube all the linkage up under the dash where you can't reach.

Clean the connections to the wiper motor.

Could be a bad motor, but unlikely.

Smear a bunch of axle grease all over your windhshield - that'll fix it.

Should i use disclaimer here?  Okay, don't smear axle grease on your
windshield.
