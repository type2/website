Subject: Re: Perfect Propane Heater for Bus

Hi Parker,

I  used a propane radiant heater in my bus last winter, and it does work.
But there is still a downside, even with the shutoff for carbon monoxide ---
water vapour

When you burn propane, you create heat, carbon monoxide, Carbon dioxide, and
LOTS of water molecules. I found I usually had to keep the vent windows open
and the fresh air ducts up front open unless I wanted the windsheild
completely frosted over.

For early sping / late summer camping, they're terrific. Just give the
interior of the bus some time to dry out afterrunning the heater for
prolonged periods.

That's my $.02, YMMV.

Happy Trails,

&gt; Well, I know it's the wrong season to bring this up, but I just ran across
&gt; what looks like the perfect portable propane heater for our busses. Go to
&gt; www.mrheater_dot_com The unit is called the &quot;Buddy&quot;, small, portable and safe for
&gt; indoor use, (they say it was designed for use in tents and RV's, ect.) puts
&gt; out 4000-9000btu's, runs on a 1lb cylinder, or can be hooked into a 20lb
&gt; bottle with an adaptor. Has an oxygen depletion/CO2 auto cut-off, and sells
&gt; for about $100.00 I'm gonna order one when they become available, which
&gt; should be in Aug. Please check it out!
