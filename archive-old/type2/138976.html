It is CONCEPT CAR, not a production vehicle. Industrial designers are the
responsible for most car styling that gets done nowadays, not engineers.
Yes, the engineering disciplines of a vehicle manufacturer play a huge role
in the design team, but not so much at the concept stage, and this concept
car was a submission by a design studio for a competition. You can't judge
it as if it was a product. That is why it is called a concept. I am an
industrial designer, so that comment really hits a nerve. The people who
create the design concepts for vehicles are usually more &quot;artist&quot; than
anything else. Then the design team really takes over, made up of all the
disciplines of the manufacturing process, from marketing through to
production. 

I think it is a beautiful presentation, some very well thought out ideas,
and very true to the original concept of the westfalia model, right back to
the very first ones made. I give it two thumbs way up.
