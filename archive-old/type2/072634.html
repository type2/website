Subject: engine/trans removal
Message-Id: &lt;v0151010bb357cad5409b_at_[207.172.52.115]&gt;

A number of people on this list have said how simple it is to remove engine
and transaxle together and today I read the same advice in Bentley.

I have a 1776 with Kadrons in my '71 Westy.  To remove / replace engine
alone,  lots of twists, dips,  tilts, rotations, lowerings, raisings, and
just plain pushing and pulling are needed  -  mostly to clear the ears to
which the rear support bar bolts.

Has anyone removed this type of non stock engine with the transmission
attached?  Could you describe the process?  I can see no way to simply
lower it and pull it out. The carbs won't clear the tin in the engine
compartment.
