Installing either heater in your bus would be much easier if you were
the one that removed it from the donor bus and/or had a working
installation to compare to.  Putting any basket case back together is
going to take a lot of work and knowledge.  The manuals available for
these heaters are geared more towards maintenance, not
installation/assembly.  Imagine trying to put together an engine from
a box of parts when all you've got is the owner's manual that has some
pictures of the engine and how to do a tune up.

Given the amount of time I've spent acquiring working knowledge of my
BA6 while keeping it running, I would prefer to attempt to install a
BA6 instead of a BN4.  On the other hand, given the amount of time
that's been required to keep it running, I would be tempted to put a
much more expensive, modern unit in instead.  They are more self
contained and reliable.  Most likely safer as well, given the age of
the stock heaters.
