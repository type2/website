  The light housings are for a bus not a bug. Have you got any offers on =

  Actually you are totally RIGHT DAN!
  I had no idea what they were when I got them because they didn't have =
three sockets in each housing so I was confused....it was supposed to be =
the whole kit, but I had the lenses already.

  Anyway you and Erin both caught me on that one!
  Here is what Erin emailed me:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------=

  I saw your post come over the t2 list and so I went to your website.  =
The
  lights and seals at the bottom of the page are actually tail light =
housings
  for buses from 1963 to 1971 and not for bugs.  Matter of fact, they =
would
  work on my bus, Rob's bus, and Bryant's to name a few.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------=

  So I definitely stand corrected!
  (but I still got the wrong housings/sockets etc. dangit!)

  Happy Smiles and Waves to all!
