Subject: RE: [T2] Spark plugs

&gt;From: Nik Wiman

&gt;Also, has anyone had a plug blow out (physically ejected) from the socket?
&gt;Just wondering if its common and what damage might occur.  All seems well,
&gt;but a little scary.  Thanks.


I had that happen on my first bug. Dual port head was cracked ans threads 
for the spark plug were no longer there.
