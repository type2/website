Subject: find of my life a clean and interesting 70' Campmobile ( kind of
	long)

Ad in local paper says 

VW, 70, Camper
Excellent shape, many extras. 
815-544-2857

So i was like what the heck i will give a call to the guy and go see it so i 
call the guy and we made plans to meet the next morn so i go to his house. 
Where he shows me  some of the extra parts he has in his garage he has a 
engine and trans both really clean set up to start right up with gauges and 
what not. I was like wow. Cann't wait to see the bus. So we hoped in his car 
and away we went down the street to we came where the bus was. Threw the 
garage window i could see it was going to be a very nice bus. I could see a 
very unusal light bar on the back of the bus. No it is not a ambulance. So we 
went into the garage and my mouth just dropped with wow this is really nice 
before he even started it up or even opened the drivers door. When he opened 
the drivers door i seen many, many more extra stuff like CB, all kind of 
gauges, alarm, air shocks, level indicator for when you are camping plus tons 
of other stuff. Also had light bar up front and a bull bar. In the back there 
was boxes of rebuild carb kits, oil change screens, gaskets, few carbs, 
mannuals, more mannuals and even more mannuals Along with still alot more 
extra stuff i did not even go threw everything there was alot of stuff for 
it. I was hoping the guy was not asking to much out of my budget being only 
18 years old. But of course he was. He is was like do you think 10g is to 
much i am like no. it is a  very fair price for a bus in this condition
i told him he may have a hard time selling it this time of the year but it is 
worth a try or hit the show season in the spring and sell it really fast. So 
since i cann't afford it and i want to see this bus go to a great home i am 
posting it to the list. IF you have 10g and you want a really nice bus call 
this guy up 815-544-2857. You will also get a extra rebuilt engine and all 
the parts he has for volkswagens. Bus was his uncles and his uncle passed 
away but his uncle did alot of things to this bus which make it one of a 
kind. This bus is worth way more over 10g and with a good cleaning this bus 
could win many awards at shows. If you are interested in the bus you can 
contact me my e-mailing me and i will let you know any more info you want to 
know about the bus. 

Other wise you can go direct to the owner at:

815-544-2857
bus is located in belvidere, iL
75 miles from chicago.
