&gt; 5) Regarding alternatives to spraying, has anybody heard of using (or used)
&gt; foam rollers to apply the paint? Long time ago, when we wanted to achieve a
&gt; really shiny finish on furniture, we would use cloth to apply abound 10 coats
&gt; of varnish and the surface would be almost glass like, and we only used
&gt; 220grit sand paper....

Foam rollers would dissolve in the paint. A brush would work, but you'd need
a lot more paint (at several hundred dollars a gallon!) to get the same
effect as spraying.
