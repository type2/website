Subject: RE: [T2] Type 1 Thermostats found

&gt; Bug thermostats, brand new german, no longer 
&gt; available. 2 left $55.00 each.
&gt; http://www.vwparts_dot_net/garage.htm
&gt; I don't know if that's a deal or not, but thought I'd share.



Funny, someone posted that link months ago, and it said &quot;2 left&quot; way back
then too.  Not sure if no one's buying them, or if their website is really
outdated, or if they just always tell you they have 2 left. :-)  

In any case, that is about the going price. We have them for $52 with your
list discount:
