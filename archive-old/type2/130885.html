Subject: Re: [T2] Why Drive a Bus?

I have a chance of understanding what it wants and needs to be happy.

It is extremely versatile and can be configured to suite my fancy.
It can be maintained and customized on a relatively low budget.
Everyone else on the road doesn't have something that looks just like it.
