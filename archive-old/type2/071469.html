 Good Morning Folks,
     I didn't think I'd make it, but yesterday I hooked up the wiring harness 
 for my trailer, and took the '77 out on the highway. I've driven it around 
 town, but this was the first time I got her out on the highway at speeds up 
 to 65 mph. I even towed the trailer, kind of a &quot;dress rehearsal&quot; for the 
 drive to Everybus. I never got the front end aligned ( I replaced the axle 
 beam a couple of months ago) but it seems to track straight, and it stops 
 straight. The front end did seem to wander a bit, but it was windy 
yesterday, 
 and it may be that I'm just not used to it, since it's been almost a year 
 since I've driven a VW bus at highway speeds. If you want to see shots of 
 Alice with her trailer, here is the link. &lt;A 
HREF=&quot;http://hometown.aol_dot_com/fonman4277/77westy.html&quot;&gt;77Westy&lt;/A&gt;  See you 
 at Everybus 2001!      Jeff S.
  &gt;&gt;
