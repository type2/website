&gt; Is 65 mph realistic for a 71 Westy (1600 DP) Rebuilt Engine, new heads
&gt; installed with all tin and rubber? I'd like to be able to obtain that?

My 71 speedo reads 10 mph high as compared to a GPS.
I think my passenger car tires are partly to blame.
When I push it to 65 my oil runs hot but I need to make some corrections to 
my CR which was never set up properly.
I generally cruise between 55 and 60 with no problems but I don't have as 
much weight at you.
65 sounds like an optimistic expectation.
