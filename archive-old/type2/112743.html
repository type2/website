Subject: Louver Window Knobs

I just wanted everyone on the list to know that I found some Louver
Window Knobs at a local mobile home retailer for $2.39.  I want to thank
the person that suggested going to an RV distributor and picking them
up.  At every VW parts distributor they wanted between $10.00 and
$13.00.

Thanks again

Dean
