Subject: RE: [T2] weber carb set up

&gt;  I've got a few questions about the weber progressive carb
&gt; set up.  I've stumbled upon a 76 bus complete without any fuel injection
components.  I
&gt; know that fuel injected is the way to go but that will take time and money
&gt; to gather up all the parts.  I'd like to get this bus rolling
&gt; under it's own power soon.   What type of fuel pump are being used, the
electric
&gt; fuel pump is also gone, can I use a universal electric fuel pump?  If
&gt; anyone has info on setting up one of these  units I really appreciated
hearing about it,
&gt; also if anyone has a weber progressive setup that their selling let me
know.


The weber progressive kit is exactly what you need. The kit comes complete
with intake manifolds, air cleaner, carb, etc.  Yes, it can be used with a
universal electric pump (and in fact wouldn't work with the VW
fuel-injection fuel pump anyway).  You will need a pump with 2-4 psi output.
We sell a Facet pump that works well with it.  My part numbers are 43 067 00
for the carb kit and 412010 for the pump.
