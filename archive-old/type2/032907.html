Subject: mystery wire and then some

i have a stray wire under the dash of my '71 bus that appears to belong to
the non-functioning light switch - the switch that sits directly to the
right of the steering column, and to the left of the wiper switch. is this
switch supposed to control the front interior dome light [the one above and
between the two front seats]? if so, is that light supposed to have its own
switch built in? cause mine does, and that switch seems to work.

also, bentley mentions a &quot;fan motor, front&quot; in the schematics for my year.

fan? what fan? i don't see no stinkin fan.

thanks,
-perry
