&gt; OBC:  I'm looking for a good vac. advance dizzy or a way to fix the vac
&gt; advance on mine.

Priced one at a local FLAPS?

&gt;  I get a lot of what sounds like valve
&gt; clatter at high RPMs, right before the auto-tranny shifts.

Sound like ball bearings bouncing around inside the engine?  There are no ball
bearings to bounce around but ping, detonation, or mechanical problems could
sound like that.

&gt;  Could this be cause from not enough advance?

Usually too much advance causes detonation.

&gt;  How much advance does a 205S have without
&gt; working vacume?  I'm not sure if the 205s is right for a type4 motor but I
&gt; only have one vac port (Weber 32/36).  Any suggestions?

There is a 021 905 205S dual advance distributor, and a 022 905 205S single
advance distributor.

Full mechanical advance in the 022 905 205S is 20.5 to 24.5 degrees at 3400 rpm
(crankshaft),
while the 021 905 205S  has 21 to 25 degrees at 3400.

Is the vacuum port on the Weber ported or manifold vacuum?
