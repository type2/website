Subject: Re:Vanagon (TV sighting) [F]

&gt;Thursday night, on some Summer replacement show, &quot;Undercover&quot; or &quot;Deep into
it&quot; or sumpin like that, an undecover sting operation was put into place to
bust &quot;Johns&quot; who solicit the &quot;working folk.&quot; Of course the &quot;Johns&quot; are two
rowdy longish haired white guys in a white waterpumper vanagon.
&gt;
&gt;We noticed a few unrealistic things about the scene...
&gt;1. The sliding door worked (twice~!) without having to yank like a monkee
on coke in a documentary film clip to get the sucker open!  
&gt;2. The partner cop called into the microphone that two guys just picked up
the undercover police woman in a white &quot;Minivan&quot; !!!
&gt;3. The stereo worked in the van.
&gt;4. The front end didn't sound like it was held together with a broken KYB
shock.
&gt;5. The front rotors didnt chirp like a cricket on a PA system as they went
down the road.
&gt;6. The hosers yanked the center seat out of the bus.
&gt;
&gt;When will they ever come up with a realistic show for gosh sakes! =)
