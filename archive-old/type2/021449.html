Mark, Bob:
Yup, but having the 1.8 for a spare would be fine. It would be hard to tell the
difference of the 2 hp.
I'd ONLY consider using the 1.8 WITH the injection from the existing engine.
I agree, the dual carbs are troublesome and not the way to go if the injection is
present.

&gt; &lt;&lt; I have been told that an 1800 cc engine with duel carbs can be stronger
&gt; than my current 2000cc &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Bob,
&gt;
&gt; hmmmm,
&gt; Bentley says the 1800cc AW with dual carbs had 65hp, 92.4 ft. lbs torque
&gt; (SAE).
&gt; The 2000cc GD fuel injected engine had 67hp, 101 ft. lbs torque (SAE).
&gt;
&gt; Having run a fuel injected bus for a year now after replacing the weber IDF's
&gt; that were on it, I personally couldn't imagine returning to carbs!  FI
&gt; usually delivers fuel more efficiently than carbs.
