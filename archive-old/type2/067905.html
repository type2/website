hey everyone...
        not only was there a vw on Ellen last, but the Simpsons had one on.
Homer was dropping his fugitve Mother-in-law off in the middle of the desert
when an old-long-haired-hippy-dude with a early flower painted ELECTRIC bus
picked her up....the guy was complaining that he only had about 20 minutes
of power left and for them to hurry.  The bus sounded real quiet

cool
