HOWEVER

don't make the list so &quot;Fancy&quot; that you can't grab it with a simple link
such as you might have to use out on the road.

the way it is now, while there is a map and all you can still access the
state lists, which I print out and this works quite well the way you are
talking about spending a lot of time redoing

&gt; Im currently talking with a local about making a better way to print
&gt; up/search up/pull up the AIRS list. Hope to have it setup better soon but
&gt; we'll see.  We have spoken of many user self-performed tasks and so
&gt; forth...nothing is in stone yet. Also want to make it so users can self edit
&gt; their own entries but fear the unrulys doin what we wouldnt want done if you
&gt; know what i mean
