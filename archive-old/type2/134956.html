Subject: Re: [T2] headlights + fresh air fans

Your fans get power from the light switch. I would pull the speedo cluster 
and take a peek at your light switch. Look for a burnt wire or possibly a 
misconnected ground wire. It could be that part of the headlight switch has 
given out too. You could also try running a temporary power source to the 
fan lead wire and see what happens, obviously you would want to run an 
inline fuse on the temporary wire so you don't mess up the fans.

PS I found that you can remove the speedo cable easily by drilling through 
the turn signal houseing and removing it. You can get your hand in there and 
pull the speedo cable off very easily this way.

Good luck!!
