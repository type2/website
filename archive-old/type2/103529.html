Subject: Re: [T2] My Battery Fell Out...Help!!!!

I have a suggestion. My trays were both rotted out too. What I did was
1)    Cut off the positive battery wire right beside the terminal with bolt
cutters
2)    Remove the battery ground strap from the bus
3)    Relocate the battery under the z-bed under the back seat
4)    Drill a hole the size of a rubber grommet which will fit on the wire
5)    Pull the batt + wire out and feed it in through the new grommett to
the batt area
5)    Use a bungee cord or similar to tie the battery down
6)    Protect the terminals from shorting in some way, like wood or
something, or get a marine battery box.
7)      Install a new ground strap between the batt neg and a seat belt bolt
8)      Get a box or two of baking soda, and saturate the old box area with
soda, rubbing it in everywhere to neutralize the acid. Also, under the box,
on the quarter panel etc.
9)    Eventually, cut the rotted boxes out with a cutoff wheel, and either
replace with new panels, or make up a couple of replacement plates that fit
in out of sheet metal or aluminum. It should be an airtight seal, since the
cooling air is involved.

Subject: [T2] My Battery Fell Out...Help!!!!


Hello list members,

    I discovered that my passenger side battery on my 77 westy has fallen
through the floor. Fortunately, it is holding on by a small piece of metal.
I
looked at the replacement battery trays _at_BusDepot. Is that the best way to
go?
