Subject: Re: [T2] anyone have underdash parcel tray?

Aaack!  Thanks for bringing that up, Scott.  Judging from the picture 
on Bus Depot's website, this shelf will not work on busses that have 
the &quot;armrest&quot; style air vent mounted on the door panel.  The tray 
clearly goes in front of where the metal duct on the nose of the bus 
meets the plastic duct on the door.  The trim underneath the parking 
brake handle looks much different from my bus as well.

I may have to email Ron to cancel any order that may have been placed 
as a Christmas gift to me, 'cuz that's what I asked Santa Claus for.
