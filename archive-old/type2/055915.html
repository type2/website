Subject: Staying Cool

Thanks to everyone who responded to my query about swamp coolers. The
general consensus is they are great in high temp and low humidity
situations. But here in tropical North Carolina they would not do any good.
This brings me to the expensive question. I've seen busses in the junkyard
that have overhead  air conditioning units that are similar to the one shown
in my owners manual. Has anyone salvaged one of the  units and installed it
in their bus? I think the evaporator coil is under the bus. Where is the
compressor? What is the freon capacity? Assuming I can find enough parts to
make it work what kind of drain will it put on the engine? Is this a stupid
idea? Are there any currently available aftermarket AC units that would make
sense to install?

Thanks
Chris,
