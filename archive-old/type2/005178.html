&gt;&gt;  Thing is, it's a great bus and I want to keep it, so how do I explain
the air-cooled phenomenon to my wife when she asks, and i quote, &quot;Why do you
need three??&quot;

Try explaining why you &quot;need&quot; an armored car,  just because it comes with a
Rolls Royce engine.  Had to promise to keep it in the garage.
