Subject: Window Seal Dilemma ?

Howdy

I bought window seals from oeveedub about a year ago.
Kept them in the house until this week when I am fitting them to the windows 
in preperation of installing them this weekend.

I put the left rear bigger window seal on (not the vent window - but the one 
that accompanies it) and both corners are split as seen here.

http://www.jr-n-r_dot_com/images/kevin/WESTY/seal.JPG

The seal went on pretty easily and originally had a small split but now both 
sides are pretty much split all the way to the end on the inside as seen in 
the picture.

The split is on the backside or the side that will face inside the van.
The face of the seal or part of the seal that will be facing outside is fine 
with no split at all.

Since I paid a bunch for the seal and cant find the recipt my question is if 
I should be concerened about it or if this a common occurence and hopefully 
will be fine once the window is installed.

Any experience with this or input would be appreciated.

Thanks
Kevin
