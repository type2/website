If you know what you are using, let us know!  I would appreciate any
specs you have.  Sensor type, brand, etc. because it seems like that's
where the big price gap would lie.  I think it was David Schwarze that
said to accurate reading from an O2 sensor you need a wide-band sensor. 
Is that what you guys are using?

Thanks!

&gt; 
&gt; I have found over the years that &quot;identical&quot; products that cost half as
&gt; much...
&gt; 
&gt; aren't.

&gt; 
&gt; I'm not sure what they are using, but I DO know what we are using, and ours
&gt; is the best.
