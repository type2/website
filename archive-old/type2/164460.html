Subject: [T2] First Bus / Rebuild or Buy Longblock ?


&gt; I am new to this world of air-cooled, rebuilt a lot
&gt; of Jeeps and GM.  It seems to me that from a cost standpoint, due to the
&gt; damage, that a long block is pretty close to the cost of me buying the
&gt; parts and having the machine work done and putting it together myself.
&gt; Not to mention buying a long block for $1600 incl. shipping gives me the
&gt; chance to upgrade to the 2000.
&gt;
&gt; Am I correct in this dilemma?  Anyone else run the numbers and come up
&gt; with this?  Am I missing something?

You are correct in that you can't do a complete and comprehensive rebuild of 
an engine at a price that's cheaper than buying a longblock from one of the 
volume rebuilders.  Assuming you have the tools and the skills and the 
desire you might build a better engine at the price (no value attributed to 
your time) but you're just not going to build it cheaper.
