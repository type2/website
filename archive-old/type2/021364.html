Thanks for reminding me.
YES! There is supposed to be a rubber boot with a small slot on the bottom of
the road draft tube. The small hole holds a rubber barb onthe inside of this
boot. MAYBE West Coast Metric makes this piece!

&gt; remember to limit my paragraphs in the future.  The tube that appears to be
&gt; the overflow or vent from my oil filler goes down through the rear tin and
&gt; then just hangs out down there.  It looks like it might need a cap or filter
&gt; or something.  There is a small hole in the side of the tube right before
&gt; the end.
