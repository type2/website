Subject: Difference in engine types?
Date: Thu, 05 Nov 1998 11:08:46 PST

I know this is going to sound pretty stupid to most of you, but I am new 
at this. What is the difference between engine numbers like 1600, 1800 
and 2.0 litre. I am going to look at a '78
with a 2.0 litre fuel injected engine and would appreciate any advice.
Thanks.
           Simon
