Subject: Re: [T2] In need of interior parts ( special cargo door handle)

Hey Karl,

I was waiting for someone to comment on that. I have
not seen his door mechanism. I was just relaying the
info that he told me. I looked around and the only
type that I could find had the square fitting. I am
glad to hear that this his his problem and not that he
was missing a peice of the mechanism. I am sure he
will be glad to. Thanks for the helpful correction!

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Hello List,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My friend has a 71 bus and is looking for a few
&gt; parts
&gt; &gt; for it. He needs the inner cargo (sliding) door
&gt; &gt; handle. He said that the one he needs is NOT the
&gt; kind
&gt; &gt; with the small square fitting but one with a
&gt; fitting
&gt; &gt; that is &quot;oval with 4 splines&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I hate to tell you this but...... the &quot;oval with 4
&gt; splines&quot; piece is what is
&gt; cast into the plastic handle. His plastic handle
&gt; broke off and that is what is
&gt; left. It WILL come off the square shaft. Throw it
&gt; out and get any handle......
&gt;
