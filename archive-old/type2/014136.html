Subject: Stuck valves and promises


Sounds like the name of a song...

Anyway, #3 &amp; #4 intake valves on my 1600DP are stuck.

This probably happened last night when I popped a 009 dizzy
into my bus and unsuccessfully attempted to set the 
timing (managed to run it 180 deg out of time with #1 firing
on 180 -- not sure how that can happen, but it can't be good).

So, while I think I've learned my dizzy lessons for the day -- the hard
way -- I'm now facing a stuck valve due to my stupidity. :P

I've checked the archives and haven't found any definitive solution
for unsticking valves, although I did see:

1) use a BFH and &quot;tap&quot; on it -- use a wooden dowel on the valve stem
	(tappig on the spring won't help, right?)

2) put some oil in your gas and run the car -- this will apparently free things up


any other thoughts?  If these fail, am I stuck pulling the head, or...?

thanks again volks.  any thoughts/comments/words of wisdom/encouragement are
welcome.

cheers,
	t
