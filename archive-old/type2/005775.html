Hello all,

&gt; Hi all, this is a Friday kinda thing to do i suppose, but bear with me...
&gt;

This is actually not a Friday thing, this is a never-post-to-the-list thing
since it doesn't involve Bus content.  The list content rules require Bus
content, even on Friday.

My main concern is starting up a Mac vs. PC on the list debate so take the
poll if you like but DO NOT post to the list about Macs or PCs or anything
else not Bus-related.

Besides, I think this thread has been done, check the archives if you are
interested.

Bus content only folks...

&gt; My boss thinks that all Volkswagen drivers use Macintosh computers, we
have
&gt; this ongoing PC vs. Mac debate. Personally, i am a PC guy. Anyway, he
&gt; thinks that since I bought a bus I am going to convert to Macs. I thought
&gt; it would be interesting to create a poll, if you care to cast your vote or
&gt; just look at the results, go to:
