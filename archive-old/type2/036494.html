Subject: drastic reduction in HC and CO

Our 1600 engine failed emissions in Northern Virginia last week.  I then
tuned the 34PICT-3 the usual Bentley way and reset the dwell and timing.
It flunked again. The numbers were almost identical.

I then did a rare thing  -  I left it at the station and had the mechanic
work on it.  It then passed.  Here are the numbers.

                            before           after
HC                      1910            197
CO                      8.10               2.0

Here is his description of his work:              &quot;adjusted the two screws
on the carb and reset the timing.&quot;

This has got me irritated.  Any of us can do the adjustments he did. None
of us can monitor the results and adjust to get the numbers down.  Or can
we?

Two years ago, I paid way too much money for a Berg oxygen sensor, only to
find that the sensor must be inserted into a good sized hole deep within
the exhaust system.  Like in an extractor.  It does not read accurately  if
one merely sticks it into the end of the stock tail pipe.

Has anyone found a way to beat this game?

Jack
