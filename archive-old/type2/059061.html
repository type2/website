Subject: NEW BUSDEPOT WEBSITE!!!!
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I'm very happy, and even more relieved, to announce that the long-awaited
Bus Depot searchable website/database at http://www.busdepot_dot_com is now a
reality!

You can access about 5000 items by simply choosing the year of your bus (or
other VW) and part type on a dropdown menu.  Virtually every item that we
have ever sold even one of of there now, with price, description, and part
number, so no more calling or waiting on hold for pricing!

You can also search the database by Volkswagen, Rocky Mountain Motorworks,
WCM, or (in many cases) Bosch part number, and also by keyword.  Please read
the info on entering keywords and part numbers, as you need to enter them
the way the search engine likes to see them if you want to get back the
desired results.  This search function accesses the same 5000-item database,
and is mainly for use if you couldn't find the part you wanted via the
drop-down menus. Usually you won't even have to use this feature, but it
will be another way of getting at the data just in case.

The shopping cart software is also up now, allowing you to order directly
via the webpage.  It calculates shipping for you, takes your checking info
on a secure server (unless you already have it on file with us, in which
case you need not provide it again), and sends the order right to us for
processing the same or next business day. (One note: There is a minor quirk
in Netscape, hopefully solved tomorrow, where the &quot;view cart&quot; option does
not list all items  that are in your cart.  But when you go to check out, it
will show everything (and give you the option to delete items), so as long
as you're aware of the glitch it doesn't hurt anything.  This glitch does
not appear to occur when using Internet Explorer, and in any event should be
worked out within a day or so.)

Within a few weeks, an additional 7000 items are being added to the
database, including, for example, the entire Bosch catalog as it relates to
Volkswagen.  A few weeks after that, another 7000 mostly-aircooled part
numbers will be added.  These additional 14,000 parts will at first be
accessable only by part number, but if you have a Rocky Mountain Motorworks
catalog (which uses VW part numbers), the number off your old part, or a
helpful local VW parts counter man, getting the part number is a pretty easy
thing.
Gradually, I'll be adding more detailed descriptions on the additional
14,000 items, making search by keyword or application possible.

As promised, I have a bunch of new specials to promote the new site.  One
which just arrived is currently listed in the Hot Items section (under parts
category Exterior &amp; Body Parts).  It is the factory optional rear bumper
impact strip for a '73-79 bus, with clips.  It attaches to any rear bumper
without any modification or drilling, and besides giving the indented part
of your bumper a purpose, may save your bumper if you back into something.
Original dealer price $180, sale price $69.95.  Other specials are on the
Bargains page, accessable from the main page or many other pages of the
site.  The members page probably will not be updated for a little while, so
the Bargains and Hot Items pages will be the ones to check for specials and
new additions.

You guys are now officially my &quot;beta testers.&quot;  :-)  I'm sure lots of minor
quirks and inconsistancies in the database will rear their heads, and I'd
really appreciate it if you'd give the site a workout and let me know what
you find.  If you come across an error on content, please e-mail
sales_at_busdepot_dot_com. If it's an error regarding the way the site works,
navigates, searches, etc., the web developer, bob_at_justcallinc_dot_com, has
requested that you copy him on the e-mail.

The next generation of the site, in the late Fall, will be a little nicer
graphically and will also feature clickable links next to many items, to
show you pictures and provide more detailed descriptions/specs. With
advanced technology such as SQL server and cold fusion, the sky's the limit
as far as the number of items we can add or the ways we can access them.
Still, I'm pretty happy with the way it's shaping up so far.  While a parts
database of this scale has been done on the web before, it has never been
applied to Volkswagen parts.  I believe that a cutting-edge website database
is The Bus Depot's future.  It will enable me to maintain rock-bottom
overhead (and thus rock-bottom pricing) while freeing up personnel to focus
on the things a computer can't do, like customer service and fast shipping.
The new site is a long-overdue first step.  I owe you all heartfelt thanks
for sticking with me as customers when getting through to the Depot to place
an order was challanging, to say the least.

Now that this is done, I'm preparing to leave for Europe to do some serious
parts hunting and *very* badly needed vacationing (in a VW camper we're
renting in the Netherlands).  Evon and Haley have been very patiently
awaiting the completion of this site so we could spend some time together
again, so I owe them this, and besides I have a lead on someone who's
sitting on a bunch of NOS German heater boxes and other goodies :-)  The
Depot will be in the very capable hands of Jerry, Dan, and Mary while I'm
out, so fear not. In fact, considering that most of you will be looking up
prices right on the website, those of you who do need to call or e-mail
should gradually notice fewer and fewer busy signals and faster e-mail
response over the next few weeks.  Of course I'll be in touch with the shop
regularly just in case anyone needs to reach me.

Thanks for your continued support! Go check out the new site! :-)

P.S.  Any list member who orders $150 or more from the new website will get
a free pair of VW van mudflaps, while supplies last. I have 40 pair. They
are N.O.S. from Venezuala, and are black with a white VW emblem.  You must
order via the website, and ask for the free mudflaps when ordering.
