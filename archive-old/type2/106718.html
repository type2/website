Subject: Busted Engine lid-hinge...

Hey guys,

	Another quick question... one of the hinges on my &quot;new&quot; Bus is
busted. The little rod that goes through the hinge seems to have snapped.
What's the easiest way to repair this? Do I hammer the old one out, and
slide a metal dowell in there?


Thanks,
