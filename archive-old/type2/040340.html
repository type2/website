Subject: Help on touch up painting

I've been in the Type 2 library and archives tonight and didn't find much 
about what I needed, but I did find out more than I've been able to with the 
local VW dealer.
Seems I heard that I could give the &quot;paint code&quot; to an authorized VW dealer, 
and they could get the proper touch up paint for me. I've talked to them 
twice  and they don't seem to have a clue. They say that their charts don't 
go back that far. I did find out  here tonight that L 512 is &quot;Velvet Green&quot;. 
The bus I recently bought had a pretty good paint job prior to my purchasing 
it. There are just a couple of small things that keep it from being perfect. 
It does however have a few &quot;paint dings&quot; that I want to fix. These aren't 
dents, just pin head sized areas where the paint has come off. A few of these 
areas have started to rust, so I want to do a proper repair and nip this now. 
My questions are how do I get the right paint? And how do I prep the area(or 
do I)? before applying the paint. Logic tells me that I shouldn't just paint 
over a rust area, even if it's this small, but maybe getting it covered keeps 
it from being exposed and therefore stops the rusting process. All of the 
spots are so small that if I dab the paint on with a very small brush nobody 
would ever notice, but I only want to do that if it's the right thing to do.
Thanks in advance for advice!
