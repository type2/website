I got my gauges from Bus-boys this weekend and intalled them.  Nice to have 
some readings as I break in my new engine.  I am running side by side temp 
gauges now.  The old one sends from the relief valve and the new one sends 
from the dip stick.  The dip stick runs slightly hotter -- I will confirm 
them with boiling water this week.

But as I was routing the wires to the back along the belly I noticed that 
the tube that goes from the oil filler down through the tin just hangs out 
down below.  It has a small hole very close to the end and looks like it 
needs something attached to it?  What am I missing?

My new VDO tach seems possesd.  I know I wired it correctly but not sure if 
I got the 3 dip switches right.  The internal labels (very hard to see) 
don't seem to jive with the instructions.  Maybe the left-to-right 
orientation is wrong?  Anyone had this problem and fixed it?

I can't locate 1971 firewall tin anywhere (bus-boys reccomended Way-Out 
Salvage, but no luck).  Based on catalog drawings it looks like I can drill 
out the spot welds from earlier tin and attach the filler piece to mine.  
Does this seem like a good idea?

Sure would love to find someone with a stock 71 near me so I could crawl 
around underneath and take notes.  I'm in Lathrop, near Stockton, CA.
