Subject: Re: SVDA and Kadrons

I think I owe John Connolly and the list an apology. Shortly after I 
sent out the email John reminded me that a long and very thorough set of 
instructions went out to my work email shortly after I ordered the SVDA. 
For the past couple evenings I've been away from the computer 
doublechecking my work using those instructions and come to find out 
that my problem was sloppy installation of one of the carbs. I had base 
gasket on only one of the studs. My Bus sure runs a lot better now. I 
think I need to fiddle with the carb adjustments some but my cruise down 
to the Karmann Ghia Treffen this weekend is now assured to be more 
pleasurable. Thanks John.

Larry
