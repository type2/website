True!  But in another sense it is being improved upon daily, every time
someone shares their knowledge, experiences and even their opinions.  So
long as opinions are tolerated, please let me offer:

While I think the proposed &quot;BPRS&quot; is unworkable, I have no problem
whatsoever with using the list for the same purpose.

Anyone who is going to be traveling from point A to point B and who worries
they may not make it without breaking down is absolutely welcome to post a
message asking anyone along the route to email their names/numbers in case
they are needed on the road.

Anyone traveling from point A to point B who just wants to socialize with
other list members is welcome to post a message asking anyone along the
route to reply.

Anyone who breaks down on the road is welcome to post a request for help.
As Mark Hineline pointed out, newbys and lurkers should not expect the same
response as regulars on the list.

Anyone is welcome to promote rescue efforts if they know of someone in need
of help (nobody is trying to cut you off, Charlie).

Anyone who has help to offer is encouraged to do so.  For the record, I
have an extra bedroom, carport for repairs, and a collection of metric
tools; all of which have already on one occasion been offered to another
list member.
