To the list,

I know this is out of the bus venue but I was hoping that someone may =
have some feed back on this one.

I'm going to look _at_ an 82 Westy that has a 1.9 turbo diesel with 50k on =
it.
The only thing that I know about the diesel Westy is that they do well =
on fuel &amp; are as slow as the day is long.
So I need advice as if this is something worth considering of just be =
happy with my 71 Westy.

Chris=20

Bus # 5 a 71 Westy

Thank you,
