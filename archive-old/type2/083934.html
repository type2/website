&gt;Regarding tailgating:
&gt;
&gt;Why not rig up a tray under the battery compartments into which you put
&gt;old parts that have no further use.  When you pull a cable the rear edge
&gt;of the tray is released and your old bits drop to the roadway as a gentle
&gt;reminder that it's not a good idea to tailgate behind a bus!

Works for me.  Puts a whole new spin on &quot;recycling&quot;...

And speaking of cables...  The current online catalog of Colemans Surplus [no connection to Coleman as in lanterns, etc.] has a bunch of brand new control cables of different types, in lengths up to 20', for ~$5.00 each.  Could be useful in engineering bus heater or manual choke retrofits, etc.

Go to:   www.colemans_dot_com

Quite a few other items in their catalog that could be of use to an imaginative bus or camper jockey, including brand new 12V blower kits with all sorts of fittings, etc, for ~$10.00...
