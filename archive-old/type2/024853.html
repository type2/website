ok, i guess you've all read about my recent purchase...i'll be traveling to
new york (hopefully) in the new bus next thursday evening.  i'm not sure
what to do with the current one...sell it, or part it out.  i'd rather not
part it out, because the interior and most everything else is in great
shape.  if anyone is interested, it'll probably going for around $500.  if
anyone is interested and wants more info, p-mail me.  but you must act fast,
because there is a guy i work with that is somewhat interested...i doubt
that'll pan out though, as i don't think i could sell it to him for reasons
that i'd rather not get into right now.  also, i might be stealing some
small parts (side mirror, etc.) off of it in the next week...so if anyone is
looking for a (or another) project, drop me a line.  i'd keep it if i had
any room whatsoever to store it in, but i don't living in the city and
all...
