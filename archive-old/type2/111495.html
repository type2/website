Dixie Bus Gathering 2003 Trip Report
Mt Vernon, Ohio

Well Dixie Bus was a fantastic weekend for me. I got the approval from
the wife to make a solo travel for this one, so off Butch and I went.
Friday morning packed up and drove to work as normal. After half a day
of staring at a computer, I saw my chance to bolt and took it. Said
farewell to Brentwood and off I went at 12:30. This was much earlier
than I expected to leave so the trip was already starting fantastic. I
spend the majority of the afternoon cruising 65 and munching on animal
crackers. Got to Louisville and took a right.

While driving the bypass there I saw a baby blue squareback on the side
of the road. I pulled off to offer help. Turns out he has just gotten in
an accident with a Corilla a bit ago. The passenger fender was all
mangled up to the point of not letting the hood unlatch. The fender had
also taken the liberty of removing that pesky compressed air from his
front tire. I gave him a hand getting the hood popped, only to find
another busted spare tire. Since this was a 72 I didn't have a wheel of
the same lug pattern. He had already called a friend, who was on the
way and another friend was there in her Chevy for assistance. I bid my
farewell and took back off down the highway.

Drove a few more hours closing in on Cincinnati. I have never been
there and was very pleased upon setting eyes on it for the first time.
Cinn seems like a fun town, I got quite good vibes just driving through
it. Hopefully I will make it back there sometime to spend some time. On
and on we pushed, stopping for gas occasionally and quick breaks.
Sometime after 9:30 I found the little country church listed in the
directions. I was finally there. Rolling into the camp I easily found
the bus area and pulled in. I was immediately greeted by a familiar
face. Frank and I exchanged greetings and he gave me some directions on
where I could camp (anywhere).

I backed up and pitched camp next to Mark and Bill, who looked a little
beat (from the long drive) but holding up well. The rest of the night
was spent visiting old friends and making new ones. Stayed up late
around the fire and crashed around 2:30.

A good amount of the crew had planned to leave camp at 8:00 to go to the
show. Somehow I managed to be up and ready by that time. So after Wakee,
Wakee eggs and Bakee Frank started the carabus. If you haven't followed
Frank somewhere in a bus, you haven't lived. We flat out FLEW down these
little side roads. I hit 75 a few times just trying to keep up. On the
way we found a little bay window whose pilot was lost. Turns out they
were going to the same place. They fell in line and we all trucked to
the show. Just to get a nicer parking spot I entered Butch and got
parked next to 3 really nice 67's. 

At the show I chatted with some other bus owners. Even met Ted Smith who
has helped me several times on VB list. I walked the swap several times
but didn't find anything I needed, which was good since I didn't bring
much money. Later I found Ted and Troy in the swappers area. Chatted
with them a bit and generally did nothing for many hours. There were
quite a lot of nice cars and busses there, but shows are not exactly my
cup of tea. I prefer camping. After the 50/50 I followed a few people
back to the camp-out. Fortunately one of their wives had written down
directions :)

Back at camp I paid for my plot and setup camp again. After a bit of
work and a bit of beer I was ready for some grub. About 6 Frank rang the
dinner pan and the camp descended on a huge bubbling cauldron of chili.
I've only recently started to eat chili, but his is easily the best I
have ever had. It was worth the 450 mile drive for the chili alone. The
icing on the cake was the keg of Canadian. Spent the rest of the night
visiting even more people, having a few cherries and just having a good
time. I got a good chance to meet many of the OVT which I have not met
before. Had a good time visiting with Keith and his son from the
LEAKOIL chapter of NEATO and lots of other people I can't remember their
names. Had a fantastic time and crashed around midnight.

Morning came a bit later than Saturday morning so I felt quite rested
when I woke up. As the camp started to mill around me and several others
started with the burritos. Frank reluctantly got pulled in to manage,
however it was clear he wasn't taking any prisoners. His battle cry that
morning was &quot;now, if your scared just say so&quot;. Even while pouring 5
dozen eggs in a pot, the man didn't flinch. While cooking 5 lbs of
bacon at once didn't bat an eye. Yes the pillar of a man Frank Biffath
rode tall that morning. Which was amazing since he had worked his rear
off the entire weekend, making sure everyone had a fantastic time. About
10 I rolled out of camp after saying my good byes and was back on the
road.

Drove through some rain here and there in Ohio but nothing for very
long. Unfortunately my wind shield still leaks, but what's new? The rest
of the trip back south was a nice drive. Arrived in Dickson around 7:30
and got greeted by 4 smiling faces who seemed very happy Daddy was back. 

I want to thank Frank Biffath for putting on a very nice camp-out. This
was my first one that was not one of the huge outings. Very nice and
personal. There wasn't one second I didn't have a good time. I plan on
being there again next year, so watch out.
