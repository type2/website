Subject: Long trip advice

&gt;im bran new to the list!  My girlfriend and I have been planning a cross
&gt;country trip for a couple of months now and are planning to leave in
&gt;June.  We will be doing alot of camping and backpacking so we wanted to
&gt;get some insight or suggestions as to the essential things we would need
&gt;to take with us.  Not only for the bus but for ourselves as well.  We
&gt;plan to travel for awhile and have become overwhelmed with the things we
&gt;are taking with us.  We also have our two dogs, so suggestions for them
&gt;would also be appreciated.  Again any advice from anyone who has done
&gt;this or traveled for awhile would be fantastic! Thanks for the help and
&gt;the insight

 Yes, less is more.  Try to resist the urge to bring ALL of the comforts of
 home with you, remember, you're roughing it. (somewhat)   You can always
 pick up things you wish you had brought along the way.  Folding chairs, a
card table, and some kind of shade are awesome.  Use your head on food,
don't carry a lot of perishables at one time.

 If you are not a regular backpacker, state of the art equipment costs
several times as much as cheaper stuff (Walmart, etc) but is infinitely more
comfortable.

Take about twice as much cash (in travellers cheques, of course) as you feel
 you should.  You'll be surprised how many businesses don't take Visa when
 you are in the &quot;sticks&quot;.  Also, make sure you've got plenty of &quot;room&quot; left
 on your cards, you will end up spending much more than originally planned.

 Plan on a motel every now and then. (On a trip more than three or so weeks,
two  or less if you're not used to camping, I promise, you'll end up staying
in one whether it was planned or not.)

 If you don't now, start taking your dogs in vehicles as much as possible
between now and the time of your trip.  And remember, they probably won't
 enjoy your adventure as much as you will.

 Spare parts?  Who knows what you might need?  Maybe nothing, maybe a parts
 bus towed behind.  Murphy would say you will always need what you didn't
 bring.  Its most important to check out everything you can before you
 leave(or pay a mechanic to).  Then check again what you can on every stop.
 Drive your bus enough before your trip to know what things sound like-and
 investigate new sounds as soon as they begin.  You may want to bring Ron's
 (Bus Depot) phone number with you, I'm sure he'll next day air something
you
 can't find locally.  (Don't count on finding bus specific parts at a FLAPS,
 even ones that specialize in foreign vehicles.  Unless there are lots of
 buses in the area, they won't have parts for your 2L.)

 Most importantly-long trips are hard on you.  Resist the urge to choke the
 life out of each other when the desire arises-and always remember how you
 felt about each other the day you left!  Try to get as much rest as
possible, and if you are both tired, don't be afraid to ask for directions.

 Lastly, not everyone loves pets.  Not everyone loves YOUR pets.  It may be
 cute to you for Fido to stick his nose in someone's crotch, but that person
 may be on the verge of a cardiac arrest.  (some people are terrified of
 dogs-whether a 150 lb great dane or a teacup poodle)  You may not think it
a
 big deal that Fido peed on the motorhome in the next slot's tire, but the
 guy that paid 300 grand for it and washes it every day may think it the
 biggest deal.  The person that detests dogs, the one whose child is
horribly
 allergic to them, and the campers that just shelled out 400 bucks to kennel
 their pets while on the first vacation they've had in 15 years, WILL NOT
 think your dogs are cute, so please, don't let them run loose. (in other
words, pet owners that carry their animals on trips are usually extremely
inconsiderate of us that don't or no longer carry pets on trips---don't be
like them)   Also, not
 all camping areas allow pets, so make sure yours will be allowed in each
 one before you leave.

 Good luck, hope you have fun.
