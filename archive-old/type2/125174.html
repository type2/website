Subject: Re: Cylinder head probs

Todd:

Yes it is possible to pull the head without dropping the engine.  I 
wouldn't recommend it.  To do it properly, you will also have to remove 
the fan housing otherwise you will wind up having to bend some of the 
engine tin to get the head off.  Also remember that if you do decide to 
pull the head with the engine in the bus, all of the work will be done 
on your back unless you have access to a lift.

In my opinion it is easier to pull the engine and work on it on the 
bench or stand.
