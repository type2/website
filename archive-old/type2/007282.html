Sorry if this gets posted twice, but f%^&amp;$ AOL dropped me as hit send on the first attepmt.I can't resist putting my .02 in on this. I,too, have a bus with a 1.8 and the (in)famous Weber 32/36 carb. I have also experienced the slow warm up in cold weather, in fact sometimes it won't warm up at all,and the choke will keep kicking the idle up. I'm taking a welding class, and have my own mig welder, and one of my first projects is going to be fabricating an air cleaner with breather and preheat connections, and pitch that silly little chrome thing with the paper element.This may take a few weeks, but I'll post the results when I'm done.   Jeff
