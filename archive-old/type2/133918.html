Subject: Re: [T2] Westy/Screen in pop top

Looking forward to an answer on this one.

The screens in my Sportsmobile are completely gone, and I'd like to
hear if there's a reasonable way to add screens back in.

Some cue to the material on Sportsmobile pop-ups would also be
appreciated.  I personally can't tell if it's coated canvas or some
sort of vinyl.  I've got a few surface cracks and a couple small holes
to repair also.
- Hide quoted text -

&gt; Any list members dealt with this problem? Is there a way to replace the
&gt; screen? (Its sewn in to the canvas at the bottom)
&gt; Would appreciate any information from list members, as to a fix for this.
&gt;

- Dean

(sorry for the duplicate, Tom.)
