Subject: Re: [T2] Light Question

Normal for the alternator light.  Engine has to trigger the alternator 
circuit that sends the D+ signal.  Usually an initial engine rpm must be 
reached to activate.

&gt; Evening, all-
&gt;
&gt; I just noticed this quirk. When I stat up on warm mornings and the 
&gt; engine
&gt; idles low for a minute or two, the alternator light stays on until the 
&gt; revs
&gt; come up. That is expected. What I noticed is the the little 'B' brake
&gt; circuit light also stays on and then goes off when the alternator light
&gt; does. Is this typical, or normal? Does this indicate that the brake 
&gt; light is
&gt; hooked up wrong?
&gt;
&gt; Just wondering,
