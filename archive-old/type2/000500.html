Hey there type-2ers,

Here is the latest progress report on my new bus.  The side door was jammed
shut and I didn't know why. I took the door apart and found a cable that ran
from the latch at the back of the door to the latch at the front. It was
rusted solid. I worked it loose and tried to get as much Marvel Mystery Oil
in it as I could. put it back together and know it works fine!

Thanks,

Kevin Sullivan
