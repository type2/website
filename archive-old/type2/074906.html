Subject: Re: [T2] another emissions question

The type IV 2000cc engines tend to oveheat and drop valve seats if you
lean them out too much. I just shoot for spark plug burn that is the
color of coffee with cream and I've never lost a head in seven years.
Please note this exception;  the original heads had detonation damage and
both had intake and exhaust seats dropped in additioin the had cracks and
leaked. They were actualy still running but not rebuildable when I pulled
it down and rebuilt the top end.

&gt; Hi Folks,
&gt; 
&gt; Here in the mountains of Colorado they only do the tailpipe test, 
&gt; and I 
&gt; managed to pass my 79 Westy by changing the fuel/air mixture.  I 
&gt; drove it on 
&gt; the highway for 15-20 min to get it hot, then parked it a block away 
&gt; from 
&gt; the inspection station.  I leaned out the mixture with the AFM screw 
&gt; until 
&gt; it barely ran, drove it down the block, and it passed with flying 
&gt; colors.  
&gt; The inspection guy even said, &quot;Wow, I've never seen a VW that runs 
&gt; so 
&gt; clean.&quot;  I paid him, drove on, reset the mixture, and have had no 
&gt; worries.  
&gt; Granted, I'm not being very environmentally friendly, but now I'm 
&gt; rebuilding 
&gt; my engine, so my Bus is currently a Zero-Emissions vehicle.
&gt; 
&gt; Good luck to all who have to pass more stringent emissions tests...
&gt; 
&gt; Jason
