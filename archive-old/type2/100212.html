Subject: Re: [T2] 71 Westy Wiper Arm Removal question

    Mine was stuck pretty bad too so I used a small two arm puller on it.  I 
put the little hooks of the arms on either sider of the wiper arm base, and 
the center screw part of the puller right on the end of the stud that goes 
through the middle of the base.  It pulled right off like that.
