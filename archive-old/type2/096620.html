Subject: NEW 2002 baywindow buses

Along the lines of this thread: Didn't someone say that the going rate for these new 2002 buses was about 19K, not including overseas delivery? For that kind of bread you could almost get TWO beautiful completely restored original bay window buses that are every bit as good as new, probably better if they consist of all german parts! So why not go this route and not worry about doing the jail time. I have heard stories about what they to do to long-haired boys like myself in jail, and I want no part of that! That is why they call jail the &quot;Pokey&quot; ;^)
