&gt; when my bus shook like that, I didn't have the clutch disk properly
aligned
&gt; with the transmission shaft.  After I lined it up correctly, it was as
&gt; smooth as silk.

That statement's a puzzler to me.  &quot;Alignment&quot; of the clutch disk simple
allows the transmission shaft to slip through the center hole of the disk
easily when mating transmission to engine.  If you've got your transmission
mated to the engine the disk is &quot;aligned&quot; as much as it ever could be
because there's no radial movement of the disk possible at that point.
