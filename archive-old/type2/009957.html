Subject: Not using U-Pipes on 78 exhaust
Message-Id: &lt;199906241136.HAA12066_at_mime3.prodigy_dot_com&gt;

Re apparent unavalability of U-Pipes betweem manifold and heat exchangers:
If you can't get the U-pipes, a local guru  (very resectable mechanic/body
worker) clued me in that using a manifold/heatexchanger from an earlier bus
(he has a 74) would fit OK to the later 78 heads, but you have to get the
early muffler also, with the 4 connections for the heater/manifolds.  He
said the only reason they went to the separate manifold/upipes/heaterbox
(read more places to leak) was to accomodate the insertion of the catalytic
for California.   Ron Salmon verified this should work, having gotten it
&gt;from AVP
