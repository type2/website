Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Fuel injector Question

&gt; Both injectors you mention have a flow rate 18.1 lb/hr at 37 psi. So - the
&gt; odd one may work just fine.
&gt; This web site has a list of injector specs:

Ed,
Interesting.  I wrote to suggest that he should replace the Beetle injector
figuring that if the Vanagon is a 2.0L engine and the Beetle a 1.6L engine,
the Beetle injector would not flow enough fuel.  However if the flow rate is
the same, maybe it doesn't matter.

&gt;
&gt; Usually a vacuum leak will cause you to run lean, not rich. Doesn't the
'81
&gt; have an oxy sensor involved in the FI system?

Only the CA model '81s have oxygen sensors.

&gt; pressure regulator - it lowers fuel pressure at higher vacuum so *this*
&gt; vacuum leak *could* cause a rich condition.

Ooh, good call :-)
