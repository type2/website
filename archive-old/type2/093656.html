Subject: Re: [T2] was engine sonversion, now stupid mistake

Zack,

There is a guy in Bensenville that makes Boston Bob look
kindergardener---
And all he does is aluminum engines---big dollar stuff---
Massarati's, Porsche, Bentley, Rolls, VW's, on and on--the whole place
is nothing but aluminum---
Very resonable---as well as knowlegable--

I took my heads over there. and he stopped waht he was doing popped my
valves out, and told me, as well as showed me right away what I needed--

I told him I wanted it right--so he gave me the best stuff available---

For what Bob wanted for a pair of cobbed up heli coiled heads, Bill at
Apex did mine--trick valves, all new hardened seats, all new phosperous
bronze guides, and a set of rings--for a third of the price. 

A word to the wise---stay as close to home as you can when it comes time
to get machine work done---On-line stuff sucks--big time 

You'll have to do the grunt work though---drop the engine, dissasemble
it, and get it there--

Bill _at_
Apex Engineering
224 So. Evergreen Ave.
Bensenville IL.
630-766-7168

If you need any more info--let me know--
I'll be glad to help--

Later,

Terry

i have weighed the options, and i think you guys are right. it would
cost me the cost of the engine plus some new parts plus installing
everything, which is probably way over my head. i have driven a 1978
with a 1641cc and looking back i like the power of the 2000cc much more.
now my dilema is getting my engine rebuilt. are any of you from the
chicago-land area. i am now looking for a place to have my engine
rebuilt. i would be willing to drive a little to get there as long as it
is a good place, and what is the ball park cost of a rebuild for a 2000
FI. thanks for your imput, it cleareda few things up for me.
