&gt; &gt;problem is when I went out Wed last to a place I use regularly to get the
&gt; &gt;front end aligned, (Hunter electronic, even had the spec's in the computer
&gt; &gt;for her)  They could not get the left front all the way to spec, very
&gt; &gt;close only off by 1' but that was as far as the eccentric would go.
&gt; &gt;I checked out all of the reused components and everthing was to spec...so
&gt; &gt;this has got me really scratching my head.
&gt; 
&gt; One degree negative is OK ( i like more ).

that is one &quot;minute&quot; beyond the max reccomended negative camber

&gt; A rudimentary check can be achieved with a two-foot level,
&gt; vehicle on level ground, place level against rim and measure the
&gt; amount from the rim out to the level, 1/4 &quot; is about a degree of camber.

well actually used a $100,000 computer machine

&gt; I doubt if you have the tools to check for a bent spindle.
