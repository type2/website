Subject: Heater Pipe

Now might be a good time to install an in-line booster fan of the bilge 
blower type.  It has helped with heating my bus, but it sure is noisy.  
I have a three-speed switch and usually keep it on the slower speeds to 
keep from hearing the fan, which sounds like a blow-dryer.
