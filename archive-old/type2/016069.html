&lt;&lt; Next step is to clean of my pistons, cylinders, and heads that are coated
with carbon deposits.  Muir says to scrape with a boyscout knife, I didn't
find this to be too fast.  I have a parts cleaner with some neato solvent, but
that's not much better.  What does everyone else do? &gt;&gt;
  The parts cleaner is a big help.  I usually pull out the tray in the bottom
of my parts cleaner an let the pistons soak over night.  Then I do the scrub a
dub dub gig with a soft brass brush.  After the major gunk is removed I clean
them up with a gray scotch brite pad.  As for the ring grooves, I have an
honest to goodness piston ring groove cleaning tool.  But when I can find
it--hey it happens- I use a busted piston ring and a plastic wheel on my
dremal tool.  BTW the dremal kicks butt on the inside of heads!  Be sure to
reweigh your pistons and run  a glaze breaker through your  jugs before
installation.
  
   Peace, Love, and there is also two different thickness' of rings-take an
old one with yea- or mic them before hand,
        Mr. Bubble Head
