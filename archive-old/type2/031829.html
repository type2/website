&gt; Hey guys the original exhaust on my 77 just gave up. 
&gt; Lost the muffler somewhere mid ohio today...any how
&gt; which is the best style exhaust available...?  I am
&gt; sure the orig is best and it is super expensive with
&gt; all those parts.  They have a stock replacement that
&gt; is one unit.  Do they work well?  Header system looks
&gt; crappy to me....but does it work and ???$$$

actually I backdated my 78 to the older 73-75 exhaust which is compatable
with 76-78 and is a lot better quality and is cheaper.

now you do have to change the exhaust header and heater box though, I
lucked out and found a good header and don't use the stock heat system so
didn't want the orginal but there are folks who will swap

Ron at Bus Depot has a stainless muffler that beats any stock muffler for
the bus but it doesn't fit the 76-78 model, but is actually cheaper than
the flimsy stock unit and is identical in design

as always YMMV
