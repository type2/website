Subject: T1 engine question

Dear list,
Could anyone with a '71 or earlier bus (or any year bug) tell me what makes
the T1 engine ring/resonate like an electric bell, especially under
acceleration. I said &quot;ring&quot;, not &quot;ping&quot; and I hope they are indeed
different... It strikes me as a familiar sound for someone who has been
around veedubs for a while, but not *all* bugs or early busses are
&quot;equipped&quot; with it.
Thank you,
Sami
