No, you must use a transister ign coil. Got a wrecking yard near you? Any
80-84 Audi or VW with electronic ign will work.

Are the plugs new or do they just 'look ok'?  Missing under a load is
usually plugs.....either wrong # or resistor or platinum resister or [I have
had lots of problems with these] NGK.
W8CC Bosch seem to work the best for me.

&gt; The Vanagon is stumbling and missing under load, but it idles nicely and
&gt; has pickup until about 2600 RPM. If this was a *real* van (like my '71)
&gt; I would suspect points or condenser. But, the Vanagon has a Hall
&gt; distributor. Plugs, wires, cap and rotor all look OK, clean under the cap,
&gt; rotor checks out on the multimeter. Coil checks out but is marginal.
&gt; Would a bad coil cause this kind of stumble? Can I use a regular 12 Volt
&gt; coil to test it, or must I use a special coil for the Hall distributor?
