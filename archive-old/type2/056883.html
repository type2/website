Subject: Re: Temp Sensor - Sump Plate.

&gt;I bought a sump plate that purported to be for the T4 engine (78 Bus).  It
&gt;looks like a 'nose' has been added to the plate with a single 'nostril'
&gt;for holding the sensor.  However, even without the sensor installed, I
&gt;couldn't get it to go into place.  The 'nose' would always bang against
&gt;the dipstick.  I think I might be able to trim a piece of the dipstick
&gt;off.  But I was wondering if this was standard procedure.  This sump plate
&gt;came with an addition plate to help protect the sender where it comes out.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Any thoughts?  Do I have the wrong part?

You have the right part.  You will have to cut the end of your dipstick off
to use it.  You will still have plenty of range on the dipstick to get the
proper reading.

Just one more proof that the dipstick sender is at the same location as the
sump sender.  :-)
