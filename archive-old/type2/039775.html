Wait!!! Come back!!!  Wrong button!!!

As I was saying, you will eventually need deep sockets.  Keep your eyes open
for a deal on a full set.  Just remember that a deep socket will not take the
torque of a shallow one.

Universal sockets? Crowsfoots?  I got 'em.  Can't remember the last time I
used one.  Save your money.  Use it to buy something really good.  Like
Snap-on screwdrivers.  That's the one place that I think that the premium
price is really worth it.  Cheap screwdrivers just screw UP screws.  Buy the
best you can afford and use the cheap ones as chisels and can openers.

Comment on Sears tools...  Decent tools, lousy plating.  The chrome peels and
slices you just like a razor. I'll never buy another Craftsman tool.  What I
save in Band-aids pays for the upgrade to Snap-on. 

Usual disclaimers&gt;&gt;&gt; YMMV, IMHO, FWIW, TANSTAAFL
