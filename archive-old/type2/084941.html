Subject: Re: [T2] Type4 distributor question:

Sounds like the distributor isn't engaging in the drive.

Loosen the clamp on the distributor body and try to reseat it. It will only 
seat in one position - there will be another position 180 degrees out that 
will feel like it MIGHT seat but it won't.

&gt;I have finally gotten around to troubleshooting the old 77 bus that quit a 
&gt;couple of months back while the kid was driving it. The bus had been 
&gt;acquired a couple weeks before and hadn't yet done a tune-up, oil change 
&gt;or other mandatory servicing prior to him drive it.
&gt;
&gt;The symptoms, when it gave up the ghost:  Shifting from 2nd to 3rd, it 
&gt;backfired (it blew the muffler apart from the clamp and pipe), let out
&gt;a huge puff of black smoke, quit and persistently refusad to restart. I 
&gt;had at the time assumed an eaten valve or such, but didnt have time until 
&gt;now to get into it.
&gt;
&gt;While recharging the battery out of the rig, (I read in Idiots that one 
&gt;should not jump start a fuel injected motor) I started with the basics of 
&gt;troubleshooting I checked the points, cap and rotor. Satisfactory gap. 
&gt;However, and now I'll finally get to the question.....
&gt;
&gt;The distributor rotor shaft turns around by hand. In fact, it lightly 
&gt;&quot;snaps&quot; into &quot;place&quot; every 180 degrees. This does not happen with my T1 
&gt;motor's distributor - the shaft only turns when the starter turns it.
&gt;
&gt;Is this normal, and if not, what is wrong?? bad Dist? broken cam? stripped 
&gt;distributor gear???
&gt;
&gt;Tomorrow the battery should be up to full charge and can tell if it turns 
&gt;over and the rotor  turns when the motor turns over.
&gt;
&gt;help..
