Subject: oil filter cross reference

Howdy,

Not sure if this is exactly the same, but a buddy of
mine had a problem with his oil filter rubbing his
exhaust and causing all sorts of problems, and an old
VW mechanic said that the oil filter off of a Rabbit
would fit the threads and seal up well, and also is
longer and more narrow.  He's used this setup for
about five years.  Unsure of what year Rabbit,
unfortunately.
