Subject: Engine Carrier Bolts

The upper bolts are larger than the lower bolt.  I can't speak to the
depth, but I remember that I have had to add spacers in the past due to
bolts bottoming out.  I also had to add spacers to make up for the shorter
helicoils in my Mexican engine (it comes with helicoils from the factory).

As long as you have several threads in engagement it will be fine.

&gt; Can someone tell me if the three bolts holding the engine (1600 DP) to
&gt; the carrier should all be the same size?  A PO had replaced the two
&gt; upper bolts with larger standard size bolts.
