Subject: RE: [T2] Dipstick boot

It's a pretty tight fit. I removed and reinstalled mine when I R&amp;R'ed the
fan housing. If you're trying to do it with the engine in place you could
maybe try removing the fan, removing some rear tin, then loosening the fan
housing (4 bolts behind the fan) enough to lift the right side up far enough
to slip the new one on. Maybe someone else has a better idea?

Hi volks-
Can anyone explain to me the procedure for changing the dipstick boot on my
'73 Westy?
Cheers,
Matthew
