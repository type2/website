&gt; Or just don't mess with them, they are probably fine anyway.  If the engine
&gt; is not grossly dirty inside but has sat and the lifters are noisy, another
&gt; trick, drain the oil and fill with 10W straight if you can still find it or
&gt; Dexron ATF.  Run it for maybe 4-5 15 minute idle runs sitting while cooling
&gt; a half hour in between.  Drain and fill with new oil (NEVER Quaker State on
&gt; a VW hydraulic lifter and I will always stand by that) and see if they are
&gt; not quiet.

John:
Good advice and nice post on the previous FI lines subject too!
However, I think you should add to change the oil filter after draining
the ATF-10w oil. In my experience this shouldn't be too hazardous to the
engine if all you do is warm it up and then drain the oil: DON&quot;T DRIVE
IT or load the engine in any way. Also this applies only to gas engines
as diesels have lots higher bearing loadings at idle (but diesels are on
another list).
