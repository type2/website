Subject: Engine oil leak
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

I have taken my engine out of my '75 bus to change my cylinder head. This 
engine is leaking oil all over the place especially the right side. Are there 
any seals on the right side of the engine that I should check for the leak? 
Please advice me on where I should check and change the seals for the whole 
engine before I put it back into the bus. Thanks
