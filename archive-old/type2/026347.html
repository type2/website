But if you insist on converting an aircooled VW into a watercooled one, how
about scrounging yourself a dual-belt fan pulley off a smog-pumped Bus,
buying a water pump for an American car (a FLAPS advertising circular lists
them as &quot;starting at $16.98&quot;) and using that to run the water system?

This unfortunately defeats the purpose of the extra cooling by adding extra
load to the engine, which =  added BTU.  An electric pump is the only way I
can think of to bypass this problem.  If you were to use a full-sized
mechanical pump, Moroso makes an electrically driven one for drag-racing
V-8's.
