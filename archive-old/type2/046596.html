Any, well, most, point plate(s) will do. If you have a plate 
from a regular Bosch/VW distributor, one with vacuum 
and centrifugal advance, you can see that it consists 
of two plates on top of eachother, the top one can be 
moved by the vacuum advance. You can remove this top 
plate, and you'll see that the bottom one also has the 
holes to mount the points, and looks very similar to the 
009 plate, it could even be identical to it. The hole for the 
screw is there, but is not tapped yet, you'll have to do that, 
I think it is M4 thread, the plate is very soft, and I've managed 
to 'tap' it with a hard bolt with the same threads as the point 
set screw. 

I've also used sheet metal screws, like the ones used in 
computers to mount a harddisk, and tightened the points with 
them, not a permanent fix, but will hold the points in place for 
a while.

Hope it helps,

Brian


&gt;anyone has a dead 009 laying around and wants to get
&gt;rid of the plate that the points mount on, please
&gt;let me know how much you want for it and how soon
&gt;you can send it.  If you're anywhere near SoCal, 
&gt;I'd be willing to come pick it up too, if that's ok.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Essentially, I hope to eventually put the original 
&gt;vacuum advance distributor (that came in a parts box 
&gt;with the bus) back in the bus, but i'm not ready to 
&gt;go and do all that now, so I'd like to get the bus up 
&gt;and running again and hopefully without putting too much 
&gt;money into the 009 (otherwise I'd consider buying a new one).
&gt;
&gt;thanks,
