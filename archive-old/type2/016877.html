&gt; John,
&gt; Thanks for that posting, I found it very humorous,

hey - thanks Everett - i figured the one person boycott was the best way to go
- i had considered setting myself on fire, or maybe a hunger strike - but i was
brought up a catholic and not a Buddhist so fire was out - and it is just not
the season for a hunger strike, besides,  ive now got  enough spam to feed the
northern hemisphere :)

so do you mean that my meagre 2 or 3 hits / month may have counted for 100's
or even 1000's - great - i am happy that i choose the boycott route over the
emaciated human torch form of protest

and thanks as well for all the info on your web site - the 62 owner's manual is
great - it seems almost %100 applicable to my 60 standard
