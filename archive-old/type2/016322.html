Subject: &quot;weld thru primer&quot;

&quot;You might also invest in some weld thru primer for all you welds.  The
industry is somewhat split on this stuff because of cost (about 20 bucks a
can) but if your gonna drive your bus forever, sound-rust free welds are a
comforting thought 20 years from now.&quot;

Hello all,
My questions about weld thru primer:
1. Why is it I have never heard of this stuff? Should I get out more?
2.  If this stuff will keep welds rust free for 20 years, why not use it for
     the entire undercarriage, everywhere rest may attack?
3. Where do I go to get some? I am planning to make major cosmetic upgrades
    to my bus and rust prevention is a MAJOR consideration.
Thank you,
Bob
