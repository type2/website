Look for a Safelite Auto Glass franchise in your area, if any.  About $100
installed, and if they break it it's their problem. I don't know where they
get them that cheap, but it's cheaper than I can get them.  I have seen
almost as low prices (under $150 installed) from a handful of other glass
places as well.

&gt; I was looking for some advice on where to buy a new windshield
&gt; from. The price in Rocky MM seemedreasonable $149
&gt; but they wanted $30 for packing charges plus truck charges.
