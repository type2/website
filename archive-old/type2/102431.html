Subject: Extra wire on Positive battery necessary '72?

I have a '72 Canadian Westy.

There is a fairly heavy gauge wire (red with white stripe) going from 
the positive terminal of the battery to the &quot;dealer diagnosis wiring 
block thing&quot; about 14 inches away from the battery mounted on top of 
the engine compartment.

The wire at the battery end is severely corroded.  Can I just remove 
this wire altogether?  It doesn't appear useful for anything other 
than the dealer wiring block.
