Hello all
Collie is a friend of mine and after I notified him about what had happened
he assured me that is was an honest mistake. He didn't even realize he had
sent this piece of mail until I notified him.
I believe booting him from the list was perhaps a little hasty and that upon
further investigation it would have been pretty clear he is not a spammer.
Just an honest mistake.
