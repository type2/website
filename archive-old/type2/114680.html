Subject: Towing a Campermobile with a Vanagon?

Hi folks, I am going to cross-post this to the Vanagon group as well, 
but I really need an answer and it seems like both places are good for 
this due to experiences we've all had:

I have a 1984 Vanagon (1.9 L water-cooled engine, 4 speed manual) &amp; I 
plan to tow a 1977 VW Camper (high top) from pasadena to Phoenix. Can I 
do it with my vanagon? UHaul says my Vanagon lacks the &quot;weight&quot; to pull 
the camper. I doubt them because they can be idiots about some things 
(no offense to any listee working for Big Orange). So, Can I do it?

Thanks in advance!
