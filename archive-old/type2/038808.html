&gt; I'm in the process of rebuilding my steering box for my 71 bus. As you may

&gt; ajusting it. Ajustment of the peg bearing is easily done following the
&gt; Bentley as it is for the worm gear bearing with the shims. But ajustment of
&gt; the screw is impossible du to a possible play between the peg and the worm
&gt; gears. At a certain point, there is no play. But in an other position the
&gt; play is terrible.

The worm gear is machined to only be &quot;tight&quot; in the center position.  If
you turn it either way, the play is supposed to be larger.  This makes it
much easier to machine the worm, as the tolerance is critical only in one
place.  Excessive play isn't important away from the center position as
the steering forces hold the peg to one side or the other.
