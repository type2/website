Subject: Re: [T2] stock vs aftermarket exhaust.


There are a few routes you can take depending on where you are trying to
get. I personally am a fan of the stock exhaust stsyems. All of the
aftermarket extractor/quiet pac/monza style systems I have bought were
cheap. Both in price and quality. If I were in your shoes I would consider
getting the Stainless Steel setup from Bust Depot. I think  you will have
to go to earlier (72-77?) heat exchangers but I have heard lots of good
talk about this system. You will find it hard to get some of the stock '78
stuff but the earlier parts are pretty easy to come by. It all depends on
how shot your heat exchangers are. If they are in good shape you can
probably save some dough by just replacing the elbows and muffler. Try Bus
Boys Inc. for prices too.
     One last peice of advice for they novice exhaust enthusiast. If you
are going to remove the entire system including the manifolds from the
heads be very careful with the 8 nuts (4 on each head) which hold the
manifolds to the head. If your exhaust is that rusty these fasteners are
likely to be toast. If you break a stud here it can be very tricky to fix
without dismantling the motor. Use lots of your favorite Liquid Wrench/
Holy Water and soak them overnight.

Good morning list.
    My name is Brennan, I'm 17, I am fairly new to the list, and to the
wonderful world of Volkswagens as a whole.  I just bought my first bus, a
1978 Westy Champagne edition auto trans. with 124,080 miles.  The engine
was
rebuilt about 20,000 miles ago.  I am currently saving for a new one.  The
bus interior is in fantastic shape and looks as though it has never been
camped.
    The first problem I am going to tackle is the exhaust.  It is very
loud,
It is the stock system.  The whole system seems to be fused together in
some
way.  It almost looks as though it was welded together.  Is this common
practice?  I thought it came in all those parts so you could replace
individual parts as needed.  Anyway, I am not even going to mess with it, I

am going for the whole new system.  I was wondering what the drawbacks were

of an aftermarket extractor system were.  Or should I just go for a new
stock
system?  And also what exactly does an extractor system do?  I know this
question may sound very amateur but that is what I am.  So please take it
easy on me.

Thanks,
Brennan
78 Westy.
