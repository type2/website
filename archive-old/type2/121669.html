&gt; Here is a picture of the dash of my 76. Under the radio there are two

&gt; manual.
&gt; Does anyone know if these are stock and what they are?

Those look like LEDs, not light bulbs.  They are not stock.  Your guess 
as to what they are for would be as good as mine.  You'll probably have 
to just trace the wires.
