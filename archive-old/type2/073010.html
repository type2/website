Subject: Re: Bosh AL82X Altenator hook up


&gt;The 1600dp has a bosh AL82X altenator on it. I have no idea where to
&gt;hook the wires.

From the + battery post, one big wire goes to the starter solenoid. Another
one from the + battery post to the bolt-on connector on the alternator. The
threaded post thing. There must be an insulating washer between this
connection and the case of the alternator otherwise the battery will ground
into the engine case and this will cause an unpleasant but spectacular
light show.

Now you've fixed the route the alt uses to send legions of happy whistling
electrons into the battery, where they reside when not employed elsewhere.

Then, the push-on spade connector goes all the way up front by some
circuitous route and ends up attached to the red idiot light.

But it sounds like you have it hooked up this way already, in essence. What
do you mean when you say the alt becomes a big magnet? Does it charge or
not?
