Subject: timing and overheating, effects of

Please don't set your timing by ear.  Detonation doesn't have to be bad
enough to hear for it to destroy an engine.  I hate to bring bad news but
you've very likely ruined your engine.  Rings seldom work well after they've
been badly overheated.  And even worse,  the exhaust valves usually break
off pretty soon after they have been as hot as you describe.  It's MUCH
cheaper to overhaul an engine just before it drops a valve that to wait
until just after.
