&gt; 1972 Westy, chassis number 232 204 7025.  New rear brake cylinders and pads.
&gt; 
&gt; I have the drums off both rear wheels and the e-brake cables disconnected.  I'm looking at the passenger-side rear wheel.  The e-brake cable lever is an articulated two-piece arrangement, held together and also to the rear (on the passenger side wheel) brake shoe by a pin and a horseshoe clip.  It resembles an upside-down &quot;L&quot;, with a pivot point where the two legs meet, which is pinned to the rear brake shoe.  The top leg of the upside-down &quot;L&quot; connects the two brake shoes and is the part that forces the front brake pad into the brake drum (when the e-brake cable is pulled).  The part of the lever that is pinned to the front brake shoe (passenger side again) is a sideways &quot;U&quot; into which a pin fits (also held in place by a horseshoe).  To actuate the spreading of the brake pads, the e-brake cable pulls the e-brake lever, which pivots on the rear brake pad (passenger side) which puts pressure on the front brake shoe and forces it into the brake drum (at least that is the way i!
t !
&gt; looks like it should work to me).
&gt; 
&gt; With the parts I have, and the e-brake cables disconnected, I can pull the e-brake lever where the e-brake cable connects, until it stops at the axle hub and it physically cannot be pulled any further.  At this point the  &quot;U&quot; has about a 1/2 inch gap from the pin that would cause the front brake pad to actually move.  

do you have the &quot;spreader&quot; bar in place???  this is a piece of metal about
6-7 inches long with slots in the end that fit into the small slots in the
brake shoes.  without these the parking brake will never pull up tight.
