Subject: Re: [T2] Vac Tester for Brake Booster

&gt;   I just read how to test the brake booster. My question is where do I
hook
&gt; up the vac tester on the motor. I have a '79 FI/2.0L w/Calif emissions.
&gt; Anyway heres the problem, I replaced both rear wheel brake cylinders,
bleed
&gt; the whole brake system with new brake fluid. I been driving for a while
now,
&gt; but one day I decided to pump the pedal 2 times and when I did I had real
&gt; strong braking power. I don't know if its hydraulic or vacuum. The system
&gt; appears to be working. I have to only pump twice to get more braking
power.
&gt; The engine idles fine, so I am guessing that maybe I have a collapsed hose
&gt; somewhere or even the check valve is broke.  Any comments or suggestions
&gt; will be greatly appreciated.

This sounds like you don't have the rear shoes adjusted correctly. The
travel of the master cylinder stops as soon as the front disc brakes are
completely engaged. If the rear shoes have too much clearance, they will not
come out far enough to stop the bus. When you pump the pedal, you are taking
up the clearance. This will make the rear shoes reach the drums and give you
four wheel braking.

Pumping the pedal uses up your vacuum and decreases assist. Normally, the
vacuum does not come back quick enough, so this means you don't have a check
valve or vacuum booster hose problem.
