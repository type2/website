Subject: Rapid deterioration of fuel lines.

In mid-trip (in a bug, darnit!) I was confronted with a dripping fuel
line between the fuel pump and the carb.  

I replaced these lines two years ago, which isn't exactly a huge amount
of time.  I normally replace these every two years, but I always
thought of this as being nicely paranoid, not pushing the failure
curve!

The failed line was heavily cracked around the ends, very scary.

The replacement line was the stock fabric-covered, made-in-Germany,
official metric stuff, purchased from a legitmate local VWFlaps.

Since the local FLAPS here didn't carry none of that &quot;furrin stuff&quot;, I
now have a length of 1/4 inch (6.3mm) line in place.  It is a looser
fit on the carb fitting, but with a clamp it will stay just fine.

Now the question:
Is is possible that the &quot;good German&quot; fuel line is incompatible with
the ethanol, MTBE, etc. that is now being put into our fuel here in the
US?  I know that the auto manufacturers have had to make changes to
handle the current fuels.  There is, however, no reason for the
aftermarket line makers to change their product.

If that's the case, it would probably be better for US VW drivers to go
with US-spec line, even if it requires the use of clamps (which you
should be using anyway).

I know that this goes against the common wisdom, but lately it seems
that the common wisdom regarding fuel lines isn't so wise any more.
