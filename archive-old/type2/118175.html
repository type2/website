Subject: brazil kombis

perhaps the article i saw was premature? i dug this out of our 2001 archives:

While Volkswagen officials in Brazil refuse to say when or if
  production of the Combi would end, unions there - currently on strike
  at one VW plant to protest cost-cutting - say the company is
  uninterested in keeping old production lines going.

  For the last five years, production has been split, with Mexico
  manufacturing the Combi's engines and a Brazilian plant making the
  chassis. It is unclear where Brazil would get the motors to continue
  making the model.

maybe they figured that last bit out :)
