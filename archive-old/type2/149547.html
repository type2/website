Subject: Oil Sending Unit/ Oil Leak

Hi, I'm in the process of trying to find and fix a bad oil leak. The bus is 
a &quot;76&quot; 2.0 EFI. It loses about two quarts after about forty miles.The oil 
drips mainly from the middle rear of the engine somewhere behind the fan.  
It doesn't leak out when sitting, only when driving. Oil doesn't cover the 
engine but seems to concentrate around the oil sending unit (OSU) in the 
engine compartmant. So I'm going about the process of elimination....

Starting with the OSU. I got it off and found that the plastic part with the 
connector sticking out of it spins in place. Is that normal or do I need to 
replace it? I don't really think that this is my leak, however, because the 
OSU was tight in the case, and it doesn't seem that that much oil would 
escape through the loose plastic part. I'm thinking that I should look at 
the oil pump next??? Maybe the oil cooler???

Thanks for ideas!!

George
