Subject: Re: [T2] Home made Poptop canvas

Poor richard made pop top canvas for his bus. It's a split but he grafted a
late westy pop top onto it. used the zippered door or window of the tent as
a window in the pop top. pretty neat.


&gt; Anyone out there ever try to make your own poptop canvas for a 68-73
Westy?  I
&gt; have a bunch of old Eureka Timberline Tents in my garage (one perk of
running
&gt; Summer Camps for the past 7 years) and a sewing machine.  These are
quality
&gt; nylon tents, well they were, they have miscellaneous holes and broken
zippers
&gt; now. But my concern is the size of the fabric panels needed for the poptop
&gt; canvas. Does anyone one know approximately how big the LARGEST panel of
the
&gt; poptop would need to be?
&gt; I don't want to rip out my old canvas only to find that the tents are not
big
&gt; enough to sew a replacement.
