&gt; &gt; Knowing that the '77 era system is NLA, I wanted to go with the '72-74

&gt; &gt; this as a easy bolt-up alternative from Ron at BusDepot.  In speaking with
&gt; 
&gt; It will work. The 1700, 1800, and 2 liter engine blocks are identical. There

I can vouch for that, I recently made the switch on my 78.

&gt; heads is VERY slightly different between the '72-74 and the '75-78. The
&gt; difference is small enough that the 2-liter metal exhaust manifold gasket
&gt; will fill in the difference.  Another difference is that the '72-74 setup

I never noticed a difference it was that small?!

&gt; Simply put, nobody else can offer you what I can. From me you will get a
&gt; German left heat exchanger, a Danish right one, and a Stainless Steel bodied
&gt; muffler.  From anyone else you will pay MORE money, the left heater box will
&gt; NOT be German, and the muffler will NOT be stainless.

I can't comment on the heat exchangers since I scavanged them from a bus
being scrapped.  but the Stainless muffler is a tank...never saw one that
was that sturdy before.

NOW one small problem I had with mine and it wasn't the Bus Depots
fault. but the flange for the tailpipe was misaligned and while it can be
run without the tailpipe it is much better to have it.  Had I bolted the
tailpiece onto the muffler in the orientation that came it would have
pointed up at a 45degree angle towards the rear. but it wouldn't clear the
apron or the bumper that way.... I just cut it about an inch in from the
flange on the tailpipe, realigned it and rewelded it back up...works fine
but you might want to check on this rather than wait til your almost
finished and suddenly discover the tailpiece will not go on...like I did.

not sure if this is a common problem or I just happen to &quot;luck out&quot; and
get the only one that didn't fit.

in any case it is a good deal

YMMV
