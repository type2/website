&lt;&lt;  What sense would there be in getting the ceramic heater.  &gt;&gt;

None, a total waste of money. Since this subject comes up every year, and 
since original gas heaters have their drawbacks (high cost, parts, etc.), I 
am wondering about a propane heater from a small camping trailer. In my brief 
absence from the VW bus world, I bought a used Coleman pop up camper with a 
propane heater. Let me tell you this thing can crank! Drawbacks: camper 
owners would have to perhaps use up the space under the sink to mount the 
thing, passenger bus owners would have to be more creative. Also, a hole 
would have to be cut in the side of the bus for an exhaust vent. The Coleman 
will have to be sold in the spring to finance the purchase/restoration of my 
'77 Westy, and I'm tempted to pull the heater out of it for the Westy, except 
that it of course drops the value of the Coleman, which also has a roof air 
conditioning unit as well. BTW, my daughter and I took the Coleman camping 
only once, and you guessed it-right across from us in the campground was a 
Westy! The Coleman is nice, but it's just not the same!      Jeff S.
