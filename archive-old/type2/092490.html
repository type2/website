Subject: RE [T2] Anyone have a good 2L vanagon motor

--part1_4e.1087e8b9.2aa6e32f_boundary

Hey Everyone,
Back in VT without my westy :(  From a compression test it seems like I broke 
a ring and the tick through out the rpm range and the smoke after you rev it 
up.  So my question is I do not have any prior history to about the motor so 
not sure if I should try to drop the motor and replace the rings to get her 
home probaly breaking all kinds of studs opening up a big can of worms. Still 
have yet to drop an engine.  Really wanted a boston bob motor but the bus has 
to be out of its spot in a month so don't quite have enough bread.Thinking 
maybe somebody has a good used motor for now till I can save for the big one. 
 Anybody on the east have a good 2L  they want to part with for a reasonable 
price? Sorry to ramble just all stressed cause it's so far away and don't 
have any vw connections in that area.  Any suggestions on what to do are 
always appericated.
Thanks
Kevin 
80 Westy  (Smokey)      for now
