Subject: Re: [T2] windshield wiper motor

I thought my motor was dead, but I lubricated the shafts where they come 
through the body and the pivot points on the mechanism, and my wipers work 
fine again!

&gt; I thought my motor was bad so I had it replaced.  Come to find out it was 
&gt; the SWITCH that went bad.
