&gt; It sounds to me like you have picked up a stop plate and bracket the proper
&gt; bolts are I believe 45mm long shoulder bolts. The trans. or rear suspension
&gt; mount proper is a u-shaped channel that fits into your body and two rubber
&gt; cylinders are in between. Look under Rear Axle then Securing parts to find
&gt; an illustration of these parts. I hope this helps.

&gt; Could someone enlighten me as to the proper front mounting bracket
&gt; for my tranny?  It just doesn't look right.  No rubber buffers, no
&gt; beefy carrier plate like the one pictured in Bentley...just a thin
&gt; U-shaped bracket held on by two 17mm bolts about an inch and a half
&gt; long.  I got a carrier plate from the junk yard, along with the
&gt; rubber buffers, but I just couldn't get the pieces to fit.  Also the
&gt; bolts were about three inches long.  The picture of the carrier plate
&gt; in RMMW catalog shows a flat plate, the one I got from the junk yard
&gt; and the one pictured in Bentley is U-shaped.  Can anyone help?

the flat plate front carrier is for an auto tranny it is significantly
different than the Manual tranny.

the plate shown in Rocky Mountain catalog is indeed the auto tranny mount
NOT the one for a manual, it should indicate this but doesn't.

compare drawing in Bentley
manual chapt 6, illus  4.1
auto  chapt 7, hmmmmmm  no decent illustration, but in 1.1 notice the
housing on the far left. it has a slot into which the  flat plate
slides. the slot is lined with rubber to serve as snubber.

also it appears the 73-75 auto tranny may have used the same as a manual
tranny but having pulled mine enough times I can assure you that is the
part for a 76-79 auto tranny...!

also is another reason why the manual is easier to pull out as engine
tranny combined and an auto tranny is easier to pull out as seperate units
