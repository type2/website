Chris,

It's been a year or so since I ran into this problem on a girlfriend's
'74 Westy, but...

The fan hub tightens onto the crank with a tapered fit. If it won't stay
tight, most likely the fan hub has worn to the point where it no longer
fits tightly to the crank. We had a fan come loose on the road, so I
shimmed between the crank and the fan hub with a couple of layers of
paper, just to get us home. Got a new (well, good used) fan hub, and
that solved the problem.
