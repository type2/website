Subject: Re: [T2] Continuing Saga of Blocked fuel pump

&gt; Hey George, care to comment on the physics of a fuel pump trying to keep 
&gt; over 40 psi while working against a fuel tank or filter blockage?  Also, 
&gt; using a Bosch Ford 250 truck (89) pump designed for a 4 liter engine?

You know, I *thought* my pump was going bad once.. had all the symptoms 
you described.  I changed the pump out three times with no success.

Eventually I pulled the tank out and found a little piece of foil, like 
the kind that you find on the fuel injector cleaner bottles, positioned 
nicely inside the cup in the tank.  I fished it out with a hangar and 
put the tank back in.  That was annoying, to say the least.  I did 
change out all the vent a filler lines while I was in there, though.
