Subject: Re: [T2] What kind of Jacks/Stands to Buy

Having worked with the stuff, I've seen obviously &quot;perfect&quot; blocks that
broke in two merely from picking them up.  They can have cracks that are
too small to see yet which weaken the block completely.

OTOH, wooden blocks work fine, as long as you make a stable pile of them.
I use lengths of 2X4 stacked into a &quot;rick&quot; a foot square, flat side down.
