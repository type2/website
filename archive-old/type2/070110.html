&gt;Hi folks,
&gt;
&gt;I'd be interested in hearing details from anyone who has converted their
&gt;68-72 cooler to a fridge. I've seen conversion kits advertised for $300 or
&gt;so (I think it was in the West Marine catalog) and I believe RV outlets also
&gt;sell such a conversion kit.  I'm curious as to what kind of sacriligous
&gt;cutting must be done to the Westy cooler to fit the kit, and if anyone's
&gt;done it, was it worth it.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;

Regarding the earlier conversations that early 'loafs might have had fridges
as OEM, I wonder if maybe EuroAmerican RV (formerly Delta 6) might have
something along these lines?  They carry a lot of the Westfalia components
(bought a hand pump from them a year or so ago), so I thought they might have
something that would be a direct replacement and not require much (or any)
cutting.  Sorry, don't have their number here at work.
