Subject: Friday Rookie Question about Valve Cover Gaskets

I have been a life long greaser and gear head but for some reason I can't get my valve cover gaskets installed correctly on my 1977 Westy.

A few months ago, lets say 6 months, I noticed the bottom of my valve covers were a little damp and the bottom of the motor was a little damp and every couple of weeks there would be a single drop of oil under my bus, I should have tried to be happy with this.

I had a pair of gaskets in the parts kit that came with my bus and my brother-in-law, who actually has a giant VW tattoo, jumped at the chance to change them one night while hanging out at his house.

We started home and I started smelling oil and then we looked like we were being shot down over Japan in WWII with a solid stream of smoke pouring out of one side.

I parked it in my driveway and left a pissy message for my B.I.L. to drop by and try again while I was out of town for the weekend, he had success on his second try, he jokes that all of my problems are my fault for buying &quot;late model trash&quot; and then asks me if I will help him put a 2 litre in his '69 Karmann Ghia.

A few weeks ago I noticed the other side was leaking more and more all the time, I picked up some new gaskets and replaced it, it seemed to be just fine, I could see that the old one had been in crooked and was only holding in oil by a hair, I had no reason to expect the new gasket to be a problem.

After one 14 mile round trip to work I will now say it is leaking twice as bad as before I replaced the gasket.

Will somebody please tell me how to replace my valve cover gaskets one time so I can forget about them for a very long time?

Thank you,

JM
