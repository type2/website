Subject: Say what?

All,

I'm putting together an article for a VW newsletter and need your help.  The
premise of the article is &quot;Silly things non-VW folks say/do to or about VW's&quot;
Submissions should be more of a one liner, or a few short lines, than a
story.  Please let me know what has been said to you about your bug, bus,
ghia, T3, T4, etc.  I'll mention your name in the article.

ie, &quot;Would you like me to check your radiator?&quot;

Thanks,
Dan
