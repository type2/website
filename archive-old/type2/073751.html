Subject: re: Quick question on seal

&gt;I am installing new hatch, sliding door and engine compartment seals on
&gt;my 1970 bus and assume some sort of adhesive is in order. Am I correct?
&gt;If so what is recommended?

3M weatherstrip adhesive. rmmw sells it for ten bucks plus, but i picked up
a tube at my autobody supply shop for five. good for vent wing felt channel
too. 3M part # 08008    - steve
