Subject: Re: [T2] Why won't it bleed?

Hi Phil,

    You may want to check both rear wheels to see if either one is locking
up. Jack both rear off the ground, when you apply the brakes do they lock
up? If either one lock up, then the master cylinder is good. If nether one
locks up then like OldVolks says it a goner, replace, and bleed.
    If one locks up, then check the hole in the bleeder to see if its
stopped up with trash, rust, mud, etc. Unscrew it from the wheel cylinder,
and take a strand of stiff wire and clean it out. NOTE: do not apply the
brakes while the bleeder is out of the hole. You should be able to blow
threw the bleeder.
    If it is not stopped up, then the flex hose may be collapsed on the
inside, replace hose. NOTE: if you don't know the age of the hoses you need
to replace them all anyway while working on the brakes. At best they are
troublesome after five years or so.
    The master cylinder will only fail to work either the front or rear
brakes, not a peculiar wheel. So if the right rear works, the left rear
should get pressure from the master cylinder also. If not suspect one of the
above.
    BTW, check archives for instructions on bleeding and adjusting.
    Good luck.
