Subject: Re: [T2] need a good VW repair manual
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

Hiya Leisha,

The manual you can't quite remember the name of is &quot;How To Keep Your 
Volkswagen Alive, The Guide For The Compleat Idiot&quot;, by John Muir.  It IS 
still in print and should be available locally.  It is most certainly 
available online at http://www.vwbooks_dot_com  Muir's Idiot Book is aimed 
primarily at Bug owners but the info is applicable to Bussers as well.  In 
any event, most consider this book to be the bible of VW repair and 
maintanence.
But even Muir suggests that you have another &quot;standard&quot; shop manual as well.  
For most of us that would be Robert Bentley's &quot;Official VW Service Manual&quot;.  
There are quite a few versions of this manual aimed at the various VW 
products and age brackets.  You would be looking for the Green (the cover 
color) Manual for your Bus.  If possible try to locate an older copy at a 
book reseller's.  The older copies feture wiring diagrams in color; the newer 
ones are all black and white.  Besides, it'll be cheaper!  New copies are 
available at vwbooks_dot_com
But for a VW newbie, by far and away, the best manual is Clymer's VW Beetle 
1961-1979.  True, it is not written for Bussers.  But it covers the basics of 
VW construction, repair, and maintenance.  It supplies the reader with all 
the basic VW knowledge the other books assume you already have.  
Unfortunately it IS out of print.  However, it is almost on constant auction 
over at e-Bay, usually going for less than $10.00.
Were I you, I'd locate and buy all three.  Read the Idiot manual first, then 
Clymer's, and then use your Bentley in the shop.
