Subject: Re: [T2] snow stories

I waited until Friday to post my bus snow story. Of course, with temperatures in the high 70's here, it's hard to think about snow, but anyway...
  A few years ago I was having some problems with sticky brakes on my '67. It was one of those things on the list to do, but with nasty weather coming, I figured I'd wait until I could do it in relative comfort. (Not having a garage has distinct disadvantages, especially in winter) so, the snow had just started falling for real, and was up to about an inch and a half on the roads. I was driving home from work and happened to look at my speedometer, which was sitting flatly at 0. Saying a few choice words about the timing of that breaking as well, I continued to drive on rather slowly due to the worsening conditions of the local streets. I began to notice that the steering was a lot more squirrely than usual, and stuck my head out the window to look. To my surprise, the front wheels were not turning at all, due to the sticky brakes, and I was snowmobiling along! It certainly was an unusual sight...Oh well, at least I didn't have to fix the speedometer...
Happy Friday
