&gt;The reason you have &quot;success&quot; with silicone on any fuel related flange is
&gt;that it's a good enough seal to begin with, tolerances with the gasket are
&gt;sufficient and additional sealer is superfluous. I've seen plenty of intake
&gt;manifolds on various makes where owners used silicone to accommodate a poor
&gt;fit and they all eventually failed. You'll never see silicone sealant on an

I believe I already made this point.  Fact is silicone will fill minor gaps
left by gouges, PO, imperfections in gaskets, whatever.  Other sealents
will not.  I said in the beginning you must have clean surfaces, I'll keep
using silicone on Weber intake runners, and it will keep lasting 8-10
years.  I'll keep using Permatex on even brand new FI runners and it
will last indefinitely.  The FI graphoil or paper can deform easily into
small imperfections, metal bug gaskets can't.  I've had success because
I'm smarter than the gasket.

Like I said I use silicone on very few things.  But the things I do use it
on I use it on for a reason and from experience.  Novices can take this
advice or leave it.

YMMV.
