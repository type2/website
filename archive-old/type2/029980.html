&gt; Then I picked up a Magellan GPS.  Took it up to BNNTA last year, and on a
&gt; couple other short trips.  It worked great as a compass, worked great as a
&gt; speedometer, but the altitude readings were pretty meaningless.  We would
&gt; start up a hill with it reading 976ft, gain a couple hundred feet of
&gt; altitude and it would read 974ft as we crested the hill.  It was almost as
&gt; if it were not calculating the altitude dynamically, but looking it up by
&gt; sector or something.  Maybe it would be okay for large changes in altitude,
&gt; I dunno... I was disappointed.  I sold the GPS to buy a nicer one but
&gt; haven't bought the nicer one yet.  The Magellan 300 that I had can be found
&gt; for under $100 - Frys was selling them for $59 one time.

I'm not familiar with the 300, but it sounds like it looks at a single
channel at a time.  Since most people care more about their position than
they do about their altitude, they probably update the altitude less often
than the position.  Before SA was turned off, they actually slowed the
display update down so that the &quot;wandering&quot; wouldn't show up so much.

My Garmin GPSIII+ updates altitude every time it updates the position
(about once per second).  Works pretty well, but I wouldn't depend upon it
in the clouds in an airplane!
