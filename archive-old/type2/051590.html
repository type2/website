Subject: [T2] Re: need part # for double cab

Hi Stephen,


I also have a 76 Double Cab with the rear window frames in bad shape, I
would be interested in the size of glass, as this may be a simple solution.
The only other thought I have had is to go a boat window shop where they
could build a sliding window to suit, but it makes it far from factory not
to mention the extra cost.

Your solution is neater one, thanks.

&gt;The rubber you would need is the WCM Cal look type and I think the
&gt;part no is 111-321A and is described as:
&gt;Seal,Qtr Window,Cal Look Bug 52-64

&gt;I don't have the dimensions of the glass with me but do at home
&gt;so if you are interesed (or anybody else is) email me and I'll
&gt;get them off the hardboard template of the window I made.
&gt;This is what I have done in my '76DC and it worked fine,and still does.
