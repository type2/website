&gt; We use the Subaru EA-81 boxer engine in homebuilt aircraft.  It was in
&gt; the Brat and some
&gt; of the sedans.  It's built like a water-cooled bug engine - flat four,
&gt; 1800cc, probably 
&gt; about 65 hp.  I'm converting one right now to replace the two-stroke
in
&gt; my Avid Flyer
&gt; float plane.  Now that you mention it, it would make a bitch'n bus
&gt; engine, except I don't 
&gt; know where you'd put the radiator ( or the propeller :v) ).

I think that the power is a bit more than 65.  Perhaps somewhere in
the 80s.  I've seen conversions with this engine where the radiator
was located in the left side of the engine compartment, drawing air
from the left air inlet only.  The bottom was left open (no closure
needed, although it would seem to be a dust magnet)

As I recall (5 year old memory here) the radiator was a standard
Japanese car unit, and it was shrouded to the bus sheet metal with a
sheet metal panel and a rubber sealing flap around the outside edge. 
An electric fan drew air through the radiator.

The owner was happy with the conversion, though he had lots of stories
about the little problems surmounted in the process.  Kennedy supplied
the trans adapter and flywheel.
