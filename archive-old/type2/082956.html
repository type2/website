&gt; John,
&gt;
&gt; i asked this same question a while back.  i think it depends on each bus
&gt; on a case-by-case basis.  to determine if you really _need_ to do this,
&gt; i might suggest looking at tire wear. are the treads wearing evenly, etc.?
&gt; also, do your CV joints seem to be wearing out quickly, etc.?

A saggy rear is actually easier on CVs, as they have less angle.  It is
bad for tire wear if the sag is pretty bad.
