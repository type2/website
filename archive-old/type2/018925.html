Gentlepersons-
                       Close inspection reveals no ET on a set of Merc alloys 
I've acquired (may-
be he went home?). I do, however have these #'s
6Jx14H2
1084000902

AS1062

3  7 (with the 7 in a circle)

1.27760
     1

OK, guys, what've I got?
TIA.
Tony in NJ    If there's a site with a legend for these #'s...That'd be a 
help too!
