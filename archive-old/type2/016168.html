It was explained to me that the curtains in late busses are made of
polyester and the color is molded into the filament rather than dyed.  I
have dyed bus curtains before using the Rit dye like you find in the laundry
department of Wal-Mart.  It works, but how well depends on what you think.
I dyed a set of brown and a set of green curtains.  Both looked better than
before so I doubt you have anything to lose.  Be careful because the dye
works quite well on anything it touches.

My original Orange curtains are badly sunfaded. Has anyone got any ideas
on how to get them to look respectable again?
