Subject: RE: Catalogs

John Jensen is right about penetrating oil, wrong in a minor way about 
JCWhitney.  Fasteners are rusty because water got in there; it's not too
much to expect that the penetrating oil will get in there too.  And that's
just the physics of it.  The metaphysics of it is that the penetrating oil,
especially applied days before you get the wrenches out, is a message to
the part that your intentions are serious.

JJ says he throws out all but the VW version of the JCW catalog.  Too reasons
why that's a bad plan: (1) only the full catalog comes in a 10% off version.
THAT'S the one I save.  (2) some of the wacky stuff for other cars fits
VWs.  Westy owners especially will wish to be aware of the rec vehicle items
shown.  And just off the top of my head I can think of three things on my
Vgon (sunroof, gauges, stripes) that are not in the VW-only catalog.
