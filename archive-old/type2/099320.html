Subject: Re: [T2] tapping sound

High pitch = head stuff, low &quot;clacking&quot; noise = core stuff. &quot;Clicking&quot; 
noise, gear stuff.

&quot;Jack&quot; the van (Rear) so you can go underthe engine.
Take a big long screwdriver, put your ear at the big end and the other 
end at different location on the engine (near oil drain plug, cylinder, 
heads, valve cover).  Listen carefully; look for an increase in sound, 
the screwdriver act like a stethoscope. This way you will pinpoint the 
problem, or at least from witch side of the engine the problem is from.

Cheers, Ben
