 Someone had an idea a while back to get an

 spare juice to run the AC.
 
I originally had an AC compressor on my bus so it
had that second pulley
in front of the fan, I looked at using that to drive
a second alternator
that was mounted where the old AC compressor hung. 
the numbers never
really made it look like it was worth the work
involved.  I haven't given
up on it but it is not on the front burner either.  
would be interesting &lt;SNIP&gt;

I never said it would be easy - just that it seems to
be the only logical place to put it unless you use a
Vanagon case and convert all the support systems. The
small pulley is also a problem as it would have to be
nearly as big as the original pulley and if I remember
correctly, there isn't THAT much room! The way my 1000
watt microwave pulls my subey down from 2000rpm, I
think I'll just stick with the little cooling fan
mounted beside me. Seems like working the engine that
much harder isn't gonna make for much &quot;cooler!&quot;
But if it works... (!) -BaH
