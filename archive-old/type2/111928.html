Subject: Re: [T2] German hubcaps

&gt; BugHaus is selling late-style German hubcaps for
&gt; $15:

That's a nice price I must say! Over here at the
dealer they cost EUR 17,18 excluding 19% tax.

One thing is a bit weird though. The partnr on the
screen is:

   311 601 151 D

That's the number for the original hubcab. But the
title of the webpage is &quot;Hubcap 251601151A&quot;...and that
is the partnr for the Vanagon and 1980ties Beetles
hubcab. They fit to the older types and are also a
good quality but the rim is a bit thicker (it is justa
matter on how far you want to go on keeping your car
in original shape). So I wonder which part they are
selling here.

By the way: the price I mentioned is for the
Vanagon-hubcab. The original T2 hubcab doesn't even
appear on the 1983 fiche that I have! --&gt; NLA for a
long time already!
