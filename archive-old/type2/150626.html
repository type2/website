&amp;gt; Hey guys,
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;   What are the first symptoms of the steering box going bad?  I've  had
a lot of play which I was able to adjust to an acceptable amount  but am
hearing some popping sounds that don't sound like the ball  joints.  I do
have those noises (ball joint)  and will until  I replace them.  I think
I'm going with the Torsion Arms from  Bus-Boys.  But I don't really want
to have to buy a steering box  at the same time.  Thanks...KR

Steering box going bad feels like stiff or crunchy spots when you turn the
wheel.

If you're not sure, fix all the known-bad pieces of the steering first and
see if your problem goes away.  Look at the drag link very seriously if
you are getting popping noises.
