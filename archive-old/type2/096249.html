&gt; &gt;the hybrid design is
&gt; &gt;attractive.   consider
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;a 1200 or 1300 vw engine, through a hybrid drive, driving a Bus 
&gt; at 70mph
&gt; &gt;all day????  I think it is doable...
&gt; 
&gt; But where does the extra power come from to run the electric 
&gt; motor &quot;all day&quot;?  Please don't say it will be generated by the 
&gt; 1300 engine.  :)  I think hybrids are fantastic and will greatly 

most power is needed for acceleration, 1300 is more than enough to keep a
bus &quot;at speed&quot;  with the batteries picking up the load on hills (and
possibly getting some charging on the way down)

&gt; improve around-town mileage with tricks like regenerative braking, 
&gt; non-idling engines and CVTs.  I don't see how they will help 
&gt; highway mileage on level ground much though.

you set the engine for &quot;Most economical&quot; speed and then use electric for
everything over and above.   I was thinking 1300l pushing an alternator,
to battery pack to electric motor drive, CVT would be a bonus

the New York city transit Orion VI hybrids only have a 2.1liter diesel if
I recall
&gt; 
&gt; I want a hybrid bus with a 1.6l TDI engine, four hub-mounted 12hp 
&gt; electric motors with regen and a 1Kwh NiMH battery pack.  Won't 
&gt; somebody make it please???  :)

sounds good to me!
maybe VW will consider it an option on this &quot;retro&quot; bus they are talking
about?
