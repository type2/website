Subject: stats for JEROME JAMBOREE #8

Jerome &quot;Jammed&quot; Jamboree #8  sep 12 &amp; 13th by the ARIZONA VW BUS CLUB
was again a great success due to the efforts of the entire board of the
ABC led by Jon Stanton the pres!! the .50 cent a ticket camper that was
won was by far the finest splitty yet given away by the ABC!!featuring a
new woody interior and upholstery!! the camper will go to Sacramento for
a 1st time bus owner by someone who bought the tickets for him!!! now
that's an honest friend!! just short of 400 vws made this show--besides
the 150 splittys, and numerous later buses- this year some excellent
type 1s made the 6500 foot climb up to Mingus mountain!! and gold king
mine--42 differant vw clubs were in attendance!!! with Horizontally
Opposed VW Club out of Phoenix winning most represented vw club!!
loooong distance went to the Roker family from Hollywood Florida--2613
miles!!! just to come to Jerome--4 barn door buses!!!  event tydyed ABC
shirts--sold out!!!!$1000 went to the children's burn camp in
arid-zona!!!
the Jerome show is not and never will be a &quot;commercial&quot; type of VW
show--but every vendor there went home very happy!! the chilli cook-off
was won by Michelle Stanton
daughter of the pres--i tried her chilli--HOT! yes--but great to cure
anything in your body--Evan O'mara kept the kids happy with his painted
bus that gets better every year from the kids adding to it--.a thanks to
Don of gold king mine for letting us stay there 8 years running--and
thanks for showing us his 1942 HD!!!the Jerome Jamboree is a VW show by
VW people for VW people!! i have only been into VWs since 1965 when i
bought my 1st new VW--since then i've seen a lot of VW events--Jerome as
any knows who has ever gone to one is in a class all by itself---it
really is what the VW hobby is about--driving your VW regardless of what
it looks like to get there and no-one picking it apart!!and enjoying VW
friends at a relaxed, beautifull setting-and making more friends!!
1999--September--mark it on your calender!!!come visit with all of
us--if you really love VWs and splittys, you deserve it!!
