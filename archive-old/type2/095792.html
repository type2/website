Subject: Re: weep holes in battery trays

&gt;From: Bob in Houston &lt;perring_at_pdq_dot_net&gt;

[...]

&gt;the rubber grommet part of the nipple that secured them to the tray holes 
&gt;acted as a raised point that prevented all of the water from freely flowing 
&gt;out and off of the trays.
&gt;
&gt;Just having plain open holes will actually allow for better pan draining, 
&gt;in my opinion.

So why did VW put them there?  I think the idea was that the grommets would allow the water to wick out via capillary action; without them you have 
a hole through which more water and dirt can enter.  Not absolutely sure of that, but generally I try to replace the plugs when I can.  You can often 
find reasonably non-dried ones in junkyard cars.
