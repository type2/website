Subject: Re: [T2] Rear torsion bar adjustment (can I get my rear down?)

&gt;When I bought my 75 westy a year ago, it came with the rear end elevated

&gt;Can the torsion bar be adjusted (or mis-adjusted) to the point of causing 
&gt;this drastic difference?

Normally, the situation is that the rear is sagging, after all these 
years.  Someone must
have adjusted the torsion bars, and went a little too far.  The procedure 
is in the Bentley
Manual, there are three articles in the Type2 Library, and much discussion 
on this topic
in the List Archives.  Harbor Freight sells an inexpensive angle finder, 
and vwalley_dot_com
sells a torsion bar tool, that is a copy of the VW tool.
