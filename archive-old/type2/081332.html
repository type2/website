&gt; Well, I would disconnect the battery from the battery cables and connect a
&gt; multimeter to each of the cables and test for the existence of  an open
&gt; circuit. If there is none you simply have a battery that does not hold a
&gt; charge.
&gt;
&gt;  If you determine there is an open circuit, take out each fuse one at a
time
&gt; until the circuit closes. You then know where to look for the short.
&gt;
&gt; If you remove all fuses and the open circuit remains, you have narrowed
the
&gt; hunt to a few locations.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers and good busma,
&gt;
&gt; John

&gt; &gt; Whelp, as I said, switch is out, charger is out, new lighter installed,
&gt; &gt; radio is disconnected... all extraneous equipment removed... I jumped
her
&gt; &gt; this morning and she started right up, drove around running errands all
&gt; day,
&gt; &gt; stopped and started her, (she started right up again) parked her about 5
&gt; &gt; hours ago and her battery is already dead again...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I think it's time I brought her to the mechanics... sigh...
