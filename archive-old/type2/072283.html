Subject: RE: [T2] Trailer Advice
Cc: type2_at_type2_dot_com

I have been pulling car trailers for over 30 years, heck I use my trailers
so much, I have two of them and I have to agree with George, put radials on
your trailer!!  Have you ever ridden in a vehicle with bias tires, they
follow every crack our valley in the road, what a pain!  Well the same goes
for a trailer, it will be all over the road behind your tow vehicle and
that can lead to out of control trailers.

Always load your trailer 60% weight in front of the axles, 40% behind and
tie your load down!

Another thing, always have your trailer tires balanced, you can't believe
how much nicer balanced tires pull over ones that are bouncing down the
road.  It takes a lot of energy to pull a bouncing tire.


&gt;&gt; One thing to keep in mind if you do want to put Bus wheels on your trailer,
&gt;&gt; you need to use trailer tires. Bias ply tires are used on all trailers for a
&gt;&gt; very good reason. They track straight. If you put radials on your trailer,
&gt;&gt; they tend to wander and handle very poorly. Ask anyone that thought they
&gt;&gt; could save some money and tried this. They will tell you how poorly that
&gt;&gt; trailer followed the Vehicle.
&gt;
&gt;I've used radials on trailers in both single-axle and tandem
&gt;configurations.  Never had a problem.  As long as the CG is ahead of the
&gt;axle the trailer will be stable.  Allow the CG to get aft of the axle and
&gt;the trailer will be unstable regardless of the tires used.
