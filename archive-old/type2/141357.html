Subject: Re: [T2] Where in the $#_at_$#_at_ is the Fuel Filter on a '77?

&gt; sort of above the drivers side rear axle on the inside of the frame rail. 
&gt; really awkward location, and you will drown in gas when you change it if 
&gt; you are not real carefull.    (I put shut off valves on mine for changing 
&gt; filters or pulling engine)
&gt;

BTW: Quick tip for the rest of us who haven't got around to Bob's very 
sensible move of installing a valve, carry a Golf Tee in your tool box or 
glove box, they slide into the fuel line and stop it up quite well.

It WON'T stop you getting a petrol ( gas for those of you in Noram ) shower 
when you pull the tank side hose off the filter, but it will stop it up and 
let you proceed with the job RELATIVELY comfortably.

NB: Don't know about the tar mix in the States, but I got reminded at 
Christmas that petrol (gas) will do a wonderful job of dissolving the tar 
here in Oz, changing the filter on the street took me 10 minutes, scrubbing 
the tar out of my hair and skin took something over 1/2 hour :o(

FWIW, Golf Tees will stop up the fuel line pretty well ( about the only 
thing I remembered from the last time I'd changed fuel filters.
