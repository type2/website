&gt;***Unfortunately for us air-cooled owners, there is no way to realize these

Ok, David and collective, here's my thinking on why a water cooled oil
cooler might be a good idea.  First, while I agree that it would not help to
raise the oil to temp on start up, that isn't really the problem our engines
have anyhow.  Our problem is that when you head up the hill or drive with
your full complement of camping gear, or even just across the flatlands on a
hot day, that oil temp shoots up there.

And to cool it with a normal air cooler, you have a dilemma  between keeping
the small diameter oil lines short so the pressure doesn't drop, even though
there is nowhere good near the engine to hang the cooler, or running long
lines to the middle or front of the bus where there is a little more room
and air, but trading that for a pressure drop.  Also, air is just not nearly
as good a conductor of heat as water, so you need a relatively large surface
to cool with air.

I'm thinking that because the water is more efficient at soaking up heat,
you could have a smaller cooler near the engine where there is room for it,
and where the oil doesn't have to travel far, and then the  water
circulation could go through big 3/4 or 1 inch tubes pumped by an
inexpensive bilge pump, basically eliminating any flow restrictions.
You could control the temperature either by putting a mechanical thermostat
in the oil line, as is done with a normal oil cooler, and/or by  putting a
thermostatic switch on the water circulation pump.  Simple!

A nice side benefit would be that those in colder areas could have a better
heater if the radiator were vented into the cabin during the cold weather.

Anyway, that's my wild-eyed idea.  Interested in your thoughts.

Regards,

Grant
