Subject: engine conversion

Hello
        This is my first posting to this listserver my name is Phil Burton
and i have a few vws. I drive a 71 bus and a 71 super beetle. My dad has a
76 westy and he is putting a upright engine in it. If anyone knows of
someone who make a shroudh to cover the big hole left in the engine
compartment for this kind of conversion. Also does anyone know if the 71
buses had bench seats or just 2 seats that went all the way across.

Thnak You
Phil Burton
