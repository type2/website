&gt; I was just writing Greg Potts back and telling him that a VW representative

&gt; the front tire is useless or even more dangerous in a head-on?  If so, I'm
&gt; really disappointed in the guy who told me it would make the bus/passengers
&gt; safer!

I had a truck cut in front of me on I-81 at about 50MPH  my 78 had a tire
on the front, no evidence but I drove the bus from the accident scene, the
marks are still on the spare tire cover...

proof, don't know but I think it might offer some small extra margin

#1 safety feature, defensive driving
