Subject: Dead Bus

OK, I couldn't resist.

I bought my 71' Dead Westy from my Nephew, who inherited it from his buddy.
They used to tour the West Coast and I have two Dead decals.
When I bought the bus, I decided to go through everything just to see &quot;what
needed repair.&quot; I found
one peeling &quot;Air Garcia&quot; sticker, two, um...&quot;clips&quot; used on the back tail
light because the original spade connector had broken and last but not
least - a very  old, tin film canister. Who ever remembers tin film
canisters is dating themselves, but they made great air and water tight
containers. I thought I had struck the mother lode when I shook it -
something was in there! When I opened it and poured - out came rust!

By the way, I added the Harley and OB decals.
