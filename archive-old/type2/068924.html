Tire carriers are widely available from various sources, including J Bugs
(#AC601-4225 $12.95 800-445-2845).

BUT, you will have to DRILL holes into the front of you bus to attach this
mounting bracket.

You also might want to note that there might be some risks with mounting
your spare tire out front.  I was watching one of those network news
magazines a couple of weeks ago where some insurance institute was testing
SUV's for low speed (5 mph) collisions.  One of the Japanese SUV's had the
spare mounted directly to the rear hatch.  Since the tire stuck-out further
than the rear bumper, the bottom of the tire was directly hit during the
test. The force of the impact caused the entire hatch to buckle and
shattered the rear window.  Repair costs exceeded $2500!

Something to think about.

&gt; I have posted this before, but was unable to find anything out.  I am
looking
&gt; (patiently?)  for a front mounted tire carrier that fits into the
existing
&gt; holes on a 75 bus.  Anyone with one like this care to let me know the
vendor
&gt; from whom they purchased theirs?  I would very much like to get a hold of
one
&gt; of these.
&gt; 
&gt; thanks..
