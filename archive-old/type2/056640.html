Rodney:

I think a lot of folks are interpreting your starting problem as one
having to do with the starter, but you're saying it's cranking - just
not starting.

Considering the conditions under which it does and doesn't fire, you may
have an injector, perhaps the cold start valve, that's leaking.  When
you encounter one of these &quot;won't start&quot; episodes, give your tailpipe a
whiff immediately afterwards.  If it reeks of gasoline, you may have an
intake flooded by fuel that continued peeing by virtue of the residual
pressure in the ring main after you last shut it down.  If this were the
case, letting it sit long enough would enable much of that excess fuel
to either evaporate or seep into your crankcase.  Have a look at your
oil too.
