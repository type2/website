&gt; But ... when you go to that link - the first thing you read is that you were
&gt; trying to make money and using their .... intellectual property to do so ...
&gt; no?
&gt;

Who says it was theirs? Does it say anywhere on the artwork? It could
just as easily be one of these:

I'm not denying it's a bus (the descriptive text I put on CP describes
it as &quot;Bay Window VW Bus&quot; afterall.)

BTW: They didn't get 'em all:

http://www_dot_cafepress_dot_com/notcompbayred.61973524

I'll take it down in the morning I guess, just to cover my butt.

There's no dilution of trademark involved, and since I'm not
manufacturing busses, no design infringement. It's just a vague
artistic representation of a bay window bus used with a social
commentary.

I'm allowed to sell my social commentary if I so desire. If that
wasn't the case, newspapers would cease to exist.
