Subject: 73 auto tranny

ok guys, i got the bus and am dragging her home this
weekend.  i'll want to do the routine maintenance on
the tranny and am wondering just what i'll need to buy
and what weight tranny fluid i'll need.  i'm wanting
to go with a synthetic tranny fluid as i've had a lot
of luck with them in my manual trannies and i would
imagine it would cross over.  what parts can i still
get, what parts are NLA.  any extranious info that i
need but have not asked for would be nice also.
