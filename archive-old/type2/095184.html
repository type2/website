Subject: RE: [T2] The new pertronix ignitor II, and the 009 problems


&gt;&gt;No, What the Ignitor II does is have active variable dwell.

I believe the new Pertronix II NOW does what any CDI already does.  I 
believe that in a perfect world, the four cylinder engine has a maximum 
dwell of 45(please don't hammer me if I'm wrong)degrees per cylinder, but 
because of the opening and closing time of the points, this number decreases 
with speed.  It takes a certain amount of time to charge the coil's 
secondary circuit.  With a computer and an optical pickup, you can achieve 
an optimum dwell duration at any engine RPM, and ensure a maximum achievable 
spark.  My Crane CDI does this as well.
