Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Filler hose


I hunted high and low for this part. Dealers all said NLA. Busted Bus, Bus
Depot, Bus Boys, Rocky Mtn. etc everyone I contacted said Not Available.
Some one ,I can't remember who, said they were working on a repro but is
not out yet. Best bet is going to be make something yourself. I used marine
grade fuel fill hose. I soaked it in boiling water to soften it some.
Others have mentioned using other types of hose but you have to make
certain that the rubber is compatible with gasoline or else you will have
nasty crap in your fuel system.

I searched the archives and I was wondering if there have been any updates
on the extinct fuel filler hose (211-201-125D) that connects the tank to
the
filler neck on late bay models?

It seems there are a few options and I'm looking for leads:

- make/find a substitute piece

- hunt down one from VW for a lot of money if you can find it -- anyone
have
a dealer number that carried one they bought?

- wait for the repro that is in the works -- when?

- use the Vanagon part and cut it to spec -- What's the part number?
