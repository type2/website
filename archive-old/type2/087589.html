Subject: Save a Splittie Singlecab!!

I work in South Seattle, WA. and for the past two years I have watched a
split window, single cab slowely be vandalized in the adjacent parking
lot.  The singlecab is white and was once a commercial vehicle as it has
&quot;Autobahn Volkswagen of Renton, Washington&quot; painted on the side.  It has
some good rust but everything appears to be there.  Unfortunately, the
windows have been smashed recently and now one door seems to have been
bent off the hindges.  I thought I would put the word out on this list
and hopefully somebody will pursue it.  Its definetely sad to see it
waste away.  

The singlecab is parked in a large vacant parking lot in front of Totem
Equipment which manufacturers and sells excavators.  I assume someone
from Totem owns or knows something about the bus.  The parking lot is
located off East Marginal Way South between Alaska and Hudson Streets. 
The address of Totem is 5000 East Marginal Way South and the # is
206-762-9191.  

Let me know if you have any questions.  I could snap some digital
photos to post if needed.  
Chad
