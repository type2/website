&gt; Black = 1 AM Easter morning, with everything back in the '78, I turn the key

&gt; and my open door buzzer is buzzing.
&gt; 
&gt; Then I turn the key to START position, and instantly everything goes BLACK.  
&gt; Like, no warning or noise.  Like a fuse in the house went out, instantly.

sounds like the problem is in your ignition switch?!?
