Hi,

I am having connection issues on this starter.  I have a 6 volt system.  The
wires are both connected to the same post on the starter, I run the ground
to ground on battery, and the positive when touched to the positive battery
post, just &quot;snaps&quot; and burns a little mark into the battery post.  You ma
call this a short or something.

So, how should this be wired?
