&lt;&lt; You'll also need to close up all of the holes in the roof from the poptop 
hardware...and there will be a LOT of them. (from the canvas, the front
 hinges, the rear legs, and from the luggage rack. &gt;&gt;

and the cot......

The more I think about, the more it may make sense to remove the canvas and 
folding cot, but leave the fiberglass with a good seal around it.  You could 
then remount the top so that it pops up the same height front and back like 
the ASI Riviera campers (maybe even use the same hardware, I have seen two of 
these at area u-pull-its) and you would have a really unique &quot;safari&quot; wagon!  
You could even cut out a section of the fiberglass and glue in a piece of 
heavy, clear plexiglass.  

I have actually seen pictures of VW buses used this way in Africa at what 
must have been a national park.
