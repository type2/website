Hey all.
   In Wisconsin here- VWs are much rarer- so when people say &quot;little rust&quot;- 
it usually is like swiss cheese.
   I drove an hour to look at a &quot;lttle rust, good shape&quot; 78 bus.  There was 
no battery tray at all! The guy had a piece of steel running from the motor 
to a slot he had cut in the side of the bus so the battery would have a place 
to sit. There were holes through the sides- could see the interior panels 
standing outside. There was no rear bumper- as there was nowhere solid to 
mount it anymore. I could go on- but y'all get the point. He wanted 1K for 
this thing- motor wasn't much good neither, trans shifted poorly, interior 
was poor too- seats ripped/missing - panels trashed- dash cut at one point 
for big stereo- etc.
    He wouldn't budge a penny, telling me how much of a classic it was. 
Couldn't beleive that I offered him much less to buy it for parts! 
   Where do these people come from?
