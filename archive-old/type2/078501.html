Subject: Re: [T2] Progressively-Worse Missing/Hesitation



&gt; Hello -
&gt; On recent drives in my 79 bus I'd been noticing that about once every 
100
&gt; miles or so (mostly on the freeway), I'd feel the the engine miss 
ever so
&gt; slightly - just a slight burp or hiccup now and again

Check your dwell.  This could be caused by point gap closing up due to 
rubbing block wear.  After this happened to me after many trouble-free 
miles. I now check my point dwell every oil change.  It's a matter of 
simply switching the meter to a different setting as I am already 
checking idle speed and timing with the same hookup.
