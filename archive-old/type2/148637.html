Subject: Fan grill

Seems to me I used to have a round speaker grill made of woven wire just
like what you are talking about. You might want to check out a custom car
stereo shop and see if they have something that resembles what you are
looking for.

&gt; I've been thinking about making a metal fan guard and powder
&gt; coating it, as well. Very light welding rod might work. I'd have to
&gt; set up a buck, weave the wire, solder the intersections, make a
&gt; ring and tabs, and send it off to be powder coated. Might be a big
&gt; improvement on (ratty) plastic guard.

On another note, I need the corner sheetmetal on my '78 Westy from just
behind the drivers side rear wheel well around to the engine lid and above
the taillight. Can anyone recommend a source for the repair panel/panels?
