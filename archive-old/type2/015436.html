&gt;Tim I just saw your post about electric fuel pumps. A good way to add a
&gt;little safety to electric fuel pumps is to wire them through a relay. Using
&gt;a common 20 amp Volkswagen relay, with the relay getting its ground signal
&gt;from the negative side of the Ign. This way when the engine is not turning
&gt;over the fuel pump wont run. In an accident the fuel pump wont pump gas all
&gt;over the place. 

Another reason to keep it stock, then you don't have to think about
engineering a safe alturnative. If the vehicle is reasonably maintained
stock, dangerouse failures become a liability. Be stock, be safe.
