&gt; It's crazy that they are going after guys that are supporting the VW hobby,
&gt; yet they not doing this to eliminate competition in a market that they are
&gt; competing in, or willing to START competing in. They are simply doing it to
&gt; be vindictive and &quot;protect&quot; their copyright.
&gt;
&gt; I would have no problem with their actions if they were actually supporting
&gt; us, but they don't give a damn.

John:
I fear you're right that they don't give a damn. VWof America, that is. I get
really good parts service and a lot of help from the guys and gals at my local
dealer. They sometimes even come out and check out my vehicle when I'm driving
the double cab.
Other brands have taken a lot more proactive stance on licensing repro parts and
trademark items.
Two I'm familiar with are Corvette (GM) and Porsche.
They have both worked with many manufacturers to enable them to get their
products to market yet retain the marques ownership of the trademarks. I believe
they do this by making licenses relatively inexpensive.
In the case of Porsche they have actively solicited companies to re-tool and
build some parts that were in high demand and then marketed them through their
own system. Both these companies take the view that enthusiasts can be their
best salesmen and often customers for the new vehicles.
Sadly, this has not happened with VW of America.
