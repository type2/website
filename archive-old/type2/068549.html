As a follow-up to my previos post regarding using carbs on FI Vanagon
while retaining the Hall effect ignition:

As I said, the management of ignition has nothing to do with the FI
ECU.  Spark advance is via weights inside the distributor and via
a vacuum advance.  However, this distributor also has a vacuum 
_retard_ feature, which I wouldn't think you'd necessarily need.

So, block off the retard vacuum pipe and figure out how (or if) you
can hook up the advance vacuum.
