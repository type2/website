Ken said:
Then bail. Fold. Get out while you still can. Seriously, you do not do a
full resto on a car with limited collector appeal and expect to break even
or even close to even. You can get an excellent bus that somebody *else*
took a bath on for a third of what you're going to dump into that money pit.
- --------------------------------------
VanBondo agrees with Ken. That is why I have put minimal efforts into fixing
the aesthetics of the '57 Single cab. Granted, big bucks have been spent on
the '67 Westy &lt;that I grouse about all too often&gt; but that is because we
wanted to &quot;do&quot; one the right way and that it was/is the kind of vehicle that
we wanted to *use* for camping etc. If I put any effort, time, or money into
the '57 single to fix the rockers, doglegs, and battery tray and paint the
thing it would be because I wanted to learn to weld and paint. I also could
not probably get more than $2000.00 US for it as it sits, much less dump
mega bucks at it. I know of someone who recently found a clean '58 double
door for next to literally nothing. It will be a clean starter and might
command as much or more on today's market as the single as it sits! The time
to make the money (if that is your game) is before you even lay a hand on
it. Dont even register the thing! Spin it and take the profit. *BUT* Spend
the money to make it safe, dependable, (and maybe pretty) if you are going
to keep and use it. But don't get buried in it thinking you are going to
&quot;make money&quot; on it.
A really honest fine art gallery sales person would tell you &quot;When buying
art buy what you like. Don't count on a profit.&quot; 
A really honest software salesperson would tell you to buy the software that
comes closest to helping you to accomplish the task that *you* need done.
Not by the name brand and marketing hype alone.
I would apply the same logic to most VeeDubs. Buy what you like and comes
closest to fitting your life's needs. &lt;Common sense~!&gt; ~You *might* keep in
mind some general indicators of what will resell but with the &quot;trend of the
minute&quot; disease in the VW world, I wouldn't count on trendiness as Gospel
truth for the future.
Have fun!
