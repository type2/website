&gt;Don't throw money at your vehicle, give it only what it needs instead. 

I want to concur, but I cannot. Not completely. Sometimes a bus, like any 
vehicle, doesn't tell you what it &quot;needs&quot; until it needs it so badly that 
you're stuck. Or worse.

I have had my own adventures with driving across town in a vehicle whose 
clutch I could no longer control. It was fun and satisfying to restart 
the engine in first gear at every stoplight, and then to shift and downshift 
without clutching. But I wouldn't want to do it again. Same thing with 
driving twenty miles on hilly rural roads during an ice storm in Maine 
without pedal control of the brakes.

In the case of a certain set of critical components, it is better to 
throw a little money at regular intervals just because your bus might not 
tell you what it needs until it needs it, and that's too late.

But that wasn't what David was talking about, exactly. Whether to throw 
money at parts that might effect performance, rather than critical 
components, is a more subtle question.

The central maintenance problem with older vehicles like our buses is the
frog-in-the-saucepan scenario. You know: put a frog in a saucepan filled
with room temperature water and raise the water temperature one degree per
minute. The frog doesn't notice the change in temperature and before he
knows he needs to react, he's a boiled frog. (Actually, this is nonsense.
Ever put a frog in a saucepan? He jumps out no matter what. But this is
hypothetical.)

Unless you have POR-15'd and rustproofed and washed and waxed every inch 
of your bus, you can be sure that every minute of every day it's 
deteriorating a little bit. An imperceptable bit. Your electrical 
contacts are oxidizing green.

Your brake fluid is sucking water wherever and whenever it can. A tiny 
leak is letting some air into the system and you compensate by giving the 
brake pedal a bit of a pump. Don't even notice you are doing it. Just a 
wee imperceptable tap. 

Same thing with your steering and suspension. You take just a bit more 
effort to hold the bus in a straight line. You don't even notice it (but 
your arm muscles do, and eventually they will let you know what they 
need). The ride is getting more unsettled, but your response is to leave 
a few minutes later, to give yourself extra time to make sure your 
kidneys have done their thing and your bladder is empty. You don't notice 
you're doing that but it has the major consequence that you are less 
relaxed in traffic because you are cutting corners with your time.

To some of you, this is going to sound too New Age, but you're wrong and 
I am right. Every bit of slack you allow in your bus is being picked up 
by your body and mind. And that's stealing the slack you need to stay 
healthy and to being productive in your workplace and to deal fairly with 
people around you and lovingly with those you love.

And then what happens when your bus decides that it needs more than you 
can give it? &quot;Buses for Sale&quot; time, that's what. Time to give all your 
problems to somebody else, who ends up paying their good money for them.

Yes, it's a little wasteful to err on the side of preventative 
maintenance. But one mustn't do one's accounting the way corporations do 
it. We are not here to make a profit, and that alone. (I'm not sure why 
we are here, but I'm certain it's not to make a profit.) There are other 
things we need to get done in our three score and ten.

So, says I, make your bus as close to good-as-new as you can (and enjoy 
the effort) and don't confuse driving with maintenance.
