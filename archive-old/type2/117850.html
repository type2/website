Subject: RE: [T2] Champagne edition bus (any owners on the list?)

Brian,

At least on my 78 here are the major diffs....

The wierdest was the sunvisors...white on bottom and brown on
top.


Chrome bumpers with rubber bumper strips.
Brown Dash and lots of other brown parts...ash trays,door air guides,
	steering wheel and center cap, etc.
Brown turn signal and washer/wiper stalks
Brown door and window handles
Brown rear view mirror

&quot;Special&quot; color velour and vinyl seats
&quot;Special&quot; color carpet in both front and back
&quot;Special&quot; color wallboard vinyl(back had &quot;chrome&quot; tape strips)
&quot;Special&quot; exterior colors(datenut brown and fox red)
Fox red spare tire cover

&quot;racing&quot; stripes

Don't know if these were special or standard:
intermittent wipers.
chrome/aluminum(actually plastic) inserts on all window rubber
middle sliding glass windows(not vents)

Vincent would know for sure on some of the above.
	
I think that's it.  I would be interested in knowing about
the Champagne edition I...since I didn't know they actually had one
that year...

Cheers, dave
