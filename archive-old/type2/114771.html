Subject: surplus t-shirts for quilt

Hey all,

My mother has been hounding me for the past several months to get a bunch of
t-shirts together for a VW Event T-Shirt Quilt.  Does anyone have a bunch of
t-shirts left over from a show or campout they would be willing to part with
for a reasonable price.  This might be particularly handy to you as size does
not matter.  I know my own club generally has a bunch of odd sized shirts left
over which we sell at club meetings for around $5.

Any help would be appreciated and your event could be immortalized in this
quilt!!!

Thanks,

--
