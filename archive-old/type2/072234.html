That's a real shame, we need more bus people and shouldn't turn away
anybody.  You'll have to come up to Missouri and camp with some of those
people, very friendly always ready to lend a hand.  And heck, if any of the
KC Kombies are there, we'll even feed you!!

Sorry about your bad experiences, those people should own BMW's, not VW's.


&gt;   I realize this may be a Friday subject, but this just happened this
&gt;morning.  There was a VW gathering rather close to where I live and I
&gt;decided to drive out there to meet a few other VW enthusists.  We have not
&gt;had our VW during a camping season and this was my first outing with it.
&gt;I pulled in, got out, walked up and said Hello to several people (members
&gt;of the club) and proceeded to look at the cars on display, (mostly
&gt;beetles, one type2) and was not spoken to the entire time I was there.
&gt;So, I finished looking walked back to my 78 Westy and drove off.  I sure
&gt;hope other clubs are friendlier than this one seems to be.
&gt;Thanks for allowing me to vent my frustrations
&gt;(was looking forward to an afternoon of relaxing and visiting)
