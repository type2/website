&gt; Does anyone know how to secure the distributor down? I got the motor

&gt; distributor is just &quot;sitting&quot; there.  Seems dangerous so I haven't

I'm a little confused by your question, but I'll gander a guess
anyway. The distributor is held onto the block by a flat piece of
metal. If you look at the engine from the fan side this metal should
go around the distributor with a nut that allows you to loosen it &amp;
adjust the timing. The mount is held in place right to the left of
it by a stud in the engine case. If you see this this is all you need.
Pictures would help if you have any.
