&gt; &gt;From what most of you had to say I think I will put the new 2000cc

&gt; I measure for tolerances. The cam from the 1800 looks new. (The 3 good

Cams are cheap and avaliable, buy a new one,  $65 from RMMW, $175 if you
want to upgrade to hyd lifters (I would, heck I did, hyd lifters are the
greatest thing since sliced bread IMO)
