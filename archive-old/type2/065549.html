Subject: Re: Overheating rebuilt 2.0

&gt; 
&gt; (message posted on vanagon list also)
&gt; Howdy,
&gt; Some of you may remember me,  my name is Clay Perry and I dropped off the
&gt; vanagon list last April when I changed companies and lost the gratis net
&gt; connection.  I have a major problem with my 78 and I need the expert advice
&gt; of this group.
&gt; 
&gt; The problem-
&gt; New rebuilt 2.0 overheats quickly topping 210 in five flat miles, timing has
&gt; been checked and the advance verified, the FI is in specs and not running
&gt; lean,  the oil cooler swapped and the flaps checked to verify opening and
&gt; closing. What else could it be? for more details and the whole story read on.
&gt; 
&gt; A bit of history-
&gt; I purchased a 78 westy with a fried clutch, and decided that what I wanted
&gt; was a good reliable system to drag around the mountains so I opted to replace
&gt; the engine and transmission with rebuilds. I bought the transmission from
&gt;  Trans Form and after checking around the engine came from Mark Stephens.
&gt; After installing the engine everything worked great but the van would not go
&gt; farther than five miles, either freeway or city  without the temperature
&gt; climbing past 210. I checked the timing several times and disconnected the
&gt; thermostat so that it was always blowing air over the cooler. I finally took
&gt; it to a local shop and had them test the injection mixture and see if it was
&gt; running lean. It proved to be a bit rich. I had them check the timing and
&gt; verify that I installed the engine correctly. We decided to change the oil
&gt; again ( I had changed it before) and found a ton of metal in the oil. I
&gt; called Mark Stephens sales guy, Bill  and he said “ sounds like a problem
&gt; send it back pronto” we pulled the motor rushed it off where it sat for three
&gt; weeks (did I mention the kept my core deposit for 120 days) they tested the
&gt; motor by putting it on a test stand running to check the oil pressure at
&gt; different temperatures and checked the compression.  They sent me a video
&gt; tape showing the motor running and what the gauges said with plenty of
&gt; condescending attitude mixed in. The metal in the oil was explained as bits
&gt; from a billet cam gear wearing in. I said “fine if you say it is OK send it
&gt; back” so I waited another week and half before calling again to hear “ we
&gt; didn’t ship it because we have been busy, and by the way you owe us $220 for
&gt; the evaluation” I said “you guys told me to sent it and you never mentioned a
&gt; charge, besides what did you do?” of course they held out and shipped it COD
&gt; so I couldn’t even sic VISA on them. The engine has arrived, the oil cooler
&gt; is swapped the timing checked and the fuel injection adjusted, still this
&gt; motor runs for five minutes and overheats.
&gt; 
&gt; What do I do now? I would appreciate any advise, and if you want the
&gt; uncensored opinion of Mark Stephens motors E-mail me direct.
&gt; 
&gt; Clay      I'm Shocked at the attitude of Mark Stephens!
   If a company says and advertises about Quality Work then i think customer 
service should be right up there.
    I've delt with a few of the major mail order shops and had few problems.
 Lets let &quot;word of computers&quot; tell the stories to everyone.   Peace Phil
