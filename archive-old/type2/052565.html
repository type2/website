Subject: Re: [T2] Steering Box Squeak

Greetings -

Just to let y'all know, it was the tie-rod making the squeak. The symptom
included a squeak when the suspension moved, and a squeak when I moved the
steering wheel, even slightly. The tie-rods are the only components down
there that move in both instances.

In hindsight, I suppose if the squeak came from the zerk areas, it wouldn't
have squeaked when I turned the steering wheel, and if it had been the
steering box, it wouldn't have squeaked by moving the suspension (rocking
from side to side). The symptoms were telling me all along. I just wasn't
listening.
