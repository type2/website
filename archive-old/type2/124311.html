Subject: Re: [T2] really really need a/c belt part #

From Dave:

After looking at my new compressor, it has one groove that is &quot;thin&quot;
and probably fits the original a/c belt.
 
 I looked for my original belt and can *not* find it.
 
Would someone please please look around on theirs for a part number?
