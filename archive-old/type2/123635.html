Subject: parking wipers

Hi,

Is there any way to adjust the park position on the windshield 
wipers? Mine are really too low and I cannot adjust the wiper arm to 
the shaft because the shafts have a flat spot where the wiper arm 
screw rests against the shaft. The bus in question is a 1968 bus and 
as far as I can tell the shafts are more like 67 and earlier than 69 
and up. I am not even sure if the flat spot on the shaft is from wear 
or is a design feature.

Thanks
Chris
