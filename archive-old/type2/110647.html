Subject: Re: [T2] Sunroof parts needed 

I need the little levers/sliders that ride on the
cable and make the tail of the roof rise at the very
very end of the cycle of closing it flush with the
roof line.  They are different left and right, fragile,
and I'm so much at a loss that I am considering sealing
the roof.

Of course, if anyone knows the part number or the name
of these, they could help me write a more coherent note...
