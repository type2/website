&gt;From: Ray Nemo, the Bus Captain
&gt; &gt; Any experience or thoughts with the CB filter?
&gt;  http://www.cbperformance_dot_com/catalog.asp?ProductID=202
&gt;  Does it work?

A couple of notes:

1) NEVER put a filter on the intake side of a pump. You are just asking for 
cavitation and loss of oil pressure, especially when the oil is cold or the 
filter gets dirty. (The filter does not appear to have an oil pressure 
failover.)

2) That is the same filter used on my Yamaha motorcycle. The Emglo version 
costs me $2.50. Fram gets $4, but they include all of the gaskets for the 
bike as well.

The filter screen on the intake is just an emergency filter in case your 
oil bottle cap or a stone or something ends up in the sump. Do yourself a 
favor and install a full flow filter on the pressure side of the pump. Even 
the &quot;pump/filter&quot; combinations are better than this. The ones wired to the 
pressure relief valve aren't great, but they dont require machining and 
will help somewhat.

That said, some people like to use these without the filter but just use a 
pickup tube extension from a full sized sump as just a mini-sump to hold 
oil during cornering or on bumpy roads and the like.
