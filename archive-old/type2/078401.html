Subject: RE: [T2] Mt. Shast Snow Trip  &lt;Tire chain advice&gt;

&gt;&gt; Which brings up a question. I never ever have had to
&gt;&gt; have snow chains, but I want to join in on this trip
&gt;&gt; because there wont be any lowered buses there. If I
&gt;&gt; were to pick up some chains at a garage sale what are
&gt;&gt; the chances that they will fit my 205/70/15's ? 

Real good.  This is a common tire circumference.  Look on the box, but definitely test them before you hit the snow.  

&gt;&gt; chains very in saize too much to hope they will fit.
&gt;&gt; And what are the chances of throwing a chain into the
&gt;&gt; unshiney orig paint on my kombi? 

Never seen it happen.  And folks around here run them all the time.  The key is to ensure that you have all the slack taken up, with a bungie cord type device (preferably the special made deal that comes with the chain sets.)  YOU CAN THROW A CHAIN IF YOU LEAVE TOO MUCH SLACK, DRIVE TOO FAST, OR DRIVE ON DRY ROAD.  Don't do any of these.  Take them off as soon as you can.  

&gt;I say driveway becuase this is the first plsce you should try them.  Don't
&gt;leave it to when you are trying to mount them in a blizzard with wet slush
&gt;tricking down your arms and onto your pants!

Ditto in a big way. 

&gt;If you really want to do it right, get an extra spare tire and carry the
&gt;chains already mounted on the spares.  It's a lot easier to swap wheels
&gt;than it is to put chains on.

Don't agree.  It's easy to put them on, assuming you are not stuck already.  Drape them over the rear tires, then pull forward a bit.  That reach to the back lever-thingie is rough, but certainly not harder than changing a tire.  

&gt;Many folks prefer cable chains to &quot;real&quot; chains.  They run a lot smoother
&gt;but don't bite quite as well.

Never tried them.  If you use chains properly and only when necessary, I'm not sure what advantage these would have.  

Good luck,
