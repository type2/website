&gt; &gt;just an addendum to that, I was watching the news the other night and they
&gt; &gt;were covering the Lake Tahoe fire and as they paned the camera along some
&gt; &gt;houses there sat a Bay still smouldering from the flames, based on where
&gt; &gt;it was located in the driveway etc. I suspect it was on the road and just
&gt; &gt;wasn't able to escape...
&gt;
&gt; dayum, I don't even know 'em, nor did I hear about a burning bus
&gt; (although I haven't talked to Mike yet. . .it wasn't sahara beige was
&gt; it?)

only color was burned black.  looked like maybe a late bay but there
really was very little left...just a charred shell.

 .  I live 1/2 mile from ground zero, fortunately the wind blew the
&gt; fire the other way, my buses were in the driveway while I was off in San
&gt; Diego for the weekend, flew back early to a lot of smoke but I was
&gt; lucky, unlike some friends. . .

yes very lucky, many lost more than just a bus.
