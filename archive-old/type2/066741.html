Subject: re:Where would you go in your VW? &lt;a friday question&gt;]

  Rusty queries: 
    Where would you like to be able to drive your favorite VW if given the time,
    health, and a modest budget. Who would you take along and why? What vehicle
    would you take?
    
Early September. Daddybus. The Anchorage-Fairbanks-Tok-Glenallen-Anchorage
loop, with a sidetrip down to Seward and Homer. Maybe a side-trip up to
the hot springs (then again, maybe not). Visit the old stomping grounds
and show my daughter Willow from whence she came (spiritually, if not
physically). Maybe with a nice white 'vert bug for day trips.

Saw a short PBS piece on Kenai Fjords last night. I guess I'm getting
nostalgic again.

'71 Campmobile (DaddyBus)
