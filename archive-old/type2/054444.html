Subject: Re: Extremely HIGH oil pressure

i too would like to have 80 psi oil pressure !!!
when you figure out how you got it, please
let us know so we can all have it .
( i run my pressure in the late bus  w/ 911
engine at 10 bar, or 147 psi, dropping  to
100 psi at full warm at idle...
cooler takes it, the seals are holding, and
there is an awesome amount of squish in
the mains.
however, my VDO gauges peg the needle
when they are not hooked to source input,
and have power and ground working.
