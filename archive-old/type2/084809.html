Go to the Gene Berg online catalog:
http://www.geneberg_dot_com/casepg22.htm

page down to &quot;Technical Information       The Stock VW Case&quot;

...and read what he says about what is involved in PROPERLY rebuilding an 
engine.

If a plain-Jane 1600 suits your purposes, I'd advise you to just get a new 
engine.
I put a new Brazilian engine in my bug ten years ago.  It's still a great 
little motor.
Back then, they only cost $825--I bet they're a bit more now.

If you want something more, like larger displacement and/or full flow oil 
filtration,
then buy a new case (modified accordingly), and rebuild the engine.

I don't think an &quot;inexpensive&quot; rebuild, done by someone else, is going to 
be very
satisfying for you, down the road.
