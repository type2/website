Subject: 79 Door Handle parts

Hi Volks,

My Uber-Kamper project is coming along pretty well, with a lot of brute
force and sandpaper being brought to bear on the miscellaneous corrosion on
the surface of my donated 79 bus. At this rate it will be done before the
snow flies, sooner if I get lazy and whip out my wallet to pay a
professional.

Most of the door-handles and locks are missing from the '79 transporter, but
it is not a big problem as I can take most of them from my rusting-to-death
'73 westy once the motor and transmission are transplanted. However, the
door-handle on the sliding door is a whole different animal. I figure I can
have the lockplate hole welded over easily enough, but I still need the seal
and bushing that go between the handle and the skin of the door. Type 2's
just aren't available in the local boneyards here-abouts, if anyone on the
list has a spare I'd be happy to haggle with you.

Let's see... What else do I need? Well, if anyone in S. Ontario has a
straight and reasonably corrosion-free 74 - 79 rear bumper, I'd be happy to
hear from you too.

Thanks,

Greg Potts
