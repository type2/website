&gt;Well, yeah, maybe $200 in parts is reasonable.... But, then again I didn't

&gt;it myself.

Hmmm... that's exactly the reason that I don't feel comfortable having
someone else do it.  I don't like putting my life in other people's hands
any more than necessary.  I don't want to be a jerk about it and I
appreciate your reasoning, but the brake repair places love to scare people
with stories of total brake failure and I've heard that quote about &quot;no
second chance&quot; more than once.  Truth is there are lots and lots of things
that can go wrong with a vehicle which can kill you if you're going 60mph -
wheels, tires, bearings, axles, suspension, steering, etc.. but there seems
to be this stigma with brakes.  Visions of careening down a mountain road,
busting through the guuardrail and over a cliff.  :)  If my brakes ever
fail,  I'll just drop it into a low gear and try to hit something cheap.  :)
