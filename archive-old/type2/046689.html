Subject: [T2] Gauges

I have an empty gauge bay in my bus and need to decide...

Head temp or oil temp?  I have a 72, and from what I've read, looks like
you need to put a hose adapter on the oil temp sender because there's
not enough room to actually mount the sending unit where it needs to
be...  So that makes it a tad more costly

Which gauge will do me the most good?  Will the VDO gauges fit right
into my dash?

I've also got quite a shopping list of tune up parts, misc
rubber/poptop, etc and tools...  Any recommendation on the best source?

Thanks!

Teri
