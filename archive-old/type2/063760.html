Subject: SUCCESS!

 Pulled my first motor by myself this weekend on my 74 westie.  Man those   
motors are heavier than a type one!   I did it in front of my townhouse   
in the parking lot.   The neighbor normally see me every weekend working   
my VW'S.   I always try to be as friendly as possible to all the   
neighbors just to avoid the flack I will probably get one day.  But   
anyway I had to replace the main seal behind the flywheel.   I was   
starting to call my bus Puddles with all of the oil it was marking its   
territory with.  I would not advise anyone to do it alone especially   
putting that type 4 motor in.  What a hard time.  But anyway it now runs   
and so far it is not leaking oil.  It is always a wonder to me when I do   
something like this that It works when I finish.   I kept that fire   
extinguisher handy and hopefully won't have to use it.

  One quick question,  is there a art to putting the exhaust on properly.   
 I have a hell of a leak some where and it is loud.  I put on new copper   
seals on but has anyone tried high temp silicon to mount the heater boxes   
 to the heads?  Please E mail me direct if you can.   ESOWDER_at_RFMD.COM   
     Thanks
