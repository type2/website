Subject: doghouse cooling Q's and needs

I'm putting a 1600 SP engine on my 69 bus. The new (used) engine has an 
external oil cooler on it, which I'd like to switch to a doghouse set-up 
like in a '71.

I've sourced the shroud and the two pieces of duct tin for behind (in front 
of) the oil cooler, and I can make the infamous &quot;hoover bit&quot; but I need the 
firewall tin with the duct exit hole which goes over the tranny.

Anyone got one of these they'll part with for $$ or parts trade?

ALSO: About the cooler: do I need to buy an all new offset cooler, or is 
there an offset pedestal I can buy for a stock in-shroud cooler. And who's 
SURE about which seals go where?

I've heard stuff on the list about buying &quot;refurbished&quot; or &quot;new&quot; coolers 
which were junk.

Help me get the 69er on the road. My Memorial day weekend will be greasy -- 
and I'm not talkin' barbecue.
