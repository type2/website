Subject: Re: [T2] vredestein tires

&gt;&gt;Last week I ordered a pair of Vredestein COMTRAC '185R14C R' reinforced
sidewall van tires...they are Dutch tires.  load range
D, 1900 lbs.&lt;&lt;

&gt;just curious, but i thought the 'C' in the 185R14C tire description
&gt;designated these as C load range? someone please educate me if i'm
&gt;misinformed!

Hey Joel, you find your vacuum leak yet?

As Karl pointed out, the C suffix in 185R14C stands for
commercial/reinforced sidwall for a stiffer ride.  Load Range in the US is
also called &quot;number of plies&quot; as in load range C = 6 ply and load range D =
8 ply.  load index is the total rated weight, and these have a load index of
102 which is close to 1900 lbs.

For a better explanation, see:

Another lead, someone on the www.fullmoonbusclub_dot_com forum just bought some
Wynstar Phaser tires (these are from a Chinese factory co-owned by
Michelin).  I would assume that these are the RLT 51 shown at
http://www.cmatire_dot_com/wynstar1.html.  rated the same as my Comtracs and
were had for $250 for a set of 4 mounted and balanced. . . hard to beat
that. not sure where they were bought either, he is in Asheville. . .
