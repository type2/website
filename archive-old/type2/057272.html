Subject: Re: Bad alternator?  Possibly related to hard starting...

It's probably the alternator. You should try putting in a new set of
brushes. Could be the regulator too tho. That doesn't mean, of course,
that the battery itself isn't dying -- even a brand new battery can be
killed quite quickly by being run down all the time -- it sulfates. But
the battery could be a total goner and the alternator should still be
capable of throwing out 15-16 volts when revved up, so if it doesn't,
then it's the main culprit.
