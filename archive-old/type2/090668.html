Subject: Re: [T2] ugly bus competition

&gt; Jennifer............. Take some advise from an old guy that has seen a
&gt; lot. Don't paint your van a metallic color and don't use clear coat on
&gt; your new paint job. Both are bad ideas.
&gt; The metallics fade crack, the clear coats turn yellow and craze,
&gt; sometimes coming off in sheets.

And old vws just dont look right in metallics or clear coated.
