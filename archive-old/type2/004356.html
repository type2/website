Subject: replacement vacuum can
Date: Fri, 15 Sep 2000 19:48:00 -0700
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I need to replace  a busted vacuum can on a dizzy I'm rebuilding......I have
a working one but it is clearly from a different/later dizzy, although it
will fit, it is bigger.
Is the volume of the can specific at all to the dizzy?.......surely the
vacuum is governed by the engine?
Can anyone in the UK suggest a place that will carry an exact replacement?
Thanks again
Garp
