&gt;  Well the below freezing weather is comming up and i need to get some 
&gt; information
&gt;  on what the best way to keep the inside 
&gt;  of my bus warm is.  Thanx for all the help with this and other questions.

Well I've only used it a few times but the NEW Eberspacher D1L'C' petrol
heater in my new bus gives out 2.2KW which demists the screen and warms the
bus up quite nicely.

Cost was £600 ($1000 US) including fitting and tax.

I think some one posted an address for Eberspspacher in USA the other day

Good luck 
Bob
