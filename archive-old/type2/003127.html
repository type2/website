Yikes..well I guess this is why we have this list...there is always someone
else who has done something you are thinking of doing.
I have not started my soundproofing proofing project yet, but am gathering
information.  I don't think I want to go as far a Mathew Bulley
did but I would like to get the noise down in the cabin of my bus.
If anyone has any advice or experiences with this, please p-mail me and I'll
make a general post of things people have done to tackle this issue.
Ciao
