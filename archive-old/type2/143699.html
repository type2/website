Subject: compression test results

hi all,

  I just finished a compression test on my 74 bus. 
Here are the results

Cyl 1 ==== 121 psi
Cyl 2 ==== 135 psi
cyl 3 ==== 121 psi
cyl 4 ==== 130 psi

On cyl 2 the spark plug was very dry and brownish
grey.  The other spark plugs looked the same black and
gassy.  Does this give me any insight to why i can't
get my bus to run well?  

I am still not able to time it right.
