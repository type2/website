Subject: Re:  Small Bone Yard find

&gt;&gt;and a 2nd jump seat to modify and place on 
the right side.  Anybody 
ever done this and could share any pointers 
learned from experience? Any one 
else think $30 too much for these items?

I'm interested in doing this also.  Please let me
know of any feedback you get.
