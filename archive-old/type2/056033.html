Check valve defective. BTDT. Not sure of the exact details why, but it
allows air into the manifold thus leaning the mixture and thus
increasing RPMs.  I know you just replaced it, but.... You might check
to see that all the hoses are still connected and in good order. FWIW I
paid $10 used, I didn't even know they came new.
