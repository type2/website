Subject: Re: When to part out? '71

&gt;What I am after is confirmation that this thing is ready for the 
&gt;crusher.  I am not super happy to be the guy that gets to do it.  I 
&gt;don't like the feeling of being judge and executioner.  However, the 
&gt;previous owner has handed down the sentence.

Jim,

Part it out, crush it, no regrets.  Those donor parts help other buses and I
can't imagine anyone interested in buying a vanilla baywindow bus that's so
thrashed.  Even if you stored it and kept it in its current shape for 10
years I can't imagine much interest (you can quote me in ten years).  I had
no problems crushing my '70 Westy after I saved most of the useful parts.

Heartlessly yours,

Ron

71 Westy
(Currently looking for a deluxe barndoor to part out and crush)
