Guten Nachtmitag List,
    Well, it happened to me today.  My beloved hunk of engineereing left me
on the side of a desolate country road.  About a month ago I too had gas in
my oil.  So, according to the lists wisdom I checked the cold start valve,
fuel pressure regulator, and the fuel pump.  Everything tested out ok.  But,
I was still unsure of the bus's road worthiness and kept her reigned into a
10 mile radius from home.  She was running pretty well, so I thought I would
give her a 40 mile trip on the two lane, just to test the performance on a
trip where engine temps could rise(read hilly two lane highway).  For the
first 20 miles my baby just purred on past the speed limit to 60-65 up and
down the hills.  Engine oil temp, mounted in the sump plate and confirmed
close enough with boiling water, ran around 230-235 once i was on the road.
Then, all of the sudden I felt a hesitation, but the bus kept going.  &quot;Huh&quot;
I thought to myself as instrumentation was checked for any deviations from
the norm.  Everything seemed normal, so on we went. Then the engine died and
the oil light comes on.  I rolled  to a stop on the shoulder, and went
around to the engine, opened up the hatch and was welcomed with a *hot
dipstick and smoke coming out of the oil fill tube.  Thanks to the kind
people of N.W Oklahoma who stopped to help push the bus onto a side road.
    I waited 1 hour for a flatbed to pick up my bus.  When he got there, I
tried to start it up to drive onto the bed.  NO go, only backfires.  Crap.
So now my baby is home, I don't have any idea what is wrong with it, and I
don't really have the time this summer to go through a rebuild.  I had a
valve seat replaced on the #3 exhaust last week by a local perfomance shop,
maybe that is a contributing factor??
    Oh yeah its a 78 Transporter, with manual tranny, 2.0L FI.
Thanks in advance....

Isaiah Smith
