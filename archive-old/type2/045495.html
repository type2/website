Subject: Re: [T2] brake problems

Alex Wisniewski sends:

&gt; I bleed the brakes untill the bubbles stopped and kept
&gt; bleeding with fluid passing through.
&gt; What I have replaced is, brake hoses, and rear wheel cylinders.
&gt; 
&gt; I dont know what else to do, can anyone help me out with
&gt; this problem? I dont know what else to do ;(
&gt; I've read more then I can handle on brakes, now I need help.

Check the lines, front calipers, and the master cylinder.
