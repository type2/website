Subject: Re: Speaker placement suggestions

How to place stereo speakers in a late model Westfalia?

Very typical placement is two in the front doors and two in the bottomn 
of the overhead locker in the way back. I think the ones in the back are 
only well placed when you are lying down back there (and then the 
placement is quite good.

The PO of my old bus installed very neat looking felt-covered boxes on 
the door panels to give the extra clearance necessary for a larger pair 
of 2-way speakers than would have fit in the doors without a little extra 
clearance. Looked good, sounded great.

A friend of mine once put a big bazooka type shotgun kicker/subwoofer in
the locker where the spare tire once went, right behind the driver's seat.
Mounted it in a hole cut in the wooder cover that secures with a hand twist
screw. He also mounted two of those little satellite tweaters (the little
round ones about 1&quot; in diameter) on the metal pedestals to each side of
the windshield so they are line of sight to front seat passengers. That
with midrange speakers in the front doors was a really kicking system. The
high mounted tweeters really added a lot of stereo imaging relative to
having e'm down around your knees in the door.  High sounds are very much
line of sight while low sounds are more or less nondirectional. So if you
can't see the tweeters you can't really hear what they're putting out. 
Got to watch out for interference from the bunk bed sling, if you ever 
use it.

I thought about ways to enhance rear placement. I thought about using 
those speakers that mount in a cabinet but come out at an angle. Mount 
those in the holes in the bottom of the rear overhead locker, I thought, 
and they would aim the sound more forwards. I haven't done this yet 
because, I thought, they would also hang down about 2&quot; further than the 
existing flush mounted ones and block some rear view visibility (which is 
already at a premium in a Westfalia). 

Another idea: Get little bookshelf type speakers (from Radio Shack or 
wherever). Bungie cord them in place up in the poptop, one to each 
side. You'd have to move 'em when you pop the top, but most of the time 
you've got an extra 6&quot; headroom up there to put speakers in pretty good 
position for front and rear without blocking any precious visibility.
Or MacGiver a more elegant mode of hanging than bungie cords.

Or how about little (or big) monitor-style floor speakers sitting just in 
front of the rear bench seat and facing forwards and up? Good stereo 
position, especially for those in the front seat. Not much legroom lost 
to those in the back. Nondestructive installation (no cutting). And if 
passengers in the back want tunes too, you can just move 'em forward for 
optimal stereo imaging while they are riding, then put 'em back wagain 
when it's just you in the front seat.

If you removed the guts of the dead electric 'frig, you'd have lots of
room in the cabinet just aft of the cooler to mount big amplifier, CD
changers, and other paraphernalia.

Man, writing this makes me want to get serious about actually dealing 
with replacement of my slowly failing, very old, tired system that eats 
tapes and had no treble on the port side. Maybe this weekend...
