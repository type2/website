&gt;I just found out this weekend (before we had this beautiful  Snow, NOT!)

Think positive.  I would almost trade the 20-30mph winds here in Dallas for your snow about now.  :)

&gt;But when i removed the air filter
&gt;housing (i was stuck at the corner store-engine was flooded) saturday, i
&gt;saw that the carbs (mostly the right one) were dripping fuel from:
&gt;http://pages.infinit_dot_net/engine/test/carb201.jpg
&gt;Those 2 location for at least 1 minute (engine stop and fuel line
&gt;disconnected) resulting in an engine flooding!!!!!!! (like i said,
&gt;mostly the right one).

I know you know this but for the benefit of others: The location on the left is the main fuel draw that comes from the bowl through the main jet.  The nozzle on the right comes from the accelerator pump.  The only way those could be dripping fuel with the engine off is if the bowl is pressurized.  I suspect that the needle valves in the bowl are not adjusted properly, resulting in some residual pressure from the fuel pump which causes the flooding.  I know you're tired of working on these carbs, but you need to 1) verify fuel pressure (excess pressure could overload the needle valves and is not uncommon) and 2) verify correct operation of the needle valves.  If you have to, you can briefly start the bus with the fuel lines disconnected and plugged (with the bowls full of gas) then shut it off after a few seconds and see if the flooding problem happens again.  If not, you have narrowed it down quite a bit.

&gt;Secondly, i am tired of those carb and i wil buy new one, probably the
&gt;Dual Weber 34mm, i don't see any other brands out there and i don't want
&gt;any used one!!

My opinion follows:  The Solexes have their problems, but when they are running right, they run very, very well.  Don't let this problem get the best of you - be persistent and fix the current problem before you dump a lot of money into a (potentially) new set of problems.
