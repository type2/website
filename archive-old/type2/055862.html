I dont know how deep you went in disassembly before you started, but you
should have the parcel shelf out (4 bolts) and can then get in to remove the
speedo cable from the back of the speedo.  The end will not fit through the
parcel shelf, so if you really NEED it all the way out, you will have to
remove the speedo cable from the left front wheel hub.  It is a press fit and
if you cant seem to pull it out, just remove the hubcap and push on the end
that is exposed in a square hole in the center of the hub cover while someone
pulls it from the other side.  You can remove the speedo from the pod and
should be able to get the shaft in to position.  I do not believe that the pod
itself can be removed.
