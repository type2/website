68 is one-year-only. They have 67 outside handles and the lock knob on top
of the sill!

The hinge change happened in mid 76. vin # 2X6 2132 632
and up.

69 to 73 should be the same.

The lock knob/rod thru the sill is a 113 part #. It was used on 68 to the
end, vin # 2X8 220 000 and 74 and up, starting vin # 2X4 2000 01
On another note.... a 73 showed up today at a self-serve yard here in
Fresno, Calif. with good doors. I am not sure what shipping would be...

&gt; Hello list.
&gt;
&gt;  I want to thank everyone for their response on the
&gt; rust free doors that I inquired about. I have another
&gt; annoying question. Are all doors compatable from
&gt; 1968-1979 on transporters? I heard wispers that some
&gt; door hinges will not work with different models. If
&gt; so, what doors are compatable with a 1973 transporter?
&gt; If I am completely wrong, please excuse me.
