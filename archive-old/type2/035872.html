Tony writes with a tip about all-metal filler, then adds:

&gt;(we only wanna do this once, right?)

Would that it were so. I have been wracking my brain for over a year 
trying to figure out how to do a weld-in repair to this corner given my 
current living arrangements. Best I could think of was to cut a corner 
out of a junkyard donor, leave some &quot;tabs,&quot; cut out my corner leaving 
some &quot;tabs,&quot; pop rivet them together getting a perfect joint, then drive 
to a welder who would get to have the fun of welding the panels and then 
charge me for it. And would I find someone who would or could hammer 
weld? 

Finally, I got tired of going over the same ground and pulled the dent 
and filled it. Someday I will live somewhere where I can do the welding, 
and I will redo it, and I'll almost certainly fill it with the real 
all-metal filler: solder.
