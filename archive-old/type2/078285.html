Subject: Re: [T2] Intake Runner Gaskets

I don't think this will work. These blocks (sorry I don't have the
part number on hand here, but I also bought them form BusBoys) are
about 7mm (just guessing, so no one quote me on that) thick. It is a
gasket as well as a spacer. You would have to pile up many layers of
gasket material to accomplish this. Oh, also it's a very solid piece
of material so it doesn't give much at all.
