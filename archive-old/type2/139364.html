In my VW driving history I've had engines die in traffic quite a few times.
I've had engines SIEZE at speed twice. Once was a sucked #3 exhaust valve
that wedged the piston rather than beating a hole in it and one was a rod
thrown through the case when, apparently, the oil cooler became plugged up
and oil starved the engine without lighting the idiot light.

I can tell you which I prefer real quick. The bug that siezed did OK -- the
clutch was old and slipped so when the engine stopped turning I just
coasted to the side of the road. The bus I had that threw a rod had a new
clutch and almost tossed me into the windscreen when it siezed. It came to
a bucking, thumping, stop in traffic within a very short distance.

When an engine dies I tend to instinctively toss the gear shift into
neutral and head for the side of the road. When it just dies as from loss
of power I have time to do that. It stops the engine from turning while
allowing me to coast to safety.

The Raby engine I lost was due to a flat stick (piece of a board probably)
that flipped up into the (not properly sealed -- my fault entirely because
I HAD to use the bus as a daily driver) engine compartment and was fired by
the fan through the oil cooler. At 70mph I probably emptied the sump in
under 10 seconds. I heard the rod knock before I saw the idiot light and
the engine was toast. With that type of catastrophic oil loss even the
cutout may not have saved the motor -- but it might have saved more of it
and reduced the rebuild cost (I think only the heads were saved from the
long block -- everything inside the case, and the case, was scored and beat
up too bad).

I should have clarified that I don't expect it to be a simple circuit.
We've all experienced oil light flicker after returning to idle from a long
high speed run at one time or another. I'll have to put something in there
to account for that. Something that makes the relay stay energized even
with the &quot;patial ground&quot; caused by pressure low enough to cause the light
to flicker but not come on solid. That's for the engine kill circuit.

For the fuel pump circuit I'll add a pushbutton bypass that allows me to
run the fuel pump if I don't see the light go out during the first few
seconds of starter operation. Having the fuel pump &quot;ficker&quot; at idle after
the engine is running shouldn't matter much. I may need to rethink that if
it happens often in a few years as the engine gets &quot;tired&quot; to protect the
pump motor but I shouldn't be seeing a flickering light for a while.

All the relay sockets I buy have a diode pre-installed across the power
leads.
