Apologies to anybody who's heard this before, but I must have recited my
problems about 5 times on the internet.

I went off on holiday to France a couple of years back and pulling south of
London it just died. Waited a while and it started up fine and I bravely
continued onto the ferry and drove 1000 miles into Spain. Every couple of
days it would do it again, just die but it would come back after a wait. Got
back home and the problem persisted. Sometimes the power would go down,
others it would competely shut off.

Had various &quot;experts&quot; play with the carb, fitted new coil, and I replaced
the fuel pump, fuel filter. In the end I fitted a clear filter in the engine
compartment so I could see what was happening, and it was definitely a fuel
starvation problem.

Somebody suggested an electric pump, and this seemed to delay the onset of
the problem, though it still kept happening and it was taking longer to get
going again. The only thing left was to pull the tank. My 79 has no
removable bottom outlet.

Inside was a piece of newspaper.  It was I imagine getting sucked over the
outlet and blocking it off but floating free after a while.

If you start messing around with fuel lines please for God's sake be
extremely cautious about dripping fuel. There was a guy in our village
burned to death when working on his camper a couple of years back.
