Subject: 1974 VW Bus

Although it seems like a lot of work.......DO THE FUEL LINES FIRST.  I have
seen several old busses and other vw's ruined where a new owner decides to
try to get it to run without this and has an engine fire............

I just replaced my lines on my (new to me ) 412, and it took
forever.......must have been 10 feet of line.  But when I took off the old,
It was amazing how brittle some of it was, and trully would have burst in
short order had I tried to run the car with any kind of fuel pressure in
them.

Be safe then sorry............If you do swap the lines it is a great idea to
take compressed air and blow out the hardlines...............i often connect
the fuel pump to 12V and just run the pump to slosh fuel thru the ring
(without injectors pulsing) and swap the fuel filter...........shakes a lot
of crustus out of the tank before actual running the car..................
