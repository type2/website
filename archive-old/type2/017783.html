CALIFORNIA ALERT!!!!!!!
SAVE YOUR AIR SUCKER FROM THE CRUSHER!

On April 20, 1999 we, the car hobbyist, lost a very important fight!
SB2585 introduced by Senator Mountjoy, would make us exempt from remote
road side sensors was defeated.  We are now subject to losing our
vehicles is they can’t pass Smog Check II, and remember, you will have
only one chance to pass or no renewal of registration.  (In some
California cities, local ordinances prohibit unlicensed vehicles from
any part of the property including “locked” garages.)

The Bureau of Automotive Repair (BAR) and the California Air Resources
Board (CARB) have an avowed position to remove all vehicles from the
road that are over ten (10) years old!  Nothing so far has caused any
change or amendment to their Long Term Goal!

ONLY YOUR ACTION CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE!

If you haven’t taken action before now, don’t wait any longer or the
next step you may have to take….will be to the crusher”!

We Must Stand Together to “Save our Cars&quot;
