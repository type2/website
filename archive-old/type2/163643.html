Subject: Re: [T2] Turbo Bay

Wow - they mention all those body mods are in necessity rather than for
looks. they definitely put some low &quot;ground effects&quot; on that bus (5&quot;) - not
quite sure if it constitutes as ground effects, more like body mod...but I
wish i had that engine! A 2.7 911 Turbo RSR engine!!! DAAAAAMN!!!

that site doesn't go into detail about the suspension mods - &quot;...The
suspension was also lowered 3 inches and good gas shocks installed...&quot; maybe
its just me, but it seems like they have the rest of the bus worked out with
engine, trans, body mods but are lacking on suspension....

I ordered myself a set of the konis ($ouchy$) and as far as Ive read -
BusZilla will handle like a dream....as anything over 95 gets really
scary....granted i have bigger tires, no lowering and a big riviera top to
help push me around in my lane, but maybe i will be one step ahead than this
bus, at least on suspension :)
