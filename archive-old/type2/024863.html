Just exploring all my options here...Anyone in
Colorado/Nebraska/Wyoming/kansas interested in purchasing an '82 Westy-
Complete- needs a tranny, a new head, and possibly a new pop-top(negotiable-
I've got one w/ good canvas that I might part w/) The guy says it's in good
condition, 7 on a scale of 1-10. It's a California vehicle-no rust or major
dents. $650 (that is to pay for it to be shipped from California) I can help
w/ lining up the new or used parts needed to get it running. I can also store
it indefinitely until you are ready for it. Possibly could deliver if
reasonable distance, you could even work on it at my house if necessary!  E-me
if interested
Thanks
