Subject: Re: [T2] Heating possiblities


&gt;Has anyone thought about an oil-to-water heat exchanger? Cool your oil
&gt;while heating the bus? I know ac VW buses don't have any water in them
&gt;normally, but I've drawn out a plan for a dc-powered heat
&gt;exchanger/water pump setup, using dc solenoids to control the flow of
&gt;oil thru the system and allowing the exhausting of heat in summertime
&gt;when heat is not wanted in the cabin. It's dooable!

I'd love to hear if this kind of madcap scheme actually works. Right now I'm 
thinking of a propane heater, so the (hypothetical, as of yet unpurchased) 
tank can double for heat and cooking. I just got back from a 30 minute drive 
in middle of the night Utah winter weather; it took close to 20 just to 
defog the windows completely. When I got out to the vehicle, there was frost 
not only on the outside, but the /inside/ of the windshield, which I have 
never seen before in my life. Luckily, after a bit of driving, I reached the 
comfortably numb phase where you can no longer feel the cold, and shortly 
after that, a nice warm wave passed over me as my body passed through the 
numb stage into the so-cold-it-burns phase.

Who needs more than the stock heater when the body provides such a 
remarkable system of its own?
