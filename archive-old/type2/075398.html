Subject: 78 FI Wiring Problem....

Hello all,
	I am in desperate need of your help.  I have a 78 bus that used to run
fine.  I, without giving it thorough thought, dismantled my dashboard, and
undid all the wiring.  The were alot of shorts and it was in dire need of
being rewired correctly.  Well, I got a new job and did not have time to
finish the job.  I took it to a shop where they were able to succesfully get
everything back together except for the fuel injection part of the wiring at
the fuse box.  I just tried contacting them to get details but they left
shop already.  What I am hoping for is that there is someone in the area
that has a 78 (or close) Type 2 that I could take pictures of the wiring to
use.  Or, is there anywhere that I can get the schematics to show me how to
rewire it.  Most wiring diagrams don't show it in detail enough.  Keep in
mind that every wire was removed from its connections.  Any help will be
greatly apprectiated, and yes, I promise to never do this again without more
preparation.

Thanks

Troy Wical

78 T2
