Subject: Re: [T2] Sell the van?! 

[...]

&gt;You
&gt; take the bus to Mom's house and park it in the back yard.  &gt;Go to
&gt; school in the Escort, come home on vacations and drive the &gt;bus.  Put
&gt; it back and go back to school.


Yeah - thats the most logical.  Stash it and visit it when you can.  You'll miss it if you sell it - although i've always thought you guys who own (and love) 72 model busses are wierdos anyway - what with the lack of an engine hatch and all. ;-p

You're asking the wrong group if want to be convinced to sell your bus. Your parents may help to convince you to sell it, but there are more of us than there are of them. ;-P

I think about it sometimes too - i'm 29, got a 3-year old boy - 20G in student loans, make under 25k a year, but the damn bus will sit in my yard until i've got the time and money to give it the attention it needs.  I wanted it, i got it, i rebuilt the engine on my kitchen table and i'll be damned if i'm just gonna get off the horse and walk...

I'm never happy when i think about selling the bus - i always end up at 'Ok -maybe you can't drive it as much as you'd like right now - what the hell is it hurting just sitting there?'  and i realize that selling the bus was *someone else's idea* and then i respectfully kick them out of my head!

keep your bus.
