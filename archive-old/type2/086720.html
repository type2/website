Subject: Re: [T2] VW shop in Maryland?


The shop is Dick's VW. He has a lot of busses andused parts, does good work
and has fair prices. I have bought a lot of parts from him and have
referred people to him for years. Some have said his prices were a little
high, but he always gave me really good deals. It may be because of all the
people I have sent him...He is located off rt 50 on the eastern shore. I
cant remember the name of the turn off road. His number is 410-827-6501
