hi all..

i have a little perdicament im stuck in right now.
Lately, I haven't had the time to work on my bus. Since it was lacking any
braking ability whatsoever, I decided to have it towed to the local vw guy
and have him do the brakes. I have been working on this bus for about a
year now off and on, bought it last summer without an engine. Its a '74. I
installed the 1.8 FI '75 engine from my old bus (RIP).

anywho..... I had it towed over this morning. He called be at aobut 3:30
and told me what he was doing and what needed to be done:
