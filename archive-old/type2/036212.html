I think they would work with bus wheels. If I remember correctly, they are 5-bolt, too. And I think that I have seen Porsche alloys on buses before.
List, am I right or way off?

thats not a bad idea...the only draw back i can see (at least trying to
visualize the process in my head) would be that you would need to also use
the porsche wheels to bolt up to the 944 rear disc brake assembly.  or does
a pors. wheel fit the late bays?  having rear discs would be a step in the
right direction.
