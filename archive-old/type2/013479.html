Subject: Subaru 1800 in a 71

List,
I'm about 95% convinced its gonna be cheaper in the long run and 100% excited
about installing a Subaru engine in my 71 Adventurewagen.
The engine is in a 2wd wagon - 87-88 I think. Haven't looked closely, but I’m
fairly certain  that the year would make it the ea81 - 1800 DOHC carb ?

Anyway, a local conversion-crazy buggy shop can sell me the adapter plate, a
modded flywheel and pilot bushing for $300.  These guys seem to get good life
out of the conversions - usually mated up to a late model bus tranny.  Haven't
priced the Kennedy stuff yet, but I will.

My questions, which I hope will get some response, are as follows:

1.Rear engine support - has anyone done this? Should I be able to use a modded
bus hanger bar?

2. My bus originally had AC and the condensers are mounted between the frame
members (under the cargo floor) with a 12v fan blowing down through it. There
is a galvanized cover running between the members that is louvered open
towards the front of the bus.  Looks like an ideal spot for the radiator - run
the fan all the time.  Any thoughts? Will she cool with a stock jap rad?

3. There is some talk of using the suby bellhousing.  Why?  Won't the adapter
plate allow me to mate the engine right up to the tranny?

4. Exhaust. Am I looking at a complete fabrication?  Something like this looks
attractive as far as muffler goes: http://www.motorworks_dot_com/images/p9589B.JPG
.
Any experiences/suggestions?

Thanks for any and all input.
I really feel that this is the best way to go for me. I want to put this thing
in once and not cringe very time I step on the accelerator pedal.
