Subject: RE: [T2] Need '78 crossover pipe
Mime-Version: 1.0

Oops. I forgot to post this to the list last time, and just mailed 
itdirectly to Ron. Sorry Ron.

&gt; &gt; Also, Ron at BD, could you please pmail me with your pitch and pricing for
&gt; &gt; converting to this to the earlier/'79 federal exhaust system.

I am looking at replacing the exhaust on my '77 and noticed that parts for 
the stock system seemed to be difficult to obtain. I have an exhaust leak 
somewhere that causes my bus to backfire on heavy deceleration, and this 
makes me VERY unhappy. I understand that this can cause lots of problems 
(broken air intake sensor, destroyed valves, etc). I did find one hole in 
the muffler that I have patched, however the problem has not gone away. Any 
suggestions on how to figure out where the leak is coming from so I can 
keep driving her until I get the new exhaust. She is my daily driver now 
which just complicates the situation.

&gt;Convert it to the 72-74 setup. Put '72-74 heat exchangers and exhaust on
&gt;it..  $179 buys you a complete exhaust system with a stainless steel
&gt;muffler.  You can replace both heat exchangers for $349 (one side German one
&gt;side Danish) or $399 (both sides NOS German, worth the difference).  You
&gt;will have to do minor cooling tin fabrication, and disable your EGR filter,
&gt;otherwise everything bolts right up.

What exactly does &quot;minor cooling tin fabrication&quot; mean? How much work is 
involved with such a venture. I am pretty new to a lot of this stuff and 
learning fast (thanks to the list) but this statement frightens me quite a bit.

What are the ramifications both legally and in terms of performance of 
getting rid of the EGR filter?

I have just recently moved to Sacramento, and have yet to register my bus 
here. It is a federal bus, but my concern is that California will balk if I 
have modified the exhaust system in this way. When I sniffed it in AZ it 
passed with flying colors, but they just check for CO2 and HC. Does anybody 
know if CA checks for NOx?

Performance wise I would think that the lack of EGR would increase 
performance but cause the bus to run hotter. I understand from the archives 
that it is almost impossible to buy a new EGR valve, and it is impossible 
if you aren't independently wealthy. Is this correct?

I have also recently been noticing a slightly irregular idle. That is, it 
fluctuates slightly around where it decides to idle, and it also decides to 
idle at slightly different places. Sometimes it idles at 850, and some 
times it will idle as high as 1100. I have been searching for the cause of 
this, but have not tracked it down yet. Possibilities that I have run 
across are too much end play, and a faulty EGR valve. The end play I intend 
to check when I do the exhaust, but that may be a month or two off due to 
cash flow right now. If it is the EGR valve and I stop up the hose will the 
irregularity disappear? Any other suggestions for why I would see this, or 
how to correct it?

Finally, thanks to all the gurus on this list. I find the list invaluable, 
and thank you all for passing on your knowledge of these fantastic 
vehicles. Sorry this is so long.

-Nick
