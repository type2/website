Subject: Tom Noble Rebuild

I just had to say something when I read about someone with a Tom Noble 
Rebuild. Of course its GOOD.

A bus I bought a few years back came with a Tom Noble. It was a 69 
Westy. That engine had been driven 45,000 miles then sat for 6 years in 
the bus outside in the elements in the Seattle Area ( I got the 
paperwork on it when I bought the bus, numbers matched) The owner had 
started it once in a while for a couple years, then let it sit. He 
probably did more damage then good.
I drove the bus for a year, then put in a 1641. The Noble motor sat 
outside my house for 2 years with a half assed job of keeping it 
covered. Then I needed it again when I sold that bus and put it in my 
63. When I first started it up, it even foamed for awhile, due to the 
water that had gotten in it. I have since put on another 40,000 miles or 
so, and not easy ones at that. Day to day driving, and long trips, such 
as twice over the continental divide at 8,000 ft and once up to 10,000 
feet. Many mountain passes have been climbed with that motor. Although 
it is showing signs of wear, what can you expect after abuse in a little 
1600 single port, it still pushes along, although with a little more oil 
then in the past.
Just had to say something!
Way to go Tom Noble Rebuilders!
Jason
