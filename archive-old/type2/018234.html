Janyce (and list);

Is anyone concerned about combustion (flamability) of putting this stuff in the
engine compartment?  Not that  it would start on fire by itself, but that if a
fire started, it would seem to provide an excellant material to burn....

Whitney claims that theirs is &quot;flame retardant&quot;;  I've ordered some and I was
going to test it before I start installing.
