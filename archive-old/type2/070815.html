ONE WEEK AWAY --
Beads, Bellbottoms &amp; VWs
The fourth anniversary of this event promises to be bigger than ever. We
cut the corners of four states in two days doing VW shop tours, VW bone
yard tours, etc. while being offered VW parts sales &amp; new Mexican Beetle
test drives. We'll eat at almost every stop and most of it is free.
We'll learn about upcoming VW shows, smile for the cameras and provide
interviews for Newspapers &amp; TV. There'll be  awards for Coolest Hippie
Dude, Coolest Hippie Chick, Coolest Hippie Couple, Youngest Hippie,
Oldest Hippie and Coolest Seta Wheels with dash plaques for the first 50
VWs. Event shirts will be for sale - everything else, except your
expenses, is free. Join us for the entire route or join us at any time
for part of it. Get your map &amp; schedule at
http://www.avwa_dot_com/avwa/hippiedays.htm or call (423) 429-8009.
