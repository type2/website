Joseph:

It is not just a rumor, it's true.  Bus Boys has been under new management
for the past year.  Our former general manager is gone and we are dedicated
to better meeting the needs of our customers.

Thank you!

Included in Josephs' message was the following:

&gt; Bus Boys has had a bad reputation among list members in the past. I heard
that they're under new management, but for many of us, they probably still
have something to prove even if they are...and I haven't heard from the guy
at the Bus Boys address that they're under new management; just a rumor on
the list. By all means, step out and do business with them and report back
to us, many of whom are too shy to send them money or credit card numbers
in the wake of casualties laying along the roadside. Takes a long time to
repair that level of bad press.
