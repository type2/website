Here's my $0.02 (US) worth.

I do a LOT of fishing all the Columbia River tributaries of 
southern Washington and driving in extreme conditions.  Some of
them have been 110 F weather and a 3 hour drive in it in a loaded
'77 hardtop Westy. 

I had a later model Super Beetle that was packed with 2 college guys
and their stuff (I'd estimate that I STILL had more weight in cargo
and people than they did) go by me on a down hill run.  I passed them
on the next uphill run and I was doing 60MPH to their estimated 45MPH.

Hey, if a Super Beetle isn't a type 1, sorry, but I'm strictly a fan of
pancakes with FI. &lt;G&gt; 

The moral of my story?  While an upright may be cheaper to get parts
and labor for, the late '70s pancakes and fuel injection crank out
more ponies.  On a stock motor, that is.  &lt;G&gt;  Also, with FI,
there's no carb jets or chokes to dink with.  My dad had a pancake
with a carb on it and it had to be adjusted every fall and spring.

Hey, can you tell WHICH engine I'M sold on?

Mark
