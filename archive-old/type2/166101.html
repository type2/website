That is interesting.  I guess the pump would cart cavitating, huh?

&gt; I'm not sure whether the fuel return inside a FI tank extends a distance
&gt; away from the outlet or not.  I suggested extending the modified EFI

It's about an inch away from the inlet, and it also gets held in a cup 
so I'm sure a bunch gets recirculated.  However, the rest of the fuel in 
the tank probably cools it down quite a bit.

Interesting stuff...
