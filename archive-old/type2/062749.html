Subject: Re: 1959-61 Kombi middle seat value?? 

I have a lead on a &quot;NOS quality&quot; middle seat that is correct for a 
1959-61 bus. It is in perfect condition and is in the correct original 
&quot;grey&quot; vinyl. Seat was taken out of bus  by OO (original owner) and was 
never used, has sat in garage for 35 years. what do people think it is 
worth? Anybody ever seen a correct _kombi_ middle seat for sale in 
comparable condition?
