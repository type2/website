Subject: Re: [T2] Little plastic sliders  -  Curtain installation materials

Trying to cover 2 inquiries with 1 post...

Marine and RV joints carry RECMAR brand curtain &quot;hardware&quot;.  The sliders are
almost identical to the original sliders installed by Westfalia, and fit the
original Westfalia tracks perfectly.

RECMAR packages their curtain hanging materials in kits.  You can choose the
track length you want and the correct number of sliders, etc., are included.

I have here a kit with a pair of 36&quot; tracks, plus all the necessary sliders,
mounting screws, and end stops.  The kit cost $6.99 at Boater's World.  The
track is identical to that installed by Westfalia over the front doors of
bay-window campers.  It would work just fine for adding curtains to a bus,
as the plastic tracks are flexible and [obviously] rust proof.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  ...does anyone have a handful of those original sliders they would be
willing to part with?  &lt;&lt;
