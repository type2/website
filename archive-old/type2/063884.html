Subject: Doh!  Screen Was There!!

Hey Volks!  (I like that!!)

Well, after posting my question about my first valve/oil change on my
'70 bus, I received numerous messages from concerned people.  Thanks to
all you guys &amp; gals! 

I went under tonight and drained the oil, removed the plate, and...doh!
I just didn't pull out the piece with the screen on it the first
time...I guess I was expecting (from reading Muir) the screen to be
right on top of the plate...

Oh well, at least I have peace of mind now!!

Thanks again!
