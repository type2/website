Subject: [T2] Metrinch tools, good???

Volks,

I just got my JC Whitney catalog, and amongst the yummies, I spotted a 
metrinch tool set. Searched the library and the archives with no real hits. 
Anyone care to give me a &quot;road test impression&quot; on these?

For the price, I expect that I could buy both metric and inch sets, but the 
savings in weight and space (for the metrinch)is appealing.

I would want them to be just as effective as real metric tools, as my teenage 
son would pack these as the only set in the bus. Of course, every need isn't 
covered, so I would make up the missing items for his toolkit.

TIA and Cheers/Don Carron
