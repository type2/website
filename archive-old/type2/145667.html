Subject: Re: [T2] Carbs, FI or? ... And weird heads

Hi Marcus,

If they're 4-bolt intakes then I'd say the heads are from a 411 or 412 with
D-Jet fuel injection. If they are 3-bolt then they are Porsche as Mark stated.
Those are what we have on the engine we are using for Franklin, my Dad's Baja
bus project. It came from a 411 and had the complete D-jet setup on it.

According to this page:
http://www.tunacan_dot_net/t4corner/history/rt_feb71_1.shtml
The D-jet equipped 411 T4 engine could put out 85 HP and 99 ft lbs of torque.

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts

   Another question: The heads on this engine have breather fittings on them
  (to be connected to a central breather box somewhere in the engine
  compartment). Looks like they were manufacturerd like that. Previous owner
  says they are Brazilian heads. I have never seen anything like that before -
  what are these heads?
