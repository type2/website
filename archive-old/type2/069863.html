Subject: Priming Hydraulic Lifters

Howdy peoples....

I am pleased to announce that my dreaded lifter (taktaktak) problem is going 
away....it is now under control.  For a moment, I thought that I was suffering 
from the &quot;head self-destruction blues&quot;, but it seems that re-priming the lifters 
is the solution to my particular racket.  

For those who replied that I should just run it until it goes away, I must 
advise you that my clatter was quite loud, and damage to the valve train, 
pushrods, and lifters could potentially ensue..(this from the local VW guru).

I do have an easy (sorta) system for priming the lifters that is easier than 
what it sez in the books.  And don't let anyone tell you that once they 
collapse, you need to replace them!  They're probably trying to sell them, 
right?  Check 'em yourself!  If they don't show overt signs of wear, you can 
probably fix them...

Here's what I did:    (Be most patient...correct me if I'm wrong...me no liable, 
etc....  :&gt;)

*Remove the lifter(s)
*Carefully take out the circlip (it tends to fly away..)
*Using a tiny screwdriver with a little bend in the tip, pull out the top 
plunger thingy(check for wear/damage)
*Immerse the rest of the lifter in new oil at least up past that oil hole in the 
side
*Using a small, stiff, (NON-ABRASIVE!!) rod, depress the little ball-valve in 
the center of the plunger until all air has apparently left, and it seems full 
of oil
*Using the same rod, with the lifter still immersed in oil, push the plunger 
down until you can get a bent piece of (round) metal(I used some wierd bent 
tweezers) into the oil hole to hold the plunger down.
*Fill the rest of the lifter with oil, place the top plunger in, and sorta push 
down(oil and some air will squirt out the hole)while removing the bent piece of 
metal until the top of the plunger clears the groove, and replace the circlip.
*Press down on the plunger with your thumb as hard as you can...if it does not 
budge, you were successful!
*Store vertically (and keep spotless) until you are ready to re-install.  It is, 
of course best if you put it back where it came from.

Hope this helps someone...
