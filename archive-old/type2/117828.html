Subject: Re: [T2] {FRIDAY} VW Cost Cutting was: LED Tail Lights

Folks, my nomination is for the funky air pressure squirter
system.  VW continued this long after they should have switched to 
the more &quot;modern&quot; electrical pump system.

May not seem to be a big thing to some, but when you need it...you 
generally need it badly.  By going to an electric pump system, you could 
eliminate the valve in the turn signals with a simple contact and 
you would remove a lot of rubber tubing that tends to leak after
X years....BTW, I really like it when the tubing goes and sprays 
washer water all over your crotch, or down your leg  when you least need 
it!  LOL!

Cheers, dave
