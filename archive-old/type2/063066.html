Subject: Type 2 Wavers (was Cool! (Lots of splitties...)) 

Robert,

I don't drive a splitty and I haven't seen any local splitties in this small 
town 3 hours west of Sydney, although we see the occasional splitty 
traveller going through.

However, on the subject of waves I have noticed that most of the town's 
breadloaf drivers will wave to me. I definitelly don't get waves from the 
drivers of waterboxers and other Caravelles (you call them Vanagons, a 
marketing mistake if ever there was one). 

Male Caravelle drivers must think they're superior to breadloaf owners, 
cos they definitely don't wave. Lady Caravelle drivers seem to be hassled 
looking mothers rushing to some important school or shopping task or, at 
least in this town, long haired, long skirted Plymouth Brethren ladies 
driving around with their large families. Waving at some old bearded guy 
in a battered Kombi is the last thing they'd be thinking of.

When I once said to my kids that I would like a Caravelle (before 
I got my '72 bus) they said &quot;Noooo! You're not getting a feathery machine!&quot;.

On the highway, the same rules seem to apply. Ladies with kids don't 
wave, even if they're in breadloafs, blokes in breadloafs wave. 

I'm going to the coast in a couple of weeks and it will be interesting to 
see who waves over there. I know that's there are heaps more Type 2s on 
the coast. 

Will surfers wave? Time will tell.
