Subject: Re: heat exchanger gasket thingie

&gt;when i pulled my heat exchangers off there was the remains 
&gt;of some sort of seal between the fan housing &amp; the metal of 
&gt;the exchanger. this is on a 79 micro w/ a 2 liter. the area 
&gt;i am talking about is right where those little flappers are 
&gt;it on the bottom of the fan housing. does anyone have a p/n 
&gt;or something to help me pick up a new one?

A lot of folks don't even know there used to be a seal there because their's 
was long-rotted away when they got it.  It is a GOOD idea to have a seal 
because without it the small flap piece will eventually rub a hole right 
through the softer metal of the fan housing.

I've had good luck with rubber weather-stripping from Home Depot.  Not the foam-
rubber type, but a solid white rubber that is used for re-stripping windows.  
It's self-adhesive and just about the right size.  I pulled the exhangers off 
my 914 a few months back and the seals were still in place after 20,000 miles 
and 2 years.
