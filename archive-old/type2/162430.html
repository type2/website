&gt; Q:   Is there any opportunity to use a canoe if I take one to Natural  Bus??
&gt;
&gt; Hey guy  I just got on here at work  yes there are plenty of  canoeing places
&gt; at naturalbus  the campground will even shuttle you or you  can rent a canoe
&gt; from them.  there is an easy class 1 run above the  campground ,  below the
&gt; campground is a class 3 run .  20 miles away  is Goshen pass on the Maury river
&gt; which is one of the best whitewater runs in  the state, class 5 when it has
&gt; water. It drops 80 feet per mile and has some  serious rapids.  sorry for being

is that where you wanted to have this canoe race???


bring your canoe to John Brown's Buses, for the 1st sort of annual bus
operators canoe sinking (er I mean race)

  nice flat water area on the Potomac River
