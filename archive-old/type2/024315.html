Subject: 71 Westy POP TOP SEAL?
Message-ID: &lt;7k78rk$j1jn_at_eGroups_dot_com&gt;

I want to replace my seal, any suggestions where to mail order an inexspensive one? Also anyone know of a good way to cob job the rust holes especailly the wheel wells and floor boards and runners, I have some sheet metal riveted down but need to plug up any leaks. Bondo and sheet metal?, losing solid metal to attach it too. She runs great but the NE has taken a toll I hope to find a solid 71 Westy with a bad engine and do a transplant in a year or so. Thanks for the feedback!
