&gt;If using my $18.95 Hella Dual Battery Relay Kit (or a similar relay kit or
&gt;isolator), you will hook up those items that you wish the second battery to
&gt;power, directly to the second battery (via fuses, of course).  When the bus

A neat thing to mention here is that the Westy installation in the late
70's like most VW wiring did NOT feature a fuse or fused link in the
wire running over to the relay that was mounted on the driver side pillar
beside the tailight.  Furthermore the wiring tucked in the main bundle
running from right to left around the engine hatch.  The neat thing on the
'78 was when the wire to the relay got caught in the spring prop thing
and flame started shooting all over the place.  Of course all my fuel lines
were new, etc. and when it burnt through it just burnt out.  Took a while
though, big wire.

The point is, like Ron says, fuse the acessories running off the 2nd battery
but I'd take an american POV and fuse the wire over to the battery as well
right at the main battery.

This was nearly as cool as when the ignition switch with it's heavy gage
unfused lead went up in the '70 single cab.

Needless to say I'm sort of a supporter of adding fusible links even where
VW didn't feel they were necessary 30 years ago.  The insulation was a
lot newer then.
