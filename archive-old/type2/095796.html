I replaced the points and condensor in the stock distributor of my '79 =
bus with a Pertronix Ignitor in 1996. It's still working great. It's =
probably the best $60 I ever spent on the bus. (YMMV)

Compu-Fire also makes a version of its Hall effect points replacement =
unit that will fit the stock Bosch combination =
vacuum-/centrifugal-advance dizzy. I think it sells for about the same =
as the Pertronix Ignitor (~$60).

It is very nice to be able to skip the points/condensor replacement and =
ignition timing part of the tuneup procedure now. Doing a tuneup on the =
'79 bus with hydraulic lifters now involves changing only the spark =
plugs, rotor and dizzy cap every 25k miles or so. I also then lube the =
distributor advance plate, shaft and bearings, dizzy dog and swinging =
centrifugal advance weights in the bottom of the dizzy, etc. with =
synthetic gear oil.

I just ordered a Pertronix Flame-Thrower 40,000 volt coil and expect to =
replace the stock coil with it in a few days. I hope that it provides a =
little more power, better mileage, etc. As I understand it, Pertronix =

Hey guys,
I was thinking about replacing my points to an electronic igniter.  Is =
this
a good idea and if so what brand should I get?  I've heard that =
Pertronix
only has a 30 month warranty and that not all people have had that much
success with them.  That leaves me a little weary so is this something I
want to do?  Thanks
TARA
