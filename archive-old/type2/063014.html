Subject: Re: gas leak, 78, NEED ADVICE -- Thanks!!

I'd like to say thanks to everyone who gave me insight into what
exactly was going wrong with my vapor recovery system: David Lambdin,
Mark White, Scott Catlin, Paul Wies, Andrew Rath, and Jack Stafford.
And those are just the people who sent/cc'd their responses to me
directly--I haven't even gotten around to the digests that came in
last night!

The overwhelming concensus is that the vapor recovery tubing in the
fender/air scoop/pillar is NOT one piece, and up inside the pillar
there is a junction bridged by a short piece of rubber hose that is
almost definitely the culprit.  Given the state of the rest of that
rubber tubing when I replaced the gas tank, I'm sure you're all
correct, even without looking.  However, if anything different turns
up, I'm sure you'll all hear my shouts of surprise. :-)

Thanks to everyone for your help!
Rodney
