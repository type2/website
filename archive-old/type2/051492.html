You would be money ahead to have both.  Who does your repairs?  If you do,
one vehicle will have to sit while being repaired, the other can serve as a
parts chaser.  A VW does need more &quot;love&quot; than most modern vehicles, heck
the newest bay is over 30 years old!!

Also, why wear your bus out, save it for &quot;family&quot; trips and campouts.  Use
your little pickup for the dirty work.  Only keep liability insurance on
your pickup and that should save you money.  You should be able to have
both older vehicles for the price of one newer vehicle and no car payments.


&gt;		AS you know I have been looking for a Vanagon or late 70's
&gt;Westy so my family and I could go camping. After a long weekend of talking
&gt;with my wife we have come to the conclusion that VW just did not make a
&gt;camper that she would feel comfortable camping in with 3 kids and 2 dogs.
&gt;		I also had a small Jap truck, it is in need of a few things
&gt;and it does not seat all of our family. If we decide to go with a pop-top
&gt;tent trailer I would need to get a new truck. I hate not having a Bus, but I
&gt;also need a truck, a work truck. We have 1.2 acres and they always need
&gt;something.
&gt;		There has been a lot of talk about towing with a Bus and I
&gt;am wanting a little feed back on an idea. If I were to find a Double Cab VW
&gt;Bus, then get (or Rent) and pop-top trailer I could still drive a Bus, seat
&gt;all three Kids, and make my wife happy and still go camping.
&gt;		This is still not the perfect solution, but so far the best
&gt;of any I have had.
&gt;		So, am I crazy, would this work. I figure a 68-71 Double
&gt;Cab, or a Vanagon DC would work. I would love to find a 72-79 DC, but they
&gt;are rare in the USA(never imported by VW). If this is the way I go, I will
&gt;be looking for a solid, but not perfect DC. It will still see use hauling VW
&gt;parts, wood, gravel and other home improvement items. It would also delete 1
&gt;vehicle from the shop. I could have a Bus and a truck in just one DC.
&gt;(currently have a Truck and a Westy)
&gt;		Anyway, feedback would be good, I am wanting to do the best
&gt;thing for my family.
&gt;		P.S. Could I still camp with the West Westies if I tow a
&gt;trailer with a DC?
