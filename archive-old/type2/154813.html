Subject: Exhaust Questions + Free

Hey guys,

    I have a couple of questions. I currently have a Pace Setter dual exhaust
system on my Bus which I believe was meant for a Porsche 914. I just purchased
a brand new OEM style Pace Setter exhaust muffler/system. It's supposedly just
like the OEM replacement. It's currently painted semi-gloss black. I would
like to keep the muffler looking brand new and I wanted to know what you guys
recommended in terms of paint? The car spends ALL it's life in my garage
except the occasional time I take it for a spin on the weekends. It never sees
rain or any of that other stuff. I had thought about just painted the entire
muffler / system with black engine enamel from Dupli-Color. Do you think that
will work?

My other question is, does anyone in the South Florida area have any use for a
Porsche 914 / VW Bus exhuast system from Pace Setter? It's a dual exhaust with
dual twin tips. It's a bit too loud and doesn't look stock. The exhaust has
very low miles on it. (about 1,000 I believe). It's got some slight surface
rust just from sitting.

I can't ship it, but anyone in Fort Lauderdale that wants to pick it up is
welcome to it for free just e-mail me.


Thanks,

Todd
