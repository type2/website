Hi lists

Could I get anyone interested in meeting for pictures of list people at the
Classic? I know we go each year, and I always regret not meeting all these
people that I read each day. Maybe this year...

As an added inducement, those crazy Buskatiers are on their way here now
from Nebraska, and they surely would like to meet as many listers as
possible.

I think dan, of oceanstreet video will be there, again, and he usually has a
big tent pushing all of his terrific videos, and that should be a good
central place to meet. (Sure hope he doesn't mind, Dan?) How about noon?

A show of hands?
