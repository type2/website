Subject: Re: DC Busses/Get-together???

Hello,

Yeah that's the bus in Crystal City alright.  It's been there forever and 
I'm always tempted to ask around and find out it's story.  I would have done 
so long before now but I found two other buses and bought them instead.  I 
think I've seen your Champagne bus driving around.  I drive a yellow and 
white standard with a full rack, and a beat up looking 77 Westy that is 
mostly orange with a brown sliding door.  If you see me in your rear view 
mirror or circling your bus in a parking lot- not to worry, I'm just 
drinking in the sight of your bus, I'm not a lunatic...well maybe I am....  
:)

I've been thinking, since I posted about buses in the DC area several people 
on the list replied saying that they live in and around DC. I have been 
thinking about trying to organize a get-together on the Mall here in DC or 
something this coming Spring. It's a great vacation place with all the free 
museums and historical sights and monuments. It would be great to get a 
picture of the Washington Monument surrounded by buses.

If anyone is interested in helping me make this a reality please let me know 
so we can start planning in earnest.  I do better working as part of a team 
and will likely not pursue the idea without support.

Please email me at jeffreyned_at_hotmail_dot_com  if you want to set something up.
