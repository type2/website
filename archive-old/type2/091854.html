Subject: new England camper hire 

I wonder if anyone can help.

My partner and I are arriving in Boston on The 2nd of october and are looking to hire a type 2 camper for about 10 days. We live in london and have owned our own type 2 for about over 7 years. If anyone knows of any companies or individuals that could help us we would be very grateful for any help

Thanks for listening.

Stu
