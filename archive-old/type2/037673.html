Subject: Carburetors &amp; FI

Hi all,

Being in the process of tearing down my FI 2.0L type IV and a carbureted
motorcycle engine I would really like to know more about how carburetors and
FI work.  Can anyone suggest books or reference materials for me?  I'm
looking for real detail here if possible.  You know, physics, theory behind
spray patterns, air/fuel mixing, what all the jets are for and why they are
shaped the way they are etc...

TIA,
Niall
