&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt; 
&gt; I have a 2016cc engine all set and ready to go, BUT I am leaving for Italy
&gt; next Thursday and the engine will go in storage. Should I break the engine
&gt; in before I leave or should I let it wait a year before firing it for the
&gt; first time? The cam has not been hardened yet.

I'd break it in first.  This will oil-impregnate the minor porosities in
the engine and make sure that the seals are run in as well.

&gt; How would one go about pickling a new engine for that period of time. My
&gt; room-mate suggested that I remove the rockers to take off the spring
&gt; pressure. Should I put the vehicle up on jack stands? (Swing axle).
&gt; The vehicle is a 63 dunebuggy. It is going in a storage bin.

Visit an aircraft supply store and get some storage plugs.  These replace
your spark plugs with dessicators that will absorb water from the air in
the engine.  You can also put a bag of silica gel in the oil filler to
keep the cases dry.  Change the oil and put in the customary 2.5 quarts of
fresh oil.

For a year's storage, I'd fill the tank and put in Sta-Bil.  Much more
than this and I'd empty the fuel system entirely.  It's a coin-flip which
is better, since you are balancing gasoline going bad with the gaskets and
seals in the fuel system drying out.  You must also make absolutely sure
that the float valve in the carb is good.  If it isn't you'll return to a
crankcase full of gasoline.

Whenever you pickle a vehicle, be sure to leave notes on what you did
attached in some place where you can't avoid noticing it.  This makes sure
that you will unpickle it completely!  It would be a disaster to fire the
thing up with silica gel in the oil filler, for example!
