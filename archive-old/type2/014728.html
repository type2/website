Subject: what carbs Webers, or Kadrons

X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

Hello all,
  I have a delema, I am building an 1800cc type 4 for a 71 Bus. It will have
the Joe Cali upright conversion. I have two sets of carbs right now. One set
is Weber 34ICT's and the other is 40mm Kadrons. I found I can get type 4
manifolds for the Kadrons for $100 and have the type 4 manifolds for the
ICTs. 
  So what carbs would be best for this engine. The engine is a completely
stock 1800 except for the external upright conversion(stock compression and
cam, heat exchangers and all). Is one a better carb than the other, I know
the Webers have a much better linkage, but may sit way too low for this
conversion. The Kadrons are bigger and may make more HP, but are these
better for the type 1 than the type 4? 
  Please do not suggest that I junk them both, I do not have that kind of
money. I want IDAs, but I HAVE Webers and Kadrons. Shoe string is the best
discription of my budget.
