&gt;Hi Folks,
&gt;
&gt;As part of the process of getting my Bus running again, I'm adding a 
&gt;vacuum gauge and a cyl. head temp gauge.  Hooking up the gauges is not a 
&gt;problem, but getting them lit for night usage is.  I now have 6 gauges 
&gt;atop my dash (oil temp, oil press, vacuum, cyl head temp, voltmeter, 
&gt;clock), and the feed from the stock instrument panel isn't enough to light 
&gt;all of them.

Why not?

&gt;Is there a switched feed from the headlight switch or the fuse panel that 
&gt;I can splice into?

If I recall, that's where the dash lights get their power, from a terminal 
on the headlight switch.  Don't remember which one but it shouldn't be hard 
to figure out.  It will handle the load of two dozen of those little lights 
easily.  I have all of the gauges you mentioned above currently lit by 
tapping into the dash light wire and it has worked for years.
