Subject: Re FI Fuel Line Pressure 

&gt;Here's a sort of definitive answer to the question &quot;Does the fuel in my
&gt;VW fi system stay pressurized when the engine's off?&quot;

&gt;The Bosch book I have says yes.

&gt;&quot;High-pressure fuel is delivered through a check valve, which closes
&gt;when the fuel pump stops to hold pressure in the lines.
&gt;Constantly-pressured fuel lines ensure quicker restarts, and also help
&gt;prevent vapor lock.&quot;

&gt;This is, of course, why on newer cars there is a little warning label on
&gt;the gas cap that says to open the cap slowly as the fuel system is under
&gt;pressure.  Now, on my '78 bus, I've never heard the hiss that you get
&gt;with a pressurized system but I assume that the fuel lines are
&gt;constantly pressurized or else it would take forever to start and you'd
&gt;get vapor lock in the hot weather.

Sean: You should have quit while you were ahead. Point one is correct.
 
However the hiss when you open the fuel tank cap is due to a system that 
removes fuel vapors from the tank. This is an emission control feature 
I believe the tank is under a very slight vaccuum, not pressure.
You are confusing the high pressure lines downstream of the fuel pump, and
the tank. Trust me, your fuel tank is not pressurized to 40PSI.

BTW I think that if you have all the vent lines, charcoal canister ......
emmisions type stuff working correctly, even a later bus will suck when the
tank lid is removed. However, having never seen one intact, I don't know.
I do know that the fuel tank vents are indirectly connected to the intake 
tract. Whether there is a valve to hold the vaccuum when the van is off, I
don't know, but when the van is running, I believe your fuel tank sucks;-)

Send me a 76 FI wiring harness, and I'll do some research, and report back;-)

Snow minus five weeks, and counting. I don't want to tow it to storage!
