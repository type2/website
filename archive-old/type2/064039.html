Subject: GEX Update and Air Flow Meter Question

Hi all: The GEX has been in the Westy for  about a week and half now. After
a few tweaks (which I will come to in a moment) the engine appears to be
running well and much better than before. Power and mileage are both there
and the engine is quieter. The mechanic recommended I change the oil after
about 300 miles which comes up this weekend. I will speak to Larry of GEX
today and get his diagnosis on the failed heads.

On the airflow meter: After installation the engine was running extremely
rich (4% according to the mechanic). 12-15 mpg was the order of the day. I
followed all the recommended procedures and checked for  leaks, ensured the
timing was correct and checked for open injectors. I then stumbled upon Dan
Houg's discussion of how the air flow meter can be adjusted to reduce
emissions. I have subsequently turned the air-flow meter three clicks
following Dan's advice. Mileage has improved considerably, the plugs are
greyish tan color (as opposed to black)  and the tailpipe no longer spews
out soot at idle. It has been a while since the van has  shown more than 200
miles before going empty.

My questions are:

a) given that, next to the ECU, the airflow meter is the most costly
electronic  item to replace in the engine compartment doesn't it make sense
to develop some kind of air flow faq or &quot;how to&quot;  info package on the air
flow meter?  For example, can anyone explain how they work; how they can be
adjusted; if they should be adjusted and what the consequences are?  My
airflow meter has some 170,000 miles on it so it would come as no big
surprise that the spring would need tightening. Is there any down side to
this? I have used a simple way of checking: tighten the dial and then check
the color of the plugs plus listen to the idle.

b) how does an airflow meter work in conjunction with the injectors and O2
sensor? Is fuel constant with the  air flow being varied? Why does the idle
mixture  screw have a  minimal impact - does it work at idle only?

c) Is there  a way of testing meter effectiveness? In other words are all of
them adjusted to certain factory specs and then installed and if so what
arethos specs? ie certain output at certain loads.


Thanks greatly for setting me straight.
