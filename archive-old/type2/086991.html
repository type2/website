&gt; The manual transmission will be lubricated as the gears inside turn through

&gt; transmission wouldn't be properly lubricated rolling along in neutral with
&gt; the engine off.

right the manual transmission has a &quot;splash&quot; lubrication system.  the
gears run through the oil and &quot;splash&quot; enough of it around to lub the
tranny
while
the auto tranny has a presure lube system much like an engine, the lube
pump, pumps tranny fluid through the gears and other critical parts.
