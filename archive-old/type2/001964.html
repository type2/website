&gt; Tim,
&gt; You didn't mention, after 4 months and 14,000 miles in a 
&gt; splittie, did your
&gt; relationship with Heather hold up as well as your bus?
&gt; 

I'm not going to saw it went perfect..... but it went surprisingly well
got along great most of the time... odd having only one other
person to talk with for the better part of 4 months....

Tim
