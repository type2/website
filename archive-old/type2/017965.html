&gt; My 58 single cab has a 15 gallon tank from a 68-71 bus.  Fits in there just
&gt; fine with plenty of room on all sides to spare.  You have to get/fabricate
&gt; some longer tie-down straps.

Did you have any problems with the float or gauge? Or am I delusion
thinking that anybody's gas gauge actually works?
