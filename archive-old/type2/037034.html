Subject: Shining up those jalousies

&gt;From time to time someone asks how to shine the aluminum frames on 
jalousie windows. I don't recall ever seeing the right answer. Since I'm 
doing mine (half-hearted style, for the moment), so I'll give y'all the 
skinny.

Forget about chemicals. What you need is sandpaper. Wet or dry, used dry. 
Start with 220 to get rid of white rust. This goes very quickly; three to 
five passes should do it. Then switch to 320. A little more elbow grease, 
this time. You're done with 320 when the pits are all gone and the frame 
is smooth. And you'll be tempted to quit there, the frame will look so good!

But wait. There's more.

Go over the whole thing again with 400. And then with a polishing wheel 
on a Dremel tool and rouge (don't bother with that dinky container of 
Dremel rouge. Sear's has a nice big bar for about $2.00). When you've 
cleaned that off, your frame will shine like new chrome, but not as garish.

The whole-hearted method is to take the frame out of the bus, remove the 
rubber, the rivets, and the glass. Do everything, then reassemble with 
new rivets rubbed in beeswax. Lightly grease all the other moving contacts.
