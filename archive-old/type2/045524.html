Subject: [T2] Fuel pressure test port

&gt;p.s. Steve D., yeah, I could've used a tire schraeder valve, but I'm a
&gt;little paranoid that it would leak after a while.  I've had a spraying
&gt;fuel hose before.. :)

Though Porsche use tirevalve-like thingies. They are usually placed 
on the end of a fuel rail, and covered with a nut, Porsche test gauges 
fit straight onto them. The valves used might have special 
fuel resistant seals. I've never used it, only assisted a collegue who 
was hooking up the test gauges, thought I'd share what I saw :-)
