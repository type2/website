Subject: speaking of heaters...

i hooked my heater box cables back up yesterday - wife was riding in 
the bus for the first time since it got 'cold' here in phoenix. we 
were tooling along at about 60 when she mentioned a draft; i said 'no 
prob, i'll turn on the heat' and threw down the dash levers.
a HUGE geyser of red desert sand erupted from each windshield vent, 
bounced off the glass and curled over our heads into the cab.  we sat 
a moment in stunned silence and then laughed and coughed the next few 
miles.  i'm not sure where the dirt got in, but it was obviously from 
my trip home from jerome last fall (i skipped the highways and went 
over the mountains and thruough the desert).

needless to say, the idea of a BN4 or 6 is looking better to her.
