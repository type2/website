Subject: Need 1600 thermostat flaps Help please!

Hello,
I am rebuilding a couple of old core motors i have been saving.......one to
make a Volks air and the other for an old 73 i have.  Both of the fan
shrouds on these have had the thermostat flaps removed.  If anyone has a set
of flaps including the long flat actuating lever that clips to the backside
of them..pmail vgonman_at_msn_dot_com with a price.......

I might could trade something type4 motor related for these pieces..........
