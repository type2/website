&gt;Hello All    When I was in Yellowstone I found it better to camp off the fire

&gt;national parks made camping outside the park and going back and forth cheaper

I forgot one thing, which I was alerted to by Eddie Hintz's journal from
his trip to Inuvik. There are several free (and very underpublicized)
campsites just north of the Flagg Ranch (which is between Yellowstone and
GTNP). Take the turnoff to Flagg Ranch and immediately bear to the right.
Follow this road as it crosses the Snake River (look for eagles as you
cross the river), then continue on the dirt road. There are several free
campsites scattered on the road, with toilets and running water!

As Steve Dolan mentioned, the NFS campgrounds located just outside the
national parks are also a great option. If you're going to camp in
Yellowstone as of mid-June to the end of August, it's best to make
reservations through AMFAC if you don't want to have to drive all over the
place in a futile search for camping space. The Yellowstone campgrounds are
of two types: one is administered by AMFAC (Madison, Canyon, Bridge Bay,
Fishing Bridge, Grant, for example), and you can get reservations for them,
and are more expensive; the other is adminintered by the NPS, and are
available on a first-come, first served basis. In the busy season, they're
usually full by mid-morning or noon.
