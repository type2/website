Subject: Re: [T2] major engine teardown woes

&gt;a) one of the heads has hairline cracks

&gt;d) one of the cylinders fins missing
&gt;  Unfortunately, I'm on a budget with this
&gt;engine for the time being. Here are my questions....


At this point, I must point out, you cannot have a known budget before 
teardown, unless it allows for everything you might find to factually be 
spec or not. You will be money ahead to get a reputable remanufactured long 
block. With the kind of damage you describe, you can't assume the rods and 
bottom end will be ok, you must do the teardown and measure, or risk every 
cent of a compromise &quot;used but good and cheap&quot; parts assembly. Do you want 
to get it running another month or 3, then do it all again. Work out the 
budget numbers on that one and compare to the cost of doing it right now 
once and for all and the future health of your budget will improve.
