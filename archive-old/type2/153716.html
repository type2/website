Subject: Re: [T2] 2-Armed Engine Bench Stand?

&gt; &quot;it's just the cheapest version you can buy and while I might mount the
yoke
&gt; by itself to a sturdy bench I wouldn't trust the welding at those prices.&quot;
&gt; So does anyone have any experience with the bench-mounted 2 armed yoke?

Looks like no-ones replied so I'll stick in my 2cents. 'Sides I have three
engine stands.
The bench mount stand is good for assembling the crank and the bottom end, I
wouldn't hang anything heavier than a short block type one from it. To make
one from a rolling stand isn't that expensive or hard-Harbor frt and others
sell cheap 1ton stands and to modify a bellhouseing only requires drilling
one hole, plus now you can mount a starter and run your new motor.

If none of this works, you could use the cheap one to assemble the bottom
end and then move it to the bench to install the p/c's and rest.

my 2c's
