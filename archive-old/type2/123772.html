Subject: Warning buzzer for lights

Hi there,

You all recently helped me out by directing me to the right connection for a
wire that had come loose. Thanks for that, you people are so kind. I4ve been
reading this list for quite a while now, rather passively and learning a
lot. I always enjoy the friendliness most of you expose. Similar lists are
not always like that. For that, you4re all welcome for a drink at our place
I live in Belgium though ;-).
Now it4s time for another question: I just bought a buzzer supposed to
prevent me leaving the lights of the bus on when parked, as not to drain the
battery. But how do I have to connect this little thing to work right? It
seems to me it has to work when the contact of the car is switched off and
the lights are on. How do you manage this?

Thanks again for your advice.

Bart
