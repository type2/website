Subject: RE: [T2] Pop top order fiasco

&gt;  I just wanted to make sure that I was clear to the list members
&gt; in the fact that I am usually very happy with the Bus Depot's service ...
&gt; As I said in that post, I am disappointed in the way &quot;THIS&quot; transaction
was
&gt; handled.  For the record, I have been quite satisfied in the overall
quality
&gt; of service from the Bus Depot.


Your clarification is greatly appreciated. A little bit of negative press
can do a lot of harm to a small business, even if not intended that way.  I
could ship 1000 orders perfectly, but if customer number 1001 has a gripe
and airs it on the net,  his comment has more effect on my business than the
1000 well-handled orders that preceded it.  Such is the power of the
internet.

I'll follow up with the factory tomorrow and make sure they shipped that
canvas out to you as promised.
