Subject: Re: [T2] Cheap Bosch Points, any thoughts????

Hello Courtney and the list,

That is what I was thinking of doing. If more people
sound interested, I will buy them and do just that.
$1.00 a set is not a bad price considering they are
currently selling for $2.50 a piece. I will see how it
goes. Thanks for the interest!

Have a great day!

Regards,
David Kelly

&gt; Think about it, have you gotten ANY points lately

&gt; Brazil or Mexico or India or Taiwan?? I don't think
&gt; I've seen any german
&gt; points or plugs for about 5 yrs up here in Canaduh.
&gt; At that price, you
&gt; cannot lose. Not to mention you can offer them to
&gt; others at 1 dollar a set
&gt; and make some money to cover your costs. If they'll
&gt; fit my 009 dizzy, I&quot;ll
&gt; buy a dozen off you right now!!
