That may or may not have been my post. Either way, here’s the procedure 
for fixing/replacing front scrapers.

1. Remove inside-the-door hardware. Single phillips screw in the window 
crank, under the cover; handle is straightforward; latch requires popping 
out center plastic and removing phillips screw (don’t know about early 
baywindows).

2. Carefully pry the trim board away from the door. Remove vapor barrier 
plastic if your door has it (or peel back).

3. Remove two bolts that hold window to mechanism. Lift up over mechanism 
and then lower down to door bottom.

4. Remove bolt holding lower end of channel between window and vent. Pry 
out and remove felt channel all around. Front channel also has a phillips 
screw securing it to top of window opening. Remove this. Pull channel 
toward rear and angle down. Wiggle as needed. Pull the channel and vent 
window out completely.

5. There are five clips that hold the felt channel top and rear. Remove 
these. As long as you can see them, how to remove them is obvious.

6. Now carefully pry the scraper and molding away from the door at the 
bottom opening.

7. Gently pull the rest of the molding out, taking care to be gentle at 
the ends.

8. The molding is so flimsy that it will distort of its on weight. Don’t 
worry about this too much. If you don’t crease or dent it, it will find 
its original shape when you put it back it (if just replacing scraper). 
Of course, if you bought scraper with molding, be as destructive as you 
care to be.

9. Replacement is reverse of removal, but note: The molding can and 
probably will scratch paint unless you tape some paper all the way 
around, removing it when you are done.

10. As for how to get the rubber to actually make contact with the 
window, I have no idea.
