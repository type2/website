True, a lot of teenagers don't respect the antique car hobby, but a number 
of them do. I'm 19 now and was raised to love and respect the community of 
antique and classic cars. I know how much work and money they involve but am 
willing to dedicate myself to it because of the values my father and his car 
buddies installed in me a long time ago.Sure there are a lot of kids who 
don't realize the way buses work, so just be careful when selling your buses 
to teenagers.I was 17 when I bought my bus. I couldn't drive stick and had 
never even been inside a bus. Older and more experienced people like my dad 
have helped me to understand my bus.I can drive it now,I can do a lot of 
work on it w/ my dad and I know how it works.I realize it will cost a whole 
lot more than the $900 dollars I paid for it, but I'm willing to work 
hard.Remember- we're the generation that will keep the buses and other 
antique cars alive in the future.
