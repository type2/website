Subject: Re: [T2] fuel/vent line question

Mike...are you sure the end with the two nipples (one small, one big) 
is the end hooked to the shroud?  On my 73, it's the opposite.  Now, I'm 
wondering.  However, if mine was flip-flopped, it would not fit with 
the original factory configuration of the vent lines.  i.e. the shround 
HAS to connect to the side of the canister with the single large nipple.  
Anyone else?

I'm not that familiar with late Bays, but the principles herein should 
apply..........


**Check the canister out by removing it and blowing through it. Blow through 
the end with two outlets (one larger - one smaller), and cover the smaller 
outlet and blow through the larger. 

**The larger outlet you blew through is connected to your fan shroud. The 
smaller outlet is connected to your gas tank. And the outlet on the other side 
runs to your air filter.
