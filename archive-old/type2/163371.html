Subject: Re: [T2] real deal german heads

Steve -

LMB was an original manufacturer &quot;back in the day&quot;.  This and other German
OE manufacturers have long since disappeared over the years being swallowed
up in the ever consuming consolidation of European manufacturers that have
of course moved tooling and manufacturing to the four corners of the world
these days.  But ya never know, you might have found a &quot;treasure trove&quot; of
NOS pieces.

Suspicion should always be raised and acted upon accordingly, no matter how
&quot;good to be true&quot; something (or some things) may be.

I've never seen OE German heads come enveloped in cosmoline, at least when
I've remembered that far back (70s).  When my father and I purchased new OE
German bare 1600 dual port heads in 1977 from the dealer, they weren't
coated in cosmoline either.  Cranks, flywheels, camshafts, etc., yes, plenty
of cosmoline on those :-)

&gt; someone is selling type 1 single port cylinder heads that are stamped
&gt; &quot;Lmb germany&quot;. does this necessarily mean they were made in germany?
&gt; they have no cosmoline, and come as a 10 pack in a wooden crate.
&gt; should i be suspicious that they are not actually made in germany?  -
