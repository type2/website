Subject: Re: [T2] Ignition switch problems :-(

First things to check: is the battery charged? Did you make good 
connections when you installed it? Did you knock any wires loose when 
installing the battery?

Neither the stereo connection nor the ignition switch are likely to be 
at fault in this case.
