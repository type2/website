Subject: Exhaust leaks

Hello everyone,

I'm a new subscriber and I really enjoy all the informative
conversation.  Getting to the point,  I have a 1970 campmobile with a
stock single port 1600.  The most recent rebuild was done less than 1000
miles ago.  I am certain that valves timing etc. are to spec. The bus
seems to backfire when I down shift pretty.   Is this something to worry
about.  My throttle positioner is adjusted properly.  Also, my exhaust
is german and fairly new.  There are no obvious leaks in the system. 
Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  I am also curious if the
is a way to adjust carburation without expensive exhaust gas analyzers.
