&gt;You should see two bolt heads that take a 10mm wrench.  Remove 
&gt;these bolts and, if the drumsare not rusted on, the drums should 
&gt;come right off.  If the drums are rusted on, you've got a bit more work


Not trying to pick nits, just an 'FYI':  Those bolts are likely to be
11mm if they haven't been replaced.  Or maybe that's if they have been
replaced?  All I know is my bus and several others I've worked on used
11mm to hold the drums on.  Oh, and don't over-torque them!
