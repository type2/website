&gt; Tom said:
&gt;
&gt; &gt;idle mixture control.  And no, the AFM flap/resistance circuit is *not*
&gt; &gt;uninvolved when the engine is idling.  The minute you start the engine
&gt; &gt;the air vane moves from its &quot;resting&quot; position to a position
&gt; &gt;corresponding to the the engine's air demand, be this &quot;idle&quot;
&gt; &gt;or &quot;wide open throttle.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;Well although this is correct for the idling discussion involved it
&gt;should be noted the WOT statement is not correct for L-jet's
&gt;with a WOT switch which as we all know includes variably 2L
&gt;buses and most Vanagons.  In those systems WOT mixture is
&gt;a preset item totally independent of the AFM.

Well, since I said the *air vane* moves according to engine demand,
including WOT, I can't see how the statement can be declared &quot;incorrect.&quot;
Are you saying that when the throttle is fully open the air vane *doesn't*
move from its position of &quot;something less than wide open throttle?&quot;

&gt;And to tell the truth I'm not sure how much idle mixture is
&gt;involved in the AFM either, I've never tinkered with that
&gt;end of the spectrum but it seems to me that I recall reading
&gt;idle mixture is a preset as well, perhaps RPM based as VW
&gt;L-jet never had an idle switch.

Read any of the manuals concerning these systems and they all specify the
procedure for adjusting idle mixture, and the correct parameters.  The idle
mixture was &quot;factory set&quot; in that the adjustment screw was hidden by a
tamper-proof plug, undoubtedly designed to keep shade-tree hammer mechanics
from fiddling with something they knew nothing about.  Having adjusted the
idle mixture with the top of the AFM off I know that the air van moves in
response to these adjustments.

&gt;As to the whole resetting your AFM anyway my only
&gt;advice is be careful and don't make rash adjustments,
&gt;shouldn't take more than a few clicks to restore it to
&gt;stock operation which is too lean anyway

Why do you say that?  The whole system is trying to keep the air/fuel ratio
right at the point that *all* the fuel delivered can be burned in the
available air.
