&gt; You or I or Thom would supply pictures, natch, but the state... well...

Just a note of caution, these guys are getting much more knowledgable
about what is what and what's s'posed to be there.  My XSO just spent
a considerable amount of time and cash dealing with smogging her car
because she had a later exhaust on it (with a cat even) that they
said was illegal.  They then proceeded to go up the car's butt with
a microscope (so tto speak) to check every single hose and valve on
it.  This was the smog ref.  It was an independent smog shop that
saw the incorrect exhaust and sent her down that slippery slope.

What was scary, was that the told me afterwards: &quot;It would have been
simpler just to buy a new car!&quot;
