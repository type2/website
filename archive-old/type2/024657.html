Subject: changing plugs
Message-ID: &lt;88e7f8e6.244a5b78_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

	Hypothetically speaking, say you are changing your spark plugs for 
the first time, on your '76 bus.  You read up in all the manuals, check the 
web site and get the procedure straight.  You work carefully, doing the three 
easy ones before moving on to the dreaded no. 2 cylinder.  As you are trying 
to put the new plug in, the plug and the socket it is in fall of your wrench 
and go deep inside the engine tin.  If you stand in just a certain way, and 
twist your arm around in a really uncomfortable position and jam your finger 
in there and twist it in ways it's not supposed to twist you can just barely 
feel the end of the plug in there.  So, how would you possibly ever get it 
out?  The only solutions I see are a) turn the bus upside down and shake real 
hard, or b) pretend it didn't happen, get a new plug and a new socket and try 
again.   Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
