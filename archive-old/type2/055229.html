&gt; I just made some measurements on my recent 1980

mine is a 2L rebuild in a 1978 with auto tranny and hyd lifters and the
a new melling stock size oil pump, (machined into spec)

&gt; reasonable hot idle oil pressures must be extremely
&gt; rare.  Here's what I found out:

shouldn't think so.

&gt; 1. Hot idle is 10 psi with AC off, and 7 psi when AC

hot idle, 35-45psi, no AC

&gt; on (Ac just lowers idle speed).  It takes 15 to 30
&gt; minutes running at 55 mph to see these low pressures. 

I can drive all day at 60 and not see lower than 30

&gt; When first started cold the pressure is 70 psi.  I

that seems slightly high, I thought the presure relief valve opened around
60psi or so. in any case I might see 70 at start up but usually holds
between 45-55 driving,

&gt; 2. At 55 mph I usually get 36 psi, which isn't too

at 55 mine never drops below 45 usually closer to 55

&gt; The engine's still under warranty, but I don't want to
&gt; be unreasonable.  I can't find any rebuilders who'll
&gt; promise higher oil pressures and compression.  GEX
&gt; said they would quote a figure when they received

GEX will promise you anything but don't count on geting any of it.

&gt; he closed shop.  What other good rebuilders are ther
&gt; other than GEX, Boston Engines, and maybe Mofoco?

&quot;GOOD&quot;???  not GEX, have no experience with the others.

&gt; Also, it could be my rebuild (done by a mechanic with
&gt; over 20 years experience) was done for longevity
&gt; rather than performance.  What do you guys think? 

what did you ask him for?
oil presure has nothing to do with compression

&gt; Does it make much difference if you only have 7 to 10
&gt; psi at hot idle with a new rebuild?  I've heard

it would make me nervous

&gt; stories of owners driving for many tens of thousands
&gt; of miles with the oil light flickering at hot idle. 

but NOT a new rebuild

&gt; Should I just chuck that VDO and keep truckin?  Am I
&gt; losing much performance or gas mileage at 100 vrs 135
&gt; psi compression?

your call, I would keep the guage and figure out what the problem was
