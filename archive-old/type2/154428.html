Subject: Help w/ wiring issue

All,
I am new to all this so if I am not following protocol I apologize in
advance.
I recently bought a non working '78 FI bus w/ automatic transmission.  I am
attempting to reinstall the engine after dropping it to get to the gas tank.
From everything I've read I've got a short in the electrical system, but I
can't figure out where.  Per the archive and Muir I started pulling the fuses
one at a time and grounding the ground strap but I got sparks each time, even
with all of the fuses out.  I even pulled one fuse that is down and to the
left of the fusebox (I'm not sure if this was a PO installation or not) and I
have no fuse in the in-line holder in the engine compartment.  I have no clue
where to start looking now.  Do I need to have all the wiring attached to the
coil to test this properly?  I'm sure this is probably not enough info. but
being new to all of this it's all I know.  If it matters I originally hooked
up the coil backwards so I'm not sure if I've fried something or not.  At the
moment I have everything to the coil unhooked.
If someone could point me in the right direction I would appreciate it.  I am
close to towing it in and letting the professionals handle it, but I hate to
quit this far into the game... :)
Also, if someone could let me know what size fuse goes into the in-line holder
(to the backup lights I think) that would be helpful.  I have viewed the
wiring diagram but it's all gibberish to me.

THANK YOU!
