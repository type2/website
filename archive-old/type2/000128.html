Subject: Re: Mojave phone booth -- how to drive on loose sand?

Iffen your not sure, get out and walk it. You'd be surprized what you can't 
see from the drivers seat. Most important in loose sand is to keep the speed 
up, don't try to make any sudden turns and forget about your brakes.Develop a 
thousand yard stare so's you know whats ahead of you, most people look right 
ahead and have no time for corrections.Personally I drive like hell so I can 
float on top of the sand and have plenty of gears to downshift with. The 
previous info brought to you courtesy of a youth wasted desert racing and 
ghost town hunting. YMMV not to mention a lot of time spent in the air 
thinking, 'boy is this gonna hurt'
