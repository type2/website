Subject: Re: [T2] 76 Westy starts and dies

&gt; Yup.  The price of admission, tho is ~$150.  About the cost of a tune up.
..
&gt; A dwell meter.  You really cannot live without one.  Someone (Barry?)
&gt; recently found a discontinued SunPro modle on sale, discontinued, for &lt;
&gt;
&gt; Timing light, buy a $50 basic one without the digital advance crap.  Nice,
&gt; but you don't need it.
&gt;
&gt; Vacuum gauge.  Should be about $20.  If you want to combind purchases, buy
&gt; a Mity-Vac.  You can use the gauge on that as a vacuum gauge.
&gt;
&gt; If you have $60 more, buy an FI fuel pressure gauge.
&gt;

Hit the sunpro garage sale
Vacuum/Pressure Tester - CP7803    30.00
Digital Engine Multimeter - CP7676GS    15.00

Inductive Timing Light - CP7504   40.00 (not on sale)

This gets you there for 85 plus shipping.

*	We like to enjoy the good things in life.
*	We are in favor of activities which don't cost much.
*	We prefer to camp outside of campings,even if it's not too legal.
*	We don't bother much about keeping our West's as neet or closer as
        possible to the original look of a Westfalias, we prefer the
        utility and the personnality of the vehicule.
*	We try to repair ourselves our Wests.
