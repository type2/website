No this is the standard black square weave for the 75 bucket seats in a
passenger bus.

My post script was referring to the fact that I failed to replace the oil pump
when I rebuilt the engine about 200 miles ago. Not a good thing! Oil pressure
was way low cause the pump was worn out. Left the engine in, pulled the bumper,
3 pieces of rear tin, alternator, fan and housing to R&amp;R the oil pump. Used a
Max1 pump from CB Performance. Had to machine the input shaft of the pump but
it worked great! I had asked the list about the feasibility of changing the
pump without removing the engine and only got one reply. Just thought I'd
publish the fact that this task is possible with the engine in the bus even
though Bentley says you have to pull the engine. Hope it saves someone some
time.
