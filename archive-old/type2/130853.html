&gt; OK I just got a 78 FI standard 2 L engine and want to put it in my 73.
Nice score.

&gt; It looks like everything came with the engine except the brain for the 
&gt; FI that is attached to engine.
&gt; What else might I need.

Are the double relay and vacuum canister there? Those are usually 
attached to the firewall, and might not have been removed.

You will need to swap the flywheel over from the 73 engine if you plan 
to use the same tranny.

&gt; I already have a late model tank so have the in and out tubes.
&gt; What else????

The throttle cable for the 75-79 bay is shorter than the 73 cable.
You will have to cobble up a support for the airbox.

&gt; Where have other people mounted the brain?

Why not just dremel a hole for it in the stock location?

Let me know how you make out with this, my next project is to put FI on 
the Westfakia. It has to be completed before June 10th so I can go to 
BusFusion.

Happy trails,
