Subject: long block or engine rebuild kit?

--part1_22.2492e049.29b42af4_boundary

I was just wondering if anyone could answer a few questions for me, as it 
would be a great help.  First, I have a 1969 bus from Texas with a good body. 
I got three engines with it, all 1600cc and all pre 1970 single port. I have 
all the pieces to convert one of the engines to dual port. I have everything 
with all of these engines to put one together and probably get it running. 
But, I would like this engine to be dependable and might want to go with 
newer internal components. I have a degree in automotive, and have taken down 
a VW engine before, but never put one back together, though I've done quite a 
few 350s in my day.  My questions are this;
 1. Would I be better off  just buying a long block or is a kit the way to 
go, and who would be a good vendor for such a purchase?  I have seen some 
things from GEX but I really have no experience with the quality.
 2. Would like to go with a more powerful, but still dependable 1641cc . Do I 
need to do any modifications to a 1969 motor for that, other than pistons and 
cylinders?
 3. Could individual components be better tan buying a kit?
I would appreciate anyones help on this subject. thanks
                                           BUS GYPSY69
