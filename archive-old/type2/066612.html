Subject: Staying warm

Well the main subject as of late is staying warm and heaters. Well, the cheapest
way is just wrap yourself in blankets and a stocking cap and just go. You make 
look like a indian chief but what is wrong with that. If anyone has a decent 
working heating system and plans to install (aka converting it all to work) on 
the web I would appericiate the address. I am running out of blankets when I 
cruise up to Iowa.
