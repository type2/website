Subject: Can I get a diagnosis, please?

Hi all:

I know how difficult these &quot;over the internet&quot; diagnosis can be, but here 
goes...

Jump in '81 Vanagon this morning, car starts up with first crank, running 
fine.  Start the drive over to my mom's house, the car's running strong, 
go about 2 miles when all of a sudden the engine just stops like the 
ignition's been turned off: all the red lights come on, no expensive 
grinding noises, etc.

Drift over to the side of the road and attempt to restart; sounds like 
the starter's jammed, i.e., hear it try to turn over, but it's not able 
to turn.

As far as I know the battery is OK (maybe 9 months old) and the 
alternator's OK (probably 2 years on rebuild).  It's sitting in the 
driveway right now (thanks AAA) and I'm going to dive in there shortly, 
but if anybody has any ideas I'd appreciate hearing about them.

TIA.
