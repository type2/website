Help. Have owned this 76 Westy for about 8 years. Beautiful. Looks like new from about 10 feet. Original bus inside, too. Have put on only about 6000 miles. It seems like I have paid more for professional help to make the engine run than I have on gasoline for it. Have picked up a new double relay and air intake sensor along the way. I like to think I am not a complete dummy. I have no trouble making my 1970 beetle start and run. Nor my 1967 Camaro nor my 1970 Toronado. 

The Westy is different. It was professionally tuned about 300 miles ago when it would start and die. Just like now. Nothing wrong with the FI they said. The engine mechanicals were checked at the same time and all pronounced good. Original engine with good compression.  

Now it will start like normal, run for a couple of seconds and die. If you open the throttle completely as you start it, you can get it to pop and crackle and stay alive. As soon as you get the throttle close to idle, it dies.

I have looked at the Bosch L-Jetronic Workshop Manual (and the Green Book) and done what I can with the trouble shooting guide. I don't have a fuel pressure gauge. In the greasy knuckle department I have: 1) gotten big fat sparks out of the ignition. 2) changed the fuel filter. Gas gushed from the engine side. Maybe a half gallon before I got it stopped. Didn't expect that. 3) checked and corrected poor vacuum connections. They now seem pretty good, but I did not replace all the hoses. Won't swear I have perfect vacuum, but nothing I did changed the symptoms. 4) tested the air intake sensor. Resistance between terminals 36 and 39 works as it should.

Any suggestions?
