Subject: Need help finding used VW Pick up parts

Hey look, it's Mr. Question Dude!

I am in DESPERATE need of a VW truck DONOR vehicle for my crew cab.  
Actually, all I need is a couple of pieces of the rear pick up bed floor. Can 
anyone assist me with this? Are they available new from any source?

Here's another one for you.  What is the purpose of the two holes in the 
floor right under my gas pedal (71 model)?  They are near the top edge of the 
pedal when it is pressed to the floor.  Can anyone clue me in?

Thanks,

Dave
