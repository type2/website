FWIW sometimes a bad insurance company experience is the agent's fault and not representative of the company as a whole. 

Had Nationwide for a decade and then relocated to another town. My parents continue to have Nationwide insurance with good results. Chattanooga agent tells me to let my insurance run out and open a new account here in my new home. Not good advice! 

Anyhow the morning after my insurance expired (midnight before), went to local agent for Nationwide to open a new policy. They told me (remember I was a customer for a decade) that because I let my insurance expire, they would have to write me as a HIGH-RISK driver. No accidents, no tickets, no claims in years... Like 10 years... 

I got mad, red in the face, told them that was stupid and insane and left. My wife's family had been with State Farm for decades - with an 'S'. We went into a local S-F office, explained our needs, reminded them of a long history with State Farm, got a bunch of discounts for having house and car and being married and being accident/ticket/claim free. Still with them and find their prices reasonable and the agent's service WONDERFUL. Maybe it's nice women in a small town - I don't know, but I'm happy. 

If you get frustrated, call the company's customer service number or find another agent. I was lucky to have an A+ agent in Chattanooga with Nationwide and an A+ agent here in Cookeville with S-F.
