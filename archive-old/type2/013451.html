&gt;Ok, what's the deal? Everywhere I look I see 009's for sale claiming 
&gt;improved performance and all I'm hearing on this list is &quot;get rid of your 
&gt;009 and get a stock dizzy.&quot; &gt;Dean
&gt;Confused in Augusta


Dean:

I've never owned a VW other than a bus, but what I've heard is that the 009 is good for bugs, ghias, etc.  The reason they're not good for busses is that the bus, being a much larger and heavier vehicle than other AC VW's, needs a different advance curve than the 009 has.  Part of the problem is the 009 doesn't have an adjustable advance curve, or else we'd all probably be singing it's praises.  If you can't find a stock vacuum-advance dizzy, Mallory makes an outstanding VW dizzy that has something like 27 different advance curves you can set just by changing the springs.  I just bought one, but haven't installed it yet, so unfortunately, I can't give a first-hand account on it's performance.
