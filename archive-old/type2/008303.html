Hi everybody !!

This is my 2nd post.  My name is Pedro P.Vivas (but you can call me
autopedro)  and I'm writing from Caracas - Venezuela.

I subscribe because I wanted to know more about what is people talking out
there about the grat Type2's.  I recently purchase a 1973 transporter with
a 1700cc  engine and is running perfectly well, only the complete
upholstery has to be done , from the roof to the carpet, from the front
seats to the rear ones, and because this is my only vehicle, my wife
started to hate me because of how the van is (is not very confortable for
an everyday driving)

Another thing is, that here in Venezuela you can find normal spares lyke
body, drive train, suspension, stearing, but nothing about the engine and
this freeks me up.  I have to start asking things from the US market before
I start having problems with the engine which I'm not having yet (thanks
god).
 
Tomorrow Feb 13/99 at 03:00 Hrs. I'm headding for an 800 Km trip (this is
from Caracas to Maracaibo) and I hope the van behaves well.

Thanks for the attention and have a good weekend to all.

Yours,
Pedro Vivas
