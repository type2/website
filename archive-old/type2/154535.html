&gt; Not available much of anywhere!  I know some folks have found them, but we 
&gt; couldn't even find one at the Disney store.  None of the Jeeps either.

Disney is putting out a line of slightly-larger-than-Matchbox cars from the 
movie.  I saw them in Wally Mart a few weeks ago.  Cost $3.17 US each.

Filmore the splittie is one of the ones available.  I saw three at the store 
that night, bought two.  One for myself and one to eBarf, sell or something. 
If they're not showing up at other Wally Marts, maybe I should go back and 
buy up the few that were left?

I also saw a line of PEZ dispensers from the movie, but alas, no Filmore...
