&gt; just a quick question. the po or the po's po took off the regular wheels on
&gt; my 72 westy and put on alloys. my question is how can i check to see if my
&gt; speedo cable is still attached to the wheel without taking the wheel off (if
&gt; i can at all).

If it's a typical alloy wheel with a center cover, the cover is inserted
from the back side of the wheel.  You'll have to remove the wheel to check
the speedo cable.
