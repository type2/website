Subject: Re:  [T2] engine out, anything else to replace

Shifter linkage bushings!! The ones inside the tube. You have to pull
out the shifter rod to the rear - so you have to have your tranny out to
do it. They are only a few bucks from bus depot. Treat yourself with
easy-to-find gears ...

At the same time replace the front bushing (two different styles
depending on year) and get a quick shift kit.
