Subject: drippy  tubes

I,d appreciate any help on offer concerning a problem with my 1980 2000cc type2  twin solex pdsit32 34 carbs. 
I bought the van new in May 1980, and have 150 000miles clocked. The problem occurs a couple of minutes after ignition switch-off when both injector tubes start dripping petrol and continue to do so for  several minutes.This floods the manifolds and makes for hard starting when she then belches black smoke. The van goes really well when driving and  cold starts no problem. I have tried an alterative pair of similar carbs, but the problem remains. Many thanks in advance. My prayers and sympathy to all the victims of the terrible attack last tuesday. JOE&gt;
