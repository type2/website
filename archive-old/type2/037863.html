Subject: GL-4/5 and other trans related oil questions

In the last few weeks the subject of trans lube has come up. As I remember an oil rated as gl-4 is what we want right? 
I have seen additives like Prolong, slick 50, Duralube, etc, they make stuff for manual trans. Has anyone used this stuff and will it hurt or help a VW transaxle? I have used the engine treatment(Duralube)on a Non-VW and saw a marked improvment in smoothness and very slight increase in MPG and power.
  I guess my main question is will it hurt my trans or not. I know there are 100 different opinion on if it works or not, please save them. Just tell me if I will hurt anything.
