sounds like at least that head has to come off, I would guess that a
connecting rod let go somehow?!?!

&gt; This engine is a GEX rebuild that I put into the car 28,000 miles and two 

sounds like you have been GEXed.  when you tear it down, check to see if
the pistons match.   

&gt; I'll start putting one of my rebuilds in the car tomorrow, and try and 
&gt; determine what the problem is with my GEX rebuild sometime later.

the problem is the GEX.  chalk it up to experience, fighting with Otis
isn't worth the time and ulcer.
