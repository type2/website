&gt;The part I'm referring to looks like a clip that fits on the rear (RIR) of

&gt;horizontal part going between the pads, presumably to hold them steady and 
&gt;keep them, from rattling.

&gt;Bentley calls them &quot;rattle clips,&quot; but I don;t know if that's what they're 
&gt;listed as...

It's called the spreader spring and the ATE style is 211-615-269A on a 73-79 bus.

Pick up 4 new retaining pins for both sides (ATE style 211-615-261A) so the spring has a smooth surface to slide on.
