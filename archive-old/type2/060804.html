Subject: Parts Failure Survey and Speedo Question

Volks... it's Friday and I'm finally able to ask a survey type
question.  Yea!!

I am trying to identify the common failure items of VW vans.  Although I
own a '76 Westy, I am interested in all of the vans of the same body
style.  I won't call 'em breadloafs 'cause it tends to confuse the
newbies, of which I was one untill just recently.  

Example of the items that I have in mind are:

	1.  Front axle beam -The rust on mind killed Ralphy my 76 Westy.
	2.  Mirrors support bracket - Mine fell off at 65 mph
	3.  The sliding door latch.
	4.  Dirsctional signal switch.  The internal levers broke off on mine
leaving the thing latched permantly on.  When I ordered one from the
Recycled Bugs the counter guy said that the sell a lot of them but for
some reason sell very few wiper switches.  Whats worse is the
replacement did the same thing 2 weeks after installation.  I fixed it
with super-glue and it has worked good ever since.

&gt;From the above I can conclude that pot metal parts in my '76 tended to
crystalize easly.  I am anticipating a long trip with another '76 out in
the boonies and would like to have the known high failure parts on
hand.  Not that I would carry a spare mirror, but a good directional
switch would have been very handy when it broke, if you get the idea.

Obviously, ignition parts, clutch and accelerator cables are very useful
as would valve cover gaskets and seals for the push rod tubes.  But what
other parts have frequent failure on the VW bus? Does anybody have any
suggestions?

Next question: Could one of your guys who might have a beatle and a bus
speedometer kicking around check their outside diameter for me.  I am
thinking that one could use the combined gas gauge and speedo of the mid
70's beatle in the bus's dash, thus freeing up a gauge cluster hole.  In
my case I would fill that hole with 3 gauges vavagon style and fill that
space where the clock goes with another 3 gauges.  It would make a nice
stock looking custom dash.  Any thoughts?

For those of you who think that the lovely Bus Boys adapter kit for
mounting 3 VDO gauges in the dash under the AM/FM radio might be useful
to me, please be advised that that spot is already reserved for my
Alinco DR600T Dual Band Amateur Radio control head (its a two-way radio
on steroids for those of you aren't hams).  

Thanks for reading.
