Subject: door lock broken

Lately the pass. side door lock on my 68 single cab has been becoming harder 
to open.  Not consistent, but happens enough to be irritating, I didnt think 
it was going to unlock last time. I was hopeing someone could give me an idea 
of what it might be, and what parts I might need to fix it before I take it 
apart as I'm incredibly short on time, trying to repair our house, and would 
like to have everything I need to do the repair on hand. Also any tips on 
removing old, water damaged door pannels without completely trashing them 
would be appreciated.
thanks!
