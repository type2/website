Subject: Re: [T2] Steering Box Replacement

I wish I had a comprehensive procedure for this job. I'm breaking new ground
here. The tube in the frame item was advice from George Lyle. The one bolt
lines up, drill 2 holes came from Bus Boys. The fact that the later box is
much better is pretty much undisputed. A brand new box cost me $30 less than
a rebuilt worm and peg box, using rewelded and reground parts.
Whoever does it first, please let us know how it goes.
One thing I would like to know is will a ball joint pickle fork tool remove
the drag link from my Pitman arm without damaging the seal or joint? Or what
is the best tool or method for removing it?

step-by-step or comprehensive guide to this operation?  Thanks!
