Subject: Hagerty Insurance

Hi,

I have an agreed $12,000 policy through Hagerty for my 1977 Westy. They
did ask if it had a propane tank and I said no, the person was glad to
hear that because that was a no-no for them. Yeah typical classic car
restrictions like limited mileage and it has to be garaged oh and it
can't be a daily driver. I meet all they ask and sent photos no problem.
I have to say they where the only company who would give me an agreed
policy for my bus that I called anyway. I have been glad to have it even
if it is just for a piece of mind after the body restoration. Then I
will up the value a bit when the new engine goes in this spring. I
called Geico and they have nothing to offer you.

Meg
&lt;/pre&gt;
