&gt; Why, since bridgestone makes the RD603 in the correct size, did you go

&gt; opted for the common &quot;replacement&quot; suggestion.  Enquiring minds...

Because after having run the numbers so many times, the height difference
between a 'properly' sized 195/75R14 and a 185R14 was negligable enough,
to me, to justify the extra width.

BOY was I suprised to find out that the contact patch on the 603 is about
1 INCH narrower then the contact patch on the yoko 370!!!

I can only imagine how skinny that 185 would be.;)


I just cant stand skinny...:)
