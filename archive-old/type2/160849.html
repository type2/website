Subject: Brake squishyness

Hi,

A while back noticed I wasn't getting full return on my brake pedal.
Replaced the front rubber lines a few weeks back, helped greatly. Just
got done doing the rear rubber lines. They were all original
equipment, dated 1970. Well now the brakes pedal is acting strange.
I'm not getting full return, plus they feel soft. Brakes are working
great, stops on a dime, but the pedal just doesnt feel right. A few
questions:

1) How much brake fluid should I need to replace the fluid in the
entire braking system?

2) Can the rear brakes be correctly bled with the back end up on ramps?

3) Any thoughts on the lack of full return and squishness on the pedal.

I'm using Castrol Synthetic brake fluid (dot3/dot4 compatible) with a
500deg F dry boiling point.

Any thoughts appreciated.

peace
