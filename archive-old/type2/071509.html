Subject: '71 Bus hesitation
Message-ID: &lt;dfcc47c3.3675686a-100000_at_aol_dot_com&gt;


hello folks, 
A friend brought me his '71 bus to look at.  I'm more familiar with type 4
engines so I think I need some help.  
Upon acceleration, not consistently but about 50% of the time, there is
terrible hesitation to the point that the bus wants to die.  Stepping on the
clutch will bring it back to life.  It sputters through first gear and at
initial acceleration in second.  
Also, during deceleration, the engine has a tendency to stall.  
Rotor, points, condensor and dist. cap all are brand new.  Timing was just
adjusted this week.  Stock solex carb.
Can anyone help advise me where to begin?  Is the problem most likely in the
carburetor or is there a chance the fuel pump may be involved?  I'm new to
this type 1 engine.  
Thanks in advance,
Andy
