&gt; This is on my 78. http://calivw78_dot_com/wordpress/?p=30  My searching
&gt; has not provided any clue on the size of the rivet, or if this is a
&gt; rivet I can replace on my own.  Are these standard DIY store items or
&gt; am I stuck with what I have done already?

I used a recessed nut and bolt, trying to remember what they aare called
where the nut has a shaft and the bolt goes into it, has worked fine for
several years and allows you to swap out the guide without taking all
apart.

took the old rivet to the home center and found a matching set. in the
specialty bolts drawers
