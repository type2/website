Subject: [T2] 82 westy propane

Hi all,

     I am finally getting to play with my new westy.  I have a question.
When I turn on the propane on the outside I hear a hissing &amp; smell propane.
I am assuming that is bad &amp; shut it right off.  I have never had a westy
with propane so I wanted to make sure.
