Hello all,

The rust repair/primer application articles in the library don't quite seem
to apply to what I'm about to tackle and the manner in which I would like to
tackle it so I thought it might be ok to ask the list. I'm about to get my
bus back this weekend after about two months in the shop. I want to make up
for lost time and get right to work on a couple of cosmetic issues. The big
one is surface rust that is spread out pretty much the length of the roof.
Thankfully this is the only area where rust is doing its dirty work.
Unfortunately I don't have an ideal work space or any heavy duty rust or
paint equipment. I am just hoping that with a bit of muscle, perseverance,
some good music and cool refreshments that I can take care of this in one
weekend.  I am planning on dropping my bus off at a Maaco-type paint shop
later this summer but I'd like to do as much of the prep work on my end as
possible. My questions are:

1) What sandpaper type (number) should I use to get the rust down?
2) Can I get the rust down to where I need to with a hand (non-electric)
sanding block?
3) What would be a good primer/rust inhibitor to use on this area?
4) Would a primer/rust inhibitor from a spray can be a wise choice?

That's it, I guess. Basic questions, no doubt, but I just want to sort out a
few things before I proceed. Thanks in advance for any answers or tips!

Steve
