Subject: Octane switch / Aircooleds

I went from 87 to 89 octane and saw a definite drop in
CHT (Dakota Digital). Even in the 95F+ heat, driving
around town, my CHT stayed under 400F. Speeds up to
55 to 60mph got the temps up to about 415-420F, but
they quickly dropped back in the upper 300's once
I got to stop and go driving again.

I then switched from 89 octane to 93, but didnt notice
much of a temp change. I did notice my engine was harder
to start though.  I have vacuum leaks, most likely injector
seals. All my spark plug cones are white. As soon as I get
my other car up and running, I'll be replacing all my injectors
with rebuilts (w/new seals).

I assume from my observation that pre-ignition is more likely
with a lean mixture than rich, even though it may not be audible.
Why else would a higher octane make you run cooler?

Speaking of heat, I installed a new gauge in my bus this weekend.
An air temp gauge (Dakota). Where did I locate the sender?
I attached it to the plastic grill in front of the engine fan.
I wanted to see what the temp of the air was as it entered
the fan. So far, it has been in the upper 90's. When the bus
sits after running, the temp has been up to 160F. As soon as
I start the engine, it drops fairly quickly and at speed, drops
back to upper 90's. The temp does go up slightly (102F) at idle.
It will be interesting to watch the trends. This will also help
me know if my engine compartment is not sealed well. I plan on
doing some other tests, like leaving the heat exchanger tube
open, leaving the engine compartment door open, driving with
windows closed or open, and anything else I can think of.
