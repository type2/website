Subject: Re: [T2] Cops&amp; Bus's (Fri Topic)

OK Volks, It's friday so I'll share a few of my Cops&amp; Bus's tales.

While driving down a fair sized hill and seeing that I'll be having to go up 
another I'm gathering momentum, an old station wagon pulls out of a trailer 
park, even though there are double yellow lines I pass 'em! Unbeknowst to me 
there is a SC Hwy patrol behind me!  Yeah he's got ta pull me over...being 
raised in the south I say my &quot;yes sirs&quot; and &quot;no sirs&quot; and proceed to explain 
it's the nature of the beast.  He accepts gives a warning ticket.

Got the ole weaving pull over, I shows him the 180* play in the steering 
box, he laughs, no ticket!

Been pulled over and frisked cause I stopped at a closed gas station to get 
a soda from a vending machine, peered into the window to look at a picture 
of a huge tow truck. 1/4 mile from home two or three pull me over, one 
officer sees the machete in the back and says &quot;This is a concealed weapon&quot; I 
says &quot;This is a Camper, I do camp often&quot; OK the sarcasm creped into my voice 
a little, but the other officers let me go. Apparently the station had been 
robed.

Did get pulled over because of a bad tail light, me and my buddy ditch the 
roach, but we're questioned about the used syringe...needle broken off (been 
a diabetic since 13) Thumped the rear quarter panel the light comes back on 
and he let us go.

In 18yrs owning this bus I had never gotten a ticket other than warnings.

Until.....
One more,  On the way home from &quot;Hippie days&quot; last year, No tags,no 
Insurance, No Reg.. Yeah I was pushing it and did get $150 worth of tickets. 
Passing through Pisgah NF, park ranger pulled me because the &quot;Vintage&quot; 
dealer tag was only hanging on by one bolt, &quot;Janis Joplin&quot; is on the tape 
playing &quot;Lord it Just can't be&quot;.  Now the cool part.  The Ranger explains 
that he should have the vehicle impounded untill I can gather the needed 
paper work...(here I am dressed like a hippie)... or (here he begins to 
raise and lower his eye brows) I can figure a way to get it home... Trying 
to not be too grateful I calmly tell him I'll try and figure a way to figure 
a way to get it home.

There are probably more but over all, I'll attribute my good fortune to good 
maners and &quot;Busma&quot;.
