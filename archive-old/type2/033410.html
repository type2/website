Subject: Re: Husbands, Busses and Obsession

&gt;From my own experience I can say that once the interest in a bus begins 
(to call it an obsession is to make a value judgment), having a bus to be 
interested in (including all of the activity listed in the original 
posting) is preferable to not having a bus.

I became infected with an interest in having a VW bus on October 18th, 
1997. I had never even noticed the things before; what happened on the 
18th was a genuine &quot;Eureka!&quot; moment. It could not have come at a worse 
time; our family finances simply wouldn't permit of such a purchase.

For the next eight and one-half months I did indeed obsess about buses. I 
bought every book I could find about buses (there aren't enough books in 
print). I found this list (which had not yet split) and the Vanagon list, 
and read each posting. But worst of all, I discovered every bus within a 
five-mile radius of my apartment and then had to visit each one of them 
once a day. I altered my running route to take in about half of them, and 
the other half altered my driving route to work and back.

Since it was clear that I could not have the real thing, I gutted the 
interior of my Saab and made a &quot;miniWesty&quot; out of it. Horror of horrors! 
Every try to use a sink in a Saab?

I had that nasty heat-in-the-throat feeling that comes with unrequited 
longing. It went on for months.

And then Michael Wagner posted an ad for a bus with a price around $500. 
I went to see it, and I bought it on July 3, 1998.

I have had to spend a lot of time and money on that bus (which has a 
name: Peregrine [the wanderer]) but none of it has been obsessive. Just 
interested.
