It's a sad state of affairs and unfortunately, the Vallejo and Pleasanton
Shows (put on by Good Guys/Goodtimes,) have a notorious history of theft -
more so than other VW shows here in California that I've attended in the
past 25+ years.  I quit going to Vallejo for the past 3 years partially
because of rampant shoplifting and theft at the booth.  The Al Martinez
InterShows VW Spring and Summer Jamborees in Southern California are just
as bad and I have quit going to those altogether just for that reason.

I did attend Vallejo this Sunday and fortunately, I came through unscathed,
but most of my stuff is locked away in display cases these days.
