I would argue that if your bus *does* these speeds comfortably, you need to check your speedometer.  :)  Or maybe our ideas of &quot;comfortably&quot; are simply different?

Comfortably to me means about 1/4 throttle, decent mileage, nice cool temps and having extra power in reserve for passing, etc..
