Folks,

I have been dealing with Wolfsburg West in ANaheim via phone
orders as well as in person when I am in LA, and their service
cannot be beat, period.

Most folks on this list don't seem to know of them, but they are
at every major west coast VW show, giving away their great catalogs
and making friends.

Call'em at 714-630-9653

1051 Grove St, Anaheim,CA 92806
