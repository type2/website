Subject: Other carbs similar to 32/36 DFEV ?
Date: Wed, 11 Oct 2000 08:40:10 -0700

Talking with Scott Solomon today, and he mentioned that early K-cars and
Mopars of the frontwheel drive family used a Holley/Weber carb similar to
those offered as VW conversions by the usual SoCal, CalImports people. He's
right, because I used to have a Dodge Omni and the carb was marked Holley,
but looked almost identical to the 32/36. Does anyone know if these carbs or
early Rabbit carbs (I think they were Zeniths) are re-jettable or usable in
a centremount setup?
Interesting info for us people who like to tinker.
Thanks,
Courtney
