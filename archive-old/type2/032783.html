Subject: 914 2.0 IN '68

I have a Porche 914 2.0 litter that I would like to put in my '68.  I
have a couple of questions about the installation.
1. Do I need a knew tranny? If so what kind?
2. How do I get it to stay in there?
3. Are there any electrical modifications I need to make?
4. Are there any extra things I need?
5. Is there just a kit to do it all for me?
 Any help would be much appreciated!

Dion, 
'68 bus (Maud)
