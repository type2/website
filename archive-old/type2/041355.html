A guy I know bought a LOT of their tooling; not sure if they have any left!

&gt; Why not try Mark Stephens.  It seems that there are rumors of his
company's
&gt; demise and they might have a tool or two for sale.
&gt; His web site is still down and last month there were reports of no one
being
&gt; home out there.
