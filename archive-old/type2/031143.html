Subject: She no start!

I've got a 71 T2, mechanically unmodified as far as I know.  The PO said
that the engine was rebuilt about 2 years ago now, but I don't know (some
of the tubing doesn't look so great).  When I bought her a few months ago,
she ran well enough for a smooth 20 minute test drive and to get home,
besides not starting from the dead battery without a jumpstart (see
below).

I recently sliced the battery connectors (corroded so badly they were
hardly metal anymore) from the cables and patched on new connectors, as a
temporary fix until I can replace the battery cables entirely.  The
battery is brand new, and I get a full 12v reading from the battery and
across the connectors.

When I turn the key, she starts right up or the starter chugs 1-3 times
before the engine turns over.  However, the moment the engine vrooms up
and turns over, within a second, it shuts off completely.  I can't turn
the key back to start; I have to turn it all the way off and all the way
back around.  It doesn't matter if I give it gas or not, it just flat
dies.  It's been sitting for about 2 months since the last time it ran.

I don't have lots of tools or experience; can someone give me some things
that I can check out before calling a pro?  I have replaced nothing in the
engine thus far or even touched it except to check the oil.
