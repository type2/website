Subject: Starter, Solenoid, Both?

The subject line is the short story.

After checking out Bartnotek I installed the Bosch WR-1 relay and it still 
won't start.  Does this mean I need to get both a solenoid and starter? or 
will one or the other suffice.



Long story for those interested.

My wife and I took a brief respite from our duties as parents and drove about 
80 miles from Vegas to Mesquite (both NV).  Upon checking in at our hotel the 
bus would not start to move around to our room.  The hotel graciously allowed 
me to leave it in check-in parking overnight.

Next morning it starts up, but takes about three tries. We drive around most 
of Mesquite to do some looking, shopping, and classic car purusing (there was 
a show in town we didn't know would be there).  This involves much starting 
and stopping all with relatively few problems.  It sometimes took a couple of 
tries to get it the bus started, other times it fired right up.

Sunday, we gas up get breakfast and drive 80 miles back to Vegas.  Park the 
car in the garage, unpack, enjoy Father's Day and hit the sack.

Monday I climb in to go to work and nothing. A slight whir from the fuel pump 
(I think).  So off to work in the Mrs. Mobile, search the archives and find 
the Bartnotek articles. Stop by local VWAPS and pick up WR-1 relay.  Due to 
unexpected visitors I don't get around to installing the relay until tonight.

It was a very easy install. Hardest part was mounting the relay.  Try to start 
it up and nothing.  Headlights nice and bright. Oil and Battery lights come 
on. But nary a sound from the engine (including previous fuel pump whir).

So back to my original question, solenoid, starter, or both starter and 
solenoid.  I haven't checked the prices but if it's negligible I'll probably 
just do both.

Thanks for any thoughts on the subject.
