Subject: Brake booster for a '73

Anybody know a place for a cheap brake booster? Bus depot is getting $160 
for a rebuilt one with a $40 core. Any other solutions? I traced one major 
vacuum leak... The booster diaphragm!

I'm going to cap it off for now, not like it's doing anything anyway, but I 
really would like it to work...

Thanks!
