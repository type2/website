Subject: When to part out? '71

I am on the verge of buying a rolling '71 hulk and wonder about the 
moral and ethical complexities of yanking the useful stuff and 
calling a wrecker.  Here in the rust belt old busses are not long in 
the junkyards since there aren't a lot of people scrounging parts 
anymore.  It would mostly likely be crushed shortly after I sold it.

This is the condition.

Heavy collision damage in the front left.  Door on that side does not 
open and is currently held in place with a bungie cord.
Missing front turn lamps and one headlight assembly.
Heavy damage to both rear quarter panels, at least enough that they 
would need replaced to be fixed.
Rust thru in the back of the front wheel wells and battery tray.
At least two of the jack points are rusted gone.  I didn't feel like 
crawling under the other side.  Rockers are gone, rear wells heading 
that way.  Doglegs are rusted.
Sliding door came open with an extreme amount of coaxing and prying.  
Damage to the paint shows that prying has been done in the past.

There was no brake fluid in the container and brakes were reported to 
be working but not well.
Needs clutch, clutch cable or clevis pin.  I didn't investigate this 
closely yet.

The engine runs but has not been checked over well.  I am still going 
to do that since it's future sale is the only way I can finance the 
purchase of the bus.  I trust the rebuilder and installer 28,000 miles
back but I wonder what kind of treatment the thing got.  I will at 
least check the endplay as much as I am able and get some compression 
readings before I buy.

Transmission has been in use for one year and was from a junkyard.
CV's pass the move back and forth test and have intact boots.
Camping interior is in suprising shape considering the looks of the 
outside.  Former poptop now with plexiglass sunroof.
Tires are newer but not reinforced.

On the top is a very nice 3/4 rack.  This is the main reason I am 
interested in the thing at all.

What I am after is confirmation that this thing is ready for the 
crusher.  I am not super happy to be the guy that gets to do it.  I 
don't like the feeling of being judge and executioner.  However, the 
previous owner has handed down the sentence.

I will most likely strip everything from this bus, down to the glass. 
After I check the engine and secure it's resale I will be welcoming 
offers on parts or suggestions on how to start the liquidation.  Sorry
for the length of this.  It had to be done.  Jim
