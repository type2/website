Hey Y'all,
  I just have to tell you about the new Bus I got. I saw a Blue and
white 77 Bus sitting in a parking lot at Mc Chord AFB dorm. I stoped to
look at it and found that the owner was selling it. I contacted him and
he had had the thing for many years and just got a new Toyota P/U and
could not keep the Bus. We agreed on a price of $100, yes $100. The Bus
is a 77 2.0l FI manual trans with no sunroof or camper stuff, just what
I wanted. The body is straight with no rust, there is not even rust
under the battery. The paint needs to be buffed, but is good. The
interior is excelent except the front seats. New tires, with papers.
The guy had not started it for a while due to a bad starter solenoid. I
installed a new one and it started right up. I took it for a drive and
was amaized at the power, my other bus is a 70 with a 1600dp. I will
never go back to that after tasting the power of a 2.0l, what a
difference. I took it home and did a little checking around and found
all the lights work, the tires have only 10k miles on them, the jack is
there. It has new rotors, front emblem, spare tire cover and runs
great. Well I just had to share this, I am so excited about it. Thanks
for letting me share it with you.
