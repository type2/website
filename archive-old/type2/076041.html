Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Utility

&gt;Recently moved to new residence and filled it up with W/D and assorted
&gt;bookcases and rugs and fodder for the pantry and brought back a full load.
&gt;All functions nominal. Just what Herr Doktor Porsche had in mind for
&gt;functional utility under load when he first designed the T-II.

Hell as long as we're discussing utility, I recently loaded my bus up with
2,300 lbs (yes, really!) of ceramic tile, thinset, and mortar.  Yes, I know
I was a little over the GVWR but the bus handled it just fine.  I stayed
under 40mph and stuck to back roads for the ten mile drive home.  The main
reason I went for it in one trip was because of the smirks I got from the
goons at the Floor Store when I told them I had a one-ton truck... and then
I pulled the bus around!  Another time I carried 1,300 lbs of cargo plus
myself and two cats from Las Vegas to Dallas in two days.  Anyone else like
to load their bus down?  :-)
