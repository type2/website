Dare I suggest that the rust you see and have reported to the list is *only*
the rust you can see? Check the rockers, undercarriage and the heater tubes
thoroughly. Be careful! I suggest that you research what funds it will cost
you to have the rust repaired and body work fixed. Pay what YOU think is fair
