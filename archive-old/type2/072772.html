&gt;Also, Steve Blackham sent me some very detailed test instructions - thanks
&gt;heaps &gt;- are the numberings of the pins consistent on different in
&gt;different models? If &gt;i need to chase up a numbering plan is there
&gt;somewhere on line or will I need to &gt;chase a hard copy of a manual.


 Look in the list library (EFI Samick, I think)
(http://www.conservatory_dot_com/vw/manuals_nyx/L-Jetronic.html)
 or Bentley Page 21, fig 4-23 for a description of the numbering on the pins.


It's possible that your problem could be &quot;vapor locking&quot;.  Does you gas
line filter sit before or after the fuel pump?  Mine used to do this on
very hot days and with a hot engine because the filter was before the pump.
(This seems the logical place to put it but it could be causing the Vapor
Lock.)

Have fun

Some data of Bosch injectors:

       0 280 150 208 = 133 cc/minute
       0 280 150 209 = 176 cc/minute
       0 280 150 704 = 170 cc/minute
       0 280 150 614 = 189 cc/minute
       0 280 150 715 = 149 cc/minute
       0 280 150 716 = 134 cc/minute
       0 280 150 203 = 185 cc/minute
       0 280 150 201 = 236 cc/minute
       0 280 150 211 = 146 cc/minute
       0 280 150 121 = 178 cc/minute
       0 280 150 125 = 188 cc/minute
       0 280 150 114 = 185 cc/minute VW Transporter Type I
       0 280 150 116 = 185 cc/minute VW Transporter Type II


Typical values:

       Opening current 4A
       Holding current 2A
       Coil resistance 2-3 ohms
       Operating pressure 3 bar
