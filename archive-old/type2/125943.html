Josh
I didn't see a reply to this,,

sorry, I can't help you with the answer , I have the &quot;WESTFALIA&quot; decals on my
74, which I placed there, before this list existed,, so I didn't know I did
something &quot;wrong&quot; :-)
Here is a few photos that show the same place I put my decals..

Very scenic shots!

The &quot;Horse&quot; Decals were on the side of my 74 luggage rack originally


I wanted to know if you meant the &quot;Horse&quot; decals on the side, or the &quot;Westfalia&quot;
Decals on the front/rear ?
