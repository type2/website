Subject: ethanol

I was talking to a guy in my building that is currently doing a research paper 
on ethanol.

He mentioned that ethanol is corrosive for soft metal valves and gas tanks,
and all modern cars use hard metal valves and gas tanks.

Does anyone know what the air cooled engines/tanks use?  Hard or soft?

I'd like to use ethanol because it burns cleaner and has a higher octane
rating, but not if my engine is going to disolve:-)  

Thanks,
...Markus
