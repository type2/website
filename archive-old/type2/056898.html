&gt; &lt;snip&gt; how to integrate such a gadget with my 1776 engine.

If your engine is running 250 degrees, putting an external oil cooler on 
it is only a band-aid fix for some other problem.  If the engine is built 
right and is in good condition, a doghouse oil cooler is more than 
adequate for a 1776.

I have a 1776 I built in my 1968 crewcab.  It has the Berg pressure relief 
full-flow pump cover with ss covered lines &amp; oil filter.  The oil cooler 
is a stock doghouse and I have the thermostat flaps in the fanshroud.  I 
built the engine with 7.1:1 compression ratio.

In driving it on extended trips in the southeast with ambient temps 90 
degrees &amp; up, my oil temp is about 185 if I keep rpms down to 3200-3400.  
If I drive at 4000 rpms for over 15 minutes the temp goes up to 215.

I would check my engine condition or alter my driving style before I 
put on an external oil cooler.
