&gt;The pump does not &quot;suck&quot;.  The pump &quot;pumps&quot;, and Only if 
&gt;pumping, can the flowing oil develop a pressure drop on the inlet
&gt;side of the pump, allowing the net positive head of the oil to then 
&gt;enter into the pump. Once this cycle starts, the engine oil then 
&gt;comes in to fill the void on the inlet side of the pump, and the oil, in 
&gt;turn, is pushed out into the system by the pressurization of the pump
gears.

Sounds like the ol' &quot;chicken or the egg&quot; argument to me!!  

If it doesn't have anything to pump, it can't suck (I like the word suck
better than &quot;develop a pressure drop on the inlet side of the pump&quot;) and if
it doesn't have anything to suck, it can't pump.  Either way, you gotta have
something in there to prime the &quot;sucker&quot; :-).  

Disclaimer:  This flippant attitude is not meant as an attack or negative
reflection on Bob's excellent description of how a pump works, just having
some fun with the discussion.
