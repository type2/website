&gt; Well, yes and no. Bentley, in the front matter, empahsizes the need to use a timing light. Muir, on the other hand, rants against timing lights. Muir's chart shows 10 ATDC &amp; as far as I could tell that was static. Perhaps a VW is not a Macintosh where a person can get away without reading &amp; re-reading and thinking through the manual...

         That's for sure -- and don't take either manual for gospel.  Only take the infallible advice from us list members as gospel.    8-)
       However, when Bentley gives timing settings, they are *NEVER* talking about static -- they always mean with the engine running. In fact, I think it usually says &quot;at idle&quot; or &quot;at 900 rpm&quot;.  And those are the official settings. At least for stock engines with the proper stock dizzy. But maybe somebody put a different dizzy in yours,
so:
      If you truly have a single vacuum advance dizzy, I think you should forget about any settings of ATDC, they only work for the dual vacuum dizzys. I may be wrong on that, but I'm about 90% sure -- the second vacuum inlet on those dizzys is for retarding the timing, which is where you get the ATDC readings. Otherwise, with a single
vacuum dizzy, all readings should be BTDC. So if you do have a single inlet, you'd probably want to have a reading at idle of 4BTDC as David said, or maybe 7.5BTDC.
