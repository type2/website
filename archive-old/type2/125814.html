Subject: Re: [T2] shipping tranny

A 002 or 091 trans weighs approx 90 lbs. If shipping a used trans, drained, place in a garbage bag inside the box. If any gear oil 
leaks out it can get held up for a long time  and extra charges will be placed on the shippment. UPS fees really go up after 70 
lbs and Fed Ex after 90 (I think). UPS from east coast to west coast is approx 50 dollars.

&gt;&gt;NOTE:  Do NOT ship the tranny unless you've COMPLETELY drained the fluid!
&gt;&gt;Besides making it weigh more and making a complete freaking mess, it may
&gt;&gt;actually be illegal (do they consider 90-wt oil hazardous?)  
&gt;
&gt;There is a breather opening in the nose cone. If the transmission is inverted during the trip (guaranteed right?) all of the gear 
fluid will leak out.
