Roger,

I towed my 78 Westy from Dallas to Augusta, GA behind a 4.0l Jeep Cherokee.
I used a tow bar bolted *thru* the front bumper.  I set c/c _at_ 70MPH the
whole way (with a tranny oil cooler) with nary a problem.  In fact, I didn't
even drop the axles on the VW to prevent *possible* tranny damage - brought
her home, started the resto, and everything was just fine!

I suspect from your post that you'd rather not try a cross-country on your
first trip in a Bus.  Of course, some of the appeal of VWs is learning the
hard way - on the side of the road...but, consider parts, tools, etc.  I
recommend towing - learning in the comfort of your garage/shop - and *then*
tearing-off on a long trip.  Just my .02

Cheers
