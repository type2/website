Subject: re:partly camper

I &quot;partly campered&quot; my '68.
wut i did.
Got a full-width z-bed from a junker and replaced the
foam. With moderate hassle I got it in and gave the
old backseat to another Type 1 person.

Took out the center bench seat and got a folding table
from a junked westy and bolted it in.
I found junked jalousie windows in various states of
disrepair, but it didn't seem worth the trouble.

If I need more seating capacity, i can put the center
seat back in.

That's pretty much all i need for camping. I cook
outside on a stove.

Unless it's raining or I'm taking shelter in a parking
lot or rest area, I prefer to sleep under the stars
anyway.

I was planning to put mosquito netting over the back
hatch opening, the side door and the front open
windows for bug-free ventilation. but it's been so dry
the skeets haven't been a problem this summer.
