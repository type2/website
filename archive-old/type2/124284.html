Subject: correct temperature?

Hey bus brothers,.

Can anyone help out with what the proper operating temperature of a 71 dual
port should be....{on average}
just installed a temp. gauge today and after a 20 min. ride in 70 degree
weather on mixed terrain, the temp was hovering around 210.
how normal is this?
Oh, btw, thanks for all the timing and carb adjust. tips on the solex 34 pict
3. the pop rivet in the throttle plate really helped smooth the idle and let
me use the air bypass accurately

rock on,
