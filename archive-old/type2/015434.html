&gt;Hi!  This is Karen of &quot;Landon and Karen&quot;.  Landon is off blowing his money

Suggest you have a hydrolic lock. The float valve in the carb is not
sealing. Gas overflows the fuel bowl and leaks down the carb. Some dribbels
out at the shaft, but most runs into the cylinders and fills one or more. 

Do this. Pull the dip stick. Does the oil smell like gas? Very thin? Yes?
Change the oil. Remove the plugs. Turn the crank through two revolutions by
hand. Then charge up the battery, hook up the charger to the battery before
you plug it in. No sparks, please. Then set up a fan to blow fumes out the
door. Lay on the starter for a count of 5 with a count of 5 between say 5
times. This will purge the remaining gas from the cylinder/s. Install new
plugs. Put on a factory fuel pump. Replace the float valve. Fire it up and
hope the oil dilution from the raw gas has not damaged the cam lobes or
bearings or oil pump since the defective aftermarket pump was installed.

If Landon has money for Vegas, and you for shopping, you should both cut
back a hair on those expenses and save money all around in the long run by
spending more on keeping all things maintained stock per factory, as close
as you can get.

Not feeding and caring for your Bus at least as well as you would for your
child or dog is unconscienceable. You would bive them both all that they
need and more for what they want. Do the same for your Bus. It wants to
perform as intended with reliable purpose. It needs most to be as
originally designed in order to do that. 

It is always potentially huge to do otherwise.
