Subject: Re: [T2] bus accident

It looks as though the A pillar is bent, along with the door, and the
front panel.bumpr, etc.
How's the top edge of the dash??

Take the Bus to a body shop of your choosing and get an estimate---on
your own.

Then, you'll have a better idea of what it's really going to cost prior
to the young ladies insurance company trying to bush you on the price of
the repairs.

They will low ball the heck outa you.

You can do your own parts pricing on the internet.
But don't give them the price your paying.

Add at least 25% to the prices---

Why?

Because they are going to chop them up anyway 20- to 30%

What--you get some snow down yonder the other night too?


Take a real good look at all the damage and write it all down as your
looking on a legal pad.

Then go shopping.


Have Fun,
