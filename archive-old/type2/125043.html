Subject: Re: unsticking stuck bleeder valves

&gt;I am going to try your tip on the next #_at_$%!! stuck bleeder valve I
encounter.
&gt;
&gt;I don't know why it works, the way you describe it?? But I am going to try
it anyway.


The real techies will hopefully jump on this, but I think that somehow there
is a sort of 'capillary effect' whereby the paraffin is drawn deep into even
the smallest voids in the rusted threads.  All I can tell you is that the
last time I did brake work I couldn't get a couple of the valves out for
anything:  long rounds of heat, tapping, more penetrating oil (while cool
and when warm), you name it.  The paraffin backed 'em right out.  I got the
trick from a GM pipefitter.  No guarantees, just hope it works for you.
