Subject: [T2] Westfalia and other parts for sale

I cleaned my basement this weekend and took inventory

longer need.  Here is what I have and prices, these
are all more than reasonable, just add shipping and
you can have before the holidays.

For 74-75 can also be used between sink &amp; Fridge $15

1970 Upper cot a little dirty but strong and complete
