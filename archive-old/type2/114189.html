Subject: Re: [T2] need FI manual

Hi Joel,

Not sure if you mean a VW specific manual or the one which is the same size as a Bentley manual because it is a Bentley manual. If the latter then you can get it from http://www.bentleypublishers_dot_com/

I bought this just before I got my new bus with its 1600FI engine and found it to be a very good read, good for non FI people too as it explains carburation as well.

Good luck

&gt; does anyone know where i can get a copy of the
&gt; EFI book?
&gt; 
&gt; i used to have one, but traded it away to someone who
&gt; needed it.
&gt; 
&gt; now i have a bus with FI &amp; i would like one of these
&gt; books.  IIRC the cover was orange &amp; it was approx. the
&gt; same dimensions as the Bentley.
