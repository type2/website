&gt; &gt; So here I am in Maine freezing my baguettes off.  The Green Monster is
&gt; &gt; in the garage, where it has been sitting amongst empty beer bottles,
&gt; &gt; trash, and a container of salt ice melter that is just far enough away
&gt; &gt; from it so that it can't do any damage (I hope).  I don't have much to
&gt; &gt; do today so I just went out there with the battery that I keep inside on
&gt; &gt; the trickle, fired the bus up, and stared at it.  Which made my day.  I
&gt; &gt; thought you guys could relate, perhaps, to this feeling - just counting
&gt; &gt; down the days/weeks until it is safe (and warm enough!) to get the thing
&gt; &gt; back on the road.
&gt;
&gt; i'm with bob.  i drive goethe the two tone bullet all year long, when she
&gt; runs.  st. louis doesn't get as cold maine but i still drive w/ coat, cap,
&gt; gloves, scarf, etc. on.  though i do worry what the salt on the roads will
&gt; do to 27 yr.old metal and undercaraige(sp).  not to mention the other
&gt; hapless and helpless drivers on the road.  she's your baby so do as you
&gt; will.  who knows, maybe you like a warm car and lower insurance premiums.
