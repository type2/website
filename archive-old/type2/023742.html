Hi volks,

 I too was of the opinion that the &quot;hill start&quot;, as it's know in the UK,
was a standard part of driver training and would expect it to be taught
to anyone who intends to drive a &quot;standard&quot; car.

 In the UK, you can sit your driving test in an automatic car but then
you are only licensed to drive an automatic. If you sit in a car with a
standard/manual transmission then you can drive either. Needless (hmm,
maybe it isn't...) to say the vast majority of drivers choose to sit
in a manual. The majority of cars in the UK have manual gearboxes.

 Surely a similar scheme applies in the US? I can't see how it would 
be safe to license someone to drive a car with a manual gearbox 
without verifying that they can carry out a hill start.

 I'm wondering, though... there's the &quot;emergency brake&quot; or &quot;parking 
brake&quot; terminology: In the UK this is called a &quot;handbrake&quot;, it's
used routinely (practically every time you move off, certainly 
whenever there's a slope)... perhaps this isn't taught/done in the
US? I believe that drivers of auto-tranny cars are recommended to
shift to neutral and put on the handbrake when stopped, though I
am sure this recomendation is widely ignored. Similarly it's not
uncommon for manual-tranny cars to be stationary with the clutch
in (ie not in neutral), despite the wear on the throw-out bearing
or, worse still, to ride the clutch on a gradient.

Cheers,
	 W.
