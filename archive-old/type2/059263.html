talking

&gt; &gt; about, i need heat in my bus and was just planning to put a aux space
heater

&gt; 

&gt; Adam,

&gt; 

&gt; I think what they are talking about is a blower fan that sits on the top 

&gt; of the engine compartment.  It has two tubes on either side that run to 

&gt; the top of the heat exchangers.  The blower sucks air from the engine 

&gt; compartment and blows it through the heat exchangers all the way to the 

&gt; front of the bus.

Heat is possible in a VW bus with out adding an aux heater for use as the sole
heating method.  Last year I took my heater system apart, and
repaired/replaced the cardboard tubes that run from the back to the front of
the bus, and cleaned out all of the crud that accumulated in their from the
past 19 years (I have a 79).  This served to open up the passagways for the
heat to flow freely to the front of the bus.  As long as all of the components
are clear, and sealed from drawing in outside air, you will have a good
heating system that will keep the vehicle warm while driving.  

The blower, only helps at idle when the fan speed is not sufficient enough to
blow heat through the entire system.  I find that it is barely adequate, but
there is still some flow while sitting at idle.  In fact my system is good
enough to blow all the crap out of the system that I could not get while I had
it apart.  If you put an aux. fan in the system, ensure that you put it in the
front of the bus, as the heat exchangers put out HOT air, not just warm air. 
It will melt the fan if you put it back by the &quot;Y&quot; under the back seats.

I was reading an old car magazine article (Road &amp; Track if I remember
correctly) for a review of the bus(late 69 model if I am not mistaken, as they
commented on the size of the wind screen)and the test drivers were rather
impressed with the amount of heat that the VW system put out.  When your
vehicle was new the heat was adequate for all but the coldest locales.  

Others on the list have put insulation around the tube that runs from the back
to the front, and have increased the temperature of the air that exits from
the vents significantly.  Though the first order of business is to get your
heating system in good working order, and then make adjustments, if the air
coming out is not warm enough.  You should find that for many areas the stock
system is adequate, and with a minimal of upgrades (insulation, booster fan,
etc) you can get good heat for less than the effort of installing a gas
heater, but the key is to ensure that your system is good first.

Just my $.02
