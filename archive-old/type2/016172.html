It's probably the cylinder head temperature sensor.  It is located on the
drivers side head (#3 cylinder) and has a white wire that runs to it from
the main fuel injection wiring harness.  Wire may be loose, but if the bus
runs fine until it warms up the sensor is probably bad and needs replaced.
Fairly common preventive maintenance part.  It screws in and out much like a
small spark plug with a wire attached to the top of it. About $15 at the
local import parts store or online retailer.  If this doesn't work the air
flow meter also has a temp sensor built into it.  Try the cylinder head temp
sensor and let the list know if that fixes it.  Good luck.

Subject: [T2] Running problems with a 78 fuel injection Bus


I recently picked up a fuel injected 78 Bus.  I picked it up fairly cheap,
the previous owner said he had problems keeping it running.  I got it
running pretty good for a day or two (just driving it around the
neighborhood) but now it is doing what the PO had said.  It'll start up but
when it starts to warm up it doesn't want to run.  I've played with the
timing and checked all the vacuum hoses but that hasn't helped, any ideas?
Thanks.
