Marcus/List,

Very interesting.  I wonder if they increased the compression ratio on
these motors?  I used to have a '69 Toronado that ran 10.5:1 CR and had
to use 100LL aviation fuel mixed in the gas to get it to run well.  For
a while it ran a &quot;dual fuel&quot; carb set up and did much better on propane.
Would the lower CR bus motor &quot;waste&quot; the very high octane of the propane
(I think its between 115-120)?  Just a thought...

&gt;I don't know about the hybrid, but electrical conversions were done
&gt;professionally in Germany during the 1970s. IG T2 has just acquired one
&gt;of these buses. Just follow the link for pictures and information (in
&gt;German).
