The 'correct' way of fitting the arm is with a pin and 'horseshoe clip'.
These are readily available from VW suppliers.  Last shoes I bought (German,
but don't remember the make) had the necessary hardware, in fact they came
with a spring clip that is an improvement over the old horseshoe clip.  You
can use a normal screw and locking nut, but I'm not sure if the plastic in a
nyloc nut would stand up to the heat.
