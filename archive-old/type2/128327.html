Subject: re:flywheel rattling

&gt; did you pull the flywheel and look at the dowels?
&gt; are the holes buggered
&gt; up?
&gt; there is a jig that allows 4 new dowel holes to be
&gt; drilled in the crank
&gt; without breaking the case open. so essentially you
&gt; have an 8 doweled crank
&gt; end but you just use the 4 new holes.

I had this done a few years ago on my 65 double cab
engine, in a VW shop in Minneapolis/St. Paul (a couple
hours drive away for me).  Took the complete  engine
in one morning, they had it ready an hour or two
later.
I'd want to find someone with the tools and who had
done it before.
