Subject: Road Trippin

Hi all,
is there anyone who has done a cross country on a
northern route (Washington, up into Canada and then
across) who could recommend a route. I need to go from
San Francisco to Chicago in five days. Is that
feasible? Also I'm wondering if anyone has had luck
with a particular type of gas or propane heater?
Peace,
Giles
