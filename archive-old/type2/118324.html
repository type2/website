Subject: 75-79 Exhaust?

Hello List,

 

I have recently acquired a pipe mandrel from a closed down exhaust shop.
The price was right (free) so I had to take it.  It also just so happens
that my 77 Westy needs a new exhaust system.  Now that I have the tools
I'm thinking of trying to construct a system just like the old stock
one.  Would anyone else on the list be interested?  Depending on my
initial results and the time it takes I might be willing to produce a
few more.  It wouldn't be anytime soon but at least within the next few
months.  I will be using all new stainless parts with the exception of
the heater boxes.  Let me know if you are interested.

 

Eric
