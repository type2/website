Subject: How to buy a bus? (Newbie)

Howdy folks...I've been reading the archives and have found them
incredibly useful.  I'm sure I'll use them frequently once I finally buy
a bus.

I have a line on a '70 &quot;plain old&quot; bus that I might buy soon, but I
wanted to ask this list what things I should consider, look out for, or
take into account when evaluating a bus.

So, what should I beware of?  What would turn you off/on about a
potential bus purchase?  I looked at a pop top '79, but it was leaking a
lot of oil, kept discharging the battery (alt or v-reg, I guess), and
was a little rusty.  That's all stuff I'd look for when buying any car,
but I figured there would be things that you bus enthusiasts would look
for in particular.  

I'm pretty mechanically inclined, and I have an old car I monkey with
now and again (http://www.seanet_dot_com/~dawfun/tbird/).  It's not a bus,
but it's old and requires maintenance I'm comfortable doing.  Having
become pretty knowledgeable about Thunderbirds, I know what quirks those
cars have.  These busses have to be quirky too, no?  I plan on
maintaining this bus myself, and would like to know what that really
means...what will I find myself maintaining most often?  :)

Anway, that's it for now.  You'll hear more from me once I buy one, but
I'd like to hold off until I hear some of you sound-off on how to buy a
bus.

Enjoy,
--
