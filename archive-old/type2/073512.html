Subject: Re: [T2] Friday Westy question

&gt;Here is a friday question.  When you sleep in your camper, do you find it
&gt;more comfortable with your head to the front or to the rear?
&gt;(Forgive me, it's a slow day at work!)

I sleep with my head aft, more of a habit than anything. As someone 
else mentioned, I do like having my head near the opened, but 
screened hatch, when it is a warm night.
