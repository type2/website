Subject: A couple of final questions

I noticed the oil filler tube isn't centered in its groove on the
muffler, but is just touching one side. Is this going to cause any
problems? How can you adjust the position of the filler tube? Can you?

Also, I was putting the three rear tin pieces back in after painting
them with high-temp paint (NICE matte black finish!) and the last screw,
the one that goes in UNDER the engine and connects with the fastener
under the fan belt -- the screw fell in the heater box. Is that going to
cause any problems?

I must say, the new engine seal looks loverly. I'm very proud of myself.
I think the old engine seal qualifies as toxic waste -- EW!
