&gt;&gt; &quot;I have them in black and brown.  Incredible difference in price,
&gt;&gt;  though: $1.99 in black, $14.95 in brown.


&gt; That makes my blood boil. Absolutely inexcusable.


Simple explanation, actually.  The black ones were also used on Rabbits,
Golfs, Jettas, etc., so there is a large market for them.  Therefore they
are made aftermarket, and competition drove the price down.  The brown ones,
on the other hand, are found almost exclusively on '80-86 Vanagons; hence
not a large enough customer base to interest the aftermarket manufacturers.
So when you buy a brown one you are paying for a part on which there is a
monopoly, Volkswagen being the only supplier.
