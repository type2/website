&gt; WHAT IS GOING ON?

Luis,

You have a leak in your gas tank vent tube.  Alas, you cannot see the
location where the leak is, you can only feel it.  First, look in the
vents on the driver's side rear corner of your bus.  You will see a thin
metal tube coming up and doing a U-turn then going back down.  This is an
anti-siphon loop in the gas tank vent system.  Now go to the rear of your
bus, open the engine compartment and feel around behind the spare tire
well for the two ends of that line.  When you locate them, trace them
forward and back.  One of them has a junction in it with a 2&quot; lenght of
rubber tubing which will be severely degraded or missing.   This is the
source of your leak.  Replace that tube.  You should also look at the same
tube on the passenger's side.  The location is different, but it is
probably not in any better shape.
