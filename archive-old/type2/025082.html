Subject: Oil temp limits
Message-ID: &lt;9cfe481d.246a733a_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Leslie: I have a 1982 guide book published by HP Books entitled &quot;Baja Bugs&quot; 
by Jeff Hibbard on preparation of VW-based vehicles for off-road operations. 
It contains this statement regarding oil temps: &quot;The desired oil-temp range 
is175F-225F(80-107C). The absolute limit is 240F(116C)&quot;. Doesn't say where he 
got his numbers but I would guess that they may well be based upon extensive 
experience (read engine disassemblies) from operating in a very hostile heat 
stress environment. My oil temp sensor is located at the outflow of my 
secondary oil cooler and thus measures the coolest oil temp in the system. 
I've adopted Jeff's oil temp recommendations for my highway driving based 
upon the above assumptions and because I haven't found a better rationale 
elsewhere. Ray . 68 Kombiwagen, 69 Transporter.
