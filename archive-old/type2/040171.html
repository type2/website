&gt; Hi folks:
&gt;
&gt; I just returned from a trip to New Hampshire. For anyone who might be
&gt; interested, there is a junkyard in or just outside of Keene, NH which is
in
&gt; possession of a later model air-cooled Westy.
&gt;
&gt; Regrettably, I don't have the name f the junk yard, but its located just
&gt; across the street from the fair grounds. I believe the fair grounds are
&gt; called the Cheshire Fair. Should be fairly easy to find.
