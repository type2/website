Subject: Re: [T2] Replacing windshield seal use sealant!
References: &lt;NFBBLHANGMFCLCLIDNLMCEGBCBAA_dot_derekmay_at_home_dot_com&gt;

If you don't use sealing compound between the seal and the frame it will
continue to leak and is also not safe.  This is commonly overlooked when people
replace windows on their buses.  After fighting with my windshield trying to get
it back in after replacing the seal i gave in and called in the pros.  the
installer said it was the hardest glass he'd ever put in and took quite awhile.
i asked him why he was putting sealant on the frame of the window he asked me if
i hadn't used sealant on the other seals i replaced., i told him no and he said
i should pull them all off and use sealant. without sealant water can get
between the seal and the frame so it isn't water tight and also promotes rust
because the water can get trapped. The installer has done several buses and said
he found rust on every single frame.  he said he also found no sealant on any of
them and said if there was sealant there would be no rust but without it it was
a guarantee that there'd be rust.
hope this helps someone
jamie
ps i really wouldn't use a hammer on glass. i did this once and cracked the
windshield
