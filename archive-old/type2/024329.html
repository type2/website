I recently came into my hometown and visited the local volkswagen junkyard its been around for years and there is probably hundreds of volkswagens on the lot however this time I went my eyes beheld a terrible sight they went out of business and decided to crush all of the vws many busses(some with what were very nice camper interiors now fully crushed to oblivion) also bugs and things and ghias and squarebacks I managed to pull off the hammock from a 71 westfalia  which had its roof vertical to the sliding door and its side completely crushed  with the interior turned to splinters the hammocks canvas has a very small hole in it and the brackets at the end have a little rust on them and one is slightly bent but could be fixed easily the owner gave it to me for free because otherwise it would have had the same fate as the rest of the other cars I am wondering if anyone is looking for one of these- maybe pay for shipping and its yours-thanks.
