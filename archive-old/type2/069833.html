&gt;
&gt; I would like to hear from anyone who has used the following
&gt; suppliers for door &amp; window rubber:
&gt;
&gt; BusBoys
&gt; Rocky Mountain Motor Works
&gt; Vintage Parts
&gt; West Coast Metric
&gt; Wolfsburg West
&gt;
&gt; I would appreciate comments on fit &amp; finish, quality of material,
&gt; etc.
I used a couple hundred bucks of WCM rubber on my '67. I replaced windshield
seals, rear window seal, and rebuilt the entire driver's and passenger's door
window assemblies. I noticed a few of the seals were actually stamped with the
VW/Audi logo. THe quality seemed to be fine, and everything went in pretty
well. I've had it all done for about 6 months now, and no problems. The only
nasty part is the vent window seals. They are big and thick, and hard to get
in. They are hard to seat in general, and are still stiff when closing those
windows. Ironically, they were among the authentic VW seals...
Anyway, not a bad experience...
