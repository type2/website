&amp;gt; As far as safety, in a major front end hit where does the steering column

&amp;gt; Let's just face that VW buses are not safe and especially if the brakes are
&amp;gt; not maintained well and realize we are living on the edge!

Well said.  No vehicle is safe, but the utility of the VW bus comes with
compromises that eliminate the &amp;quot;cocoon&amp;quot; of crush zone enjoyed by
more modern car

The most important safety component in a bus is the nut that holds the
steering wheel.
