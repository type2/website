...
Does anyone have the web site address for CB Performance?
Thanks,
ED

&gt; &gt; BTW guys, the $19.95 Unisyns are worth around $19.95. The $50 models are
&gt; &gt; worth $200  (if you have ever used one).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; :-)   (I'm serious).
&gt; 
&gt; He's serious, the  $19.95 Unisyns are overpriced, Fuel injection is
&gt; easier, they didn't have the $50 when I switched to FI,...mighta kept
&gt; carbs
