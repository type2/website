&gt;  So is anyone going to any shows over the next few months? 
&gt;  i know there is bug jam next weekend, for those who like to 
&gt;  party, and also vanfest in september, both of which i will 
&gt;  be attending, and perhaps the london to brighton run to the 
&gt;  sun.....
&gt;  
&gt;  any takers? 
&gt;  anyone fancy meeting up with other european list members? 

Hi Helen et al,

Those of us in the UK do meet and chat at the UK shows, its unusual for me to 
go to a VW show without meeting at least one other past or present list 
member. Its just not on a 'formal' basis.

If you, or any other list member. wants to say hello to another list member 
come to the Type 2 Club stand at VANFEST and ask for me. If you've been to 
British Volkswagen Festival or VANFEST in any of the last 8 years, I've 
probably taken your money at the gate anyway.

It's appropriate now to remind you that there's still time to make a CHEEPER 
advance booking for VANFEST, details on www.soft_dot_net_dot_uk/vwt2oc.

See you there.
