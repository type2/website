Subject: RE: [T2] Bus Depot Search Engine

&gt; I didn't know about the layered searches.   I actually think  
&gt; that is a smart thing.  You probably should put some of that  
&gt; information on the front page of the website. 


You're right. I took your advice and changed the website. I had the info on
our Help page, but nobody reads that page. :-)
