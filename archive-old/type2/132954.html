Subject: Re: [T2] No trip report and CV Joints

I had an axle pop off on me once. When I first got my current bus, the
outer CV on the passenger side was only finger tight...at least I'm
assuming.._dot_can't see why else it would pop off. Can't really see why
anyone would do that either...The only one on well enough snapped.


I heard a clank.... then repeating clanks when I let off the clutch...

No go...no va

The axle was banging all around under there. The bus doesn't go on only 
one axle. Had it towed home and torqued those bad boys up. CVs are still
in action 4 years later.
