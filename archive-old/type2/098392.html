Subject: PROCEDURE: Bleeding and adjusting brakes

&gt; Hello all, many thanks for past help, and here is the
&gt; next question for my van. I have a '74 van, and I am
&gt; having trouble with the brakes, they are still a
&gt; little spongy after installing a new master cylinder
&gt; and having the brakes bled.

Peter,

Over time I have found that spongy brakes after replacement are usually
the result of air in the lines. Bleeding brakes on a bus is a bit
different and a bit more complicated.  Do this:

1)  put both side of the rear end on jack stands, both wheels off the
    ground;
2)  crawl under there and back all four adjusters all the way off;
3)  on either side, advance the adjusters *evenly*, five clicks at a time
    on each adjuster until the wheel will turn only with some effort, then
    do the other wheel;
4)  at this point you are finally ready to bleed the brakes;
5)  bleed all four wheels while the back brakes are locked up;
6)  back the rear brake adjusters off, again *evenly*, two or thee clicks
    at a time until the wheel turns with a whisper of contact between shoe
    and drum;
7)  After you have both wheels backed off so that they whisper, get in
    your bus, stomp the brakes hard four or five times and come back out
    and check the wheels... free rotation, yes?  So move the adjusters out
    a notch or two 'til they whisper again.
8)  Repeat 6) and 7) until stomping the brakes does not remove the
    whisper, then back all four adjusters off by one notch.

9)  Drop the bus and check your brakes.  Better?

If you run into problems, the other possible (tho less likely) causes are:

o Flex lines swollen shut with age;
o Leaking wheel cylinder;
o You *did* put the O-ring between the MC and the booster, right?
o bad booster.

&gt;   The brake servo lines coming off the manifolds have
&gt; been connected, but I found a line that is not
&gt; connected. It has a line connector place on the other
&gt; side of the brake servo than the lines coming from the
&gt; manifolds, (closest to the front bumper), and there is
&gt; no line coming off of it right now, but it is a vacuum
&gt; place. The Haynes book calls it the Air Connector, but
&gt; it does not show where the line should go, or where it
&gt; comes from.

This connector supplies air at normal atmospheric pressure to the other
side of the booster diaphram.  There should be a hose connected to it and
that hose ought to run into the front frame near the arch for the axle
beam.  At that point, out of the weather and away from the road salt, it
should just be open to air.

&gt; Any help in this situation, will be glady
&gt; appreciated. Also my carbs are still leaking fuel, and
&gt; the idle is still not right, so I have decided to bite
&gt; the bullet and order a new weber single carb. This was
&gt; Charlie Mitchell's idea as well.

Well, as everyone 'round here knows, I am not a big fan of the webers, so
I advise you remove your old carbs carefully and keep them in a box with
pictures of how they came off, so you can rehab them over the winter and
reinstall them next spring when you get tired of the ice in your long
intake runners with the weber settup.
