Subject: A quick measurement

Hey Y'all,
I was wondering if someone could do me a quick favor. 
I need the measurement of the inside of a baywindow
westy floor from the front of the rear seat base
forward to the bulkhead between the cab and passenger
area, and the width from side to side.
There is a rug on that auction site I want to buy for
my bus floor, but I want to make sure it is big enough
to cover the floor. And unfortunately, the auction
ends in a couple of hours and I am at work and my bus
is at home.
Thank you!

=====
Peace, John Baker
