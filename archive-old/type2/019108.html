Hi folks,

I recently picked up a pretty decent Westy, 71, enough there to make it
very good again, PO seems to have been kind, runs great other than
abysmal electric situation under dash...

Bus Depot looks like a good source for parts... Comments? 

i have seen kits for interior panels for regular buses, will these fit
in the Westy postitions or do you have to make new wood ones?

Is there a replacement piece of sheetmeral for the dreaded windshield
rust area? Other rust looks minor and managable, pretty solid overall.

Has the little Westy stool and all.

Looking for:
	anyone have a good set of front top hinges for sale? Mine are toast.
Also looking for a schematic of the dash wiring for re-doing the
spaghetti up there.
	D/S rear side SOLID window glass, to remove that leaker withthe wing
window...

Also trying to track down a Key West busser named Pickles123_at_aol_dot_com Any
leads?

Thanks in advance,
