Subject: Re: [T2] Anonymous threatening letters left on my bus...
  Advice?

If the law says it must be moved every three days (which is quite 
possible in a big city as Boston w/ tight parking spaces), and it justs 
coincidentally moves from #15 to #17?    No, I'd say that is physically 
moving, therefore following the law. ......

-Cheers,
David
