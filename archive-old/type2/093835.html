Subject: Re: [T2] Haynes description of test plug

[...]
Had to  double check some stuff on the engine so i decided to take a 
closer look at the plug.  There is a low resistance accross  two of the 
pins that makes it look like a pick up.  with engine running i get a  
vaiance.  Though i cant find a description of it it is acting just like 
a magnetic pickup associated with crank sensors on newer vehicles.  
some  newer vehicles also have the same type of pickup in the front 
pulley setup.  I suspect it was used to feed a  piece of equipment that 
could check timing and dwell without using a light.  This would leave 
hands free for  adjusting.  An old  siemens series tester  is  mentioned 
but i cant find anything on it except a general  &quot;engine analyzer&quot;

&gt; Does anyone understand the pin out for the connector or have a 
&gt; description
&gt; of the &quot;computer&quot; it plugged into?  What else can the connector do?
