Subject: Home from BusFusion

Hi Volks,

Just a short message to get the word out... We're home happy and  
tired from another EXCELLENT BusFusion campout. Frank Condelli and  
his crew put on an incredible event as usual.... I went out early so  
I would be there in time for the jam session on Friday night and it  
was well worth the extra night out.

Details:
Much improved weather.
&quot;Franklin&quot; arrives at its first campout under its own power.
Great fun at the IronWorks Pub night Jam session
Good deals at the swap meet.
A spectacular Saturday night campfire jam session
Saturday night (Sunday morning?) campfire couch incineration.
A 450-mile return trip without mechanical incident.

I will post a longer report later when I get the camera unloaded but  
wanted to get my thanks out to Frank for setting up such an awesome  
happening.


Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
