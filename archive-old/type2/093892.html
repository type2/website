&lt;&lt; &gt; What's the best way to recondition the hard vinyl?


Do you mean reviving the 'dead' area?

If yes, I know of no magic cream that will rejuvenate it. Vinyl is not porous

like leather. It is man made. Once it breaks down, it is history. Anything you

smear on it will just sit on it.

 &gt;&gt;

Amen. BTW, stay away from Armor-All, the heroin of cleaner polishes. That
&quot;shine&quot; you get from using Armor-All is the solvent dissolving the plastic 
just
enough to appear clean and bright. Even on new surfaces, eventually the sol-
vent evaporates leaving a dull finish...Only another application of Armor-All
will bring back the shine....
