Sez I:

&gt;If we're not able to find another situation with donated bandwidth, we're
&gt;going to have to do some FUNDRAISING around here

Since last night I've gotten three offers to host the system, so I think
we're out of the woods.

Thanks very much to everybody--please don't offer money on the list anymore
though.
