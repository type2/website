&gt; I am looking for a new set of Pistons and Cyllinders 1700, Type IV. These
&gt; guys seem to have the best price for them that I found. $239.95 + Shipping.

I paid over $350 for a set of Mahle's new in the box about 5 years ago,
from a reputable long term VW supplier, yes they are still in business

&gt; They are said to be Mahle or aa. I have also emailed someone on the samba
&gt; who has a set of Cofaps for $200 + Shipping. Both deals &quot;sound&quot; good but I
&gt; just wanted to see what experiences you all might have had.

if it sounds too good to be true, ......

YMMV
