I think the parallel may be something along the lines of passion or 
obsession.  I fell hard for the dead in the 80's and spent all of my time 
planning for the next show; now I spend all of my time planning on what I 
will do with my bus.  I never had a bus to take to a dead show, but I pushed 
several and bailed one out of impound.  And all of my rides have at least one 
token sticker; once a deadhead, always a deadhead.

I am interested in turning the single seat in the back into a cooler.  This 
is the seat that is in between the closet and table.  I know someone who 
works in plastics that can fit a lining to it, but I am having some trouble 
coming up with a way to drain it.  My husband thinks we can have the lining 
be removable, and just lift it out to empty it, but I would rather not do 
that as it just puts strain on the plastic and my back.  I would appreciate 
any suggestions as to how to drain it out the side of the bus.
