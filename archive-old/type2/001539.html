hi all, i am having a bit of a problem with a steering box i have just =
purchased for my '73 the box seemed identical and it went in fine, the =
pitman arm fitted then when i tried to replace the locking nut it seemed =
too small. All the local dealers will only help if i had a part number =
for the larger nut. Does anyone know the number or size as desperation =
is setting in and the welder may well be coming out!!      thanks in =
