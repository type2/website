Subject: Brakes pulling to the left...
Message-ID: &lt;3740224F.3AF5_at_worldnet.att_dot_net&gt;

second question:

The dang brakes pull to the left. I would say the left front brake pulls
to the right.   Hardly there when braking regularly, definitely there
when braking hard, though not drastically so(it's not jerking the wheel
out of your hands or anything).  Just had the brake lines replaced and
brakes were bled and adjusted.  All other brake gear said to be in good
shape, ready to go.

This problem also is a minor pain in the bundolas.  One of the mechanics
at the garage doing our work for us sez that his '71 pulls to the left
also, he has not been able to figure it out.

Anything else we should be looking at?

Thanks.
