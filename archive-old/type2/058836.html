Subject: Final Paint Job for westy
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

I'm currently restoring a 72 westy, and I'm sanding the body rust and priming
it for the winter, and then doing the final paint job this spring, I am
considering doing it myself, because I have no money, but I'd prefer to get a
pro job, has anyone else had their bus painted, if so how much did i cost?
Thanks,
Shawn
