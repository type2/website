&gt; It seemed to run fine.  I have a lot of oil blowing, wondering if 
&gt; these lack
&gt; of connections may have something to with it.  The line running from 
&gt; the
&gt; intake boot to the oil breather is soaked!

I don't think lack of those connections is making your engine blow oil. 
  The Aux Air Regulator is only used to increase idle air when the 
engine is cold.

I also had a problem with my engine blowing oil (and the resulting 
soaked breather hose).  See:

Your engine should not be blowing oil all over the place and soaking 
that hose.  I believe that is a symptom of excessive case pressure 
caused by blow-by.  The symptoms on my Bus led me to have a leak-down 
test done, which in turn told me that my engine was worn out and needed 
to be rebuilt.
