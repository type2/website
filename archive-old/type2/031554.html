&gt; fine, the push rod is fine. This leaves the lifter and the cam. Is it
&gt; possible that the lifter collapsed?  It is a &quot;solid&quot; lifter (not hydraulic)
&gt; but I think they are hollow. What could have happened to the cam? I will

never heard of a solid one colapsing????

&gt; try and pull the pushrod tube out tomorrow and the lifter if I can.

go get one of those telescoping antenna like thingies with a magenet on
the end, great for pulling lifters
