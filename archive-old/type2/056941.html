Subject: Dipstick oil temp sender

Howdy All --
Anybody out here in the great Pacific NW (or anywhere else, for that
matter) know anywhere around here where I can purchase a dipstick-style oil
temp sending unit?  I'll go the east-coast mail order route if I have to,
but I would see and feel it in person first.  All the debating about
senders has got me very cautious....

Thanks for your help!
