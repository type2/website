Subject: RE: Fuel Pressure Gauge?

&gt;Awhile back I saw mention of someone installing a VDO fuel 
&gt;pressure gauge -- I've looked all over in catalogs, magazines, etc. 
&gt;for a listing of such, but don't see any. Does anyone know who 
&gt;sells them? Tried VDO's website (http://www.vdo_dot_com) but that's 
&gt;pretty useless.

I have one installed in the engine compartment of my 74 914 with fuel
injection.  It's a VDO 1.5&quot; gauge that I bought from Racer Wholesale for
about $17.  You can get a free catalog from them at
http://www.racerwholesale_dot_com/

I mounted the gauge in-line (it's mechanical) between one of the fuel
rails and the pressure regulator.  Makes setting/checking the pressure
VERY easy.  

I suppose you could run a gas line into your bus and mount it on the
dash, but then you've got more risk due to ruptured lines.
