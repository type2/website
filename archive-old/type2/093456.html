&gt;Machine shop person said that if the spark plugs show microscopic

&gt;the engine has bad or worn valve guides.
&gt;
&gt;Outside of the electrode is the other side from where the spark jumps.

Oh Oh !!
I just noticed this same thing on my NewBus #3 plug the other day
when I had it out and was trying to determine if it was practical to insert 
a CHT sender under that plug.

I have been wondering about those small blisters I saw, as I had never 
noticed them ever before on any other plug anywhere.
