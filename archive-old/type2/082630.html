Are you serious about selling those tyres? 
What are you asking &amp; will they fit on standard rims as well since I don't have a pair of 14x7's. 
I'm putting a single cab ute on the road in the near future &amp; it can afford to be a little more impractical in terms of tyres. 
 
Cheers

&gt; &gt;Can anyone tell me what the standard wheel width &amp; 
&gt; &gt;diameter are on a 77 bus? 
&gt; &gt;I think they're 5 x 14 but I could be wrong 
&gt; 
&gt; That would be 5.5&quot; x 14&quot; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;The front tyres are almost bald but since the bus 
&gt; is 
&gt; &gt;rear wheel drive they don't have to be very chunky 
&gt; &amp; 
&gt; &gt;I'll probably go with standard road 
&gt; tyres.....correct 
&gt; &gt;me if I'm wrong on that one &amp; should go to safer 
&gt; &gt;tyres. 
&gt; 
&gt; The consensus is usually that a C rated tyre 
&gt; with a reinforced 
&gt; sidewall is preferable...You should be able to 
&gt; find one with a 
&gt; block style tread pattern that is reasonable in 
&gt; off-road conditions. 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;The rear tyres, however, could probably do with a 
&gt; &gt;semi-offroad/4x4 style tread for greater traction 
&gt; in 
&gt; &gt;winter when we will DEFINITELY get snow. 
&gt; 
&gt; Well you can...there is not a lot of variety of 
&gt; off-road style 
&gt; tyres made for 14&quot; rims any more however there 
&gt; is one type 
&gt; still made by both Bridgestone &amp; BF 
&gt; Goodrich,available in 
&gt; Australia.But they aint cheap at around $180Aus 
&gt; ea. 
&gt; Presumably they will fit on a standard VW rim 
&gt; however I can't be 
&gt; sure...I have a pair mounted on 14x7&quot; rims and 
&gt; they fit nicely 
&gt; on those rims however.... 
&gt; 
&gt; Whilst these tyres will give you superior grip 
&gt; in snow &amp; muddy 
&gt; conditions and on dirt roads,nothing comes 
&gt; without a trade-off. 
&gt; You will significantly reduce you on-road 
&gt; handling with these 
&gt; type of tyres so be aware of that and consider 
&gt; carefully how 
&gt; much of your driving will really be in 
&gt; conditions requiring 
&gt; such a tyre. 
&gt; 
&gt; I bought a pair for the rear of my Double Cab to 
&gt; make for easier 
&gt; access on a dodgey road (well track really)onto 
&gt; a property I bought 
&gt; recently and whilst it certainly did help 
&gt; that,it made the on-road 
&gt; trip to the property a far less pleasant 
&gt; experience. 
&gt; The truck doesn't handle as well as it did in 
&gt; cornering,and is more 
&gt; suseptable to cross winds.Prior to fitting these 
&gt; tyres,it handled 
&gt; beautifully and always felt very safe at any 
&gt; speed.The softer sidewall 
&gt; of the off-road tyres doesn't do the VW any 
&gt; favours. 
&gt; 
&gt; As an addendum,I recently had a new road built 
&gt; into the property 
&gt; and lined with road base so the BF Goodrich 
&gt; All-Terrains are 
&gt; no longer strictly required. Whilst they have no 
&gt; more than 2000kms 
&gt; on them and changing tyres again seems 
&gt; extravagant,I am seriously 
&gt; considering removing them and going back to the 
&gt; 225s it previously 
&gt; had and felt great to drive. 
&gt; Hey,you don't wanna buy a good pair of slightly 
&gt; used off road 
&gt; tyres for van do you...? ;) Going cheap!
