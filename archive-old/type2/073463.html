&gt;After looking at it closer I think the Fox looks similar to the VW Polo and
&gt;Derby as sold in Europe in the mid seventies and early eighties (and the
&gt;Audi 50 which was the original) but is also sufficiently different to make
&gt;it another car. It would be interesting to know whether VW Brazil did this
&gt;one on their own, maybe using some existing parts, or that is a modfied Polo
&gt;adapted to Brazilian circumstances (much like their current Bus).
&gt;
&gt;&gt;That's quite a hybrid!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Was it a front or rear wheel drive  chassis?
