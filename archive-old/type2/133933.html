Subject: Re: [T2] Testing Carb diaphragm

Thanks for the feedback!

The spring was nearby, so I didn't have to get a new one.
The replacement rubber diaphragm baffled the guy at my FLAPS with the
spring-loaded shaft portion. The one in stock didn't have this, and
the shaft size was different.

I have a similar and recently-rebuilt Weber I bought, and it's 
diaphragm was just like it! New one in place.
It might have gotten a bit better, but flat spot is still there. Not
sure if I've learned to drive it better or power is improved.
Least my heart doesn't pump out of my chest when starting it anymore...

When I had it idling I depressed the pump by hand and the idling
slowed down...minor flooding?

In watching it I noticed a regular puffing of what looked like exhaust
(greyish smoke) coming from the passenger side lower.. seemed off of
heat exchanger pipe. But it is also near where my oil leak is. Right
after start-up and &quot;puffy&quot; enough that it didn't look like burning
oil.  More details upon request, and after I look harder.

Based on the feedback I've gotten, next thing to diagnose flat-spot in
acceleration is plug wires.  I replaced these 2 years ago with
screw-on-plug wires with proper cooling tin coverign grommet. Bus has
sat for those years but theres not more than 100 miles on them.
What after that?

- Dean
