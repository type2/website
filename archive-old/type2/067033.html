Subject: Re: Bus Points

Dave asks newbie question:

Haven't had mine on the road long enough to eat a set of points, my first  
engine mod after I get it back to stock is to add a set of those magnetic  
points (breakerless), is there a reason why you haven't changed to  
pointless ignition system (keeping your stock distributor)?  I assumed  
most long time bus owners had done this....

Also, could your coil be causing you to be eating points?

Thanks much!

Does anyone have problems with their points in a type IV motor.
I am changing points about ever couple months now and wonder if this is
normal.
