Subject: OG Sachs shocks?

Nice job on the shocks, but I've found you can't depend on heater hoses not 
to collapse when used in vacuum applications.

I also found that my brake booster ISN'T leaking! Woot! The hose had a
small crack that I missed in the dark. Woot! I went and bought some
heater hose at the new Kragen that just opened up literally across the
street from me. 5/8&quot; ID fits nice and snug. Not stock, but
functional...
