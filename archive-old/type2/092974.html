Subject: Re: [T2] Motor Changes For the Bus

Yes. And why not more often? Because a running Porsche 911 engine costs 
about $5K and that does not include an appropriate Porsche transmission at 
another $1K. And then finally most folks would have to pay somebody to do it.

VW Transporters do not attract alot of wealthy folks. If you've got money 
you can do better with Vanagons and Eurovans.

If you want a nice increase in HP and torque then buy a Corvair flat-6 and 
enjoy bolt in OEM HP figures of 110 HP and 140 HP. With some improvements 
in heads, injection, and exhaust you can see 175 HP easily.

However by this point you are halfway to a Porsche flat-6  - - - - but you 
have a new Corvair drivetrain versus a Porsche engine with mileage on it.

A 912 and a 356 engine are essentially the same as VW engines with some 
expensive refinements. The 912 is a well built Type IV basically, and the 
356 a well built Beetle motor. Both offer power and engineering refinements 
and a BIG pricetag.

A 911 engine is similar in concept to the Corvair but much, much, much more 
refined. For the money of a Porsche flat-6 I would move to a Subaru flat-6 
and do what it took to put a Porsche 5 speed and water cooling into the bus.

The Corvair is a basic pushrod engine just like the Type IV. It is 
substantial but lacked alot of refinement in their heads. The castings were 
poor and the carburetion was very limited on the 110 HP and the other lower 
powered engines. Otherwise these engines are durable and trouble free. They 
had alot of pushrod seal oil leaks until Viton material was used versus the 
rubber GM built them with. The 140 was a good engine but it requires some 
careful refinement and $$$ to make it run cool enough to push around a Bus. 
GM only supplied the cars with the 140 and 180 turbo engines because of 
overheating issues. GM gave up on the Corvair in 1964 or 1965 and major 
development stopped though production continued through May 1969. GM was 
not willing to committ to the refinements necessary to help the Corvair 
meet more and more stringent air quality standards (read fuel injection). 
The domestic car makers were more interested in large displacement muscle 
cars and at that point so was the buying public. If you wanted economy you 
bought a 6 cylinder water cooled domestic or an import like the VW or 
Japanese cars.

If you want 6 cylinders and a higher geared tranny for reduced rpm on the 
highway the Corvair is the winner. Parts are still easy to get and priced 
quite reasonably. Enthusiasts have continued to develop refinements for 
these engines to resolve things like head temp problems (simply clean out 
the poor head casting flashing with a $1.50 drill bit).

They are a well documented make. Core drivetrains can be bought for under 
$250 that require freshening up or rebuilding depending on your luck. 
Performance parts are available as is modern fuel injection and electronic 
injection. On supplier recently offered a 5 speed based on a Corvair 
transaxle and a Borg Warner T-5 tranny.

The Corvair has often been called the poor man's Porsche. Gm had the 
Corvair 6 cylinder 5 or 6 years before Porsche had the 911 six cylinder.

I am ready to assemble my Trans-vair (Corvair powered Transporter 
Westfalia). I can provide details to anyone that wants them.

&gt;I was just wondering , has anybody ever put a flat 6 from a porsche in the
&gt;bus ?? Like from a 356 or 912 or 911 ?? I was just curious .
