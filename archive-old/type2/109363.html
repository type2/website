Subject: Re: Bus Depot Beta Test

Just a note of thanks to those who helped me test the new site. I
apologize that I haven't had time to reply to your emails and thank you
individually yet, but I will. It's just that I'm still up to my ears
wrapping up the final issues, which are taking quite longer than I had
hoped. :-(   (You did a good job - you found lots of mistakes!)

I hope to have the site up early next week. (Or perhaps sooner if I'm
really lucky; I'd hoped to be done by Fathers Day as a gift to myself,
as I think I've forgotten what my 5-year-old looks like.)  I'll post a
note here when it's &quot;live.&quot; After a few days of making sure really does
work, I'll send the promised 10% off coupon codes to those who sent
lists of bugs, mistakes, and suggestions. Meanwhile, it's still up in
beta testing if anyone is inclined to look it over for errors. (Don't
worry, there are still plenty more to be found! :-)
