&gt;My point is that the old L-Jetronics are not that complicated. Bentley manual, VOM, and psi gauge for the fuel....

&gt;$2K? OUCH! &lt;grin!&gt;

I don't know the details but the costs add up when the mechanics can't diagnose properly.

For example, there was a thread on Samba recently where a clogged fuel tank (my original suspicion based on the symptoms) was incorrectly diagnosed by a VW mechanic. One new fuel pump, new double relay, new ECU, one very large bill later the tank still had to be unblocked.
