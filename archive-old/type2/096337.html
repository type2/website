&gt; Can someone advise which years of engine heads are compatible with the &quot;79;

79 are one of a kind BUT can be replaced with other 2L heads but the
exhaust system would have to be changed, and you need to make sure it is
set for hyd lifters which your cam would be.  easy enough to do but you
