&gt;As I understand it, the bodys for 72-79 was same. If so, will the

Waaahahahahahaa!
Don't drink water either, too much of it can cause drowning!  :)
Now go to any new car dealer in the U.S. and see if you can find an 
automobile for sale that is NOT fuel injected.  Yep, stay away from FI, 
it's evil.

&gt;If I were to swap engines, do I just have to change the flywheel and 
&gt;clutch or do I have to change the bell housing as well? How hard would an 
&gt;engine swap be?

All in the archives at http://www.type2_dot_com.  Sorry, I don't have the 
energy to post it again.
