Subject: Re: [T2] hightail it down to mexico

Steve, that was stupendous!! I love to read these writeups and live your
trip vicariously!! Thanks so much, I've only been to Mexico once with the
wife on a trip to Puerto Vallarta, and we figured out immediately that the
Mexican people are fantastic and caring. We only wish we'd brought our kids
along to enjoy these lovely people.
Thanks, that was great. I'm gonna keep it.
Regards,
Courtney ( a 50 yr old guy from B.C. who DOESN'T play Amazing Grace at
night) :-)
I surf the West Coast of Vancouver Island.
