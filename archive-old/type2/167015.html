&gt;Newbie here.  Just got a 1978 Type 2.  I took it to a local VW shop, and
&gt;they told me that the first cylinder has low compression,

How low?

&gt;and we should
&gt;probably replace or rebuild the engine, but the parts are pricy, so
&gt;replacing it is probably the best bet.

A head is cheap but paying them to remove the engine and put it back in is expensive so I guess they are recommending that you spend even more to help prevent the possibility of having to pay to drop the engine again in the short term?

&gt;What would you guys do in my situation (rebuild, used, wait and get a
&gt;rebuilt engine)

What's the rest of the engine like? Mileage? How did it run before?

&gt;I've been told the 78's are more difficult to rebuild, and the parts are
&gt;really pricy.

2L Type4 parts are more expensive than Type 1 parts. The 1.7L and 1.8L parts are getting harder to find...

&gt;How much are we talking?  How much does a used engine run?

Varies. It can be economical to buy two non working engines and make a good used one from both and sell what's left.

&gt;A rebuilt engine?

About $1500 +/- $200 for a budget rebuild.

$2500 and up if you want new parts other than P&amp;C from a reputable builder.
