Subject: valve clatter

1700 in a 72  westy and the valves clatter even after adjustment. I'm not an 
expert on T-4 engines and looking for any and all reasons so I can start 
ripping it down I hope not out. 

Thanks for any help

Mario

Sorry Snoppy works just crazy when your the only shop in town, email me I 
might have to come check out the collage.
