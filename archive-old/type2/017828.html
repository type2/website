Well, maybe not my life, but you guys certainly saved my marriage.

I've decided, against every nerve and fiber of my being, to Keep
Looking. The rusty '76 Westie seems to grow more oxidized by the day. I
visited it last night and saw that there is significant flakey rust
right below the windshield gasket. I also noticed that the windshield is
cracked.

The dealer Riviera with engine in pieces...well, it just gives me bad
vibes.

The best suggestions seemed to come from those of you who proposed that
I offer each owner $250 and combine (or part out) the two. Unfortunately
I live in a condo, and while it would be feasible to remove our back
fence and stuff both busses into our patio, then replace the fence, I
don't think it this would be a healthy move.

Meanwhile, I continue to read the list (and archives) with pleasure. If
anyone sees a low-priced '74-'78 Westie within shouting distance of
Southern California, give me a buzz.
