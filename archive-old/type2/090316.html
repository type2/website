There are many good books &lt;buy the bentley&gt; out there which cover many
different aspects of the late model type 2 &lt;buy the bentley&gt;. Some are
very simple  &amp; compound many years into one section. Some are funny to
read and  buy the bentley&gt; you can gleem many good ways to do some
&lt;buy the bentley&gt; of the common jobs. Some are more professional &lt;buy
the bentley&gt; &lt;and reprinted shop manuals. I can't tell you which one
is the best for you &lt;buy the bentley&gt; you most likely want to just
decide for your self &lt;buy the bentley&gt;. No, not pushing any of my own
views here. &lt;buy the bentley&gt;

Oh, just in case you have the feeling you should look into buying the
Bentley book here they are :) Plus many of our listees that run shops
will sell them as well.
