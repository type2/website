Subject: Re: [T2] Intake Runner Gaskets

If you want to go cheap go to Napa and buy their generic gasket material 
kit for $5 or so. Then cut to size. Use your old gasket as a template or 
the manifold ends.

&gt;Advance has something that may work that they list for
&gt;$14.99.  I do not want to spend that much.  I will go
&gt;and look at it today and see if it is even close to
&gt;the part that is needed.
