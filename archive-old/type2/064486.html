Subject: poison oak remedy for ingrown buses(not really VW)

&gt;and first/foremost
&gt;problem is how to get it out of the gully full of poison oak it's been
&gt;sitting in for long enough for pine trees to have grown up in the &quot;road&quot; it
&gt;was driven in on!

For dealing with poison oak, there's a great product called Tecnu or Technu.
It can be applied before or after exposure to the dread stuff -- even hours
after. Unlike palliatives like calamine lotion, this stuff actually breaks
down the poison oils. It works!

We got our bottle at a camping supply store some years back.

Hey, with all the campers on the list, I guess this has VW content after all.

Now back to VINs and brake pads...
