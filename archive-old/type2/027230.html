Hello,
Well I just got insurance on my bus, sure is expensive
if your young. So tonight I took the bus out for a quick
run to return a movie and get some gas. I had driven
in the neighborhood a lot before doing test runs, but
this was a big step for me! Kind was a bit nervous
because my cv joints are making some bad noises. The old
clunk clunk, only on hills not on turns. I live in
Tennessee so there is a lot of hills around here. If I am
going over 20mph it seems to go away. any ideas on telling
what one is going bad?
Any ways back to the story...
Made it to the gas station just fine and boy did I have
a big grin on my face ;) So to say the least I got home
just fine.
I had installed a new oil temp and pressure gauge and
tested the oil temp sender with boiling water.
Got good oil pressure and oil temp were around 215 F

So I'd like to say thanks to every one that helped
me by answering any of my questions that helped
me get my bus back on the road. Hopefully you guys remember me.
Also thanks to anyone and every one on the list,
you people are all wonderful!
Take care.

Alex Wisniewski,
77 Riviera w/79 engine
