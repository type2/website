Subject: [T2] Re: [VB] Announcement: i405_dot_com will no longer be hosting Archives, asked  	to remove

Hey there,
I'm new to this list and just got my first bus towed home last night.  
Its sitting in my driveway missing a good deal of parts from what the 
old owner told me.  There are a few things I need to get taken care  of 
before it will be running my friend says.  Would anyone be able to tell 
me what size tire would be the best for my bus?  What kind of tires 
should I get?  What octane gas should I use?  Are there any VW events 
going on in my area?  What is that light for on my dash?  Where can I 
find the brake fluid resevoir?  Who does mail order for parts?  Whats 
the best way to remove a generator?  What are some small performance 
uprgrades I can do to make my bus have a little more umph?  How can I 
tell what year my bus is?  Are there any bus owners from my area?  What 
books can I get on buses?

Where could I find some of this information????

There has to be a reason for the archives being taken down...


   A split window bus Bentley manual - $80
   The Idiots Guide VW manual - $30
   Being able to search through thousands of messages (written on buses 
by your friends and put up in a searchable index and hosted out of the 
kindness of fellow Vdubbers hearts) at 2:00 in the morning while sitting 
at the computer in your underwear drinking coffee - Priceless
