Subject: Re: [T2] so maybe the snow isn't so bad afterall

&gt; She did great in the snow with the chains.  I had to stop and
&gt; laugh at the neighbor kid in his old blazer that got stuck in the
&gt; cul-de-sac.  The bus just chewed through it all.  Here's a couple pics.
&gt;

Chains?!?!? Wuss.

I gave my chains to Troy. (Actually, I had 2 sets... heh)

The Guac did just fine without chains. I just got home after leaving
work and running a couple errands.

I love the SUVs that get stuck though. I have a coworker with a 2wd
explorer and she was wondering why she couldn't get through the snow.
LOL!
