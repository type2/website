&gt; I called this guy before driving 1.5 hours to see the bus. He assured me that it 
&gt; was in primo condition. If it hadn't been such a pretty drive, I think I would 
&gt; have left him in a shallow grave. He had book of the receipts for the bus going 
&gt; back to 1991, but curiously, none for the engine rebuild. Judging by the 
&gt; appearance and performance of the engine I guessed at 50K. He offered to fax me 
&gt; receipts for the engine work. To my surprise, he did, but they proved that his 
&gt; 3500 mile claim was off by some 37,000+ miles. The bus is worth under $500. Its 
&gt; owner is from Mars.

I had this experience again and again whilst searching for a bus. I live
about 2 hours from Portland, where most of the buses around here are for
sale. Ended up driving there 6 or 7 times, each time with a story just like
this. The worst was a guy selling a '71 camper, advertised as perfect
condition, etc. Got there to find that he was selling a bunch of cars from
his house, and this one was perfect except for the caved-in rear end, which
he had failed to mention. Expressed surprise when I mentioned that the engine
door couldn't be opened. &quot;Why do you need to see that? It runs fine...&quot; 

Also quite a few &quot;No rust at all&quot;, except for the rusted through battery 
area, and all the holes in the floor...

I finally scored. Just gotta persist,

Jon
