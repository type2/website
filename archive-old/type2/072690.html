I remember reading of someone on the list who just unfastened the sweep
contact board and moved it down a mm or 2.  He claimed it solved the
problem.

What exactly was the symptoms you were having.  I'd run the diagnostics in
the list library, testing the AFM before you replace or ruin a $350 unit.

&gt;With the recent discussion about the Air Flow Control meters, I thought
&gt;I might jump in ask a few questions.  I have a '78 2.0 FI engine.
&gt;Unfortunately, it's time to replace the Air Flow Meter.  I borrowed one
&gt;&gt;from a friend and all of my symptoms disappeared, so I am sure AFC meter
&gt;is to blame.  However, instead of purchasing a refurbished unit, what is
&gt;keeping me from refurbishing my own.  Has anyone attempted this?  I have
&gt;access to PCB design, layout and fabrication tools.  My understanding of
&gt;the problems with the units are the resistive traces which the AFC meter
&gt;sweeps against usually wear out.  I may be totally off on this one, so
&gt;correct me if I'm wrong?  Anybody have any thoughts on the matter?
