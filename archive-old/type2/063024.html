&gt; Chip,
&gt; 
&gt; When you find out they've sold you the correct caliper for $28 could you
&gt; post the address of this store to the list?  The cheapest I've ever seen a
&gt; rebuilt caliper go for (for my '71) is $58 and I've seen them as high as $80
&gt; (rebuilt!).  $28 sounds like a real steal.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,

Ron,
I was not to worried about it being correct until I received your
and others sceptical responses it has me worried. The lady said that
she would have to order it so, as soon as I can I will get it
and let y'all know. It will probobly be at least a week though.
I'll keep ya updated.....
