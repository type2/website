Subject: Re: [T2] Behr AC Help

A lot of earlier discussions on this topic have focused on the
advantages of using a newer and more modern compressor, often plucked
from a junkyard. Both because of more efficient newer designs and
because the smaller newer units can be fit without compromising the
engine tin and hence the cooling system.

 Hi, I'm new to the list and couldn't much help on this topic elsewhere. I
 have a 1980 Vanagon that has an aftermarket Behr AC system in it (I believe
 this came with the van when purchased as new as a dealer option). After
 messing with it and having mechanically inclined friends inspect it we
 realized the unit is intact and working fine, but there is no compressor.
 Does anyone have a Behr AC system and know what type of compressor is used?
 Is it possible that I could buy a compressor from another type of AC unit
 and use it on my van? Any help about these Behr AC units is much
 appreciated.
