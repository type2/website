&gt;.  My question for tune-up purposes is, is this possible, did VW make a carbureated 2000cc on a limited basis.  I heard they did by rumor, but i'd like to get some confirmation on that.  thanks a bunch, andy

 Yes, they did but they used Solex carbs, not Webers (AFAIK). Singles on 1600cc engines up to about '82 or so and twins on the bigger pancake engines from '72 to '82. They may or may not have used carbs on watercooled busses but I don't know and its outside the scope of this list, anyway! :-).
 Again AFAIK, FI was _only_ used in North America- the rest of the world used Solexes.

Cheers,
              W.
