Subject: Re: busses, environmental degradation (ramblings)

        It should not be assumed that an old engine is a dirty one, and 
that a new one is clean. The majority of emissions equipment on new 
engines functions to keep emissions low _despite the state of tune_. We 
all know that the majority of engines on the road need a tune up, and how 
many times have we failed emissions, tuned up the car, and then passed? 
        THe following is anecdotal evidence, but should help my point 
anyway. My garage mate carefully tuned his 50's rear engine FIAT, and for 
fun, took it to an emmissions station. It passed as a NEW car (this was in 
1992). There is a ramp from the highway we take often that is equipped 
with a smog sniffer that gives you the results on a billboard. My 1975 
Dodge truck with a tired, but tuned, 440 V8 gets the same or better than 
our 1988 Toyota, just tuned. The bus, which I have jetted rich until the 
engine breaks in, gets a &quot;fair&quot;. I do not give these roadside 
sniff-your-butt a lot of credit for absolute rating, but they are 
interesting for relative response.The difficulty is general air quality, 
which in denver can be very bad.
        The moral is, keep your engine in tune, use it less (ride your 
bike or the bus when you can), and you can feel virtuous because you are 
recycling, which is significant, as already discussed.
        No we can't reach the level of the Saab just tested in Europe 
that spits out air cleaner than what it sucks in (minus oxygen, 
presumably), but we are running an efficient design, and can keep it so.

IMHO, 
Chris
