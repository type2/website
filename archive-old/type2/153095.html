Subject: Re: Stranded ... Bus won't run. --&gt; Fixed?

today I got some great help from the neighbourhood mechanic.  I think
what happened was that the electronic ignition unit that someone
convinced me to install failed, and when I replaced the electronic set
with conventional points and condenser, some parts were missing.
Namely the screw to ground the condenser and a little tab or something
(perhaps?) to hold in the plug into the distributor.

So we found a donor screw and taped the plug in place, and the van was
running much more normally.  Still al little rough though.  He
suggested I reset the valves pointing out that the valve clearances
were much larger than .006&quot;.  I thought that I couldn't check the
valve gaps unless that particular cylinder was in firing position, but
he pointed out that the gaps should never be larger than .006&quot; no
matter what position the cylinder was in.

Alas, I think all my troubles (and my large towing bill) were the
cause of a faulty electronic ignition, and faulty installation on my
part of new points/condenser.  I'm going to do the valves in a couple
of hours when the engine is cool.  Then we'll see how she runs ... I'm
excited.  I hope this works.

I still think giving the fuel tank would be a good idea.  I'll ask
about that on list later, don't worry.

Thank you all for your support and help.  I wish you many millions of
miles of freedom and joy with your VW's.
