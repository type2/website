Subject: Re: [T2] middle bench seat seatbelts

Why not put a backup nut and a large washer under the bus to receive the
bolt?

 my mother-in-law arrives for a visit this afternoon, so i had to put the
 middle bench seat in for the extra seating.  One of the holes in the
 floor that receives the seatbelt is stripped / rusted / whatevered and no
 longer grips the botl.  having a 7 pass 6 seatbelt bus is OK i guess, but
 i would like to be able to have the option to belt someone into that
 seat.  is this another application for the timesert like when my oil
 drain plug stripped the threads out of the case, or am i looking at a
 more difficult fix?
