Subject: re: crankshaft pulley coming off

When I had mine off recently, I found that the washer behind the nut had a
crack in it. It is a special spring washer and needs to be oriented properly
when reassembled as well. This is a cheap part to replace from a VW parts
house or dealer. Be sure not to use a hardware store washer.

Good Luck,
Bill Moon
