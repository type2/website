You're talking about J-Tubes, here, I think.  I've seen them for Type I =
engines, but not for Type IV. They probably exist somewhere, though.

Back in 1997, there was a thread going around on this list about =
asbestos-free heater boxes, flap boxes, tubes, etc., being supplied by =
VWoA for no cost. They even came out and installed them. VW sent a guy =
from Dallas to install all this stuff on my '79 bus. Sweet - about $800 =
worth of free stuff, plus installation - all from VWoA. I think it had =
to do with liability concerns about asbestos-related health issues. I =
doubt that they'll still do it, but a number of list members got free =
heating systems that way.

Hello,

      I have a 73 bus with a type 4 engine.  My heater boxes are totally =

shot.  They are completely bare of the surrounding heater box metal and=20
function only as exhaust headers. My main heater tube has also rusted =
away=20
and I have no flapper boxes, etc.  I heat with a BN4 gas heater which =
meets=20
my needs for a spring and summer camper.  I had some concerns about this =
set=20
up.  Would the exposed exhaust headers overheat the cylinder heads?  Is=20
there some kind of header system available to replace the heater boxes =
with=20
tube-like header pipes instead of the finned heater box headers? I seem =
to=20
recall seeing something like this advertised in one of the VW magazines. =

Another option would be to fab and weld heater boxes around what I =
currently
have and I was wondering if anyone had ever tried this. New heater boxes =
are=20
out of the question because of their expense.  My main concern is to =
have a=20
functioning , cool running exhaust system. Any advice would be =
appreciated.
Thanks,  James.
