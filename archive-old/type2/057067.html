Subject: RE:commuting in the bus?

Tom-
I have always owned, driven, and relied upon air-cooled V-Dubs. There
is a bit of frustration that is involved with a 20-30 year old daily
driver. If you take proper measure in maintaining your Bus, you should
find that you can go anywhere you please.... just not too fast. Can
your Hontoyisan take you up that back mountain road with provisions
and facilities to camp-out, and than cruise you to work in the city
the next day?
I commute to work in my '70 Westy(35 miles) 5 days a week and drive to
Southern Arizona(from California) once a week(1000 miles r/t). I
average 65K a year. If you take care of your Bus, she'll take care of
you.
Another way of looking at this: You can rebuild your engine &amp; tranny,
new brakes, suspension and tires for less than fixing your other car :-)
Have faith my friend,
                 -Kent
