&gt; I have this same setup and I have every reason to believe that it's
the way
&gt; VW installed it (eg the hose coming from the tank is the original
one, it's
&gt; the only one I haven't replaced yet but I will be doing it very
soon).  The
&gt; filter doesn't weigh anything but I've cable-tied one of the hoses
to the
&gt; starter cable and this keeps it up out of the way.
&gt; If having the filter upstream of the pump causes vapour lock, why
did VW do
&gt; it this way?  I haven't had any problems with it.

I don't think that VW put any inline filters in buses, at least not
until fuel injection.  I think that the filter you are referring to is
an add-on.  Someone will correct me if I'm wrong!
