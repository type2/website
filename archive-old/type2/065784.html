Subject: timing and other stuff

Hi all
I am off the list for now because my twin boys were just
born and I am very busy. I do however have a problem.

I pulled my distributor and installed a Petronix unit. I also
adjust the valves at the same time. Now my bus won't start.
I think I need to start off by setting my timing staticly
to get it to start. Can someone please tell me how to do this?
I don't have Muir to refer to. Thanks

P.S. please cc me private e-mail since I am not currently
on the list.   :)
