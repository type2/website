I can't call my FI problems &quot;problems&quot; in the traditional sense. I'm setting up a system on an old bus with so many unknowns that it's not even funny.

I will note that in reading the Bosch FI book from Bentley Publishers (Probst, circa 1985), the L-Jetronic system was touted in that book as perhaps the most widely used FI system in the world.

Later. Gotta go camping. ;-) Joe
