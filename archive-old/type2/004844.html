Now that I'm doing hospital work for my architectural firm (after years of
retail and industrial), I'm a little more conscious of my dirty fingernails
and stained skin.  My wife the artist has recommended something called
Invisible Glove, a cream of some sort that she used to wipe on (did a lot of
print making) before going to work.  Makes whatever lands on your skin come
off a lot easier later.  I haven't tried it yet, she swears it was great
stuff.

Anybody else remember a post from someone who said that gasoline goes
straight through your skin into the bloodstream?  If that's true it's a
wonder I don't explode walking past smokers.  Do petroleum and similar
solvents make it through the latex at all?  What about the old oil and
rubber problem?
