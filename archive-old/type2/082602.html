&gt; Jason and list,
&gt; ...&quot;air from the lower regesters

&gt;     Same thing happens in our '71 with stock heating system in good shape.

i concur that the same happens in my '71 with stock heating system, HOWEVER,
I have also noticed the effects of what I can only assume is natural
convection occuring in my bus as well.  As I drive down the road with the
heat on full bore (which is still not that much), if I reach down
in between the front seats, I can feel a cool breeze coming from the back 
of the bus.  

I assume that this is the result of the heat rising from the front and 
circulating towards the rear of the bus, hence pushing cold air forward,
although that might be a stretch and maybe I just have another air leak
somewhere.  That said, if there's a cool breeze coming from between the
seats, then it's going to seem like you're only getting heat on the
other foot...

thoughts?
