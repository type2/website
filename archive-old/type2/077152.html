Subject: Re: [T2] Audi/Vanagon seats in a '74?

&gt;Guys, not having been in a vanagon lately, why would
&gt;I want a seat out of one of them to go in to my 78?
&gt;
&gt;There must be something I am missing here....
&gt;Are they really made that much better than the stock seat?

Besides the arm rests, they're significantly more comfortable.

They won't go right into a '72, though, I can tell you that.
