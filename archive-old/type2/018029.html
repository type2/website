Subject: Pop top - painting &amp; Al powder
Message-ID: &lt;373DBAB7.5505_at_ibm_dot_net&gt;

Hey all,
I have begun the painting process on my pop top - 76 westy

Some folks suggested washing &amp; waxing it, but the top's outer coat had
already degraded.
There was fuzz everywhere, and on the back corners, you could see lines
in the top that loooked like fiber mats (if that's the way they were
made)

So,
I read Bob Hoover's &quot;Forever Pop top&quot; a long time ago.  I have been
looking for Al powder EVERYWHERE!
I have called all of the paint stores in the area, boat/marine stores,
hardware stores, even looked it up in a chemical catalog ($$$$).

I have heard of adding metal to the paint that goes onto the bottom of
boats, but I could not find any powder anywhere (even at the beach -more
boats)

I was going to add it to the primer and then paint, and top coat, like
Hoover's article.

After a year of on and off looking (and my top looking worse and worse)
I decided to use some marine fiberglass topside paint.  I spoke w/
another list member, and he stated that is what he did and he's real
happy w/ the results.  (Besides, I was reading the &quot;Monkey Wrench Gang&quot;
and Al powder was one of the components that they used in making some
explosives - I could see it now &quot;No Mr FBI, I swear it was for my pop
top!&quot;)

I powerwashed the top at a local carwash, then waited for it to dry.
Then I sanded it w/ an electric palm sander and a med/lite grade paper. 
I hand sanded the hard to get to places and never gouged the
fiberglass.  I just wanted to get the grunge off of the exterior.

I removed all of the bolts with the exception of the hinge bolts in
back.  Be exteremely careful of raising the top w/ the extesion arms
bolts out.  They are spring loaded and under a lot off force.  

I pulled off the luggage rack section of the top, removed the seal from
the entire top, except the part that goes between the top and the
luggage rack since it is glued on.  I put plastic sheeting beteen the
top and the bus to prevent paint drips.  Then I laid the luggage rack
back on top w/ it's front hanging off the front of the bus a couple of
inches so that I could paint the back of the luggage rack as well.

I bought 1 qt of Marine Topside semi-gloss white (I will need 2 qts _at_
$15/qt).  It contains polyurethane, and is pretty thick.  The paint is
designed to be used on the topside of fiberglass boats exposed to the
sun, ocean conditions, and people walking on it all day.  According to
it's label, it has excellent UV barriers in it.

A regular paint brush worked well.  I painted the top from the center
out to the edge, then the sides from the front to back in pretty even
strokes.  you can still see the brush marks after one coat.

I painted the metal bracket that sits on the top center w/ silver spray
paint after I sanded and rust coated it. and I will get all new
galvanized or stainless bolts to prevent rust streaks.  I may paint over
these bolts as well.

I am already extremely pleased, there is still some fuzz sticking out
and the finish is kind of rough right now.

I only have one coat on now, but int he next week - weather permitting-
I will rewash (regular wash w/ cloth) and perform a light wet-sand. 
Then I will put a second coat on, and see how it looks/feels.  If
necessary, I'll repeat the procedures and put a 3rd coat on.  i'll let
you know how it comes out.

Anyone had any ideas on the sitting position of the top? I posted last
week that the corners of my top squish the body in the back.  PM if you
have the same.
