Subject: Fuel pump for 69 

James L. McGill asks:

Do you have to pull the engine to get to the fuel pump (particularly
on a '69) ((no I have look myself even though I spend a lot of time 
under the bus))

What would have to happen in order to get a fuel line guaranteed
not to ever explode the bus, killing me and my family and everybody 
the the cars around us?  How can I inspect this?



        James,
        Just open the hatch. You'll see the carb, and leading to it
a black (probably) fuel line. The other end of that line goes to the
fuel pump, and then a second line goes from there to a hard metal line.
The hard metal line (steel) goes through a grommet in the front tin
(FIF) and there to a flexable line that may or may not connect 
to a filter and then to the tank. 
        All you can see from under the bus is the tank, flexable line,
filter if any, flex-to-hard-line- connection.
        DO inspect the grommet the hard line goes through. DO inspect
the hoses for cracking, stiffness. DO check the hoses from the hard
line to pump, from pump to carb.
        Many conservative persons recomend NOT having a filter between
the pump and carb. They suggest filter on the output of the tank only.
MANY vw persons such as myself have a filter between the pump and carb.
        Problem is wieght of filter, over time, may pull brass hose-barb
from carb body, big fuel leak, fire, etc.

        Moral: Inspect this stuff and PULL ON IT to make sure it's
all tight, nothing is being rubbed-through, etc. Grommets and hard pipes
are $1-$3 items at most aftermarked VW places.

        DO NOTE that there is a filter screen in the pump somewhere.

        I don't think a replacable fuel filter becomes a factory part
until Type IV engines, maybe not until electric fuel pumps and FI.

        Because the engine is mounted separately from the body,
the fuel tank and engine seldom even vibrate the same. You can therefore
imagine why its not possible to connect one pipe which will last forever.
Bummer. 

        Bob Hoover makes elaborate super-grommet/pass-throughs
to replace the hard tube and gromet most of us have. He points out
that the original factory specs listed the front tin grommet as
an inspect-every-3000-miles item. Bob's super-grommet is a piece
of threaded tubing (from lamp shop) secured to front tin with
RTV glopped around and washers and nuts holding it securly.
        A piece of hard fuel hose 2 inches longer than the threaded
pipe is secured within the threaded tube using more RTV. It floats
on the rtv mounts, not a thin grommet, certainly no metal-metal contact.
        correct rubber hoses, with clamps, lead from the tank/filter
to the input side of this (front, FIF) and a similar hose leads
from it back to the fuel pump.

        Cheers!
        Bill
