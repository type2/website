Subject: RE: [T2] Friday Content: &quot;Bus smashing&quot;

&gt;Has anyone seen that yellow/orange bus getting smashed in the new Hulk
&gt;movie? What was the director thinking?

The bus doesn't get smashed at all.  It is still there when the Hulk ends
his tirade around San Francisco.  I thought that Ang Lee was pretty cool for
choosing a bay window bus to show like that in the movie and even cooler for
not destroying it.  Maybe the Hulk is a bus fan?
