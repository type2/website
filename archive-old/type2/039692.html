&lt;&lt; When I was carpeting the seat stands I took the opportunity to leave a
 little something for someone to find when this bus gets restored again
 10 or 15 years from now, either by me or someone else.

I did this several years ago behind the dash of my '74  Super Cabrio.  Left 
my name and date plus a few other things on the tag behind the glove box 
area.  It's long gone now.
If anyone comes across it, holler!
