Subject: 82 Type IV Block--cheap!
Date: Tue, 9 Jan 2001 21:06:25 -0800
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I have an type IV engine block out of an 82 Westy that is in need of a
rebuild because of a burned number 3 piston and cyclinder.  The bottom end
was still in good shape when the piston gave up, and the motor as a whole
got me home after it went (120+ miles).  Have the intake runners, air
distribution box, FI wiring etc.  It's been sitting for a bit......outside,
but  whats there is going, one way or the other.  I'm keeping the heads and
extra tin though.

Best offer or, if all else fails, free for the taking!  I live in the
Renton - Issaquah area of Washington state.  I could deliver it to the
greater Seattle - Bellevue area for a fee.

Please email skjeflo_at_home_dot_com with questions or if interested.

P.S.  No, I won't bother to ship it!
