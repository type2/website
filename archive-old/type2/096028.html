Subject: won't start still - help!

'79 cal engine.

changed fuel lines, pulling injectors and 3/4 runner in the process. replaced all, now won't start. performed double relay test procedure per bentley with meter instead of test light.

1. only getting 4-6vdc _at_ fuel pump, do I need 12vdc?
   the pressure gauge only goes up to 10psi unless I
   connect the pump to a known 12v source, then I get
   32psi. Will this keep the bus from starting?

2. I only show 8vdc at terminal 15 at the coil.
   Is this why I'm not getting 12vdc _at_ pump?
   This wire to coil comes from the ignition switch
   yes? Maybe I just have too much resistance there.

3. Apparently I have fuel pump wires switched from
   terminals 30/50 at the solenoid, but I can't
   tell which terminals are which on the solenoid.
   The battery cable goes to 50, but which of the
   little pins (I have 3, 2 top, one bottom) is 30?

4. I think I'm sucking air, she'll catch now, but die
   immediately. I've tried to tighten all the air
   lines, what's the check?

5. I had a backfire doing this, blew off the brake
   booster hose connect at intake manifold. 

enough for now, thanks y'all. I really am doing my best with the bentley, meter and pressure gauge, but I'm hurting now. It's been three days in the sun and a burned vacation day today, but I will press on.

Later,

Billy
