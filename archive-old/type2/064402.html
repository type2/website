Subject: blown 15A fuse on ignition relay? [was: ugly breakdown]

Greetings all:

Back to the story of the abrupt engine failure after putting in the Bosch
WR-1 relay kit.  [Thanks to Steve, Jim, Ron, Sean, Rick, and Martin, all
of whom checked in with condolences and advice.]

I have here beside me the blown 15A fuse that was linked into the Bosch 
kit.  

I checked all connections with my fingers before I got back out from under
the bus, and everything seems tight and undamaged.  With the Bosch kit,
there's really not much opportunity for incorrect assembly--most links
only fit one way in one place anyway. 

I figure that means I've got two problems: the fuse and whatever blew it. 
Since I've got some of every kind of fuse *except* this one laying around
[had bags of them in my Honda which was stolen for the second and final
time last spring, but don't get me started], work has stopped for awhile
anyway, giving me time to ponder. 

Several people suggested that the problem might be in the coil, condenser
and points, or the electronic fuel cutoff.  I delayed checking them until
I'd at least eyeballed the relay assembly; when I found the fuse, my first
guess was that they weren't the culprits this time. It feels like it would
be quite a coincidence if the relay kit didn't have something to do with
it, something more than signalling the problem with the blown fuse. On the
other hand, *something* took my engine out pretty abruptly.  [Recap: it
abruptly died in traffic, I coasted to a place of almost-complete lack of
safety, tried popping the clutch, then cranked it a couple of times, and
at first it seemed almost to catch, then it simply clicked, then nothing.]
So perhaps what happened was that the Real Problem cut out the engine, and
the fuse went while trying to restart it? 

Thanks in advance for any advice.  I'm going to go back out and check the
fuel cut-off, etc. 

uneasily,
Bill
