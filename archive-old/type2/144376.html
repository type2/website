Its on the Chicago Commodities Board, actually. Last time I looked a
couple of months ago, Yellow Grease was selling at $.17/gal. Of course,
this is dried and filtered, so the actual waste oil is practically free
even on the commodities market. Still, its hard to imagine the delivery
scenario in front of my house.

bus content:
2nd camping trip of the season went great (Silver Falls SP). driver's
side flasher went batty - stopped flashing whenever I stepped hard
enough on the brake to light the lamps. Found LH signal housing ground
to body was not complete. cleaned, re-attached. now blinking normally.
canvas top got torn even more. will have to patch it, as replacement is
a year+ away according to the plan. still getting over 20mpg.
