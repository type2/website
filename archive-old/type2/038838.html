Subject: Three Choices...Help?

For those who remember my disaster last week and the subsequent firestorm I 
created with my initial posting, I'll tell you where I am and ask some advice 
on which way to turn. The details of the problems with the other engine will 
remain between the mechanic, the seller, and me, but here's the deal.
Option 1. Rebuild existing 1600 upright- estimate $1572.00
Option 2. Buy already rebuilt 1600 (I think he called it a short block, so 
would someone explain why its called that?) for  $1760.00
Option 3. Install brand new (long block?) for $1650.00
My questions are:
Why would I do a rebuild by them which is the longest time in the shop,(and 
remember I only drove my new toy 80 miles before disaster) if I can come up 
with a couple hundred more dolllars and have a new one installed? The only 
reason I can come up with would be originality, but I found out from mechanic 
that this engine was a '71 in a '70 anyway.
How can a new engine be a hundred bucks or so cheaper than a rebuild, and so 
why would I buy a rebuild? He said something about it possibly being the 
exchange rate because the total rebuild comes from overseas. I guess this is 
possible.
Are there different makes of &quot;new engines&quot; and if so, should I post the 
brand(assuming that's the way to go) so I can get some feedback on brand?
I can pack a lot of questions into one posting can't I? Please feel free to 
comment on all or none, and thanks again for helping a newbie on a &quot;major but 
determined uphill learning curve&quot;!
