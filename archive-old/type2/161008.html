&gt; hello Richard  I am thinking this is outdated. the new gas we are  
&gt; seeing now doesn't last 6 months. It has gotten real bad.

How &quot;well&quot; does the engine run with that gas?

&gt; I tend to add stablizer to mine that sit over winter.  When we get  
&gt; bad gas here at the shop we drain it and put it in the Grasshopper 
&gt; (63 single cab work truck)  it is kinda like Mikey it will eat  
&gt; anything.

:-)

&gt; some of the stuff it runs on stinks so bad you can't stand behind  
&gt; it for long

I've never forget that smell. It's sickly sweet.
