Subject: [T2] Vacuum Readings


&gt; I have just checked the vacuum reading at idle on my 78' 2.0 Fi and got
&gt; 12-13&quot;. That seems a little low and so I am going to put hose clamps on
all
&gt; of the vacuum lines that I can including the 4 intake runner tubes. I seem
&gt; to detect a hissing sound that could be leak but as of yet have not
located
&gt; it, will try with carb cleaner.

Since air is moving all around the engine a hissing sound isn't uncommon and
doesn't necessarily indicate a vacuum leak.  I've never been a big fan of
spraying combustible material on a running engine.  I manually inspect all
big hoses and then pressurize the system and check for leaks with a little
soapy water.

&gt; Can the intake runner hose sections from
&gt; the plenum to the manifold be relplaced without removing the intake
&gt; manifolds?

No.

&gt; Also has anyone found a replacement for the little elbow from
&gt; the aux air regulator?

Bus Depot's site says they have it.
