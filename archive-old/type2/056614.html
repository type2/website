Subject: howling noise under torque

I just got my '71 Westfalia back from the restorers, and 
took it camping for the *first time* this year.  I do 
remember it being loud, but on this trip (Highlands
Bus Festival-Grandfather Mountain) I noticed that there 
is a loud drone (howl) that seems to be transmitted to 
the body when the drive train is under torque. It seems 
independent of the usual interior engine noise.  The 
engine is fresh, and the van has 120,000 actual miles.  
Does anyone remember if they sounded like that when 
they were new?  Is this common?  20 years ago, I had 
a '71 bug and it had the same drive train noise for years
(when it was under torque). A person who seemed 
knowledgeable at the time said that  &quot;he believed&quot; the 
noise was due to a worn bearing in the transaxle. Could 
there be any truth to that? I haven't looked at the 
mounting points yet, but I'm wondering if a rubber 
bushing may be worn (or missing) instead.  Have any 
of you had your transaxle rebuilt, and did you notice if 
that made a difference in interior drive train noise in
while in 3rd and 4th?
v
I'm in the process of putting stick-on sound deadening 
pads in all door and side panels.  The top rear corners 
next to the rear hatch doors seem to be the worst 
offenders.  They are passive radiators from the engine
compartment.  I don't expect it to sound like a Eurovan,
but I do plan to treat interior noise as aggressively as 
possible one-decibel-at-a-time.  If that drive train *drone*
is solvable, I think that would knock off 40 (many) 
decibels in one step.
