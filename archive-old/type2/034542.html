page 134  re. case torque change
&quot;as of 1/87 we have been testing cases with increased torque on the 6
center main bearing nuts on ALL high performance engines.  this has
provided great improvement to case life.  first, &quot;NEVER&quot; use the read
sealing nuts with the seal down.  we use the flat washer and the 19 mm
wrench size nuts, which we can supply.  when you use the read seal
nuts, install them with the red side up away from the washer.  the
o'rings in the case at the stud will seal the case properly against
leakage.  with this combination we increase the torque on STREET
application engines up into the 6000-7500 rpm range to 29-30 lbs. and
on all out RACE applications or over 7500 rpm to 33-34lbs.&quot;
