  If you are talking about the Tom Wilson book on rebuilding the VW engine,
  yes it covers the Type IV for buses and the Porsche 914.

  New Text Item:  Text Item
There have been a fair number of notes re the engine repair book.  Would
that book cover the Type IV engine.. the pancake?  I just retreived the
wayward engine of the 72 westy that I bought last week and I have to
admit I'm confounded by all the wires that are on it as well as the wires
that are missing.  It sounds like that book could be the one for me.

I have a billion other questions... here's one more.  Would a 73
Westy motor fit in my 72 westy?

Please and thank you in advance...
