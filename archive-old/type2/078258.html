Subject: Re: [T2] rear hatch window installation

thanks for the replys everyone. i guess i should have been more descriptive
on my initial post.

suggestions that came up but that i had already tried:
-get the seal warm
-have another person help from the outside

suggestions that i have not tried yet:
-silicone spray on the seal
-starting on the bottom edge of the window is easier
as far as 'wire', actually i used some speaker wire split in half. i dont
know the guage but its not that thick. i used the same type of wire for the
other seals i installed a few years ago on a 73 super beetle &amp; it worked
pefectly.

thanks again &amp; keep the suggestions coming.

its supposed to be really warm tomorrow so i think i'll leave it in the sun
all day &amp; give it a go when i get home from work tomorrow.
