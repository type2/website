just in case anyone else wondered...

clark asked:
&gt; &gt;If there is some sort of lifter/case realtionship that needs to be
maintained,
&gt; &gt;couldn't you just polish the lifter (like a crank gets polished for new
&gt; &gt;bearings or a cylinder gets honed for new rings) so the lifter will wear a
&gt; &gt;'new' surface into the lifter bore?

 I can't see how the lifter/bore relationship could be important, and I have
violated it more than once.  I think it (wilson saying put old lifters back
where they came from) is simply to maintain the
lifter-cam relationship.
