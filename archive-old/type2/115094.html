&gt; Do any of the tail light assemblies come with the &quot;reflector&quot; areas around
&gt; the bulbs in the housings chromed or silvered?  I'm not referring to the

The originals didn't and I've not seen a replacement that did. Beetle tail
light housings were reflective like that at least with the late model
elephant foot style.

The 72-79 tail lights are really great especially when you've got new bulbs
and a set of lenses that haven't clouded.

I get a real kick out of seeing old beetles drive down the freeway at night.
You can barely see the tail lights and they pass you long before you notice
the warm yellow glow from the headlights. 6v bugs even more so.
