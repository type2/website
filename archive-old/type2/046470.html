Subject: [T2] muffler install tip

here is a quck tip on installing a muffler on a 73 - 74 with a pancake
engine.
pop the engine hatch and remove the two pieces of upper tin on the
left and right sides, this allows you to get to the two top nuts
that hold the muffler on to the heat exchangers. I put a new exhaust
on my bus about two years ago and it took me about 2 hours
because it was harder then hell to get that 13mm onto those
top botls.
The other day I put on new muffler gaskets, I took of the two pieces of tin 
and had the job complete in about 20 min.

enjoy
