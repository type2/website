Subject: fuel pump actuator lever pin removed..

Well I figured it out. The &quot;pin&quot; that the acuator
lever
rides on is threaded at the slotted head end and the
end
of the pin simply rests in a cup on the other side.
Very fine threads.
  I put the lower part of the pump in my vise which
depressed the diaphragm's plunger. This took the
tension
off the lever which in turn made the pin easier to
turn ( I had not wanted to force it before). Once
turned all the way the pin slides out easily. The
lever arm has to
be &quot;rocked&quot; all the way flush with the flange then
worked out with a pencil through the pin hole. This
disengages
the lever arm from the diaphragm's plunger. Pretty
cruddy
so it took some work just due to the hardened sludge.
Once the lever arm is out then the plunger can be slid
out... now where the hell did that spring go!? ;-)

ignorance is bliss!
