I believe they go back to 2003 but they didn't take effect until your area upgraded to dyno testing. It's not fair they are making the test harder to pass for older vehicles that have stock configuration.

&gt;We 
&gt;bought a new Passat in April, and a couple of months prior to that had 
&gt;our outgoing Honda Accord smog'd, and they definitely ran it on the 
&gt;dyno.

Back in 2002 the smog ref tested my wife's car on the dyno when we moved to the state.
