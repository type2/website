Hi all,

Just a comment about the new format of the digest list.  When I first
saw the new format I noted that it came with files attached.  My first
reaction was that somebody was passing along that Melissa virus that we
are hearing so much about from our network administrators at work.  I
now know that the attachments won't affect my machine, but it did give
me quite a scare.  I vote for the old format when the the administrator
gets finished with his upgrades.  It's hard to pass along viruses in
plain ascii format.  Just my 2 cents worth.

Mandatory bus content:  Just made a trip to Saint Johnsbury Vt. over the
past weekend and spotted a very fine '71 panel 'loaf.  I wooda waved but
he was in front of me. I wonder if the owner is a member of the list.  A
'71 in as good as condition as that was is a real rarity in the
northeast.  Like to meet the guy.  Anyway, I could tell that it was a
'71 'cause it had VT plates on it that said &quot;71 VW&quot;.....
