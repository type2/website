Subject: Re: Hoisting Type 4 engine?

  Got a couple of replies with some info, thanks. Let me give a bit more
  detail.

  Have to lift up into high pickup bed.  I could lift one side no problem
  but friend is 115lb and no muscle, had trouble helping me lift a Type 1
  up on engine stand. Only us two available so hoist is it.

  I'll have to look more into the actual mechanics of dropping a T4 bus
  engine out of a wrecking yard bus, got one description of doing this.
  Problem is, the wrecking yard has hoists available since also have lots
  of US pull em up and out engines in cars. I walk in with a tool bag. Much
  harder to haul in ramps or platforms, etc, plus it's a large yard. Might
  be able to scrounge car parts laying around to get a jack up high enough
  to support an end.  Might be able to prop up tranny end and get a cable
  past tin to go around flywheel area to hook to hoist.  I'm just not as
  familiar with busses.  What would be about the center point of balance
  for a T4 engine and tranny, say around a 78 FI?

  Thanks again,
  Jeff
