still trying to figure this engine out.  today i did more and more checking, 
starting from the bottom up and testing stuff out.  here's the basics:  
checked compression in all cylinders, all were between 120-140 so that's 
cool.  checked timing statically(don't have a gun yet) and its right on.  
dwell is at 50.  i fixed all the vaccum areas that i thought were in 
question and i don't hear any major air noises anymore (although there is a 
nice flow of air coming out of my #2 cylinder hole??).
so i thought that maybe there was a miss somewhere ignition system, so i 
started the engine and pulled one spark plug wire out at a time to see if 
there was a miss anywhere.  the result was baffling, as removing the wire 
did absolutely nothing to the running performance of the engine (maybe a 
very very slight drop in rpm, but i would expect that removing a wire would 
make a rather drastic change in idle).

so that's what i did.   here's the symptoms as of now:  engine starts up 
easily but idles rough (almost as if missfiring?),  there is lots of smoke 
that smells like gas, the oil is gassy and reaks of gas, and the plugs were 
ALL black with carbon.

so she's running rich.  i don't know what to check now.  or what might be 
wrong.

and i found the decelleration valve and egr, it appears my egr is not hooked 
up as there are no hoses or vaccum to it....

what are the major causes of running this rich?  i'm almost there...i can 
see the light at the end of the tunnel.......

mark, '78 fi bus.
