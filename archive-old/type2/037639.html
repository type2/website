Melissa,

You can find nomenclature info at VW planet under type 2 Information and Model Numbers or these locations.

I saw another comprehensive list the other day but can't seem to find the link now.  I personally have named mine &quot;Kombie&quot;  just to be cute and confusing.  My friends don't usually distinguish between a vanagon and a &quot;bus&quot; so it is irrelevant.

'78 two-tone &quot;kombie&quot;
