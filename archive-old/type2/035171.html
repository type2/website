Subject: Reality - goodbye and some questions

Well everyone, due to decreased money and moving, my project must go. Small
apartment, one parking space, two cars and two projects comes out to a big
ol dose of everything must go. Well almost everything. A friend of my
brother is living in his 77 transporter, which is rather cramped as you
might imagine. At just the right time he offered me $300 for my 72 mystery
camper (no engine) in two weeks. I hate to let it go just like that but hey
I need the cash. 

So aside from saying goodbye (till I get another bus somewhere down the
line) I have a couple questions. His is a '77 - 2L - and mine is a '72 -
1.7L. From what I understand, my tranny is geared lower, right? Aside from
engine sizes and carb vs FI, what are the major differences? I mean, what
will he have to change to make the swap? If he'd rather keep his tranny, is
there much to do to to make it fit in the 72? 

I'm crying about losing my dream camper, but I can't afford to do this till
I get a decent job and a place to work on it. Thanks for all the help and
education! 

JT
