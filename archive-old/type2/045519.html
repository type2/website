Ohmigosh, Dave,

My brain must have slipped a cog!!!  It is an ED. (which the rebuild manual 
sez is a 2.0 L. Wonder how long that mistake has persisted?  :-)

Thanks for the shout.

Cheers/Carron

in 
&gt; my '71.... AE engines were used in bugs and busses.

&gt;  CB is the code for a 1700 engine, AW for a 1800.... possible typo?  or  
else,  ya gots an engine different that somebody told ya.
