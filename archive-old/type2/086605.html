Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel sensor accessability


There was a post earlier today in which a person described lowering the
engine some and removing the tank that way. I guess if you have FI you
could do it but honestly pulling the motor is not that big of a deal. On my
78' I leave the trans bolted to the motor and just pop the front trans
mount, mustache bar, and rear trans hangers, a few wires, clutch and accel
cable, and a fuel line and carefully lower the whole shebang on a floor
jack. Install is much easier this way as you dont have to wiggle and push
to get the input shaft into the tranny...
     I bet there are othe rthings you would love to take care of while that
motor is out anyway. Easily done in a weekend.

&gt;Andrew,
&gt;I also live about 12 miles from town, and I have the same model fuel
guage:
&gt;reads well when tank is full but after 30 miles it reads empty. I am
waiting
&gt;to fix it until I have to remove the engine anyway. In the mean time, I
have
&gt;a post-it note on the dash on which I write down the mileage for the next
&gt;fill-up. To be on the safe side, I fill after 150 miles (250km?) even
though
&gt;I get more miles than that out of a tank of gas.

Initially I did the same, except I used one of those little plastic mileage

indicators with the moveable dials so you can set it to any mileage.  Got
it at Poop Boys for a few dollars.  You could also do what I did later -
install a Vanagon speedo and use the trip meter.  :-)  I can almost
guarantee you that your sender is bad as my symptoms were identical to
yours.  I've heard that it's possible to swap out the sender with the tank
in place, without cutting through the floor!  If you're a contortionist
maybe?  Not tried it though.  I removed my tank while the engine was out
for a rebuild (and even then it was a dirty, PITA job).

&gt;Just yesterday I filled up
&gt;after pushing the mileage limits a bit. The book says that the tank holds
&gt;14.8 gallons but the fuel pump registered 14.9! I guess I cut that one a
&gt;little close.

I've put as much as 15.2 gallons in without running out, but I fill it
until the fuel level is 2&quot; below the cap.  I have to put the last 2 gallons

or so in very slowly.


&gt;Anyway, just set yourself a reasonable mileage range between fill-ups and
&gt;fix the sender when you have the engine out for other work.

I think that's a great idea!
