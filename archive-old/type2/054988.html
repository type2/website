Subject: (relative) success. '78 Idle problems

Volks,

First, thanks to all of you who responded to my previous post.  Second, I
have achieved a measure of success in my quest to pass VA emissions
inspection.  The bus will finally return to idle, mostly. 

Today was the first day that I really had a whole day to devote to the
bus.  First things first, I rechecked the dwell and timing (see my post on
why it wouldn't idle *at all* last week :-)  Found that the timing was
still a hair off (5 BTDC) and reset it. This was because I had bought and
applied a dot of the most *garish* pink fingernail polish during the week
this week and didn't have to depend on my imagination to find the timing
mark :-)  

With all the ignition checking out fine, I applied the vacuum guage and
found that i had 8&quot; of vacuum at idle, which is *WAY* low. Normal for me
for VW's is ~14-15&quot;.  I had suspected this and had ordered up new boots
for the intake runners and new runner to head gaskets as well. Alas, the
gaskets were in, but the boots were not :-( Sooo... I did the rest of the
vac check and passed on the obvious source of leaks (which is dumb, but I
had no choice :-( I removed and plugged both of the large ports on the
distribution box (for the brake booster and the aix air valve).  Vacuum
rose to 12&quot;!  plugged the disk brake booster back in, capped the decel
valve port. Still at 12&quot;.  Plugged in the decel valve and we are back to
11-10&quot;.  Replaced the decel Valve.  Karl von Salzen had given me a test
for the decel valve that it had failed last week so I had ordered a
replacement.  Plugged that in and vac is at 12&quot;.  So the other 2&quot; are
disappearing in the aux air valve....  alas, I don't have another aux air
valve... but! the aux air valve is for cold weather starting!!!  and it is
90+ here and likely to be thru the end of July (by which I *have* to have
passed emissions!  So.... I carve the plug to the point that I can slip
the hose over the cork (got to pass that visual too :-) and seal it up. I
will order a replacement aux air valve this week (if I can :-)

At this point I adjust the idle to ~800, rev it to 2500 and hold it for 15
seconds.  Idle returns to &lt; 900 within 10 seconds!!!  YAY!!!  This is
still not perfect, and I still want to have those intake runners off and
try to get the vacuum up to at least 14&quot;, but I think I have a shot now at
passing emissions.

One of the &quot;catch 22's&quot; of VA emissions is that if the car will not idle
correctly, they cannot conduct the test, which means that you can't get a
waiver :-(  Now I can at least fail and start spending in search of a
waiver :-)

And tomorrow, I start in on the &quot;safety&quot; failure items...  Wipers (a
doddle), defrost (uhoh :-(, and horn (OH, NO, MR. BILL!!!!)  I will wait
until it is &quot;legal&quot; to make it actually safe and drivable... by replacing
the absolutely *dangerous* front ball joints!!! (I still can't believe
that they passed and that the silly-ass wipers and defrost didn't...
what priorities!)
