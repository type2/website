        No, no, don't do that -- changing out an ignition switch is a real
PITA, and 10 to 1 that isn't your problem. The problem is the starter --
it's drawing too much current. If you are really, really lucky, you'll find
a unused connector on the starter solinoid that can be used for send extra
current to the coil during starting.  Take a look under there at the
connections, and while it's running, put a voltmeter on any unused connector
and if there's no voltage while the engine is running, but is while it's
cranking, that's the one. Not all starters have them tho.
        But most likely you're going to have to rebuild the starter. It's
easy. Maybe you only need to clean up the commutator with a strip on
sandpaper (not emery paper, sandpaper) and then clean out each groove with a
broken hacksaw blade, or screwdriver tip, or ?? But even if you have to put
in new brushes it's not that hard. Make sure to put a dab of grease in the
grease pocket at the closed end, and another dab in the bushing in the
bellhousing.
       If you're really unlucky, you'll have to replace the bushing in the
bellhousing.
