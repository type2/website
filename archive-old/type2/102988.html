Subject: fuel cutoff solenoid

If you are installing a cutoff solenoid in your fuel
line and are having problems with &quot;trapped pressure&quot;
you might consider controling the solenoid with a time
delay relay. If you can quantify the time required to
allow for pressure stabilization after shutting off
the engine, then you can set the time delay to leave
the solenoid open for that period of time and then
shut off.
Just a thought.
