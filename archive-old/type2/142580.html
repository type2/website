Subject: Re: [T2] need new engine

hey guys   I wouldnt reccommend this swap  the turbo subas have head problems 
The turbo sits right on top of the right head causing overheating of that 
head.  The later subus were also having head gasket problems   In short order I 
think you are swapping one problem for another .  Later and have fun  Mark
