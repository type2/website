Subject: Slamming Jamie's Westy

Jamie's lowered westy features a &quot;shaved&quot; propane tank :-) 
I have some more photchops I have done posted at Vintagebus_dot_com if anyone is
interested.

Where did the propane tank go?  I guess this model is only for camping in
WalMart parking lots :)
Looks like maybe this setup would be a good candidate for height adjustable
airbags?
