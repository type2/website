Subject: Re: [T2] alternate FI controllers

Hi Harry,

There is at least one bus owner on this list running megasquirt on a  
daily driver.

I looked at MS as a replacement for my dual carbs but decided to  
learn FI working with L-Jetronic before I started work on an  
experimental system. I *might* switch Colleen's bus over to MS once  
I've had it on the road for a year or so.


Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt;
&gt; I'm curious if anyone has explored other options of FI controllers for
&gt; their bus?
