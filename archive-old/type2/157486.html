Subject: Swing Lever Bushings

Well, in the process of trying to install new bushings for the swing lever, I messed at least one
of them up.  I could get the swing lever pin through the bottom bushing OK, but it stopped as soon
as it hit the top one.  So in a fit of rage or stupidity or whatever, I pounded the pin upwards
through the top bushing.  I got it through, but scored the bushing.

I pulled the bushings out, and I think I didn't pull the top one in straight, dinging the edge up.

So... the question is, are the bushings available separately?  I don't see them listed alone at
anyplace online.  The part number looks to be 211 405 317B.  

Or do I need to order another Febi kit?

BTW, I pulled the old ones out per the library, 12&quot; of 1/2&quot; all thread with two washers ground
down to just under the size of the bushing.  The second time I found that a 1/2&quot; drive Craftsman
19mm socket was just the right size to pull the bushings, and a 1/2&quot; drive Craftsman 36mm socket
was a good fit on the bottom to pull into.  I'm a little gun shy now after messing up the first
bushings and contemplating renting the tool from Bus-Boys.
