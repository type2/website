Subject: Vacuum advance vacuum lines and two-way cutoff valve

Hello list,

I have been doing some research on how tho install my
vacuum advance distributor system and my dual solex
34SDPIT2&amp;3 carborators.I am trying to figure out what
is needed and what is not needed. I want to go as
stock as possible but without EGR or emmission
control. I am also trying to hook up the vacuum hoses
that go to the vacuum advance distributor. 

&lt;QUESTION&gt;

Is the two-way cutoff valve that is hooked inline with
the vac. can on the distributor carb necessary? Can I
just bypass this valve and hook a vac line straight to
the carb? Will this do any harm? If I do need it,
where is the transmission switch and the temperature
swithch that the two-way switch hooks up to? (I have
an automatic 73 bus by the way)

I would appreciate any help that you might give.

Thanks!
David Kelly
