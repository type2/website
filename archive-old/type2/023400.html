I spoke with Volkswagen Club today and the notified me they extended the time 
to register for the cruise.  Day by Day they say.  For those who are new, it 
starts at Morro Bay Oct 16 ends Oct 16, 80-100 miles later in Solvang.  Some 
will be camping the night before at Morro Dunes.  It is a great chance to 
meet and mingle.  Please feel free to
check it out at www.VW Club_dot_com, or e-mail me.  Lets get off the couch 
Air-cooled Crew
and show why Volkswagen is still in business.  Yep us.
Peace Out
