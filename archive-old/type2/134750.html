Subject: Re: heater (not fresh) air fan? Vanagon upgrade for late bay??

&gt; Yeah but the engine fan pushes some serious air (1700CFM) some of which 
&gt; goes
&gt; through the heating system. How much does the squirrel fan push?
&gt;
&gt;&gt; It would fit roughly where the oil filler tube is now.
&gt;
&gt; Where does that get relocated?
Richard,
The squirrel fan does nothing above idle.  The engine fan takes over after 
that.  By using the vanagon fan pulley on the alternator (which is smaller 
and so it turns about two times for every one time the engine fan turns and 
they turn with the same belt)  This is stock on the air-cooled vanagon. So 
if the engine fan is pushing 1700 CFM then the smaller pulley fan would push 
about 3400 CFM.  For those that complain they don't have the power they want 
from their heating system, this would help immensely.

As for where the oil filler tube might go.  I am unsure if it would have to 
move (the reason  I was asking if anyone had tried it)  The air-cooled 
vanagon engine is basically the same as a bay pancake engine, so how does 
the oil filler go on a vanagon?
