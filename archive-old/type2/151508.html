X-Virus-Scanned: Symantec AntiVirus Scan Engine
Subject: RE: [T2] Another engine goes Boom!

&gt;&gt;&gt; My dillema
- Do I bite the bullet and have him build me an engine
($1500)  or do I take him a questionable Beetle motor
-1600 DP I have sitting in my garage (I know it ran
but have never had it installed in a bus) Or do I cut
my losses ($2000 into the vehicle including new tires
and power brakes) and get what I can out of the shell?
 The camper is complete with everything except the
side tent and needs a new canvas in the pop top.  No
real rust to speak of or any body damage.  Original
Paint etc...
Any advice would be appreciated.
&lt;&lt;&lt;

put the spare motor in it &amp; go. sounds like you have a really nice shell to
work with.

have fun,

Joel
