Subject: my bus spoke to me for the first time...

I'm sure something like this has happened to some of you too, but I thought
I'd share...

My '79 Westy had been sitting for almost 8 months until I could afford to get
it running right.  She had seen two mechanics that had no idea what was wrong
until I took her to a &quot;specialist&quot; (Lehman's outside Pottstown, PA).

These guys were great and she was running like a champ.  THe first weekend I
had after I got her back I spent all day detailing her....multiple washes,
clay bar, waxing and a heavy duty cleaning to the top....

ANYWAY...she's gleaming in the sun and I'm excited to get her out on the road
the next morning.  I start her up and BLAH.  Running like crap again...no
power...had a hard time getting her to hold 55 on level ground let alone the
hills.  I get to work with no time to pop the hatch to check her out.  After
stewing all day at work I go out, take off my tie and walk around back.  As I
try to open the hatch, the license plate falls off in my hands.  I took it off
to wax and i didn't tighten it except by hand when i put it back on....my
fault.  I secure it with some wire, and pop the hatch.  Everything looks
kosher.  I start her up and she's running smoothly!

It was like she did it just to get me to walk around back and get the license
plate before i lost it for good.  And she's been running fine all week since.

I love my Westy.

Rob
