&gt; I don't know if it is a sign that something on it is going to blow up, or

Sounds like the engine's a tad hot...Next time you drive it try the &quot;dip-
stick temperature indicator&quot;...You should be able to hold the dipstick
in your hand...hot, but holdable...Is the distributor set correct? Even
a little too much advance will over heat the engine... ;-(
