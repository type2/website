Subject: Re: [T2] Just want to die with my (cv) boots on

&gt; Replacing my cv boots (1974) with the German kit from Bus Depot and I

&gt; that was months ago.

The way I do it is to use electrical tape and cover the spline and &quot;step&quot;
with electrical tape, using the tape to &quot;ease&quot; the transition over the
step.  Start wrapping on the high side of the step and work toward the end
of the axle, covering about half the width of the previous wrap with each
turn.  Grease it up and slide the boot over the taped surface.

If you're replacing both boots, you can slide both boots on from the same
side.  No need to tape both ends.
