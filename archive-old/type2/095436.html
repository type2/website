Subject: Re: [T2] FI Confusion

Thanks Dave

That is a little tricky but it sure qualifies as a vacuum leak that could 
cause a air/fuel rich condition.  Breaking the vacuum line to the regulator 
would cause the fuel manifold pressure to rise to its maximum value. Its not 
likely that an open vacuum line that size would push the air manifold up to 
ambient pressure.

I will try and remember this one. Black smoke and a whistling noise? Propane 
into the intake causes engine to die? Check the fuel pressure regulator 
vacuum line.

That line is daisy chained to some other items like the dump valve and my 
cruse control. Disconnects anywhere could cause the problem.

&gt;Chuck,
&gt;
&gt;Wasn't me that said it....
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I can't imagine how *any* vacuum lea....wups...just realized how.
&gt;
&gt;THe only way that I can think of that a vacum leak might make you run
&gt;rich is this...and it's really a reach.....
&gt;
&gt;The vacuum hose to the pressure regulator would have a leak...this might
&gt;make the pressure regulator believe that it was seeing  not much
&gt;vacuum(like wide open throttle) and boost the pressure in the fuel ring a
&gt;little.
&gt;
&gt;Don't know if the  vacuum leak would make up for any difference in the
&gt;fuel ring pressure added &quot;richness&quot; though.  They might actually balance
&gt;out.
&gt;
&gt;Cheers, dave
&gt;
