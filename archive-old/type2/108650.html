Subject: Re: [T2] Frozen hosen (brakes)

You can &quot;talk&quot; them into coming off, if you do it nice and slow and use a
little bit of Zen in your method.
Soak them with some good penetrant.. two applications should do the job. Use
tubing wrenches if you can get them. Otherwise, be sure to use two good,
properly-fitting wrenches at all times anyway so that you don't break or
twist your brake line. You can sort of slowly work them back and forth, a
little at first and eventually increasing your movement and force,
concentrating and feeling as you go, really taking your time. A little bit
of force clockwise is not counterproductive.. Even though you are
technically turning the fitting in harder, this will really help to break up
the rust. Patience is the key, and really tuning in to what you're doing.
