Subject: Re: [T2] Broke Down

im clueless on the dust situation perhaps it was a
fluke thing.

But the rumblings, have you checked your pully? my
thoughts is your pully is broke and ready to crumble.

OTOH, perhaps the smoke screne was just a cover up for
a major conspiracy including you and your bus, and a
plot to sabatage the air cooled enthusiast :8)

peace,
