Subject: [T2] Keeping cool.

Hello type2 listers,

I was wondering if anybody has had experience with 12V swamp coolers or air
conditioners. I live in Tucson AZ, and believe me it is very HOT down here.
I have been looking at getting some kind of cooling system for the interior
of my '77 Custom Conversion Camper. 

&lt;ENDLESS DESCRIPTION alt=&quot;Skip to the next paragraph, where the real
question is.&quot;&gt; 
It is Martini Olive Green with a white pop-top. I love this bus! I have
been working on it since December when I got it, and I can't believe how
easy it is to maintain! I love the conversion too, much more than most
Westphalia conversions. It has the kind of pop-top that goes straight up,
instead of tilting, so It will sleep five comfortably. Two up top, and
three down low, since the bed goes all the way across. I could go on and
on...sink furnace and cabin its behind the driver's seat, 12V fridge and
two burner propane stove behind the passenger's seat. Roof rack for caring
even MORE stuff! She needs some electrical work, new paint, a new blower
motor (low priority here in AZ), and probably new wheel bearings and tires.
I wouldn't sell her for the world though. I am a VW fanatic thanks to this
bus! I can't wait to have more VW engines to work on. I want a bug for my
fiance next. Get rid of her nasty GMC truck, which is on it's last leg
anyway. :~)
&lt;/ENDLESS DESCRIPTION&gt;

I noticed that at the Bus Depot they have Compressors that can be installed
on my '77. Has anybody ever installed such an item? How much does it bring
down mileage? Does it even work? If so, how, since I would expect that the
air that comes from back there would have to go through the heat exchangers
which would ruin all the cooling produced by the compressor. I don't really
like the idea of mucking with the engine much, so this is not a very
attractive option to me.

I have also been looking at Swamp coolers (which work great here except in
Monsoon season!). Has anybody ever used one of these? If so which one, and
how well did it work? I have been looking at:

Anybody know of a cheaper place to acquire such an item?

Thanks,
Nick
