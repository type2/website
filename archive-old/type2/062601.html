Subject: bye bye VWS

I've been driving transporters (and the occasional beetle or Karman Ghia) almost
every day for thirty years and I havn't gotten addicted yet!!  On the few times
I've been vanless I've felt deeply homeless; and every van I passed on the
street felt like home.  A friend of mine says that his '79 westy is the only
thing which he has which is truly his own.

But despite all the wisdom, grace and reason of V W Van ownership, there is
still an element of madness to it.....  John Jensen in Annapolis
