Subject: Re: [T2] Bus for sale

Had a couple in a $50K BMW try to buy my bus on the spot. Would have traded of course. Wanted to tell them they had no IDEA of what they were getting into. Caring and driving old cars are MUCH different than driving a 2 year old BMW. 

They'd prob dump $5K into it, still have old car problems (that is fix the cosmetics and not address any mehcanical issues issues), drive it 'til it died (declare it junk but still worth a fortune) and try to sell it for $5K over market (my price to them being fair market). Now I just point the well off folks to the Eurovan Weekenders when they say they want my bus. 

Am trying to buy an '89 Cabrio from a couple who have done just that. Paint, seat covers and top. 170K miles, original engine and tranny and they are asking 2-3 times over market price (www.kbb_dot_com). They still need all the weatherstriping, all the engine maintenance done, alignment, repair 1/2 of the interior (dash and door panels) which are falling off and falling apart, and rehab the whole trunk (no top boot, not trunk floor between spare and cargo, no jack).
