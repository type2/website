Subject: Riviera for sale

I have a 71 Riviera for sale.  Is very rough.  No motor or trany.  Bought to
restore and then came to the conclusion that I have too many projects in my
front driveway and the neighbors are going to kill me.  It has the small pop
top (that is actually in very good condition.  The upolstery needs to be
redone, needs curtains, new linoleum in the kitchen area and front seat
covers.  Cabinets are in decent condition, some are scratched up.  Is red
with a white stripe.  Needs front clip work (someone did a bad bondo job).
WIll sell for $600.  P-email me for details.  Has good tires : )
