&gt; I dont use any type of glue. That just makes it harder to clean up the

Don't use grease. This allow the gasket to get &quot;sucked&quot; and you'll end up
with leaks.

Although grease seals you want to use something that keeps the gasket from
moving. Grease will never do that. Here's a sucked gasket that was applied
with a light coat of wheel bearing grease:
