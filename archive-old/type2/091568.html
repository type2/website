&gt; To jump start a vehicle, using another vehicle, a good procedure would be to

No.  The cigarette lighter is only good for about 10 amps of current,
while the starter uses 50 amps or so.  The wiring wouldn't take it.

Now, you _can_ use the lighter socket for battery charging if the current
isn't too high.  I've done this, but not on a bus since it doesn't have a
lighter!
