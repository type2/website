I just saw a perfect Riviera pop top in the junk yard in the Portland Oregon
area, the tent was even in good condition.

If anyone has ever wanted to make their transporter into a camper this would
be easy and cheap.

It was at a U-Pull it wrecking yard off Sunnyside rd.

Thought someone might be interested.
