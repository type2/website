Subject: Re: [T2] Hey!  Parts Junkies!

[...]

&gt; I'd really like to get the original VW parts number for the rear glass (yes,
&gt; it has the defroster grid) for a 1970 Bus.  Or, just in case the numbers
&gt; changed for some reason,  any year window with defroster grid which will fit the rear opening.  Can any of
you parts gurus supply those numbers for me?

There were 2 different windows, early and late. The difference is where the wire connectors are. Early are in
the center, the wires go thru the hatch and come out thru a grommet. Late are at the top, the wires do not
touch the hatch. I believe the break was at the end of 74.
Early = 211 845 495
Late = 211 845 495A
