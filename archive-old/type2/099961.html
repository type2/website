Subject: Windshield trouble

 I've got a windshield with rust under it that I hope to have properly repaired soon.  In the meatime I've sealed it up a little where it was leaking when it rained.

Yesterday it rained like you wouldn't believe and water started to come in through the seal in a couple of places: the water hit the window, went down the inside of the seal, under the glass, and came up between the glass and seal on the inside.

I had this windshield replaced in 1997 just before I made the trek to Austin but I'm not sure if they put on a new seal.  I would guess not by the state of the seal now (dry and a little cracked in the corners).

I have to go on a trip and it's likely that it will rain on me while I'm on the road.  What can I do to seal the glass to the seal as a temp. fix up?

I'd like to replace the seal now but I don't want to disturb the rust underneath until I can have the bodywork done to repair the damage.
