Subject: Squirrelly fuel gauge sender repair.

Hello List,

Well, I pulled my old gas tank out today so I could
replace it with a FI fuel tank. Both the fuel gauge
sender that was in my bus and the one that is in the
replacement tank were messed up. Each had breaks in
their resistor windings. I was able to reconnect and
solder one of the windings on one sender. Because that
side of the coil was badly worn, I took it out of the
metal shell and flipped it over. I put it back
together and tested it with my DVM and it worked
beautifully, or so I thought. when I tested it in my
bus, It worked but because I flipped the coil over,
the readings were backwards. When I moved the float
all the way down, the gauge registered full and vise
versa. I tried reversing every connection but it read
the same way. I ended up having to make new empty and
full labels for the gauge face. All and all, I guess
it was worth it. I saved over $40 fixing it instead of
replacing it. If the sender ever fails in the future,
I will probably just make a dip stick for the gas cap
and forget about it. Any how, I thought I would share.
Have a great day!
