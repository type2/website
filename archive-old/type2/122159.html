Subject: Rear Tire Clearance

I need some help about rear tire clearance. I have installed a 15x5.5 rim with
a 195/65/15 tire and the rear tire clearance is about 1/4&quot; from the side wall.
I am very concerned that this is just too close and risk  the side wall being
cut by the outside wheel well.  The rear hight is stock so the tire sits in
the wheel well about 1 3/4&quot;. I have talked with other Bus owners and they seem
to think this won't be a problem but I thought I would ask to get as much
input as possible.
