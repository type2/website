Subject: White LED's answer..... and request for 81'Vanagon AirFlow Meter.

The White LED's give a lot of useful, visible light.  While some of the 
Red,Orange,and Yellow LED's carry a high MCD rating, they eye responds 
differently to different colors. The eye will perceive some lights as 
brighter than others even though they have the same MCD rating. Regardless of 
what a light meter says, how they eye sees the light is what counts.  Most of 
the people who have seen the white LED
s say they look brighter than the red or yellow LED's..
at this time there are only two places to find white LED's As they become 
more popular they will become easier to find...Try:

LED-1 SL-A05C11-SB; 1800-722-5445 for local Selectra distributor
CMD333UWC 1800-344 -4539 DigiKey: they will ship orders under 25.00 others 
will 
not
 NOW FOR A QUESTION:

My 81 Vanagon is Backfiring like a mutha!!!!!.... The compression and 
everything is OK I suspect theAir Flow Meter.  I have a new one from a 
different model and when I push open the air flap nice and slow my Volt Ohm 
meter shows a nice gradual increase in resistance as it is opened and a 
corresponding decrease in resistance as it closed.  The AFM on my Vanagon 
jumps all over the place when I try the same test (Unit out of car)  I cant 
believe how Ding Dang Expensive these things are new!!! (Even rebuilt from 
BusBoys is hard on the wallet)  I have been to several local Junkyards and 
every Air Flow Meter I test Jumps around all over the place like my old 
one..Are they all bad?  I am following the testing procedure listed in 
Bently...I just cant believe that out of the twelve I tested at the Junkyard 
none of them worked.  Am I doing something wrong?  Dose anyone know how to 
repair the small circuit board inside the AFM?  It looks like the wipers of a 
Potentiometer run along two traces on metallicized conductive plastic and 
perhaps after many cyclings it is getting worn off.  Barring that where is 
the killer deal on Air Flow Meters?  It was getting bad ....but now I cant 
even pretend to drive this thing it backfires so severely. Please any help 
would be appreciated.
Thanks,
