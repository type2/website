Hi Marvin!:

&gt;  have a 77 Westy (lime green). Decided to buy new rubber, so I read 
&gt;  everything anybody had to say about tires on type2. Armed with this info, 
I 
&gt;  called my local tire guy and asked for 195/75R14 C tires with reinforced 
&gt;  sidewalls.

I run the 6 plys... 

&gt;  He says he has a Toyo tire, grade C made for light trucks and SUV's. So he 
&gt;  installs them today (great deal all 4 installed/balanced $210), I pick it 
up 

Not bad...
 
&gt;  and I find the tires are not C rated. They turn out to be Toyo 185/75R14 
&gt;  92S.

Wrong tire... read &quot;bait and switch&quot;.  He offered the C rated ones at that 
price, he should make good.
  
&gt;  I confront him on this and he says they're C rated and have reinforced 
&gt;  sidewalls.

No they're not... they're a **light** truck tire.  Your westy (like mine) is 
**not** a light truck.
  
&gt;  According the Toyo_dot_com the tires specs are:
&gt;  Ratings
&gt;  UTQG Treadwear 380
&gt;  UTQG Traction A
&gt;  UTQG Temperature B
&gt;  M and S Rated
&gt;  Max PSI 35
&gt;  Max Load 1400

That says it there - Max load 1400.  **NO** margin for safety.  Get her 
loaded for camping, spin down the road at 65, let 'em get nice and hot.  
Yiiii!!
  
&gt;  Toyo's Description: The Toyo® M410 Open Country offers riding comfort and 
&gt;  quiet performance for pick-ups, vans, and SUVs. Its shock-absorbing 
&gt;  construction smooths out bumps in rough roads making it ideal for highway 
&gt;  versatility.

But not your truck AKA Westy.
  
&gt;  Will these work or should I raise hell with him to switch them out? The 
were  
&gt;  $35 less than the &quot;comparable&quot; Michelin tires. If so just run 'em at 35psi?

Nononononono!!!  These tires will not work for your baby, and you need the C 
rated (or D rated, if you can get 'em) tires... otherwise you are looking at 
a potential tire failure.  Hit a bump, the load on that tire goes up from 
almost 1000 lbs to 2000+.  Go in and raise hell and get the right tires for 
your truck... What he did is both unethical and unsafe.  I guarantee you I'd 
*never* buy tires from his place of business again!

I get the factory spec conti's.  Yeah, they're costly as hell, but I know 
they'll not do wierd things from being overloaded.  And hey, that &quot;Conti&quot; 
name on the side looks kewl!
