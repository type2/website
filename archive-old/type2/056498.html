Subject: hot start relay didn't work - now what?

I have a 1981 Westfalia I acquired recently, and it has a serious hot start
problem.  Symptoms are typical - one or two stops, maybe three, it starts
OK but by the third one it might take a while to light properly.  By the
third stop or later it is very difficult to start, or won't start at all.
Once, after some serious highway driving, and a couple of minutes of trying
to start, it would not even turn over (at all, not even a click from the
starter solenoid) even though I have dual batteries and a quick check of
lights etc showed I have plenty of juice.

I know it is heat related, because if I open the rear hatch and remove the
engine cover for a few minutes, it clears up and I can start fine.  The lack
of juice to the starter when the lights etc work great indicates it is not
a vapor lock or something like that.

Last weekend, I decided to work on it (I have had the van for about three
weeks).  I opened both battery compartments, cleaned the terminals and the
battery cables, pulled the ground straps loose and cleaned up around their
connections, replaced one of the ground straps entirely, and replaced an
old battery with one that is about five months old.  (I also cleaned up and
regreased the swivel mechanisms of the front seats while I was under there,
and cleaned up some of the battery corrosion (only in ONE battery box - yeah!),
etc.

Then I crawled under the car, pulled the various connectors from the starter
and cleaned them up and inspected the cables, pulled the groundstrap from the
transaxle to the chassis on both ends and cleaned it, and then wired in a
Bosch relay as explained in these mailing lists and various documents on the
web.

Result: I still have a hot start problem.  What should I try next?  Replace
or rebuild the starter?  Pull all new wires (I really don't want to do
that)?  Wait till winter?  Be more patient (yeah, right)?  Replace or clean
the battery isolator switch, or some other switch/component?  Buy a new van?

Thanks in advance for any and all suggestions,

John Cronin
