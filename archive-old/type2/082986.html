Subject: Re: [T2] GEX Engine

Well, you might change the oil a few times.  My first and last GEX engine
lasted 40K miles in a well-maintained bug.  If this bus engine lives up to
the GEX standard, you will have a year or so to save up for the new
engine.

GEX still owes me the Bentley manual that was a &quot;bonus&quot; when buying an
engine.

Just be glad that you don't have to get a core deposit back from them!  :)

&gt; I have a GEX motor in my squareback. I didn't buy it , it came with the car.
&gt; Don't bother changing the oil or doing any other maintenance. All that extra
&gt; money spent on tune ups will be needed for a new motor =)
&gt;
&gt; BTW , It has less than 10,000 miles on it and has 2 pulled head studs and a
&gt; pulled exhaust on cylinder 2 and it leaks oil like nuts, has no
&gt; power...................... and yes I did routine maintenance until
&gt; recently.
