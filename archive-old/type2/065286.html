Subject: tie rods

        Did the tie rod thing on the '63 single cab this weekend.  I orderd 
     two left side assemblies so they would both be adjustable.  After 
     spending about 30 minutes banging and prying the old ones I gave up, 
     went to the store and bought the pickle forks and a dead blow hammer.  
     back under the vehicle I whacked 3 or 4 times with these new weapons 
     and off they came.  DO THIS boys and girls.  Remember, Mr Natural 
     says:  &quot;Use the right tool for the job!&quot;
        The new rods and ends were assembled and then adjusted to the 
     length of the old ones for a rough place to begin.  A 70 miles test 
     run showed no appreciable left or right pull, a noticable improvement 
     in steering handling, and the clanging noises were gone, as was the 
     deceleration wobble.  Success!  Next - swing lever pin.  Spent last 
     night assembling tools to remove and then install new bushings for 
     that job.  I feel confident.
        Replaced the old ground cable that produced the smoke test and used 
     a little copper anti-seize, then sprayed with the battery goop and we 
     now have a strong cranker.  What a difference!  If only the wipers 
     were so good :^(.   Thanks to all for advice and encouragement once 
     again.  It's a constant process of being reminded of the basics, aint 
     it?
     Ray
