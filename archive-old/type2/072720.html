&gt;The CO is 3% before &amp; after the
converter.  That obviously means the converter is bad.

Not necessarily.  The Cat does lower CO but it's main function is to lower
NOx.  Most IM tests (unless you're on a dyno don't test for NOx)

 &gt;The other thing is,
the mechanic had to back out the CO screw on the airbox all the way to get
it to 3%.  Here is my questions.  How much will the catalytic converter
&gt;lower the CO?

It doesn't sound like the cat to me.  More than likely its the O2 sensor.
This can be checked easily with a $6 VOM meter from Harbor Freight.
Disconnect the 02 sensor lead after the engine has warmed up and attach a
VOM set for milli volts.  It should bounce back and forth between say 350
to 750 mv.  If it stays on the high side only, look for something else that
is making it rich, i.e., cold start valve, plugged aircleaner, bad temp
sensors, etc.  If it stays on the low side (with the O2 sensor disconnected
from the ECU) you probably need to replace the o2 sensor as it is the
culprit that is causing the ECU to make your mixture rich.


&gt; Also, would you just get a CAT &amp; try DEQ before buying a new
&gt;AFM?

No.  Check the above.  Reset the idle CO best you can using the test for
the o2 sensor and take it to a shop for a CO test only.  Adjust it
accordingly.  What is the test limits in your area for CO, NOx, HC.  Where
does your bus fall currently for these.

The following is a  graph of  CO and HC by fuel mixture :

Connect the dots and you can see the relationship between CO and HC.

Also, from the graph you see that at stoich (14.7:1) CO is still
approximately .5% CO.  I think that is  about what the Cat takes out of the
exhaust stream.

Have fun
