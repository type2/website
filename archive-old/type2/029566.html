&gt; Amateur Radio (Ham Radio) operators have access to a wide range of
&gt; options that would provide a solution.
&gt; 
&gt; One of them uses the radio, radio modems, packet data transfer and a
&gt; network that is already established for the transfer of photos.
&gt; 
I think that the data rate is rather low on these, isn't it?  The gateway
to the internet would be an interesting (but not insurmountable) problem.
&gt; 
&gt; An offshoot of the above network, is that you can put a GPS unit in the
&gt; car along with a the radio unit and you can have a built in tracker,
&gt; complete with direction of travel, current speed and distance traveled.
&gt; I have one such tracker that with the proper help on NQ's end, could be
&gt; set up to provide 24/7 location info as to the NQ parade.
&gt; 
&gt; I will be putting one of these trackers in both the DC and Jag and will
&gt; always have tabs on my vehicles.

This is going into mine as soon as my daughters reach dating age :)

&gt; Erin,
&gt; Now to make it complete, you could run out, cram for the license test
&gt; and get your license before heading out on the trip.  Alternatively you
&gt; could recruit a Ham operator as a co-pilot.

Now, there's an interesting question.  I know that a lot of hams run APRS
mobiles 24/7.  Is this strictly legal, or is a control operator required?
If it is legal, you could put your unit in Erin's vehicle and let it run
independently.
