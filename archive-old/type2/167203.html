Subject: Problem: Fan Belt Adjustment Nut

Hello All --
I have a 1979 bus with a fuel-injected engine, which has a loose fan belt in 
dire need of tightening.  A simple enough task, but I can't get it done 
because the adjustment nut for loosening the pulley and tightening the belt 
is frozen.  I've been dousing the nut with Liquid Wrench over the past few 
days (overnight as well) but it still won't move.  I've been using a couple 
of short six-point 6mm allen wrenches to try and loosen the thing but with 
lack of a better tool and the general lack of elbow room inside the rear 
hatch, I'm now wondering if I'm going at this wrong.  Is there a more 
effective tool or method I should be using for this?  Anyone have any other 
tips and tricks for loosening this nut?  Thanks for any help!
