Scott, we have a '74 almost ready for the crusher. I can get you this part.
A picture would help and then, you or I can draw the cut line using a photo
editor to assure a proper cut. If any else needs a small (shippable) body
parts let me know. We can ship most anything but if the part gets to big for
UPS it gets ugly.$$
