Subject: [T2] brake booster to decel vale elbow is it NLA

today the busdepot says that this part is on backorder.  they say it will be
a couple of weeks.  i heard today on the samba that is NLA.  any work
arounds out there?   i have included pics to  show you  guys  why i think my
78 cranks but then dies.  am i correct in thinking this is a big vacuum
leak?  could this possibly be my problem ?   the pump, afm, double relay,
are all fine and the s hose is leak free.  new injector seals too.  also no
apparent electrical issue.
