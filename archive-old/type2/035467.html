Subject: PST &quot;Dead of Winter&quot; Campout (GA)

It is that time of year again...

Peach State Transporters will be holding it's 4th Annual Dead of
Winter Campout at Cloudland Canyon State Park in the NW Georgia
mountains February 4-6.  The park is off GA 136, 8 miles east of
Trenton and I-59, 18 miles NW of Lafayette.  Those interested can
email me for more details.

Last year we had about twenty buses over the weekend, even though 
we had some nasty weather on Saturday night.

There are two different campgrounds, and they have cabins for those 
of you who don't like cold weather camping.  Campsites have water 
and electric hookups, so bringing space heaters is a good idea.  
This year Charlie Ford will be bringing his deep fryer and I will 
spring for a couple of turkeys for dinner Saturday night.  If you 
haven't tried fried turkey, you should!  I'll cook breakfast for 
everyone Sunday morning also.

There are great hiking trails down to the waterfalls as well as 
around the canyon rim.  So bring warm clothes, extra blankets, 
musical instruments, firewood, and come join us for a great winter 
campout.

&quot;Located on the western edge of Lookout Mountain, Cloudland
Canyon is one of the largest &amp; most scenic state parks in Georgia.
The park provides visitors with beautiful vistas of the rugged
geology of this area and an excellent outdoor setting for the camper
or hiker wanting to experience the beauty of the natural world.&quot;

The first site is from the DNR &amp; the 2nd one has a few photos of 
the area.

So pack some warm clothes and I hope to see you there.
