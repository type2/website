Subject: Re: [T2] Side window seal

&gt; For the second time on a row, I have opened my door to find that water is
draining out of it! I figure it is
&gt; because the water that it hitting my side roll-down windows is simply
dibbling down to the bottom and the
&gt; running out the door when I open it.


Jason, thank you very much for your posting.  It opened my eyes.

At the base of the front doors in a late bay is a 'step' with a rubber
thread on it.  When the front doors are closed, this 'step with rubber
thread' is not visible.

I have seen, on an absolutely rust free VW bus,  rust under the bottom of
the windshield lip, and the rust on this 'step with rubber thread'.

I understand how rain could affect a standing VW bus which was pointed DOWN
A SLOPE, but until now, I didn't understand how this step could get so much
rust damage.

Thanks again

FWIW, I bought a heat gun as Harbor Freight for $10, and it has well earned
a place on my workbench.

Have ever tried to re-positioned and attached the 30-year old rubber threads
to the three holes in the step??  The three rubber tits are like concrete.
I use the heat gun to warm the rubber thread and lengthen and position it to
fit the three holes, and then heat and soften three rubber tits.  Works
great.

I don't use the heat gun for window rubber because that is usually new or
like new condition or it is replaced.
