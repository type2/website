Subject: Trouble down under my '75 Westy Deluxe

I've had this beast for going on five years, now, and I think I've gotten
3,000 miles out of it in that time.  Military hauled it from Alaska (where
I bought it) to Bayonne, NJ (nearest drop-off point).  After innumerable
woes, I hauled it (on a U-Haul) home to Vermont.  Never did run for s--t
there.  

Got a job in Oregon a year ago, hauled it behind me to here (U-Haul again -
wife wants to name it &quot;We-Haul&quot;).  Haven't much messed with it since then.

Finally at a place where I can do some work on the thing.

Some background : It's a '75 Deluxe Westfalia (as noted in subject line),
date of manufacture 10/74.  (VIN is 2352035748, if it's important.)  A PO
apparently blew the engine (compartment is FILTHY!), and replaced the stock
1800 FI with same from a '72 Type IV (S/N EA080753, again, if it matters). 


After I bought it, the automatic tranny gave out (lost third &amp; reverse in
the middle of Alaskan woods, with a Christmas tree strapped to the roof,
fer gossakes!). That sidelined it for quite some time.  I prevailed upon
the wife to have the tranny rebuilt before we moved back East. (The events
leading up to its U-Haul ride from NJ after that are really too painful to
relate just now...)

SO!  I have this wonderful bright green bus, new tranny, new brakes, mostly
new studded tires (illegal now in Oregon... &lt;Sigh&gt;), and an engine that is
sorting through various deeply-felt psychological wounds.  (I am convinced,
BTW, that many of its woes are caused by simple overheating, in turn caused
by a lack of understanding of the crucial role of the engine seals - St.
Muir does not stress this as effectively as you on the list - thank you!)

Crawling about under it the other day, I made some somewhat disturbing /
potentially costly discoveries - and wanted to get some ideas from the
folks here.

Most immediately, I discovered that the driver-side hand brake has frozen. 
The brake was released, and while the passenger-side adjustment bolt is
sitting prettily in the yoke, the driver-side cable is lolling lazily out
through it.  Jacked the wheel, and sure 'nuff, brakes are engaged.

Bounced this one off of a co-worker (also a listie - Hi, Brent!), and he
suggested that best-case, the problem is in the cable, close to one end or
the other.  Haven't had a chance to test this theory yet, but wanted to
know what to do if it's a worse-case, where the shoes are frozen to the
drum (disk?) (and if there's a worst-case that I may have failed to
imagine!).

This condition has existed for around a year and a half -- it suddenly
started making a wicked grindy noise at that time, and I (appropriately
frightened) stopped driving it.  I did have to move it a few miles once,
but it's basically been on &amp; off the U-Haul trailer since then.  Since this
did not cause the shoes to break free, does this indicate cable is more
likely?  And have I wrecked the whole thing with what driving I did do on
it?  Would pulling the wheel and giving it a good BANG do any good (other
than releasing years of frustration)? 

Next - while skootching around under there, I noticed that there's a little
boxy-shaped thing, with a disky-shaped assembly attached to its left-hand
side, located just to the left of the tin at the front of the vehicle. 
What is this thing?  Co-worker suggested steering-assist unit - did the '75
have such a thing?  Reason for concern is that it is heavily coated in some
sort of fluid. (Did not feel or smell - sorry.  Did not want crap in my
eyes... dirty under there!)  Is this normal / acceptable, or do I have
another expensive emergency to deal with before trying to road this thing
again?

There's more, but it's late, and I've used enough bandwidth for one
evening.  Any answers / ideas / laughter are welcome.  Thanks in advance,
volks!
