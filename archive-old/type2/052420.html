&gt;I agree with Rick.  A lightened flywheel will not gain you any horsepower
at all.  Plus a counterweighted crank (which is much heavier than stock)
will cancel out much of the weight saved in the flywheel.
&gt;
&gt;IMO the bus needs a heavier flywheel, not lighter.

&gt;&gt;dunebuggies where you &quot;snap&quot; the gas pedal and jump around corners.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;say if a person with a type I- powered bus lived in a very hilly area
like
&gt;&gt;&gt;the ozarks or cascades and did most of their driving there...wouldn't it
be
&gt;&gt;&gt;a benefit to use a 12.5# flywheel with a counterweighted crank?  i
realize
&gt;&gt;&gt;the stock flywheel would be better for long flat hauls....where i live,
&gt;&gt;&gt;there is like five 30 degree hills every mile....
