Subject: seats from '84 non-westy Vanagon

I gave a junkyard $150 to pull most anything I wanted off of a
van here in Salt Lake.  Included are some dirty but otherwise
quite nice seats; it's a GL.  I kept the front ones.  Oooooh,
comfort.  No horsehair in these babies, I don't think!  If you
live nearby and need seats, give me a call.
