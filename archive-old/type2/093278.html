Subject: Re: [T2] Washer hose


&gt;Has anyone replaced their windshield washer hoses?  I sprung a leak a while
&gt;back and I'd like to know  how much I need to order.
&gt;
&gt;I think it's 3.5mm right?

Buy it at the local FLAPS so you can get enough and go back for more.

Because it is only washer hoses, get anything that fits.

If I was placing an order for other items too I would buy it mail order.

Basically the hose has to run from the passenger side to the column via any 
route you want to use, and then to the column, and then out to the nozzles 
via a splitter.

Grab your wife's fabric sewing tape measure and go at it.
