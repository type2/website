Scot:

I recently performed this procedure on my 71, and I didn't have the kind 
of trouble it seems like you're encountering.  It almost sounds like you've 
got either a wrong center pin or bushings, or do you know that your bus 
has an original, or a correct replacement axle beam??  I followed the Muir 
book, and it was WAY more helpful than the Haynes manual.  Anyway, the center 
pin shouldn't be tight.  You should be able to rotate it with your fingers.  
Also, you shouldn't have to have reamed the bushings, which is why I asked 
if you had the right parts.  You should be able to rotate the center pin 
with your fingers until the groove is pretty much in the right location, 
then with a c-clamp squeeze everything together.

Sorry about your frustration, I feel your pain.  Good luck.
