Subject: Re: [T2] h2o cooled

&gt;I want to invest in a VW Bus, but do not like air cooled engines

Why don't you just buy a watercooled Vanagon, the 86's and later where 2L, 
and with all the money you'd be saving from modifiying an aircooled to 
watercooled you could probably buy a decent 4 wheel drive Vanagon Syncho.

Just a suggestion.
