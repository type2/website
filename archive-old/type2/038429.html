Subject: Gaskets/seals

I'm getting ready to pull my engine to locate the source of an internal
clattery noise (not lifters) that is getting worse.  This engine is a stock
'79 2.0L rebuilt from my original case by one of the engine rebuilders
often referred to on the list, and has around 6500 miles since the rebuild.

My question is:
I need to order a gasket kit and seals, and I want high quality gaskets
that don't leak or deteroriate.  I've heard that its important to use a
certain kind (viton? neoprene?) of seals for the pushrod tubes.  What type
of seals and gaskets should I use and where should I go to purchase them.
What else do I need to know?

Thanks

'79 Westy

P.S.  When I get to the bottom (smirk) of this, I'll post with what I found
to be the problem.
