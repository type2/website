The decel valve operates to reduce the over rich condition which occurs
when you are decelerating. It is there to reduce fuel consumption and
emissions output. It works by sucking the vane in the AFM closed on
deceleration.

You most likely would not notice a real difference in driveability, as
it makes no difference to things when you would care about it. You might
notice an increase in fuel consumption if you watch it very closely.
Changing the plugs might show a rich mixture. When I replaced mine on my
'77 I noticed a 2 mpg jump in economy. Given gas prices today that means
it may pay for itself in short order if it is faulty.

To check it pull off the large hose that goes from the valve to the S
duct on the air sensor. Plug the S duct with a cork and start the
engine. Run the engine at 3000 rpm with the throttle valve. Put your
hand over the end of the hose, and let the throttle snap closed
suddenly. You should feel a sucking on your hand. No suck, replace the
decel valve. In my experience a new valve will suck harder than an old
valve.

I am not sure on the interchangeability of the decel valves. It is
probably best to get the correct one.
