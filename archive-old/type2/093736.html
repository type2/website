Hi Volks,

Jamie, are you *sure* that it's brake fluid??

We dropped he engine on Dad's 81 Westy last night, due to low 
compression in #4. In the process I found a small amount of fuel in the 
brake booster vacuum line. Not a lot, but more than a few drops came out 
when I pulled the line. Since that line connects right off the intake 
manifold I suspect the brakes must be pulling some fuel into the vacc 
line.

Could be related to your problem, perhaps the fuel mix is being drawn 
into the booster as vapor and then condenses back to liquid and slowly 
accumulates. Dad says his brakes are working fine.

If it's brake fluid, it would have had to come from somewhere. Brake 
fluid comes in small bottles, and the resevoir is also pretty small.  2L 
is enough to make you remember the refills. If it came out of the lines 
you'd have really bad braking.

Just inside the front tinwork the booster vac. line has a cylindrical 
fitting about 1.5&quot; in diameter and about the same length. That fitting 
then connects to the fuel rail. What is its purpose? If it's supposed to 
stop the fuel vapors, it's not working quite as well as it should.

Happy trails,

question is:

What would make a power brake system fill the booster with fluid, and 
pull the
pedal to the floor on it's own?
