Subject: away

hey all
I will be leaving for the week to go hunting in northern WI.
So I will be away from my email for a while.  I just don't want to
unsub.  If you HAVE to get ahold of me, I can be reached at 715.362.4557

so Thom, Steve, and  Dana, and anyone else...I will get back to you.

I don't know if this message was absolutely necessary..but there are a
lot of people I have been working deals with lately...most of them are
on the lists.

thanks all!

Adios.
