Subject: [T2] R-Paint

Gentlepersons-
                       ...With those R-#'s, I'll paint the inside of my Bus 
pink! Could the list mem-
ber with the source for &quot;R-Paint&quot; repost, either to the list or me, 
Sherman-O'Brien is a
brand I'm unfamiliar with...Sherwin Williams, or Fuller O'Brien, maybe...A 
site with a fact
sheet'd be nice too...
TIA
