Hello,

   Today I was looking at prices for replacing some of the old tired parts
on my 78 van fuel injection system. It was sobering to see that just to
replace the injectors would cost $360.00.
  At the same time I see that there are companies that specialize in new
fuel injection systems starting at about $850 and going up to around $2000.
   My question  to you:  Have any of you done such a complete change over to
an all new fuel injection system with success? If so, What company and
system did you go with ? One such company that I found on the web is called
Affordable Fuel Injection  at www.affordable-efi_dot_com .
   Also, I would imagine it is possible such an alternative system would
require a few other modifications such as different fuel pump. Any comments
?

Thanks,
