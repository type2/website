I think this deserves a price for ingenuity. It's a prime example of making
a paradigm shift. I never ever contemplated the idea that you get have
something else than water coming out of the tap. Maybe we can create a sort
of contest out of this.
Every 3 months or so we can have a vote on the most ingenious, silly or
novel application for our beloved buses and give the winner a samll prize
(list hat or something).
