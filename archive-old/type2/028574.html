If you go to 
     http://www.conservatory_dot_com/vw/manuals_nyx/L-Jetronic.html

;then go to page, 24, I think, you will find a diagram of the fuel system. If you study this diagram, it may help you get a better idea of where the potential fuel leaks could be. Without determining where the leak is, it's impossible to know if it could be fixed without removing the engine.

FI (fuel-injected) fuel systems are under pressure when the vehicle is running. My guess is that you have some old lines and possibly a crack that isn't visible, but squirts gas when the system is pressurized. My other guess is that you live a charmed life, otherwise, you'd be a statistic.

There was a song we used to sing in my church when I was a kid: &quot;It only takes a spark to get a fire burning...&quot; In the case of an engine compartment full of fumes, it only takes half a spark. 
You may find that you need to turn the key on to get the fuel pump running and get the pressure you need to find the leak, but Please be exceedingly careful! If you have a short, for example, you'll get a spark at the battery terminal when you attach the cable. If your engine compartment is full of fumes when you do this, you can get an explosion.

I have been lucky around fuel leaks and fumes, but your situation sounds a little scary...at least cause for particular care. I would start with visual inspection of lines, starting under the bus by the starter. I always disconnect the battery when dealing with the starter area. The proximity of the high voltage starter lines to the fuel tappet...and the area design with can easyily trap vapors around the two, makes me nervous.

I would then check the lines feeding fuel into the engine compartment, including the connections at the fuel filter. Since you think it's coming from the tank area, another possibility is the fuel filler neck, behind the black circle thing in the engine compartment (passenger side); turn to remove. These crack and leak and drive people crazy. I haven't been able to find a stock replacement part yet, though I'm sure the archives might yield some suggestions.

Other than these suggestions, I would check the fuel ring and all other fuel lines.

Thanks! Joe

&gt;I own a '79 2.0 Fuel Injected Westy. Recently I had a sudden fuel leak out

&gt;figuring out where it was coming from. It seems to be coming from inside
&gt;the gas tank compartment, but after taking the panel off I can't tell what

&gt;	Could it be coming from the sending unit somehow?
&gt;	Is there anyway to fix without pulling the engine?
&gt;Thanks in advance.
