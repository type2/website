Subject: Generator for 71 Single Cab 1600

I recently purchased a Bosch Remanufactured Generator GR17X for a 1600 and
went to install in the 71 Single cab.  Come to find out it is the wrong one.
It is just a touch longer.  Anyone know what it goes to?  Or even better a
way to make it work  :)

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
Snoopy
