OK, I'll admit it, my gauges (VDO &amp; Westreck) are inaccurate!!! However,
when traveling at 60/65 MPH and they are all reading as they did the last
time I traveled at 60/65 MPH , and at the same temp and humidity, I feel
comfortable- I relax and enjoy the scenery. An occasional glance and I am
happy. My engine still passes the &quot;Muir&quot; dipstick test when I check my oil
at the next gas stop.

However, should I notice a deviation from the norm, I know to find out the
cause first and not later on the side of the road. That is the value of
gauges. ( and I'm a gauge nut)  Just my .02 worth....TBear
