Subject: Re: [T2] 2.0 1978 engine rebuild  questions

Dan,

I am sure you are doing this but I'll say it anyway. Use new Mahle pistons 
and cylinders, and new AMC heads. With the engine crank and rods stock. ( 
don't let them 3 over your crank, 2 max, and give them your new wrist pins 
for re-bushing the rods) No need to check CC. It is always cool to learn why 
and how your engine is a 2.0L or how close it is to a 2.0L. The kits that 
most sell are cheap and frankly more of an art then a science to use for any 
real data. The only thing you put between the piston and the case is the 
thin (so thin you can't breath on em without bend'n em) shims that come in 
the gasket set. Then with the AMC heads you don't put anything between the 
piston and heads.

I use SEA 30 or 20/50 and I change in 300 miles then as much as you want 
after. I leave the screen but replace the filter. On first 300 mile oil 
change the oil will glisten with micro bits of metal from bearings etc. 
These can bond to hot bearing surfaces eventually and cause some problems, 
as well as slow oil delivery and the engine just hates that metallic after 
taste.

Read up on ring seating, there are many takes on that and other break in 
procedures. I just get in and floor it till I hit the Kansas border. I'm 0 
for 10 so far this year. Wish me luck next time.

-Joe (make sure it goes back together super, super stock. a hole in your tin 
is like a hole in the radiator of your real car) oops, did I just say that?


&gt; 1.  Do I need to shim the cylinders?   Stock rebuild here, nothing 
&gt; modified.  Same pistons, rods, cam, heads as a 78.
&gt; 2.  Do I need to CC the heads?
&gt;
&gt; 3.  Is 20-50 weight oil ok for break in?   I have read on the break in of 
&gt; the motor and will change the oil very often during the first 500 miles.
