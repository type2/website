&gt; at 60 MPH, to notice the draft??

your nuts, but for what its' worth at about a 1/2 the truck length back
(25-30ft) it's almost a free ride, I have gotten over 40mpg doing that,
but the concentration and intensity is insane and as crazy as it sounds
those big rigs can stop faster than a bus if the brakes are in good
condition.
