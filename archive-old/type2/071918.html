Please help solve my mystery. My 2L twin carbed engine will tick over
nicely at around 300 rpm on each separate carb. i.e. no 12v on the idle air
valve and only one of the fuel cut off valves connected at a time. Then
when I hook up both the carbs and the idle valve I have 1300 rpm and
nothing I do with idle fuel or air settings makes any difference to the
speed. It drives well but the revving while at the lights is driving me
nuts.

Please someone have an answer for me.
