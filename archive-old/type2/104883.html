Subject: Cheap Bosch Points, any thoughts????

Hello List,

I ran across  some points on Eb_at_y a couple days ago.
The seller has them for our bay window buses in a lot
of 100. The price is around $20 a lot unboxed. I have
contacted every person that I could who has bought
these from the seller and this is what I have found
out.

The Good: They have  Bosch on them, and they have
bakalite rubbing blocks.

The Bad: They are suppose to be the &quot;older&quot; design
which uses a c clip to hold them together.( I don't
know if this is actually bad or not) Some think they
were made in Brazil or Mexico. One buyer states: &quot;The
points seemed to be good. I have installed three sets
and no problems, however some of the points were not
usable in my application because the locator pin on
some of the point sets was smaller than the locator
hole and moved around in the locator hole....&quot; This
buyer also says that 69 out of 100 of the points did
not have this problem. 

The seller also has these points in a lot of 100,
boxed with their origional pack of cam lube for $30.

What do you think??? Even if only 2/3 of the lot were
good, the boxed points only cost $0.43 a piece. Is it
worth it??? Any thoughts on Brazil and Mexican Bosch
parts? The part number on these is: FEDITCO P/N
ADP-032, 1-237-013-044, same as BOSCH P/N 01011.

Let me know what you think. I know that alot of the
newer Bosch points have the white soft plastic rubbing
blocks which often poses a problem. Thanks and Have a
great day!

P.S. With the seller's shipping price, the come out to
$0.55 apiece if only 2/3 of them are actually good.
