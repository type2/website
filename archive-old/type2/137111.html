Subject: Re: [T2] Help prevent a vanagon related suicide!

I had a conspiracy of problems contributing to something very similar, 
not all of which have been addressed yet. But the big ones included:

Vacuum leak at the intake manifold (now fixed and doing great)
Bad, nasty old brake hoses (currently disconnected)
Bad, nasty old brake booster/servo (currently disconnected)
Bad, nasty old generator (rebuilt for $60 a local shop, works great)
Bad, nasty old condenser (replaced and many problems went away; about to 
replace entire dizzy  to include a magnetic rotor and a vacuum advance)

Such stalling can be a real painful gremlin to chase. Good luck.
