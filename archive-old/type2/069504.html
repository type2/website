Subject: '81 Lifter? 

Howdy all yooz...

I started up my '81 Vanagon yesterday, and found to my dismay that there was a 
rather loud, persistent &quot;tak-tak-tak&quot; at idle, revving just makes it go 
&quot;taktaktaktaktak&quot;...I presume that this obnoxious noise is a stuck lifter, as it 
did not happen at all before....and it sounds like it's coming from the 3/4 
side...

So...I'll be cleaning lifters and bores...any advice on this and related areas? 
 What should I do/look for?  

Thanks...
