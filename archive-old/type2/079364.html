Subject: Nailing livestock was Re:[T2] front mounted tires.

FWIW... the typical bovine weighs in the vicinity of a thousand pounds. 
A thousand pounds is a thousand pounds.  Doesn't matter if it's meat or
concrete.  A few years ago I knocked over a medium sized doe.  Hit her
at about 5 mph. Pushed the nose of the bus in about four inches. Had I
not had a front mounted spare, the damage would have probably been
localized to the left headlight.  With the nose mounted spare the damage
extended three quarters of the way across. A proper repair will require
replacing the entire skin. (As it is, a bra now covers the damage.)

Nose mounted spare or no, the best course of action is to not run into critters.

Jim
