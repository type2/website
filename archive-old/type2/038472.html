Never tried this myself, but I *heard* that &quot;red-hot&quot;-heating up the
offending stub of a stud or bolt and then throwing a glass of ice-cold water
at it will cause the various parts to expand, then contract. They would do
so at slightly different rates, thus breaking up the rust that binds them.
