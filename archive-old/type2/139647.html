Subject: Re: [T2] Moving to Joplin, Missouri

Shawn,

Joplin, not sure. 

Neosho for sure.  This guy is one of the nicest folks you will ever meet 
and has been working on VW's since he was a kid in his Dad's shop.  After 
you get moved, just drop by and talk to him.

***Highly*** recomended
Darryl's Auto Center
1418 N Business 71
Neosho, MO 64850-6820
Phone: 	(417) 451-3926 

There is also a club in Neosho...just ask Darryl, and lots of action down 
toward the Arkansas line.

http://www.volksmeisters_dot_com/   (in Fayetteville, Arkansas)
http://www.nwavwa_dot_com/		(in Eureka Springs, Arkansas

Big show in Eureka Springs every year...last weekend before labor day 
weekend....generally about 200-300 cars each year.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hello, I am moving to Joplin, Mo. next week. I was
&gt; wondering if there is any list members or clubs around
&gt; that part of MO? Any VW friendly repair shops? I will
&gt; only be able to take my 78 Westy, and leave my 79 bus
&gt; behind. I hate to leave it behind but this is the
&gt; wrong time of the year to move so far, But I have a
&gt; friend in Ok. who drives truck, and makes runs this
&gt; way so I can pick it up later.
&gt; 
&gt; I am just interested in any info on the VW scene in
&gt; the southwest corner of Missouri.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks, 
&gt; Shawn Reed
