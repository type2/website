Richard,

Waht do you mean &quot;stuck&quot;?  If the bus has been sitting while (1), then one
or more of the lifters have lost the oil that keeps them expanded.  As a
result, they are clatter like a flamenco dancer on speed.  They are not
&quot;stuck&quot;, they are dry.  They will usually pump up and be fine in 30
seconds to 30  minutes.

&gt; This happened once before and what we did before was pour some Rislone (pine
&gt; tree smelling stuff) into the crankcase and it freed it up after running
&gt; (idling) a while.

Yup, they do.  The rislone is not necessary.

&gt; Is this still recommended?  If see that the lifters are only about $10.  Are
&gt; these hard to replace?

They are not hard to replace, but I sincerely doubt that it is necessary.
Start the engine, let it idle for ~1 minute.  Drive it around (*gently*)
for about 1/2 hour.  If any lifter is still clatering, replace it.

(1) &quot;while&quot; in this context depends on the age of the bus/lifter.  If they
are really old/loose/installed with the drain hole down, then it can be
overnight. Usually we are talking a month or more, tho.
