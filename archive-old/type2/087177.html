Subject: Re: [T2] Tranny bushings, linkages, adjustments?

Steve,Billy,

Haven't checked other responses yet, but I have what I figure are 
two options.

I can buy some small diameter(capilary small) copper tubing and braze it 
on to a fitting  and put it on my grease gun.  Then, by feel push it in 
the front tube and past the first plastic carrier until I feel it hit the second 
carrier....then by feel, move the end of it all around the plastic carrier 
while a helper pumps the daylights out of the gun.....did I mention that 
you would want the tranny to be in 1'st or third so that the carriers are 
toward the rear of their travel...that means that when you pul the shifter 
in to 2nd gear you are actually pulling the carrier into all of the grease 
you just deposited....do the same thing with the carrier closest to the 
front(it's easier to get to)....same with the rear, but with the tranny in 
2nd or 4th...first time you go to the other gears, you are pushing the 
carrier into the grease.

My other option is that I bought a special extension for my grease gun 
that must be for pressure greasing thru some sort of gm type rubber nipple 
grease fittings.  I'm thinking I might measure down the tube to each 
plastic carrier and then drill a very small hole in the outer 
tubing..._dot_use the special adapter and just put about 100 pumps of the 
grease gun thru it....then seal the hole by using a couple of wraps of 
electrical tape or something similar.

Opinions?....once again...How the heck did they do it at the factory???

Cheers, dave

&gt; Pardon the possible forgetfulness, it's been a couple years, but...
&gt; 
&gt; The &quot;protrusion&quot; on the bottom of the shifter is a pin about an inch long
&gt; that goes thru the ball.  It does locate the shifter and keeps it from
&gt; twisting.  thing is, if it slides back at all, you have a bear of a time
&gt; getting the ball into the cup.  The freudian implications are enormous :-)
&gt; The solution I have is to make sure the cup is stuffed with new grease and
&gt; that pin and ball are slathered as well.  That at least provides some help
&gt; in keeping the conical spring from kicking the pin back.  Remember that he
&gt; pin has to be all the way forward.  The problem comes if it is at all back
&gt; thru its hole.
&gt; 
&gt; On greasing the carriers, well, a long bottle brush slathered with grease?
&gt; Even more freudian, but it might work :-)
