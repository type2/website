Chris, man, please don't ever go near a bus with a gas heater as it will
turn you into an emotional wreck. =^ )

&gt;&gt;It's an easy way to change the Fuel tank sender without pulling the
&gt;&gt;engine.
&gt;&gt;I've done it twice with no side effects, and would do it again.

&gt;This is a prime example of a &quot;slash and burn&quot; repair job.

&gt;someone got the idea to saw a hole in the floor of the
&gt;bus above the fuel tank area and replace the sender
&gt;that way. Who cares about the structural integrity of the van, that fact
&gt;that the road and motor sounds and fumes will begin
&gt;to inevitable pollute the bus through this hole.

[...]

With holes throughout the floor, awash in road and motor sounds and fumes,
