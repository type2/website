Subject: Re: [T2] OT Friday float.

&gt;  there is a new beetle floating in the flooded street.
&gt;however it was not running and not going anywhere.  so I guess the new
&gt;ones aren't as usefull as their older cousins.

	I doubt they float at all, whereas the good old proper Beetle 
was depcited in newspaper pix as floating very well  -  as a result, 
vaguely believed to be practically an amphibian.  I believe it 
inspired Terry Buckley's genuine amphibian; his patents were bought 
up by A Gibbs who perverted them into the unfortunately heavy 
Aquada.; but Terry has returned to his original line of development 
of a *light* amphibian.
