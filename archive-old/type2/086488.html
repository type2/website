Subject: brake saga continues,,, this time with pictures!

Hello again all, and infinite thanks for the help thus far... I am very
grateful to have such a great resource,
I only hope to pass along what I learn eventually....

So I am stuck on this step of what to attach the emergency brake lever to
the shoe with...
Of course I prefer the Pin and Clip system, if that was how it was done
originally, just have to see who may have that part in stock around here.

I took some pictures of the project at it's current stage, take a look if
you'd like. I would appreciate any tips, suggestions, comments or general
tomfoolery you can shed on the subject.. the pictures have some descriptions
of what's what, as well as some shots of some of the hardware I have picked
up for the project...

http://shop.auctionwatch_dot_com/ChristopherAW/home.html - Just click on the
'brake project' link within. Nothings for sale, its just a easy way to store
some images for free. =)

Christopher
