Subject: Re: [T2] putting an end on rust; my type 2 can last 4 ever

Not imposible

&gt; The galvanizing process would require the whole vehicle to be stripped
&gt; to bare metal--everywhere--no paint left in a nook or cranny 

Difficult, can it be done?

&gt; and then
&gt; immersed in a couple of plating tanks wash, zinc, and wash again---and I
&gt; don't think that there is any tank's anywhere that is big enough to
&gt; handle a whole vehicle--or a hanger to handle it.

Any VW factory (and most car factories) must have one: most cars are
galvanized these days (with very good results)


&gt; A bigger job than any one man could do in lifetime.

I'm hoping it's possible:

- my (factory galvanized) Nissan Micra is 10 years old and it has no
rust on it regardless of all the sand, rain and salty wind it has taken
(it has always been parked outside and mostly by the sea)

- VW buses have a tendency to rust away, people spend thousands in
bodyworks and paint jobs always knowing that rust will catch up in a few
years

Don't have much spare time but the money I save from NOT smoking and NOT
driving a car everyday I use for fun so I have plenty to spend on my bus
:)

I'll probably be around for 50 or 55 years more and I feel I'll need my
bus more as I get older. Don't want it to start rusting and leaking when
I, at the age of 90, weak, half deaf and half blind, go live on it. (I
know I could live on the Micra but I like the sound of the boxer engine
better)
