Subject: Stranded ... Bus won't run.

Hello all,

I have had my bus (my first car) for 5 years now and she has been
great.  I have signed on and off of the list for about half that time
and have received a huge amount of help from all you folks.  So, I am
back this time to ask for help diagnosing the most serious problem
which I have had to deal with yet.

By the way, Minnie is a 1972 Kombi with a 1976 2.0 Litre engine which
I bought from a mechanic who got it from a friend who SAID it was
recently rebuilt.

I just got back from a road trip down to the US, during which all
2000+ miles the bus performed perfectly.  When I was only 30 minutes
from my front door, the oil light popped on.  I pulled over, checked
and added oil, looked and listened for anything unusual, and continued
on my way, sans oil light.

A little while later the engine started stuttering, especially when I
would press the accellerator a little too hard.  Pulled over, checked
and adjusted the timing, and continued on.  The hesitating, jerking,
stuttering continued very intermittently, but wasn't bad, so I
continued home.

I got home safe, but instead of parking and working on her as I should
have, I continued to use her as normal.  She began to stutter and jerk
under load consistently for a day.  Then yesterday after a normal
drive into town, she just died (luckily in front of a friend's house).

So, what I've done is this: replaced cap, rotor, points, condenser,
coil, and oil filter and I checked the fuel pump by turning over the
engine and watching gas spurt out the line.

Now I'm thinking it may be the valves.  Perhaps they're out of
adjustment or a valve has gotten stuck?  She'll start, but run very
very rough, not on all cylinders for sure, and won't drive under any
load whatsoever.

The van is kind of stuck in town right now, and I live 20 minutes
away, so I'd like to figure this out soon.  I'm also a very poor
student right now and would like to save as much bread as possible,
but am willing to shell out for something if it's worth it.

Thank you so much for contributing to this community, I feel comforted
knowing it's around and I'm ready to contribute the little knowledge
I've gained over the last few years.
