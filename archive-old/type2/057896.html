Subject: Pre Manassas VA Bugout Party (September 5th)

Hi Volks -

As customary (at least for the last few years), I'm hosting an afternoon
get together of volks folks at my house the day BEFORE (September 5th,
that is) the Manassas Bugout this weekend.  So if you plan to be rolling
into the area the day before the big show, you are invited to join us.

In past years we've camped out at local campgrounds afterwards, but this
time we're just going to cruise up to Manassas in the early evening and
checkout the happenings at the hotels/motels where everyone hangs out.  

I'm also offering up &quot;camping&quot; space in my driveway if anyone wants to
spend the night and join our eratz club in the early morning as we once
again claim &quot;inside the wire&quot; parking at the show. 

Here are the particulars:

Date:  September 5th (Saturday)
Time:  1pm until whenever
Location:  Montclair VA (approx 12 miles away from the Bugout site). 
RSVP to me (Busickr_at_erols_dot_com) and I'll send detailed directions.

What to bring: You, your VDub, and your own beverage of choice.  If you
want...bring something to share with the group, but this isn't required.

I hope you'll join us.  Steve Dolan....Mr. List himself....the man
behind the administrivia......&quot;may&quot; join us.......he's even promised to
bring an extra coil (we'll explain that on Saturday).

Bye.  Bob
