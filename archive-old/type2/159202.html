Subject: Re: [T2] Yet another Not-a-new-bus

&gt;Not to mention the electronics involved with just ABS that has
&gt;morphed into electronic suspensions and drive by wire systems...
&gt;  
&gt;
All dandy until 10 yrs from now when it's got some miles on it... I had 
a friend with an adjustable suspension (sport, touring, medium?). 
Shockes were about $500 each and no aftermarket replacements...

&gt;Now in my personal life I'm selectively luddite, 
&gt;

Oh yeah, I love the gadgets as much as any other person...

&gt;I'm on another list, and a former Volvo engineer bemoans the
&gt;Ford takeover...Essentially, Ford supplies Volvo with their junk
&gt;(his term) and expects Volvo to use it AND expects Volvo
&gt;to maintain its reputation for safety and reliability... ;-)
&gt;  
&gt;

WHAT? You are interested in something besides Type 2's?

I would consider buying a Honda or Toyota loaded with technology. 
Consider it. If I was buying a domestic I would only consider a pickup 
truck circa 1949 BUT with the in-cab gas tank moved outback under the 
bed (truck gets rear-ended, in cab tank ruptures along the top seam, 
spews gasoline un the rear cabwall, centrifugal force sends it across 
the ceiling, and then down on the electrified dash... Friend used to 
crash test cars in the 1960's, I sold my '49 Chevy soon afterwards, 
unrealted reasons... &lt;grin!&gt;)

Seriously anything domestic is best kept simple.
