I just got back the run down on parts from bus boys and even though the 
prices are high it is the history that is priceless so I'm thinking real hard 
about stripping it down to bare metal and doing it right.  Some of the people 
want the bus slapped together for a maiden voyage home and that just doesn't 
flow well in my bloodstream.  The highest offer has been out of Sweden right 
now at around $2000 us dollars and it sounded like some rich kids play toy to 
be chopped and customized and for some reason the little man on my shoulder 
keeps saying do the homework and restore this bus back to its first working 
day.  all else is moving slowly and tomorrow I take  the 6 volt gear off and  
take it  down to Bosch and let them test it all to determine if staying 6 
volts is in the cards for the bundesbeast.  I'll keep ya dated.  
Peace Out
