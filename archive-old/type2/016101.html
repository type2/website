Hiya Dan,

Anything you do to make the old Bus a more uninviting target will help.  And 
in that sense, the Club or devices like it do deter theft.  But if the guy 
who picks your bus to steal is determined.....................well, the Club 
sure isn't gonna stop him.  All he has to do is cut the steering wheel with a 
set of bolt cutters and that thing slips right off.
Most of the folks I've talked to advocate the use of a visible deterrent such 
as the Club along with another hidden system.  Most often mentioned as a 
hidden system is a hidden kill switch.  This switch will disable your primary 
ignition circuit while you are out of the car.  So, if the guy does pop your 
window and cut your wheel, he's not going anywhere.  Leaves you open to 
stereo ripoff, but you still have the Bus.  Just be careful where you put the 
switch - these guys are wise to this trick.  But they will not spend a great 
deal of time trying to find that switch.

Mike
