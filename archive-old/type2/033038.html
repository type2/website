Subject: Engine Number

1. Could someone please decipher what year engine I have. The number is
CB056530.

I'm also installing a Weber 32/36 carb into the bus, it's what was in their
so I figured go ahead and have the same. The old one was shot so I got a new
unit. So a few questions regarding it.

2. On the back of the mounting stand their is a place for the brake booster
line, mine is currently under the bus not hooked up. Should I hook this
brake booster line back up?

3. No auto choke power line has been left, I have found two cut lines that
run with the bundle cable to the coil. Since my engine should have
originally had two carbs would these more than likely be the auto choke
power? Following the wiring diagram it seams to be.

4. I had a hard time finding a local FLAPS that had spark plug wires, I did
find a set for $30.00 does that sound right, expensive. The lines didn't
match perfect to the ones I took off but didn't know if this would be a
problem. Will this cause any problems?

Thanks to any and all that can help.
