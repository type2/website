Subject: Unleaded fuel

Good Morning (well, it is here in South Australia)

I have had my Type 2 '82 2L FI aircooled campervan for nearly a year now,
and have already done some short trips around the coast, just a few hundred
miles each time.  She is showing her age (about120,000 miles), but runs
pretty well.  So far, have replaced rear wheel bearings, CV joints and a
gearbox main bearing.

The bus reminds me more than a little of the '62 split window bus I owned
in the 60's - it still feels like a vcehicle designed by a mechanical
engineer rather than a marketing computer.

Here is my question:  in Australia we will find it hard or very expensive
to use unleaded fuel after the year 2000.  The mechanic I use here tells me
the engine is not really designed for unleaded, although he could import
different valves, an upper cylinder lubricant injector and a catalytic
convertor...  Heck! ...

What do you do about this in the northern hemisphere?

Cheers,

Bob Bolton
