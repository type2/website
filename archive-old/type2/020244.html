If the beam is rusted, tow it with the front wheels on the dolly, or rent
U-Haul's auto transport - gets all 4 wheels off the ground. If you do go with the
dolly, take the time to disconnect the axles - it won't take you that long if you
purchase the proper tools.

&gt; I'll be bringing my &quot;new&quot; '77 Westy home Saturday, and since the front beam
&gt; has serious rust it will have to be towed. Commercial tow is going to run
&gt; nearly $200.00 (flatbed truck, 58 miles), so I am debating whether or not to
&gt; rent a U-Haul tow dolly ($40.00) and use my Chevy van to tow it home. Tow
&gt; with front wheels off the ground or rear?
