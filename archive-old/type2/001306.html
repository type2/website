OK:
So I went out to the garage, scratched my head a bit, done me some
pondering, and it finally came to me -- the bus doesn't have to be level to
make this adjustment. Easier if it is, but usually not possible BECAUSE YOU
HAVE THE REAR END UP ON JACKSTANDS! This may have been obvious to most, but
not to me. Reading the Bentley you might think you make the initial
measurement with the bus on the ground. Not necessarily so. You can't make
the measurement until you have the spring plates off their lower stops, and
you can't do that without taking off the rear wheels etc., and it would be
mighty tough to do that without having the bus on stands, which tends to
throw the whole thing off level.

Duh.

Tomorrow, look for my investigation into why it seems to get light every
morning.
Bob
