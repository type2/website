Subject: Re: [T2] timing mark on fan

It is true that hotter temps are a consequence of excessive advance,
but I don't think 50 degrees F or C is a realistic expectation for
each degree of timing. The VW distributor specs themselves allow for a
wide range of acceptable advance figures, and if so sensitive, you
would not be able to be a degree or two off when you do timing.

 I've heard it said that for every degree that timing
 is advanced, you get a 50 degree increase in head
 temperature.  It is very important that the timing be
 set correctly for the engine to run cool.  True??  KR
