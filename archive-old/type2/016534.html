Subject: Pulling exhaust manifiold

People:

On a '78 and a '79 with a type IV engine, is it possible, but difficult,
to replace the exhaust manifold pipes while the engine is still in the
VW??  If answer is YES and difficult, would you recommend dropping the
engine a tad to get at the exhaust studs?

Please respond to Paul Roberts, below, who has incoming, but no outgoing
mail capabilities at the moment.
