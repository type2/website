CG,

    Don't forget the rest of your 1950's accessories! Fender skirts,
teardrop spot lights, fuzzy dice, coon tail, and the ever popular &quot;Blue-dot&quot;
tail lamps.
    I also have a large can Royal Crown for sale, if your Pompadour is a
little limp. See you at the sock hop, Daddy-O!

ps: Volkswagen horn buttons ground the horn to complete the circuit. You
could use this same idea to work your horn through a relay to send power to
your horn instead of ground. This way no aftermarket horn buttons on the
column or dash etc.
    Using a junk yard relay, a little wire, and a couple connectors, it
could be done for next to nothing dollar wise.
    If you want to try it E-mail me off list, and I will send you a simple
diagram.

Tommy
