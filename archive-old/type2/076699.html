Subject: Snake oil cooling info???

------=_NextPart_000_0017_01C173F7.5F3045C0
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

After reading the article in January VW Trends regarding an engine =
mini-sump filter (page 68), I had a few questions that maybe someone out =
there could answer.
1. Has anyone tried these out?  If so Did it work well for additional =
oil filtering and did it really help cooling to any appreciable degree?  =
In your opinion was it worth the cost?  What was the cost?
2. On an older topic of cooling - I recently read again (somewhere I =
can't remember) that the cast aluminum valve covers will help keep the =
engine cooler than original covers.  I also remember in a forum that =
someone said the original valve covers worked just as well and that the =
cork gaskets served to insulate the cover from much of the engine heat.
Any thoughts on this?
