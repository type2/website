Subject: Table hold-down clamp

  Does anyone know where I can buy the little molded plastic piece
that screws to the back of the folding table and clamps around the
bracket to hold table in place?  It always seems to break easily,
much like the sun visor holder piece.  If they are not available, does
anyone know where I can find some hard rubber (like motor mount
rubber) so I can try make the a piece to do the 'clamp the table in
place' job?  Thanks.
  If anyone needs to make the rubber weather guard strip that fits on
the inside of the rear bumper where it folds around the rear corners
of your bus, I have made one that I think does a pretty good job and
will be happy to share the information with you.  I will be away until
Jan 3rd, so p-mail me and I will respond when I get back.
