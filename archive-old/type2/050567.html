Hi,

&gt; Just want to point out that points  &quot;breaking&quot; has NOTHING to 
&gt; do with the
&gt; CDI, it is totally irrelevant. It just seems like where the 
&gt; &quot;con&quot; is placed
&gt; it's because of the CDI, and this is not correct.

 This is true- sorry if I've mislead anyone. I was comparing
the Pertronix to the CDI and trying to point out (sorry... )
that while the solid state points may not be perfectly reliable,
the old mechanical ones can also fail. Fitting the CDI without
the Pertronix (or other points eliminator) does get you
most of the benefits of electronic points but not all.

 When I reread the post it occurred to me that I hadn't made
it as clear as I intended that the CDI is probably the most
cost-effective solution. If you can afford both then by all
means get them (as I did) but on balance the CDI on it's own
probably offers more than the Pertronix does. I think Bob 
Hoover was of this opinion, too, which ought to carry a damn
sight more weight than my claim!

Cheers,
