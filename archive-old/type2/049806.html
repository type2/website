Gentlepersons-
                       I've had the same sort of problem on another car and 
the solution was to
&quot;bench bleed&quot; the master cylinder before installing it. A new or rebuilt unit 
should come
with one or two plastic lines to ensure the unit doesn't have any trapped air 
in it that
ordinary bleeding may not remove. The plastic lines come off the outlets and 
feed back
into the reservoir.
