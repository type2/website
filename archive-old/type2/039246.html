Subject: EGR Re-Set

Jay, the re-set for your EGR should be on the EGR/O2sensor mileage counter, 
located just to the left of the accelerator cable cover, mounted to the 
drivers side main frame beam. The re-set button will be caked with desbris, 
due to its rather &quot;interesting&quot; location. Look for the two wires that lead 
out of the counter and up, into the van, at the front. This is yet another 
reason that I've switched back to Type 2's, as they were good enough to 
locate the afore mentioned re-set button in a much more civilized location.
