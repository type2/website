So, It looks like the change from latches to screws may have been a mid year
change. The 69 I got my cabinet out of had the latches. It also had the 68
style Mirror (long chrome,2 screws). But the vin was right for a 69. (2X9) I
am sure that Westfalia did not follow Model year changes strictly unless
required to by a change in body design. So they may have made changes mid
year if they saw a need, the number were small enough to be able to do that.
I have also heard of people with a 72 Bus (old bumpers, low front indicator,
etc.) with a 73 Model year Title. Westfalia lagged a little behind.

&gt; 		What year did they start installing the rear shelf above the
&gt; bed? I have seen a 69 and a 70 without it, my 71 has it, so 71?

Optional through 73, I think.

I've seen 68's with nets and 68's with shelves...seen 73's with nets and
with shelves.

&gt; 		The side cabinet at the front is held in by latches up to
&gt; 70? The 69 has the latches and my 71 has screws as well as the 72 and 73 I
&gt; have looked at.

My 69 had screws.
