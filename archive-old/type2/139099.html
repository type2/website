Subject: Tuning 72 bus

After a few delays (xmas, rain, misc) I've got the AVP engine in the 72 bus
and started to tune it up. I'm having two problems:

- the dashpot is raising the idle and it takes too long return to idle from
any throttle position even with it adjusted all the way back. Removing it
completely actually seems to work best under these conditions. Ideas?

- I have to crank the engine quite a bit and use the gas pedal to get it to
start. Once it starts, it accelerates and drives normally. What is the
normal amount of time required to start the engine? If the pedal required?
