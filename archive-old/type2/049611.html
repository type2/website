Subject: Re: [T2] Where are cheap + cool campsites

Buy the book &quot;Camp Anywhere in the U.S. for $5 or less&quot;.  There's
eastern versions and western versions (which the eastern is long out of
print).  I spent 3 months touring from the Rockies west and paid for 1
campsite.  Granted, we drove 30 miles out of the way, but It was free
and most were totally desolate.  Stayed in some great places because of
that book.
