Subject: Re: [T2] UPDATE: Re: Vacuum leak check

mine is acting very wierd, it has never stalled, starts right up but
occasionally and very intermittently with no pattern I've found loses
power, sort of like when a fuel filter is clogged.  (FI)  in fact changing
out the filter (twice) was the first thing I did..

right at the moment I have fuel presure line run to the front with a guage
on the dash, but the dern thing shows numbers that look like they are
right out of Bentley with presure still in the system to days after
shutting it off.... so unless an injector is intermittently clogging or
not firing I don't see anything else in the fuel system, have checked
electrics and vaccuum many times,,...  like I said my next step is to find
a .009 I know I have in the garage somewhere and stick it in to double
check the entire dizzy system.

thanks
Bob

&gt; mine has  about 30,000 on it but I am having a intermittent loss of power
&gt; problem  that is driving me nuts,  has anyone heard of a Pertronix that
&gt; acted  up intermittently??  I've always heard they either work or they
&gt; don't  work nothing in between.   now as soon as I can find that .009  I
&gt; know is in the garage I think I will do a entire dizzy swap to see if  that
&gt; has an effect....

&gt;
&gt; hey Bob  I had one that acted up like that. I was thinking that the  bus was
&gt; vapor locking and it turns out it was the pertronix  later   Mark Dearing
