&gt;hey all,
&gt;I may be dreaming, but I'm just curious.  How would one go about fitting
&gt;disc brakes on the rear of his '78 bus?  Would it be possible to go to
&gt;the junkyard, steal the front rotors from a late bus and slap them on
&gt;the rear of my bus?

No.

&gt;Is this a bolt-up or are there other
&gt;considerations?  Where would the caliper mount?  What about the master
&gt;cylinder?  Would it have to be changed?

The caliper would be the easy part.  Try mounting the rotor.

I don't know anything, but I suspect it would be more trouble than it's worth.

&gt;This will probably never happen as it would be $$$expensive but I hate
&gt;jerking around with drum brakes.

So do I.  Or rather, I hate not having really good brakes.  One thing I've
thought of doing is removing the proportioning valve.  This valve limits
the braking ability of the rear brakes to approximately half of the front.


Now, I know there will be a few of you who will say, &quot;Don't do this!!!!
It's dangerous, the rear brakes will lock up and you'll spin out!&quot; but the
my bus has 1100 pounds over each rear wheel and even with some major weight
transfer I don't think the rears will lock up.  Ever.  One of these days
I'm gonna try it.
Or, I may put in an adjustable proportioning valve.  These are only about
$40 and have a high coolness-factor.

I'm also gonna see if they list Performance Friction Carbon metallic pads
and shoes over at Auto Zone.  I have these on the Mustang, and they are
great.  If they stock them for the bus, I might just have to celebrate.
