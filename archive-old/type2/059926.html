Subject: Dead engine No. 4 and insurmountable VW frustration

This is about a '69 Westi.  1600DP, '71 trans.

Yes, you read that right, folks.  

Dead engine #4 in two years.

Granted, the first one was all my fault, but the subsequent three have all
been unexplained.. A dropped valve(#2), poor machine work(#3), and God
only knows(#4).  I guess at this time there's only one that's unexplained.

The skinny:  1,000 miles on a robust rebuild.  I pulled the engine at 800
to check torque, all is well.  Put it back together, drove it hither and
yon for 200 miles (about a week), then put it back up to redo the back
brakes.  The operation was successful, I drove it around a few times.
Never gave even a hint of what was to come...

So I take it out Saturday to blow the cobwebs out of it, get a little
fresh air and let the dog ride shotgun.. I get to the top of my hill (1/4
mi) and it starts to lose juice.  Great, I say, crap in the carb.  I push
in the clutch and it dies.  Turn the key, and *click*...uh-oh.

So I let out on the clutch in second, ever so gentle-like.  She pulls me
to a screeching halt with the rear wheels locked up tight!  _at_#$#_at_$!

Just as I was sitting there conversing with the dog over the gravity of
this present situation and pondering which tow company to jerk me home,
over the hill comes another bus fanatic, Howard, in his Ni**an St*nza.  He
offers to bump me home so off we go.  I am still amazed how much power
that little car has. :)

So.  I come to the crossroads once again of which cliff to push this thing
off of.  Anybody got any ideas?
