Subject: Bad smell on compression (1971)

My 1600 DP engine, all stock, has a bad odor. When I come to the top of a
hill or if I need to slow down just by lifting my foot from the gaz pedal, a
smell of fuel and oil comes from the heat ducts. The 2 heat box are old but
tight. It never smell when the engine is propulsing me. Just when I slow
down, on the compression.

I cant find why!! Rings, exhaust, heads. The 2 differences are Trottle
closed and wheels driving the engine.

Des idées? Any clues?
