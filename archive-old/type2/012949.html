First get extended liability insurance (to protect our guardrails). Next
get a really good seatbelt. Then try the impossible find a 180 BHP
Chevrolet Corvair, they come in two varities: Turbo charged 1965/66, or
62/64 Four Carb models. I could never keep a clutch in my Corvair Turbo
but I think it'll get you up to 90 MPH. This stock engine had a forged
steel crank that was very durable, but remember you're back to one fan
belt for cooling the engine.

&gt; &gt;In case you haven't noticed, the front of a Bus is shaped like a 
&gt; brick
&gt; wall.
&gt; &gt;In order to get a Bus to go 90MPH without straining the engine, 
&gt; you'll need
&gt; &gt;many hundreds of horsepower...so yeah, a Winston Cup race engine 
&gt; will
&gt; &gt;probably do it. Maybe.
&gt; 
&gt; I have a photo of the spedometer in my 78 westy _at_ 86mph with a stock 
&gt; 2.0
&gt; litre engine. Its possible. It wouldn't take much of a grade before 
&gt; this
&gt; dropped.
&gt; 
&gt; This is pretty hard on the engine, and its not the securest ride in
&gt; the world :)
