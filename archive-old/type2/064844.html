Subject: Re: Kendall motor oil

I happen to have used Kendall almost exclusively in my '73 Beetle
and it tended to run anywhere in the neighborhood of 20-30 
degrees cooler than my current '69 westy with Mobil.

I always run SAE 30 wt in summer and 15w40 in winter.  This helps
my poor weak battery and 27 year old starter do well all the time
.  Never had any complaints about Kendall, motor burned much less 
oil with it than with Castrol (Yuck.)

BTW, just fyi, Castrol does not own their own refineries, but 
rather buys oil from anywhere that's cheapest at the time.  Maybe
OK....but I take no chances. (Engineered for smaller cars? Gimme
a break.)

We even asked a castrol company representative where their 
refineries were located, and he was speechless. We also told him 
we'd distribute Syntec if he demonstrated the commercial (drain
oil, start car) on his own ride.  He refused, we said have a nice
day.

Just my HO.
