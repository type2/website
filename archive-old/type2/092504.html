Subject: bus transmission

--=====================_19159760==_.ALT

I was thinking about swapping out transmissions in my 74 single cab for 
something with a little more top end speed.  I've got a 1.7L type IV engine 
in it and was wondering what transmission would be an easy swap?  There's 
an 091 on Eb*y right now but I don't know if it will fit.

Right now the truck runs great at 55 mph, but I'd like to be able to get it 
up to 60-65 without it sounding like I'm killing it!  Does anyone have any 
recommendations pro or con?  My current transmission leaks and I'd also 
like to change the rear shift rod bushings, so I'm not violently opposed to 
removing my current transmission anyway.  Thanks!  Greg
