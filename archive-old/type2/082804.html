Subject: Re: [T2] Spark Plug Wires

Bob, do you have ignition noise?  I've found very little if any on my '71
with a 706, AH-4, stock Bosch wires and BP5ES NGK plugs.  I usually run 6,
40, and 80m on the 706.

&gt; I guess I am wondering about the quality of the wire that one might get as
&gt; a part of a &quot;total supply&quot;.
&gt;
&gt; Also, I plan to do some Faraday (noise) shielding of the dizzy, plugs, plug
&gt; wires, and other electrical components so as to keep ignition and
&gt; electrical noise out of my installed ham radio boxes.
