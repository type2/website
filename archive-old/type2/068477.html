Subject: Trim Paint, the Right stuff

I was intending to buy some generic rust compatible semi-gloss black 
spray paint to do the door handles on my '80 and lumber rack on my 
truck.  Went to a GOOD paint shop, who caters to the pros.  Talked to 
them about my intentions and got straightened out.  There is a paint
MADE specifically for this application.  It has a tad more acid in the mix 
to give it a better *bite* into the aluminum, plastic, whatnot to adhere 
better.  Beats having it peel in a couple of years.  No primer needed.  
Will also use it on my rusting steel lumber rack.  Couple of bucks more 
though.

There also is a paint made specifically for the flexible rubber 
bumper materials, for those *other* cars.

I can here you earlier type 2er's out there snickering.

What? PAINTED metal stuff, wha's tha', hummpfh, s'posed to be chrome.
