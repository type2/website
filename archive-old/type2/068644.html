&gt;Hi all,
&gt;
&gt;I am just wondering if anyone has come up with good ideas for locking the
&gt;engine hatch.

Every once in a while I come across locking latches in the junkyard.  You
can have them rekeyed to match the rest of your locks fairly cheaply.  If
you want a new one, Vee Parts in San Diego has them (619-447-4787) but they
are around $60.
&gt;
&gt;I would also be interested in anyone's ingenious ideas for making the contents
&gt;of their bus more secure.

The best way is to make them invisible.  I got cleaned out once when I left
some valuables in plain sight.  Now everything is hidden.  No obvious
speakers, stereos, tools, etc.  Never had a problem since.
