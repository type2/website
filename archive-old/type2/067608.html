&gt; Subject: Vanagon heat shield?
&gt; 
&gt; I made a trip out to Jim Ellis VW in Atlanta today to see if I could still
&gt; buy all the various grommets, boots and any other seals etc that I'm missing
&gt; from my engine compartment. First time that I've seen a parts fiche which the
&gt; counter man let me peruse and point out missing items. I id'ed a half dozen
&gt; items which cost a $20 bill and a weeks wait to come from Jacksonville, Fl.
&gt; Hopefully plugging the holes will make a significant difference.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, the reason for writing is that while studying the diagrams, I noticed
&gt; something that looked like a narrow shelf over the muffler and under the tin.
&gt; The parts guy guessed that it may have been a heat shield protecting the
&gt; engine tin from the muffler heat. I don't have it but then I have none of the
&gt; original equipment beyond the heater boxes. Was that the purpose of this
&gt; piece and if so, would it aid cooling to rig a shield over the muffler?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,

I have the  narrow shelf that your talking about. I was told that it protects the engine from flying debris, some kind of stone protector. Now that you mention it I think the guy might be right and that it is a heat shield as the construction is like a sandwhich, the filling being what looks like asbestos type material! (Its also in a strange place for stone protecting!!)

On the point of &quot;buying the various grommets&quot; what response did you get. I'm looking for rubber and plastic parts myself. A recent problem saw the end to my fan cage and generator surround. Is there a &quot;plastics and rubber kit for old busses&quot; available any where?! If you no what I mean :)

Best
Ian
