Believe it or not, this can actually be done!  Houses are normally
supplied with three wires from the power company.  Two of these wires are
&quot;hot&quot; and 180 degrees out of phase with each other.  The third wire is
neutral.

Connect between either of the hot wires and neutral and you'll get 110V.
Connect between the two hot wires and you'll get 220V.

Now, most houses use both hot wires and attempt to balance the load, which
means that some 110V outlets are attached to one hot wire and some are
attached to the other.  If you poke around a bit with a voltmeter, you can
often find two outlets whose hot sockets are measure 220V between them.

Now, I don't recommend this as a usual thing to do, but it did get a 220V
air conditioner working in a supposedly 110V-only apartment back in my
college days!
