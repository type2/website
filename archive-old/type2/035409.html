Subject: Fwd:  Electric fan cooling proposal

 Hi,

&gt; I would like to get some feedback on this. Feel free to offer any
help you
&gt; can give.

 I think that your proposed electric fans will not deliver sufficient
air
under real world conditions and that you should carefully consider the
fact that an electrical fault (the most common type of breakdown) is
likely to cook your engine.

 I'm also not clear what the benefit would be. What do you need access
to
frequently enough to warrant the effort that this will require?

 Sorry, but you did ask...

Cheers,
	W.
