)I would suggest pulling the cooler air from below, through the cooler.
Reverse the air flow, and you're fighting the natural convection process.
You will draw heat downward into the cooler, while it is trying to rise
upward.  My '70 has A/C condenser fans mounted beneath her, and they do the
same thing.

&gt; Should it PULL the air from the small pocket above the cooler through 
&gt; the cooler, therebye SUCKING the heat away from the cooler,
&gt; Or should it PUSH the ambient air from under the bus through the 
&gt; cooler and up into the pocket above the cooler?
