I second the motion that the 78 doesn't have one!

&gt; Gotta disagree with Tom on this one.

&gt; VW had an off/on love affair with throttle valve switches (I am speaking of
&gt; the full-throttle switch on the throttle body here).  I believe they were on
&gt; at the beginning but I also know for sure that '78 doesn't have them nor
&gt; does my '79 federal model.
&gt;
&gt; I remember my '81 having it though.  All the thing does is close when full
&gt; throttle comes around so the computer knows to enrich the mixture a little
&gt; bit.  But not all years have them.

&gt; &gt; Throttle valve switches were on the air-cooled FI Type IV's right from the
&gt; &gt; git-go and continued on through the Vanagon.  I don't know what
&gt; &gt; year(s)/model(s) go with your ECU #'s, but they all incorporated throttle
&gt; &gt; valve switches.
