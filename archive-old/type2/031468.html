&gt; Hey. I'm thinking of getting the local national chain exhaust shop to 
&gt; make me some J-tubes for my 77's stock exhaust. The tubes would replace 
&gt; the heat exchangers and the elbows that connect them to the manifolds. 
&gt; Anybody else had any experience with this type of cheating?

yeah I did it for my 78, 2L.... the entire heat system was shot, so
whipped up a new heat system using a BA4 put it up front under the pan and
recirulate the heat from inside.

made the J tubes by chiseling off all the heater box stuff!  (those heat
sinks are a real PITA to get off)  has worked fine for a number of years,
although I did remove the cable from the thermostat, mainly because I
wasn't sure it would open with the tin surround gone.
