If anyone is looking for a solid Westfalia Deluxe, i'm taking my 1979 down 
to BugJam in DadeCity Florida this weekend. It sat since 1989, so the FI 
systems needs looking at. I have had it running with starter fluid though. 
Engine has just over 30,000 miles on a rebuild and brakes were done the last 
year it was driven. Interior is in excellent shape. Canvas needs replaced.  
3500 obo.._dot_cash talks. Possible delivery, but we will talk about that later.
