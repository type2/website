Subject: Re: gas smell

&gt;It is the strangest thing. The [gasoline] odor seems to be most
&gt;prominent in the FRONT of the bus.  There is absolutely NO gas
&gt;odor in the engine compartment.

Well, if you only smell gas in the cab, then it must be leaking out of the
fuel guage. ;)

Okay, there are many junctures that involve rubber tubing between the point
where you put gas into the side of the bus and the carb where the gas ends
up. One of those junctures is leaking. If you don't smell it in the engine
compartment, it argues that the leak is on the front (FIF) side of the
firewall.

Perennial favorites are the tube just after the fill tube (a big mother and
impossible to get, people improvise with large radiator hoses and
suchlike), and overflow vent tubes (this was just gone through here on the
list).

It's a cracked rubber hose somewhere, maybe somewhere where you can't see
it, and you're gonna have to find it. Get some concentration and a hand
mirror and a flashlight and start tracing the route of the gasoline.
