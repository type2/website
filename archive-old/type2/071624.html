Subject: Ghetto Cruiser Update - Dope Sound System
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

&gt;&gt;For those of you who forgot, the Ghetto Cruiser is my 1972 VW Westfalia
&gt;&gt;Campmobile.

I am thinking about this fine selection because I have no money, but want
great sound.

Front Door Panels: 3 1/2&quot; Alpine Speakers with a real tweeter, not a whizzer.

Rear Hatchback:  5 1/4&quot; Realistic Speakers with whizzer tweeter.

Stereo: BlauPunkt Charlotte

Amp: Realistic 40 watt Amp with equalizer.

Bass kicker: Bazooka 30-watt EL powered kicker.

This setup will allow me to use my Realistic amp which recommends 8 ohm
speakers so I don't melt it down, and my Alpines and Realistic speakers are
both 8 ohms and as old as they may be, and not huge, they are excellent
brands.  I also can use my BlauPunkt stereo for CD's because it has a miniplug
in the rear, I am going to mount my portable cd-player and use that for
driving, since it has 10 second ESP, it should work well.  Let me know how
much of an idiot you all think I am, but remember, I can't afford the truly
awsome stereo I dream about, but hoping to acheive somewhere in the ballpark,
and still afford my final paintjob and restoration this spring.
Take it easy,
Capt Tripps
