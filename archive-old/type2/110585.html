&gt;&gt;If someone could give me a no BS, layman's wiring diagram in text, I'd
appreciate. From what I gather, the alternator has a separate voltage

If someone could explain the connections between A) The battery, B) The
Alternator + Voltage Regulator, C) The STARTER, and D) the IGNITION.... I'D
REALLY appreciate it.&lt;&lt;

Todd,

i'm in the same boat as you.  let me suggest purchasing a copy of the
Muir book.  the entire book is pretty much written in
&quot;layman's terms&quot;.

good luck,
