Subject: Wanted: good steering wheel '69
Message-ID: &lt;000601be9224$28af2f00$1e5a5a0a_at_DELL.HRPS.NL&gt;

For my nearly perfect '69 bus I need a new steering wheel.

The one I currently have was badly damaged when some junky smashed one of
the vent windows with a brick (this happened in Amsterdam (of course) before
I bought it). The brick landed on the steering wheel and broke pieces off.
It may be restorable but I would like to get a spare one just in case.

So ... does anyone want to part from a good condition steering wheel that
fits a '69. Please quote your price (pmail). It needs to be shipped to
Europe. I will of course pay for shipping by UPS or whatever.
