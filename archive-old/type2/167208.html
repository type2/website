Subject: Looking for western WA parts

hello list!

I have noticed in the last few days there seems to be a couple of people on 
this list in western Washington. Any of you have suggestions for places to 
get used VW parts for my two buses? I have a 78 bay that I bought for my son 
that is going to need a rear window, some front seats and the sliding hinge 
for his sliding door. The 72 westy I bought for myself is going to need a 
set of dual carbs and a front windshield. Both busses could use some sheet 
metal, and honestly I would rather cut the metal out of a wrecked bus then 
buy inferior replacement metal. I travel all day for work anywhere form 
Tacoma to Bellingham so if there is a VW-centric wrecking yard anywhere that 
anyone knows that would be most helpful. The first order of business is the 
dual carbs. I lost out on two sets at the VW show in Enumclaw on sunday for 
$200 a set. ARRRRGGHH. As a side note, Id love to see that &quot;busaru&quot; project 
some time.
