Subject: chopped bus, no title, HELP ME!!!

fellow airheads,

 heres the situation, i have a 71 westy, which i
purchased for 60 bucks. it was so far gone that i
simply chopped it. i actually sold many of the parts
to listees. however now i need the garage space for my
76 westy. i have no title for the vehicle, the lady
said she would find it and contact me (yeah, like that
even happened!) at any rate, i just want this bus
gone, out of my life!!! i will give it to anyone who
wants it, i would even pay someone to get it the h#ll
away! short of that however, i am seeking advice as to
what the most painless rought would be to disposing of
this no longer fun or useful bus. thanks in adavance
as always!!
