Subject: KYB  was deal on Boge

Hi
In the time I have had KYBs on my 78 bus, I have replaced 4 of them, all on
the rear.  They last about 6 months, and then leak all the oil out,
rendering them useless.  My 87 Jetta has been through FOUR repalcements on
the rear!!!  These cars are NOT driven hard, or off road.  IMHO, KYB makes
the car handle great.....for a VERY short time, then they go away.

I will never buy those again.  In fact, I am going to try Boge Turbo Gas on
the Jetta, and Trash the KYBs

A lifetime warranty is great, but disassembling the rear of a Jetta every
couple of months is a PITA

Just a counterpoint.
