All,
	I am having a prob with my bus.  When I turn the ignition the
starter turns over just fine, real strong.  But, there doesn't seem to be
any voltage getting to the coil.  Nothing in the engine compartment seems
to be out of place and I haven't done anything since it was working other
that charge the battery.  Any ideas?
