Subject: Re:I'm at a loss......

Ted,
    It sounds to me like the fluctuating vacuum is the problem.  Maybe try
this, remove the vacuum line from the distributor, plug it, and see if the
timing stops dancing when you run the engine.  It won't advance properly,
but just look to see if it's steady and predictable now.  If so, I guess the
vacuum really is the problem.
    Did you check the brake booster and lines for vacuum leaks too?  It
could be that, I've had that problem.
