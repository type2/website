Subject: Re: [T2] Diesel oil

If you take mostly long trips (i.e. not many cold starts) and live in a place
with mostly warm weather, and you don't want to pay for synthetic, then
staying with the single-weight oil is a very good option.  For whatever it's
worth, most piston-engine airplanes (think hot-running aircooled engines) burn
single-weight oil, SAE 40 or 50, and *all* multigrade oils sold for aircraft
use are at least semisynthetic.
