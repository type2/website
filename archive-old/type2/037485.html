&gt;Subject: '71 hardtop camper free to good home.
&gt;
&gt;Hey all,
&gt;
&gt;I got a message from my landlord stating that I need to be rid of my '71
&gt;bus. It's located in Santa Clara, CA (San Jose, south bay area). It's
&gt;in decent shape, the body has a bit of rust, but not too much, the
&gt;cabinets are pretty decent. The engine runs but could probably use some
&gt;tightening up

Don't know the laws in Ca..  but in here in Ky..  if it's registered and it 
runs..  they can't do anything. I had a similar problem with a Super Beetle 
recently..  my landlord threatened to have it towed for expired tags... 
&lt;little did they know that it had no motor but I wasn't about to tell them 
that&gt; anyway..  I convinced them to give me a week to make arrangements..   
I'd take the camper off your hands &lt;don't own one...yet&gt; but Ca is a tad too 
far away on my limited budget.

Tchuss!
