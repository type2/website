Mark, where do you live? Got a spare Z-bed in a recent stash acquisition,
and would let it go for cheap enough to let you forego crafting one, if you
can pick it up. Unless you just wanna' do it for fun of course. Mine does
need reupholstering. Marv Krupp 78 loaf/74 kinda'-Westy/72 hightop/63 1500S
