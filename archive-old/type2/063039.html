Subject: WTB: Good Non-Westy Loaf NW U.S. or B.C.

Good day all,

How's that for a specific subject line?  Well here it goes. A friend I work with wants a bus BAD.  
He will be in Vancouver Oct. 16 for about 5 days for the Who concert (lucky bugger) and wants 
to buy a bus to drive home in.  Home is Northern Alberta.  He wants a non-camperized model for 
sure and I've schooled him on the merits of all the different years and models of loafs to the best 
of my ability.  Would be leaning more towards the 76-79 bunch ( he likes the 2.0 litre motor) 
and a gas heater is pretty much a necessity up here. His price range is roughly $5000 CDN but 
could scrounge up a bit more if the right one came along. This must be a very good bus, like one 
he could drive home on short notice without having to spend time working on it down there. So 
if anyone in Northern Wash., southern B.C. area has one/knows of one/ or sees one in the next 
3-4 weeks, please let us know.  This will be the fifth fellow Forestry person I will have helped get 
a VW this summer :)  I must be earning all sorts of karma points. Thanks everyone !
