Hi, folks

Last weekend a friend and I took a day trip to Salt Creek Falls, about 60 mi 
SE of Eugene OR. My recently tuned-up VW de Mexico engine, with a Solex 
30/31 carb, did just fine: made the whole trip in 4th . . . until about the 
last 5 miles, when it began to lose power and I had to downshift to 3rd. 
That was near the beginning of a fairly steep grade, but not a noticeably 
steeper or longer one than a couple of others along the route. It ran just 
fine before and after--only that last stretch caused trouble. Eugene is, I 
don't know, maybe a few hundred feet above sea level, and the falls is 
[are?] in the neighborhood of 1500 ft. Is that enough to cause carb-related 
power loss?

All I know on the subject is Pirsig's story about forgetting to swap his 
jets for high altitude on his motorcycle. But, with all respect, this is the 
Siskyou range of the Cascades, not the Continental Divide. What do you 
think?

For the romantically trip-minded, not the classically technical-minded, as 
Pirsig would say, Salt Creek Falls is [are?] absolutely beautiful. Here's a 
site for the park itself:

But that photography doesn't begin to do it justice. Here are some beautiful 
photos by a professional photographer with whom I have no connection:

Thanks in advance for any advice about the power-loss thing.
