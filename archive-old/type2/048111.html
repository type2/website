Subject: [T2] Westfalia Owners Manual in Adobe Acrobat Format

Greetings....

Several weeks ago someone posted a copy of the Westfalia Owners Manual in
an Adobe Acrobat format.  Could whoever posted that or someone on the list
please post that address again?  I tried searching the archives, but have
had no luck.  I had printed the pages out, but I would like to have an
electronic copy as well.  It is about the closest thing I can find to
having an Westfalia owners manual for my 1969 Westfalia, as original copies
have seemed to disappear off the face of the earth (I have been searching
for an original for about a year now with no luck).

Thanks.
