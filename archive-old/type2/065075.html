This reminds me of a science exhibit I once saw at some museum (can't
remember which one). It was a table with pieces of various materials on it:
a piece of slate, a sheet of metal, and pieces of rubber, wood, and fur.
The rock and metal feel cool because they are good conductors of heat, and
they are taking your body heat from your hand. On the other hand, wood,
fur, and rubber feel warm, because they are poor conductors of heat. Water
is a good conductor of heat, and air is a poor conductor. That is why a 72
degree F swimming pool feels a lot cooler than 72 degree F air. Oil is
probably somewhere between water and rubber. John is correct that a good
conductor of heat (Kendall) would make the engine seem cooler than a poor
conductor of heat (Circle K) because it absorbs heat readily, but gives it
up readily, too. Right?

Often materials which have a great ability to absorb heat also have a great
ability to give up heat.  Aluminum is a case in point, as is anything black.
Great ability to absorb and trasmit heat would tend to make oil seem cooler
rather than hotter (it seems to me).  Whenever there is a transfer heat the rate
of transfer will depend on the difference in temperature between the two
material.  In the two cases (A) engine to oil and (B)oil to oil cooler, both are
oil to metal / metal to oil transfer.  Since the surface area in the oil cooler
is small relative to the surface area of heat transfer in the rest of the
engine.  The rate of transfer is improved by keeping the temperature difference
great by cooling the oil cooler with air.

Where I am I going with this?? beats me.   I don't think cool oil means that the
engine is running hot, though.
