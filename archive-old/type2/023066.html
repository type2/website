&gt;The type 4 engine is a well designed beast, however it was originally
&gt;designed for a 411&amp; 914, both of which are hard to kill in stock foem, and
&gt;both of which have problems ever getting the oil hot enough to rid
&gt;contaminants..

Hmmm... the last 914 I saw at the track, after a 20 minute session the temp 
gauge was pegged and the sweat falling from my face as I leaned over the 
engine compartment (Texas World Speedway, summertime) was vaporizing on 
contact with the engine case.  That car went home on a trailer the next day 
and that's not the only 914 I have seen with cooling problems at the 
track.  Sure, if you idle the car around town all day it won't overheat, 
but when pushed a 914 will overheat just like a bus.  My bus stays at 210 
around town in 100 degree heat, with the A/C on.  But a few miles of 65 on 
the freeway, or pull a big hill and up goes the oil temp.  I have a new 
engine seal and a well-tuned, low-compression motor.  Flaps and thermostat 
installed and working.  Royal Purple synthetic oil.

&gt;Face it, you have a 5,000 pound bus, most cars of that weight are V8
&gt;powered..

Very few of us have 5,000 lb busses.  A bay passenger bus weighs about 
3,000 lbs, and a camper about 3,500.  My highroof, with golf cart 
batteries, fridge, tools, camping gear, and two occupents is about 
4,000.  Jake, I know you know this already but I'm not sure everyone else 
does.  Busses aren't slow because they're heavy, it's because their engines 
lack horsepower and torque.

But I'll address the issue anyway.  Go get a Toyota truck of similar 
vintage, in well-maintained condition.  Put 500 lbs of cement in the bed 
and hook up a 1,000lb trailer - now you have another 4,000lb vehicle with a 
small 4-cylinder engine.  Drive it in the same 100 degree heat up the same 
hill.  Think it will overheat?  I would bet money that it won't.  Another 
example - my '73 Capri had a stock 100hp 2-liter engine that was far from 
high-tech.  Put that engine in a bus and it would blow the doors off of 
every stock bus on this list.  With adequate air through the radiator it 
would not overheat either.

&gt;And yes, I'm one of those guys who believes in external coolers, and also
&gt;one who shuts engines down at 235 oil temp.....Thats OK, my bus averages
&gt;185, most of the time, but it does take 7 qts to fill it up.. just wait till
&gt;it gets the dry sump, and CIS with a turbo this winter!!

A turbo sounds fun.  What do you think of nitrous?  It would seem to have 
an advantage over the other power-adders because it would help cool the 
intake charge and only be used intermittently.  Despite it's hotrod 
reputation I think it would be well suited to an air-cooled engine and is 
something I will definitely try someday.  My pie-in-the-sky dream is to 
stuff a Ford 5.0 in a bus and go cruising for the bus-disrespectors - you 
know the ones, they assume you have no power and try to overtake you in 
short spaces and merging lanes, tailgate you up the freeway onramps As If 
their Dodge Caravan were some kind of hotrod.  As for external oil coolers, 
I believe in them too, even though I don't yet have one.  It's interesting 
to note that the Porsche 911s do not have overheating problems at the track 
like their (distant) 914 cousins, and they have... drum roll please... 
Factory external oil coolers!  Hmmm, kind of makes you wonder, doesn't 
it?  But then, the 911 is truly overengineered.

BTW almost every thermostat I see is not functioning correctly, and the oil
&gt;cooler is only getting 1/2 of what it should be with proper adjustment..

Yeah I find the thermostats tend to die every few years - yet another 
poorly designed part it would seem.  Now that they are not being made 
anymore I'm not sure what I'm going to do when my current one dies.  I'm 
even considering hooking up a manual choke cable and just closing the flaps 
manually when it's cold.  Not the most elegant solution but better than 
simply disconnecting the flaps like most people will surely do.  I'm not 
sure what you mean by proper adjustment, but if the seal over the oil 
cooler is intact and the flaps are all the way open, the oil cooler should 
be getting all of the air it was designed to get.
