It probably depends on how frequently you are willing to pull your bus engine 
for head work.  The later 2 liter buses probably handle it better, but that 
has GOT to reduce the life expectancy of a poor little 1600 somewhat!!  

I suspect few of us have built engines that show no steady increase in 
cylinder head/oil temp.'s at summertime cruising speeds above 65.
