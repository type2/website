Subject: [T2] automatic transmission options

Hello all, 
I just wanted the lists opinion on my automatic transmission options.  I've 
got a 74 bus which had vacuum shift auto tranny in it, it never shifted well 
and leaked tranny fluid.  I'm upgrading from 1800 with single carb to 2.0L 
with FI and I was going to have auto tranny rebuild for $400 while motor is 
out.  I've just found a 76 automatic which is severely rusted but complete.  
The seller wants $250.  So here is my question, should I just buy this bus 
and pull the &quot;newer&quot; automatic tranny with governor and put this in my 74.  
I'm thinking I'm going to buy this bus regardless I need a gas tank to run FI 
and I wouldn't mind having FI parts lying around either.  Someone must have 
done this conversion to a newer autotranny and it doesn't look like it's a 
straight switch to me.  Would all with autotrannys agree that this is a 
definite upgrade?  Any info on the conversion would be appreciated.  I know 
that the shifter linkages are different but I'll have the buses side by side 
when attempting this.  I have no idea what sort of condition the tranny in 
the 76 is in.  The PO can't remember and the bus hasn't moved since 1989 the 
odometer shows 145000.  What should I do to tranny before putting it in my 74 
besides replacing seals?  Is there any way to bench test or check anything on 
it before hand?  Friends and family think I've lost my mind and wife isn't 
crazy about having an ugly green rotten parts bus sitting in the yard beside 
Madison (74 bus).  If I've go through with this I've told her that I'll have 
things wrapped up by March 15, 2001.  Thanks in advance and thanks to all who 
help feel &quot;normal&quot; for a few minutes each day as I read mail from list.  Mark
