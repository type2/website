Subject: Re: [T2] 76 Westy stalling at idle
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

I was having this exact same problem on my `73
transporter with a carbureted engine.  I yanked out
the carburetor and tried to clean it.  When I put it
back in it ran great.  I think I fixed a vacuum leak,
and I've seen somewhere (Bently?) suggest that this
can be a problem with stalling at idle.

Hope this helps, my ignorance of engines is surpassed
by my ignorance of fuel injection  :)

L8r,
Dano!

'76 Westy 2.0 F.I.
My bus will not idle properly after it warms up, the
revs slowly drop 
until
it stalls. It will then restart no problem., but will
not idle. The
temperatures are pretty cold here these days - could
it be condensation 
or
frozen gas line?  Anyway it only seems to happen after
its been running 
for
a while. Any suggestions are appreciated.

Thanks, Brad
