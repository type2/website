Subject: Re: pushrod tubes

to rermove cylinder head, 1.8 L :
rocker arms off
push rods out, wiggle and slide pushrod tubes out
remove cylinder tin above push rods under cylinders.
the head will hang up on head nut washers that wedge in the fins
and can be removed w/ a magnet, or yank and shake the head.
the cylinders may stick in the head and if removed w/ the head,
will expose the piston rings, which must be clamped to reinstall.
