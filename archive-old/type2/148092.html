Subject: Re: [T2] no &quot;soot&quot; in one exhaust port. Help?

My first thought is that both ports on one heat exchanger should look
the same since they are both fed by the same carb.

The one with no soot is running leaner due to an intake leak, or
hotter due to an exaust seal leak. The latter usually explains popcorn
misfiring and wrap down explosions.

Carb won't richen -- again, intake leak or worn throttle shafts.
