Subject: Re: [T2] respirator for sandblasting?

From: &quot;Chris Mills&quot; &lt;scm9985_at_tntech_dot_edu&gt;
&gt; ... One of the local sandblasters I know here used to work with no mask or
the wrong mask and gave himself some sort of poisioning. Now can hardly do
anything b/c of weakness and such...

It's a form of fibrosis, similar to the &quot;black lung&quot; that coal miners can
develop from working in the mines without proper breathing gear.  Being in
the resin casting industry, I sometimes refer to it as &quot;brown lung&quot;, &quot;resin
breath&quot; or simply as &quot;gross stupidity&quot;; owing to the similar danger from
inhaling resin dust (and I admit to having shown some occasional stupidity
on my own part in this area).

&quot;Promote proper breathing apparatuses, the lungs that you save may be your
own.&quot;
&quot;Save The Lungs (They're an important part of your environment).&quot;
&quot;A lung is a terrible thing to waste.&quot;
&quot;Breathe, it does a body good.&quot;
