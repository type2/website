Subject: Re: [T2] I need a FI Gas tank bad.....

Good thing you are not in California...... all the yards now puncture all
tanks, either with the fork of a forklift or with a pick-ax. Have to, to
satisfy EPA that they are draining them.....
The days of finding good 68-71 15 gal tanks for split buses are over ;-(

&gt; &gt; I am starting to get my new project going (78 westy 2.0) and I need a gas
tank
&gt; &gt; for this bus.  I am in the Cleveland area.  I also travel to NJ here and
there
&gt; &gt; so if anyone out there has a tank for me or knows where i can get one
please
&gt; &gt; let me know.
&gt;
&gt; The local wrecking yard has several late bay tanks still in the busses
&gt; behind the firewalls:

&gt; Busted Bus once gave me the name of a place in Arizona or Kansas (I forget)
&gt; that has gas tanks but I can't find the information.  Ask them...
