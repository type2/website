Subject: chug at low rpm

We are definitely an ac family   -  seven bugs, buses, Ghias among the four
of us.
We have rebuilt the engines on five of these and never pulled the engines
on the other two.
Here is the perplexing problem.

 The two  whose engines have never been pulled and therefore never rebuilt
make the transition off idle the way I remember vws doing when I bought
them new many years ago.  Smooth as silk with no hesitation and no
almost-dies condition if the accelerator is pressed too quickly.

For all five that have been rebuilt,   the transition off idle and at low
rpm is never smooth. It is a chugging.  One has to be generous with the
accelerator pedal to even approach a smooth take off.  But if the pedal is
punched, the engine will gulp as though it is starved of ???

This is not a clutch issue.  I've played with the accelerator pump linkage
on each engine, moving the adjustment full stroke from lots of squirt to
little squirt. I've squirted the carb linkage and manifolds  and can find
no vacuum leaks.  I've set the timing for 28 degrees at 3000 rpm but I've
not bothered to see if changing this has an effect on the problem.

As you can imagine, the rebuilder of the five (that would be me) is
suffering from low  mechanical esteem. Before I submit to expensive
therepy, can anyone suggest a reason for this chugging behavoir? There is
clearly some common mistake I'm making in my rebuild/tuning procedure.

Thanks, Jack
