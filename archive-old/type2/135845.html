Subject: Re: [T2] Prices for a valve job?

Hi Michael,

It seems to me from a few years on the list here that GEX engine have a 
typical life expectancy of 20000 miles or less. Usually a lot less. But 
I'm pretty sure there are exceptions to that rule, it's just that they 
don't get much air-play on the list since nothing is wrong with them.

My suggestion:
Drop the engine, check the end play, and have a leak down test done. 
This will tell you about the current condition of the rings and bottom 
end without getting in too deep. If the bearings are out of spec or the 
compression is dodgy you're better to find out before you sink the $$$ 
into a head replacement.

FWIW, my dad has replaced 2 heads on his 82 Westy, and they each cost 
about $1200CDN including parts and labour.

If an affordable complete engine comes along, jump on it, and rebuild 
the gex at your leisure as a spare.


Happy trails,
