the good news and the bad, 
yes there is a different ECU for auto tranny buses
but when forced to use a manual ECU for a while the only thing I noticed
was the power curve didn't always match the shift points, and the fuel
mileage was off a little.

they run better with the Right ECU, but in an emergency they will run ok
on a manual ECU
