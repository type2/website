&gt; If your engine bay is sealed properly, all air coming in is cool from

I am sorry I did not mean on the Air cooled VW scene. And Yes I did know that 
it is not a new thing. I just said its  one of the &quot; latest things &quot;. I did 
not say it was a good thing to do, it was just for information.  I am sorry I 
quoted a radial tyre instead of a cross ply.  I really upset that I quoted a 
ratio of about 80% instead of  about 82%. And I am becoming sorry I am on 
this list. PS  I don&quot;t think all this talk of a nuclear powerd bus is a good 
idea. But then again all power comes from the sun ( or so I was taught in 
school ) you see millions of years ago the sun provided the energy that grew 
the plants that eventualy became the gas you put in your VWs . And what is 
the sun but a great big nuclear device burning away in space. If I have got 
this wrong please do not reply. Mel
