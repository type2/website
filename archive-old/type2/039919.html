Subject: Help. FI AC type2 1979 VW Bus Leaking Oil after service!

My 1979 Type II bus has a serious oil leak by the looks of things.
it seems as though the 'front seal' may be shot accoring to  my &quot;keeping your VW
alive&quot; book. The book only mentions that too much oil may be the cause.

I had the thing serviced not even a week ago and it only began to leak oil
after the service. It is a fuel injected, air cooled bus and there is oil
dripping off the bottom
the engine.

The oil comes out in large amounts and forms a horrible puddle on the road. 
(usually when stopped/parked if that helps anything)

The service done was a regular &quot;tune up&quot; oil changed and tires rotated injectors
cleaned so on so fourth. I took it back to the service Depot today and they
want to charge me another $125 to fix the problem!!!!

Are they at fault? I mean, this only started after it was tuned up and the oil
level WAS above the top notch on the dipstick ( I realize the the level should
appear high initially, but it hadnt gone down below the line over the week).
Help me please! Im not that knowledgeable about repairs and I would like a
second opinion from anyone!  I need to go back and decide
whether to pay them or tell them to (politely) shove it.

Thanks in advance,
 
-Richard
