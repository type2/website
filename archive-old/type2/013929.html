&gt; Let it be known that George Lyle is a scholar and gentleman and a friend to
&gt; Volkswagens and their owners.  His diagnosis was spot on.

Gee, now I'll have to go out and buy bigger hats!  :)

Please check further to make sure that the #3 spark retardation is the true cause of your symptom.  I'd bet that it is, as your engine is 
running OK otherwise, but you should check the compression as others have suggested as well.  More info = better diagnosis!

George
