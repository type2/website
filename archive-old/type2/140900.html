Subject: Timing revisited

Hi folks,  No responses after my last post so I'm trying again...  I didn't 
get any response on the following:

&gt;Howdy,   I've got 2 buses...a '72 and a '77, both with stock engines.  I
static time my buses at 7 1/2degrees BTDC.   They've both been timed by
local shops recently and when I got home and checked the timing they both
are timed at 10degrees BTDC.  Why the difference between their strobe timing
efforts and my static timing efforts?  Should I be static timing them to 10
degrees BTDC or are they doing it &quot;right&quot; and achieving maximum performance
results?  Should I be investing in a strobe light??&lt;

        Since then I've had my '77 back in to the shop in Ptld. and inquired 
about the timing difference.  Shop manager says &quot;probably just a difference 
in timing lights&quot;.  Again,  I don't use a timing light, but static time my 
bus.  They checked things out after a left side head replacement.  When I 
got it home this time and checked the timing with my static light again, 
this time it's reading 6 degrees BTDC.
         Anyone care to comment on these discrepancies.  My eyes and static 
light don't have variations...  I'm still wondering whether I ought to 
change over to a strobe light, and now even more so since a &quot;reputable shop&quot; 
can't even seem to time it twice the same way in succession!!  Any comments 
or advice appreciated,
                                             Kevin  Snow
