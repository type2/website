&gt; So I will keep you all posted on how it holds up, but it looks pretty 
&gt; good from here.  I wonder, though, VW says 90g of grease.  Is that 
&gt; enough or should I be using more?

That is enough, of course (VW made the car and I assume they know what
they are talking about :), but I always use about twice that amount per
joint.  Basically I tend to buy a tube of the Lithium grease that fits a
gun and use the whole tube among 4 joints

&gt; Also, should I include the new concave washer or should I leave it out?

VW/Bentley says no, and after '74 they did not come with the washer, so
unless a DPO installed one, you will not find a washer in your V'gon.  I
have never installed one or reinstalled one and never regretted it.
 
&gt; Also also, should I use the clamp supplied with the boot?  This is the 
&gt; clamp that goes around the small end of the boot.  I know some folks 
&gt; have recommended not using them based on the theory that they can 
&gt; contribute to the early failure of the boot, but then if it is supplied 
&gt; with the boot kit, perhaps I should use it.

I have always tied the inner end with a nylon tie and cut it off short.

Of course this post is mostly &quot;to the files&quot;, as Sean has helped me do my
CV's in the past (even got pix of a particularly grotty one :-), so he
pretty much knows my preferences.  In addition, I must say I advised
against replacing the good boots.  I do not believe that tie/no tie makes
any difference (except maybe that tying would be *slightly* better).  I
believe it is all in the composition of the rubber, and that some batches
just last forever and others don't.  I would never replace a good boot, as
I believe that the ones with good rubber will last indefinitely, and that
the ones on the car have already proven themselves.  The ones in hand may
be as good or better, but it's a bet I don't care to take. BTW, I don't
believe that any of the vendors is trying to pull anything either.  Some
are just good and some are bad, and I have heard, on this list, stories of
bad boots from all origins.

In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. 
But, in practice, there is.
