Subject: fuse box

Does anyone out there know their fuse boxes? My 70 Westy, which had dealer 
installed air conditioning at one time, has a fuse box that looks nothing 
like any fuse box I've seen on any Westy. It's a big, white plastic affair 
that kind of dangles near my left knee. No place to screw it into, really. 
No provision for a plastic cover.  Looks sorta generic, if you ask me. Did 
they use a different fuse box on AC Westys? Did the PO rip out fuse box out 
of their '73 Impala and stick it in there?
Any and all help sincerely appreciated
