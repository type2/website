You can install an external oil cooler with an electric fan to help your low 
oil pressure problem.  If your oil is cooler it will be thicker and you will 
get higher pressure.  Also check your idle.  You can boost it a bit to 
increase the pressure.  Using the heavier weight oil also helps.

These suggestions will help you live with the problem, but may not be a 
permanent cure.  They can help a tired engine go a little further.
