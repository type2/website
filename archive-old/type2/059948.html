&gt; Hi George,
[regarding getting siezed pilot bearing off of the transmission input
shaft, freeing the engine]
&gt; Good sound advice, but you best have him keep the clutch disk
disengaged
&gt; also, that way the pilot will have a  better chance of working loose
from
&gt; the input shaft.

Arrgh!  &lt;insert sound of hand slapping forehead here&gt;

This brought back the old memory of how I did this.  

I had girlfriend sit in car with clutch fully depressed, foot on
brake, transmission in fourth gear.

I put big wrench on the pulley nut and wiggled the engine back and
forth.  The pressure plate spring pushed the engine off of the output
shaft.  No pulling on the engine was required, as the pressure plate
spring (and my girlfriend's foot) did all the work.
