Subject: Bus Sighting on the I-80 (Friday Post)

Last Sunday I was driving back to San Francisco on the I-80 (or perhaps we were still on  US-50) when the fast lane of traffic started slowing down.  We were still traveling about 65-70 mph, but a line of cars started to form in that lane and people -- in their typical fashion -- started driving like idiots, changing lanes and tailgating at speed.

I surmised (correctly) that someone was camping out in the left lane and causing this somewhat annoying and probably dangerous situation.  However, imagine my surprise when I found out that it was an early bay ('68-'71) cruising at 65-70 in the fast lane, oblivious to the world (or uncaring) and waving gleefully at people as they passed.

I got in the right lane and paused for a few seconds (flashing my lights, IIRC) to make room for the driver to get over into the right lane -- should they be inclined -- but having waited an appropriate amount of time, continued on, fairly certain they were more interested in being in the left lane than anything else.

It was a red passenger van.  I'm glad that it was on the road, but c'mon people: going the speed limit (or slightly higher) does not grant you the right to camp there when traffic is moving faster.  

Anyway, sorry for the rant, I just had to get that off my chest.  I expect a lot from bus drivers and a bit disappointed...

Cheers,
