Subject: Re: [T2] Tires?

I strongly recommend the Hancook RA08's from Bus Depot.    Even with shipping they were cheaper than a local store ordering them  and then having to pay state sales tax.  And they only charged me  $10/tire to mount and balance them.  Used tire shops are a good  candidate for that.  On the other hand, I've got Bridgestone  RD-603's on the back that are steel-belted.  I got them used for  $20 apiece.  They must have come off of the rear of some vehicle  because they have very little tread wear.  They'll probably last  as long as the Hancooks on the front.  At any rate, my bus handles  so much better than when I ran passenger car tires that it's  unbelievable.  Bite the bullit.  It just might save your  life.  JMHO....KR

    My front tires are nearly brand new, but my rear tires look really really
old. I'd like to order a set of 2 tires from Tire Rack. Do you guys have any
recommendations? And what would the optimal size be if reduction of rpms at
cruise was more important to me than acceleration?


Thanks!

Todd
