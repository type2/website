Subject: Part Number Help? Can't find it.

I have a set of heads that I am trying to Diagnose. I have looked all over 
the place and can't seem to find a matching part #.

The heads are Numbered VW 022.101.372G. Any clues? Anywhere I might check. 
If you know what the number came from I would also like your source. \

Thanks,

Michael Knight
