Subject: re:  79 bus up and running!!

Mike:

Talk about deja vu!

When I installed an AVP rebuilt long block with my original engine case in
my 79 westy a couple of years back I had the same two problems.  Upon
reassembly, I foolishly used the Haynes manual which explicitly instructs
you to put the washers between the case and the oil cooler!  Big mistake;
oil all over the ground.  LISTEN UP ALL;  THE HAYNES MANUAL IS DEAD WRONG
HERE!!!!!!!!!!

Secondly, I had the same problem with the vacuum advance interfering with
the cold start injector when rotating the distributor in the retard
direction to time the engine per the 5 degree ATDC spec ('79 cal emissions
2.0L).  The closest I could get before hitting the cold start injector was
about 9 degrees ATDC.  I tried moving the distributor drive shaft a tooth
in the opposite direction to gain clearance, but then I couldn't get enough
advance before the vacuum advance interefered with the fan housing when I
tried to get enough advance.  I tried all different tooth settings for the
distributor drive shaft and could not get a setting that would allow me to
time the engine per spec  The collective wisdom of the list was not able to
come up with an explanation or a fix.  I wound up taking the distributor to
a machine shop and having the drive shaft re-drilled so that the drive lug
at the bottom could be mounted 15 degrees from its stock position (the
equavalent of one half tooth on the drive shaft/crankshaft gearing).  To
this day, I don't know why this was necessary, but it worked.  It cost me
$100 to get it done and I've put about 12000 miles on it without trouble.

I still have the scale drawing I made for the machine shop to get the drive
lug remounted at 15 degrees.  If you need it,  let me know I can email it.

good luck,
