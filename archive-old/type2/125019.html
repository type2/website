Subject: RE: [T2] Bus Depot Code

&gt; What's the discount code for the bus depot? I searched the 
&gt; archives but couldn't find it.


It's  list1e  . Enter it in the &quot;referral code&quot; field upon checkout. The
discount is 5% on orders over $50 before shipping. It excludes
sale/bargain bin items, special order or made to order items (engines,
transmissions, heads, custom upholstery, etc.), gift certificates,
shipping fees, prior purchases, and orders on which another discount has
already been applied.
