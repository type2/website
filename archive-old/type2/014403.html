Subject: Fitting Dual Carbs on a '70

Question for the great type 2 minds...

I'm about two weeks away from scoring a 1-year old set of 40mm Kadrons
that I intend on running on my 1600 dp that lives in Speedy.  Looking
in the engine compartment this afternoon, I realized the pedestal that
the oil bath filter sits on is darn close to the engine.  Are there interference
issues with that pedestal?  Has anyone run into problems with this? 
I'm considering whacking it off if it's in the way.

Thanks,

Simon Ramirez Jr.
