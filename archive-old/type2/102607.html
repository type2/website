&gt; 1979 2.0 engines (CA only) don't have an EGR, they use
&gt; an oxygen sensor.
&gt; 
&gt; Perhaps your engine didn't originate in Cali.. which
&gt; begs the question why would this fine state wants your
&gt; smog equipment to match a non CA spec?  Maybe your
&gt; smog guy doesn't know his stuff.

It's a 76 bus with a 79 engine. Because there was no engine swap sticker the
tech wanted to smog it as a 76 bus and that year had smog equipment which
has since been removed.
