&lt;&lt;I think the statement that these carbs and the 009 distributor don't
belong on a bus is a bit erroneous. I've been running both on my '73 bus
for several years. Had a lot of trouble with it at first, but it wasn't
the carb or the distributor's fault.&gt;&gt;

I made the original statement that the bus and 009 don't belong, and I stand
by it.  I toyed with my single carb setup for about 6 years using various
combinations of jets, idle mixtures and engine timing.  My weber didn't have
the correct vacuum to use the stock distributor, so I used the 09 that the PO
had installed.  I got the carb to where it ran well when the outside temps
were above 70, and the engine was warmed up.  When the outside temps dropped,
I would need to rejet the carb, and if the temps fall below freezing, the fuel
will condense in those long manifolds and just drip into the heads.

When I changed the distributor to one with a stock type advance curve, and
switched the single weber, to the dual setup with short manifolds, I
experienced a dramatic improvement in performance and mileage.  The increased
longer advance on the Vanagon distributor I am using makes the driving much
more enjoyable.  With the 009, I had trouble driving my bus at any speed lower
than highway.  The short curve on the 009 brings your advance up too quickly,
and my bus didn't want to drive in third gear.  Now I can drive all day in
third, and don't shift into 4th, until I'm up to 55 or 60mph.  

The dual vacuum advance distributor uses cyntrifugal advance around 12
degrees?, (sorry don't have Bentley in front of me), and 28 to 32 degrees of
vacuum advance.  So in effect, you have 42 degrees advance available to you.
The vacuum canister has both an advance and a retard port.  You can check
against Bentley and measure your vacuum and your rpms to see if your
distributor is working correctly, but you won't be able to test the benefits
of this setup unless the engine is under load.  

The advance and retard ports work against each other, and the retard side will
keep your total advance down at cruising speeds.  If you step on the gas to
pass, or pull a hill, the increased air intake in the throttle bodies will
pull your advance side up, giving you more timing advance at will.  You will
not get this effect using the 009 distributor.

If you can find a weber progressive that will work with the stock type of
distributor, and can find a way to hookup a heat riser system to the
progressive manifolds, you may get this setup to work.  I also noticed that
the progressive manifold has several spots where they will leak.  Make sure
that the flange ends are flat where they meet the heads.  I used a flat file
on the manifold to make a good connection.  I also had problems with the boots
leaking.  I bought some heavy duty neoprene boots and glued them on.

I'm no expert on this subject, and if you think I'm wrong flame away!
