&gt; How do you remove the taillight housings on a 72?

I probably shouldn't oughta be answering this, as I have never owned a '72
and these days, I make it a rule not to answer questions on buses I have
nto personnally owned, but....

&quot;72 is a transition year, I am not sure which taillight system it has (and
for all I know, it changes in mid-year) but here is the way to remove
either...

'68-71 have the oval lights and to remove them, you remove the two screws
holding the lens on then gently push the gasket thru to pop the bucket
into the body, then unplug it and remove the fixture from the inside.
OK, maybe you could pop it *out* instead, but that's how I've always done
it.

'73-79 have the rectangular lights and the bucket is fastened with 4
skinny studs and (?) M6 nuts (?) that you can not see, but can only feel
on the inside (about 1&quot; down and up from the corners on either side).
Get a 6mm deep socket on a nut driver and they will come off, then the
bucket comes out to the outside.  Oh... take the lens off first :-)
