Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Rebuild problems

#1 problem, when you bolted the engine together and
couldnt turn it by hand it was time to back up and see
what was binding, it was so tight you had to pull the
car to get the engine to turn over to start it, this
should have been a red flag, stop and fix me!! said
the engine. If you pinched a bearing, caught the
little keeper(missed getting it in the hole) that is
in the case into the hole on the bearing you have
problems. I hate to say it but the engine must be torn
down and the bearings checked, if pinched a new set of
bearing is in order. I feel for you, I hate doing
things twice. Phil
