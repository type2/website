Micheal:

Thanks for your responce.

I agree with your assessment of the altitude compensator circuit.  The
circuit #'s correspond but I have found no resistor.  There's one on the
AFM (018) between #6 and #36 under the cover but I don't think this is
germane.  Maybe there is one in the control box or in the wiring harness?

As for altitude compensators in general, I have found NO ONE on the list
however who has one nor anyone who has the high/low toggle switch as I do.
Can this be a one of a kind.  I bought the Bus new in 77 from a dealer.
Undocumented and &quot;mystery&quot; components drive my inquiring mind &quot;NUTS&quot;.

Thanks for your assistance
