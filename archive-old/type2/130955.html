Subject: Bus iPod Mount/Photos Anyone?

Thinking about getting an iPod to take along on family Westy roadtrips.  Has 
anyone figured out a clever way to mount the iPod up in the cockpit area on 
a Bay?  Photos of your installation would be great (please pmail me 
offline). I was thinking about maybe making a bracket to sling the iPod off 
the front of the ashtray or something, then using a FM transmitter 
attachment to beam the iPod signal to the indash unit.

Thanks,

Bob
