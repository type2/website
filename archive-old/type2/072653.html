Subject: '78 won't start - multiple problems

Hey ya'll.  Remember me?  Here's the lowdown on my '78.  I parked it in a
garage last July and haven't driven it since.  I tried starting it once in
September or so because I wanted to move it, but it wouldn't even try to
start so I pushed it where it needed to go.  In two weeks I'm moving and
need to drive the bus to my future home (11 hours away), so on Saturday I
went over to the garage with a battery charger/starter and hooked 'er up.

The charger indicated a fully charged battery.  I futzed around with the
connections thinking I must just not have a good one; my interior lights
don't go on, etc. my battery HAS to be dead.

Still nothing, so I crawl under to take a look at the starter/solenoid.
Surprised to see that one of the wires has broken and so I stripped it, put
a new connector on and reconnected it to the solenoid.  The wire that was
cut was the one on the side towards the front of the car of the solenoid
and it was plugged onto the solenoid opposite from all the other wires.  I
have no idea which wire it is, but I do know that it is now once again
connected.

So I try the battery charger again, but it does the same thing.  I look
through the manual a couple times making sure I'm not being stupid and
reading the meter wrong, but I'm right that when the meter is down at 0
that means it thinks it's connected to a fully charged battery.

Still nothing when I turn the key - won't even try to turn over or
anything.  I haven't tried push starting or taking the battery out of the
car and charging it - those are my next two things to try, but I also don't
want to make my friends push it all around the parking lot if it's not
going to start.

Do you think I need a new starter?  Why would my starter go bad from just
sitting there?  If it is bad, should I maybe just push start it and not
worry about replacing it, at least until I have time to?  Would you
recommend towing the bus and not even trying to drive it at this point?  I
don't know how expensive renting a u-haul truck would be and towing, but
I'm not too excited about driving one of those trucks especially because
I'm not very good at towing stuff, either.

It was fun just being around my bus for a while, though.  I spent over two
hours over there and cleaned her out and looked through everything -
memories from road trips like three Maid of the Mist ponchos from when two
friends and I went to Niagra Falls after high school, a poem my boyfriend
(we're getting married in June) wrote when we were stranded in a parking
lot after my gas pedal rusted off - remember that ordeal?  :)  Threw a lot
of stuff away and organized the rest.  It felt good reconnecting that wire
and getting dirty - the '98 Venture sure doesn't give me that feeling!
Since I'm not a subscriber, I'd appreciate pmail with your comments about
this problem.  Thanks a lot and I miss the list lots and lots.
