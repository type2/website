&gt; Dave,
&gt; The thing that you mention is #6 on Fig 7-9. As the name indicates &quot;
&gt; Piston retaining plate&quot; it retains the piston in the right position.
&gt; The right position of the piston is when the pressed-out projections
&gt; of the piston face downwards, with caliper installed
&gt;
&gt; Not many people seem to care much about that though

But then they complain when their brakes pull or squeak!

The big problem with these plates is that, if you put thing together with
the pistons and plates misaligned, the pistons will push the projections
on the plate flat, rendering them useless.  You can repair the plates by
bending the projections back out, though.
