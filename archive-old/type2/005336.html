Subject: dwell after electronic conversion
Message-ID: &lt;00c401be8454$01b4d4a0$9958fed0_at_default&gt;

Hi I recently converted from points to electronic (the magnetic
thingamabobber).  I am just curious if the dwell angle matters any more? I
hooked up my dwell/tach and it's reading about 68 degrees as opposed to the
40 something I had when I had those stupid points.
