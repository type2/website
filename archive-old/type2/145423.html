Subject: steering boxes

Hey guys,
  
  What are the first symptoms of the steering box going bad?  I've  had a lot of play which I was able to adjust to an acceptable amount  but am hearing some popping sounds that don't sound like the ball  joints.  I do have those noises (ball joint)  and will until  I replace them.  I think I'm going with the Torsion Arms from  Bus-Boys.  But I don't really want to have to buy a steering box  at the same time.  Thanks...KR
