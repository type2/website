Subject: [T2] Need source for 57mm fuel hose in virginia

Does anyone know of a source for Gates 57mm fuel resistant hose in the
southern Virginia area? I need to replace this before I put the new engine
in my Westy and so far I have come up empty.

If I cannot find a source, would anyone with a source for Gates products be
willing to send me out a foot in exchange for
price+shipping+whatYouThinkIsFair? I really need this part!!
