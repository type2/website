&gt;
&gt;1. The P.O. was an idiot
&gt;
&gt;2. The notch on my dizzy (009) is NOT lined up with the 1st cylinder firing
&gt;point. (It's lined up with #2) Is this a real problem? (The van runs pretty
&gt;good)
&gt;

This in itself is not a real problem, as the notch is merely a reference
point.

&gt;3. There are no flaps or a thermosat (see #1)]
&gt;
&gt;4. I don't think I have and EGR valve (what the heck is it supposed to look
&gt;like?)
&gt;

If your '80 Vanagon is a California model, it will not have EGR, so don't
sweat it.  If it is a federal model, the EGR valve is bolted to the left
side of the air distribution box that sits on top of the middle of the
engine.  There's a connection to it from the throttle and a pipe that runs
&gt;from it over to the left side and down through the tin.


&gt;5. The FI was replaced by a Weber progressive carb (see #1) which I know
&gt;nothing about.
&gt;
&gt;6.  My spark plugs have dry black deposits on them... what would cause
that?
&gt;

Dry black stuff = carbon = rich mixture.

&gt;7. I have a mystery valve/vaccume thing at the front left of my
&gt;compartment... on end (with rubber hose) is plugged with a screw, the other
&gt;(metal one) is not attached to anything.
&gt;

This is the fuel pressure regulator for the fuel injection system you no
longer have.  See #1.


&gt;8.  The expansion tanks on the fuel tank are disconected and I have
pressure
&gt;in the tank (see #1).
&gt;

Oh that's REAL cute.  Have fun getting it back together, you'll love the
diagram of the venting system in the manual.

&gt;Ok heres some background on what I have done/been doing....
&gt;1. I put a compu-fire ignition in the dizzy because points scare me:)
&gt;2. I have been using 20W-50 and I live in Florida
&gt;3. Sealed a leak at the gas tank filler tube (which is the cause of the
&gt;pressure)
&gt;4. Keeping it timed _at_ 7.5 BTDC _at_ ~900 rpm

This timing spec isn't really relevant for you.  This was for the stock
distributor and fuel injection.  You now have neither.
The 009 distributor needs to be timed for total advance, not initial
baseline timing.  You are shooting for total advance of around 40 degrees
BTDC.

&gt;5. Put duct tape over all the misc. holes in the tin.
&gt;
&gt;I apologize for all the dumb questions which I could probably find answers
&gt;to in the archives but I dont want to spend hours in the archives and come
&gt;up with nothing.
&gt;

If you spend hours in the archives, you will learn a lot.  Highly
recommended.


&gt;If you cant tell, this is my first VW and really my first time trying to
&gt;understand what Everything in an engine is supposed to do.  It just seems
&gt;like even with a newly rebuilt engine (~6000 miles on it) that there is a
&gt;whole lot wrong.
&gt;

Yeah, I think you can blame that on the PO.
