Hi everyone,

My 1970 Westie has been in need of a minor tune up for some time; it idles
too slowly and has an occaisional backfire. The last time I filled my gas
tank I experimented with using 92 octane unleaded and a Castol gas additive
(to remove carbon deposits, etc.). Now it really sounds bad: it runs really
rough, backfires frequently, etc.

It seems, from reading through the archives, that my new gas strategy (which
backfired, literally) could have thrown off the timing. Is this the case
and, if so, should I:

1. Try to run the engine until it uses up the gas?
2. Adjust the timing until this tank is used up, then turn it back.

This probably seems a little crazy...any thoughts?
