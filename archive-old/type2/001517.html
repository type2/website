Subject: [T2] BN2 regulator question / early bn4
Date: Mon, 5 Feb 2001 15:24:04 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

the simple problem, according to my own experience is that the fuel pump
diaphragm is too old and need replacement.

Here's Why:

At ignition stage, you pull the switch and 12 volt is apply to the fuel pump
and 4 volts to the glow plug.  The pump speed is controled by the amount of
pressure built between it's ouput and the regulator. Well in a normal
operation.  But the diaphragm is so hard that the poor energy avalable to
the pump, as the glowplug is glowing the best she could, is not anough to
have a good pumping speed and to built that pressure. Result, not enough
fuel to the heater, no fire.  Fuel / Air ratio is realy important to start a
fire...You are feeding the regulato with not anough fuel to get a good
pressure.

Ok, you finaly got some fire, hardly maintain.  suddenly, the glowplug shut
off.  The bn2 is warm anough to get the thermoswitch to set the burning
stage, just as you told me in the private Email we just got.  Then, without
a glowplug to feed, the pump get a lot more energy to fight against the
diaphragm rigidity.  It's now the time to build some good pressure.  It will
click fast until the regulator diaphragm closes the valve.  The diaphragm
regulator will deliver fuel to the heater at the rate that it was set to.
If the smoke is that black, it's too rich of course.

This theory will be the same with early Bn4.
