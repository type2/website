Subject: RE: distributor play

I've been trying to find out where to get a bushing kit for a while but with
no luck.  My distributor has a bit of play in it but possibly not excessive.
The Haynes manual quotes a figure of a few thou of difference in points gap
but I don't have the numbers on me right now.

I have a theory that a good way to measure play would be to see how much the
timing 'wobbles' by at various RPM.  This would take into account wear in
the gears, advance mechanism, etc.  I have noticed that my timing is pretty
steady at idle but jumps about more at full advance.  Anyone care to
comment?
