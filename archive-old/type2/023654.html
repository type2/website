30 degrees  ATDC for 009 is wrong.  I think you meant 30 degrees BTDC.

If you're static timing (engine off), use 7.5 BTDC.  To time at 7.5
BTDC, you must first know what the mark on the pulley is.  I know
that for a 71, the mark is at 5 degrees ATDC and is used to time with
a strobe with the stock distributor and all hoses connected.

You need to find out what your mark is at and then use it as a
reference to create a mark at 7.5 degrees BTDC for static timing.

&gt;Not sure what  engine code was original to your bus, but AD sounds 
&gt;correct.  I can check my Bently manual tonight if you like.  Anyway, 
&gt;what really matters, as has been said by another poster, is what 
&gt;distributor you have.  The original distributor in 1970 was a 
&gt;combination vacuum/mechanical advance type, with ONE vacuum line 
&gt;(i.e., 
&gt;vacuum advance only, not vacuum advance and retard as on 1971 and 
&gt;later 
&gt;years).  On my 1971 (with original distributor with two vacuum 
&gt;lines), I 
&gt;set my timing to 5 deg ATDC, at idle, with all vacuum lines 
&gt;connected. 
&gt;The reason I would need to check my Bently manual to be sure, but I 
&gt;think your '70 would be something like 5 deg BTDC, at idle with 
&gt;vacuum 
&gt;line connected.  Be cautious with my statement though, as I'm not 
&gt;sure 
&gt;what the timing mark on your pulley means (again, assuming you have 
&gt;the 
&gt;original pully).  I seem to recall that on some of the early years 
&gt;of 
&gt;the Bays, you disconnected the vacuum line and timed at 0 degrees, 
&gt;which 
&gt;is where the mark on the pulley is positioned on those engines.  To 
&gt;be 
&gt;sure about what you are doing, you need the right data, you need to 
&gt;know 
&gt;what distributor you have and what the position is of the timing 
&gt;mark on 
&gt;your pulley. Let me know if you'd like me to check, and I could 
&gt;pmail 
&gt;you from home tonight.

&gt;&gt;  oh great, and now i find a message that says 5 deg ATDC... see
&gt;&gt; http://vw.i405_dot_com/sm.asp?path=\type2_at_primenet\11\0556
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; someone please give me an intelligent sounding final answer.  just 
&gt;don't
&gt;&gt; give me any more choices!  *g*

&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; does anyone know what the best timing for a 1970 bus with a AD code
&gt;&gt; engine
&gt;&gt; would be?  I can't seem to find a definitive answer... i've 
&gt;performed a
&gt;&gt; tuneup... and the valve clearance and dwell are set perfectly, but 
&gt;now
&gt;&gt; it
&gt;&gt; performs much worse than before.  extrapolating from various 
&gt;sources
&gt;&gt; seem to
&gt;&gt; indicate:
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Static timing at either 0 or 7.5 degrees (Muir)
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; dynamic timing at 30 degrees full advance (type2_dot_com) (that would 
&gt;be
&gt;&gt; 1.75&quot;
&gt;&gt; btdc plus a smidge measured around the diameter of the pulley)
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; i'm leaving for a 1000 mile road trip tomorrow afternoon, so i'd 
&gt;love to
&gt;&gt; sort it out and not burn out a head or anything....
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; thanks in advance... dodger
