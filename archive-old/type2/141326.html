Subject: [T2]  Air Conditioner 

All this A/C talk lately brings me to this. I was at a local VW shop and the
owner asked if I knew anyone that would want a 76? bus for cheap. I checked
it out and have seen worse BUT is has what looks to be a complete A/C system
even the compressor is hooked up! Its the type that goes above your head and
behind you, not the under dash style. It does not have the motor so the pull
part that bolts to the fan is not there. He asked what someone might pay for
the bus. I told him 150-200 range and he said he would be happy to get that
for. So anyone need A/c stuff? Or bus for that matter?
