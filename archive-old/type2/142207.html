Subject: Re: [T2] locking gas cap key

Hi Dino.

Have you tried the local locksmith?   I was able to get the gas cap  
key for the westfakia duplicated at a local shopping mall kiosk.

Happy trails,

&gt; Hello all,
&gt;
&gt; Had abit of a scare this weekend when I pulled into the gas station to
&gt; fillup.  I currently only have one key (lost the 2nd key last  
&gt; year).  I keep it in
&gt; the ash tray.  Anyways, it was gone.  We went straight home and  
&gt; searched. Long
&gt; story short... we found it.  My 8 yr old had taken it out.
