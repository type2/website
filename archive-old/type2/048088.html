Subject: [T2] My new Westy

Hello Everybody,
  Just got my first type 2 a 69 westy with a 68 for parts.  well I guess
I'll start with a couple of questions.   Does any know of a company that
reproduces the actual fiberglass pop top setup, because the PO has chopped,
cropped and otherwise mutilated the top that is in place now.  I was just
wondering if I could buy it new or if I had to try to find one used
somewhere.

     Thanks in advance for any assistance you may be able to help me with.

       Jon
