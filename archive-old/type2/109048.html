Subject: Re: [T2] westy sliding door handle

&gt; Is there a source for the interior sliding door handles? I was hauling a bunch
 of kids around for a church thing a few months back and when one of them went
 to open the door, it broke in half. I could drill for some pins and JB Weld it
 together I guess, but I was wondering if new ones were around. From my
 understanding, the Westy handle is different than the passenger bus handle

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, there is a 'Westy' handle..... if you have a 68 to 73 Westy. Because the sink/cooler unit sits so close
to the door, VW made a special double-ended handle. No one that I know of repops this handle. Very very scarce
to find unbroken.

There were 2 different passenger bus handles. The early bay handle has the screw hole off center. I have only
seen this handle on 68's and early 69's. Then VW made the handle with the screw centered. The repro handles
are also center-holed.

[it would be nice if you and other people would remember to include the year of their vehicle when they ask
questions!]

I will take a pic of all 3 original handles tomorrow and put them up on a website.
