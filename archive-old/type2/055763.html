Hello again fellow denziens...

I will not bore you to tears with my frustration at my first and last
foray into full-tilt open-case engine surgery, suffice it to say that 
I am perturbed.  

I have a complete '69 westy with typical rust but a solid soul with a 
complete, non-working rebuilt (hah) DP engine.  I am at wit's end with this thing
and have had it up to my uvula with it all.  I cannot afford to sell it
(and don't want to, as a matter of fact), but cannot afford a shop-built
engine or new one for it.  It just ain't happening.

So, my proposal is: I have a basement workshop.  It is clean and relatively
dry and warm/cool depending on outside ambient air temps.  The bus is in
said garage/shop, and is also relatively clean and dry.  The floor is 
concrete.

I am looking for an intrepid soul that will come over and help me fix this
blasted thing.  I can probably afford to pay you, but understand it won't
be a mint.  I can also trade time, skills, effort, etc for your help in
ressurecting a bus that will otherwise sit stagnant for ANOTHER year (all
of you that have followed the cracked tale of Blake and his Engine know)
would be greatly appreciated.

Any takers? Other ideas?
