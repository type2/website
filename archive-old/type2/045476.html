Subject: Re: [T2] Type 4 Redline?

I was really struggling with this whole thread and wasn't quite sure why 
until I read Chris's post.  I don't think I ever get ANY of my vehicles over 
3500 rpm!  I just don't have the personality or stomach for it.  If I were to 
live in a situation (other than the occasional long uphill grade) where this 
kind of driving is frequent and necesary I couldn't take it!!

I don't think I'm harming my vehicles by &quot;enjoying the ride&quot; and I suspect my 
fuel economy, blood pressure and longevity all benefit.
