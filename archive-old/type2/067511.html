Subject: CV Clunk

Volks,

Thanks to all those who responded to my plea for help.

One of the replies suggested that tracking noises was hard. Don't I know it.

I was positive that the clunk was coming from the left, as was the 
scraping sound I was getting on the overrun. Other people who drove the 
vehicle were also sure.

We were all wrong.

I ended up with new CVs on both ends of my left drive shaft (_at_ $A120 each 
plus $A12 for 2 tubes of grease). At 10pm on the Friday night (18th 
October) I went for a test drive and the clunk was still there.
 
FRUSTRATION!!! 

I sat on the ground and grabbed the left rear wheel. Grabbed it at about 
the 10 to 2 position (like a steering wheel) and shook it as hard as I 
could. No movement. (I was looking for eveidence of loose wheel bearings). 

I went to the right wheel and did the same. There was a slight noise  
(was it a soft clunk?).

At 10.30pm I started to remove the right drive shaft. A short time later, 
when I was separating the boot from the CV, HALF a CV ball fell out of 
the CV into the boot.

I removed both CVs, replaced them with the ones from the left 
drive shaft which I had repacked and which I was surprised were making a 
noise. Had it all back together by 11.30pm (I'm getting good at this), 
took it for a drive, did complete 360 degree full lock turns to the left and 
the right.

NO CLUNK. 

Go home and tell dear patient SO that we can now go away to the 
coast on Monday.

I inspected the old CVs. They were date stamped 3/72 so they were old, 
maybe the originals. The boots were the original two piece type. The 
other half of the ball was still in the cage. All of the balls were badly 
pitted. This was the outer CV. The balls in the inner CV are not too bad. 
I will keep the outer CV as an emergency backup.

The really bad CV, and its pitted and broken balls, have been a talking 
point on the counter of the local VW spares place for the last two weeks. 
They are now back at my place as a souvenir of another chapter in my life 
as a VW bus owner.

Thanks again to those who offered advice.
