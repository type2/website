Subject: (F) Thom's folly

And so Thom sez:
&gt;&gt; Here's another compressed-air related question, kinda: How many of you out 
&gt;&gt; there have painted your busses yourselves (show of hands please)? How many
&gt;
&gt;Me!  I've done two.

&gt;&gt; Never ascribe to senility what can be adequately explained by stupidity.

   Would this be a Freudian slip? Or is it just FRIDAY!? :-)
