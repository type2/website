Subject: Re: [T2] Camper Engine in a bug


No. Early year bugs with 1200's would have problems with the tranny that can 
be sorted out, but I would think this bug has a later year tranny. If you 
have a 12 volt flywheel, its all good.

&gt;I have a spare 1600 from my Camper van.  Does anyone know if I will have 
&gt;any
&gt;problems if I put this in the bug?.
