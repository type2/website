Subject: Re: [T2] Paint Jobs and Prices.

&gt;So as I keep buying and applying paint--I laugh at the thought of some
&gt;of prior postings on getting a Bus or Van refinished---at some of the
&gt;quoted prices on any list---$275.00, $500.00, even a grand---when I can
&gt;hardley get a lawn mower painted for $700.00--plus a who cares it's mine
&gt;labor figure--

&gt;Just some food for thought--on what is possible for the costs
&gt;quoted---and that in fact it really can't be really too much of a paint
&gt;job----not for the prices quoted---

Now that Pumpkin II is running again, I'm thinking a couple years down the
road...So what is a good round dollar figure for getting a Westy
professionally preserved and painted?

Assumptions:
1. I remove all mechanicals, wiring, and furnishings.
2. I tow/transport the body to the shop.
3. I want a serious preservation job prior to painting (POR-15, etc)
4. Minimal rust: Windshield, battery box, front cab door steps

Does anyone have a ballpark guess, or experience with this?  I don't have
the facilities (or patience) to do major body work myself, so that's
probably out.
