&gt;Hi Folks,
&gt;
&gt;I am heading (By plane from Ottawa, Canada) to Costa Mesa, California on
&gt;the 13th of December for business for a week and was wondering if there
&gt;was anything of VW interest I should check out.


Lucky You,
Orange county CA is the home to just a who's who of the VW aftermarket 
industry.
Gene Berg, Kymco, BFY, Fat Performance, and the list goes ON and ON and 
ON.  You could spend more than a day hitting them all.  I know from 
experience, since I hit a bunch of them with a bug-head friend who was over 
here from Singapore.  You'd a thought he died and went to heaven.
