Subject: Re: Empi vs. Bugpack merged aftermarket exhaust for 77 Westy

I've had this one installed since about 1998:

http://busdepot_dot_com/details.jsp?partnumber=071251053EK

It has outlasted aftermarket extractor systems by a factor of many. Only 
problem is that it doesn't support a catalytic converter, but my '79 bus is 
now beyond the 25-year cutoff for Austin's recently-adopted emissions 
testing. If I could find a complete exhaust system with a 3-way cat 
converter, I'd probably buy it, if it was not too godawfully expensive.

Here's a description of it from www.BusDepot_dot_com:

Complete Exhaust System
Premium Quality, European made OEM, for 72-74 Bus. Includes German muffler 
plus tailpipe and install kit. Also can be used on 79 Bus, and on 75-78 with 
modifications. (See notes.)

Description: This setup is far superior in quality to any extractor-type 
system. It is stock in the U.S. for '72-74 Bus. It also fits a 79 Bus but 
with no provision for CAT or EGR. It can also fit 75-78 Bus with minor 
modification if 72-74 heat exchangers are used.

Part Reference Number*: 071251053EK
Availability: Usually ships in 1-3 working days (sooner if ordered via air 
shipment)    QtyPrice
 $169.95

&gt; Ron et al;
&gt; I've noticed that Empi's merged aftermarket exhaust merges and and the 
&gt; collector points directly to the passenger side. The Bugpack collector 
&gt; points straight back. I like the design of the Empi better, as it will 
&gt; allow me to modify any old muffler and attach it. Paying 200 dollars each 
&gt; time my muffler dies is killing me. All I need is the three bolt flange 
&gt; which is readily available anywhere to fit a 24 dollar FLAPS muffler. I 
&gt; have three questions.
&gt; 1) Has anyone seen this Empi for sale that fits a 77? Ron at Busdepot only 
&gt; shows the one for the early buses with the rectangular exhaust ports.
&gt; 2) How far down does the Empi header hang, enough to be a clearance 
&gt; problem? Does it hang down as much as the Bugpack?
&gt; 3) What is the quality like? Someone said the Empi's were actually quite 
&gt; well made.
