&gt; It seems to me that &quot;just-in-time&quot; manufacturing and planned 
&gt; obsolescence are
&gt; very expensive technologies to utilize in vehicle manufacturing. Our 
&gt; beloved
&gt; type2s didn't need these technologies to be popular. They were popular 
&gt; because
&gt; they were useful and affordable.
&gt;
&gt; Good design makes a vehicle useful. Standardized manufacturing can 
&gt; make it
&gt; affordable. The problem is that there's no incentive for this in the 
&gt; current
&gt; automotive industry.


And in a few short years the airbags, automatic HVAC controls, LCD 
touchscreen, proprietary entertainment system, and 101 other little 
gadgets start failing and cost the moon for most people to repair 
leading to replacement of the vehicle and an early trip to the crusher 
for that vehicle. When I was a kid the junkyard cars around here were 
mostly wore out or crashed. Now they still look pretty good and are much 
younger. Admittedly cars age better than they used to in the corrosion 
and paint categories...

That is why I like my Cabrio so much. Except for some expensive creature 
comfort modules, the car is pretty simple. Love those cable operated 
rotary HVAC controls. Simple. I don't want an automatic tranny anytime 
soon b/c when they go out it's $1.5K+ to repair (if you pay somebody 
else to do the repair). Friend tells me his older Mazda mini-van has a 
chassis matched tranny that can only be sourced at the dealer. Van is 
only worth $3K or so but if the tranny fails tomorrow it gets junked 
despite a good engine. I'll take a 5 speed thanks.
