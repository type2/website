Subject: Re: [T2] Re: AC in Southern Buses (short...very short)

Well, we have had tons of discussion about A/C and busses, and without 
any name-calling or attitude adjustments, it all just boils down to:

1. Want it, and willing to pay for it.
2. Don't want it, don't need it, and saving pennies for something else.

Everything else is just our own opinions, and are to be valued for what 
they're collectively worth.

Now tell me more about this Gilmore A/C unit you speak of!
