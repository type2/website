Subject: Re: [T2] HUBCAP REVIVAL??
Content-Disposition: inline

My 1973 has the ORIGINAL chrome hubcaps. I was wondering, since they are starting to show some surface rust, what product does the list recommend to repaint them?? I know that replacing them is inexpensive, but since they are the ORIGINAL ones, I want to keep them, (I am sick that way).
