Subject: Re: Asbestos in your heating system.

This is covered extensively in the archives, those of you with concerns
should read everything with &quot;asbestos&quot; in it (that should take a while). Go
to www.type2_dot_com and hit the &quot;Archive&quot; button.

VW eventually claimed that it had been replacing the heater boxes as part
of a &quot;study&quot; (not a response to an implicit lawsuit threat or a &quot;silent
warranty&quot;, such as the vasserboxer engines had) and stopped replacing them
when VW concluded there was no danger to health present.

One prescient listee has pointed out since that the Le Coz team was never
observed to take samples from the heater ducting in the cab, or from the
heat outlets of a running bus, which seems peculiar for a study designed to
determine exposure levels.

AFAIK no data were ever released by VW (or, to be fair, requested of them).

I would read up on the astronomical exposure levels required to be a real
risk before I became apopleptic about this, and I would note that if you
are that concerned about safety you are probably driving the wrong vehicle
for a hundred better reasons than this.

If necessary I can dig up the name and email of the VW public relations
officer who sent me &quot;it's not our fault&quot; mail.
