Subject: Re: [T2] Driving from Jackson, Wyoming to Victor, Idaho

&gt; I just returned from Jackson, Wyoming.  I saw quite a few buses there:
&gt; Splittys, Early Bays, a few late Bays, and Vanagons.  I was wondering
&gt; what it's like to drive the 20 or so miles from Jackson, Wyoming to
&gt; Victor, Idaho in a Bus.  Seems like it might be a bit of a challenge
&gt; with the 8000 ft elevation and the 10 percent grade.
&gt;
&gt; Anybody ever done this drive in a Bus?

Yes.  I did it last June in my 1980 Westy.  I do not recommend it for
anyone in a bus, unless you live in Jackson, WY For everyone else, the
risk is too high and you are way too far from home.  Even empty, it would
be a real strain on a bus and as anyone who has seen my bus knows, I
travel anything but empty.

The hill is, as promised, very steep and it is switchbacks all the way.
I had both oil pressure and temperature gauges and I had set the stop
point at 20psi or 250F, whichever came first.  I had to stop twice on that
hill.  The good thing is that it does not matter where you stop, the view
is spectacular and waiting is not a real problem.  The down side is that
there is *NOTHING* flat for miles and I had a hard time finding a place
level enough that the parking brake would hold!
