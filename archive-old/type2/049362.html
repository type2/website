Subject: Re: [T2] sighting - pics, what model??? i like it!!!

&gt; I would guess its an AdventureWagen. The color and slider windows suggest 78
&gt; or 79. Adventurewagens were usually made from stock passenger buses which
&gt; would account for the trim and stylee graphics. Ahhhh, the 70s.

I have seen US buses before with this colour combination. They don't
have them over here. So I am wondering...which colour combination is
this? What are the names of the colours?
