Subject: Re: [T2] FI noob - what's this for

&gt; I've noticed in the pictures of different FI systems on different
&gt; busses, there is this metal rod that comes from the driver's side and
&gt; goes either to the plenum or under it.  Not surprisingly, some of the
&gt; best detail can be found on RAtwell's site.  On the vacuum hoses page,
&gt; it can be seen in the overhead picture, but I can't tell where it
&gt; terminates.  I have looked through the fuel injection pictue album on
&gt; his site (http://homepage.mac_dot_com/ratwell/Parts/PhotoAlbum62.html), but
&gt; the spot where I thought it terminated (on the RH side of the EGR
&gt; actuating rod picture) it isn't there.  Looks like a coverplate
&gt; instead.

not being able to view the photos on this e-mail site I am going to
venture a guess that it may be the auto transmission accelerator link to
the transmission for the kick down etc.

the auto tranny bus has a  totally different accelerator linkage, the
cable from the pedal goes to the tranny and not the engine. there is a
solid rod from the trans to the engine.
