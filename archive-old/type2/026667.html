Phil, I had some scratches on the ceiling panels of my 71 Westy, so I
figured a quick refinishing would be in order.  Problem was that when I
sanded it down, the &quot;wood grain&quot; sanded off!  The white tinted wood grain
was just painted on.  Must have been some type of silkscreen or roller
finish.  Anyway, the wood grain underneath, the real grain, wasn't all that
different looking.  I was able to duplicate the original look with a white
tint, but it wasn't easy.  The advantage of the original painted on wood
grain finish is that it doesn't darken or yellow with age.  I used exterior
grade latex (water based) topcoat to prevent yellowing.  All in all I'd say
fix the scratches with touch-up paints.  Too much work to refinish unless
your ceilings are really messed up.
