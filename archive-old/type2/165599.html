Yes, but for a sacrificial anode to be useful it has to be immersed in the
same body of electolyte as the metal that it is saving.  On a vehicle, the
little drops of salt water would each have to have its own anode.  Plating
serves this purpose on plated parts, but bolting a chunk of zinc to the
body won't work.

I think that the ultimate solution to this problem is legislative.  If we
could somehow switch the road people from salt to sand it would save a lot
of cars.  I don't expect that to happen politically, though it would be
interesting to see who comes out against such a proposal.  The salt
providers would, of course, but I'll bet the auto manufacturers
would kick in a few opposition bucks.
