Last night I had an experience with it which I thought interesting. For the
first time, I &quot;topped off&quot; the gas tank. After a right turn I noticed the
strong smell of gasoline. I pulled over, ran around to the back and noticed
that gas was pouring down from behind the rear driver's side tire. I watched
nervously as the gasoline pour slowed to a drip, then &quot;Pow!...Pow!&quot;, about
the sound of two loud backfires, several seconds apart. What amazed me was
that the sounds came from my BN4!  My uneducated guess is that gas fumes
accumulated under the intake pipe, were drawn into the hot combustion
chamber and exploded. I have yet to turn the heater back on.  I have,
however, become familiar with the workings of my fire extinguisher.
