&gt; I was thinking of doing the reverse. The DP and SP have different heads and

&gt; generator. 

Some versions of the dual port engine used the 30mm carb and had an
appropriate center section to fit.  When I converted our 69 bug to
dual-port I happened to pick up a 30mm center section by chance at the
local pick-your-part.  It was several years before I realized what a
stroke of luck it was to have picked up this part here in SoCal.

I think that it was probably for a euro delivery 1300cc engine.
