Well, I have had a heckuva time finding the proper condenser for my bus.  The ones I get at the FLAPS (even a good, local VW flaps) are always slightly different.  Either the plastic block that goes through the distributor body is the wrong shape, or the bracket is the wrong shape, or on the wrong side, or... ??  Anyone else have this problem?

&gt;I must admit its an interesting experience, going from tweaking out noisy, fast Subaru's &lt;snip&gt;

Many of us are infected with more than one car virus.  Certain listmembers I know are into Corvairs, Porsches, various obscure English orphan-mobiles and most recently, Fieros.  I am also into Mustangs and for some reason it doesn't bother me to switch between a mid-12 vehicle and one that can barely achieve freeway speeds.  Kind of keeps life interesting, I guess.

Is your last name really havoc?  Too cool.
