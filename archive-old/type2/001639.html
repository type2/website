Hi Den,
    I just saw your post to the type two list about your clattering  engine.
I too had a clatter in a 77, but with solid lifters.  The clatter went away
when the engine stopped running.  The reason for the clatter was that the
rivets holding the camshaft gear to the shaft were loose.  One day they
failed all together and it was time for an overhaul.  If you remove the
cooling fan and shroud, and then the oil pump, you should be able to see the
rivets.    Good luck.
