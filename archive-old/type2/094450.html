I know you said vanagon, but this is my belt from GoWesty (it's a new VW
belt for a Jetta) which came with an L-shaped bracket for installation.

I decided not to drill another hole.

I thought this was an interesting alternative installation:

Someone recently asked me once how much does the belt come out when
installed down in the original hole. In order words could a larger person
secure the belt? I measured and it seems if your belly can clear the
steering wheel you'll be ok mounting the belt lower down.

&gt; The lock on the thing seems really sensitive, so I am guessing I will need
&gt; it to be almost perfectly below the top shoulder belt piece or it will twist
&gt; the fabric and lock up every time.

It will seem that way until you mount it, then the belt with come out easily
and lock only with a quick pull.
