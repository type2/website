I've seen a type1 engine retrofitted to a 72.  The PO had fabricated a mustache
bar out of square tubing, and tin to fill in between the body and the type1 
tin,
out of sheet aluminum.  They did a very nice job.  It did, however, have an
air filter box made out of (now decayed) cardboard, sitting on top of a 
single Zenith carb.
