I had the same fear, so what I have done is a s follows; drill a hole in
the 'push-in' part of the catch;

- ----

(oh no...more dodgy ascii art...sorry! - it is Friday though!)

the 'O' here shows the hole.  I then got a nice 'tight' chrome padlock
to go through the hole, and covered the outside of it in underseal to
stop it damaging the paintwork etc.

Seems to work, as nothings gone missing yet!

&gt; I would also be interested in anyone's ingenious ideas for making the contents
&gt; of their bus more secure.

I have done a number of things.  This was was to install an alarm, with
a flashing led.  The second, for camping trips was to install a small
'safe' on the floor of the bus, bloted through the flor, with the
'bolts' inside the safe - very hard to get to without destruction, and
this takes time, and makes noise.

The final this I have done is for my CD player (6 disc)...I have made a
'hidden' cabinet with a hidden opening switch, so it looks like there's
nothing there.  E-mail me for further details if you want....

I wouldn't say that these were particularly 'ingenious' though, would
you?!
 
&gt; Perhaps i am just paranoid....

Yup. Join the club!
