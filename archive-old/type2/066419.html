Subject: aircooled, no search, possible rescue

Hi all - I have a lead on a mid-60s camper (guy said Dormobile, but you
know people trying to sell cars...); another gent who looked at it says
only 'non-german camper job.' It is 12v, don't know if it is original.
Motor is cooked, he says. I may look at it this week; so I need to know
what to look for in a camper, ie, what would be a really good, non
westfalia setup to stumble across. Asking price is $400 OBO! I *don't* need
another bus, but thought I'd look; it might be of interest to someone else
on the list if it is the right model, yes? I am camper-challenged (despite
all the recent interior posts!), so appreciate the help.
