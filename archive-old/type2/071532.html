&gt;  What is, in your opinion, the most useful, indespensible, 'changed your
&gt;  life after you started using it' tool, for working on VW Campers? It
&gt;  doesn't have to be big, expensive, complicated or hard-to-find. Just the
&gt;  tool that is 'brilliant'.

Various books suggest that a spanner with a bent shaft is usful for removing
the carb on a 1600 single carb upright engine - personaly I've never found a
problem with a straight spanner. But I had some spare cash one day at a show
and bought a set of curved spanners (curved like a crescent moon). I think
they only cost about £8 UK ($12 USA), but their usefulness is far beyond that
price - giving access to lots of ackward corners. 

So for unexpected usefulness far beyond the price payed my vote goes for
crescent shaped spanners.

Good luck
