Subject: FIRE DAY FRIDAY

Being that it is FFFRRRIIIDDDAAAYYY   I was looking at some German VW sites
and came across this picture
 http://www.volksteile_dot_de/seiten/westfalia/westfalia-27.JPG ) of a fire
extinguisher that was stock in the German busses in 74.  Were these stock in
USA busses?  Anyway a reminder to get/or update your fire extinguisher!!!

I know it saw that in one of the VW magazines!!!!
