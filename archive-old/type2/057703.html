Subject: Real Shame!

Just went out and pushed my '81 Vanagon over to the corner of the
yard, ready for the junkyard to haul away. It's a real shame it has to
go that way -- looks pretty nice sitting there, like it's already to
drive away. No engine, of course, and I pulled the tranny and both axles
w/CV joints out. But the A/C and gas heater are still there, too much
work to pull all of that -- I was starting to wonder what the heck I was
doing pulling the axles -- spent more time getting the used ones out
then I would spend at my job to buy new ones. 
     My son keeps giving me a bad time because I don't put it into my
semi-trailer. I could, there's lots of room if I just moved some of the
stuff in the back, and I've got the ramps, but -- driving it in is one
thing, pulling it in with a come-along is another -- and I notice he
hasn't volunteered to drive down from Wisconsin to help either. 8-) 
     Too bad tho, really it is -- nice body, nice interior. Just not
enough time and energy for me to deal with it. I'm outa' here by the
1st.
