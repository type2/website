Subject: '68 Type II 

Alrightee . . .my 1968 Type II Dual cab got into an accident the other day
and the officer wrote it up as totalled.  The front end was smashed up but
the insurance company doesn't want to pay for the repair.  Can anybody give
me an estimate on it before the accident?  It was a '68, white and green
paint (needed to be redone, but it wasn't too bad) body was in pretty decent
condition, a little rust in the bed - nothing major, couple of dents here
and there . . . stock mirrors intact, radio (still working) emblem, seats,
engine (still running great), rubber was pretty good still, too.  Your
estimate could save truck!!!!  BTW, I'm not on the mailing list so please
send all replies to:

Thank you all very greatly . . .my pickup and I appreciate it!
