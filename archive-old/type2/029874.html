Is the fuse the correct value?  As I recall, this is one of the few red

&gt; Hello, we picked up a 78 westy a few weeks ago, and the van is in great
&gt; shape  80,454 miles, except NO HEAT What keeps happening is that it
&gt; blows fuse #9 when trying to start the BA-6 heater. Could someone please
&gt; 
&gt; explain the process in which the heater should start. With the engine
&gt; running and both levers down, once I turn the heater switch about 15-20
&gt; seconds later fuse #9 blows, the only other thing that seems to take
&gt; place is that a relay clicks over.
