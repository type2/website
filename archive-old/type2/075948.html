Subject: [T2] ignition lock removal


&gt; i bought a 73 bus which has only door keys that work and no key thats
works
&gt; on the ignition.  I was able to remove the whole assembl;y that holds the
&gt; cylinder and the steering columb but cant find a way to remove the cylider
&gt; so that I can get a key made.  locksmiths are all quoting $70-100 to drill
&gt; it out, say I should bring it to them apart will be cheaper.  how can this
&gt; be done?
