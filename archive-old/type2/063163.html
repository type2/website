&gt;         My Question: is this a one-time Westy? 

westy's didn't have fabric headliners, if that is what your bus has/had someone put 
in the interior. Westy's were based on a kombi not a micro as your bus started life.

 Or some other 
&gt; conversion
&gt; that has been changed by some PO? We would really appreciate your
&gt; professional advice on this, to guide our restoration.
&gt;         The most amazing/strange thing: somebody had installed a VDO 
&gt; water
&gt; temp guage in the dash!(probably hooked up to a dipstick oil
&gt; temperature sender. We can't tell, most of the engine compartment
&gt; wiring was consumed in a light engine fire)
