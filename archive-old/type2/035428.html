Subject: Re: Electric fan cooling proposal

&gt;All I want to say is that the stock fan, by testing with dynometer, takes
about 7
&gt;hp at 4500 rpm.  (my source was several magazine articles concerning vw
dyno
&gt;tests in vw trends and hot vw magazines, they refer to over 10 hp at race
engine
&gt;rpms like 6000)

&gt;You are therefore looking at matching that sort of power with your two
electric
&gt;motors.  I think even a 3 hp electric motor on each side is too heavy and
&gt;impractical to power at 12 volts, maybe 10 amps each?

1hp = 746 watts (unless your american horsepower are different from ours).

So 3hp x 2 = 4476 W.

&gt;From a 12V supply thats 4476/12 = 373 Amps - before you start considering
conversion efficiency.

Need I say more?

Cheers
