Subject: Re: [T2] Sacrilidge, Subaru Ea-81 into 78 VW Bus

No pics, but it is easy to describe.  The radiator is placed with it long
axis parallel to the bus' long axis.  The bottom of the radiator is
nestled back into the left side of the engine bay outboard of the
stiffening flange (early baywindow
bus).  The top of the radiator is tilted toward the middle of the bus and
ends near the top of the bay just inboard of the air duct from the intake
vent.
There was a light framework around the radiator that carried
rubber seals to the body that prevented recirculation.

I wish I could remember the origin of the Japanese radiator.  It was the
perfect shape and size for the opening, and a heck of a lot cheaper than
a custom radiator.

&gt;  George,
&gt; You don't know of any pics of this set up do you?
&gt; I'd be interested to see how exactly you'd fit a radiator down one side of the engine bay.
&gt; Having said that, I could fit a case of beer or so on the left hand side tray of my 77's engine bay.
&gt; :-)

&gt; &gt; &gt; I've seen a couple of conversions where the radiator is located in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; left engine bay, drawing air from the left air intake and exhausting it
&gt; &gt; &gt; through the gaps around the engine (no more engine bay seal) I've also
&gt; &gt; &gt; seen a conversion done with the radiator replacing the engine bay door,
&gt; &gt; &gt; but that one had cooling problems, probably due to lack of shrouding
&gt; &gt; &gt; around the radiator to prevent recirculation.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This is THE primo radiator shroud...

&gt;
&gt; this one is certainly the most attractive, but I'm not happy with the
&gt; engineering aspects of the installation. It does nothing to prevent
&gt; recirculation, which is the usual cause of overheating. I think that the
&gt; spare tire arrangement would work fine in motion, but would have problems
&gt; when moving slowly or stopped. I note that he used an extremely efficient
&gt; (and expensive) custom radiator, so he might have enough excess capacity
&gt; there to overcome recirculation problems.
&gt;
&gt; Another problem is one of vulnerability. One parking-lot tap and you've
&gt; got a major problem with the spare tire radiator.
&gt;
&gt; The engine bay installation I saw was done with a stock radiator from a
&gt; japanese car (don't remember which) that pretty much filled the left side
&gt; bay with the diagonally mounted radiator. the radiator was well-sealed
&gt; all around and equipped with the fan that came on the radiator. In order
&gt; for air to recirculate to the radiator it would have to go all the way
&gt; from the bottom of the engine to the left-side air inlet. I really liked
&gt; this installation as it was inexpensive, efficient, and gave no visible
&gt; evidence of the modification from outside the bus. The coolent lines were
&gt; short and didn't need bleeding like long lines to the front of the bus
&gt; would.
