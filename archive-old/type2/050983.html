Subject: [T2] bus for sale in australia

are there list members in australia, i'm sure there are a few of you out
there.  anyway, it is with great sadness that i must put my bus up for sale.
anyway here is the lowdown:

1974 transporter (type 224), which was i believe an 1800, but currently has
a 1600dp in it.  please note both the engine and the gearbox are very tired,
and probably due for a rebuild, in fact definitely due for a rebuild.  btw,
the gearbox is an 1800 box, and the cv's are looking very sad.

the body is good and straight for its age, with only a bit of rust around
the windscreen seal, a little bit in the lefthand footwell, and some in the
sill under the sliding door, and the usual assortment of minor scrathches,
dents and worn out seals.  when i bought it in 98 i spent a weekend painting
the underneath with bitumen compound.  it has a sunroof (aftermarket), and
comes with the middle and rear bench set, and a spare pair of front buckets,
as well as other sundry spare parts items.  this bus is worth fixing up,
honest!

the asking price for all this is a mere $1200 (australian banana republic
money of course)
for those interested, i live in brisbane, and i can be contacted via email
at johnlees_at_optusnet_dot_com.au or via telephone at (07)33724988.
help me out and provide a good home for my bus, i shall miss it so very
much, but i have to get a more reliable and economical car while i am
studying, but never fear, i shall get another bus when the time and finances
are in my favour.  in the meantime, i have enjoyed this list, for the things
i have learned you have my eternal gratitude.

john!
(who shall be vw less for a few years to come)
