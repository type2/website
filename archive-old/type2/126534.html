Subject: Re: Convert walkthrough to a bench seat?

Thanks for the comments and tips all.

I should clarify WHY I'm entertaining this chain of thought: 

My wife wants to seat 6 in the bus. Stock it seats 5. 2 in the rear
bench/bed, 1 in the jumpseat, and 2 up front. My bus didn't come with
the fridge at all, and I was just going to get another jumpseat to
mount where the fridge went behind the passenger front seat.

But that precluded any chance of putting the stock kitchen in. And the
stock kitchen for a 73 is pretty lame, even assuming I can find one in
good shape. So I continue searching for options.

Then an angel gave me the kitchen from a 77. It's got the dual power
fridge (propane and electric), in addition to a sink and stove. But
it's twice as long as the stock one for the 73. I'll probably just put
it in the stock location for the 77 (behind the driver's seat) and
finangle the seating so I can put the jumpseat behind the passenger
seat. I'll probably shift the rear bench passengerwards like in the 77
and put the new cabinets on the driver's side. But then I'm trying to
work out table locations and such.

(head now spinning)

Putting the kitchen behind the front seats allows me to leave
everything else alone, and allows me to try to find a way to put a
third seat in the front. I was thinking of building one out of steel
tubes, making some uber strong brackets, and mounting in the middle.
But I figured that since there were some bench seat busses, that I'd
look into the possibility.

Hmm. . . I wonder if getting a front bench from an old domestic car
would be possible. Time to take some measurements and go to Pick Your
Part.
