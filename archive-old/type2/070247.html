Subject: Sigh... No More Vanagon

Mrs. M., the world's most beautiful 82 Westfalia, made a fatal error on our
trip to Oregon.  Namely, she belched, farted, and quit altogether at Craters
of the Moon in the Idaho desert country.  A sensor in the fuel injection, we
found out later.  Sadly, this happened on a Friday evening, 90 miles from
pretty much anything but a Park Service office &amp; a little town where the
mechanics sneered at VW's with sick fuel injection.   We had her to the 90
miles into Idaho Falls, to the VW dealer (not VW Bob's, sadly) and put up at
a motel.

Da Spouse, who had made it clear that the Mrs. was already on probation,
more-or-less wigged out and put his foot down (on my skull) and announced
that we were getting a new car.  I didn't feel like I dared argue unless I
wanted to continue the trip solo.  So, the long and short of it is that Mrs.
M., (whom son Chris termed my Fatal Attraction) got traded in on a Subaru
Legacy wagon :(   The VW/Subaru dealer in Idaho Falls, Wackerli Imports,
treated us well &amp; were quite happy to take in such a lovely Vanagon,
allowing more for trade than we paid for her initially.   As an aside, I got
a call from her probable new owner last night, wondering just *why* I
ditched the Mrs. in the middle of a trip...

Anyway, I still have Die Frau, and Chris &amp; I will soon start fiddling with
DOA to see what the score is there, but my beautiful Vanagon is gone!
AAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHH!

(And the Subaru, while quite nice, is so, normal.  So, yuppie-scum-like...)
