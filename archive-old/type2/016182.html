I have a 76 bus with a 78 engine (love those hydraulic lifters) and if I
need something for the engine, I simply ask for a 1978 transporter part.  If
I need something for the rest of the bus, I ask for a 76 trasporter part.  I
see no reason to confuse the pimple faced kid at the FLAPS counter or mail
order call center any more than I have to.  The reason everyone acts like
there wasn't a 2000cc (1970cc) engine in 1975 is because there wasn't (as
far a I have seen or heard of).  The 1800 and 2000 are identical in more
ways than not.  It is most likely that your bus has had a 2.0L installed
later in life or its 1800 has been upgraded with larger pistons and
cylinders.  Check the Bentley and your engine code will tell you if indeed
you have a 76 or later 2.0L.  I think the code is GD, but I'm at work and
I'm not certain off the top of my head.

hey all,

&gt;i have a 1975 westy with a 2000cc engine, why is it that when i look for 
&gt;replacement parts in all the catalogs parts are listed as 1800cc 1974 to 
&gt;1975 or 2000cc 1976 to 1979.  Why does everyone act like there was not a 
&gt;2000cc in 1975????&gt;&gt;

&gt;And what do I look for when I need to, say, replace the pistons and 
&gt;cylinders/heads?

&gt;Again thanks for the help in advance.  Things just are a little confusing
to 
&gt;me on my first rebuild.

&gt;Adam
