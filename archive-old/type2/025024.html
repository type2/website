greetings...this is my first post asking for something......anyways my blower
fan went out yesterday...a lot of squealing then stopped.  can these things be
repaired ( like taking the electric motor out and replacing it instead of
replacing a whole unit??  and secondly....if anyone has a used motor i am
interested in purchasing it from you.  my local boneyards here have turned up
nothing ( they have been pretty picked over by me on a regular
basis....)................thanks for the help.
