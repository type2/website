I did this in my Westy.  I used a repro fuse block for a VERY early
bug--only has four fuses--that I got inexpensively from Wolfsburg West.
They are really neat little Bakelite things with a cover held on by a screw.

&gt;I am not sure if I will run a larger wire back to the engine or just take off
&gt;one unused terminal on my fuse block.

Run the extra wire.  You'll never regret doing that--but you might regret not.
