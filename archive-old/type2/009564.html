In NJ here the nozzles have spring activated sealing rings that you have to
compress as you put the nozzle into the filler port.   To fill without
holding it, the ring kind of grips the edge of the port and the nozzle sits
horizontally in the filler entrance- ready to crack the rubber elbow.  In
other states, there is no sealing ring, and it's easy to leave the nozzle
pointing down at the correct angle.  I NEVER let an attendant fill the bus-
but hold the nozzle myself at a down angle so its tip can't crack the
elbow.  In this &quot;can't serve yourself&quot; state they never question my doing
it myself when I mention the dangers of leaving it alone in the port, and
they don't want to hold it for 12 gallons either!
