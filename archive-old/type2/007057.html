Subject: Re: [T2] Broken Valve Spring

Hello List  I have done this a bunch. Take a compression gage like snap-on 
that has the hose that hooks to the gage and take the valve out of the hose 
and connect to your air supply. I made my valve spring compressor by bending 
a piece of steel , cutting a notch out of the end and drilling a hole. You 
bolt the compressor to the rocker bolt lift it to compress the spring with 
the valve stem coming thur the notch , remove the keepers, take old spring 
off and install new spring.  Mark Dearing Salem Import service salem Va.
