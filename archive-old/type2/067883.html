Greg Merritt ('71 Type III) showed me how his electric clock works:  there
is a little solenoid, which activates every 6 minutes or so,turning a
little spring to wind up the clock!!!!!  When the spring winds down, it
reactivates the solenoid.  So it's not really an electric clock, it's an
electrically-assisted wind-up clock.  This, cleverly, makes constant
voltage unnecessary.  I think that early splittie clocks were actually
manual wind-up clocks, but I'm not sure.

'62 Kombi--no clock, or even clock cut-out :-(
