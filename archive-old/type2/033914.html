Subject: Re: childs cot-early/late + make your own!

&gt;   The later ones had the adjustable stamped/bent flat steel
&gt; galvanized &quot;poles&quot;.

I have a nice childs cot with these style poles...but they are not adjustable
as far as I can see.  How were they supposed to adjust?  If anyone would want
to trade this cot (and all mounting hardware) for a nice (no rips or holes)
cot that would fit my 71, I'd like to do that.

thanks
Isaiah
