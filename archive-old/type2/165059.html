Subject: decibel

I have a 1977 Westy, it is loud inside.

I borrowed a decibel meter from work Friday to test it on my way home.

Sitting in the parking lot idling, windows up, 86dB, 85dB has an 8 hour permissible exposure time (PET from here forward), not too bad, but it is only idling.

I get on the road, 55mph on smooth pavement, 98dB.  

Now this is a problem, regular old smooth pavement at 55mph and I am already at 98dB, the PET for 97dB is 30 minutes at 100dB the PET is 15 minutes, no wonder I get exhausted after 1 hour.

I get on I-84 west from the 181st onramp, hit the concrete at 62mph (checked by GPS many times) and the &quot;thunder&quot; starts, I am holding 102dB with occasional spikes to 104dB.

The PET for 100dB is 15 minutes as I already said, and at 103dB the PET drops to 7.5 minutes.

I need hearing protection to drive my bus!  If it was a jobsite OSHA would shut it down.

I measured the decibels because I want to work on quieting it down, one thing at a time, and measure the gain, no psychological trickery, I hope to give good results to everybody.

At this point, with the 98dB at just about any time I am driving, I think that most of it is engine noise coming inside, I wonder how much I can gain with new gaskets around the back door and engine door.

Any suggestions on the quietest exhaust?

I think a good goal is 85dB in normal driving conditions, any comments on a good goal?

VW-less P.S., I am desperate, can somebody direct me to some 1975 Volvo 164 4 speed parts, most specifically the bracket the clutch pedal mounts to.
