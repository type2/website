&gt;i putzed around the engine today...and was trying to figure out where to mount
&gt;the oil pressure sending unit....anyone have some suggestions? is there any
&gt;special way it has to be mounted? i was thinking of mounting it on a ring
&gt;bracket that is on the firewall, with the hose going down. i don't know what
&gt;this bracket used to be but it seems perfect for the sending unit. now for the
&gt;really dumb question...where does the end of the hose screw into? duh.

I may have missed earlier discussion on this... I assume you're talking
about one of the aftermarket VDO senders.  Mine came with a round metal
clamp to mount it.  I attached it to the fan housing with the terminals
pointing towards the back of the van.  The hose goes in the hole where the
old binary oil pressure sending unit was - next to the distributor.
