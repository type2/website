Subject: A vacuum guage for a bus owner, please read

Hello List,

Well I waited until it was Friday before I posted this
message. I must say that one of my favorite moments at
Everybus was following Steve Dolan around, watching
and learning as he fixed several people's busses. I
found it amazing how much information that Steve was
able to obtain from a dwell meter, timing light, and a
vacuum guage. I wanted to tell everyone that I found a
vacuum guage in the tool section of Sears_dot_com. This
guage not only measures manifold vacuum, but it also
measures fuel pressure. This would be the perfect tool
for a bus owner. Not only can you make sure that the
vacuum is correct on your bus but you can also check
your fuel pump, and fuel flow through your fuel lines!

Here is the page:

It only costs $19.00. I would say this would be a very
good investiment. Any way, I just thought I would pass
it along.

Have a nice day!
