Hi.

ok, im at work and everyone I knows out of town for a halloween party so ill 
just

heres the jist of it : I drove here with seemingly no problems other than 
being really low on gass. I got here fine, and 4 hours later went to grab 
some lunch. As soon as I got out of the parking lot (of course) it would 
buck real hard on and off but only with my foot on the gas and kill. Id 
start it up, give it some gas and it would kill. eventually I got it to 
drive up the hill a bit, and the gas station is at the bottom (whew!) so i 
coasted in and filled it up, almost. Technically it should have had another 
gallon in there, but oh well, that was all it was I thought. But now it 
doesnt stay running. I can start it, and if I pump the gas in real short 
quick motions itll chug enough to stay running for a bit until I either try 
to put it in gear or give it continious gas.

Im remembering this wierd bucking problem I had some time ago, still not 
sure what it was. Id fix something, it would kinda go away, come back on a 
random day but always go away after I drove it a little bit, or at least got 
it out of the lower gears.

Well, it just wont let me give it any gas now. I can start it, and it will 
run but if I try to drive it, it will buck like a mechanical bull.. like 
someones pinching the gas line/letting some though, pinching it again, 
letting a little more through.. its soo wierd. Ive explained this to at 
least 3 different mechanics and none of them ever really know what it could 
be..

So im not sure what to do at this point... before if I just drove it, it 
seemed like it would work the kinks out itself and kinda putter/chug then 
finally vrooooommmm   but no dice this time.

at one point someone mentioned maybe the air flaps being stuck? To be honest 
I cant even think of where those would be right now.

I know theres supposed to be some sort of old vw show tomorrow here in sam 
meteo so maybe I can camp and find that in the morning, ill have to hunt 
around a bit and see if I can dig up the info on that event.

If anyone has anything I might be able to try here in the parking lot, im 
all ears!!

and it just had to be raining didnt it? maybe its unhappy because of the 
rain? who knows...
