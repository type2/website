Subject: heat exchanger to cooling shroud cover on g 1.7 

Thers are two covers (caps) that go over were the heat exchanger and the
cooling shroud meet ( they are just to semi-seal the two) and there are
flaps(non air return flaps) underneath. Are these crucial. I am finishing a
rebuild and am missing one cover and both flaps. Any advise would be great.
