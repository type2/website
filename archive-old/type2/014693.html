&gt; Subject: [T2] How long should it take for f.i. to start the engine?
&gt; 
&gt; My new 79 Westy seems to take at least 2 to 3 tries of 15-20 seconds
&gt; cranking before it will finally start. I was under the impression that it
&gt; should start on the first try in a couple of seconds? My 78 certainly did
&gt; ,
&gt; this one requires too much cranking in my opinion. Any comments on this,
&gt; or
&gt; am I asking too much?
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Courtney

	[Crick, Bill ]  My response for a 76.
	In summer my bus starts in three turns as in -&gt;&quot;bug bug bug vroom&quot;
	When I drove it in winter I found it could take quite long
	if you kept cranking continuously, but if you stop cranking the
first 
	time it popped, and the tried again it fired up right away. 
	Say 10 turns to first pop, and then three turns on second attempt. 
	This was true down to about -35F. I never tried starting it below
that. 

	Cheers Bill Crick
