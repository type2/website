Subject: oil light on at idle


Frank,

My oil light has always come on in the summer at hot idle.  Some oil
pressure senders come on higher than others.  This way for 30,000 miles--no
problems.

Just an indication that the engine is warm and oil is thinner--engine
clearances may not be up to DM spec.  I actually use Pennzoil HD 30 which I
think holds up better in the summer (then again I blew out my oil cooler
seals in the winter).

As long as it goes out as soon as you rev it the slightest, you shouldn't
worry.  But DO keep an eye on your temperature, be aware of the dipstick
test, if its too hot to hold, then you have other problems: timing off,
vacuum leak (lean), missing tin/seals, etc.

Good luck,

Will '70 Westy &quot;Rebertha&quot;
