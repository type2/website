Subject: Re: [T2] cam questions

Craig,

Sounds pretty good, but for a bus, you need to lose the lightweight 
flywheel.  You need the regular one, otherwise you are going to get 
a lot of &quot;bucking&quot; everytime you let up or get on the accelerator.

Sell the leftovers for big bucks and get something else.

I saved this cam site long ago...time to check it out...

http://www.amotion_dot_com/tech/camtalk.html  

Some folks claim the sp has more umph on the low end...which you need in a 
bus.  A *very* mild cam might help a little on the top end...but are you
really going to go there in a bus?

Just my opinion, dave

&gt; ok, i have nearly all the bits i need to start work on the 1700 SP T1 
&gt; motor... except the cam, and i could use opinions.
&gt; the engine is going to have a new aluminum case, machine-in 88 p/cs, 
&gt; a pauter engineering c/w 69mm crank and wedgemated, lightened 
&gt; flywheel with berg (heavy) achiever pulley, berg flow oil, SP heads 
&gt; that have some mild porting and a 3-angle valve job and some spring 
&gt; shims. likely carb is a stock 30-pict 2 or 3.
&gt; 
&gt; why all this crap? well, some i have had lying around forever, some 
&gt; came (relatively) cheaply off the internet. so while maybe not my 
&gt; dream motor - that would have a c/w 72mm crank, but having one made 
&gt; is too much $$$$ - it is going together for about the same as a 
&gt; beetlemex, and hopefully will have a bit more leg.
&gt; 
&gt; IF i get a good cam!  now, the votes have been pretty much even on 
&gt; stock vs aftermarket. the two votes for stock that i put the most 
&gt; weight in are tim at gene berg and todd at rimco; both state &quot;stock 
&gt; carb/stock cam,&quot; period. they also stated that SP heads won't flow 
&gt; enough no matter what you do to take advantage of hotter grinds. btw, 
&gt; i like SP's for busses, so that's why i'm currently sticking with 
&gt; them.
&gt; 
&gt; two heavy votes for bump it are from schneider cams and ronnie 
&gt; oldvolks, with a lesser vote from cbperformance; now, i know grinders 
&gt; want to sell me something, but they seemed to have good rationale.
&gt;   schneider has a very mild cam 
&gt; http://www.schneidercams_dot_com/cams/107.htm, the 248-4f that he 
&gt; explained allowed a bit more time for air to fill the cylinders, but 
&gt; didn't A) keep the exhausts open long enough to scavenge the charge 
&gt; or B) have so high a lift to do.... whatever the heck lift does! 
&gt; (some cam talk i get, some i am learning, and some is math :P  ).
&gt; cbp has a similar, slightly hotter cam - 
&gt; http://www.cbperformance_dot_com/catalog.asp?ProductID=53  . ronnie has 
&gt; been talking to a grinder about the ultimate bus cam, but it won't 
&gt; come in time to help me....
&gt; 
&gt; keep in mind i want to keep the lowend torque, fill the cylinders a 
&gt; bit more than the stock cam,  and keepa decent idle , NOT worry about 
&gt; high rpms or screamin' off the line.
&gt; 
&gt; ronnie says he built this exact engine for a customer with the cbp 
&gt; stick - does that person want to post their experiences?
&gt; 
&gt; while a voice inside of me is going 'stock! stock!'  i do fear that 
&gt; if i hate the performance of the stock cam i will have to take it 
&gt; apart and replace it. only out-and-out advantage of a hotter cam is 
&gt; that if i hate it, i can pick out a set of these DP heads and  baby 
&gt; dells lying underfoot and put em to use...  i might still hate it, 
&gt; but an easier experiment than tearing down the block!!
&gt; 
&gt; footnote - bob hoover stated to 'put in a subaru 1800' bless his 
&gt; heart.  but his basic (much appreciated,bob) answer was that stock 
&gt; was the way to go, unless i wanted to have a custom ground cam and 
&gt; experiment. i'll let ronnie do that  :)
