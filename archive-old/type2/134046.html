Subject: torque dude review

i had gone to the phoenix bug show for just one purpose - to get a 
tool for torquing gland nuts properly, be it a honkin' big click 
wrench or a torque meister (r) tool.

found some guys selling a similar item called the torque dude... $50. 
bought one.

well, i am not impressed. i had a discussion with the seller about 
breakage, as it is cast in taiwan; he gave me a card and guaranteed 
it wouldn't break.
well, he's getting a call monday, cuz it didn't break, but it didn't 
work, either.

got everything ready. locked the flywheel, loctite on the nut - my 
torque wrench is an inchpounds one, so to get my desired 35 ft lbs on 
the torque dude i needed to go to 420 in. pounds. this would give me 
about 315 ft lbs at the nut. i'm using the berg HD nut, btw.
sadly, everytime i approached 300 in/lbs, the torque dude cog woud 
lift and walk out of the flywheel gears; i made trebly sure the tool 
was seated on the nut and firmly in the fw teeth, but no go. i'm not 
sure what exactly is flexing, the cog or the arm, but the metal is 
too weak to take the strain. crapass lowcarbon metal. cast iron for 
all i know.

took my 3' homedepot cheater pipe, my 30 yr old us-made thorsen 1/2&quot; 
ratchet, and put the nut on the same way i took it off - leaning on 
the pipe about 2' from center.   thought i'd  use the TDude on the 
nut afterwards to see if i could at least get an estimate of how much 
torque i'd applied, but it walked again. pffft.

has anyone used a torque MEISTER and had good results? any tips to 
improve my efforts before i fling the tool into the desert?
