actually that colour upholstery  (mesh grey)  came in all 65s and in
non-deluxe 66 and 67s, except ivory commercial vehicles. 

The seat frame would be either for 62-66, or 67, which has a one year only
middle seat frame.

nice mesh grey seats are very hard to find, as the material gets dry and
cracks and rips.     The older 'leatherette' holds up better.   Mesh platinum
(the 'gold s&amp;p') are even harder to find, as they were on fewer buses, and as
well as ripping, the colour changes in the sunlight, to a copperu colour.
  Front seats nice are near impossible to find.  happy hunting.
