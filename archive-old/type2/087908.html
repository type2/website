Subject: Re: sundial musings

I had a 65 sundial that I drove across country. It was a California car
and had the sundial badge and the California RV badge on the passenger's
side dog leg. Check out: http://marcus.schaper_dot_com/en/cars/vw.htm 

It's a shame that it burnt up (check those fuel lines !!!!) - it had
cargo doors on both sides and was entirely rust-free ...

In checking for sundial info, I re-read the type 2 library's interview
with
the gent who used to work for sundial. Couple of things jumped out, he
mentioned the dealership was in Vancouver BC and they started in the
early
70's. A big huh? I always thought they were a US company and started
producing in the early 60's. Can anybody shed some light.
