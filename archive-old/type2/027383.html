&quot;Hiles, TJ&quot; &lt;TJHiles_at_wheatlandtitle_dot_com&gt; asked:
&gt;&gt;Someone on the list has to know this. What is the correct timing for a 73 
&gt;&gt;thing engine (code AM 008063)?  &lt;&lt;

The collective wisdom of this list told me that you set timing per the 
distributor you have, NOT your engine.  I was pointed to the Library at 
type2_dot_com and found the procedure for mine.

A backfire on deceleration usually means you have an exhaust leak.  I must 
admit here that my camper is my first forray into aircooled boxer engines 
with short exhaust runs and I'm not sure of all the places an exhaust leak 
could &quot;hide&quot; from you, but perhaps if it's not obvious, at a flange for 
instance, maybe it's inside one of the heat exchangers?
