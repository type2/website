Subject: Re: [T2] Ben's Carbs


&gt;I know there have to be stock rebuilders and aftermarket solutions in the
&gt;single and dual carbs.  Anyone got an opinion? Recommendations of someone
&gt;who does a *good* job of rebuilding the stock carbs? (*really* clean and
&gt;new throttle shaft bushings)

I have heard alot of good about the &quot;carb&quot; hospital in England. Dunno what 
the cost is but to me it would be worth spending a couple hundred bucks for 
a &quot;new&quot; carb that would last years and years.


Ciao!
