The key phrase here is &quot;properly prepared&quot;!  One that should be added
is &quot;proper use&quot;.

JB Weld is a very good 2-part epoxy that happens to be resistant to the
various fluids we use in our vehicles.  Unfortunately, the marketing
people at the JB company seem to promise that the stuff is a
replacement for every material you have in a car, including steel!

Yep, you can drill and machine cured JB-Weld, but it's still plastic!

JB is great for sealing cracks in rigid or semi-rigid materials, and
for gluing those same materials.  The surfaces have to be clean and dry
before applying the JB.  I've used JB on carb inlets (to glue and seal
the tubes), on RV holding tanks (to seal cracks), and to glue plastic
to metal in a gasoline environment.

I would _never_ use JB in any primary structural application, or to
glue flexible materials.  To do so is to ask for failure.
