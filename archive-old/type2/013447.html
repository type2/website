Subject: Quick Bus Story...
Date: Wed, 6 Jun 2001 09:49:10 US/Mountain

Had some fun yesterday.  A friend of mine is doing a bunch of landscaping and 
I'm helping her.  She recently bought a new Mazda Tribute SUV (BTW, it's a VERY 
nice, comfortable, capable vehicle!) and has been very cocky about how it can 
do everything so well.

Yesterday we went to Home Depot to buy a bunch of those pie-shaped bricks that 
you use to build retaining walls.  They weigh about 25 pounds each and we 
bought 120 of them.  I put 75 of them (1875 lbs!) in my 73 Westy.  Most of them 
went on the floor in the middle of the bus so I was balanced fairly well.  The 
other 45 (a mere 1125 lbs) went into her SUV.  The bus looked almost normal 
sitting there, but her SUV looked VERY weighted down.  She and the Home Depot 
guy that helped us load were both very impressed.  Then I proceeded to (mostly)
keep up with her up the long steep hill to her house.  The 2.0 FI motor and 
gearing in my 5-sp tranny really came in handy for that!

She's going camping with me this weekend for the first time.  Maybe she'll 
become a bus-fanatic too?

Happy motoring.
