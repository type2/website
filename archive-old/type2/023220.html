Subject: Casper Copped a Tent !!
Mime-Version: 1.0

Working my rear end off this end past few days getting ready for 2001, A 
Bus Odyssey !

So far, I have managed to get done in the past few day, the following:

New Headliner installed with &quot;space style&quot; insulation above the headliner,
Mounted a set of &quot;over the rear table&quot; style dual lights up by driver &amp; 
passenger area.
Fuel tank POR15 treated and is curing up.
Cleaned carburetor.
Rebuilt several distributors.
Replaced all CV boots and greased.
Replaced Rubber bushings on rear end torsion arms.
New Real wheel bearings.
Replaced main engine seal.
Installed &quot;hot start&quot; relay system, and dual battery charge system.
Cataloging and boxing all necessary spares and tools list being checked 
twice over.

With all this going on in the driveway, Mary Beth knew when to get out of 
here. She took the cats up to Bradford, PA to farm them out with our niece 
and nephew and their children.

Now the Great Part ........... Tah Dah !!!!!!!
Just got as call from my wonderful wife.
Mary Beth has found an original issue 1971 tent that has never been used, 
and has been meticulously stored by one of her old instructors.
She thinks she can get it for free.

Even bringing me back home a jar of sharp New York horseradish, and jar of 
cherry preserves to pack along with us for our trip. Whatta Girl !!
