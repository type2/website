Subject: Re: CV Joint separation from axle shaft

Been a while since I did this, but my trick to allow even force on the
CV is to place it so the cv joint STRADDLES the open jaws of a very big
vise, with the other end hanging down.  Close the jaws enough so the
force is on the center of the joint, not the sides.  Then I used an old
solid lifter or something similar as a punch and whacked on the shaft to
drive it out.
