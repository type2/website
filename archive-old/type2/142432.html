&gt;The time has come to replace the brake pads on Ursula, my '85 Westy.  All of
&gt;the parts have arrived from Bus Depot (thanks Ron!) and I was ready to get
&gt;down to business.  When I opened the hardware kit for the front brakes there
&gt;was a little pouch of silicone lubricant along with all the other bits and
&gt;pieces.  Now I could be crazy, but somehow the thought of putting lubricant
&gt;near my brakes just seems a bit stupid...  A look thru my Bentley and Haynes
&gt;manuals along with a quick review of the archives left me with more answers
&gt;than questions, so I thought I would check in to see what the latest
&gt;thinking in whether or not to use the lube, or just go with dry assembly.

The lube usually goes between the backing plate and the pad on the front brakes.
