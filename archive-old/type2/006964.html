in my search for a correct distributor, i think i found one that will work.  
it needs to be rebuilt.  i have never done this, dont have any info on how to 
do it, where to get the rebuild kit (if there is one available).  

on checking the archives, and the library i found the oldvolkshome www site, 
but it seems to be not functioning, is there somewhere else i can go to have 
this distributor rebuilt professionally??  there seems to be no where local 
that does it either.....any suggestions??
