Hi Volks,

Several months back, I overhauled my brake system including installing a new
master cylinder. When I speak of overhaul, I had the front rotators turned
and put new hubs, installed new wheel cylinders and brake lining on the
rears.  Recently I have had two situations pop up which I am seeking some
thoughts on.  My first problem is that at times, I have a hard brake pedal
initially as I start to brake, as I apply pressure, the brake pedal will go
down an inch or so, not much more than that and become soft.  There has been
times also that the brake pedal remains hard and will not go down. The
braking action still remains good.  I have read Bentleys theory on brake
problems.  I was wondering for those that I have more experiences in this
area than I, if I should go directly to the (1) brake servo and replace it;
(2) take off the soft lines from the vacuum check valve and brake servo and
replace them; or (3) replace the vacuum check valve. If one of the answers
is to replace the brake servo, what is the cost and availability. This
problem is on a 79 Transporter. Thanks
