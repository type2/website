Subject: isolators and regulator info - Thanks Guys!

I've got it , I understand now whats shaking.
I will go pick up a relay and do the deed.

Finally!

And this also taught me that the idiot shop who I paid good
money to wire my isolator into the van (and as it happened my
alternator had to be replaced as it started putting out 18v shortly
there after (and it wasn't the regulator))
wired the isolator in as a relay - coincidence, who knows.

Thanks
I've been struggling with how the wiring works in this
instance and it now seems pretty simple.

James
