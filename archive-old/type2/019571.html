Subject: Re: Charcoal Cannister

Don Martin wrote, among other things:

&quot;I put the following into our 73 Westy (Lily) about 2 weeks and 600
miles ago:
- 78 type 4 engine (hydraulic lifters)
- 76 fuel injection (minus the charcoal vent canister)&quot;

My questions:

(1) Why no charcoal cannister?  perhaps because your fan housing lacks
the outlet to provide flow into the cannister?  Do you see an advantage
to not having the cannister?
(2) Where do you route the vent lines to in lieu of the charcoal
cannister?  Or do you just plug them and vent at the filler cap?
