&gt; I am checking the timing on my '71 camper van.  1600 DP 
&gt; engine,  34PICT 3 Solex carb, vacuum advance dizzy
&gt;  (023 117 036).  The pulley has 2 timing marks.  A v-shaped
&gt; notch on the front (fif) of the pulley, and at about 5 deg to the
&gt; left of that notch is a round indention on the back of the
&gt; pulley.  I am guessing that the v-shaped notch is TDC and the
&gt; round indention is 5 deg ATDC.

No, it's the other way around.  The round indentation on the aft edge of
the pulley is TDC and the notch on the forward edge of the pulley is 5
degrees ATDC.  The pulley rotates clockwise, and it's logical that the TDC
mark will pass by before the ATDC mark.  You time to the notch on the
leading edge of the pulley.

  Bently says the '71 should
&gt; be timed at 5 deg ATDC.  Does anyone know if my 
&gt; assumptions about the notch and indention are correct?  If
&gt; I am correct, then my timing is incorrect.  I would think that 
&gt; the round indention (5 deg ATDC?) should line up with the
&gt; split in the crank case when the timing light fires.  Right now
&gt; the v-notch is about 1 inch to the left of the crank case split
&gt; when the timing light fires.&gt;                                                  Bill &amp; Janyce

Sounds like the timing is set to about 5 BTDC.

Different distributors have different settings.  You want to see about 28
degrees of total advance when it is all in.  The 5 ATDC setting is for the
stock distributor, and I don't have my reference handy to see if your
number matches.  Other distributors are set to as much as 10 degrees BTDC.
