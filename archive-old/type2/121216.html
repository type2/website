&gt;After some luck searching I found the link referenced
&gt;http://www.nls_dot_net/mp/volks/htm/plug.htm. But it does not shed any more light

&gt;maybe I can get a data sheet and build a front end to a multi-meter to be
&gt;used as a TDC tool.

I've wondered if the sensor fires only when the engine is running rather than when it's aligned with the flywheel.

Something I've wanted to do for a long time is hook up that sensor and the coil to a scope and compare the difference in angle between the spark and the sensor to accurately set the advance if the sensor is cooperative.
