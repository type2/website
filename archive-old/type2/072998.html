Subject: To Rebuild or to drop in a new one

Hi all,

well at the very leat I need a valve job on my 74 bus Automatic w/fuil
injection.  Now I'm no wizz with rebuilding engines (I can only rebuild 2
stroke motors at this point).  Now do I pay about $1k for a rebuild on the
valves and maybe find out the engine also needs a rebuild for another 1k.
Or do I just go buy a rebuild and drop it in?

Many thanks,
