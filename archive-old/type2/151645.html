Subject: Re: [T2] Doghouse additional oil cooler or not ?

Arnaud,

I pondered long before replying to this.

IIRC, what Gene Berg says as well is that you don't need an external oil 
cooler to fix a problem that shouldn't exsist to start with.

With that being said, it's obvious that you and the other fellow have a 
problem keeping your oil cool.

I firmly believe that you *can* keep a vw engine cool with the stock 
components if they are in good shape.  All the &quot;t's&quot; crossed and all the 
&quot;i's&quot; dotted.

?something? is not right on your engine...the question is, what in the 
heck is it?  Which brings me to the dilema that a lot of newbie VW folks 
face.  How do you *know* all the tin is there if you are new to the car 
and engine and don't have 30+ years experience working on them.

Which brings to mind....have you checked for the air flow deflectors in 
your engine?...the ones underneath each pair of cylinders and above the 
push rod tubes?

The next question for your engine is this....is it getting hot because:

1. Cooling air not getting where is should in the correct volume?(leaks)
2. Cooling air is not cool?(recirculating air that is already hot)
3. Oil cooler/relief valve not operating correctly?

Those are the larger issues....take them one by one and do the easiest 
first.  Like the filter /tube on top of your fan shroud...sealed it off 
yet?...even though it doesn't seem like much air is being lost there, 
every part has to work together.  What about spark plug seals?

Run your hand lightly over those areas...air being lost?

#2 above is harder....when you stop and the engine isrunning hot, is the 
fan shroud hot?(are you sucking hot air from someplace that you are not 
aware of?)

#3 above, whew!  I haven't the faintest idea of how to test that one 
without a lot of instrumentation ...wow, just thought of something....if 
you have your digital turkey thermometer in the outlet airflow from the 
oil cooler, what does it read when the engine is getting &quot;hot&quot;.  If it 
isn't someplace close to 200? degrees or so when you hit the part in your 
bus where it gets hot...then something is wrong....not enough airflow, or 
not enough oil flow...something is off.

To me, this is an interesting problem....time to rock back on your heels 
with an adult beverage and just look at your engine....to the zen thing 
and become one with it and figure it out!

You already checked that the head and cylinder fins were clean when you 
had it apart before, so we know the air passage ways are ok.

I tried an external cooler once, didn't like it....the thought of all 
those rubber hoses carrying heat and pressure really bothered me and I 
really didn't think it worked all that well....see second line from the 
top!

Of course, your mileage will vary, but I really think you should be able 
to get your temps down unless there is something wrong inside.  Maybe pull 
the bottom tin off and go for a  test run and check temps on each 
individual cylinder with that new infrared last temp taker you were going 
to get....once cylinder way hotter than another?

Please let us know what you find!

Cheers, dave

 By now many know that oil gets hot in my 1971 bus. Since much of the

&gt; Here is what the gurus say in this domain
&gt; 
&gt; Bob Hoover says that stock doghouse oil cooler is good for engines up
&gt; to 2000cc (not specifying bus or lighter body)

&gt; 
&gt; Gene Berg says that doghouse is good for daily driver up to 200HP and
&gt; does not encourage external oil cooler (not specifying bus or lighter
&gt; body)

lots snipped.

&gt; 
&gt; This is an &quot;A la Van Ness&quot; setup. Opinions ? Warnings ?!?
