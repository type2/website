Travis and List,

I don't know if you'll be anywhere near Stockton, Ca. on your trip,
but if so, I recommend Don's Buggy Shop.

On my recent move, I blew my oil cooler and subsequently, my tranny
(as I was pulling into the above mentioned repair shop!!!) outside of
Stockton and found Don's in the yellow pages. He installed a good used
tranny, a new doghouse cooler, rebuilt a seriously leaking carburetor,
replaced my fuel lines/clamps and replaced a warped fan, all for
$500.00. This included pulling the motor twice, as the warped fan was
missed the first time.

I truly cannot say enough good things about those guys; they could
have really stuck it to me but they were honest.
