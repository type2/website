I am trading out my  rivera top on my bus for a hightop...
  gotta take a trip to do so and want to leave my now pop top behind to cut down on weight and also the hassle...of having to pull a trailer to tote back...
   
   
  what can i put safely and leak resistant possibly on the top covering hole/s until i get to destination....?
   
  i thought about sheet metal screwing a sheet of plywood down but surely something else is better....the plywood would get soggy if i hit hard rain.... i cant afford to loose time sitting under a bridge like i used to do on my motorcycle i use to ride everywhere before married.
   
   a sheet of plastic and duct tape would look like a balloon....and might not last torn by the wind or flying debree ..?
   
  so what would be a good solution to put over the hole in the top?
   
  ay ideas without hacking up the bus sheet metal screws will be covered by the hightop later on.
   
  plan on just strapping the top down with straps for trip back...
  might add a few sheet metal screws since that is how it was last attached to the bus it came from...\
   
  thinking safety..
   
  thanks
