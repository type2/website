Subject: Re: [T2] Our Köln Side tent arrived from BusDepot today

Dave, you're my hero! ;-)

I wanted to get in on that deal soooo bad but lack of $$ prevented it. :(

I've been considering getting one of those RV type shades that rolls up and 
mounts to the side of the bus. I see them for pretty cheap every so often... 
Anybody gotten one of those? Work well?
