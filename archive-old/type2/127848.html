Subject: Re: Oil leak of the damned

&gt; - covering the entire end of the crankshaft, the seal, the washer, and the
&gt; mating surface between the fan and the hub with silicone
&gt; 
&gt; RESPONSE:
&gt; Put down the silicone!!!  Back away slowly. 
&gt; Don't move your hands....

Ya, I know, that one was a little extreme...  Some people recommended it to
me, though, and I was getting a little desperate at that point.  I'll get it
all cleaned off there.  I promise.  :)

&gt; You seem to have the oil leak isolated... and you seem to know that
&gt; silicone will never help and probably hurts.  You know what you have to
&gt; do, right?

Err, no.  Actually, that's why I was posting...  the only thing I could
think of was replacing the o-ring, but that didn't make any difference.  Do
you know what might actually be causing it?
