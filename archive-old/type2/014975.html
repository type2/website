&gt;I guess that I'll bend to the &quot;conventional wisdom&quot; though the actual &quot;proof&quot;
&gt;would be a walk through the type 2 microfiche.  If VW supplied them, then I'd
&gt;go for it, if not, I'd reset the torsion bars.

Jim, I want you to know honestly that is the route I tried to take first.
Over a period of several years I have probably inquired of a dozen VW
mechanics about adjusting the rear torsion bars.  All but one flatly
refused to do the job.  The one who would do the job would do so only if
factory-new torsion bars were used.  I also inquired of three dealerships
all of whom refused.

A common thread in the converstions with all the mechanics was their
opinion that old torsion bars SHOULD NOT BE adjusted.  All of them sited
the fact that after being adjusted, the old torsion bars would be subjected
to stresses greater than before adjustment, and that some torsion bars
would break when subjected to this.
