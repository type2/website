Subject: Fair price to rent a bus

Hi Volks...

Been saving this up for a Friday....so here goes...

What about a bus exchange program among the list...someone from CA wants
to holiday in Canada...I loan them my bus to them...when I want to
holiday in CA, they loan theirs to me...

Or maybe we could do it on a rental basis...have a list like the airs
list for people who would be interested to rent their bus to a fellow
listee.....or his/her family

What do y'all think??

Den..
