&gt;Howdy - Are there any Listees out there who have replaced the blower
motor on their '76? I've detemined that the relay for the motor works
and 12 V is present on the motor wires, but it doesn't turn. If I nudge
the blower fan (with a tool - lots of torque here!), it will turn over
for a few revs and stop again

Recently started a blower on our cheapie camper...that had your exact
symptoms. Sprayed a little WD-40...or maybe PB Blaster on the thing as I
spun it. About 3 cycles of this..and it has been freed up for about 1K now.
