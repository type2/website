Subject: VW S&amp;R comes to my house

yes, today, the VW Search and Rescue came to chez moi.

 The phone rings this morning, it's the guy who said he was going to buy  the
72 over a month ago, but this time he is ready to come get it. 

72?? you say.  Yes, 72.   A verified bubble window bus, that would have been
a pancaker too, had not some PO installed a homemade 1600 conversion kit.
  This spring a friend called and said his aprtment manager was  going to tow
it away, (the motor was worn out and reg expired), so a couple friends and I
towed it over here.  And it has since sat.

It's savig grace it's its almost completely rust free body.   Lift up the
rear floor mat, and you see ......  paint!!!!  no rust!   bus driven by the
PO from so Cal.  Okay, the drivers window doesnt wind, and the rear side
windows have Local Motion etched in them, but it it straight and has decent
(light blue and white) paint.   You can't just let something like that get
smushed.

So   he and a couple friends show up shortly with a motor and battery, we do
the spare tire dance, and pull the old motor ( I wanted to keep it as a core
- - doghouse stuff you know).   

Meanwhile  I start up the 53, and as it is a sunny day  with dry roads  three
of us (leaving Jason toiliing on his new bus) take a little spin to the gas
station and to  the FLAPS for oil.    Zack gets to crank start the bus
leaving the FLAPS.    A nice drive, and the beast likes it too.    I changed
the oil when we get back.   Took out the master cylinder too (it was a later
splitty one), to put it in the 65 camper, as the camper's leaks and since
aquiring the 53 have found the correct master cylinder.

And while I'm under there, I hear the sound of a running motor.  It stalls.
  Anyway, after a bit of fiddling, they drive away, leaving  my motor and a
pile of leaves in the driveway.  i'm glad it went to a good home, he was very
happy with it.

Clara
