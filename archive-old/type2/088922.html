My $.02

With several years of work in or around boatyard, I would recommend =
these
LPU products HIGHLY, regardless of their cost.  A well done paintjob on =
a
boat will look good for ten years, including it sitting in salt water =
for
all of that.  However, it doesn't look nearly as good when brushed or =
rolled
as when sprayed.  If you don't mind the cost of this paint and you live
somewhere where the feds (or neighbors) won't haul you away for spraying =
in
your backyard, go buy a sprayer from craftsman for $100 and borrow a
compressor.  Lifetime warrantee, so you know it will work in ten years =
when
you paint again...

FYI, West Marine has commercial accounts as well, so if you have a =
friend in
the boating business, you may be able to save 25%.  And whatever you do,
just buy things ONLY available in marine stores from these places.  =
They're
not cheap.
