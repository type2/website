I've had excellent results carrying everything from a fiberglass boat to loads 
of plywood, etc., on a modified gutter-mount ski rack.

The rack is an older A&amp;T with steel crossbars and mounting hardware.  I added 
1&quot;X4&quot; wood slats to the crossbars, and used wood blocks to raise the bars high 
enough to clear the poptop on our 1970 Campmobile.  The gutter clamps have 
about a 4&quot; wide base and tighten with wingnuts.

If we need to raise the poptop at night when traveling it only takes a minute 
to dismount the rack and stow it under the bus.

We've carried multiple sheets of 1&quot; plywood for nearly 400 miles on this rack, 
a load approaching 250 lbs., with absolutely no problems of any kind.

I'd be very leery of a poptop-mounted rack with any significant load.  There 
are several campers in our area with these racks that carry bikes, snowboards, 
and skis, and they're all late '70s buses.  Every one we see has cracks in the 
fiberglass around the rack mounts.

I think you'll find that raising any poptop with a load on top is difficult, 
if not downright dangerous.  If you'll have to remove the rack anyway, why 
jeopardize the fiberglass poptop when you have steel gutters available?

FWIW.....

Subject: 	Pop-Top Rack

I want to install a surf rack to the top of my 1970 westy  pop-top. Sounds 
easy, Not so, I park  in a garage and only have 2 inches of clearance now. So 
the rack  will have to be portable. For local stuff  I put my boards inside 
with bed down. Someone told me they saw a bracket (like the shape of a roof 
gutter) permanently mounted to fiberglass top, then a gutter mounted rack 
mounted to that. Has anyone done something like this with a rack. I am 
thinking of making a stainless or aluminum bracket, any thoughts?
