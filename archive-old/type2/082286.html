&gt; Now if you talking about rivited rats--that's another story--they never
&gt; had any welds from the get go-----( Peterbuilt, Kenworth, etc)
&gt; So why in the heck woud one want to be gluing a rivited truck in the
&gt; first place?

Ask AM General. The HMMWV bodies are made of aluminum that's glued then
riveted. &gt;&gt;

So's the frame for the biggest change for the Morgan Motor Company
since they went to four wheels in '36...The Aero 8.
Although, as far as bus body restoration goes I'd love to replace all the
doors with light(er) bonded and riveted aluminum - as I'm sure the engine
would appreciate it too ;-)
