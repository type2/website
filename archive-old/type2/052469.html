&gt; I have new, original equipment German mirrors for $24.95 each. They don't
&gt; rust out quickly as the Mexican ones do.

I have had a set of these on my '71 for several years now and Ron's right.
No rust.  However the plastic beading between the glass and the metal is
cracking from the UV exposure.  I;ll have to find a replacement bead
material or simply silicone the glass into place.

Still, I'm happy with the part.
