Urewelcome,
  I just got through putting in a new fuel pump myself. I
also had to put an in-line filter in the system on the
outlet of the fuel tank as the outlet tube is the same size
as the carb line but the inlet to the pump is larger.
According to my local mech. there used to be a hose
available that was made for this application. One end
larger than the other (go figure eh!). In othe words I came
off the tank with a short length of the smaller diameter
hose into the filter (which can accept either diameter as
it steps up). then from the filter I ran the larger
diameter hose to the pump inlet. Then I ran the smaller
stuff up to the &quot;T&quot; for my carbs (dual carb). Also make
sure you have a length of hose on the that third tube on
the pump. It is the weep hole for your pump and if the
diaphram in the pump starts to leak that is where your gas
goes.(I didnt know this) Mine was dripping on to the
heaterbox tin. I now have a length of hose on it to direct
it down and away from the engine tin. I stuck a short piece
of coat hanger wire into the fuel line on this weep outlet.
I then bent the wire so it keeps the hose pointed away from
the engine. May sound extreme but I came close to a flame
on because I had raw gas dripping into the heater box area.
There was a constant gas smell that went away when the
engine heated up... I looked for a long time before I found
the problem. I suspected a sticky float/choke in the carbs
cause I could never find the source untill last Monday. I
got lucky!

&gt; &gt; The small tube outlet goes to the carbs and the larger
&gt; one
&gt; &gt; (inlet) goes to the tank... least on my 74... I think
&gt; they
&gt; &gt; are the same pump. Make sense?
