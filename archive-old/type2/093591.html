Subject: Re: [T2] Longest wire.

Well I started thinking, the longest wire would be from the front right indicator to rear right indicator.
But then I noticed you didn't say electrical wire so I thought prehaps one of the wires that are twisted together to form the clutch cable. 
Hang on a minute you included Westy conversions as well as stock transporters so it could be the wire spring in the seal around the rising roof.
But even the winding on the coil of a relay would be longer than these.
But for my final answer I would have to go for one of the windings in the starter, alternator or coil.
I think I will go for the HT winding of the coil, at a quess 50,000 feet or 16,000 metres

Good luck

&gt; Q: Which is the longest wire in the VW late bay bus/westy?  (extra points if 
&gt; you can tell how long it is without measuring)
