Subject: Administrivia - Second try - List finances

Volks,

Well, that didn't come out reading quite like I intended :-)  As I (and
others) read it, I didn't mean that the idea of a raffle was not a good
one, nor that contributions should be limited to once a year, just that we
are not in dire straits. By all means a fund-raiser for the list is a good
thing, and will postpone my plan for a March &quot;beg week&quot; by however much is
raised.

At the same time, contributions are to the list, not to me. This list is
entirely non-profit, run by volunteers for the mutual benefit of all.  I
am only one of the volunteers; Ken Hooper, Thom Fitzpatrick, David
Raistrick, Ron Van Ness, Steve Gutknecht, George Lyle, Sean Bartnik and a
host of other people all deserve a round of applause for their work and
contributions!  The list is not &quot;sponsored&quot; by anyone, tho vendors,
amateur and professional are welcomed and encouraged.  The web site does
not have any &quot;banner&quot; ads and we don't sell anything ourselves (OK, the
occasion used part :-).

The address for contributions remains:

                   H Steven Dolan
                   2906 Commonwealth Avenue
                   Alexandria, VA  22305


                           H Steven Dolan
			   Co-administrator, type2 list
