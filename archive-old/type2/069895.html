&gt;These are the regular maintenace things.  I also did some other
&gt;things:  I have a breather hose (I think that is what it is called)
&gt;that goes from the bottom of my air cleaner on the carb to the oil
&gt;breather on the engine (you may or may not have this on your engine,
&gt;did you say a 71?).  This had a leak in it where it attatched to the
&gt;air cleaner, so I took care of that.

I don't know what his problem is, but it's not that. ;) That's just the
crankcase breather. 71 definitely has this. Very good form to have it
hooked up (why waste perfectly good VOCs?) but it won't make a bit of
difference in your idle.
