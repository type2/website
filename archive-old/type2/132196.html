&gt;&gt; But I am 
&gt;&gt; going to look for something else. I do have some sheet cork. But I think I
&gt;&gt; can track done some sheet rubber. Oh well.
&gt; 
&gt; The original was a fibre like cardboard that was pretty thick. I've found
&gt; similar stuff at the hardware store in small 4'x4' sheets. The expensive
&gt; gaskets the dealer sells are now cork.

These are not cork, at least not the ones we sell. They are a very thick
fibrous material. They are genuine VW. That said, I think cork will work
fine. The shape of them is odd, they are not rectangular due to the way they
curl around on one end but are almost flat on the other. Some day I may make
a rule die to cut these myself, because the VW price for them is too high.

There is a cork gasket in the heater box, where is goes around the shroud,
which is always missing also. The dansk heater boxes have the groove for the
cork, but not the cork gasket itself. The NOS VW heater boxes that we have a
few of all have the cork. When I install heater boxes on a bus I make the
cork gaskets from pieces of valve cover gasket.
