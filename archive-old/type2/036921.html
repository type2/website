Subject: Re: Engine builder on east coast

&gt; Hi,
&gt; I seem to recall someone mentioning a VW engine builder in New England.
Can someone please advise this
&gt; companies information or another engine builder on the east coast.

I have no personal experience but he has a good rep. www.bostonengine_dot_com
