Subject: [T2] Temp 2 Stand-off Prototype

This posting might surprise you.
     
I have embarked on a &quot;reinvent the wheel&quot; project to
fabricate 022-133-079 Temperature 2 Stand-off parts. 
We are using Aluminum Hex bar stock.  I have SWAG'ed
the dimensions, and will test the first couple of
machined look-alikes.  I've found microfiche pictures
of this stand-off.  But does anyone have a blue-print
i.e. dimensions?  When I move from alpha to beta, are
their some T2 list members who would like to
test-drive the proto's?
   
I'm trained as a Mechanical Engineer, although I put
food on the table by running Data Processing
departments.  After this Temperature 2 Stand-off
project is nailed, I'm considering going into Butyl
Rubber fabrication of the imfamous T2 75 to 83 FI &quot;S&quot;
hose.  So the T2 thread about microcracks in the &quot;S&quot;
hose, could become moot in the coming months.
     
All of my motivation here is to do what is right for
my T2.  But I'm not beyond cloning and marketing my
solutions to recover dev costs.
