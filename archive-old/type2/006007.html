Hey folks-

I need a little advice for the update to the VW Heat-Rust-Noise site.

I am ready to create a couple of comparative sound files to the site: e.g. 
the sound of a bus on the road WITHOUT the insulation, and the sound WITH. 
Sound of the motor without balancing and a counterweighted crank, and the 
sound with, etc. I am not sure how to do that.

I will describe how I THINK it works, and hopefully one of you web 
demagogues can descend to my level, and confirm or explain.

1. Record sound with regular ol' stereo cassette tape deck.
2. Patch tape deck output into computer's sound input thingy (not the 
microphone hole, the other &quot;sound comes in here&quot; thing)
3. (Here is where I am a little unclear) Somehow, get Soundo'LE, my sound 
processing tool, to find the incoming sound, and record it in &quot;radio&quot; 
quality (should that be 11,025 hz or 22,050 hz?), as a .wav file.
4. Insert the .wav file in the site (yes, I am still building with 
MSWord97) with an icon on the page hyperlinked to the file.
5. Hope it works.

I know one of our Vanagon folks has sound on his site...a Vanagon 
accelerating off with the narrator announcing drolly, &quot;Dave's van&quot;... 
vvvvvvVVVRRRRRRRRRRRROOOOOOOOOOM!

Any help would be appreciated.
