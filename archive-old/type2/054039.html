Subject: 76 bus runnin' real rich

Hello
I'm trying to figure out why my new 76 Westy is burning so much gas. I
replaced a bad fuel regulator last month and have been running FI
cleaner through it ever since. I seem to be getting less than 10 MPG!

I popped the top of the AFM and measured the voltage at idle. The
voltages measured with reference to ground startng with the fuel pump
switch are: 
13V  (fuel pump switch)
0V    (Lo end of potentiometer)
11V
7V    (Hi end of potentiometer)
4V    (wiper of potentiometer)
4.6

I seemed to recall that the voltage applied across the pot was only 5
VDC. The 7 VDC measured across the pot and the 4 V reading on the wiper
at idle (approx 800 RPM) seem quite high to me . 

Can anyone give me an idea on whether these readings sound reasonable
or not?

Thanks

Gary
