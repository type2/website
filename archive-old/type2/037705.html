Subject: GL-5 - nuts!

All the talk about tranny oil finally got me to go the garage and look-see
what I put in last year.  Sure enough, Gl-5.  So, what do I do now?  Drain
and replace is easy, but do I need to flush out the old?  With what?
Somebody please tell me I don't have to drop the tranny and split the case
for the flush.  I think I could make up a pretty effective flush system with
compressed air and a solvent if need be, but would some old hand please tell
me how much trouble I'm in?

Thanks.
