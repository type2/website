Subject: MPH/Top Speed

I guess I'm the old fuddy-duddy here. I have NEVER pushed it up to 80mph in
any traffic/road conditions; only rarely as high as 70, and that for only
seconds, not minutes or hours. My max cruising speed is 55-60mph no matter
where I'm driving.

I have a 74 bay with an AVP 1.8ltr running a weber single carb. I put 45,000
miles on this bus with not one on-the-road breakdown, either in daily driver
service or on long (1000+ mile) trips. I generally get 15-16 mpg around town
and 20-22 on the highway with regular gas.

I've also heard all the stories about getting rear ended or run off the road
in city traffic if you don't run 75 or 80 mph. From my experience I have to
call *BS* on this one. I have driven my bus through Detroit, Nashville,
Cincinatti, Atlanta, and Indianapolis at peak rush hours while not exceeding
60mph without incident. Plenty of hand gestures and bad language, but no
incidents. Of course, I adjust my driving style to my speed, making sure to
give way to the other drivers.

 Just go ahead and admit that you like to drive fast and don't like traffic
passing you; don't blame it on the other drivers. ;-)

My $.02, and worth every penny.
Dave
