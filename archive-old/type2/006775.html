Hello everyone!
                          And sorry for the length, but I'm so happy!
     So yesterday I wake up to get ready for work, and on the table
their is an ad in the thrifty nickel circled, Rare bus tent, excellent
condition, $275 obo, I figured great this ad is a day old now, so it
will be gone. I got ready for work was about to leave, when my mom said
just call for the heck of it, so I did, and it was still available, I
told the lady that I was on my way to work could I come out after work,
she said if I still have it. Ok so I went off to work. My mom called the
lady and asked if her son(me) could have first choice if he gets there
this afternoon, she said if I get their by 1:00. so my mom came and took
over my shift, my boss let me go, so I drove the 45 miles to her house
to look at it. I got there at 12:55, by 1:00 I was handing over the
money.

      It has about a 2 inch tear that she sewed up, but otherwise in
excellent shape, the colors are bright, the original bags, 28 poles
which looks to be the right amount I think? It has a photo-copy of like
a parts list, I'm missing the parts that hold it to my rain gutter,
part=231 068 151(roof bracket, up to no. 2561) also 231 068 152(roof
bracket). Does anyone have any available? Or is there another way of
attaching it to my gutter? I'd love to hear any idea's you might have!
Is there a website I can look at to see how it attached to the bus? I'll
attempt to put it up as soon as it stops raining long enough. pictures
to follow. 

     I just finished installing my hubs and now have my alloy wheels on.
boy she is looking good. I'll try tomorrow to get pictures.

P.S. Thanks for listening!

Thanks,
Shawn Reed
