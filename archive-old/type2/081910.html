Subject: [T2] VW air compressor

&gt;Hey does anyone have the link to the VW air compressor conversion.  We have
&gt;been talking about one and I know I've seen the site but just can't find it
&gt;anymore.

Raymond Heath passed the info to me a month ago. VolksAir is found
at  www.angelfire_dot_com/Biz/DunnRight
The current generation uses a dual-port type 1 engine configuration,
running fuel on 2 cylinders and pumping 58scfm _at_ 100 psi into a
10 gallon tank on the other two. the trick is the cam.
Since the primary use for so much air is sandblasting, i'm  thinking
that instead of a trailer, why not mount the &quot;compressor&quot; on a &quot;sand rail &quot;
and have a mobile sandblasting service ???
