Subject: Re: [T2] push rod tubes

Chopper,


They go in before/as you put the heads on and are just a press fit between
the heads and case(with the seals on of course).  All the manuals show how
to stretch them out(carefully) before puttingthem in and torquing the
heads down.  Push rods in at the same time(loosely) helps hold them in
untill you get them rotated so the seam in the metal points to the top of
the engine and they are centered in the case and head.

You guys been doing t4 engines too long?&lt;grin&gt;...

Cheers, dave

&gt; Ken says he knows he used to do this a long time ago on our other bus back

&gt; Any ideas would be appreciated
