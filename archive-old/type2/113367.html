I've had similar woes with my 69 and a 009 and a 205T but I decided to remove 
the drive gear and attempt to set it in align with the case the way it's 
supposed to be and that was months ago. The Bus still sits in my drive way. I 
couldn't for the life of me get the drive gear toline up and the thing kept 
getting bound up tight with the brass drive on the crank and then wouldn't 
come out again with the pencil trick or a precision bent coat hangar. I'm at 
a loss too. By the way, who sells a cheap drive gear puller?
