Subject: [T2] luggage rack seal fit

&quot;I'd like to hear from Ron's opinion (after a break from his bad week of
course) on this issue since it's so common.&quot;


I don't think its a seal issue as much as a luggage rack issue. When I had
the seal on my old rack it fit great. I don't think my new rack sits as
close to the roof as the old one did. Probably needs adjusting. The trick
here is that the seal has to allow water to drain, but needs to fit tight
enough to keep the rack from vibrating.
