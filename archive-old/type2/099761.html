Subject: Kristin Laurite article in Dallas Morning News

Volks,

Today there was a large article in the Dallas Morning News about the murder of Kristin Laurite at an Arkansas rest stop on Aug. 25, 2000.  Even included a picture of her bus.  If you want more information you can go to http://www.kristinlaurite_dot_org/.  I also think you can access this article online through http://www.dallasnews_dot_com but they will make you register (free, but lots of questions) before you can see it.  It is in the &quot;Texas and SouthWest&quot; section of today's paper (Tuesday, October 15th 2002).  Many people are still actively trying to solve this case - let's not forget about it here on the list.

-David
