Subject: RE: [T2] tip

Ha! Or you can be like me and drive off and leave your locking gas cap with
my keys still in it. How you ask? My son had just been born and I was doing
the new-father-zombie-thing. The lock cylinder on my Jeep is so worn that
sometimes if the cylinder is just right, you don't need a key to start it. I
got all the way to work before I figured it out.

At least the Shell station dude was cool and held onto them for me. What is
really funny is that I did it again the next time I filled up! At the same
station with the same clerk. :) !!!

The second time was the last time I did it though. Not fun re-keying your
house locks twice in a month...

&quot;When you unlock the cap, leave the keys in it and set it on top of the
pump.  (Or put it in your pocket in a high-crime area and you have to go
inside to pay.)  Now, unless you carry two sets of keys with you, you can't
leave without replacing the cap.  Haven't had that problem ever since. &quot;
