&gt;There was nothing to graft to. the  doors as well as the dog legs got bent
&gt;up and to get  an accurate positioning I would have had to replace the
&gt;dogleg and cab floor, to replace those I would have had to repair the lower
&gt;b-pillar so I could weld to that. to repair the lower b-pillar I would have
&gt;had to replace the rocker and bulkhead sheetmetal  ,  so I could weld to
&gt;that, then I could weld the doglegs on then the new nose. All the metal 
&gt;with
&gt;the exception of the 2 front to rear beams was crushed and pushed into the
&gt;pedals and steering column.   I tried to fix it but it was way bad. a lot
&gt;worse than it looks.
