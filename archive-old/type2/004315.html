Don't know if any of you guys will get this story in the US but on the news
at the moment in the UK is the story of a Brit Bus couple touring
Austrailia.The couple were touring Aus. in an early Dormie Bay near to Alice
springs in the Northern Territories when they stopped to help some guy.The
guy then pulls a gun,ties up the girl and disappears with the guy at
gunpoint and shots are heard-the girl stuggles free and hides in the bush
for 4 hours whilst being hunted by their assailant,she managed to escape and
falg down a passing car.The Aus.police went to the scene but can't find her
boyfriend or his body-in the latest reports the police are hunting for the
boyfriend and the assailant with Aboriginal trackers but fear the worst-sad
and very scary-Martin'71 bus UK.
