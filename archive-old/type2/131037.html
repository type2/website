Subject: Re: [T2] Bad Coil and Pertronix?

I too was warned. If you mistakenly miswire it, it will melt down.
Toast. (I;m running a Pertronix unit in my 1700fi as well)

&gt; &gt; how the coil should be wired? I got a little frustrated and started
&gt; &gt; playing.
&gt;
&gt; Be careful. A friend just blew his electronic ignition by hooking the
wires
&gt; up wrong. I don't know what brand it was, but his was very sensitive to
&gt; mis-wiring, and the instructions warned as much.
