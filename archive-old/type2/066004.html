Subject: exhaust fumes in heater

I've lost the original posting, but this is in response to a question
about how to tell if the funny-smelling air coming out your VW heating
system is exhaust fumes or just that hot-engine aroma.

 Most small airports have a pilots' supply store, where you can by a
carbon-monoxide detector for about $7. It's a little plastic card (one
brand is called &quot;Dead-Stop&quot;) with a small circle of crystals that turn
dark in the presence of CO. Each card lasts about a month, and you have
to be careful to keep it out of the sun.

The only trouble is explaining it to passengers. Most folks don't want
to hear that you're worried that your car is poisoning anyone who rides
in it.
