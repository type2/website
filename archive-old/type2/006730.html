Was in Lowe's yesterday and purchased some foiled insulation much
like the kind that JC Whitney sells.  This had aluminum foil front,
padding, and aluminum foil back.  They sell it in 4x25 foot rolls
for $44 (100 sq ft as compared to 24 sq ft in Whitney for $22).  They
also have it in 2x25 foot rolls, and 16&quot;x25' rolls at cheaper prices
of course.  Just thought those who are insulating might be interested.
