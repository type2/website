Subject: Low compression Q?

Just had a compression check done.  Results were 130, 40, 118, 130
(1-4).  Cylinder #2 is way low.  It was measured at 100 psi over a year
ago.  What do I risk by not fixing that cylinder now?  I'm moving to CO
at the end of the month and hate to have work done in Alabama before I
move.  Also, I plan to buy a Mark Stephens engine in the near future?
Is there anything the FLAPS can do, inexpensively, that I should have
done?  Or should I just put the engine back in the bus and forget about
it until after I move?
