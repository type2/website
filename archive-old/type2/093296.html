Subject: Re: [T2] Question #3 Starting and resin


&gt;O.K. were getting close to a great running bus I just have two more 
&gt;questions. :) First one is quite often when I try to start it everything 
&gt;looks fine, oil and alt lights come on then when I turn the key to pos 3 
&gt;it clicks and everything goes dead. No radio...alt or oil pressure 
&gt;lights...nothing. I go to the back and give the main battery wire a little 
&gt;tug, go back and everything fires right up. Do you think it's just a 
&gt;battery connection or something else I don't know about?

You need to remove the battery, remove the cables and clean everything with 
a wirebrush. Then reassemble. Coat everything with the red colored sealant 
available in a spray can at the FLAPS or coat with vaseline or grease to 
seal the corrosion out. You need to do this from time to time. Also clean 
the places where the cables fasten to the VW. I was the in charge of the 
batteries on my ship when I was in the Navy.

&gt;#2 When I got the van there was an exhaust leak that pretty much was 
&gt;pumping the exhaust into the engine intake. Everything was like a well 
&gt;used pipe in there...lots of sticky oil (if only it was the right kind) 
&gt;Filters been changed (was absolutly horrible) and I cleaned what I could 
&gt;get from throttle body but there is some sort of air flow sensor right 
&gt;after the air box. What is the best way to clean this without damaging it? 
&gt;What would it make my engine do if it was covered with crap?

You can power wash the engine if it is not scalding hot. If you dump cold 
water on a hot engine you risk cracking it. Expect starting troubles if you 
get the ignition really wet.

I would recommend you pull the engine, strip off the tin and power 
wash/clean everything. I'll bet the fins are covered in junk and grease 
that will leave your engine running hot or create hot spots.

Reassemble everything replacing any missing seals or tin. I usually paint 
the tin piece by piece during this cleaning and I always replace all of the 
fuel lines.

Reinstall. Your total cost will probably be less than $50 and your bus will 
be much better for it.
