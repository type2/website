Subject: Black wire coming from driver's side firewall 72 Westy 1700cc

Hey Folks,

I'm finally getting around to putting the motor back in my 72 westy
(1700cc) and in doing so I have found a black wire coming from the
driver's side of firewall with a 10 amp fuse and I do not know what it
is for.

Any ideas?

I am not sure if this is one that was connected or not when I took out
the engine.  I did not mark it so maybe it was not connected?


Any help would be appreciated.

Craig
