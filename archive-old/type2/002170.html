Hello,

What is/are the advantage(s) if any  of using a 050 distributor versus an
009 distributor on a type IV engine? I see by the archives (thanks) that
there are many a 009 in the type IVs. I just purchased an 050 and am
wondering why I did, except that the vendors recommend that I do! (No vacuum
advance distributors, not until I can afford a stock vacuum pulse!)


Thanks

Rich Patano
