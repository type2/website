Subject: Re:  tight intake valve

Nikki:

Like how tight?  If it was really tight and required a lot of adjustment to
bring it back into spec, I'd keep a close eye on it, maybe check it again
in another thousand miles.  Did you adjust the valves yourself the last
time they were adjusted?  If so, you will have a good feel for how well
they were adjusted the last time.

I feel a story coming on...

My ex-mother in law took her '76 van to the dealer a few years back to have
the valves adjusted among other things.  When she got it back, it leaked
oil profusely (they forgot to install the valve cover gaskets).  While I
was under there, dirty and aggravated with the valve covers off, I thought
I'd check the valve settings.  Some were set properly, some were not.  Now
this was straight from the dealer with less than 10 miles on the adjustment
so I knew that it was just sloppy valve adjustment and obvious lack of
attention to detail (like gaskets).

I guess my long winded point is that if your valve was waaaay tight, and
you KNOW that it was adjusted properly the last time, it could be the
beginnings of a dropped valve seat or other valve damage.  Monitor closely.
If it was just a little tight, it could be just normal wear and tear.
