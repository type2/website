For all of you DIY EFI people, this is BIG news.  Most WBO2 sensors have 
no published data on the workings of these sensors, and now Bruce and Al 
(designers of the Megasquirt) have broken the silence and made this 
information public.

If you don't know what a wide-band O2 sensor is, it's like your normal 
O2 sensor, but it can tell you exactly what fuel ratio is (NB sensor 
only tells rich/lean).  The coolest part about the controller that Bruce 
and Al have designed is that it is DIY, open source with an excellent 
support group, and will probably be alot cheaper than commercial products.

For more info and lots of reading, check this out:

http://www.megasquirt2_dot_com/PWC/

They will be releasing the controller both separately and also as part 
of the UMS (ultra megasquirt).  The completed UMS setup won't be out for 
another few months, but once it's released, it'll be one of the most 
cost-effect methods to get your bus in the best tune it can be by 
allowing full control of EFI &amp; electronic ignition!!  Very, very hot stuff!

later,
Mike
