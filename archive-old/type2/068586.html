&gt;Latest Rage (uh, did I say SoCal?) offers a Bench Mount for $18.00 and a
&gt;'floor' model (which tears down for storage) for $40.00.  No catalog no.s.
&gt;Fax order no. is 310-404-5001, phone order no. is 310-404-5001
&gt;
&gt;Rocky Mountain Motor works also offers a bench mount (part no. 30290) for
&gt;$24.95 and a floor model (which tears down, part no. 30288) for $69.95.
&gt;Toll free order no. is 1-800-258-1996

I have a nice strong watercooled engine stand that will hold and rotate a
V-8 that I got cash &amp; carry at the local discount tool supply for $45.00,
not on sale. I've never tried to hang a VW engine from it but I don't see
why it wouldn't do. Look locally.

(If you have a bench, then why do you need a stand for a VW engine? I still
don't understand this. Is it a Type IV thing?)
