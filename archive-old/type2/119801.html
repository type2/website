Subject: Total Newbie: Questions!

Hi Gang,

I used to have many years ago a 1966 bettle, and now
have my eye on a pretty well restored 1968 Bus, the
camper model, I think a Riviera because 3/4th of the
whole top comes up parallel instead of slanted??

Anyway, I don't know much about buses; it seems to
have the 1600 single port motor.

I am looking for this to be my daily driver, and
hopefully hold 65-70 MPH in most cases: What can I
expect?

I've been told I can get 50-75 thousand miles from the
motor; true?

Any trouble areas I should pay attention too?

Thanks for the help in advance!

Warren
