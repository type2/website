Subject: Bringing the Good Old Van home

Well, we got the word today that the work on the '81 Westy is done.
The dealer in Harrisburg put in the salvage flex plate we sent, replaced
the rear engine seal (probably damaged when the old flex plate literally
blew apart on the PA Turnpike0. Also replaced the throtle cable. I'm
sure that it broke when they dropped the tranny. Anyway we're going to
pick her up this weekend. Sure wish it hadn't happened 300 miles from
home in Cleveland.

So we plan on dropping the engine and checking things out after
we get it home.

1) Put a dial indicator on the crank and make sure that the end is
   true.

2) Get some inspection dye and checking the flex plate for stress cracks.

3) Replacing the torque converter

We're almost positive that the torque converter is out of balance.
The engine seems to run as smooth as silk. It is newly rebuilt (3,000 miles)
from AVP, who seem to have a good reputation. Anyone out there have any
thoughts on this?

Lisa
