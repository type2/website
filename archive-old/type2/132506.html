Subject: Re: [T2] VW's take on tires - Owner's manual and Bently specify
  these  tires.

I have a 76 High Top Westy converted by a PO to a Weber progressive. As 
I was sorting out some parts in preparation for a trip, I discovered 
two double relays in a box of spare parts from the same PO. I would 
like to wire one of these so that the electric fuel pump automatically 
turns off when the engine turns off. I'd appreciate advice, not 
judgement (no, I wouldn't have gotten rid of the FI if it had been my 
choice).
