Subject: Westfalia parts needed

Hey folks...

I'm looking for a couple of small Westy parts for a late bay, and am 
hoping someone out there can hook me up:

	* 2 curtain tie-backs in black (for the rear hatch).  One of mine
	  is broken, the other is about ready to break.  I have only been
	  able to find new ones in the brown color (at busdepot).  All of
	  my other tie-backs are in good shape, which is why I hesitate to
	  replace them all with the brown.

	* 2 rubber bumpers, the kind used for the folding upper bunk and
	  to hold the table top in place in the rear cargo area.  These are
	  going to be used on my camping stool pseudo-replica.

Willing to pay a fair price + shipping, of course.

Thanks!
