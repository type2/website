Subject: Re: [T2] Front Turn Indicator City Lights

&gt; OK, I replaced the small 4 watt bulb in my front turn indicator assembly  ('78 Westy)
But both bulbs (4 W &amp; light/turn) come on in each assembly when I turn the
 parking and when I turn the driving lights on.
I want the small, 4 watt bulb to come on when I turn my ignition on, and the
 other bulb to come on when the lights are turned to park or driving.
Anybody have the answer??  If so, please RSVP.

Sorry, it is working the way it was designed.....as a side marker light!

With the little bulb wired in parallel to the parking light, you cannot put ignition-on voltage to it. You
would need to separate the grey wires at the light assembly and run the wire that goes to the little bulb to a
hot-with-ignition-on fuse.
