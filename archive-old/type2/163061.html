Subject: Re: Followup on burning oil

The new #3 P&amp;C is having fun doing 1/4 of the work pushing my bus
forward. Pray for the piston pin clips. It is being refreshed by the
usual Rite Aid best oil. Unfortunately it looks like driving with all
this grit in the oil did hurt the bearings, oil light now comes on at
very low idle. It used to never want to turn on. I will run the
numbers one of these days. For the first time, the thermostat seems to
be working fine.
