Your best bet is go to someone in town that sews(Mother,Mother in law,
someone else's mother, a seamstress) before you go to a mail-order business.
After you find someone to sew it for you go to a fabric store and pick out
the material that you want.  Measure your window openings or your scraps of
left over curtains and then have your seamstress of choice make them for
you.  Even if you were to call a high school in the area I bet that they
would be happy to sew them for you as it is a simple straight forward sewing
assignment.  Not to take away from our mail order business but for Pete
sakes it is just curtains!!!
