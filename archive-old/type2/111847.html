Subject: Re: [T2] looking for T2-microfiches

&gt; The newer ones are on CD rom. The program is called
&gt; ETKA.

Yes I know the ETKA. I also have it but so many parts
are mentioned as 'Nicht mehr lieverbar' / 'No longer
available'...after I click on them. Actually I am not
interested to see if they are still available. I want
to know the extra info that comes with certain parts:

- when were they used on buses?
- what M-code are they part of?
- for which export markets available?
- what variations are available of certain parts? (for
example: different interior colors)

So I am looking for fiches that were issued in the
years that the T2 was still in production or a few
years after the production stopped (early 80ties).
