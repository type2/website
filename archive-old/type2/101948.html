Subject: Re: [T2] FI fuel pump failing?

Here is my thought. Before you go and swap the fuel
pump, try removing the gas cap and then take readings.
This could show that your fuel tank is not vent
properly causeing the erratic readings. You could also
plug off the vacuum nipple on the fuel regulator and
see if this makes a difference. This is just
speculation but it would be easy to test. Could a
leaky cold start valve or injectors cause these
readings? Those are the only oter things that I could
think of. I assume you don't have fuel leaks. Good
luck. I hope it is somthing cheep and easy to fix! :)

Have a great day!

&gt; I'm sorry the wording was not very clean on some
&gt; points, let me 
&gt; clarify.  I changed the fuel filter today with a
&gt; fresh one, same 
&gt; erratic readings from the gauge. I was hoping it was
&gt; a clogged 
&gt; fuel filter but ...I have tested the fuel pump with
the engine off
&gt; by deflected the 
&gt; AFM flap with the ignition ON and the pump doesn't
&gt; make strange noises 
&gt; as frequently?!? 
&gt; Tomorrow I'll check the fuel quantity delivered by
&gt; the pump and
&gt; make sure that the tank outlet line is also not
&gt; partially clogged.
&gt; 
&gt; Any more thoughts?
