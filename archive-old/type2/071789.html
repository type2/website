&lt;&lt; Should it seem
this sloppy? I'm aware that the shifter is about 3 times longer than what I'm 
used to, so any
sloppiness would be magnified, but this seems really out there.  &gt;&gt;

Check the archives for adjusting the shift lever at the floor...This 
&quot;sloppiness&quot;
may just be the result of worn or maladjusted parts at that end; not the 
trans.
