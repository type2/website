Subject: roof skirt on '71 Dormobile
Date: Wed, 25 Nov 1998 15:29:56 -0800
Message-ID: &lt;000001be18cb$edf5f6e0$1cc522c3_at_brennanf&gt;

Importance: Normal

can anyone help.....the roof skirt on my '71 Dormobile has parted where it
was once joined ( presumably joined by heat ) and I would like to rejoin it.
Is there a suitable glue with which to do this....or can I rejoin it using
heat, and if so how? The roof is the original and is relatively good
condition other than the seams.
Thanks Garp
'71 Dormobile &quot; Dingbat&quot;
