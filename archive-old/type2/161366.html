&gt;it's from a BMW website, but it's essentially the same

&gt;to the Bartnik writeup on the type2 website.

Check the list of L-Jet links on my homepage as well.

&gt;Also, I have an easy way to test whether the fuel pump
&gt;works. Instead of taking the air filter out and that
&gt;whole headache, just take the cover off the top of the
&gt;AFM and gently move the wiper so the switch closes.

Most AFMs, especially new or rebuilt have sealed covers so it would be easier to remove the air cleaner than crack the cover open.

&gt;Does anyone else do this? It seems safe since you're
&gt;just moving what the air would move...

Even easier than what you suggest would be to short pins 36 and 39 in the AFM connector of the FI harness.
