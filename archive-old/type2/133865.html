Subject: Re: [T2] headlight flicker

Hiya Ben,

I presume that both low beams are flickering, not just one?  If so, it is 
most likely that you are having problems with your headlight (high beam/low beam) 
relay.  You'll find it atop your fuse box.  Check your connections to the 
relay and make sure they are secure.  If so, you are likely looking at replacing 
that relay.
