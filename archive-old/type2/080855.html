All I know is I am really getting excited about this. I learned a lot at
Everybus when Steve worked on my bus.

Does someone have a good video camera?

I'll take pics anyway.

&gt; Sounds like a good idea.  I'd try to have several
&gt; dizzies, carbs, cases, etc.  Surely there are a
&gt; few around.  If not, we could supplement with a
&gt; photo if necessary.
