Subject: RE: [T2] VDO Oil Temp Sender

I was just about to post a related question ... A guy at a local VW shop
suggested to mount the sender in the &quot;unused&quot; sump plate (held by two hex
screws, next to the oil filler tube). What is the general list wisdom on
mounting the oil temp sender in this location?

Subject: VDO Oil Temp Sender

So, which is the correct sender for installing in the sump plate? I see both
VDO 323-888 and 323-055 listed at various vendors. Both Bus-Boys and
BusDepot list 323-888, so I'm more inclined to believe them. How does this
install? I know the plate has to be drilled 9/16. Do I have to located a
properly threaded nut to install it on the plate? Does the sender come with
instructions for installing on the plate?
