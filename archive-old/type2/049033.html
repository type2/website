Subject: [T2] Westy owner's book?

I found a link a while back to an early-bay-westy owner's book (maybe 72?).
It was a complete set of scanned pages.  I thought I found it at type2_dot_com,
but I don't see it there now.  Anyone know where it is?  I searched the
archives too, no luck.  It was in a section on a website that contained lots
of publications.

Anyone have the same book for 1968?  I'd love a set of YOM books for my
glove box, but copies would be fine too.
