Greetings---
      Saw a 'moving sale' sign in front of an old upholstery shop recently.
On a whim, I stopped.  The place was practically empty, just a few chairs and
piles of foam rubber, etc.  There was a stack of all sorts of bolts of remnant
vinyl and naugahyde headed for the dumpster, which I reluctantly started to
paw through.  Saw that unmistakeable sickly green leering from under mounds of
crazy '70's colors.  To make a long story longer, I wound up with about two
yards of it for $5, which, along with the plaid upper bunk cushion cover I got
from Ron should be enough to do my front seats with some left over.  
     FWIW, this stuff is marked on the back thusly:  Naujolex (the &quot;j&quot; is
shaped like an anchor), BP-77-18.   It's slightly thicker and the grain is
smoother, but the color is spot on, as close as you can get.  I know nothing
of this company, or vinyl sources in general, but I bet someone in Listland
does.  Anyway, it's a possible lead.  I know that I just got lucky, but
there's old shops out there by the gazillion, so it's always worth an impulse
stop if you see one.  I would be glad to hack off little squares of this and
the original stuff for samples if anybody needs/wants one.

Merry Christmas, Matt Q. '77 Westfalia
