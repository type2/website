Subject: Re: [T2] Sound Deadening Info and Heater Blower Hoses



Wow!  Yep, mcmaster-carr has it!

They have some serious hoses in there including some that
can handle up to 500 degrees farenheit!

Unfortunately, most of the really nice stuff comes in 3&quot; and up
sizes.  Might be ok for the run from front to back though.

Here is where I quit:

 Construction: Orange-red, 2-ply fiberglass fabric with silicone coating
 Reinforcement: Spring-steel wire helix and a fiberglass cord bonded to=20
cover
 Temperature Range:
  -75=B0 to +500=B0 F

It will handle working pressure starting at 28psi and 3/4&quot; sizes.

Others follow, this was on page 170.

Cheers ,dave
