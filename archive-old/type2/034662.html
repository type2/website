+AD4APg- Inside was a piece of newspaper.  It was I imagine getting sucked over
the
+AD4APg- outlet and blocking it off but floating free after a while.

+AD4-What I want to know is why you put newspapers in your fuel???    seriously
+AD4-how the heck did that get in there?????

OK,  OK  it's pretty dumb I know, but I did a spray job and stuffed a piece
of paper in the filler whilst I was sanding round it. I guess a bit got torn
off and left behind.
