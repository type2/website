European specification VW Vanagon, with twin Solex Carburettors, had shorter 
inlet manifolds, than the 1972~79 VW Type 2.

I have some spare if anyone is interested!

Regards.

&gt; &gt; I am new to this list and I'm glad I found it.
&gt;
&gt;welcome
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I own a 1982 vanagon that has lost it's engine. I need to know if a 1973
&gt;
&gt;want us to help you look for it..... (bad bad bad, couldn't resist)
&gt;
&gt; &gt; camper/bus westfalia 2.0L engine will fit my vanagon. . I can get the 
&gt;engine
&gt; &gt; for $500 and it has been recently rebuilt.
&gt;
&gt;first off a 73 engine would not be a 2liter engine but only 1.7 liter.  it
&gt;also would not be fuel injected but dual carbs.
&gt;
&gt;it will fit however, sort of...would need a lot of parts from your
&gt;vanagon, not sure the carb accelerator linkage would fit...it would take
&gt;some cobbling to get things working, and then it would be even more
&gt;underpowered than it used to be.
&gt;
&gt;also what kind of shape is the 73 engine in???  it could be a pile of
&gt;trouble waiting to drive you nuts too!!
&gt;
&gt;now I used a 1.7 in my van as a &quot;keep it running&quot; while I rebuilt my 2
&gt;liter engine right.  but my bus is my only set of wheels.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; My husband is a truck driver and has no time to work on it so I am going 
&gt;to,
&gt; &gt; as I have been waiting 18 mos for him to get at it. I love my van and 
&gt;want
&gt; &gt; it running again.
&gt;
&gt;get the appropriate manuals for you  van, I would start with the Bentley
&gt;(or official) manual.  good luck
&gt;
&gt;Bob
