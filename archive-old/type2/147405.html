Subject: Re: [T2] How I used rubber bands to make my bus go faster

So... I was unaware that a spring exists.  I do know that when I adjust 
the cable, I pull as hard as I can on the rod at the end of it before I 
tighten the clamp.  Is this the same as strapping the pedal to the dash 
for purposes of adjusting?

 &gt;furthermore the accelerator pedal would not return to its full height.
