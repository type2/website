Subject: Re: [T2] Re-calibrating AFM?

I'm not one of those people who say not to mess with it.

First, I'd try one more time to find any vacuum leaks.  I think a better
method than spraying flammable stuff around a running engine is to
pressurize the system and check for leaks with lots of soapy water.  (Gets
your engine cleaner, too!)  First, pull off all the large hoses and inspect
them by eye and by air pressure.  (Expect to come out with a dirty mouth.)
Then, put the hoses back on and connect a compressor to the hose leading to
the aux air regulator - plug the resulting hole in the S-tube with a cork -
fire up the compressor and start spraying and swabbing every hose and
connection.  (I typically block off the exhaust pipe and the throttle valve
too, but that may be over kill.)

One common source of air leaks on these things is the fabric-covered hose on
the decel valve that the clear hose from the air distribution box connects
to.

If you really can't find someone around you that can hook up an exhaust gas
analyzer (not even a VW dealer??) then using the O2 sensor as described by
Probst works well.

&gt; Hi All:
&gt;
&gt; I'm aware of the implications of adjusting the spring tension on the
&gt; AFM, and that everyone says not to mess with it.   [snip]
&gt;
&gt; [snip] I've tried to
&gt; check for vacuum leaks various ways (spraying water, carb cleaner and
&gt; acetylene, hooking up a vacuum gauge and disconnecting one vacuum hose
&gt; at a time and plugging the inlet. etc) and can't find any vacuum leaks.
[snip]
&gt; The only anomaly that I can
&gt; find is that the vacuum reading at the plenum ( the tap for the fuel
&gt; pressure regulator) is running around 11 inches Hg.  I've been told
&gt; that this should be around 15 to 18 inches Hg, but as I mentioned
&gt; earlier, I can find no vacuum leak.  [snip]

&gt; Since we don't have emissions testing here in Indiana, I have not been
&gt; able to find a shop with an exhaust gas analyzer that is willing to
&gt; work with me.  Probst gives some information about calibrating the AFM
&gt; using the output of the oxygen sensor.  (I have a stock Cal emissions
&gt; bus).  I thought I might try that re-calibration before I spring for a
&gt; rebuilt AFM.
