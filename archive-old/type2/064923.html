&gt;One thing I wonder about is can people actually realize any appraised
&gt;value?

&gt;My take on ratings: My van with 50,000 miles, and all original parts
&gt;including original tires, and ZERO rust, no rustoration was a catagory 3.
&gt;The engine fire has reduced it to a catagory 4, but with some cleanup, and
&gt;replacing _all_ damaged parts, I could get it back to a 3. Comments?

Guys. Guys. Reality check, okay?

You have got to stop thinking about these things as if they are financial
investments. If you can justify it as a driver, fine, but listen:

These are VW Busses. These trucks are synonymous in American English with
&quot;anachronism&quot;. If they were musical instruments they would be banjos
(played by Appalachian _idiot savants_). Alright? These are cargo vans so
impotent that they cannot go up hills even without cargo. They aren't
capable of highway speeds. They provoke kidney ailments in older people.
Every damn one of us lives in constant fear of a(nother) catastrophic
breakdown. A side wind could well get you killed...

Show me another car that is expected to appreciate, that was never
manufactured *without* rubber floor mats. Show me another car whose
aesthetics are referred to (by its devotees, not its detractors) as a loaf
of bread.

I love them, I really do. There is something euphoric about driving one
with my elbow out, the wind fouling my left ear, bus trailing behind me. I
think it is the finest thing to drive I have ever found.

But it has no flash at all. It was deliberately marketed as flashless by VW
(which organization at one time knew how to sell cars). Cars that
appreciate *always* have flash. Show me an exception.

When you subtract the copious maintenance costs (yes, including your time)
you are not going to be able to make significant money on a VW Bus. I'm
sorry, and I don't mean to flame Bill Crick, but you're just not. It's an
excellent workhorse if you're willing to maintain it, but this #2 - #3
stuff strikes me as daffy. We ain't pageant material, and we're never gonna
be, so stop all this hairspray and primping and high heels. Sheez. ;)
