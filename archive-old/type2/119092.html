Subject: Re: [T2] CV Bolts

 Fortunately  I ordered a complete set of CV Bolts (24) a month ago from Bus
Depot to replace some that were stripping.  These however did not come with
washers.  Can washers be found at Lowes or Home Depot that will serve the
purpose?  If so what should I look for.

FYI The new bolts are the 8? MM allen bolts and not the special CV bolt head
that I bought the special tool for..

Thanks,
Snoopy
