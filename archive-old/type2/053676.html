Subject: Am I Insane?

So it's down to the wire here, volks.  I leave for a cross continent round
trip of ~8,000 miles next Tuesday morning at 7:30am (heads up for any AIRS
members between Berkeley, CA and Maine).  Last night I finally got the
engine back in old Frances ('76 Westy 2.0L FI).  This is an AVP rebuild with
lots of new parts on top of it.

First question:  Do I stand a chance of actually completing this trip, or am
I dreaming?

Second question:  Distributors scare me.  I have an inordinate fear of
having this set wrong and blowing up my engine.  How do I set the
distributor timing before starting the engine?  Will I need a timing gun?
Will I need a timing gun with advance?  I've set the distributor so that at
TDC for #1 the rotor is pointing at that little slot in the distributor.
But from the pictures I took when disassembling the engine it seems that the
distributor is now rotated CCW about 10 degrees from what it was before when
those marks lined up.  What's the deal?  How should I set the dizzy before
turning over the engine?

Third question:  I made the mistake of taking my labels off the injector
wires after I installed them and then removed them again.  Now I'm not sure
if I have the right wires on the right injectors.  Is this bad?  How do I
make it right?

Four:  What things can I do to ease my paranoia before I turn the engine on
for the first time?

TIA,
Niall
