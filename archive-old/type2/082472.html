Subject: Selling 72 Westie

Hi All,

We are finally selling our much loved 1972 Butterscotch colored Westie.  She
has been a wonderful vehicle but advancing age (ours, not hers) requires that
we find a camper with more room and comfort (probably a mid 80-s vanagan
westie).  Her name is Lily and we want to find a good home for her.

We don't really know what we should be asking for her, so we thought the list
might be able to give us some ideas.

She is currently running great and is ready to roll.

BTW, her name is Lily (and, we live near Tacoma, WA).

Here are the facts about Lily:

Details:  
**1972, bed downstairs/cot upstairs 
**ice box (no fridge or stove in '72) 
**very strong 2.0 engine was professionally rebuilt by OVALS in Federal Way, WA
(12,000 miles on rebuilt engine); engine uses very little oil--usually no need
to add oil between oil changes)
**12,000 miles ago:  
new clutch, pressure plate, and throw out bearing; 
new front brake rotors and calipers; 
new rear brakes, slave cylinder, and break shoes; 
new brake master cylinder and brake lines (rubber); 
new throttle, heater, and clutch cables; 
new exhaust system; 
new pot top seal
**dual carbs (recently worked on, newly calibrated and adjusted)
**interior mostly original (except for the curtains--though we do have the
orginal curtain that wraps around the front windows) and in good shape and very
clean, 
**Butterscotch color paint looks good with minor rust, **decent bumpers
**decent canvas on the pop-top
**great stereo (4 speakers/cd player)
**mosquito net
**2 vw manuals (including excellent shop manual) sink/pump work perfectly
**missing sun visor on passenger's side
**new 8 ply tires
**runs great, ready to go!!

Plus, of course, she also has a HUGE heart and spirit and is VERY beautiful.

Thanks,

Dale and Trish
(P.S., I would be happy to send pictures if anyone is interested in seeing
Lily)
