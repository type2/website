Subject: Cleaning 1/2 torn down engine

Well i got my engine on the stand/down to the shop &amp; torn down to the
basics. any suggestions on how to clean the block? I am not taking it so
far down as to split the case. with my other rebuilds ( of the american
v8 type engine) i pressure washed it &amp; let it dry real good. nice since
it has an oil pan. now with this 2 liter type-4 engine i don't have
that. Should I just pull the heads &amp; pressure wash it &amp; allow for ample
dry time or what? 

BTW I expect much better cooling now that I can clean up the oil cooler
instead of it being a solid block of hard oil. tia.
