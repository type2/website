Subject: A.A. Best Co...heard of them?

Has anyone heard of this company...A.A. Best Co. from central PA?  He is 
selling replacement pop-top canvases on e*ay, but doesn't have any 
pictures.  I emailed him asking for pictures (since I'm in the market for a 
new canvas) and he referred me to the company web site.

At this link is an &quot;actual picture of one of our tops on the front of a 
magazine.&quot;  I typically don't like to second guess people, but it look 
awfully similar to the GoWesty opening web page picture (minus the palm 
tree of course.)

http://www.gowesty_dot_com/

Just wondering if anyone on the list has done business with this 
company.  My old canvas from the '75 is shredded and I'll need a new one by 
spring.  To be honest, the main reason I'm still shopping for one, is that 
I kind of wanted a grey colored one.  PLFVW has them, but they cost 
considerably more.

I don't know...does anyone have a photo of their TAN colored canvas?  My 78 
had a yellowish one...kind of yucky.  Maybe a tan one wouldn't be so bad, 
and then I could order from someone reputable.

Anyway, any info on the company OR a photo of your TAN canvas would be 
greatly appreciated!

TIA

Missy:)



&gt;  Hello Melissa,
&gt;   &lt;http://mall.1usa_dot_com/aabestco/merchant.ihtml?id=221&amp;step=2&gt;This is the 
&gt; best that I can do right now. It is an actual picture of one of our tops 
&gt; on the front of a magazine. I will refund your shipping if you send me 
&gt; some usable digital photos, if you buy one.
&gt;                             Regards, Karl
&gt;
