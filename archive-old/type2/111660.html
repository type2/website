Hi folks...

I had to track down a vac leak on my '76 Westy this evening, and now that
I've found and fixed it, my curiosity is getting the better of me; I'm not
sure what it is the faulty vac hose was going to.

It was a part on the left side of the engine compartment, fastened to the
sheet metal.  It was roughly the shape of the vacuum assembly that is on
the distributor, but larger.  It had some wires coming out of it, so
presumably it is some sort of vacuum-actuated switch/pot.  The part number
I could make out while shining a flashlight on it is 022 906 281.  Hopefully
that's correct -- it was getting dark outside :-)

I'm guessing it's either emissions-related, or fuel-supply-related, but
that's just a WAG.

Apologies for my ignorance, but I'm still getting familiar with the
Type 4 engine.

Thanks!
