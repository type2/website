Subject: Re: Hot Running 73 Westy

One thing I'd intended to try on the Vanagon but didn't was replacing
the distributor, which had a fair amount of wiggle to it.  I'd read
a couple of different places that this can make a difference, and
who am I to argue?  

Something that did help a little was running 5-W-50 oil in it.   I'd 
guess 20-W-50 might get you similar results.  10-W-30 gets a
little thin in the summer.  

For what it's worth, I'm not convinced that the Muir dipstick test is
valid on the pancake engine--I know on the Vanagon &amp; on the '79
they could really be quite hot &amp; I could touch the dipstick &amp; hold
it easily.  I think that's applicable more to the upright engines.
