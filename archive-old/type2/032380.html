Fellow VW folks!
I want to thank you all for the response that I got regarding the Spring 2001
Cincinnati Bus event I am trying to pull together.  There was so much good
feedback and excitement from the people who contacted me that I just couldn\'t
wait to get started on the arrangements.  So I am happy to say that it looks
like this thing is going to happen!!  Ted Finesman is in the process of re-activating a local club called Tri-State Transporters as a sponsor.  I have set up a web site at
www.geocities_dot_com/buses_n_boats  with all the details.  So check this site out
and be sure to contact me with any other ideas, suggestions, questions, or
helpful hints.  And please add a link to this site on any personal VW sites
which you may have and bring it up in chat rooms, web rings, etc., etc., etc.!
 I am very excited about this event and am confident that we can turn it into
a huge gathering!!  If for some reason you can\'t access the aforementioned
web site, email me and I can get you the details directly!
Peace All!!
John Baker
