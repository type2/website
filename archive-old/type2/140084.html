all the wiring and vacuum is on tight. overnight battery charge on a 20
month old battery brought it up to 11.5 amps.

gerald:11.5 VOLTS -- sounds like the fire:

a) toasted your battery
b) toasted your charging circuit (or wiring in the vicinity)

The fuel sender is a hint.

Break out the Bentley diagram and start checking for voltage where voltage
should be.

You'll probably have to replace most wires that are over/near the engine.
Heat damage to wiring is not always visually apparent.

If the battery reached 250 degrees or so it probably had a plate come loose
inside. Replace it.

thanks for that advice. i changed the regulator.  the sender departed a few
thousand miles before the fire. along with the regulator, i put in used
wires this morning, used switch and wires to the fan. i was hoping to get
away with the original wires because it was such a small, small fire. with
that i doubt the battery saw 250 heat. it was like a birthday cake fire in
there.

i guess it goes with saying that trying to fix with used parts is a drag
and not very scientific. i'm scrounging these buses along. that said, i
think it should be flooded with all the starting and turning over going on
[with the jump starts by other cars]. what i can't gather is why it doesn't
smell like gas. at the breakdown site last summer i changed filter and pump
with known good spares, and have not driven it since. perhaps i'm up
against the dreaded FI components. dual carbs?
