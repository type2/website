&gt; 1915DP.
&gt; 
&gt; I installed a dual Oil Pressure (one terminal for PSI and one for the Oil
&gt; Idiot light) sender. Haven't wired the PSI side to a gauge yet, but the
&gt; Idiot light is wired.
&gt; 
&gt; When warm, the idiot light comes on solid at anything less than 1200rpm. I
&gt; think the new sender need adjusting, because the old sender didn't do that.
&gt; 
&gt; What's the prescribed method for this?

this is a common occurrence. the VDO sender is different than the stock oil
pressure switch.

the VDO sender will light the idiot light at anything below 11 psi. the
stock sender lights the light from 3-6 psi.

put the gauge on and you will see for sure what is going on. i don't know
about calibrating the VDO sender.
