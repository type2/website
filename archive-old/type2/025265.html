Subject: Why wont the engine start
Message-ID: &lt;B40201A62C09D111B34400805F0DB0867A0BE3_at_pdx01-msx-02.ikon_dot_org&gt;

So here I am trying to get my new incredibly clean 78 ASI to fire up. This
bus has been parked for a few years. The past owner had said that it was
parked because of low compression, but later said it might fire up and run
just fine. I wanted to get it running before I do any diagnostics but cant
get it to kick. 

The steps I have done so far-

Checked for fuel running throughout the FI lines - its there

I replaced the points and condenser, points had a big spike on them

Verified the distributor is in correctly and timed at 8 BTDC

Checked spark at plugs, a little weak

Replaced the coil with my spare blue coil

Tried using Starting Fluid with no results

At this point the engine sounds normal as it turns over. It cranks for a
15-30 seconds before I hear 1 cylinder begin to fire on each stroke. That's
it. 

I assume that the problem is still in the ignition system because the Ether
should at least give it a bang. Tomorrow I am going to replace all of the
plugs and the cap and rotor. 

Any other suggestions?
