Subject: Busses and the VW fairy
Date: Sat, 28 Nov 1998 01:11:38 PST

Hey Y'all,
  If you have been to the web page that talks about the VW fairy them 
you will know what is happening here. Today I sold the 74 Bug that I had 
sitting around to a friend in Oregon. While sitting in front of my house 
with the Bug attached to the Van he was towing it with, the Managers 
son-in-law came out to talk to me. I sold him a Dodge Apsen a few months 
back and it seens that the reason he bought it was that his VW Bus had 
quit due to some electrical problem. So he knew that I was interested in 
VW's and offered to sell me his 73 Bus. I didn't even have the one VW 
out of my yard and I'm looking into another (am I crazy?). The VW fairy 
is up to her games again. The Bus is a 2.0 with an auto trans and a 
sunroof. I don't need it but am temped to go get it anyway. 
  So, if I do get it and can not get the electrical problem fixed, I 
will be parting it out. Is there anyone interested in the 2.0l or the 
auto trans? I have not seen it or made an offer on it yet, so I don't 
know what carbs it has or if its an F.I. engine. I will do a compression 
test on it and try to at least get it to run even if the buss wont 
drive.
  Please let me know if there is any interest in this. I will not be 
into the Bus for a lot of money so I can let the parts go at a good 
price and still get the stuff I want. And NO the sunroof does not work, 
cables are broken.
