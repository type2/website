Subject: [T2]76 shiftrod stop plate adjustment ((no end to a
  solution)).........

thanks everyone.... this has became a real issue and i have lost what sanity i had left on this simple little part known as a stop plate and its correct adjustment.... 

the plate is just well i want say it here but it is what it is.... 
&amp;^%*^^%*%^%(*&amp;^ 
 

i ended up jerry rigging it to barely have third and fourth just so i can get to work and back .... 
and still have no reverse.....  

i dont like it at all and by the bentley it says to put the stop plate in one way but i think its wrong....???? just by what i have found......??? and by other bus's i have loosened and looked at..... 

i took the stop plate off buddahs old bus and it was on the way i thought it should go which is opposite of the bentley schematic.... 

the notch at the bottom of the plate goes to bottom left but i had to rig it where it is turned around other way just to find third and fourth and let me tell you .... 
i have moved that little plate all around to just barely enough to get the gears i have.... 

With all the write ups on how to do this and that.. 
where is the good stuff on how to do this adjustment correctly besides what the bentley suggest .. which isnt much.... 

it is a very delicate thing i tell you that and with everything else we got on us at home right now... its tried my every nerve to be broke down over something so stupid.... 

as much as it gets my hide i rest and get back out there again time and time again to get it right with little to no successs... 

i cant find anyone with the answer to this problem....??///&gt;&gt;&gt;??? 

100% it is in the adjustment of the stop plate ..... 

yes my rear coupler is in bad shape but the problem is in the shifter stop plate..... 
its got to be the right fraction of the move and place to be exactly right./.. 

i have even tried loosening it and finding the gears but it isnt as easy as it sounds,..... 
and on top of that sometimes when you do find them(gears) and then tighten down it wont go back into that gear again .... 

I Need A miracle 

Again thanks for all the help it has been much appreciated whether it seems like it or not... my mind has been tossed over this simple but aggrivating 3-4 inch plate....... 

this is my daily vehicle so just imagine trying to get somewheres knowing you gotta get there and having to drive the whole way across town in 1st and second gears.... NOT...~!~!~!~!~!~!~ 
not for a daily driver maybe if i broke down and had to drive like that to get home but surely thats diffrent and some of us have had to so that and other situations like changing gears with rope shoe strings and some of the other stories i have heard around those fullmoon fires./....././././............ 

Someone come on i know someone has done this before... and DICKooooooooooooooooo someone says you know the answer.... holler if that be true....... ............................~~~~~~~ 

lori you see this??????????? dickoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo 

ohh and i asked jeeves also and he didnt know either..... LOL 
on a serious note,..... this should be a good write up and if there is one ... where?????????????? did i over look it on ratwells site...? 

it just goes over taking it apart and putting it back together but it is not that simple to get it set right back in the same exact place... unless luck is right on your side... in my case.... LUck is only a four letter word...
