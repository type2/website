I had a similar problem with my '79 FI.  Check the EGR valve.  Bentley had a
reference to stalling and idle problems do to a misadjusted EGR valve.
After quite a bit of trouble shooting it turned out my EGR valve was
misadjusted.  I adjusted the valve (so it would not recirculate gas when
cold) and the vehicle idled fine.

&gt; Last night our 78 Transporter finally left the driveway on its maiden
voyage with the rebuild of the 2 liter!  We have only one problem in that
the bus will not idle and stalls if the accelerator is not constantly being
feathered.  Adjustment of the idle screw and accelerator cable doesnt solve
the problem.  We are assuming that some sort of vacuum leak could be the
problem?  The bus is FI and the EGR valve is still there although nothing is
hooked up to it (no hoses, charcoal filters etc.)  Everything else works
great!  Seems like a simple fix or adjustment.  Any suggestions?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Chad
