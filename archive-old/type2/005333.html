I got a window seal for the louvred window on my 79 Devon, but it doesn't
fit at the corners. It's the same as the seal for the regular windows and
Alan Schofield who sold it to me says it should fit OK. Its a West Coast
Metric seal I think

I've just taken the window out again to see if I can improve the fit but no
luck.

I know Westys have a different seal for their louvred windows - perhaps this
would fit better. Anybody done this job?
