It could also be the pilot bearing, it happened to me and i thought it was
the throwout bearing and replaced it only to have to drop the motor again:(
and chisle out the old pilot bearing. but after that it was good.

&gt; . 
&gt;  I have an appointment to have this checked on
&gt; Tuesday, will it hurt to 
&gt; drive it gingerly to work till then
&gt; 
I agree, throw out bearing. Now is the time to learn
how to pull the engine, and replace the clutch. Phil
