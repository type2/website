Subject: Waste water catcher - free pickup Virginia

I have a 5 gallon waste water catcher which I took off my Westy.

Free to good home.

Let me know, and I will leave it out by my mail box for 24 hours, and  you 
can drive by and pick it up.  Possibly could be used by the camper guy from 
the little Fort camp out (who I am trying to contact - re: Virginia 
gazetteer).

On my Westy, it was chained (plastic chain) to the bottom, under the drain 
outlet.  A strongish spring pulled two parts of the plastic chain together, 
and kept teh empty h2O container secure to the Westy bottom.  To drain, 
simply remove the spring, and the H2O catcher came out.  Since water drained 
into the H2O catcher to a hole in near the top of the container, you could 
carry the 5 gallons of waste water to your disposal site like a regular 
jerry can.  The drain hole would be near the top.

You can also simply let H2O catcher lay on the ground under the Westy for 
extended stays, and carry it empty underneath the Westy with the 
chain/spring setup.

(I also have a very nice FI gas tank to get rid of.  Same price and same 
procedure.  Gas tank has a good, working sender.  Does anybody out there 
ever read my mail, other than Karl and Bob??)
