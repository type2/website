Subject: RE: [T2] Spark plugs

I used Bosch Platinum's in my 2.0L and one of the heads melted. Burned a
hole the size of pencil right through the top. I can't point the finger
directly at the Platinum but the problem occurred on a long trip after that
change.

So I agree with those who say they run hotter than a regular plug.
