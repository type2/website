Subject: Re: [T2] replacing dash lights / or repairing dash light wiring

in my 68 you can lay sort of half off the seat under neath the dash and reach 
up to disconect them rather than pulling the panel out.  I know you can reach 
the spedo lights that way, haven't tried the fuel gauge cluster. hope it 
helps.
