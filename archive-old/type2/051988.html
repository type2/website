Subject: [T2] Where is Jon's Motors (NJ/NY listees NOTE!)

Inquiry for NJ/NY listees- I have met Jon, a very knowledgeable VW
mechanic who told me at a show last fall that he was moving from Milford
NJ to another location- anyone know where he is?  I don't think he's on
the list, but I may want to use his services for restoring a 75 bus. 
Thanks
