Subject: South African Vanagon brochure

Off topic for the type2 and vintagebus lists, but might be of passing interest...

For those of you lusting after the latest and greatest.  I have put the sales
brochure for the current South African Vanagon Caravelle on the Unofficial
WetWesties site. (http://members.tripod_dot_com/~wetwesties)  Now all we have to
do is figure out how to do a lists purchase... (I'll take the one in the
photo.  W/O all the happy people though, I have enough of them already...)
