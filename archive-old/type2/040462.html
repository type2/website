Subject: Take photos of Westy stove installation?

Help! Some kind soul had agreed to take some photos of their Westy stove
installation -- and I lost your address! I have a disposable camera
right here... and I've got a Westy stove in pieces in the garage -- I'd
like to have some kind of visual reference to put it together!

If you know who you are -- please contact me! Thanks!!!
