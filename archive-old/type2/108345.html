Subject: re: Valve adjusting screws

I was about to send a post on this because I just had the same problem. When
rebuilding the engine (a complete rebuild), I installed all 8 new adjusting
screws. After the 20 minute burn in, I found that 3 of the 8 were broken!
They didn't just fall away but broke off when I loosened them to readjust
the valves. I got these from a local vendor and after talking with him, I
allowed as to the possibility that I was cranking down on the nut too
tightly when I tightened them (although I have never had this problem in 20
years of regular valve adjustments). Anyway, I replaced all 8 again and am
tightning less on the adjustment this time but I am definitely worried about
this. This is on a stock '71 bus. Any comments or similar experiences?

| Does anyone know where to get properly hardened valve adjusting screws
(for
| a Type 1)?  A few of the ones I got at the online vendor with the
&quot;lifetime
| warrantee&quot;  snapped in half over the last year, and the rest are badly
| mushroomed.  This is after only 6000 miles of driving.  Valve adjustments
| every 1500 miles, for what it was worth with this kind of crap.

| Anyone have a stash of N.O.S.?
