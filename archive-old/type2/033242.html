&gt;I'm just glad they anteed up and fixed them. (it was the same head, btw,
&gt;not two...i'm not sure where the second crack came from...but you can be
&gt;assured i was not happy!)  They offered to pay to have them welded
&gt;locally, also, but i was unable to find someone who felt that he could do
&gt;it (to tight of a space to work in with their gun...)

What I find interesting is that when I called last week and was asking
about their warranty and how often they had problems, the salesperson,
Erin, told me about David's situation (without mentioning names). Her claim
was that this is not common, but that they'll bend over backwards to do the
right thing. I believe her (I want to say that she told me they had 5 or 6
head problems in the last year, but I didn't take notes on that, so I'm not
certain). In fairness to the list, she knew I was a list member and may
have figured I'd heard about the situation David describes. She did tell me
it was a list member.

I think AVP is basically an honest company trying to make a profit on
volume by putting *some* quality practices into place. I don't think
they're going to produce the same quality engine that the old-school
mechanic building one at a time with love for his loyal customers could
produce...or even that they'll necessarily produce the quality product the
most of us *could* produce given the time, tools, and resources. But let's
face it: people who shop at Wal-Mart aren't buying top-notch clothing.
They're getting something functional that will last a pretty long time and
fits their budget.

I've got 2-3 weeks before I get my AVP engine, so I hope I don't eat my
words, but I think they're trying, and the way they've dealt with David is
reassuring. Still, I hope my luck is 2 heads better than his was.
