Subject: automatic trans/FI/ and a dead battery

Ok so in the Muir book it says not to jump a FI engine b/c of over 
voltage to the 'brain' causing damge (expensive damage from what i hear) 
So if i have an auto trans, ie no popping the clutch to start, and i find 
myself with a dead battery...what do i do?  am i just plain screwed??
please repy to me, i had to drop off the list because my university takes 
away from my quota based on volume of email, both in and out.  Im am pissed.
peace
