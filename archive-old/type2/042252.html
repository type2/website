&gt; Well, I just came back from the shop that has my Westy. They managed to get

&gt; The bad news is, the compression is not good: 100-135-135-100. Also, it's 

for a van of that age and level of service the compression is low normal
and I would be more concerned with getting it running first before putzing
with a rebuild.  (much easier I think)

&gt; leaking oil bad on one side--he said the push rod tubes need to be replaced 

no just the push rod seals, and that is an easy backyard job the good
Vitron seals are $14 from Ron (Bus Depot) and will do all 8 push rod
tubes.

&gt; there is a problem with the ignition wiring. The black wire on the left side 
&gt; of the engine that I guess is supposed to go to the coil is not connected and 
&gt; looks melted. He said that will need to be looked into if the bus is ever to 
&gt; start without a separate wire hooked from the coil to the pos. terminal on 
&gt; the battery.

he's finally got something right, but this is a low tech, high labor job,
(all wiring jobs seem to be 10hours to find, 10 minutes to fix) you should
be able to do this yourself.  yes the Bentley wiring diagram is nutty but
it can be figured out.

&gt; So what do I do now? He's working up a price on a rebuild, I told him I might 
&gt; just drive it home. Would it make the drive home w/low compression? It's only 
&gt; about 10 miles, but there are some big hills to go up, unless I go the long 
&gt; way.

bring it home, there should be no major problems with the compression
(other new things maybe)

Good luck
Bob
