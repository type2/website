Subject: Hello again...and Alternator Conversion

Hi all!

I have been gone for a while because I was away at school and my old
computer had about 200 digests which I hadn't read yet so I kind of had
to give it up for awhile.

My &quot;new&quot; '70 Campmobile has been running great after the last top end
rebuild, new tires, adjusted the breaks, new ball joints, shocks, new
hoses all around, and new battery. 

Just befor I put it away for the winter however, the generator light
begain to flicker all the time the engine ran, my lights would dim back
and forth, and there was a lot of interference with my radio.  I checked
to see if the belt was slipping and that wasn't the case, but I did find
that somehow the generator had pretty much distroyed the pulley without
accually throwing it off,

I am planning on changing over to an alternator setup, and while I was
at it I think I'm going to throw in a 009 and a blue coil.  Do you thing
changing over to an alternator will illiminate my problems, or would it
just compound something else.  This is on a bone stock 1600 dual port
with about 20,000 miles on the short block and about 6,000 miles on the
pistons, cylinders and heads.

Any help is always welcome!!

Thanks all!!
