more info on the web page here:

&gt; &gt; So here's an interesting proposal I post to the list. I know of a 75
&gt; &gt; westy here local w/ an interior i would like to transplant into my 79
&gt; &gt; 7-pass. Problem is he wanted $1000 first then later backed down to $700
&gt; &gt; for the bus. I really don't need the body or engine/trany (1979 2liter
&gt; &gt; w/ FI) but want the westy interior. Anyone wanna look at pooling money
&gt; &gt; together. I just don't have the cash, nor do i need the rest of the bus.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; For those interested, here is what I know. new brakes and apparently
&gt; &gt; recently rebuilt engine (but he has been running it w/o engine seal so
&gt; &gt; that may be all for naut). Bus runs but that's all i know about the
&gt; &gt; drive line. Body in OK shape w/ rust here and there. I might snap some
&gt; &gt; pics next time i drive by if anyone is interested. It's located about 20
&gt; &gt; minutes west of Nashville, TN, USA. Contact me directly w/ anyone
&gt; &gt; interested, i doubt the list cares :)
