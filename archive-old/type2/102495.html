Subject: Ethical Dilemma - Westy Interior

I have a '74 Westy hardtop. It's my daily driver as well as my vacation home.
It's not the greatest bus ever, but it's mine. I treated all the rust and
painted it (red, white and blue!) with Rustoleum out of a can. The engine is
old but runs great (especially since Dad and I overhauled it at Xmas). But the
engine is anything but original. Might actually be the original block - but
that's as far as it goes - Weber progressive carb, fan shrouds off a later
model, '75-'79 style exhaust, etc., etc.

Generally my bus is just like most - still running and drivable but no where
near original... Except: the original Westy cabinetry is still in there:
fold-down table, working electric sink, cooler (not the fridge). It's all in
great shape.

My dilemma is that the cabinetry is completely impractical for me. I never use
the sink, the cooler sucks because it always leaks, and it would be great to
get rid of the suicide cabinet in the back and have a full-width bed. Should I
take out the cabinetry and replace it with my own? I hate to remove the last
'original' aspect of this bus - but I don't have the means to full restore
this one or get a different bus.

If anyone is interested in '74 cabinetry, I'd be willing to part with it cheap
- especially if it's going into a '74. By cheap, I mean I'd be willing to let
it go for the cost of the lumber to build my own cabinetry.

Any thoughts are appreciated!

-Eric
