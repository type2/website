&gt; Probably not do-able.  There will be a physical limitation to the voltage you
&gt; can achieve with solar panels on the roof of a normal-sized vehicle.  Even a
&gt; 96V bus will need about 250 individual cells and there just isn't room for
&gt; that many on the roof.

This may be a pipe dream (oh, if only reality were dictated by press
releases) (or then again maybe not) but instead of increasing efficiency,
perhaps you could skin the entire bus with photovoltaic material if the
material didn't cost much:
