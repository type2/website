Hi everybody-  I solved the  '79 head/'76 exhaust problem in my shop
today.   I ended up measuring the casting against the two different
heads, spending about an hour making a
fixture, then milling the ends down to the meat of the casting where the
ears are.  Moved the vise/fixture to the surface grinder and trued
everything up.  I did have just a little id of the pipes visible when
the gaskets were laid in place, so some shallow plunge cuts with a ball
end mill matched it up better.  AVP said that they would send heads or
exchange engines, but that's another $200 and two weeks that I don't
have.  This worked out ok.

I guess nobody looked at my webpage or they would have seen I have more
equipment then a pair of pliers and a roll of duct tape. :)

This bus is going to be my (only) daily driver on June 11th, so time is
of the essence.

Peace,

Scott
