Subject: Re: [T2] Going up north next week--BC suggestions

BC mainland advice;
BC is over twice the size of California so it takes time to see 
everything. Compare these suggestions with a map then plan your trip.

(mandatory bus content) Notice the density of bay buses in Vancouvers 
&quot;Kitsilano&quot; neighborhood.  One of the highest in the world.  (average 
2 or 3 buses on each sidestreet)  Smile and wave to all bus drivers 
you see.

The drive from Vancouver to Whistler on a clear day is incredible, 
drive it before they get awarded the 2010 Olympics and things get 
more crowded with road construction.  Whistler is great, but somewhat 
expensive and yuppified.  Meager Creek hotsprings north of Pemberton 
is a wonderfully remote camping area with natural hotsprings.  Try 
the Duffy Lake road from Pemberton to Lyton.

In the interior, Nelson and Kaslo are fun little towns.  Make sure 
you visit Ainsworth hot springs and take &quot;the worlds longest free 
ferry ride&quot; across Kootney lake.

Visit the Okanagon valley &quot;wine country&quot; around Oliver and Osoyoos. 
Excellent Indian restaurant on main street in Oliver if you can 
believe it.

If you go through Grand Forks, stop at the Grand Forks hotel for 
their world famous Borsch soup.

Drive the scenic Trans Canada highway 1 &quot;Fraser Canyon&quot; route between 
Hope and Kamloops instead of the newer toll highway 5.

Remember, BC is beautiful, as the license plates say.

&gt;Hello all
&gt;
&gt;Next week (June 12th) I will be heading from Reno NV
&gt;to Seattle in my 79 Westy to pick up my wife from the
&gt;airport on the 15th and off we go to British
&gt;Columbia/Vancouver Island to hike the West Coast Trail
&gt;starting on the 18th. We plan on taking anywhere from
&gt;four to six weeks up in B.C. traveling around with no
&gt;destination in mind.
