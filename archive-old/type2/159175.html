Subject: stinger S2402 multi-battery isolator

A friend of mine has one of these he isn't using ( 3 post 95amp model).  
Is it as simple as attaching the alt to the middle post and the 
batteries to the A and B posts and then rewriting my radio, interior 
lights, and 12v power outlets to one battery and leave the rest on the 
other?  Does anyone have any experience with this product or other 
multi-battery isolators?  I've heard lots of talk about installing 
second batteries into out busses, but I wasn't able to find reference to 
multi-battery isolators.

TIA,

dan
