dave
wrt the loose axle nut syndrome which we will now refer to as LANS.
I think the chronic culprit is actually the drum itself. Its is softer
than the spacers or stub and I think the splines wear starting the chain
of failure.
I also suspect that the reason we always seem to see it on the right side
is that it is the driven wheel on CV busses.
I recently pulled a chronic one on the 68 and replaced the bearings
although they were not visually defective at all. and the drum which was
way shot.
