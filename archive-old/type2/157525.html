Subject: rear hatch torsion bar replacement

Hello List,

The torsion bars that raise the rear hatch on my 68
bus are sprung. the joints in the arms that connect to
the torsion bars are worn as well. Has anyone ever
replaced these bars? I was staring up at them while
camping a couple of weeks ago and I think I know how
to remove them. I am just looking for some advise and
tips. Also, I will have pictures of my trip to
Linville Falls soon. Boy, do i have a story to tell.
Thanks!

David Kelly
