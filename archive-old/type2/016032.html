http://www.baja_dot_com/kombi/ is a pretty good resource, regardless of
whether you're going off-road style or not.

I would think your first step would be sitting down with an RPM/MPH 
calculator
(available in a lot of places for free on the net) and checking out how 
an 18&quot; mag
and associated tire is going to effect your RPM _at_ specific MPH and as a
result, your cooling ability at certain speeds.

In addition, you might want to compare those numbers to David Schwarze's 
power/torque v. RPM
chart that he has for his bus and make a spreadsheet of how much 
torque/power you'll have at
given speeds in different gears.

Since that can all be done on paper, I'd do that before I'd do anything.
