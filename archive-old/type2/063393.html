Yes, it will fit.  The effective length is adjustable, so it works to 
check oil level as well.  You add your own &quot;full&quot; and &quot;add&quot; marks to the 
sender dipstick by slightly scratching the dipstick with a file, using 
the old one to guide where you put the marks.  Installing the sender is 
about the simplest thing I've ever done on the bus.

I've had mine 2 years.  Love it.  Works great.
