Subject: Re: [T2] Junk Yards OBX NC

Hey Barry,

I live in Wilmington, North Carolina. I have heard of
a few towards the inland areas but I do Know of one
near the coast in Jacksonville, NC that is good. They
have a large lot of old busses, bugs, ghias,you name
it. Their prices are reasonable for the east coast
too. The name of the place is Cox Motor Company. Their
address is:

Cox Motor Co.
258 Wilmington HWY. HWY.17 SO.
Jacksonville, NC 28540

Their phone number is (910) 347- 4874
You should be able to get directions from Yahoo map or
Map quest or some service like that. Good Luck!

&gt; May I ask, are there any 'junk yards' or private
&gt; stashes along the Outer 
&gt; Banks, North Carolina?
