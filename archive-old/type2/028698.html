They should take even less than 500.00. I bought back a 6000.00 HD for
100.00.

&gt;Buy her back and fix her.  You'll have a Westy and be money in the bank.

I AGREE!!!  I did this once with another vehicle.  Tell your insurance
company that you want to buy her back for $500.  They will probably be glad
to get that much and you will be able to restore her to as good as she was
before the flood.  It takes more than a little water to put down a good
type2!
