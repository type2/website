Subject: Re: [T2] [Fwd: Tach/Dwell Meter Usage Question?]

&gt; I just got a used Tach/Dwell meter from someone on ebay to do the points
&gt; on my 82 aircooled van. The dwell meter is electronic and works on my
&gt; Isuzu. When I connect it to the coil on the vanagon, I cannot start the
&gt; van. It seems to short or load down the signal.
&gt;
&gt; What gives?  Is this an indication that the coil is going or that only
&gt; the older dwell meters can be used? Incompatibility with the AFC
&gt; L-Jetronic fuel injection system?

Jeff,

First, it sounds like you are hooking it up incorrectly.  the black lead
goes to Ground (the engien case or fan shroud), the red wire goes to the
terminal on the coil that the lead from the distributor (usually green)
goes to.  If yu hook it to the other lead on the coil, then you are indeed
creating a path from power to ground, shorting the circuit and the bus
will not start.

Second, if your bus is a California model and has electronic ignition (or
just has electronic ignition), checking the dwell is not a good idea.
Some dwell meters are safe for use with electronic ignition, some are not
and I don't know which are and which are not.  Since dwell on an
electronic ignition system is not adjustable, there is not sense in
checking it.
