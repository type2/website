&lt;&lt; **14. MANUFACTURING: ANYTHING OLDER THAN A VW BUG? - NBC NEWS (US)

We're doing a story about the last VW Beetle Bug. It will be produced at the

Puebla, Mexico, factory soon. Our question: Can anyone name a modern piece

of machinery that has been around longer, basically unchanged, than the

Beetle? The Beetle Bug was first built 1938-1940 (depending on start date

you choose). No phone calls, please.

Need leads by 05:00 PM US/Eastern JUL 27

My '62 Morgan 4/4 is basically the same as the original '36 4/4...And the 2003
4/4 is quite the same, again. The sliding pillar front end (original in 1909) 
is
still the same. BTW, '36 was THE big year in Morgan changes...That's the year
Morgan introduced the 4/4 - 4 wheels/4 cylinders - prior to that all Morgans
were &quot;trikes&quot;, three wheelers with JAP, Matchless, Blackbourne motorcycle
engines for power...Trikes were in production until '51, the last ones with 
small EnFo (English Ford) engines... :-)
BTW, the grandson of the original founder of the company, now runs it...
