Subject: VDO tachometer problems

I got the 80mm VDO tachometer and the ring to mount it in the clock 
hole. It looks great. I've verified it's set for 4cyl. The thing is 
horribly inaccurate. It shoots from 4k to 7k in an instant. It seemed to 
get a little better after installed diode 1N4005 as noted in the forum 
archives. What am I missing here? This is VDO P/N 333-051.

I replaced my points and timed the engine a few weeks ago.  I haven't 
rechecked the gap, but dwell is currently at 50 +/- a few 10ths with RPMs.

Any ideas?
