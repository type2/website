&gt;I would like to offer a safe haven to any and all fellow travellers out
there.
&gt;If your in the Utah area, my driveway (and more) is available.  I don't
&gt;want to have to read about another Kirstin.  Please feel comfortable
&gt;staying at &quot;Camp Blackham&quot;.

Me too.  I remember struggling with offering my driveway to a listee from WI
who needed a last minute place to go the to Auburn Hill show.  I finally
figured out I wasn't being as open as I wished I were and made the offer,
and when I met Isaiah at the show was confirmed that an open house is a good
thing.  I know full well not everyone can or should take that stand, but I'm
going to try it here anyway.  I don't ever want to read about another
Kristen, either.  Maybe we'll all read about one less.  I hope so.

Hang together, I say.
