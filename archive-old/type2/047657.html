Subject: Re: [T2] Brake warning light concerns

&gt; While driving the 68 today the brake warning light came on. first it
&gt; flickerd, then it came on bright red. the brakes seemed to be functioning
&gt; properly, so I checked and toped off the fluid(only took a bit) it wasn't on
&gt; when I started the truck again, but came on again later.

I don't know much about this light. It stopped working on my '78 Kombi
at some point in history, never was able to fix it. I figured that I
would notice when thing would get bad. If I were you I would go through
the whole system and check if there is anything leaking (hoses,
cylinders, brake lines, etc.) If nothing is leaking than hopefully it is
the light that's wrong.

A friend of me owns a 1982 Mexico bug. He had the same light going on
for years everytime he pushed the brake. I thought &quot;that's interesting:
a light that indicates if your brake lights are working&quot;, until he told
me what the &quot;B&quot;-light really stood for. Anyway, the brakes worked fine
all those years.
