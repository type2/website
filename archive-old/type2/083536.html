Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [VB] How do you remove oil filler piece?

Thanks to all for the advice.  Based on what everyone said, I decided to apply a little more force from different directions.  I took a hammer and a block of wood a tapped on the piece and noticed that it moved about 5 degrees.  I then pulled it back.  I repeated all of this for about twenty times.  The piece was now moving about 10 to 15 degrees.  I then used the removal tool to apply torque while I turned the piece towards the front.  I did this for about ten times.  Finally the threaded ring started to move.  Once it started to move, it easily unscrewed.
