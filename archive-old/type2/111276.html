Subject: Re: [T2] Stuttering and Cutting Back

hey cha, your not gonna like what i say :) but you need to set timing
&amp; carbs all up again. Reason I say this. If you got it running decent
w/ the brake booster off then you were compensating for a HUGE vacuum
leak. By sealing it up again suddenly you set the engine way off.
Start w/ timing if possible &amp; then carbs. I suspect you will find it
runs much better than before.

Oh BTW if you have an 009 distributor you timing won't change w/ the
vacuum leak, just set the carbs again.
