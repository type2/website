Subject: Re: [T2] Remove taillights

Chuck,

Thanks for the confirmation!  I was pretty sure that the '72 had the
rectangular lamp holders, but I also know that as soon as I posted the
description for that, someone would post on their early '72 with oval
lamps :-)

Grant,

What Chuck warns of is definitely true... the studs are held in place by
their heads being cast into the 20+ year old plastic.  That plastic is
very brittle and will break up at the slightest provocation (as I said in
my earlier p-mail... they are old enough to vote and drink :-).  Be *sure*
to (a) remove the lens so you can watch the bolt heads and (b) spritz the
studs with penetrating oil (Kroil is my favorite) before you attempt
removal of the nuts.  If the plastic begins to break up anyway, clamp a
vice-grip on as best you can and plan on buying a new bucket.

Anyone selling the Brazilian replacement buckets these days?  I know I
bought a pair a couple years back, but have not seen them recently.  And
on that note, be careful!  The imported buckets are fine, and in 99 and
44/100% of cases the lenses are fine, *but* the Brazilian lenses do not
have the DOT stamp cast into them that US law requires and you can (I did)
fail safety inspection on this point... I will not express my opinion of
the inspector who &quot;discovered&quot; this bit of trivia.
