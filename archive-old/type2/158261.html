Subject: good puzzle for you guys

hey guys  I am putting a 58 single cab back on the road for a  good  friend 
of 
mine that has been off the road for probably 15 years .  It came with a  
bunch 
of NOS parts ,including a bus rear bumper, crank  style apron, third brake  
lite decklid, and OE tilt with hoops. He is  trading me the bumper and tilt 
for  
getting the truck road  worthy.  All goes good rebuild the motor , fix the  
brakes, get it  inspected. . I drive the truck over the weekend to work out 
any  
bugs.  As I am going home the headlite quit. I go well ain't that strange. So 
  
today I take a look at it and find that the high and low and both hot at  the 
 
same time.So I get my power probe and start checking the circuit  and find 
that  
there isn't any ground to the headlites. So I trace the  ground wires and see 
 
that they run back into the lite wire  housing.  I start thinking to myself  
that that is odd,normally  they just ground right inside the headlite area. 
So I 
go inside the truck  and only find the lite wires,NO Ground wires in there at 
all.,I find that to  be real confusing, so I go back out to the headlites and 
pull on the ground  wires and they come out of the factory housing ,still 
looped  together.  They had never been hooked up at all. I think I just got 
punked 
by   some factory worker from 1958  LOL  . One neat thing I did find  inside  
the headlite housing was somebody had wrote Blau  with  their fingers in the  
factory paint. Just another strange day of  working on VWs  later and have  
fun
