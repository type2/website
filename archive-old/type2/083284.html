Subject:  shifter grinds into 3rd gear???

hello all,

my shifter makes a grinding noise when i put it into
third gear. id say it does it 3 out of 5 times.
shifting up from second or down from fourth makes no
diference. most times it is just noticable but
sometimes it is downright violent and seems to be
coming from the floor directly beneath the shifter,
any ideas or remedies?

thanks in advance. as always any answers, opinions, or
insights will be greatly appreciated.
