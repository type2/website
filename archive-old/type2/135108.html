Subject: Re: [T2] Front bearing question...Thanks to all who responded

| My final question. Does anyone know what size e-clip goes on the speedo
| cable to keep it from pulling through the hub. Mine was all bent to crap
| and looked like it was the wrong size anyways. Stupid 30 cent part
| keeping me off the road.

I lost mine and replaced it with one from a &quot;HELP&quot; assortment at my FLAPS.
It has been working for a few months now.
I thought about replacing it with a circlip for ease of installation, but 
didn't try it.
Let me know how it goes.
