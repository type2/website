Despite my ignorance, I guess it's a Mining Engineers alagory for a
blasting cap, from a Surveying Engineer that likes to make machines work
right, not the least of which are T-II's. I been looking for good muffler
bearings for a long time. Most of them don't last 10,000 miles. What I
didn't see on the site was the magnetic bumper bolts. Some of the best
wizbang I've seen since Firesign Theator.
