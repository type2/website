Subject: Re: Got new starter - strange connections

&gt;Also, the starter came with a new bush for the shaft to fit into.  Is this
&gt;really that important to replace?  If so, how do you get the old one out
&gt;without taking the engine out to drive it out of the hole from the other
&gt;side of the housing?  

Yes, it is.  If you don't, you'll eventually ruin the new starter!

2 ways: use a bolt of the appriate size to screw into the old bushing and
pull it out, or, pull the motor and push it out with a socket or something.
