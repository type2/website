Subject: 74 oil capacity

All of the literature I have indicates that the oil capacity of my 74 bus
(and all air-cooled 72 on) is 3.7 quarts with filter change. My engine seems
to take about 4.5 quarts before the dipstick reads full (top line). What's
going on here? Something else I've noticed is that if I leave the dipstick
in for a while it will indicate a higher level. In other words, if I wipe it
off, put it in and immediately pull it out it will read full. But if I leave
it in for a few minutes it will read more than full. What are the
consequences of overfilling the oil?
