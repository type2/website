Subject: Why drive a VW bus?

I drive a VW bus for several reasons.  I read online sites about making a 
BAJA BUS, and I liked the idea.  I found a 72 for $350, dents and all, so I ended 
up making it into a BAJA BUS.   

Second reason, is that I live in a small, but very politically town.  It has 
very outspoken liberals, including their buses.  So, I put several stickers on 
my bus, but not the type you think.  One sticker reads...&quot;SHUT UP HIIPPY&quot;  
another says &quot;BAD HIPPIE, NO BONG HIT&quot;.  The third is a decal with a bunch of 
burnt trees, and the slogan &quot;HUG THIS HIPPIE&quot;.  Did I mention that it is 
camoflauged and has off road tires?  Yep, that's right.  It's an ANTI-HIPPIE bus.  
Its a blast to drive and lots of people smile.  Especially when I drive it to 
work in my police uniform.

Have fun and don't take life tooooo seriously,

John
