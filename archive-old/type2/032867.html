The person is a Lehigh University student and I'm in the area.  If you're 
serious enough, let me know and I can take a look at it and take some digipics 
to mail you.  However, please make sure you talk to Avery first to get more 
details.

I believe the asking price was $2750.

Karl,
Here are some particulars on the bus. When I say not much rust I mean it,
this is my 4th bus and it is a beauty comparatively.  You can still see
the original paint under the wheel wells, it is in very good condition
rust wise.

More info:

Good condition, very very minimal rust restricted to a dent in the rear
left corner and some spots in front and rear floor. There is no major body
rot or serious rust! Rocker panels are in good condition.

Paint scheme is the original paint colors of red on lower body and white
on top, (interior is white throughout except for front steps and engine
compartment which are red)  BTW it is a true red, not salmon or orange.
All vinyl panels and seats are black.  Front and middle seats have
headrests.  All vinyl in very good shape.  This is a 7 passenger walk
through model.

Miles I believe are somewhere around 116,000 although I am not certain
about that. Engine is in fairly decent shape but could us a tune-up. Fuel
injection was removed (not by me) no parts left over. Heater works well
for the model and year, meaning it is not superb but that is a design
issue. Air conditioning is factory installed but compressor is missing.  I
had planned on switching the inline fans for the air conditioner over to
the heat source to get more airflow this winter. Sunroof is presently not
working.  2 New cables included ($115.00 Wet Coast Metric).  Sunroof does
not leak b/c previous owner installed a vinyl panel that snaps into place
over the sunroof instead of fixing it the cables. Some rust around sunroof
frame, should be a simple repair to get the sunroof working.  Some sinful
previous owner put some bondo around the sunroof. I don't know if the
engine and trans have been rebuilt.  It runs well.

I had planned on making this bus a very respectable show vehicle and I do
not think it would take very much to do so.  For a daily driver all it
needs is a tune up. The only current maintenance it needs is Rear CV
service or wheel bearing. There is an intermittent knocking noise in the
right rear suspension that never seems to make a sound when it is at my
mechanic but pops up every now and then.

I am moving and must sell this bus ASAP, fast fast
Any reasonable offer will be considered.

R. Avery Oldt

Hi, I'm interested in the VW bus.  Can you tell me more about it and its
history?  When you say not much rust, how are the rockers panels?  Any
Bondo?

How many miles are on it and has the engine or trans every been rebuilt?

Thanks,

-Karl
