Subject: Re: [T2] I am REALLY stumped now!

&gt; I posted earlier about the headlights that will work
 only when the ignition switch is in the OFF position.
 I followed the wiring diagrtam and everything looks
 good. ALL other lights work as they should including
 turn signals and parking lights. The parking lights
 work with the key on, but not the damn headlights.
 WTF?!?!?!?! Anybody have any clue why this could be??

 ========================================

Does the black/yellow wire going to terminal X have power?
With the key on?
With the key off?
It comes from terminal X on the ignition switch and goes to terminal X
on the light switch. Appears to only have power when the key is on and will power up the headlights only when
the key is on and the light switch is pulled
out.
