Subject: Re: [T2] Sliding Door Tune-up

When you slide it into position do you mean it wont latch at all or it wont
close fully. If it latches but doesn't close remember to lift the handle up,
that action pulls the rear of the door in and closes it. You probably
already know this but it amazes me how many people slam the doors to make em
shut

Subject: [T2] Sliding Door Tune-up


&gt; Greetings All,
&gt;
&gt; I'm trying to get my sliding door (70 Bus) to function as it should.  Or
at
&gt; least the way I think it should.  My take on this is that the sliding
door,
&gt; when moved forward, should &quot;pocket&quot; itself in the door space so that it
can
&gt; be latched in place.  Am I right so far?
&gt; I've had to push the rear end of the door into the door space so that I
could
&gt; latch it in place.  Of course this makes closing the slider from the
inside
&gt; of the bus impossible.
&gt; So..............  I took out the center rear sliding hinge link and
cleaned
&gt; and rebuilt that thing.  As a matter of fact everything at the rear of the
&gt; door is cleaned and lubed.  The door has been adjusted ala Bentley.  The
fit
&gt; is perfecto!
&gt; However the door still doesn't want to move into a latching position.  It
&gt; will do so if I really reef on the door and send it forward with a slam.
&gt; But, it seems to me, that I should get the &quot;closing action&quot; with a lot
less
&gt; force.
&gt; Any kind souls out there have any helpful hints for me?
&gt;
&gt; As always, TIA
&gt;
&gt; Mike
