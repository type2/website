Hi Volks,

while the discussion of AAA+ membership is off-charter,
I can understand your need for it.  But as a non-US
list member I'd like to urge you to mark such US-only
discussion topics with an appropriate subject line,
such as [US] AAA+, so that we non-US listees can filter
for (or rather, against) them more easily.

TIA!

Airhowlingly yours,
    Erik.
