Thanks to Matt and Rick for getting my order and providing excellent customer
service!!  Especially with dealing with the UPS mix up.  Dealt with you for
years, but this has been even better than the times before!!  Thanks you will
receive more orders from me, especially since my bus is in need of TLC.  I
just need $.
Peace
