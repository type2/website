Subject: Re: Jackstands 

First VW I owned, a '64 bug, and me without a driveway.
So I worked in the street, like everyone else round there.

One day, lying under the bug, an inept parallel parker
knocked the bug off the jackstands by running into the front
with me under the back doing something or other with the 
valves.  I saw it coming just in time.  Closest call yet.

Came out with a wrench intending to remove her backup lights
at a minimum, but she saw me and drove off.  Ran the stop
sign as I recall.
