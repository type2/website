I saw one of these, in a parade, a few years back (must have been in the 
early 80s). He covered the body of a car with sod. The commentator 
mentioned the vehicle... and said it weighed in at 4 tons, or something 
like that.

A couple years later, I saw another in a magazine. They guy took the 
body off a beetle, and used a framework to support the fenders and the 
sod covering. Imagine taking out the lawn edger to check the oil level.
