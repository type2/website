To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hello all,
 I am stumped on this ,,
 I just added a dog house oil cooler(new) and an
alternator to the 1500 singleport in my 68 . I have a
berg temp stick in the motor and it is comming on at
any speed over 50 mph. I have the timing set at TDC
with 28 degrees total advance. The points are new and
gapped correctly, newer coil, condenser. The carb was
rebuilt not to long ago , both screws are set at 3
turns. the oil cooler is new an the mounts oil
passages are unobstructed. the oil is fresh and at the
correct line .The valves are adjusted correctly. It is
running real hot and gives off that over heating motor
stank. I dont know what else to do....  and ideas
would be helpfull
Thanks in advance
----Bryan
