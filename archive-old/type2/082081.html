Subject: Exhaust related problem

Hello. 
I've been through the archive but didn't find any notes pertinent to my
particular situation, so I'm asking for some diagnostic help.  I recently
bought a '78 transporter, that at the time had a louder than normal exhaust.
I left the exhaust initially, and did a tune up  - new wires, plugs,
condensor, points, gapped it and set the timing. When I was done it idled
fine, ran pretty well, but sounded like a dragster - the exhaust had already
gotten louder in the two weeks I'd had it. A few days later, I started
driving it to the mechanics, 8 miles away, to address the exhaust problem.
The bus was coughing and sputtering until the muffler finally fell off. I
tied it up, and coughed and sputtered the rest of the way to the mechanic.
He replaced the heat exchangers (not sure of the make but the sticker says
they're from Denmark) and said it was all set,  but running rough. I went to
pick it up, and it would turn over and start up, but wouldn't hold an idle
for more than 30 seconds and would choke whenever you stepped on the gas.
You really have to work the gas pedal to keep it running. Driving it was out
of the question. The mechanic has adopted the position - &quot;I just worked on
the exhaust, anything else is your problem&quot;, so I don't really have a great
working relationship with him, though he's supposed to be the local VW
mechanic.

Any thoughts or info is greatly appreciated.
Thanks
Mat
