&gt; 76 FI stock Westy.  Driving up a slight incline on Friday and

A lot of the time backfires come from leaks in the exhaust, but I
usually have heard these when going down an incline. I'm a little
stumped as to why it backfired. One thing you should know is that
sometimes the backfire can force the &quot;flapper thingie&quot; in your afm to
slam back possibly breaking or sticking close. I would check this
first. Hopefully you can get the bus to start again &amp; then drive it
easily home to look into the backfire issues better. Take a look there
first &amp; report back.
