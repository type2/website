Subject: Re: [T2] Re: dash lights

the rheostat in my sc has been bad since I bought it. I just ran the dash 
lights off of another spade on the switch. terminal #56 or 58 can't remember 
which, I think it was the one for tail lights though. works full bright only, 
but thats how I use them anyway. 

&lt;&lt; Wonky dash lights are caused by the light switch's rheostat wire breaking
 (a little curly wire in a ceramic housing with one end connected to power -
 a wiper rides this to pick off current; the further along the wire from the
 current source, the more resistance, the dimmer the lights).
 When the wire breaks, you can only get as bright as the unbroken length
 lets you. If all this makes sense.
 Warning: replace the switch as soon as practical; the broken wire can
 spring out, short to the dash and casue a fire. Having said that, mine has
 been this way for 6 months, coz I have a 70, and the replacement switches
 available are all wrong for my bus.
