Subject: [T2] Internal dimensions of bus

Does anyone have a diagram(s) showing internal measurements of a bus? I'm
sure i've seen one before either in old sales literature / manuals or on the
web.... or maybe I dreamed it. 

I'd like to completely re-design the interior of our bus, and cannot get
accurate measurements without stripping it out.
