Subject: Re: [T2] question abou parts

&gt; Welcome, where are you in the world?

:-))))
Poland :-))))

The thing is - for me it is much easier to order and get car parts from USA
than i.e. from UK or Germany.
That is of course stupid and strange but it is true.
I own also other cars - among them there is Military Chevrolet Blazer called
CUCV M1009 and I used to order everything I need from US and I will
contiunue with VW parts :-)

Thanks for help with http sites. It will help me a lot.

Piotr
