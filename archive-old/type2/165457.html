&gt; Hi Nathan,

&gt; Dropping the transmission with the engine is no major sweat, but I
&gt; would NOT recommend trying to install them together, particularly not
&gt; if you are working alone. Way too heavy to manage, unless you have a
&gt; particularly good jack available.

If it's an early bay like mine, removing and installing the engine and
transmission together is the only way to go!  I can't imagine trying to
mate up an engine to a transmission that is barely dangling on chains or
somesuch.

If you have a floor jack, bolt a foot-square piece of 3/4 or 1&quot; plywood to
the &quot;cup&quot; to provide a flat surface.  The balance point is about where the
engine joins the transmission.
