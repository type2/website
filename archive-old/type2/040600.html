Subject: Re: CV Joint (Half Shaft)

If you can, find a mechanic that sells half shaft complete.  The do make
these for about 100.00 per axle shaft completer with lifetime warranty on
the complete component.  This comes with the shaft, boots and bearings.  Its
cheaper this way.  The parceling out of the parts is another way of
separating you from your money.  I will get with my mechanic at Auto Haven
here in Leavenworth, Ks.
You can call him.  Todd Marshall is the owner.  He &quot;sells them all day
long.&quot;

&gt; &gt; My wife took our 74 VW Westfalia (her daily driver) into Midas today to

&gt; &gt; no big deal.

was

&gt; you wife was getting the &quot;shaft&quot;

and
&gt; &gt; that it was grinding knuckles away.  I have no idea what grinding
knuckles
&gt; &gt; away means.  Has anyone ever had to actually replace the large metal
axle?
&gt;
&gt; have never heard of a half shaft going bad from use, I'm sure it has
&gt; happened but in 35 years of VW's I have never seen a bad one
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I'll probably go ahead and replace the cv joints (about due according to
&gt; &gt; maintenance schedule).  Does the price quoted for CV Joints usually
include
&gt; &gt; the joint next to the tire and the one at the transaxle per side?  Or am
I
&gt; &gt; looking at buying 4 joints?
&gt;
&gt; you will need 4, but they can be done one at a time
&gt;
&gt; &gt; While I have the CV Joints apart, would this be an opportune time to go
&gt; &gt; ahead and replace the wheel bearings?
&gt;
&gt; makes no difference they are independent of each other
