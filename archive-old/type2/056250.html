Subject: poor fit of WCM outside scrapers with trim

One of the saddest moments in my current restoration
of &quot;buttercup&quot; (bright yellow and white '71 Westfalia)
has been when I saw how badly the fit was for the new
WCM outside window scraper trim in the front doors.
I didn't expect German fit or anything, but I did expect
it to look like it was made for the same door.  The corners
are off a quarter to a half of an inch.  The parts were
wrong on size *and* shape.  The attached rubber was
just as bad.  I wonder if those Mexican type II's have 
different size *and* shape front doors.  My otherwise 
fresh and solid doors are going to leak as bad as they 
look.  The restorer said that was the best he could do 
with parts that &quot;weren't even close.&quot;
v
What are my options?  Who else makes the outside 
scraper trim?  The left was trashed years ago when I 
let a tinkler piddle with replacing a broken window 
regulator.  The restorer ripped out the good original 
stuff on the right, thinking he had good new stuff to put 
back in.  Is it feasible to get those parts in and out of a 
junk yard door without mucking it up? . . .any NOS 
German scrapers left?  Who has parts that will fit well 
enough to not make me want to cry when I look out at 
the MoneyPit, er, uh, I mean &quot;Buttercup&quot;?
v
---end---          the rest of this stuff is more than I wanted 
rant.  I'm *really looking* for new or good used German 
window scraper trim, but I'll post my 2 cents about each 
part (I bought most of them directly from WCM). Most of 
the window seals were excellent, but just a little big to get in 
with a reasonable effort.  The rear side window side seals 
were so big, I could have nearly gotten the German stuff 
for what it cost me to get a professional glass installer to 
moan and groan with them for  30-40 minutes a piece 
threatening to break them with every other breath.  He 
(glass guy) said the rear hatch rubber was &quot;wrong&quot; and 
he just slipped the rear hatch glass in -in a couple of 
seconds using the rear side seals instead.  hmmm!  
Maybe the rear hatch seal would have fit the rear side
glass better.  I haven't tried the rear hatch *door* seal.  
The side cargo door seal appears to be excellent (and 
probably is; I just can't get that door open to adjust it now.  
The left front door seal looks and fits great.  It has the 2 
lipped seal between the door and the cab.  It was very 
hard to close, but it is getting a little better, so I'm optimistic 
about that one.  The right door was a mess.  It didn't have 
the double lipped mating surface. The seal was missing a 
molded corner and was 2 thirds glued in over fresh paint 
(I wasn't there to check it first) before the restorer saw 
that it was twisted at a glued seam and about 4 inches 
too long.  Returns at WCM said it was supposed to be 
&quot;bunched in.&quot;  I protested and he agreed to send me a 
German seal for $140 second day air.  Having an installer 
throwing a fit and threatening to charge extra, I gave in to 
what seemed like extortion at the time.  It's been 9 days, 
and I'm still waiting for the German door seal.  On a more 
pleasant note, the $78 front bumper step pads were worth 
every penny.  They make the bus look new.  The front vent 
wing seals were &quot;ok.&quot;  They fit, but were not as substantial
as the original seals.  I cut and glued them to avoid breaking 
the rivets to get the vent wings apart.  The inside front door 
window scrapers were in worse shape than my 30 year 
old original German, which I reused.  I ordered directly from 
WCM thinking I would get better service and pick of the litter
parts.  Now I'm thinking their smaller (try harder) distributors 
would have been more likely to have sorted out the bad parts 
and for a lot less money.  . . .live and learn
