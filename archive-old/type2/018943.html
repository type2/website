Subject: stuck pistons - brakes
Message-ID: &lt;380419F6.FC7BBB2C_at_vbe_dot_com&gt;

hello all...this problem stumps me...
hope you can help/share an experience or two...
while changing ....er trying to .... my brake pads tonight on my 71, I
encountered a problem with the pistons on both calipers.  one piston on
each caliper is fine and I can push it back to fit in a new brake pad.
The others are stuck, and one won't even let the old decrepid brake pad
come out.  I tried prying them back in like I did the other ones...but
this did not work...they are stuck real good.  this means that I can't
get new brake pads in and can't drive my bus till its fixed.

Any remedies on how to cure stuck caliper pistons??  This also means
that I was only getting 1/2 of the braking power up front...I guess that
explains the skids that my back tires did when I had to come to an
abrupt stop from 40mph to 0mph because some moron's tailights weren't
working...and no..I didn't have a chance to catch his plate number let
alone beep my horn.

please help me out on this as I want to finish it tomorrow....er today.
Am I the only one that works on my bus at midnight??  insomnia of sorts
I guess :) and its the only time I get.

thanks all!
Isaiah
