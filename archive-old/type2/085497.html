Subject: Bumper color


My van has come a long way in the last couple of months after sitting for 4
years with a dead battery and slidged gas tank and it's time to figure out
who I want to paint the exterior here in town.

I'm going to paint it Pastell White; thanks to everyone for all the L90D
paint information they've sent.

Does anyone know what is the original color for the front and rear bumpers?
To me it appears VW made a universal white bumper to put on several
different colored campers.
