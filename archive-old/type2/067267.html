Subject: BA6 gas heater fumes

I have an '82 with a VW supplied auxilliary heater(BA6?) and I get a lot of exhaust type fumes 
when I run it. It seems more so for the first few minutes I operate it. The outlet on this 
doesn't have a pipe on it. Should it? It vents around the back of the transmission and would 
appear to help warm thee engine a bit if used prior to starting in the real cold weather. Is 
this desirable? Do these units tend to rust through and vent fumes because of this?
