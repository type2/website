It's sometimes difficult to get a nut splitter on those heat exchanger
fasteners.  I have air and a die grinder in my garage, but for those who
don't, I've found that a Dremel (or whatever brand) moto-tool is great
for cutting stubborn fasteners in confined places.  Mine has an
extension on it, so that the part that holds the tool, and which you
hold in your hand, is only about the size of a small cigar.
