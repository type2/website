Subject: RE:  Anyone have a steering box lying about?

&gt;Runs fine but the steering is murder.  i was told by a friend who 
&gt;check out the westy that the steering box was just over adjusted. 
&gt;Well i tried to adjust it  and got a little difference but I needed 
&gt;lots of umph to turn the sucker.  My guess is that the box is shot 

This may not be your problem, but tires (brands, sizes, types, and air
pressures) make a huge difference in steering effort.  

I recently replaced the Michelin 195/70/14 on my 73 Westy with Yokohama Y370
195/75/14 LT.  Before the swap, my steering effort at parking lot speeds was
nothing short of Herculean.  I'm in pretty decent shape, but it took both
arms to muscle that sucker around and my wife hated to drive it because of
that.  Now, with the new LT tires on there, steering is a one-hander while
backing out of parking spots.  And turn-in around residential corners is so
much more pronounced that I clipped a few curbs before I got used to it.

So at least make sure your tires are in good shape and properly aired up.
And bear in mind that the wider the tire is the more effort it will require
to turn it.
