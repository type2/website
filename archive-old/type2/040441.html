Subject: too much oil #2 - long 

Pulled engine.  Not seized - turns freely.  Inspected plugs - ok, #2
indicated a slight rich mix.  Drained about a quart of oil.  Changed
filter, replaced main seal and flywheel o-ring (there currently wasn't
one). Visual check inside valve covers - ok.

Assuming blown main seal is the only problem, reassembled everything -
never trying to turn engine over before reinstall.

Turning key = red &amp; green lights and clunk.  Try to turn engine _at_
pulley- no joy.  Push backards in 3rd and bang on solenoid - no joy.
Remove starter - engine will not turn.

Removing engine today after looking at the valves again.

What's up?  Suggestions?

Thanks for being such a great resource.
