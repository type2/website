Lynn,
-remove the lower cover plates, valve covers, rocker arms and push rods.
- lay underneath, reach up and grab a tube and twist it. At the same time stick your thumb in the
corresponding hole in the head and twist your thumb. The combine torque should crack the RTV
seal. If it doesn't repeat but use a pair of small hand plier ( the two setting kind, on the outer setting)
with a piece of rag in between the tube and tool.
- Once you can twist the tube by hand or plier, you can work it out through the hole. If you have
extra tube you have the luxury of ripping it downward in disgust, but don't do that.
- run some emery cloth lightly with your finger round and round the parts on the case and heads
where the tubes will seat. Just enough to remove all traces of RTV. Then wipe with a solvent soaked
rag.
- Using new gaskets on both ends, lay underneath and feed the small end through it's head hole and
down into the case hole, keep the gaskets dry for now.
- when the inner small end and gasket enters the case hole, stick your thumb into the big end of the tube(reach
up and around the heater box to the head) Your thumb should enter the tube until it gets stuck fast, now with
your other hand push from under the motor closer to the small end of the tube near the case. You will feel the
tube move in another half inch and bottom out when you have it right. Now you can twist the tube until the tube
seams face upward. They should twist with some drag to them. You can leave it like that and move on to the others, if so
hold the tube in place from underneath and carefully pull your thumb out. (don't panic, it will come)
If your thumb isn't big enough to get stuck in there, guide it into the inner hole then tap from the outside using a
chair leg that's been cut down and sanded smooth for such a purpose. The key is getting it to bottom out in
the case and having your heads torqued down to the proper torque beforehand. if you decide to use sealant
go with Permatex 3H. Make sure your Oil breather box has a hose ported to the air cleaner/filter.
