Subject: Re: [T2] No new Type II

  VW hasn't given up on the idea of a new Microbus, they are just rethinking the process. They do have designs for the 
NEW Microbus replacement ( a smaller version), but built on a U S approved platform (like the New Beetle) the show 
versions were built on a non U S spec platform (Polo I think), so they changed it to a Golf platform that was allready U 
S approved.
   Version 2 of the NEW Microbus is being based on a U S approved platform, thus cutting major cost. On some of the 
European auto web sites their has been speculation on what it will look like. V W would like to carry over some of the 
styleing themes from the now defunct New Microbus. Did you know that V W o A copyrighted the word MICROBUS a 
few months before the prototype was seen!
   As far as the T5 Eurovan, V W does make those in stripped versions. On my last trip to Germany a friend had rented 
one, very plain jane. Cardboard panels as in an early commercial bus. Plain gray vinyl upolstery on all the seats 
including the middle and back. 5 speed manual trans and a TDI engine. If any of you are familar with Dustun Reitz 
(sp), I have heard through the grapevine that he is going to, or is trying to import a few of the stripped Eurovans to 
the U S. I just wonder if they are allready available in Canada.
   Being that China bought (or is trying to) all the Old Beetle tooling from VW de Mexico, I wonder if they will also try 
and get all the BUS tooling out of Brazil?. Just think in a few years you could buy a new Chinese made BUS!!!!!

    I do have the press kit from the New Micro and hopefully my insider will get me one on the revised version.

&gt;Volks,
&gt;
&gt;I was just reading in the Oct issue of VW Trends that Volkswagen has
&gt;decided not to produce the New Bus.  (Bottom blurb on pg6) Ok, I'm not
&gt;really crying but has anyone seen my hanky? 
&gt;
&gt;I realize that the new would/could not have the elegant simplicity of
&gt;the original.  But it would have been a powerful corporate voice
&gt;whispering the historical importance of the original.  Now it seems all
&gt;we have gotten was a cough, sneeze, snort through the nose.  Do you
&gt;think they are embarassed by us?  Damn you VW, don'y you know we don't
&gt;ALL wear tye-dye shirts and religiously follow the Grateful-Dead year
&gt;after year?  My wife the real estate agent would have loved to have had
&gt;to one parked in the driveway as a rolling monument to familial and
&gt;automotive soidarity.
&gt;
&gt;Oh well, it is nice to have the yet to be named original in the
&gt;driveway.  I came home from the grocery store earlier and a guy driving
&gt;another bay window waved at me, and I waved back.  I see the same from
&gt;the old Beetle drivers also - but I suspect the new Bus owners would be
&gt;moritified by this the same way the rice cannon exhaust equipped New
&gt;Bettle owners seem to.
