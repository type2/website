&gt; Strange... I can't speak for other people but mine have been pretty much
zero-maintenance since I installed them.  Occasionally when the bus has been
sitting for a LONG time (couple of weeks) I get some clatter at startup but
it always goes away once the motor is warmed up.  Definately not a PITA for
me, compared to the... 35-odd valve adjustments I would have had to do if I
had not had hydraulics.  I prefer driving my bus to lying underneath it.

Same here, dave. I have 40,000 miles on my hydraulics with no trouble at
all. I think maybe 2 or 3 times i have had some clatter on startup, and I
think it always happened when I was parked on a steep angle for a period of
time. Anyway, I have only adjusted them once and that was just to see if
they needed it. (They didn't). Sitting in the driver's seat beats lying
under the engine any day.
