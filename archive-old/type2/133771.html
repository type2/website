Subject: RE: [T2] '78 Westfalia

From: &quot;peter&quot;
&gt;Would Like to sell my green '78 Westfalia.  It is complete, but does not 
&gt;run,
&gt;and needs lots of tlc.  Body is decent, small amounts of rust in usual 
&gt;places,
&gt;and windshield needs replaced.  This bus has been sitting since '96 or '97. 
&gt;  I
&gt;personally have had it for about a year, and just don't have time for it.
&gt;Make me an offer.  Anyone interested...please email me off-list.

Sounds a lot like mine only newer! LOL. =D
