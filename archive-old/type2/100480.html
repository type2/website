Subject: Re: [T2] Chugging engine at cold startup and then hard starts
  when engine is warm??

&gt;This new single port engine with a 31pict?? (whatever is stock on them) 
&gt;chugs like it's over choking first thing in the mornings. Takes a few good 
&gt;revs to help &quot;clear&quot; it. After it is fully warmed up and you come back to 
&gt;start it again (say you went to the mall and came back in 5 minutes to the 
&gt;parked car) It is hard to start, just cranks and cranks and then fires up 
&gt;on what seems like about 2-3 cylinders. Then if revved a couple of time it 
&gt;clears and idles ok. Any thoughts on this?? Compression is good right 
&gt;across the board. 1600 sp stock engine.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks, Courtney

Courtney,
	Sounds like the carb is emptying gasoline into the cylinders while it sits. 
  Your carb probably needs some attention.

	Eron
