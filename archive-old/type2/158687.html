Subject: Re: [T2] Front Bumper Tag Holder/Bracket

In a message dated 5/3/06 9:58:53 PM, masato52_at_bellsouth_dot_net writes:


&gt; Since some states required front and rear tags, VOA must have had something
&gt; for this.  Was there something special for this or did they just get a
&gt; generic tag mount and drill holes in the bumper?
&gt;
&gt;
In addition to my NJ tags, I usta have an oval West German plate
on my front-mounted spare until a West Orange (NJ) cop was
kind enough to order me to remove it... ;-(
