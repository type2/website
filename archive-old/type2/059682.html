Unfortunately, I cannot find the &quot;Transporter&quot; font there.  All the
fonts seem to be &quot;modern&quot; VW factory usage.  The &quot;Transporter font had
the integral underline, as the &quot;Volkswagen&quot; on the rear of my '71 has.
 I know it's out there, as I've happened across it before.  I can't
believe that I didn't bookmark the site, though!  Grrrr!
