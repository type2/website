&gt;I agree that this sounds like the valves were not closing. A preload of 2
&gt;turns will cause this.
&gt;
&gt;There is a good method for running in hydraulics on the bostonengine_dot_com
&gt;website. I just tried to go there to paste in the right page link, but the
&gt;site is down at the moment.
&gt;
&gt;Basically, hydraulics should be adjusted to .006 clearance on a new engine
&gt;and the motor run in this way. Then they should be adjusted with preload,
&gt;but not as much as 2 turns, especially if the lifers are brand new.

If adjusted with .006 clearance, will that mean that the valves will
close properly?

I looked at the work order again (with summary of work done) and it
said:  &quot;could not adjust the valves any tighter than 1/8 turn
in-should be 2 turns in&quot;.

Should I re-adjust the valves back to 0.006 clearance i.e. back out of
the 1/8 turn?

I really really really want this thing to run right. :-)
