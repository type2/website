Subject: Firewall Question?

My 72 van never had the firewall above the engine when I purchased it. I 
have since located the rectangular foam (wrapped in plastic) and the metal 
squares (with holes). How are they attached to the underside of the cargo 
area? Are they screwed? Pop Rivet? Welded? etc...


Thanks in advance, Phil
