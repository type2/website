&gt; That's just fine, David. Not having coke or chocolate malt spill in your
&gt; lap and soak into your upholstry 'cause all of a sudden you come up upon a
&gt; turkey neck just as you looked down to grasp that cup for the next suck of
&gt; the straw, and a clean vehicle and ass is less important that the accident
&gt; about to happen is just another viewpoint that predominates in der
&gt; Fatherland.

--&gt; Gosh, I never realized that cup holders were such a controversial
topic.  Personally, I find that driving makes my throat very dry, so I
consider some kind of hedge against dehydration a necessity.  (I don't
generally eat while driving, however.)  A cupholder actually *helps*
safety in this case, since by ensuring the beverage is always in the same
spot, it eliminates the need to take your eyes off the road to pick it up.
It also eliminates all that frantic scrabbling to retrieve a tipped-over
beverage that's rapidly making a mess. ;)

I bought two of those cupholders that are made to hook on the window
ledge, cut off the hooks, then screwed the tabs to the sides of the seats,
using existing screws.  This has worked out really well; the cup holder
ended up in a spot where my right hand naturally finds it, eliminating any
need to look down.  Assuming your beverage of choice has a straw, you need
never take your eyes off the road.

Not *everything* the German designers did when they designed the VW was
for the benefit of the customer, anyway.  Some were obvious cost-cutting
measures.  For example, there is no temperature gauge or warning light on
the VW, basically ensuring damage to the engine in the unlikely event of a
total cooling failure. (Say, a big shop rag stuck in the fan, or
thermostat flaps jammed closed.)  Not only did this save the cost of a
warning light and sender, it ensured they would sell more engines.
