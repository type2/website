Subject: aux battery wiring

type2_dot_com is still down so I can't look this up in the archives.

Does anyone have how to wire the aux battery relay from bus depot.  I
disconnected mine and in the rewiring I must have done something wrong because
I went camping and my battery died quickly and  is still not charged.

Please help I lost my wiring diagram that came with it.

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
