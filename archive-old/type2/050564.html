Subject: Re: [T2] Points vs. Electronic Ignition

Hi,

&gt; Was wondering if those who have replaced their points with an
&gt; electronic ignition would care to comment on the process...

 There are different types of electronic ignition. None of the
ones normally fitted to a bus are really proper electronic
ignitions, because they still rely on the distributor to
control the spark timing. Fitting seems to be pretty straight-
forward for most of them, though a combination approach can
require a bit of thought/advice.

 The two common approaches are points elimination (replace
mechanical switch with magnetic or optical unit) and CDI
(boost spark energy with an extra box of magic). They can
be adopted independently or together and the basic pros
and cons are:

 Points Elimination

 pros
------
        Time saved futzing with points- timing &amp; dwell
        are set for life (of the distributor) no points
        wear means no need to futz with them.
        Degradation of performance with points wear
        eliminated.

 cons
------
        Failure of unit means no spark, many feel its worth
        carrying a spare set of points etc in case of
        emergency.
        No performance improvement, though you do get rid of
        the degradation that happens as the points wear.
        Cost

 CDI

 pros
------
        Much reduced points wear (less current). Need to
        check occasionally as the rubbing block wears.
        Nice fat spark at all revs- helps cold starting,
        some claim an economy improvement.
        Failure of unit can be circumvented by removal.
        Time saved futzing with points.

 cons
------
        Cost
        Points still wear a little- can even break.


&gt; ... and
&gt; proformance after the installation.

 Neither of these makes any real difference to baseline performance,
though some claim a small improvement in MPG. What you do gain is
the elimination of the drop off in performance as the points wear
and the timing drifts between tuneups.


&gt; I have had some problems recently
&gt; with my points (you know if I just bought a new set instead of filing
&gt; away on them) and was curious.  New points are $2.00 to $3.00,

 I wouldn't bother filing points- life's too short.

&gt; electronic ignition kits are $65.00+, is it worth the additional cost.

 In purely financial terms the only way you could justify this would
be if you were losing time you could be billing for while you tune
up your bus. For me, the benefit was not needing to get my hands
dirty every couple of weeks just to tweak the timing and consistant
performance.

 Some of the tradeoff depends on your attitude to solid-state
electronics: if you see electronics as a great boon &amp;
a highly reliable alternative to traditional mechanical solutions
then you are likely to be positive about &quot;electronic&quot; ignitions.
 On the other hand if you like your systems simple &amp; visible, with
opportunities to jury-rig failures and inexpensive components
then you may feel the black boxes are removing some of the basic
utilitarian function of your bus.

 For the record, I have a Pertronix points eliminator and a
Universal Corp. Tiger 581 CDI fitted to my bus. If I had found it
easier to buy the CDI, I might not have bought the Pertronix, but
the way things worked out (I'd had enough of fiddling with the 
dizzy in carparks/the dark/January/Scotland/wearing a suit...)
I already had it when the CDI arrived, so I kept it. 
 The Pertronix has been there for 33,000 miles (two years) and
the CDI for 30,000 miles (two months less). No problems so far,
though it's obviously early days yet. This is a '77 camper
with an otherwise stock two litre engine, and the stock dual
Solexes.

 The Pertronix Ignitor comes in (at least) two versions- for the
stock, vacuum advance dizzy and for the 009. You probably don't
want an 009 on a bus, keep the vacuum one and get the appropriate
Pertronix. I don't know about the other units available, though 
the fact that the major car builders use magnetic, rather than
optical systems would bias me towards the magnetic (hall effect)
ones like the Ignitor.
 I believe it's possible to fit the electronics from a late
aircooled bus (California models?) or even a rabbit or similar
VW to a baywindow bus but I didn't pursue that option. If you
have access to the parts then check the archives/library for
the details...

 Hope this is useful....

Cheers,
	 W.
