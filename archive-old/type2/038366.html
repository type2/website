Subject: Unused muffler tube/connector-Engine Numbers

Hello Type 2 listers:

I've just purchased a new muffler for my '76 Campmobile.  It has a rebuilt 
engine; the origin and year of which I'm not sure.

The old muffler (and new) have a small, flanged connector on the left side 
that does not (and will not) be connected to anything on my rig.  Is it 
necessary to plug this connector?  Should I fashion a small piece of scrap 
metal and bolt (two bolts) it to the connector?  What is it used for?

The muffler is round with a fixed tail pipe on the right side.  It connects 
to each heater box with a three bolt flange on each side.

Also, where is a good source for finding engine number information as to the 
year and type of vehicle installed?  Where on my engine block will I find 
the serial number?

Thanks again for all your help so far.

Best regards,
Walt Fogle
'73 Campmobile
