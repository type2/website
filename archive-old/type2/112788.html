&gt; Subject: intro and engine request...
&gt;
&gt; my name is quincy and i live (currently) in the north bay in california...the first auto i drove was a 70 transporter, and that was it for years....have owned many buses (my favorite) from 57&gt;78....current project is a 69 transporter that i intend to drive to the midwest this fall...but while iam here on the west coast i need a rebuilt motor (no time to do it myself)....having just finished my ba in anthropology, iam also broke....but will be better soon....sooooooooo, iam looking for a 1600 single port (unless someone has a duel with carb/heater boxes, and the other parts for converson) that has limited miles or is a fresh rebuild....i seem to remember a place in hayward that had rebuilds for 700/800 bucks....any word there? or an internet deal i can snap up? or if any of you got one and are on the west coast...

Welcome. You're probably thinking of Buggy House. I doubt if they build their own engines as most VW FLAPS in these parts import their long blocks from one or more of the rebuilding outfits in SoCal. Just make sure you stear clear of GEX engines whether buying direct or from a VW FLAPS.
