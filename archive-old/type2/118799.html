Subject: CamperLightSwitches 

I am going to Mexico in a few days and will be there for a month.  Last time I
was there, a couple of years ago, I found some of the push button switches
that operate the light that is mounted just above the little pull-up table in
camper vans.  I bought all they had (at about  .80 cents each) and sold the
ones I didnt need (at my cost plus shipping) on here to listees.  If anyone
needs these switches please let me know and I will look for more of them.  I
may or may not be able to get them again but can try if anyone needs them.  I
think they are direct replacements except I beleive they are brown instead of
white.  Please let me know asap as I should be leaving this coming Tue or Wed.
Oh, please let me know by pmail, not here on the list.
                                                                             
                                               Bill &amp; Janyce
