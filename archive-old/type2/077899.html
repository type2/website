Subject: Re: [T2] Driving with sliding door open, is it legal?

Hey David, and other honored Volks.

I can't expect that this would he illegal, but then again a policeman did 
tell me that a person could be charged with careless driving while parked on 
the side of the road.  I would point out that the vacuum created while 
driving would pull the exhaust into the interior and could asphyxiate you 
and constitute reckless driving.  As for the hinges it would prolly depend 
on the road conditions and how often and how fast you stop.
