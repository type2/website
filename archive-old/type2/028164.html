Hola,

so the new 75 westy has zero working dash lights except the little ones 
behind the head and air controls (arent those usually the first to go?) so I 
was thinking of tackling that one of these days but im a little nervous.

I was ready to pull the display portion of the dash out when I realized how 
many wires are back there connected to the dash. Geez, am i ever going to be 
able to get it all back together the way it went. Whats a good procedure to 
get everything back where it came from?


somehow mark each wire before I pull it as to where it was?

It seemed at fist like a quick job, but when I first saw that mess back 
there I thought perhaps I should leave well enough alone?

any thoughts/suggestions on the matter are appreciatted.

Tre - 75 westy
