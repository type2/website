&gt;I will repeat my assertion that the issue has nothing to do with shifting.
&gt;It has to do with &quot;flat spots&quot; due to an inadequate advance curve supplied
&gt;by the 009.  

Let me first say that these are all opinions, Muir's opinion, your opinion 
and my opinion, and others opinions. Nobody knows 
it all, and its best that way. I feel that debating a contentious issue while 
making every effort not to be contenious with other 
list members is important, because it prevents homogenization of thinking and 
make cause people to think about things.
I'm the last person that would customize my VW. I make an exception for the 
009 because it's easy, it works and the dead spot
is only an issue if you use it in conjunction with the 34.3 carburator. I 
currently have that set-up on my 71, I switched it from the 
vacuum distributor because I don't like them, vacuum advance distributors in 
general, as opposed to centrifical/mechanical 
advance distributors, which are the more natural and logical choice for the 
VW engine, again IMHO.  If you look at the history 
you see the 34.3 was introduced so the 1600 could pass emissions. I thinks 
its creation was probably an inexpensive way for VW
to pass the emissions laws. Probably much cheaper than designing a carb that 
would pass in conjunction with a centrifical 
distributor. I would never buy a brand new 34.3 because I don't like them. I 
don't think they're good carbs.  I've learned to drive
through the flat spot using this set-up, but I'd prefer a 30pict1 or 2. I 
won't replace the 34.3 until the throttle shaft leaks making 
tuning impossible, at which point I'll throw it into the crate with the dozen 
or so others.

&gt;I see no reason to make this into an &quot;Us vs. them&quot; argument.  The vacuum
&gt;advance distributor can stand on it's own merits as an improvement over the
&gt;older mechanical advance units, as engineered by VW. 

This is true, but an engineering improvement for the purposes of passing 
emissions, and remember the intake was more 
hollowed out and the jets small and this causes occasion flat spots even with 
the vacuum distributor. Also remember the 
vacuum distributor on the 71 bus is a hybrid vacuum/centrifigal distributor 
created to allow the 34.3 to pass emissions. 

&gt;As for other ammenities, it's a free country so you can do what you like.  I 
choose to
&gt;have a bus that accelerates smoothly.  

Me too. and I have one. I run a 30pict1 2 or 3 with an 009 and have no 
complaints.

&gt;I also live in Texas, so I choose to
&gt;have air conditioning in my bus as well.  This does not mean that I do not
&gt;&quot;love, live, and feel&quot; my VW any less than you - I hope that's not what
&gt;you're implying.

I'm not implying that. I'm stating that I don't embrace features engineered 
into the VW to court the American car buying 
public. The German VW's didn't have these things for a reason, when they 
tried to add them on they caused problems.


&gt;I don't consider heat a &quot;feel good&quot; amenity.  I consider it:
&gt;1.  A safety feature - keeps windows clear in the rain, keeps my hands warm
&gt;so I can hold onto the wheel, etc..

Stock heat is fine for me. It keeps the tips of my fingers warm, then I put 
the shift and it warms the sides of my Chuckie T's. 
I live in New York where we have zero degree weather and I don't have a 
problem with the stock heat.

&gt;You wouldn't want to force
&gt;your beliefs on someone else, would you?  I'd rather ride with my S/O in my
&gt;climate-controlled bus than ride alone in my cold, damp but -hey no
&gt;compromises- bus.

I'm not forcing my beliefs on anyone. My wife has a Hyundai. 


&gt;Are you going to also say that front drum brakes are superior to disks?

Yes on Vans they came on. Keep it stock! (except for the vacuum distributor)

&gt;And that vacuum assist is frivolous?  I'm curious.

Not if it came with your van - if it came stock fire it up!   But please 
don't strip other buses to retrofit acessories 
on to busses that didn't come with them. This kills buses and is bad karma.  
Peace.
-Chris
