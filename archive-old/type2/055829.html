Subject: Re: need engine number info

&gt; 
&gt; I have a 1956 Single cab with chassis number 163319, the engine in it
&gt; presently has the following number on it D128023X Can anyone give me any info
&gt; as to what year and vehicle this motor belongs to if not original to this
&gt; truck? Many thanks - Tim in Minneapolis.
&gt; 
Are you sure it's not DI (dee eye) instead of D1 (dee one)?

My copy of Tom Wilson's book lists a DI code as being a replacement
case.  It says about these replacement cases &quot;sold only over the
counter, not supplied in new cars.  All are dual-relief and have 10mm
oil passages.&quot;

The book also says of the DI cases:  &quot;Sometimes a 40-HP part.&quot;

I see no other listings in this table for cases that have codes starting
with D.
