Subject: OT-bug FS, Yardley, Pa, near NJ

About 10 mi from me I spotted a nice blue 72 bug for sale, and caught 
the seller.  Decided to post it for the NJ/eastern Pa crowd as it is in 
very good original condition- 79,000 orig mi  (owner died at 90, his 
son/daughter want to sell it, just up from Va), seats appear recovered, 
have retractable vanagon style seatbelts, (told him I thought it worth 
$2500 when he asked me first-then he said they were asking $3,000), orig 
Saphire radio, only rust I spotted was in one fender well bottom  and 
little pits on chrome; clean spare tire area (never hit), religiously 
had it serviced- did not hear it run (I had to go somewhere)- it is an 
automatic clutch bug.  Engine looked good, dual port. Seller said that 
his Dad had the heat system redone and I am not sure if he meant 
heaterboxes or heat channels-from looking at it it is intact- Pan may 
have been replaced as it looks too good (newer undercoating). 
Brakelines look replaced. Looked under the rear seat and nothing but 
clean painted metal. The owner's daughter Linda Stern is in Newtown, Pa, 
phone 215-860-1621
