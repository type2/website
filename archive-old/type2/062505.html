Subject: Columbus Day Mid-Atlantic Camp-out? Response

Around that time of year(October?) is oyster season in these here parts
ie: Maryland.  It is actually a pleasant experience to camp at Asseteaque
National Seashore (less bugs) and taking the thirty minute trip to
Chincoteaque for a bushel of oysters $30 - $45 to roast and to slurp.
You get to see wild horses and can fish and catch mussels.  I 'll spring
for at least a bushel of oysters even if we choose an alternate spot.  So
if someone wants to organize it or needs assistance, I'm in like Flynn.
