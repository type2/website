&gt;i bought the bus in mid-july for $3,300 (overpaid, i know...i wanted a
bus.).
&gt;body in decent shape, motor rebuilt last october (receipts to prove it).
spent
&gt;$450 on new tires.

sounds like you paid too much for the tires also!!!  I put stock tires from
Goodyear with 5yr/50000 warrenty on for $250, and I overpaid

&gt;mechanic told me today that there is definitely bottom-end rod noise coming
&gt;out of the motor. i called a place in the area that specializes in VWs and
&gt;they gave me a ballpark price of $2,800 to rebuild the motor.

You can buy a completely new motor, heads, pistons, crank, cams, shaft,
valves,...etc for $1150 (what I paid) or less (I am sure someone knows of a
better deal).  Installation is really not that hard, but you should be able
to get it installed for 400-800 from a reputible mechanic (that is what I
was quoted)

&gt;options that have occured to me: 1) see if the PO will give me some money
&gt;back. 2) bail out -- try to sell this one at a significant loss and try a
&gt;different bus. 3) bite the bullet and have the work done.

Unless you have a written warrenty, you have no recourse from the previous
owner.  even with one, you can't hold them to it, depending on the wording.
how much do you want a bus?  I have learned that an older VW is not for
someone that doesn't have time and desire to work on it, or have an open
ended wallet.
