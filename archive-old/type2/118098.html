Subject: Re: [T2] Chrome Bumpers

Hiya Todd,

I'm an early baywindow bus owner so my knowledge of later busses is somewhat 
limited.  But didn't the Champagne Editions sport a set of chromed bumpers?  
They were pretty good looking Busses.  

And........I was looking at a 69 for sale the other day.  Low and behold,  it 
had a set of chromed bumpers.  I can't recall that chromed bumpers were ever 
an option on the 68-72 models, so I'm assuming that these were an &quot;owner 
upgrade&quot;.  Overall they looked pretty good.  However, the white plastic bumper 
shims were still present in the front bumper.  Ick!  I'd lose those.
