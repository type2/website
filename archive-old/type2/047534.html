Subject: Re: [T2] exchanger conversion page

&gt; First of all, the best option for an exhaust on this conversion is actually
&gt; an original-equipment style '72-74 exhaust (unless you are in California
&gt; where a cat converter is required, or still want to use an EGR filter, which
&gt; the '72-74 setup does not provide for).

I'm assuming you're talking about the replacement heat exchangers? The
original 72s had no hookup on the #4 cylinder manifold pipe for an EGR
filter, but the original 73 and 74 heat exchangers did (it took me a
while to figure out what that little tube was for). Another 72 one-year
only thang, for you trivia fans. :-)
