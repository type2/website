&gt; Hey Everyone--
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you to everyone who has responded to my requests the past couple of 
&gt; days--sorry to have so many--I'm just getting ready for the big haul up 
&gt; North--hopefully I will get decent weather. I would like to hear about any 
&gt; ideas to temporarily fix a torn CV boot--all three of the boots are 
&gt; fine--except for one---and I was just curious if anyone had any &quot;Duct Tape&quot; 
&gt; type fixes until I get up North--Thanks for the help---Adam

Well, I have used...  duct tape!

Good stuff, not the cheap stuff.  The boot only had about a 1/2 inch crack
that was weeping grease.

If I had a worse problem than that, I would pull the axle and replace the
boot.  I'd replace both boots, since you can do that and only remove one
CV.
