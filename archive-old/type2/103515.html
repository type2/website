&gt; Is there a trick I can employ the next time I change my '78 Bus' fuel

&gt; and smelly. (Made for interesting conversation at work, tho.)  I'm sure
&gt; the answer is a simple one, but then I'm not very mechanically inclined.

Even if you siphon the tank, there will still be a lot of gas in the fuel
lines.

A valve just before the filter is the best way to keep the gas from coming
out and will make future filter changes easy. I haven't looked but a three
way valve that shut off the tank and connected the other side to a third
drainage hose would be ideal it is existed.

There's no great place to put clamps either because the second clamp really
has no good place to go on the other side of the filter unless you remove
the gas heater take off.

Some gas is always going to come out but you minimize the leakage. Rubber
gloves help a lot. I once watched someone change a filter with a lot of gas
in the tank and no valve. It ran down both his arms and they turned red for
a couple of weeks.
