Subject: Re: [T2] Re:  Sloppy Shifter???

&gt; Some of us girlfriends have successfully pulled, rebuilt and reinstalled
&gt; running engines.

Yah! That would be me, as well. I've done two rebuilds and lots of repairs.
I've taken out and put in engines by myself. That's one of the things I like
about VWs.. the engines are relatively easy to handle and two people of
average strength can pick them up and carry them.
