Subject: Anyone Know

I spoke with a gentleman yesterday that is interested in selling his 71
beetle.  It is in good shape and he wants to know roughly what it is worth.

He is also interested in buying a late model great condition one owner
beetle.  Anybody got one they wanna part with.  Send me the particulars and
a price and we can go from there.  He is serious!
