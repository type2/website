I've been in a general off list discussion about the proper settings for
the hydraulic lifters on my 83 Aircooled 2000 cc TypeIV engine.
Both Bentley and Hayes says to set them at two turns after light contact
with the lifter, other individuals say one and a half turns is
sufficient.
I've gotten extremely good service out of my previous engine using the 2
turn setting and would be interested in hearing from anyone who is using
a different setting and what advantages ther are for using the one and a
half turn setting.
I've currently got the valve setting at 1.5 turns and have only put 90
miles on a new engine, I can't tell any measurable performance or other
difference other than the distributor falls in a slightly different
position with the two turn setting.
Are the valves opening fully at the 1.5 turn setting?
