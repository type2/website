Subject: distributor question

ok, heres the deal.  i have a spare engine for my bus.  its a stock 1600
dual port.  has 34 -3 carb, and the dual vacuum advance distributor.
problem is, the dizzy is shot.  but i have a dizzy from a 70 type 1
autostick, which is dual vacuum advance, and the dizzy from a 67? single
port, which is single vacuum advance.  question is, can i use either of
these on my engine?  i would prefer to use the single advance dizzy if at
all possible.  but any ideas on how the hoses would be hooked up?  do you
use the vacuum port on the side or the front of the carb?  what would you
time the engine to?  

any info is appreciated.
