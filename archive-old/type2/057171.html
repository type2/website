Lyre River Campout Update

Hi Volkswagen Campers,

Here's the final update for camping this weekend on the Olympic
Peninsula (Washington State).

We are receiving quite a bit of late interest, but at this point, have
five confirmed vans with an average of two people per van. (Plus
miscellaneous kids !)

Since we did not receive a sufficient quantity of deposits to make the
$100 group deposit required by the Lyre River Campground, we have
reserved spaces at the immediately adjoining Harrison Beach Campground.
Since the properties adjoin, this should present no problem to accessing
the river or beach.

Mrs. Harrison, owner of the campground has been extremely accomodating
and will do everything in her power to provide camp spots for even late
comers. So, even if you want to come up on short notice, we'll find a
place to park your van, share campsites, etc.

Driving instructions are exactly the same for the Lyre River Campground
except you will watch for a Harrison Beach Sign and turn left about 100
yards before the main entry to Lyre River Campground. If you arrive at
what looks like a ranger station and a stop sign, you have gone too far.
We will also let the Lyre River folks know where we are.

To get to West Lyre River Road, just take hiway 112 West from Port
Angeles 20 miles, through the little town of Joyce, (great general
store) then right on the WEST Lyre River Road. You can reach Port
Angeles from Seattle by taking either the Edmonds/Kingston ferry (my
recommendation) or the Bremerton ferry (a bit longer drive).

Bobbie, Kevin and I plan to leave Seattle around noon on Friday. We will
set up camp and Bobbie will play hostess with vegetarian chili, corn
bread and tossed green salad for arrivals. Be hungry and just bring a
plate. Her chili is great, with about ten varieties of beans. Just look
for our '71 deluxe, White over blue.

Those coming for sure:

Craig Standley                  Seattle
David and Gabrielle Herring     Seattle    *deposit rec'd
Oly Olson &amp; S.O.     Great Falls, MT.  *
Nancy Rosenthal/Harald Rust     Olympia, WA   *
Michael, Bobbie &amp; Kevin Lewis   Seattle, WA

Several others have indicated that they may join us, and are certainly
welcome. We look forward to meeting all and sharing an enjoyable weekend
with VWfolks.

For those who fish, Kevin and I are planning to fish the Elwha on
Saturday morning for trout.

If anyone wishes to call, our number is (206) 932-8824
