Subject: Re: [T2] Morgantown VW Shop (was Re: [T2] Redux boxes value?)

Yep on 51 or 52 or whatever the old 4 lane up into the southeast side of Pittsburg is from Uniontown.  He was more of a rabbit guy, and perhaps also a home appliance repair guy, or that is what it became.  He has been gone for well over 10 years, even as an appliance place, just a falling over shed the last time I saw.

&gt; Speaking of VW places being auctioned: Does anyone know anything about the
&gt; VW place just outside of Morgantown, WV on Route 119 (just before you hit
&gt; Point Marion, PA)?


also wasn't there a place near Uniontown PA on the old route to
Pittsburgh?? I bought some cables from the guy, said he had several
construction trailers full of cables for VW....??
