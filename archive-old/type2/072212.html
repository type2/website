Cc: type2_at_type2_dot_com

You want that extra momentum from the heavy flywheel to help carry you up
the hills.  With a light flywheel, your engine will slow down quicker.  A
light flywheel is for quick engine RPM's such as for street racing or
dunebuggies where you &quot;snap&quot; the gas pedal and jump around corners.


&gt;say if a person with a type I- powered bus lived in a very hilly area like
&gt;the ozarks or cascades and did most of their driving there...wouldn't it be
&gt;a benefit to use a 12.5# flywheel with a counterweighted crank?  i realize
&gt;the stock flywheel would be better for long flat hauls....where i live,
&gt;there is like five 30 degree hills every mile....
