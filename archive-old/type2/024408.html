Subject: Battery drain problem

I Hope someone can give me some advice regarding a problem I have encountered.

I have just purchased a 73' LHD Westfalia (my first ever bus), I have spent some
 money on getting it
through an MOT, as it had been stood for a while!

Once I had the MOT I got the bus insured and proceeded to take it out and about
locally to get used
 to its driving character. All was well until the next time I went to used the
bus the NEW battery
was flat.

It had been stood for a week, during which time the battery had drained. Having
re-charged the battery I have measured 210mA draining
from the battery when parked up, and all fuses removed.

You will have to excuse my ignorance but this is all new to me.

My only clue so far is the noise of a relay behind the passenger seat, where the
 fridge is fitted,
when I connect the battery.

I do not know if this means anything, reading through your archives and library
I think I have read
that this relay is to connect the aux. battery to the fridge at some stage. I
have also read that a
fridge draws 200+ mA.

So I guess me question is am I looking at a faulty relay, fridge or something
else.

Thanks in advance for any advice received.

Andrew
