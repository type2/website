Subject: Re: [T2] painting question

I knew we could iron this out---
Start small--then get bigger and better stuff.
If you don't like it from the get go--bail---

This is all a good idea---

It end result can be very rewarding, and make you feel good about what
you have accomplished.

Have Fun in whatever you decide--

Later,

Terry

=A0=A0=A0=A0I think you are right. Practice would be good. The two old
beater trucks would do nicely, for starters. 
=A0=A0=A0=A0As for liking this, well.. I didn't really expect to enjoy
painting cars.. although, you never know. If anything is to enjoy, it is
a good result, and early success can help to ensure many more repeats.
So, it is not a waste to invest in something good if one has the
determination to follow through and use it. I feel a lot more free about
small investments now.. so easy to sell your &quot;mistakes&quot; on eBay! If I
bought a nice system and decided that I absolutely hated painting,
someone would be happy to take my &quot;buyer's goof&quot; off my hands for a
reasonable price, at least after a few tries.. I wouldn't lose all. Jan
