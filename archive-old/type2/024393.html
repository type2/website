Hi all

On a 76 2000ccF.I.
Has anyone ever really understood the effectiveness of the &quot;intake air 
preheating hose &quot; which goes through the tin and sucks dusty, cruddy air from 
below the engine compartment, right where the back wheels kick up all the 
dirt.
Can this outside air duct be disconnected without ill effects and let the 
inside engine compartment air be the sole intake source? 
What about that little thermostatic valve, is it necessary in other than 
freezing temps?
Have any of you folks who off-road in dusty conditions a lot, or dealt with 
volcanic ashes ever experimented with an oil immersion filtering setup?
Pantyhose can't be the only answer.
Please share inventive ideas.
TIA
Bucket
