I had a similar problem with my 79. My problem was a worn area on the
AFM contact strip. When the flap in the afm was open to a certain
point it would loose contact and buck. I checked this by looking at
the contact track in the afm. My afm already had been monkeyed with
before I got it so the cover was not sealed. If your cover is sealed
and you don't feel good removing it, break out the bentley. there are
at least two pins on the afm that you can read resistance for this
contact with. Move the flapper with a pencil and look for a break at
any point in the movement. HTH.
