Subject: Evaporative Emissions Canister

I have a 1970 bus. In the upper right corner of the engine compartment is the 
canister to absorb fuel vapors from the gasoline tank vent. It kind of looks 
like a small old-fashioned muffler. It has three pipes coming out of it. All 
the hoses were gone when I got my bus (it wasn't running) and I don't know 
where the hoses for this canister are supposed to run. I haven't found a 
clear picture in Haynes or Bentley. Can someone help me? I assume that the 
small opening in the front of the canister goes to the vent from the fuel 
tank. There is a large opening next to it. That seems like it should have a 
hose from the cooling fan housing to this opening. The opening on the back of 
the canister seems right to go to one of the openings of the air cleaner. If 
someone can, please confirm or correct my analysis. I also wonder if this 
canister is available. I ran the part number on it (a 113 series number) 
through Bus Depot's web site search and it said not available. The old one 
looks clean and intact.
Thanks again for the help, &quot;Erfolkswagen&quot; now has 6000 miles on it and doing 
OK. I have a lot to do yet. By the way, I have about $3500 invested in parts 
and vehicle. I noticed the discussion about costs for a reliable vehicle and 
will probably end up close to figure quoted by the time everything is about 
right.
TIA
Dana
