Hi all,

Since aquiring my &quot;new&quot; Westy 2 weeks ago, I've been working my
fingers to the bone on my bus.  Things completed: new front wheel
bearings, brake pads, fuel lines, spark plugs &amp; wires.  Replaced the dash
bulb for the oil pressure switch.  I spent alot of time on the body.  The
paint was badly oxidized, used 3M''s Cleaner/Wax, amazing stuff.  I did
make a temporary repair to the the small amount of rust under windshield
and left jelousy window.  It looks much better without the &quot;trails&quot; of rust
running down the sides/front of the bus.  I attempted to pound out the
rear bumper, but gave up and ordered a new one.  Repainted the rims
and front bumper white.  They look great.  

Here's a tip for anyone wanting to refinish their rims but don't want to go
to the trouble of removing the tires.  (I'm sure I'm not the first person to do
this, but I've never seen anyone suggest it before.)  Use a wire brush on
your power drill to sand the rim, be careful of the valve stem.  Spread
Go-Jo hand cleaner or other similar product on the tire.  make sure you
get the stuff right up to the rim and over the entire surfice of the tire.  Also
cover the valve stem with the stuff.  The idea is that paint won't stick to it,
so put it where ever you don't want the paint to go.  It is much faster than
attempting to tape off the tire, which I can never get the tape to stick to. 
Then just prime and paint, wipe off the Go-Jo.  The Go-Jo contains lanalin
which is great for your tires, they will look fantastic!

The point of all this work was to get the bus ready for my family reunion
on Easter Sunday.  It was a 400 mile trip, each way.  I left Saturday at
noon, after frantically reinstalling the freshly washed an dyed curtains.  I
decided to take secondary roads most of the way so that I could drive at
a more leasurely pace.  The bus never missed a beat.  It was raining most
of way.  Heat was great except that the vent wouldn't close (gotta look at
that).  The relatives loved the bus, it was a hit.  On the way back I a made
a last minute decision to take the interstate. I90 to 35W, I was a little
nervous, but the bus ran awesome.  65-70mph for 6 hours straignt, 2 gas
stops and several bathroom breaks.  Oil usage: 0, average MPG: 21.2
(had a slight tailwind on the return trip).

It took awhile to get used to driving a bus again.  I've been drive a
beautiful '90 Volvo 740 GL for 3 years.  I got kinda spoiled :)  I don't know
if people passing me noticed the huge grin on my face !!!

Thanks for listening.....
