Subject: Metal prep question

Hey volks, over the past week I have been trying to get the cooling tin from my 72's enginge ready to paint. I sandblasted the tin to remove old paint and hand sanded it to a smooth semi-shiny surface. Then I proceeded to treat it with DuPont Kwik Prep (the blue stuff). I soaked a sponge and wiped all the pieces as per the directions on the jug and left it to dry. When I returned, all of the pieces i treated had  what looked life surface rust instead of the dull bluish tint i expected to see. WTF!!! I thought this stuff was supposed to kill any rust present and prevent any new rust from forming. 
Like I said before, the sponge was really soaked. There was metal prep dripping off of the tin pieces when I was finished. Did i put too much on and the water in it allowed the rust before the chemical reaction could happen?
I am fairly certain that I don't want to try to paint over what looks like rust. If I sand the suspected rust down do I need to treat the metal again?

TIA
Mike
