&lt;&lt;  Sorry to be so on about torque but I used to work in a shop and had
a coworker who was impact wrench happy and it used to really piss me off to
hear that damn thing all day....

P.S. In retrospect now that I have a desk job I sort of miss that sound....
 &gt;&gt;

Pulled the engine out of a Bus some years ago to find the bolts holding the
flywheel on (2L) quite neatly rounded...More impact wrench destruction?
Luckily, I've got a set of &quot;salvage sockets&quot;, but the bolts were goners af-
ter removal... ;-(
