Subject: RE: Berg Temp Dipstick

Go to http://www.geneberg_dot_com/
  Click on &quot;Parts and Accessories on the left side of the page.  Then select
&quot;Oiling System&quot;.

  Scroll down till you see part # GB 227 &quot; temperature dipstick.  No picture
unfortunately, but there is a good description.

  I don't know how one would obtain Berg's products locally in South Africa,
but emailing them would probably yield a solution to that problem.

  Oil Temperature sender and Instrument

  (Cylinder head temperature sender and Instrument)

  Dear Friends,

  Would it be possible, if you so please, to send me an address where I
might see the device (berg) you are discussing? Or could you give me some
more info to help me trying to find such goods here, in South Africa?

  I must admit, i rather fancy the idea of crossing our Kalahari  and Karoo
deserts with precise instuments and being in control as opposed to &quot;living
on a prayer&quot; and, as so often happens, buggered bearings and shot rings...

  Many thanks and greetings from MikeBee, mtvideo_at_global.co.za, ZA
