Subject: A funny thing happened on my way to the forum...

On the way back from the post office this evening the clutch cable snapped
somewhere in the middle of its run.

Thanks to the sage counsel on this list, I didn't panic, even though I
didn't have a spare on board (yes, I know, foolish; but due to lack of
finances, not lack of foresight).

I learned a few interesting things:

1. Whoever told me that someone managed to tie a rope to the clutch lever
and operate it through the driver's window was either mistaken, or forgot to
tell me that the driver was a gorilla in the prime of it's life and health.

2. It's metric, old boy.  Next time remember that and you won't have to bang
that 1/2&quot; socket off of a 13mm bolt head...

2. It is possible to push start a bus by yourself while it's in 3rd gear,
the key is on, and you're pushing from the open driver's door.  Not safe by
any means, but it did work.

3. God was watching over us and had us break down exactly where we could get
back into traffic after getting the bus started (on a convenient slope),
(legally) loop in a parking lot to bypass a traffic light that refused to
cooperate, and stay running until we got into the driveway.

4. Never leave the Muir book home...

5. Be thankful that Darrell's shop (and that new clutch cable) is within
walking distance of my house.

6. I love my bus. :O)
