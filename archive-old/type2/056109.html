you might've just popped a spark plug.  I was on further tour and i saw a bus
pulled over to the side of the highway onramp...he said that there was a loud
knocking noise and he thought he had a bent rod and blew a cylinder.  After
looking in the engine compartment we found that the spark plug had just popped
out and he was on the road again in no time!
good luck
let us know how things go.
peace
dave
