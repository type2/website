Subject: Re: [T2] 80-83 Vanagon site search

Thanks for the offer Brian,
Can you take a look under the drivers side where the heat exchanger connects 
to the accordian shaped tube and see if the tube has an angled or straight 
inlet. I removed these tubes after I removed the engine and cant remember 
wich end connects to the exchanger. You may be able to see it by looking 
above the tire into the wheel well.

Can you also take a look at the decel valve and see which way it's oriented? 
Does the small vacuum niple point toward the driver or passenger side?

Thanks
Tom
