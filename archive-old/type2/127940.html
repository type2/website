Subject: light switches

I have both a '69 and '71 Westfalia.  On the '69 the switch that turns on the interior lights is on the left of the steering column. The switch for the headlights is on the right. On the '71 they are just the opposite. Is one correct and the other a leftover from someone's rewiring?  Are both right?  Just curious.
