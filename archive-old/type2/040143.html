I second what Steve Howell wrote.  

Not that I don't like Dawn as a person, I do, well at least I did until 
recently, but we made a trade deal in which various things changed hands 
except that I was supposed to get a westy what not cabinet.  That was last 
summer, shortly before she went to Arizona, and it was between myself and 
Dawn&amp;Steve (her husband at the time) so I figgered the deal was with both of 
them and he isn't really a bus head like she is, said he'd pay for it if I 
found one, but I had only made the deal cause she said she was always finding 
westy stuff as she was making westy canvas stuff,  which they knew, and 
anyway when I talked to her about it she blew me off.   You'ld think that 
moving and personal stuff can take a lot of time, but she'd try to make this 
stuff right.   Richard looked like he had heard the same song before.   
bottom line- I got the short end of the deal.  The  burnt hand remembers the 
fire.

&lt;&lt; AFFECTED???  She, it or whatever....RIPPED OFF several of my good friends.
 she took their mone and never gave em the time of day when the approached
 her personnally at later Bus events.  Not even so much as an apology and
 attempt to make things right.  If she has your money and her business
 happens to get &quot;affected&quot; again......
 later
