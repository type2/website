...I think the wiring was maybe just barely adequate in the first place,
even when brand new. Of course corrosion can and does take it's toll and
changes are possible in ALL substances that can make them more or less
conducive.

Jaime Chriswisser did write me to remind that the fix for this is
generally to install the Bosch starter relay which &quot;takes the meager
voltage from the ignition and the relay switches to battery current and
activates the starter&quot;. Prob a better solution than rewiring. Thanks
Jaime!
