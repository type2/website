Subject: Re: Dead Stickers: Probable Cause?

        I hope a court wouldn't take GD stickers as 'probable cause'.
OTOH, the anti-drunk-driving campaign out here in the Bay Area has a
nice sticker based on the number of law enforcement groups around the
Bay, sticker reads &quot;AVOID THE 13&quot; with a skull &amp; 7 star badge... pretty
cool. The official attitude is drink what you want, but don't be caught
driving if you're impaired. Hard to argue with that. When I have a rear
bumper installed, I plan to post one of those stickers, along with
&quot;Practice Random Acts Of Kindness And Sensless Acts Of Beauty&quot; &amp; the
expected Mermen/KFJC/etc stickers.
        Favorite humorous sticker: &quot;Question Reality&quot;
        Favorite 'attitude' sticker: &quot;Don't Mess With Texas&quot; (Anti littering...)

        Bill
