Subject: cv boots and fi parts

Hi all,
I had all my CV boots replaced with parts from RMMW and after a month of 30
mile round trip drives to work and some misc. other weekend driving 1 boot
is totally ripped/shrunken and another shows very serious signs of
dis-integration also.  I have seen posts this year about this,  but I guess
it would never happen to me.  Is this a game of russian roulette??
Also,
I have been stripping all the FI stuff off of this 2.0 79 engine I am
putting in my '72, and I really don't have a place to &quot;get rid&quot; of this
stuff.  Would anyone on the list be interested in any of this stuff?  Give
me what you think it's worth to you (pieces or whole) and pay shipping and
I'd gladly see it all go to a good home or spare parts bin.   It all worked
(?) I'm told by PO but I can't gaurantee anything so judge accordingly. 
Otherwise this stuff is going to rot in my barn.
Hey, thanks, 
Mark
