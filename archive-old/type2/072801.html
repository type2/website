I used this exact setup a few years back to tow my 79 westy from San
Francisco to Indiana.  I used a Ryder truck with a 2 wheel tow-dolley.  I
hadn't owned a bus before at the time and did not know whether there was
enough lubrication in the tranny without the engine running to have the
rear wheels on the ground during the tow.  As a matter of fact I still
don't, though I suspect there probably is.

Anyway, I put the rear wheels on the dolley and tied the steering wheel
tightly to prevent the wheels from turning (front end was pretty tight).
If I were to do it again, I'd probably try to use a larger trailer and get
all four wheels off the ground (Ryder recommended against it at the time
saying that such a rig would be blown over by high winds in the mountains
which I now think was BS).  I did have a bit of trouble with fishtailing at
speeds over 70 mph when you hit the ruts left in the pavements by the
semis.

Then again, if I were to do it all again, I would've just driven the damn
thing back, but that's another story.
