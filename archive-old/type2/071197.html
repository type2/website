Subject: carb questions on a 73
Message-ID: &lt;c649b22a.2462ff6c_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

I have the option of purchasing a complete set of used but running ( I know 
the guy and saw them on his bus), solex dual 32's.  with manifolds, linkage, 
air filter setup.  for $65.  Sounds reasonable doesn't it??  Any opinions 
what these are worth??  I would like to have a fresh set around that are 
rebuilt ready to go.

2nd question...i was doing a valve adjust.  and was checking some things on 
the motor.  popped of the air cleaner stuff, checked the choke and noticed 
one of my accelerator pump nozzles was gone,( the one that curves and points 
straight down into the carb.) so now when i step on the gas all the accel. 
pump does it gurgle up a stream of gas instead of shooting it down into the 
carb.  obviously i need to replace it.  i have no found anywhere to find a 
replacement one so far.  any suggestions??  and also i wonder where it went 
and if it did any damage??  i have not noticed any change in performance.  

i welcome all opinions ..........thanks
