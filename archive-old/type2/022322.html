============================&gt;
If you don't have free turning wheels when you jack her up so you can 
spin the wheels by hand, you have drag somewhere. (duh!?)

OK
If you can't turn the stars, pull the hubs, and then you will have 
better visibility and access. After the brakes are adjusted properly, 
try applying the brakes a few times.

If the brakes seem to stick after you apply the brakes a few times, go 
up front and look at the master cylinder. Make sure the plunger is set 
so that the pressure can relieve fully. There should be &quot;free play&quot; 
there. If not, your brakes will build up pressure each time they are 
applied, and the pressure will not fully relieve for a prolonged amount 
of time.......... hence -&gt; drag !

PS
While you got those hubs off, remove all grease from the bearings, 
check the wheel bearings, re-grease, and you should be bearing grease 
happy for another 30,000 miles.
