&gt; I have the chance to buy a 71 transporter with a brand new 1400 engine for
&gt; $3500. This bus is in great condition. However what I really need is a
&gt; pop-top.. would it be crazy to take the pop-top of my 74 westy and put it
on
&gt; the 71 transporter... would I be breaking the law?

1400 engine????  Stock it came with a 1600.  For $3500 you can find a good
condition  pop top Westy.  Just keep looking.

As for taking the poptop off a 74. This involves a great deal of work and
unless you are a skilled welder, a lot of money.  As you will have to cut
the roof way back and cut the supports, thus weakening your bus.  Then
figure out a way to restrengthen your bus.
