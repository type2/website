Subject: Starter bushing in tranny?

Hello, hello hello.

      1981 VANAGON MANUAL TRANS

I seemed to have misplaced the starter bushing. Yikes! I didn't even know
there was one until the  FLAPS rep asked me if I had one.  I aware of things
that fall from overhead and I'm pretty sure I'd have se3en or heard bushing
drop. I did a thoruogh sweep of the ground...nothing.

The archives hinted at the idea of the piece falling down in between the
flywheel, etc.  Is that possible?  I don't know.

The shaft of my starter has a collar that is 'circlipped' into the groove of
the  shaft.  The hole in the tranny case is the same size as the shaft. Can
someone please fill in the picture for me?

Also, I'm curious and suspiciuos   of the work that was done to this unit
when I took it to the Starter/Alternar Only Market. I fully expected the
re-worked unit to start when I put it in, but it sounded and seemed like it
was still doing the same thing. UUUUmmmm......

Any similiar experiences or insight is much appreciated.

Thanks
Craig
