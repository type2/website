&gt; For you folks out where they have these places, how much does it cost?
&gt;
&gt; For instance, If I wanted to go out and pull an alternator off of a T4
&gt; engine, would they quote a price before I pulled it? or just when I got
&gt; ready to leave?

well the local guy has a pricee sheet, lists all the commmon parts and the
cost,.....ie  alt: -  $20

that's any alt any car good bad etc.  he even has a sign, you chose
it, you pick it,, you leave it's yours, don't bring it back.....!
usually they charge a nominal fee just to go in, the local place it is $1
and you sign a release.

I've brought out a bucket full of little things, plus some big parts they
charged for the big stuff  and $2 for the bucket of parts.....

each place is a little different
