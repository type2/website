Why look now we're besieged by Parts Place commercial adds as well,
and we all know how well we love them.  Duh, scuse me I need to return
this cause you screwed it up for the 4th time, and uh gee whiz glad you
took me for $200 more on that piece of crap Dansk exhaust system for
the Wasserboxer than anyone else would have, plus sent me regular bug
gaskets even when I particularly mentioned I wanted only REAL vanagon
gaskets.  Claim to be &quot;vanagon syncro specialists&quot; in the new add.

Course flaming aside, I've been ordering from em for 10+ years, and
have been reasonably happy except for the Dansk pipes.  Saved me loads
on a Quantum Syncro muffler and a Wasserboxer PS pump over the years,
as well as many other things, but I'd enjoy good comments without the
plug for the company every time.  New catalog is pretty good as well.
And at least they got a catalog.

One mans opinion.  (albeit a usually bitter man)
