Subject: Re: [T2] RPM Question

&gt;I know that on my non-VW vehicle. I need to
&gt;be in excess of 80mph before I even hit 3000 rpms. Any thoughts? Any I
&gt;potentially causing any harm at such a high rpm?

I would hazard to guess that your non VW vehicle has a large displacement 
motor. Which means it makes the 60 HP required to go 65 mph at much lower 
RPMs than our smallish engines.
