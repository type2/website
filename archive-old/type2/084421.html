Subject: Re: [T2] heat exchanger &quot;rebuilding&quot;

&lt;&lt; Does anybody have any knoledge of or experience with 
those high temp ceramic exhasut coatings. Would that be 
safe to use on heat exchangers? Also, wouldn't some sort 
of coating such as cermaic of Por-15 make it &quot;safer&quot; to 
use the fiberglass wrap?
The guy that did the Rust, noise and heat website swore 
by the wrap, wonder how the boxes on that bus are 
holding up.
-- &gt;&gt;

Results from another list:
The ceramic coatings are better than the wrap. The wrap
caused (on H2O engines, at least) severe metal failure -
the cast manifolds cracked after one year. OTOH, the
quality on the ceramic coatings varied from source to
source. Some coat individually, some batch coat...Try
and get references before choosing a coater...
