Subject: nose panel and front bumper for 72?
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hi Volks,

As you may remember, i bought a 72 factory highroof
panel van for about $60 (no typo) in December.  Last
weekend i checked it out and was surprised to find it
in reasonable condition!  Apart from rockers and rear
wheelarchs, all it seems to need is a nose panel and
front bumper -- its own ones are severely dented.

I checked the biggest German parts vendor's catalog
(Schmidt-Lorenz from Hamburg) and found both items to
be NLA.  There are patch panels available for the
lower nose though -- maybe the rest can be hammered
into shape.  On Bus Depot's web site i found an item
&quot;nose, 68-79 bus&quot;, part no. 211 805 035H, which i
assume to be the later style, and the lower section
for the early style as in the German catalog.

But before i do that, or even sacrifice my 71 nose clip
(which is reserved for a really Good Bus (tm) and not
for this highroof that shall be a daily driver), i'd
like to ask you US guys whether you know of a source 
for replacement nose panels and front bumpers for pre-72s.
Of the bumper i only need the center section (logically,
as the end sections are still listed :-).

Replacing the nose with parts for post-72 buses is not 
an option for me -- i have seen too many of those poor 
bastard buses lately.

TIA!

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
