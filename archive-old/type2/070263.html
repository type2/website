Subject: Bus hunting

Monday I got a tip on a bus for sale in the area.  Early baywindow was
all they knew.  Some body damage but a running engine.  The kid who 
owned it had been through four clutches recently and mom and dad were 
tired of paying for the repairs.  That is about all I knew.

So, Tuesday I enquired some more and got a phone number and an 
address.  They were home so I went for a look.  Turns out the bus is a
'71!  Joy of joys.  Not so fast.  Body damage first.  Front left had 
taken a major hit.  Headlight displaced.  Left door did not open and 
was held closed by a bungie.  Right rear had a dent like something big 
and blunt had backed into it.  Left rear had been driven too close to 
a post or something.  Rust was typical for Nebraska.  Rockers were 
gone, battery tray was going.  Rust creaping up fast everywhere else.

It looked like the bus had once been a parts bus and then was 
converted to a driver.  The front turn signal indicators were gone.  
The outside rear marker lights were gone.  The poptop was gone and the
hole was replaced with a piece of plexiglass.  The sealing job was on
its way out.  One of the screens was gone and the other was torn to 
shreads.  Gas cap was a rag!

The mechanicals were similar.  Records show a new engine, rebuilt and 
installed by a shop I trust, was installed 4 years ago.  It now has 
28K.  Bottom side of engine was soaked.  No thermostat.  Air cleaner 
sitting in there like they had been trying to unhook it.  Engine hatch
did not close well because the latch had been hit at some point.  
Tranny was a junkyard unit with about one year of use.  Kid who owned 
it said he didn't really think the clutch was gone but rather the 
gudgeon (sp) pin.  I didn't really spend too much time trying to 
diagnose.

Interior had a custom divider installed behind the front seats that 
still allowed walkthrough.  These had headrest things installed on 
them.  Nice idea but they were mounted so poorly that I doubt they 
would perform the function of a headrest in a crash.  Sink/ice box 
unit was gone.  The rest of the interior, while dirty, did have some 
promise.  It did have both(!) of the cranks for the jalousey windows.

Brakes, by confession of the owner, were sketchy.  A quick glance 
showed no fluid in the tank.  This could be the problem with the 
sketchyness.  Tires were newer but not reinforced.  The only upside 
of the whole mess was the roof rack.  Any ideas as to the value of 
this?  (see related post)

I had heard that this bus might be had for as little as $100.  This 
from the guy who had been working on it until it's most recent demise.
The asking price?  $1,000.  I tried not to laugh.  I offered $100.  He
mentioned that he was thinking of parting it out but wasn't sure how 
to go about that.  I might have been interested in the engine until I 
saw the lack of a thermostat and it's general condition.  As it stands
I want the rack and those window cranks.  I told him I would get back 
to him in a week.  I also think I will talk to mom or dad as they are 
more interested in getting rid of it.  This bus was a genuine eyesore 
in their part of town.  As they say, better luck next time.
