Don't know what year you have and that may make a difference from looking at
the electrical schematics for different years. Basically the same but maybe
an extra wire...

&lt;SNIP&gt;
&gt;have to big wires coming out of the alternator. One is the big red one that
&gt;goes to the starter solenoid and the other one is just a hose that has 4
&gt;cables in it. Three of the these cables (red, brown and green) end into a
&gt;black plug with T shape

Voltage Regulator... only plugs in one way... should be at upper-front-right
of engine compartment (at least in 79).

&gt;...also there's coming a short blue cable out of the
&gt;black plug that has a transparent plug at the end.

goes to the alt 'idiot light' in the dash. There should be a connector
coming out of the wiring harness that passes through the bulkhead of the
engine compartment this plugs into.

&gt;...There's one black cable left that has a transparent plug too, but it's
not conected to the black
&gt;plug.

Don't know about this one???

&gt;Where do i have to conect all of these cables? Which one is the cable
&gt;that goes to the control light in the dash?
&gt;        Thanxs beforhand for your help guy's...
