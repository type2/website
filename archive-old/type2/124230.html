Subject: Chemicals ok to use on fiberglass

Hey,
The inside of my poptop on my 76 westy has become virtual mold colony.  All I
could gather from the archives is that this is a common probelm.
http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/type2/055776.html
Anyone have any recommendations on cleansers that are ok to use on the inside
of the top?  Some common products come to mind, bleach, Tilex, etc. but I
don't know what might be harmful to the top.  Most products I've seen geared
toward this application seem to for the outside.
Thanks,
Mike
