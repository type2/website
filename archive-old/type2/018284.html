&gt;     Hi All,
&gt;
&gt; My local FLAPS has been a tremendous help over the past year and a half [...]

&gt; So yesterday I call them up and ask them for a price check for the five major
&gt; door seals [...]

&gt;  She called back and left a message.  I nearly fell on my _at_ss - with tax,
&gt; $600.00!!!! (That's in Canadian Funds).

&gt; Can anyone suggest a less expensive source for these seals? -

Mark,

I just got an entire set of every piece of rubber needed for my double cab from
Bus Depot.  I priced out WCM and was expecting to pay almost $800 for all that
stuff.  Bus Depot came through for about $375 US (including shipping)
