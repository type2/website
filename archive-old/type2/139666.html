courtney,

if you have a bad throttle shaft bushing on the carb, a rebuild will not 
cure it.  That's almost what it sounds like to me (despite the fact that 
your idle is fine).  This can sometimes be cured by RTV'ing the crap out 
of the bushing, although I haven't had much luck doing that in the past.

If it helps make you feel any better, I've had similar problems and 
frustrations myself.

do you have a spare carb you can swap onto it to check?
