Subject: Used motor startup

	I thought I would let the folks on the list here know how the 
engine install on my 72 Westie is going.  Like several other folks I 
had recently offered the machine up for sale on the list.  No takers. 
It seems to me that the list is not a predatory lot at all.  No one 
out there to take advantage of us during our weak moments.
	I had found a used motor.  It looks like it is a 1700 from an 
early '73.  It is complete, but has a Weber progressive.  The 
manifold boots were all shot, so I replaced those.  The pressure 
plate and clutch were a mess, so that came off.  Changed the oil and 
put a new filter on. The distributor cap and rotor are brand new. 
So my buddy and I decide to put it in and start it up.  See what 
happens.
	Well we wrestle around for most of the night.  Sure is 
different from a beetle.  We get it in, but he has to split and I 
have to deal with it the next day.  Next day I hook up the battery 
and see if it turns over. Turns over good.  Then I hook up the coil, 
put the fuel line in a jar of gas and crank. Nuttin.  The fuel pump 
is not pulling gas.  So I prime the carb.  Dump a little gas down 
there.  Crank.  Vrooom. Then stop.  Still no gas in the filter.  I 
force a little gas down the fuel line and try it again.  Vrooom . 
And it keeps going!  Are these mechanical fuel pumps that weak?
	Well I let the beast run for about 30 seconds and shut it 
down. Let it cool.  Everything sounds good, no knocks pings or 
backfires.  The engine is racing a bit and I hear this weird squeal. 
As it turns out I had not tightened one of the clamps on the manifold 
boots.  After I do this the squeal is gone and the r.p.m.s at idle 
are a lot lower.  The engine really seems to run nice.  The oil 
pressure light goes out fast and stays off.  No flicker at idle.  It 
also takes about 10 seconds for it to come back on after I shut the 
motor off.  The muffler is half gone, so it is a bit loud.  It also 
is running pretty rich right now.  It also seems to have one push rod 
tube with a hole in it.  No other oil leaks though.  All I have to do 
is just touch the starter and she's up and running.
	So after we determined that the motor runs, we decide to go 
ahead and use it. Before we pull the motor out my buddy and I decide 
to go ahead and check the compression.  Well I didn't want to do it, 
but he convinced me.  I didn't want bad news.  I check the 
compression, all plugs out and the motor slightly warm.  All 
cylinders at 100lb almost exactly.  Did that on Sunday night.  This 
morning I realize that I only propped open the choke and not the 
throttle plate!  Too late to redo since  we already pulled the motor. 
I'm thinking, though, that this motor might work out.
	So I have a bunch of slightly used parts for my motor.  I'm 
going to put on new plug wires (already have new plugs), manifold 
gaskets, better tin, better flywheel and clutch.  Since I'm there 
perhaps I should install new front (FIF) oil seal?  Rear oil seal? 
I'm kind of a &quot;If it ain't broke don't fix it&quot; guy, but?  opinions.
	So what it looks like it someone bought a remaned engine from 
VW  Canada and put all the old crap from the previous engine on it. 
I think the melted pressure plate must have been the last straw. 
Once I get things together the bus should roll.  So any other things 
I should take care of?  Probably new CV boots and greased CVs (couple 
rotten boots)?  The objective is to move.
