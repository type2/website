Subject: Grinding into first

List,
I am having a difficult time with the transmission in
my '72.  When I shift into first from a stop, it
grinds.  I can downshift into first when moving
forward slightly without any difficulty or grinding. 
Also, when downshifting to second, it doesn't always
want to shift very easilty, it takes more force than I
want to give it to move the shifter into second gear. 
I was reading Muir last night and he spoke of moans
and growls, I am assuming my grinding is related.  I
haven't yet checked the transmission oil level, I plan
on doing that tonight.  My question, if the level is
low, would that produce my sypmtoms, or am I looking
at a bigger problem inside the transmission?  I am
preparing myself for the worst.  If it is determined
that the transmission needs to be overhauled, how easy
is it to find a used or rebuilt tranny?  I would
likely opt not to have the current transmission
rebuilt and instead would look to replace.  Thanks in
advance, happy Friday...
