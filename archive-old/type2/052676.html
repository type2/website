Subject: [T2] Fixed 1978 horn problem; now clutch &quot;growls&quot; on release??.

Ahh, I see that my 221,000 mi Westy is finally showing its age......
    When I posted about horn blowing when turning the steering wheel
(after catching the seat belt in the groove under the st. wheel), I
assumed it had a horn ground wire going thru the center column like my
old 71 bus, but instead, upon pulling the wheel, I see it has a ring
under the wheel that rubs a contact connected to ground- and the belt
crumpled up the contact.  I straightened it out, but there was a stress
crack in the rivet holding the contact (a curved copper plate about 1/4&quot;
wide and bent up in the center to form a &quot;spring&quot;.)  It had worn a nice
hole in the center where the wheel ring rubs it.   
  Checked my spare steering column and realized you gotta remove too
much stuff and replace the entire signal assembly, so I decided to get
out the minitorch and put solder over the crack, and cut a small piece
of copper sheeting out and soldered it over the hole so IT would take
the friction.
   Worked fine, but upon driving to test it, the clutch at first acted
like it wasn't clutching, so suspecting a stuck needle bearing or
pressure plate, (happened 50,000 mi ago in the WET northwest)-I put it
in gear and then started it- did break free and declutched OK, but upon
letting out the clutch, there is now a &quot;grinding&quot; or &quot;rubbing&quot; whine
which stops when it's all the way out- NEVER heard this before, but
having been getting chatter at times.  It is not the throwout bearing,
(quiet when pedal fully down) &amp; can clutch in and out fine when in
neutral.
Any idea what this could be-could the needle bearing be gone and the
plate wobbling about or something else?
