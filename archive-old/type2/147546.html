Hmmm...I wonder if you could pick up a small round plastic ash tray
somewhere that would sit inside one of the cup holders. Then you'd still
have one cup holder and the storage pouch left over after using the other
cup holder for the ash tray.



Actually, that just might work.  Before I gave up that nasty habit, I had an 
ash tray that fit a cup holder in my Honda Civc.  
 
I ordered one. Definitely looks handy, but will have to see how it affects 
the view of the gauges I have above the ashtray and stereo access.
