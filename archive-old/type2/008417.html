&gt;   I personally like to try to follow the philosophy taught by Yocho
&gt;Yamamoto, a Samurai and Zen master from, if I remember correctly, the
&gt;16th Century. He said: &quot;Each day when you wake up, look in the mirror,
&gt;and say to yourself, 'Today is a good day to die.'&quot;, and always be
&gt;prepared to do so. And when you face your enemy, say it again, 'Today is
&gt;a good day to die.', and don't worry about preserving your life, for
&gt;your life is only a tiny brief second compared to eternity, so what
&gt;difference does it make if it is a little shorter?&quot;
&gt;   
&gt;    Later, one of the greatest of our Native spiritual leaders Crazy
&gt;Horse, taught essentially the same thing -- he taught his people the war
&gt;cry &quot;Hoka hey&quot;, which means &quot;Today is a good day to die.&quot;
&gt;    

Personally, I'm fond of George Patton's quote:

&quot;Nobody ever won a war by dying for his country; you win wars by making 
the other poor sonofabitch die for HIS country!&quot;
