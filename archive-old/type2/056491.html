Hi Volks,
          I just went looking for some information on www.type2_dot_com and I'm getting a DNS lookup error. Is this my problem (in which case would someone P-mail me the IP address) or has it gone away? If so is it a temporary lapse?

 I would like to post some questions to the vanagon list, but I don't subscribe (I read occasionally from the web). Does anyone know of a web-based interface to the vanagon lists? Will I need to route a post through a listmaster anyway? If I were to subscribe and unsub. to allow a post to be authorised, does anyone know how I would need to synchronise the postings (ie how long it takes to be registered as a subsciber)?

Thanks a lot- sorry for the wasted bandwidth/reader time.

Cheers,
        W.
