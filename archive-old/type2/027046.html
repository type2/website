Subject: auto tranny

Hi again everyone.  A couple months ago I was looking for an automatic 
transmission to replace my broken one.  I had some pretty good luck getting 
in touch with someone close to me but I ended up loosing his phone numbers 
and any other way to contact him.  I am in the minneapolis area and need a 
replacement automatic transmission for a 1975 bus.  I would like to replace 
it with one that does NOT have the vaccum hose.  I think it needs to be from 
76 to 79.  I got in touch with this guy through a person on the list 
(Justin).  Anyway, if anyone is out there that could help, let me know.  
Thanks.

Adam
Orange 1975 westy
