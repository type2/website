&gt;can be solved by applying a bead of high temp silicone (permatex red)
&gt;around the area where the push rod tube exits the cylinder head.  I never
&gt;tried this solution, so I can't comment on its effectiveness.


I'm going to comment on this, yep I've seen it stop leaks, but as a rule of
thumb:

O-ring seals NEVER, EVER, use any sealant.  That is not how an O-ring is
designed to seal and is not at all necessary as origionally designed.  An
O-ring seal works by compression of the ring between the male and female
parts, I've designed custom seals to do this up to fifteen THOUSAND pounds
of static pressure, and 5000 psi dynamic loading folks.  I've never measured
the sealing surfaces on a T4 pushrod tube set, but from the factory using
brand spankin new rings of correct thickness (of utmost importance of
course) I'd bet those buggers should be good up to 500 psi, should even hold
combustion pressure of a sorry engine with gobs of blowby into the rocker
boxes.  But they don't.  Here's why O-rings stop working.

1) knicks or cuts or slivers of material removed during installation.
2) ununiformity of the male sealing surface.
3) ununiformity of the female sealing surface.
4) incorrectly sized parts (insufficient compression)

That about does it.  Unfortunately on the happy 100k mile T4 about all of
these hold true, burnt oil has made a mess of the female bores, particularly
the head side holes, to really work those have to be cleaned spotless of
burnt oil, old permatex (that after 5k or so isn't stopping the leaks),
whatever, spotless and smooth, like using a scotch bright and solvent, not
the 100 grit paper.  Same thing down on the lifter end but those aren't so
hot and aren't inclined to leak.  Next the tubes, the grooves there that
hold the rings must be perfectly circular with no dents, and all the gunk
cleaned out there as well.  Even then those might get smaller as pressure
from the ring pushes in the tube as time goes by, probably only a real
insignificant problem but it strikes me off hand, suffice if the grooves are
clean, undented and still round they should be AOK.  Next and important is
the proper size ring, I surmize all sold are correct, material is probably
an issue, sure viton is better but then again whatever VW put in there
lasted 15 years or more so isn't all that bad from the start.  These things
have a real admireable amount of compression if all the parts are right, it
is a real SOB almost to put them in which brings the last and final point.
After all those surfaces are spotless, NEVER, EVER install any O-ring dry as
a rule of thumb.  Silicone grease is wonderful, Wesley Black Magic silicone
goo (for bumpers) does nicely, motor oil will be more than sufficient.  A
lot of it, dunk the ends of the tubes and wipe the bores, then ever so
carefully insert each making sure it doesn't catch on anything sharp as it
goes.  The chamfers cut into the heads for seating are barely sufficient to
slip a new O-ring by without it catching and tearing as the last little bits
seat, this is exasberated if the flange on the tube that forms the groove
wasn't flat and undented (what do people try to pry these out with
screwdrivers?)  All this done with anal attention to detail and no major
knicks or gouges in the origional sealing surfaces and those tubes should
never again leak while you own the bus, if they still do, perhaps you are
talking a mechanical reason.  Silicone sealer is a temp solution for this
job, about 50/50 in working at all IMHO, and hardly likely to hold up over
25k miles or so.
