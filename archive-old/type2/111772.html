&gt; Hey folks...

&gt; Weren't the right side vent windows just left units upside down?

The right and left units are mirror images of each other. The only way of
using one as a substitute for the other would be to get help from a
friendly tesseract.  I refer you to Mr. A. Square, native of Flatland and
his tale &quot;Flatland&quot; as related by Mr. Edwin Abbot.

The correct method of installation is to install the vent wing window
first and the solid pane afterward.

To install the vent wing you should tilt the lower edge onto the lip on
the body so that the inner seal and the bottom of the vertical are inside
the lip.  Insert a short piece of 1/8&quot; string into the groove on the upper
sealing groove.  Tie the string off to the vertical bar at the rear and
leave the front end of the string hang free. Tilt the upper end of the
window into place.  Pull the string to get the seal over the upper lip.
Slide the window forward and back to line the upper end of the vertical
bar with the slot in the upper lip and press the upper end of the vertical
bar thru the slot.  Recheck the lower end of the bar to be sure it is
still inside the lower lip.  Using the palm of your hand or a rubber
mallet push the window forward to finish installation.

Installing the fixed pane is a standard string-pull installation.  If you
have never done one, ask a friend who knows how to demonstrate it.  It is
not a complex process, but is far better demonstrated than explained.

                             OOK!
