A few things to keep in mind pertaining to sway bars and other travel limiting 
devices.

The camber limiter is good at doing what it does.  It will improve handling.  But, any 
setup which effectively stiffens suspension and tightens travel does transfer the side 
g-load to the tires.  Hence, bad tires will equal unpredictable, possibly dangerous 
results.  With any modification to the suspension, upgrade to better tires as well.  
Most radial 6 or 8-ply tires work well on Busses.

For those who think a corner carver has to shake out one's fillings, I own a 1965 
Mustang set up for road racing that has softer springs than a stock Shelby Mustang, a 
1&quot; front sway bar and no rear sway bar and yet can still pull more than 1G on a 
skidpad.

More important than sway bars, good ball joints or properly adjusted king pins and 
good shocks, tie rod ends, etc. will produce a ride you never dreamed possible on your 
20+ year old vehicle.
