Subject: Re: [T2] Hydraulic valves or solid?

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; In the ongoing sourcing of parts for my re-build, I have the option to get
&gt; hydraulic lifters/cam followers or solid ones. (the motor has solid lifters
&gt; currently).

Richard,

I would not use hydro lifters and cam, especially if the motor was built
originally as a solid lifter engine. The hydro case is different owing to
the need for different oiling for the hydraulic lifters. I have examined and
compared the two types of cases side by side, and although the differences
are slight, they must have been important in the original design of the
motor.
