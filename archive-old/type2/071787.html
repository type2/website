Chris &amp; The List,
      Yes it is possible to remove the fan housing with the engine in, just 
did this on mine a few weeks ago. It takes some juggling around to remove it, 
and it's a real PITA to get back in as well. The hardest part for me was 
lining up the little rubber boot for the dipstick. I took mine off to clean 
it up and paint it, but also found the source of an annoying squeak I had, 
which I suspected was coming from the alternator, which it was. The top of 
the alternator bracket was not bolted to the fan housing, the nut most likely 
left off by a lazy mechanic at some point.  The rubber boot for the dipstick 
to pass through may be the source of your leak.  Good Luck, Jeff S.
