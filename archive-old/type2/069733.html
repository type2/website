Subject: Re: Engine dismantling - stripped screw?

Don,

 Had this problem many times myself recently.  I tried drilling and using
screw extractors, but they kept breaking.  Best bet is to keep using
successivly larger drill bits until you get to the threads alone.  Takes
patience.  Then run a tap through it.  if you cant get to it because it is
hidden, try a drill bit bigger than the screw and only so deep until the head
pops off.  You can remove the tin then and drill it out later.  When you
replace the screws, do yourself a favor and go to a good hardware store (or
marine hardware, or HQ) and buy a box of stainless steel metric (6m, I think)
bolts with hex heads.  it will make yours or somebody elses life much easier.
