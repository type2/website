Subject: Re: [T2] Re:Convert Gasoline to Natural Gas?

A couple of years ago I saw a bus sitting at a garage near here. It was from 
Holland, and ran on dual fuel, gas or propane. There was a big propane tank 
on the rear deck, certainly badly in the way if you wanted to use the bus 
for a camper. It was a mid 70's bay with a type 4 engine and carbs. I wasn't 
interested in owning it.

Hoover said his late-90's experiments cost him about $1,600 up to the point
of running an experimental engine on a test block. He didn't list what the
$1,600 covered, but I'll guess that it was just the items that converted an
existing type 4 (2180) to run on propane (LPG).....not the basic cost of
the engine. He wanted to eventually build up a 1776 after experimenting
with the 2180.
He mentioned that the owner of Boston Engines had some experience with
propane powered VW engines in vehicles that were used to smooth the ice in
big skating rinks, and that they ran at higher operating temps than
gasoline powered counterparts.

Hoover said he would be looking for his parts mostly from sellers that
supplied the fork lift community. Impco CA125-76-2 carb at $122.80 (which
becomes the FB-125 when fitted with a 'feed-back' type diaphragm.)  The
diaphragm's part-number is AVI-1447-2. ....  and the model J regulator at
$73.79. Manchester propane tanks were also mentioned. He envisioned putting
the engine into Grendel  and running her over the 10,000+ foot passes in
Colorado and through the deserts of Death Valley. IMHO he was an incredible
visionary that acted on his dreams.

He also mentioned that the CDI module already in use is suitable for an
LNG-powered engine, but the stock VW ignition system does not provide
sufficient energy for reliable ignition with gaseous fuel. He said the
digital fuel controller needs a signal from an oxygen sensor, and that he
used a Bosch p/n 13913, a three-wire sensor purchased at the
FLAPS.  Earlier experiments with a single-wire type apparently indicated
the VW exhaust system runs too cool for adequate response.  The Bosch unit
uses a 12v heater element and responds immediately.

So, the envisioned combustion-control system consisted of an oxygen sensor,
a dedicated
digital controller and a vacuum solenoid valve attached to the propane
regulator.

He eventually mentioned (after some testing) that the Impco CA125-76-2 carb
proved to be too much carburetor for the task.

In December of 1997 he was very frustrated and discouraged by the many
roadblocks he encountered in trying to obtain parts and information from
suppliers. Either they would not talk to him, or they only sold to
distributors, or the parts were only available in big lots or through
dealers. And then there were problems with the clean air act that seemed
very treacherous to even look into.

Hoover spent years on his project and came away very frustrated, but he
eventually did build and run a propane powered type 4 air-cooled engine.  I
imagine the next guy that tries it will encounter a whole new and more
difficult set of roadblocks.

Somewhere in my review of the Hoover letters I did notice mention of how
much easier it would be to convert and install a water cooled engine in a
bus and run it on propane. That might be a path for some to follow. The
other thread was that it probably made more sense to go in the direction of
diesel and specifically the TDI, to better power our buses. I think a big
part of that was based on the difficulty of finding adequate space for the
LPG tanks on a bus.

Better stop here.
