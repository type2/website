Subject: Re: [T2] Disc/power Brakes on 69 bus

I put '79 Front disc brakes on the '69 front beam.
You will have to make/weld a bracket to hold the power booster
Whole thing works great and stops my '60 DC like right NOW.
Stay away from '71 as I believe those are one year only parts
Side effect is that you will have the small five bolt pattern on the front
and still have the old wide five bolt pattern on the rear.  You have
to decide which spare to carry.

&gt; parts from a 71 bolt on? Can I just switch the whole front end? Do I have to
&gt; go through all that trouble?
