I have had no previuos problems with my transmission.

Driving along a straight road coming into a town, third hard to get into,
second and first impossible.

Pull over check clutch freeplay, thats fine.

Play with gear stick can get 3rd 4th and reverse no problem at all, but 1st
and 2nd are not there at all. Drive home in 3rd and 4th, these change
smoothly.

At home loosen two bolts at base of gear stick can still get 3rd, 4th and
reverse and then eventually find second. Tighten up bolts. I now have a
second gear that I can just get and 3rd, 4th and reverse are fine.  But no
first.

Is there a procedure to adjust the plate at the bottom of the gear stick?

Is there anything else I should check?

With the plate loose should I be able to find all the gears, and because I
cant find first does that mean I need a new transmission?

The gears on this van have always been nice and crisp and easy to find and
there has been no graduall deteriation.

I would be most gratefull of any help.
