Subject: Fan Hub Removal

I don't know about Vanagons, but on my 74 that hub is press fit onto a the
tapered end of the crankshaft with a woodruff key to index it. Those babies
are on TIGHT, so I usually use a three-jaw puller to get it off. Of course,
YMMV.

Hope this helps,
Dave

Subject: [T2] fan hub spacer removal


&gt; Hello my fine feathered type 4 friends,
&gt;
&gt; I finally finished dismantling my old engine from my vanagon.
&gt; I got the fan off, and the fan housing, but there is a funky
&gt; thing with the three holes for bolts and a little dowel sticking
&gt; out.  This was what the fan was screwed in to.  I'm guessing it
&gt; is some kind of circlip thing, but I am not able to remove it.
&gt;
