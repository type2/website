Subject: Re: [T2] WR1

&gt; The rationale behind the WR 1 is straightforward. It is not &quot;another&quot; 
&gt; solenoid, it's a relay. Its purpose is to reduce the resistance in wiring 
&gt; between the battery and the starter. This is ohm's law, which last time I 
&gt; looked was good science.

OK I'll take a deep breath and start over.

The reason why people buy these is what I have a problem with. Let's say the 
starter is slow like a dead battery and you have a good charge on the 
battery.

Starter motor wiring;

The engineering (that's applied science) behind it has been done

5.6 mm diam wire and  4 feet at most, at stall torque tests of 300 amps 
science gives you a .6 volt drop, with that wiring selection. Not the 
problem.

Still slugish starting, what is wrong? The starter motor needs servicing it 
is drawing to many amps i.e. it's bad, how to fix it? ask bentely or bosch.

Or you turn the key and the solinoid wont pull or push the starter armature 
into drive position

Starter solinoids wiring:

pull in and holding draw both have hot posts off  the 50 post. Only a 2.25 
mm iginition wire that has unlimited battery go go, at 20 feet and max 35 
amp pull draw that's a drop of 2.7 volts. It's fine as well but, can it be 
the problem? Maybey if it heats up after a long hot drives hmmm now we might 
see a need for a better wire. Engineering problem? no if you pull the car 
back 30 years, yes if your engine is running too hot and your solinoid is 
going bad. I would look at improper insulation on exhuast manifolds, bad 
cooling tin, engine running to hot and old dried and cracked wiring, and 
then I would test the soliniod. If its bad it needs to be replaced.

Ohms Law? How about Faradays Law! The solinoid is also an electromagnetic 
relay, which closes the switch to the 30 post on the starter motor.
