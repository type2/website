Subject: [T2] Passenger Door Lock

Greetings Listmates (and Happy Waitangi Day to our NZ brethren) -

The outside door lock went limp yesterday. I can open the lock with the key,
but pushing down meets no resistance, and thus, the door doesn't lock.

Fixable by me? Or do I take it to my FLlock$mith?

Thanks -

BTW - What does Waitangi Day celebrate?
