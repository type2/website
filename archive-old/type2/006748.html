Subject: Fuel filler neck for 72?

&gt;For '74&gt;'79 single and double cabs the partnumber is 261 201 119 
&gt;and not available from VW anymore, the last one I got was half the price 
&gt;listed above (5 years ago). In a pick up this part is even more critical 
&gt;as the filler neck is significantly shorter.

What about the pre-74 buses?  I've got a 72 with the gas-aroma-when-she's
full problem.  Any suggestions?
