Subject: Re: EGR

When the bent tube twixt the EGR valve and the exhaust fitting rotted thru 
many years ago, a PO plugged both sides with epoxy putty, and put a solid 
gasket between flange and exhaust pipe. When I switched to a weber 
progressive carb, I just took it all off. If it's causing any trouble, I 
don't know it four years later...
