Subject: Look ma--no hands!

I'm in high-beam heaven.
Thanks to those listees who gave advice and empathy--i
got high/low beams.

giving up--at least for the time being-- on ever
finding a proper relay, i installed a foot operated
high-beam switch out of a Jeep. $8 at NAPA. (If anyone
wants the parts no. email me.) Stomp--high.
stomp--low. 

It's not as inelegant as u might think. The additional
wiring to the headlights is about 3 ft. for each beam.
I used 12-gauge wire (cud go 10 if i had to) and
soldered the connections. I bolted the switch just to
the left of the clutch and against the front wall.

I came up with other solutions that involved relays
and would put more power to the headlights, but a
simple solution with no micro chips or even
electro-magnets seemed nice after messing with
defective relays for two weeks.
