Hi list...
I've looked through the library, archives and tech articles and can't find 
any info on the following: I'm going on a trip for at least a month, but 
maybe as long as 6 months and am wondering about some basic outdoor winter 
(Trail, B.C., Canada) storage info - battery, carb, oil, cover, dessicants, 
tires etc. What to do?
Thanks
Duane
