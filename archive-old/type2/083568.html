&gt; Has anyone come up with a good replacement cap

&gt; I can't put .5 of  tank without gas coming out

Bus Depot has them.  Pay Ron his money if the
thing is metal not the all plastic jobby.  DO NOT
BE SEDUCED BY THE CHEAPO PLASTIC THING FROM
FLAPS.  The cap will separate from the part that
fits inside the neck and the darn thing will fall
into your tank.  Then you'll have to email
Dworkin offlist, because your embarrassed that
this happened to you.  Then you'll write to the
list to tell others not to do what you did and
expose yourself for the cheap idiot that you are.
 I heard this happened to someone once.
