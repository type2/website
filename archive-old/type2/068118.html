&gt;2. MS will rebuild both heads (or just the one) for 180.00 not 
&gt;including shipping with a turn around time of 3-5 days. Initially 
&gt;when I balked at naming the company who sold the engine, the MS 
&gt;guy said &quot; was it G-E-X?&quot; so he seems familiar with their 
&gt;reputation. They also rebuld heads for VW of Canada.
&gt;
&gt;Which path would you take?
&gt;
Another company that you may consider is AVP in Sacramento, Ca. 
(1-800-548-5766, if this does not work in Canada I could probably 
dig up a non-toll-free number).  They claim to use the same 
oversized seat design as Mark Stephens, and say they have had 
virtually no dropped seat problems since instituting this design 
about 2 years ago.  I have had good luck with their products in 
general, and they have REALLY impressed me with their knowledge of 
type 4 motors and their concern for customer service.

Although if GEX will replace for free, that still sounds like the 
best alternative.
