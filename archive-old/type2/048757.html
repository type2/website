Subject: Re: [T2] poptop screws

Pat Callaghan sends:

&gt; I was wondering if there is a source for the screws that attach the luggage
&gt; rack &amp; poptop to the bus.  This in on my 82 westy.  The poptop looks pretty
&gt; good except a number of the screws are rusty looking &amp; look bad.  I this a
&gt; special screw or what?  Thanks.

Take a screw to Home Depot and see what stainless steel screws they've got
that are close. This is a good place to use screws that will not rust.
