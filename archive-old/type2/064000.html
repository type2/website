Sure!  There are two Safares on this list - they are fairly rare, with
somewhere between 400 and 1200 having been made.  There are supposedly
several models, including a normal bus conversion, pop-top, and high-roof,
but I have never seen a pop top.  There are also at least two levels of
trim.  The standard one, which I have seen in both the basic bus and high
roof, includes an icebox, closet, sink, table, and fold out bed in the
rear.  The highroof also has a slide out bed up top, which can sleep one
adult or two small children.  There are additional storage areas over the
cab, in the left rear and under the dinette seats.  The deluxe model (which
I have) came with all of the above plus an electric refrigerator (instead
of the icebox), propane tank, stove, and air conditioning (dpd overhead).
The owners manual also lists a childs cot up front but I have never seen
one.

In general, the Safares are not as well made as the Westfalias, and it's
rare to see one in which the interior (especially the paneling) isn't
falling apart.  They originally came with vinyl upholstery, either blue,
yellow, or orange. They came with a second battery installed in the left
side of the engine compartment to run the flourescent light above the sink.
Some also came with an incandescant light on the small, rear closet.  Some
of the highroofs came with a long, narrow cabinet on the passenger side
near the ceiling.  Some came with a small snack tray that mounted on the
dash in front of the passenger seat.  Mine didn't come with the snack tray,
the cabinet, or the light.

The Safares have a unique, full featured floorplan which unfortunately
takes up a lot of space inside the bus.  I ended up taking out the cabinets
on the drivers side in front of the bed and moving the fridge and stove
there, leaving the area behind the passenger seat open, because I was tired
of not having any room inside.  I lost some storage space, but the
additional storage in the high roof made up for it.  I think the folding
bed in the Safare is a nicer design than the Westfalia, because it sets up
and breaks down much faster.

There are several things that seem to disappear on the Safares.  First and
formost is the large holding tank under the bus on the drivers side under
the sink.  It's plastic and held on by two weak straps.  Mine was
completely gone, and most of the ones I have seen are ready to fall out.
Another thing that disappears is the snack tray.  You can tell if it was
there by looking for an aluminum mounting strip about a foot long bolted to
the dash in the depression below the glove box.  The table was also gone on
mine, but that should be obvious.  It mounts between the rear seats.  There
should be a mirror on the side of the closet next to the sink - they are
often broken or missing (mine wasn't for some reason).  Also check the
condition of the electric fridge, if so equipped.  All of the plastic and
rubber parts on mine were rotten, and I ended up having to replace it.
That's all I can think of at the moment, but if you need more information,
just ask.  Also, I'd be interested to know the serial number on the plate
on the passenger side at the base of the b-pillar.  The lowest I have ever
seen is #624, which is my bus.  I think I've seen as high as 11xx.  There
are some pictures of my bus on the web page in my .sig.
