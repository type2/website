Subject: [Fri] 1971 Camper for Sale

The following advert appears in today's Washington Post:

71  VW Camper, runs well, good cond, $1100.
 301 870 2534

This is all the copy -- no further info as to whether it is a Westy or
a homebrew camper... call them, not me.  However, with some advance
notice, I may be able to go and check it out for friends on this List.
