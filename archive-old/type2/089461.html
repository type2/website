Subject: Bad news/Good News

Hi everyone,
I had some bad luck lately and just killed another engine..  :(  OR at least
some head work. One of my push rod tubes is bent on Terra my 65.
Disconnected the #1 spark plug and chugged on to jury duty on 3 cylinders
then home.

Good News
Got out of jury duty earlier than I would have gotten out of work.  :)
Worked on my 70's bus (SnoopyBus)  She runs thanks to Jamie Rivers who told
me the correct size bolt to plug my smog ports on my head.  She is a 2L with
solid lifters, runs strong.  Gotta get 300 miles on her this week so I can
drop it and retorque the heads before I leave for Indigebus.
http://www.fullmoonbusclub_dot_net/Indigibus.html Only 10 more days!!!!

Don't have time to post the pic of what the indigebus t-shirt looks like in
real life yet.  I'll do it tomorrow.  Time to rest up for another busy day..

Thanks for all the help from everyone!!!!

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
Snoopy
