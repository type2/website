Subject: WTB: DP 1600 Crank Pulley (2:1)

     I am looking for a crank pulley from a 1600 cc, dual port, dog-house
cooler bug.  I'd be happy to pay a fair  price.   I am in Northern Virginia.
     The reason I am looking for this pulley has to do with several recent
threads on the list regarding stock crank pulleys.  Apparently crank
pulleys were made by VW in several different diameters.  Barb &amp; Eric
(VEEWEE111) say that the 1600 cc dual port engines with the dog house
coolers came stock with a crank pulley that produced a ratio of turns of
the fan/alternator to turns of the crank shaft of 2:1.  Earlier engines had
ratios ranging from 1.6:1 to 1.9:1.  Barb and Eric say that the 2:1 ratio
pulleys have a &quot;D&quot; stamped on the rear face (FIF).
     I have a 1.8:1 pulley on my van and would like to replace it with a 2:1
pulley--more cooling!  My 1.8:1 has a &quot;D&quot; stamped on the rear face, so the
&quot;D&quot; marking on the rear may is apparently not exclusive to the  2:1 pulley. 
However, I would be interested in a good condition pulley originally from a
dual port 1600 cc dog-house cooler bug.  I'd be happy to pay a fair price. 
PLease p-mail me.  Thanks,
