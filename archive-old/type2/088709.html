&gt; &gt;Machine shop person said that if the spark plugs show microscopic
&gt; &gt;blistering on the outside of the spark plug electrode, it indicates that
&gt; &gt;the engine has bad or worn valve guides.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Outside of the electrode is the other side from where the spark jumps.

&gt; Oh Oh !!
&gt; I just noticed this same thing on my NewBus #3 plug the other day
&gt; when I had it out and was trying to determine if it was practical to insert
&gt; a CHT sender under that plug.
&gt;
&gt; I have been wondering about those small blisters I saw, as I had never
&gt; noticed them ever before on any other plug anywhere.

If you guys are referring to blisters on the white insulation of the center
electrode; I ran into this back in the mid 70's when I had my own repair shop.
I asked Champion about it then. Their engineers said it was caused by using
too cold a spark plug. They said to go up one step in the heat range.
i.e. if you are using a Bosch plug and it is a W7, then you need to go to a
W8.
This worked on all the cars that I had the problem with then. Almost all my
customers came back to me so I could see changes.
