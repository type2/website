&gt;For those that are familiar with the intestates to Mesa Arizona from the East 
&gt;coast, what are the better roads?
&gt;
&gt;I40 to I17
&gt;
&gt;Or I85 to I20 to I10
&gt;  
&gt;
As a resident of Northern Arizona I would recommend I40 to I17 then 
south into hades. OOps, I meant Phoenix. Seriously, I'd take the 
northern route to avoid the oppressive desert heat as much as possible 
weather I was driving my bus or a Uhaul. I would further recommend 
planning NOT to stay in Flagstaff Az. motels over the weekend or buying 
fuel in this town if you can help it. They get outrageously expensive in 
the summer when all the tourists come up here to cool off. Flagstaff is 
at about 6000 ft, Phoenix 2000 ft but don't worry about steep grades 
getting to Flagstaff from the east. It is a gradual incline from New 
Mexico to Flagstaff then it's downhill most of the way to Phoenix. There 
is a bit of an incline going south out of the Verde Valley that might 
slow you down a little. I would guess it's about 4 miles of 6% grade 
with a wide shoulder just in case.

Hope you enjoy your trip and welcome to Arizona.
Tom
