Here's my redfaced tale:

We went to a show in Albany at the knick and met some friends on the top
(open) floor of the municiple parking garage a couple blocks away. Had a
nice sunny picnic etc went to the show, had a fine time there etc, come
back pretty late, hop in the bus, start driving down the ramp under the
roof edge which is low enough that the antenna tip scrapes, which causes a
light to go on in my head!! the poptop is up!!! stopped inches from
disaster!

Your story is a little embarrassing, but imagine my embarrassment when I
tried to back out of my garage with the top on my riviera camper halfway up
(I was checking seals, and oops!) The fiberglass top still bears the scars
and the garage door took on a new curved shape, but luckily, no MAJOR bus
damage.  You should have seen the way my dog looked at me.  You could just
tell he was thinking &quot;You silly human, what the H&amp;ll were you smoking?!?!&quot;
So don't feel bad..It happens to the worst of us!

Ok, so it's Friday, I finally get to ask...

How far have people driven with their pop tops up?

I just got back from a weekend of camping down Santa Cruz/ Big Sur, and one
evening after the drive-in, I was tired and forgot to take down the pop top
('76 Westy, so it's a huge air dam when it's up).  So there I was, cruising
down Hwy 1, trying to figure out why I couldn't get the bus to go over 55,
and what was that damn squeaking noise coming from the back?  My wife fell
asleep during the second movie, and was still asleep in the back (she'll
sleep through anything), so she didn't even notice.  But just before my
exit, I realized that the top was still up.  I had gone about 10 miles down
#1 with nary a problem.  Got to the campsite, checked everything out, and
it
was all fine.  Gotta love the Westy :-)  Boy did my wife laugh when I woke
her up and told her what I had done.

Later,
N.
