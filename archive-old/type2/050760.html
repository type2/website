Subject: Re: [T2] Mercedes bus that looks like a VW??

Gabe Pari sends:

&gt; I have seen a bus driving the streets of Southern California that looks like
&gt; a vw bus, but with a mercedes grill and emblem on the front.  Is there such
&gt; a thing?? or is it someones chop-job?

Sounds like a &quot;custom auto&quot; to me, Gabe.

And on the subject of custom autos: does anybody here know where I can get a
peace sign that's the same size as a Bus's VW front emblem? Real Source has
peace signs, but those are the size of the VW emblem on a Bug--not large
enough.
