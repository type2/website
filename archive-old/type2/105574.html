Subject: Re: [T2] Exhaust noise- from where in head?

&gt;&gt;The banging came from the right head, and the builder (1.5 hr drive) on the
&gt;&gt; phone figured exhaust problem or broken rocker stud.  Pulled the valve
&gt;&gt; cover and checked out the rockers/valves and they seemed normal. Ran the
&gt;&gt; engine with each right plug pulled, and the noise goes away with # 2

Maybe the fresh-air injection ports in the head? Common problem around 74-75
when they system was used (and is generally stripped off now). Easy to check -
just stick your hand in the engine compartment to the front and aft of the
intake manifold at the head - feel for blasts of hot air.

Let me know if you need the fix...

-Eric
