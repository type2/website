Subject: [T2] triangle window wont open...

I was wondering if anyone can help me. I cant seem to get my rear 
triangle window open on my 79 Westfalia. It is one of those push 
button, turn lock, and push open ones. I have tried some lube but the 
lock part just wont turn. Is there an easy way to remove the lock 
without being able to turn it?

thanks.
todd.
