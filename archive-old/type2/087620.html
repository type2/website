Subject: Everybus 2002

OK, guess the cat's out of the bag. Barring any unforeseen surprises from
the universe in the next few weeks, I will be attending Everybus 2002. In
my own bus. She got a clean bill of health at her break-in adjustment.

I'M SO EXCITED!!! I can't hardly believe it.

Current definite itinerary -- I'll be leaving here (L.A.) around the 12th,
heading east on the I-10. I'm confirmed to visit Art Lynch and his lovely
wife in San Antonio.

Hopeful additions to the itinerary: bus gals in AZ? Raise your hands.
Wendelin wants to meet Big Mama. Nancy? Dawn?

After San Antonio, I plan to head through Atlanta to visit my co-cat lady
in busdom, Chris Huff.

Kelly is going to take in Wendelin after Everybus to fix her nose, and he
figures she should be ready just about by High Country in the fall. I'll
hitch a ride to DC with Dolan, hang out and visit a gal in PA; maybe I can
get my best friend in CT to come down for a visit. Then I'll fly home the
following weekend, with a return trip planned for High Country.

Woo-hoo! On the road again....

Nikki
