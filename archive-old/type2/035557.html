Subject: Hub Cap and Bad Mojo

Uh oh, this is the first I heard of this! My recommendation is to give the
Hub Cap two or three days off. Take it fishing or hiking or something like
that. Then sit down with it and eat a really good meal with your favorite
food and plenty of liquid refreshment. Then incant the following &quot;Ha! Oh
great and powerful hub cap, symbol of VW unity, show your followers what
they overlooked at the last &quot;gas station&quot; check up. Show us what we may have
forgotten to check during the last big overhaul...show us oh great hub cap.
Ha!&quot; Then put the hub cap to bed and take a nap yourself. When you wake up
you will know, what if anything needs to be fixed on the bus. For extra
safety, before you set out on the next leg of the journey, hold the hub cap
up in the sunlight and drive the bus past it. If the hub cap glints when the
bus goes by it's safe to go. Really.
