Hi,

Has anyone ever come up with a good substitute for the rubber seal around
the pop-top and cargo rack?  I have a 72 westy and was wondering if
there was a cheaper solution?
 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
On my 76 Westy, I bought seals normally used on overhead garage doors, and 
bolted them to the inside lip of the fiberglass pop-top with stainless 
steel bolts. The seals are basically long flat white plastic strips with 
flat white rubber seals along one edge. The available lengths make it 
possible to tailor them to fit both sides and the rear of the pop-top. Cost 
was minimal, maybe total of $30 including bolts, 4 years ago. Bought them 
at a home building supply yard, such as Lowe's.

I drilled holes about every foot in the lower edge of the pop-top, and 
matched those holes with similar holes that I drilled in the lengths of 
seal. It took some trimming at the rear, but that is your job. All I am 
supplying is the idea.....you fill in the creativity and skill and judgement.

They work fine for me. But, I'm not an 100% purist in regard to my Westy. 
Maybe 93% ?  :~)

I consider them an improvement over the factory designed rubber seals, 
which collected water, corroded, and came loose eventually, after 18 years. 
You asked for a &quot;good&quot; substitute. These have been good for me.
