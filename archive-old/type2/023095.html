Subject: Trips Scheduled  (long)
Mime-Version: 1.0

January 15
I will be in Caracas, Venezuela for about 2 weeks.
Would like to meet bus folk, if possible.

February 16
I will be in Laredo and Nuevo Laredo for about 1 week.
Hoping to see my friend Seth and other bus folk, if possible.

March 16
Mary Beth and I arrive Zurich, Switzerland.
We will spend just a short amount of time there before going on to other 
Swiss destinations.
 From there, we go by train to Munich, spend a couple of days, and then on 
to Northern Italy by automobile. Returning stateside around April 10, or so.
Hoping to meet bus folk, if possible.
If not possible, we will be back in 2003 with Casper for a longer visit.

May 1
We depart Houston in Casper and will trek through the Western half of the 
USA, hoping to make it as far North as the lower regions of Alaska and a 
bit of the Canadian Rockies.
We will spend our whole 7 month trip itinerary on the West side of the 
Mississippi, until time to just make it  to Thanksgiving near Buffalo, NY.

If possible, we really would like to meet as many bus people as possible 
during this trip. It always proves to be a wonderful experience.
Details on planned routes, times, etc. later as the facts 
mature..................

May 1, 2002
Eastern USA and Canada...........
(If we hold up well enough from 2001)
