Subject: Clutch cable (Was: First Ride)

&gt; Will do.  I'll also get under him and see if there's anything doable in
the mean time.

Got under the bus and traced the clutch cable from front to back.  No damage
that I could see, except that the dust caps on both ends of the tube are
missing and probably have been for an age or two.

I sprayed 1-2 oz of WD40 down the tube at the rear end and it seemed to free
up the cable some, at least I was able to shift up and down through the
gears better.
