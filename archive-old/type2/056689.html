Thanks to those of you who have passed along suggestions to correct this
problem but It is still with me and I am near to spending the hard earned
bucks and taking a change on a machanic that who knows if they really know all
that much about air cooled or not. 
 The problem is, I set my idle speed to 900 but it will not maintain after it
warms up and then ranges from 600 to 1000 rpm.  When pressing the gas at idle
the engine revs but when driving the bus just jurks and engine will not rev
up.  I just put this rebuilt moter in the bus and did not have this problem
with the old badily worn one.

Your help will save me dollars
