Subject: Parting Out - 4 Vanagons, 5 Buses, And A Couple Miscellaneous Things

I've been accumulating vans for a while and I need to make some room. The
list of parts they contain is WAY too long to inventory here in the time I
have available to me right now - best thing is, if you want/need something
e-mail and ask. Generally, the bodies are relatively rust-free, California
cars.

Vanagon:
1 - 80 Vgn Wflia (not much left); 1 - 84 Vgn GL, &quot;bronze-beige&quot;;
1 - 85 Vgn GL, lt blue (working sun roof);
1- 88 Vgn GL, burgundy, with wide fiberglass bumpers and body molding,

T2:
1 - 74 transporter, wht/blue;
1 - 75 Wflia (icebox/sink model), orange;
1 - '78 Wflia (not much left);
2 - 79 transporters, both wht/brown.

Misc:
1 - 68 Porsche 912 Targa &quot;basket case&quot;. All parts including rebuilt motor
and some extras, new carpet kit.
1 - 73 Bug, beige.
1 - 59 &quot;Ponton&quot; Mercedes 4door (all original, solid, all parts - including
original tool kit and full Mercedes workshop manual, stored since 1970, one
driver).
1 - 66 Valiant (well it STARTS with &quot;V&quot; anyway), small V8 (273 cu. in.?).
Body is in great shape - good restoration vehicle.
1 - 2.1 waterboxer engine, nearly new rebuilt (I think I can provide
papers - I'm helping a customer sell this one) $700.00 plus shipping.
