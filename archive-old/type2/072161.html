Subject: Re: [T2] Why do we paint tin?
Cc: type2_at_type2_dot_com


&gt;The tinwork should have AIR blowing through it, and it should NOT get hot
&gt;enough to burn the paint. IMHO of a properly running engine.
&gt;
&gt;(and, on this topic...if you can, use a &quot;real&quot; automotive paint for your
&gt;tinwork.  krylon/rusto/etc are SOFT in comparision..even after 10 months
&gt;dry time..)


If the tin on your engine is getting hot enough to burn off paint, there is
something wrong with your engine!  Even the heat exchangers do not get the
tin that hot.

The best way to prep engine tin is to blast it first, spot putty and sand
any imperfections, then use a good grade of automotive primer and paint.

And lastly, use a semi gloss black for the tin, that was the factory shine.
If you do all this, your tin at least will look factory fresh!!
