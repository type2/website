Subject: insulation &amp; carpeting
Message-Id: &lt;v04011701b41d149b89a1_at_[204.167.110.118]&gt;

it's fall, and the westy is getting cold already. so, it's time for me to
actually insulate the thing. i've been mulling over several possible ways
of dealing with this, and here's what i've decided to try.

dad is a carpenter, and has an extra roll of this roll-on rubber stuff that
goes underneath asphalt roof shingles. i forget the brand name, but it's
pretty common. We've decided to use this as a vapor barrier on the insude
surfaces of all the outside walls, as well as the floor [since lots of
melting salty snow will soak through the carpeting and rot the floor
panels]. this stuff is pretty neat. it kind of melts to the surface in the
heat of the sun, so, we're going to force that process on the inside with a
heavy-duty hair dryer. the trick is going to be getting it into all the
nooks and crannies.

for the inside of the side walls of the bus, i'm going to run the stuff
down as far as i can reach. we're planning on drilling some small drain
holes to allow condensation to drip out of the bottom [underside] of the
panels, near the rockers. If i can get the ruber down there i want to make
sure the holes are rubber lined to prevent rotting. i haven't looked at
this yet to see if it's feasible all 'round the bus, but that's on today's
list of to-do's. the walls will be packed with fiberglass batting, and
sealed with plastic. with the drain holes in the bottom, i can make a nice
tight seal.

I'm also planning on replacing the carpeting, and this is where i have some
questions...

1) any recommendations for types of carpets? I'm planning on getting
remnants [if possible] from a place nearby that deals in that sort of
thing. but i'm wondering if i should look for anything in particular as far
as durability. i don't have a problem with buying this new if i have to,
but i'd prefer to save here if possible. I'm not really in interested in a
pre-cut carpet kit since it won't fit some of the customizations made to
the camper interior.

2) the old carpeting and padding was glued to the floorboards with that
spray-on adhesive. PO was really sloppy about it, and got glue all over a
bunch of visible painted, surfaces as well. is there somehthing i can use
to remove this glue without damaging the paint underneath? I would imagine
that most chemicals that affect the glue will likely also affect the paint.
i'd like to not do that, since the interior paint is in good shape for the
most part. ideas?

thanks,
