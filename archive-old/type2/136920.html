Subject: Where to wire Stereo power?

I would like to install a stereo in my 73 westy and I am in need of ideas
of where to pull the power in order to power it.  I would like to wire it
traditionally where you have an ignition controlled power source and a hot
all the time power source.  But if that is not possible, then a switch can
be installed on a hot all the time wire for the ig wire input.

Where do folks pull their ignition electric wire from?  I will likely run
a hot all the time wire up from the battery area.

As to speakers, my bus has shoddy speakers installed in the doors, so I
will pull those and put some decent ones in.  For the rear I am just going
to use some two-way box speakers from big lots.

I am tired of powering a small boombox from a 100 watt plug in inverter
for tunes.

Thanks for any and all help.

Mark
