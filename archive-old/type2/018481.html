Subject: Tight git fixes 12V choke connection
Message-ID: &lt;37642C1F.D6C62B8C_at_informix_dot_com&gt;

The 12V connection to the electric choke on my 1977 2.0L had broken off and rather
than spend money on a new choke just because the metal tag had broken I found a
way of fixing it.

The two rivets that held the tag on are quite chunky and will take a 2.5mm drill
to a depth of about 5mm - enough for a small self tapper and a new tag. I actually
used a small picture hook, the type bend from a strip of brass, drilled out
the nail hole for the screw and used the hook part as the male part of the spade
connection.

Hope this helps out other tight fisted van owners.
