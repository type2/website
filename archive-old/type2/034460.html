Subject: solex dual carb jetting (con't)

well i found what i needed on the idle/mix screw settings.  so that's
taken care of for tomorrow...but i did find some great info in the
archives on jetting for the stock duals.  i got out all my books and
found out i have way off jetting sizes!!  
127.5 main
140 air correction!!  yikes.  according to the books i should have a
132.5 main, and 150 air...at the minimum!!!  so i will be playing with
jetting sizes over the next few weeks.  thanks to an old david s.
message about mikuni jets fitting solex carbs!!!, i will be getting
the correct ones tomorrow.  any ideas on where to locate the correct
air correction ones??

an interesting piece of info: my 411 manual says:
left carb 
135 main
150 air correction

right carb
135 main
175 air correction!!

different air corrections between the two carbs!!  also the engine
SHOULD be identical in a 72/73 van, to a 72/73 411.  yet the 411
jetting charts all show larger main jets!!  why??  anyway i will be
doing some trial and error changes on the jetting...at the very least
i hope to find the larger stock sizes i should have in my carbs
already...(and to think, the ole` van always purred real good...could
it actually run smoother &amp; faster??)...=P  

hey i just got to thinking, the jet sizes in my carbs now seem to be
about right for a 1600 motor.  maybe the PO got them from an old
type3??  hmmmm?? 

 question....does anyone have an old mircofiche on all the carbs
parts??  like ordering original rubber gaskets from carb to air
cleaner??  or the rubber sleeve that connects the two air cleaner
*arms* to the body of the air cleaner?? the micro fiche would be
EXTREMELY valuable to have posted in a web page!!!, for all us dual
solex owners.

my local vw dealer did have the original rubber gasket that connects
the air cleaners to the carbs!!  NOS and cheap too!!  if i had more
parts #'s i would be trying to order more of the NOS carb stuff!!

lastly what do you all use to set the throttle plate??  a feeler gauge
doesnt work with the curve of the carb venturi.  i have always set the
throttle plate to close flush with the venturi.  supposedly it is to
have a .004 gap?  will this make much of a difference??  i have never
set it!!  any thoughts??

ok, enough rambling..

zzz (wanting to put stock solexes on wifes super beetle!!)
