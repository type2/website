Subject: CV joint went

I was driving along yesterday to a click-click sound.  It wasn't
intermittent so I dismissed it as a rock in the tire because it was hard to
hear.  Today there is a grinding noise. I can feel it through the acc. Pedal
and the ride is rough.

One look at the cv boots and one has a 3 inch crack in the outer boot; that
was something I noticed a month back and had scheduled time to replace but
the boot wouldn't wait any longer.  The grease inside it looks pretty dried
up.  These are original joints and boots and have never been attended to.

The other side looks ok but I'm new to this part of the bus.  How much play
in the axle in normal, in every possible direction?  I'd like to compare one
axle to the other before I tear everything down and start replacing.

I'm going to replace the parts asap but can I drive on this?  Will the one
joint tearing itself up affect the inner joint with it's boot still in tact?
