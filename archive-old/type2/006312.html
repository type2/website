Hey volks,

I have found a camper and was wondering type.  It is a 74 white over blue.
The poptop goes up like a Riviera.Has a suicide cabinet on passenger side.
3/4 width z bed.  Weird upholstery.  Blue and white vinyl.  Late westy type
ceiling, that shelf paper over wood, but only in the cargo section.  In the
front the ceiling is the vinyl material found in a transporter. Over the z
bed is a shelf attached to the roof.  Then there is a board that blocks this
from being a shelf that has speakers mounted to it facing forward.  The
passenger side dogleg has a couple id plates like my friends 68 Westy but
they are illegible.

This is not Westy interior stuff at all.  Similar but not.
Any ideas??

Peace Brothers and Sisters,

If you are going to walk on thin ice,
You may as well dance.
