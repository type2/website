yeah ain't it the truth,  lots of folks tell me they &quot;had one of
those&quot; but when I tell em I know one for sale no one is interested...

&gt; hitting you. It always seemed to me like people on this list were
&gt; getting better mileage than me but maybe it has more to do with
&gt; speed. I have routinely seen folks posting 23-25mpg on this list but
&gt; I don't think I have ever gotten better than 19 and most often its
&gt; closer to 16-18. I do drive primarily 65-70 though.

same here, of course that is the cruising speed in the slow lane of
I-95

 once years ago in my 71 I got over 40mpg but I was crazy then and
&quot;really&quot; drafted a truck for about 150 miles, I think back and wonder
how I survived my youth, I must have been within 5 feet of his bumper
for couple hours....!!!
