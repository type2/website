&lt;&lt; To the list,

How afraid should I be my Michelin XZX 
are over ten yr. now very good treed but side walls are creaking.

Thank you,

Chris

Cracking? Or creaking (or, since you're in SF, creequeing...?-)
If you've got the money, dump 'em...I don't know of any way
to actually test 'em and I've had a few chronologically-chal-
lenged tires that appeared OK 'til they were driven...They
failed...Bubbles in the sidewalls, tread seperation...Not pretty
and dangerous if it occurs on the highway...Some friends have
had the same results with barn find vehicles...Tires age, even
if they're not driven...;-(
