Subject: Re: Re: [T2] #*^&amp;%$*!!!!! sliding door falls off???

Yeah, I caught the corner of the sliding door on my 75 directly between my big and second toes, wearing sandals, OUCH!! Anyway, my problem was the aforementioned rust (the surface that the bottom roller rolled on had rusted through leaving a &quot;trough&quot;. I found a cheap TEMPORARY fix for this by placing 3/4 inch a peice of metal carpet edging ($4 at local home improvement warehouse) over this trough and then the roller rolled on it.  Remember, this is by no means a PROPER fix, but for a cheap S.O.B. like me, it did the trick
Peace, John B

&gt;So my 79 westy pulled a cute one today. I slid the door back to let my
&gt;daughter out, and as we're closing it, the bottom pulls right out of the

That is normal operation for that door.  Watch your feet, it hurts when 
it lands there.  This is usually a rust problem.  Mine needs the lower 
track replaced, and everything below it.  If you're careful when you 
open and close it, you can learn to use the door without it hitting the 
dirt.  You have to remember not to close it like your neighbor closes 
the door on his (insert trendy name here) minivan.  Just remember to 
love the bus.  And lock the door, so your not so bus minded friends 
don't end up with broken feet.
