right about now nothing would sound off the wall.

&gt; check the signal to the injector further up the wiring harness?  Above a
&gt; connector perhaps?  You've had engine out and in (yes I've been reading
&gt; the saga and wishing I lived closer) several times and since you've put
&gt; it in it's been giving you fits.  It might be that while the connectors
&gt; were apart some corrosion has set in, a spider may have made it's home
&gt; in a connector.  something is preventing signal from brain to injector.

they were only apart about a week, but your right it has to be something
like a connector....

&gt; 6 control boxes in a row all exhibiting the same fault might be possible
&gt; if you had a british somethingorother made by Lucas but bus FI systems

my thoughts exactly, never have seen a totally botched brain box.

&gt; seem a bit more robust.  If you followed the Bentley troubleshooting
&gt; from go to whoa and everything checks out, yet still have no signal to
&gt; the injectors I would start to suspect a wonky connector, probably
&gt; upstream from any 1 or 2 injectors on a side, else you would get fuel on
&gt; 1 side or the other.

right, no signal at any injector, and if even one was getting a signal it
would sputter and try to start... a wonky connector may be the only
reasonably thing left.  the trigger signal gets to the brain, connector #1
shows a trigger signal to the brain.

&gt; Check the pins where the connectors go into the brain, making sure they
&gt; are all straight and clean.  check the inside of the connector the pins
&gt; go into.  check all the connectors from the brain to the injector.  I
&gt; would start closest to the brain and go downstream from there.  Only

good point, I have been sticking probes into those connectors.

&gt; other thing I can think of would be bad engine to chassis ground.

that is not likely as I have redundant ground connections, the stock one
and a direct cable to the bolt that holds the coil tight.  all new marine
wire.

&gt; This is just a thought from far away, not being able to see, but with
&gt; the advantage of an objective outlook.

right now even subjective is help, I was laying on the deck over the
engine staring at it for about an hour today trying to &quot;will&quot; something to
jump out at me.
