&gt; Friends,
&gt; 
&gt; I've been creeping around the archived messages looking for some insight
&gt; on this problem with no luck.
&gt; 
&gt; Basically, my '70 loaf will start up great in the morning.  After it's
&gt; been warmed up (let's say I've driven 20 minutes or so) then shut off...
&gt; 
&gt; [elapsed time ~20 minutes]
&gt; 
&gt; ...I try to start it and the engine just won't catch.  It turns over
&gt; just fine, but it has a tough time firing up.  When I go around back and
&gt; open up the engine room, it smells like gas (and no, I'm not pumping it
&gt; full of gas while trying to start it).
&gt; 
&gt; Sometimes, simply opening the engine room door then trying  to start it
&gt; again works.  Sometimes not...now that the weather is warming up, it's
&gt; become a more frequent problem.
&gt; 
&gt; Unfortunately for me, this usually happens to my girlfriend when she's
&gt; driving it, and instead of rationally thinking of what the problem may
&gt; be, she freaks out all over me.
&gt; 
&gt; So, there it is.
&gt; 
&gt; Any thoughts on what may be preventing the thing from firing up would be
&gt; appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; Enjoy,
&gt;
