Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Line cutoff alternative

IMPCO catalog page 48 #FL-205

They have a .pdf catalog that you can download.

This valve is designed for gasoline and is 12volts and has a 1/4&quot; fitting 
which I believe is big enough for our needs. They have a normally open and 
a normally closed valve. I will be buying the normally closed so when I 
turn the key on it opens unless my &quot;secret&quot; toggle switch is in the off 
position.

I think the price was less than $50 and cheap insurance against gravity fed 
gasoline fires where the fuel line ruptures and the fuel continues to flow 
out due to gravity thus creating a bigger fire.

Also would be a useful theft deterrent - separate switch to interrupt the 
current to this valve when you want a little extra protection - put a 
hidden toggle switch in the camper cabinets out back or under the seat 
pedestals.
