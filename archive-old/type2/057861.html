&gt; Greg and the List,

&gt; I installed &quot;cool tin&quot; on my '69 Kombi when I built the engine a few
years
&gt; ago.  It seems to work well but I doubt if I would do it again. 
When you
&gt; install the cool tin a few modifications are needed.  I had to
reshape the
&gt; heater box tin to get it to fit over the cool tin.  This was easily
done with
&gt; a ball peen hammer.  Also, you no longer need the little pieces that
go on the
&gt; rear by the pully tin and cylinder tin.

A few years back someone instrumented an engine in order to test
whether the &quot;cool tins&quot; would reduce cylinder temperatures. 
Apparently, the results showed that the cool tins did not lower
cylinder temperatures when compared to the stock tin pieces. 
Considering that you have to bang up your existing tin to install the
cool tin, I don't think that it is such a good idea on a type 1 engine.
