&gt; i remember them being posted a wile ago but i couldent find them in the
&gt; archives, does anyone have the paint codes for late model westy's, mine
&gt; is a light yellowish.
&gt; you can see it at

Hi Tony,

If you want to know the original colour of your Westy, you can find it
out by reading the M-code plate which is fixed on the metal wall behind
your drivers seat. The first four numbers on the third row indicate the
paint color. This is what a regular M-plate looks like (for a '70-'79
baywindow):

## ### ###
### ###
XXXX## ### ### ### ###
## # #### ## #### ##

The 'X' mark the spot where the color code is. I made a list on my
homepage of these codes, if you look it up you will hopefully find out
what color was used.

If your code is not in the list, let me know so I can ad it.
