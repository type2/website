&lt;&lt; 68 Kombi - There seems to be a lot of talk about rebuilding engines.  What 
are the indications that you need to do this, and what is done other than 
replace all the seals and gaskets?

That would be the standard GEX rebuild...:-(
Unfortunately, there's no &quot;standard&quot; definition of rebuilt.
