--Can we calm down with the patriotic ranting/foreigner bashing, especially in this time of needed tolerance and have the vw bus talk that most of us are interested in?

Bus content: Having noticed that my bus (2.0L) was having a new morning starting problem, and the weather was beginning to be chilly in the morning, I guessed about a possible cold start valve problem. After turning the engine over for 10 minutes to no avail, I went around back and sure enough, the electrical connection was cracked and loose. Shoved in on and she started right up.

&gt;I'm retired, they'll get fat and lazy and go camping all the time.
&gt;They'll lurk on VW lists and get nothing done. Or like the French and
&gt;Italians just hanging around looking for the next tourist dollar.
