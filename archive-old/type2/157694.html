  Annealing.

 | Ah, I stand corrected. I don't know much about brass. It is just

If you ever try to weld cast iron, your choices (besides
silver solder for hairline fills) are to work so fast the
piece more or less never gets hot, or pre-heat the piece(s)
then weld hot then carefully manage cool-down over, say,
a couple of days.  It is for this reason that what little
of it I've done I've done in the keep-it-cold way though
that tends to be a poorer finish and is likely to have voids
(at my skill level, which is decidely mediocre).

Correct me if I am wrong -- it is hard to be real right about
something you shy away from doing...
