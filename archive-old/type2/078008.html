Subject: FS: Superb 1976 Deluxe Westy


Fellow bus pilots:

     The time has come for me to part with my beautiful 1976 Westfalia
Deluxe Campmobile.  This bus is in superb condition, and has only 88K
documented, original miles.  Adult owned and operated for its entire
life, no snow and no salt.  I'm the third owner: first a golden oldster
who bought it new and used it little, then a U.S. Army chaplain at Fort
Bragg who used it sparingly (his wife unaccountably preferred their
Vanagon), and then me.  The bus has NO RUST whatsoever. I've driven this
bus daily for five years while living in North Carolina and Alabama, and
it has never once let me down.  This is a daily driver that would be
great for the person who wishes to do the same, or with a bit of
sprucing up to have a show-winning ride.  I've had nothing but fun using
this great bus since I've owned it.

     When I purchased the bus, it had only 48K miles on it, and since
then I've taken excellent care of it mechanically and otherwise.  It's
always been professionally serviced, and by people who understand buses.
This machine will not be mistaken for a battered hippie bus (not that
there's anything wrong with loving your battered hippie bus!). All
records available for the past five years.   I don't need to tell this
list that buses like this one are few and far between, especially east
of the Mississippi and in the Southeast.  Everyone I meet tells me this
is about the nicest one they've seen.   Why buy a basket case bus when
you can own a totally reliable machine with many years of excellent
driving and camping performance left in it?

Details:
  - Sage green exterior paint with the cool green plaid interior.  The
van's paint has been professionally improved in the front and rear
sections by the best auto body man in Eastern North Carolina.  No nose
dings or chips of any kind.  Carpet in great shape, as with bed
cushions.  Front carpet in great shape also, covered with new rubber VW
mat.
   -Usual Deluxe Westy stuff: stove, LP gas tank recently refurbished,
sink with new pump, working refrigerator, poptop, stool, front table,
back table, hose for city water, AC cord for city electric hookup, rear
screen.  Also has the trailer hitch, but I've never used it.
   -Original stock 2.0 liter pancake engine with correct distributor,
regular tune-ups, oil changes, valve adjustments. Push rod seals a few
years ago.  Solid transmission and new clutch cable. Just finished a
trip from Alabama to North Carolina and back with no problems.  I would
not hesitate to drive coast-to-coast in this bus tomorrow.
    -Extras: vintage 1976 CB radio (for looks), premium $1400 Alpine
sound system professionally installed, including cassette deck, hidden
CD changer and subwoofer, repair manual.  Also have original owners
manual for 1976 Deluxe Campmobile.  Correct and very recent class D
Yokohama tires (very important!).

Location:  Auburn, Alabama.  This is on I-85 about 90 miles Southwest
of Atlanta, near Columbus, Georgia.  Fly cheap to Atlanta (have you seen
the air fares lately?) and drive home in that rarely-encountered
specimen: a VW bus that's reached its 25th birthday with only 88K on the
odometer!

Price: $6750.00 or best offer.
