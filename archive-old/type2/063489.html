Subject: Trip Report - Holland (Part 1)

Prior to this trip, the farthest I've ever driven is around 150 miles
travelling to VW meetings around the U.K. There was a big
'Euro VW Meet' in Venlo on the Holland/German border last
weekend. I decided this would be a good opportunity to take
Splitty on what I assume is his first holiday abroad, and to cure 
my own envy of the Inuvikers.

We decided to make a holiday of it and stop in Amsterdam
for a couple of days 'on the way' (it isn't on the way)

So,
2 days after the Beaulieu Autojumble, Damon and I set off for Dover
in my '62 bus. We left at 6am to make an 11:30am crossing. It's a 150
mile journey but I didn't want to start the trip with a missed boat.
Lucky we were so cautious - we made the boat with 10 minutes to
spare. The problem lay with an over-turned lorry on the infamous
M25. Along with all the London rush-hour traffic, we were diverted
along winding minor roads; the traffic barely moved for 2 hours. :-(
Once back on the motorway I floored it for the last 50 miles or so. 
The speedo needle was pegged and our knuckles were white; 
ran out of gas 10 miles from the port -- filled up from my 5 litre can
on the hard shoulder. Splitty bore the thrashing bravely. 

The ferry was nearly empty -- apparently many travellers got
stuck in the jam and didn't make it.

Arrived in Calais, France &amp; filled up with petrol. I didn't make any 
special mechanical preparations for the trip, but carried on board:
- - petrol can
- - oil &amp; pint bottle,
- - foot pump
- - trolley jack &amp; axle stand
- - big tool box containing breaker bar, grease gun, Maglite, adjustable
spanner, torque wrench, spare fanbelts, etc. etc.
- - small tool box containing, er, smaller tools (pliers, my nice new
Britool spanners etc.)
- - socket set &amp; ratchet
- - Muir (yeah, it was a squash getting him in the overhead locker :-)

Of the above, I only needed to use the petrol can and the oil.

As we crossed the border into Belgium the road quality decreased 
dramatically. There were great big holes &amp; piles of tarmac on the 
motorway!! The noise riding in the bus at 50-60 mph was deafening, 
overridden by a steady thwump-thwump-thwump as we drove over 
the 'seams' in the concrete. By about 4pm my eyes were drooping so 
I allowed Damon the honour of driving the bus, and passed out on the 
passenger side of the bench seat for an hour or so. We got lost in Brugge. 
Belgians cannot build roads, neither can they erect even vaguely helpful 
signposts. Every sign we saw was to a town we had just come from. 
Eventually we got out of the place. I got back in the driving seat and we 
decided to press on out of Belgium and head for Amsterdam for the night.

The campsite was lovely -- overrun with cute bunnies which made our
mouths water, very very clean (a man parades the site every couple
of days picking up every scrap of rubbish), flushing loos, hot showers,
masses of space, quiet neighbours. Actually, the neighbours were
interesting. 3 sorts -- middle-aged, early-to-bed Germans in large luxurious
motorhomes, young Australians in tents surrounded by seas of empty
bottles and the left-overs of spliff-making equipment, and coach-loads of 
Japanese tourists. The Australians were either very loud and in the bar,
or very very stoned and in their water-logged tents or steamed-up
cars. One young Australian guy camping next to us I swear never left the 
campsite. 

The Japanese method was interesting. They converted whole coaches
into camping dormatories. No kidding! I'd never seen that before.
Through the curtains one night walking back from the campsite bar, Damon
and I caught a glimpse of them folding seats up to make narrow beds,
creating communal tables out of thin air....

Anyway, Amsterdam was nice. We spent most of our 2 days there in
museums (the Van Gogh museum was superb, a temporary exhibition
of American Watercolourists in the Rijksmuseum was even better). I
can't tell you about the seedier side of the city as I didn't see it. 

2 things I noticed about Holland -- they drive so well. It was a novelty
to feel so comfortable doing my own speed with no over-testosteroned,
over-adrenalised young professionals trying to kill me and themselves.
I guess it goes with the naturally good-natured temperament they all
seem to be born with (everyone SMILES in the Netherlands!! Even when
it's raining -- which it did alot of!!)
Second thing -- the air is very clean. Even in big cities. I think the
emissions 
requirements must be much stricter. We noticed the engines of the
VWs at the show sounded really really up-together. No sloppiness like
you hear in alot of the British  v dubs. Plus, of course, everyone cycles
which cuts down on pollution. There were even cycle lanes (2 on each
side) along side some stretches of the motorways!!! Amazing.

We saw very very few aircooled VWs outside the VW meeting. But
Amsterdam was positively crawling with old Citroen DS's and Fiat
500's.

More tomorrow
