Subject: molybdenum grease with instalation of clutch cable?

driving home last night I snapped the clutch cable on my 70 westy, had to 
power-shift the way home.  the shop manual says to use molybdenum grease, is 
this neccesary or can I use any similar lube?  the only molybedenum i could 
find was in tiny tiny tubes, the guy at the store gave them to me because he 
only had 2 left, i'm not even sure if they will cover the entire cable. I am 
wondering if i have any other options, I don't want it to snap again 
prematurely because I used the wrong grease.  your thoughts?
