&gt; Hey this is a good idea but I have a vaiation that might be simpler. 
&gt; Lots of people use a external oil cooler, right? Just move the oil 
&gt; cooler to a box that you could direct the air flow. Use an electric
fan 
&gt; for air flow. A baffle door would direct the air from the inside of
the 
&gt; Bus through the cooler and back into the Bus in the winter. In the 
&gt; summer you just direct the flow of air out under the Bus so you don't 
&gt; heat up the Bus on a hot day.

This is an excellent idea, but you have to check out a couple of
things first.

The first is the heat output of the cooler.  If it doesn't produce
enough heat then it simply won't work.  The heat output could be
checked fairly easily by putting a temperature sensor in the doghouse
exhaust duct.  If the winter temperature of the exhaust air was in the
100F+ region then the idea might be viable.  In the stock setup, the
oil viscosity serves as a thermostat to determine how much oil passes
through the cooler.  There's a chance that the oil might be
sufficiently cooled by the oil sump and that the flow through the
cooler would be diminished to the point where heat transfer would be
minimal.

If you use a full-flow cooler, the flow would be better, but the temp
might not rise to useful levels.

You're right to keep the cooler near the engine and to duct the air
rather than the oil.  Long oil lines are not good engineering practice
unless they are large enough so as not to restrict flow.

Personally, I think that more &quot;bang for the buck&quot; can be had with a
careful overhaul of the stock heating system and possibly with the
addition of a recirculating electric blower.  This is sort of the
system that VW added to the late bays minus the recirculation feature.
