&gt;On my '78 Westy, I have a pair of pipes that hang along each side outboard
&gt;of the engine.  They look like exhaust pipes and I notice they kinda angle
&gt;up toward the heater flap valves.  In fact, the flap valves have remnants
of
&gt;flexible duct on the opening that points toward the pipes (the flap valves
&gt;have two openings, one towards the front to heat the cabin, and the other I
&gt;just mentioned).
&gt;
&gt;Are these pipes designed to &quot;bleed&quot; off unused heat from the exchangers and
&gt;direct it out the rear of the bus?  I can't find anything in Bentley like
&gt;this.


Yes!!  Excellent guess!  For some reason only '78 and '79 Buses have these
pipes.
