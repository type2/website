Subject: Re: waving at spot

&gt;Guy has a totally cherried out Splitty and I'm going by in Ole Spot
&gt;
&gt; He just sits up there and pretends he doesn't see me.
&gt;
&gt; Like I'm the poor relation and he's embarrassed.

Ummm, Mike....I don't want to be harsh or unkind or anything, but if this
is common, if it happens maybe a few times a week, there's just the
remotest possibility that maybe Ole Spot could use just a teeny bit more
TLC than you customarily give her.  You know, little bath, little rusto
treatment, tiny bit of air in the tires, stuff like that.

I'm gonna regret this, I just know it.
John
