Subject: 78 Exhaust Elbow

Hi all,
I recently replaced the exhaust elbow.  There is some sort of release valve
(for lack of a better description) that has a cap that screws on.  Well mine
blew off.  My question, what is it for, and does it need replaced
immediately?
Only reason I ask is it may have something to do with back pressure I am
thinking.....
Beep Beep,
