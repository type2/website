Subject: Re: Spark Plug Thread Chaser

I'd like to share a very effective thread chaser tool I discovered. Those 
who own the double-ended socket tool that comes with the VW van tool kit 
(e.g. my '75), which combines the wheel nut and spark plug sockets, know how 
handy this one is for safely removing and more importantly installing spark 
plugs so as to avoid cross threading. It is exactly long enough to get you 
right on axis everytime, via its aligning with the spark insulator hole in 
the tin. Now there is a chaser made by KD tools (part #730) which is also 
dual purpose (14 and 18 mm threads). The beauty of this is that the 18 mm 
end fits nearly exactly into the inside bore of the wheel nut socket of the 
aforementionned vw tool (you will have to use the 18 mm chaser as a die to 
set it in nice and snug, but it does so exactly on axis, automatically). 
What you have created then is a self-aligning 14 mm chaser that works just 
as accurately as that same tool does to install the spark plug.  There is no 
need for prayer or charma when you approach the chasing dilemma! The KD tool 
then can be unscrewed to restore the VW tool to its original configuration. 
Let me know if this is unclear and I'll try again.
