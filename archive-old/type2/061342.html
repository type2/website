Great news Oly, glad you have the heater running before the cold really hits!

I'm making this a list post because of your comment on the temperature
regulating switch.

&gt;and it indeed worked.  The only reason I can figure why the solenoid didn't
work before was &gt;either a loose contact or the temperature control switch up
on the plenum.  The temp control &gt;switch has two wires coming off of it and
the blade connectors on mine were quite loose.  I &gt;ended up bypassing mine
as I repeatedly pulled it loose while trying to reinstall the firewall.
&gt;Choosing to control the temp with the on/off switch.  

As I announced on the list recently, Nathan Badgley kindly pointed out an
error in my original article regarding my assessment of the temperature
regulating switch.  I do use a temperature regulating switch (whoops, a
pun...) but have it set to high at all times.  Based on resistance tests, in
my original article I concluded that bypassing the switch (which can be done
for certain bench tests) is effectively the same as having it fully engaged
under normal operation--but this is not so.  As the wiring diagram clearly
shows, another part of the switch is a microswitch which is triggered by the
thermostat.  This regulates the ceiling for the heated air level.  Once the
maximum heated air temperature is reached (212 degrees F as measured in the
hot air duct by the switch), the thermostat lever on the temperature
regulating swich triggers a microswitch which cuts power to the fuel pump
(and in the case of the early BN4, the fuel solenoid), preventing the
likelihood of overheating.  BTW, you'd notice eventually that yet another
switch, the overheating switch, would maintain order by kicking in and
cutting power to the pump.  But keep the double safeguards in the circuit,
they're both necessary.   Though the temperature regulating switch must be
installed in the hot air duct, if you are having problems adjusting the
bowden cable, the acceptible alternative is to install it, but just fix it
on &quot;high&quot; (that's just like having the knob at the end of your bowden cable
pulled all the way out).  So connect that temperature regulating switch--as
is often said so correctly, &quot;they put it there for a reason!&quot;

The only switch that is acceptible to swap for another is the on/off/timer
switch on the dash.  Since the mechanical timer inevitably fails with age,
replacing it with the on/off swich and wiring it to power from the car's
ignition switch produces effectively the same safety result (i.e. the
original timer limited heater operation to a specific period and would shut
it down if the car was not started, protecting the battery--by wiring it to
the ignition switch, the heater is only operable with the car running (don't
simply turn the key on without the car running to run your heater--or radio
for that matter--if it is wired as such, you'll overheat your engine's
ignition coil and fry your points)).  Instead my on/off switch is wired to
the battery so I can enjoy it with the bus engine off, and I simply trust
myself not to leave the damn thing running.  
While I'm mentioning switches, a very important aspect of tuning the heater
as described in my article and the service manual is calibrating the flame
switch.  When the heater is &quot;turned off&quot;, the blower motor must run (with
ignition and fuel circuits disabled) for a set period of time after to cool
the combustion chamber and expel residual gases.  If when you shut the
heater off the motor does not run-on, correct this problem immediately by
properly adjusting the flame switch before damage to the combustion chamber
and the blower motor fan results.

Yes, there are a lot of things to learn with gas heaters, but it's all worth
it! :)

I have a fully updated article that's about to be FTP'd (thanks to Ken) to
the website which contains more information on troubleshooting, testing, and
operation than the original (time passes..I learn more!) as well as the
important TRS correction.  I'll make a list announcement when everything's
up and running.

Ron
