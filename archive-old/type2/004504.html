jessica-
your 74 bus has no idler arm, but it does have a drag link
( $40 and  5 minutes labor ).
bushings ? your bus has needle bearings- try grease at the
fittings. you had mentioned you are working with a bus-hating
mechanic and have been forewarned- and since i assume you
got this nomenclature from the shop, it might serve you well to
also buy him a book, complete with pictures and repair info.
let's assume the steering is wobbly. if the steering box is wearing
out ( 73 and up has no adjustment capability ), it would be best to replace it,
used or rebuilt. it attaches to a pitman arm ( big clunky steel piece
which rotates and pulls the drag link which moves the tie rods ).
the drag link has ball-and-socket ends which do wear out, as well as the
same type ends on the tie rods.wear at the pitman arm or at the relay lever
(which connect to the drag link ends ) is far less common.
if you have to turn the steering wheel a bunch before the wheels start to turn,
then the steering parts are indeed suspect. since i am somewhat familiar
with your particular dilemna , may i suggest you only replace the drag link at this
time. be at the shop, and have the mechanic show you the difference between the
old part and the new part. while the old drag link is off, any slop in the steering
gearbox will be evident by a loose shaft, if you wiggle the pitman arm hard
it should be obvious. additionally, if someone wiggles a front wheel in the turning
direction,  ( hands at three o'clock and nine o'clock ) play in the tie rods will
become evident ( loose ball-and socket ends ).and if you wiggle the same wheel
up and down ( hands at 12 o'clock and 6 o'clock ) you will find loose wheel bearings
which are adjusted by tightening a nut on the hub center spindle behind the little hub cap.
don't be afraid to correct the mechanic's terminology, but be advised he will be on guard
that you know a little more than he thought you did. bring a rag and get greasy, that
alone will blow his mind ! ( get another mechanic now.....)
