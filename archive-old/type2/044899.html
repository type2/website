The brown and brown/green wires are probably grounds.  I would have to
check my
wiring diagrams (at home, tonight) to be sure, and will do so if you
don't get
the answer sooner.

&gt; Ok, I'm unable to make any sense of the wiring diagram available on type2_dot_com
&gt; so i'll ask for some advice.
&gt;
&gt; I have 4 wires coming out of a black wiring harness (tube?) in the
&gt; engine compartment of my '71 campervan.  a brown wire (not connected)
&gt; a brown wire with a green stripe (not connected), a black wire (connected
&gt; to the coil), and a striped green wire connected to the oil sensor.
&gt;
&gt; any ideas as to what the other two wires should attach to?
&gt;
&gt; thanks,
