&gt; That is the accelerator pump tube, if missing it has
&gt; most likley been ate by the engine, if you are lucky
&gt; it missed the intake valve on the way in the cylinder
&gt; and missed the exhaust valve on the way out, if
&gt; pinched by one of the valves you might get a burnt
&gt; valve out of it or it might not hurt anything, have
&gt; you done a compression test on that side of the engine
&gt; to see if you have any valve damage from the tube
&gt; going through. Phil

Hello Phil  I have seen these tubes pinch the rings on the piston before and 
have seen the pecking marks on a bunch of pistons also.  have never seen one 
mess up a valve before  but I have seen them cause a miss for a while when they 
go thur the intake valve and probably by the time the piston gets thur with 
them they are smaller and mangled going out .  Later and have fun  mark dearing
