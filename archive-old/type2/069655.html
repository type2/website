Subject: 76 Wipers hit top of windshield 

On my 76 Type II, the drivers side wiper catches on the top of the
windshield on the return stroke if the window is slightly dry.
As far as I know, everything is stock, but I may havve reversed the left, and
right wipers when changing the wiper motor. 
Are they the same? HOw long should the wiper blade be?

Thanks
