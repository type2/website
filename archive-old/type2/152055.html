&gt; So it appears I have the ignition key problem fixed, at least ont the
&gt; bench (couch). Problem was an offending little spring, and a little
&gt; cup thing (looks like a thimble but about 100 times smaller) that sat
&gt; on the end of the spring. I belive the purpose of these pieces was to
&gt; activate the key reminder buzzer. The spring was all mangled. I
&gt; removed both peices. The only result I can identify is that the brown
&gt; wire (key buzzer) no longer gets any power. I tested the outher switch
&gt; outputs at various poitions and they all appear normal. Key now
&gt; travels its full path. No more hangups!
&gt;
&gt; The brown wire wasn't connected to begin with so nothing lost either.

don't know exactly which wire you mean, but on the VW bus brown wires are
usually ground wires.
