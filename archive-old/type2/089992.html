Subject: Splitting T4 cases.. whew!!!

OK, time to take a breath...

I've banged on the ears and nothing gives; not a thou.

I'm thinking I still have a fastener in there (first try at splitting cases). 
There is a large 12-point socket-head screw down below the cylinders on one 
side only. I didn't try to remove it because, 1) I don't have that tool; and 
2) that fastener doesn't have a matching one on the other side, so I reason 
that it is not a case screw.

I've gone twice 'round the parting plane looking for hidden fasteners, like 
that sneaky one inside the flywheel flange :-)

Now, all you experienced VW folks who are laughing at me right now... please 
tell me where to look for the one I've missed :-)

Your help is, as always, much appreciated/Don Carron
