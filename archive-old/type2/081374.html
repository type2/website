Subject: buying a '71 westy

I purchased my 71 Westy 4 years ago in Oregon.  Paid $500. for her.  =
Only rust she has is driver floor pan.  Extremely easy to get parts for =
( busdepot_dot_com is one reliable source for me)   and pretty straight =
forward to work on. =20
She was my daily for quite a while and has proved very reliable.  She =
has always done well on long Oregon mountain trips (1200 miles was last =
one) but you don't have to worry about speedin' tickets.  Main probs I =
had were front ball joints and loose steering box.=20
Checking for bondo is easy, take a weak magnet with you (cheap fridge =
kind works well) magnet wont slick to filled areas.

Just my 2 cents!
