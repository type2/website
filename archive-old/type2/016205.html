&gt;whoa,  the other end of the dipstick, the &quot;muirism&quot; is that if you can
&gt;hold the handle of the dipstick then the engine is not overheating.

The handle?????  The Muirisms have got to be kidding!  I can't imagine not
being able to hold the dipstick by the handle.  I would assume the bus is
waaaaay too hot if you can't hold the handle.  You should be able to
comfortably roast hot dogs by holding the handle.  I have heard many people
say specifically to pinch or touch the tip that goes into the oil.  That is,
as we seem to agree, just plain garbage.

&gt;I will touch the handle of my dipstick, but for sure not the end that goes
&gt;into the oil!!!!   however I have a temp gauge and never was very good at
&gt;running along beside my van trying to touch the dipstick at 55mph anyway

Running along the side?  Just remove the engine hatch, if you have one, and
stick you kid brother in there.  Caution: He may need a flashlight to find
the dipstick.  :)
