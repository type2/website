Market research:

If you could buy a complete SO-23 interior scaled up for a baywindow bus, 
would you think about buying one?

If you don't know what an SO-23 is, go to the camper section of the 
technical library on the type2 website. Click on Westfalias, then click 
on &quot;homey charm&quot; or something like that.
