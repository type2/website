Subject: NH junkyard Westy

Hi folks:

I just returned from a trip to New Hampshire. For anyone who might be
interested, there is a junkyard in or just outside of Keene, NH which is in
possession of a later model air-cooled Westy.

Regrettably, I don't have the name f the junk yard, but its located just
across the street from the fair grounds. I believe the fair grounds are
called the Cheshire Fair. Should be fairly easy to find.
