Subject: sticking caliper on '71 loaf

It could be a sticky caliper but it's more likely to be an obstructed hose.
To check it, drive it enough to heat up the brakes then jack up the front
end, use jack stands of course, then try to rotate the wheels.  If one of
them is hard to turn, loosen the bleeder screw.  If you get a spurt of fluid
and then the wheel is free to turn you have a stopped up hose.  Replace them
both.  Or better yet, replace all four.  They're bad about swelling closed
and should be changed about every ten years just as a matter of maintenance.
Also, completely flush out the old brake fluid every year or two.
