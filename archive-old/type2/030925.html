oppps,  the oil filler was indeed on the top of the 411/412 engine when
installed in the non station wagon versions.  the station wagon filler was
in the top,  the dip stick was also in the top and pulled straight up.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I recently put what I thought was a 1974 1800 bus engine into my 1972
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; camper. Why I never noticed, but I didnt, but the oil filler is not in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the usual place (coming out below the alternator). It is on top of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; block just above the alternator. Does anyone know why the filler is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there? 
it is there because the engine could only be accessed from the &quot;trunk&quot; for
servicing, the station wagon had a flexible connection to the rear so it
could be checked and filled from an access area in the tailgate seal area
