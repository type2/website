Subject: Re: [T2] Battery won't hold a charge

Hi all,

I pulled the battery and went to sears and bought a battery charger it 
is a die hard 15/2 amp battery charger.
The battery is an UltraEnergy 85. It's made by Exide and sold through 
Strauss's (must be up east where I purchased the bus, I've never been 
to a Strauss's before) anyway...I hooked it up to the charger and it 
goes through its test and after about 5 minutes of charging the charger 
starts to blink, the manual for the charger tells me &quot;The battery could 
not be charged in a normal manner. This could be due to a battery with 
a partially shorted or open cell, sulfated battery plates or 
electrolyte out of ballance.&quot; Does this mean the batteries fried? If so 
what could have done it, the battery is less than a month old from the 
PO. I've already checked about the warranty and because its a used car 
the warranty isn't transferrable. I don't mind getting a new battery I 
just don't want to fry the next one if something else is wrong. Also 
what size / brands are recommended?

Thanks,

Blake
