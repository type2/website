Subject: Re: [T2] A little advice

Thanks for the advice.

&gt; I say the buses are either in your soul or not.

I agree.  I started with a fastback. I think I would trade my bus for a
fastback in a second.  But, I think old VW is definitely part of my
soul.   It has to share room with AMC Jeeps, and  1960s Cadillacs.

I did pull the engine in the fastback, and then sent it off to the shop
to have them put a new one in.  This worked great for me, but I would
have rather done even more of the work.  I have pulled the engine in my
friend's bus, and replaced it with him.

&gt;I would look for a good, non-rusty, bus without an engine. 
&gt;
This is sounding like really good advice.  Pull the engine, part the
rustbucket, pick up a engineless version down the road sometime.  That
was kind of the direction I was going, but I was thinking of trying to
keep the rustbucket around and operational.  Maybe not.  Fill that prime
real estate in my garage with something else.  (like a non-rusty version)

&gt;Any bus can be restored with enough money, but for a newbie this is too much to tackle.
&gt;  
&gt;
Couldn't agree more.

&gt;Hope this helps,
&gt;  
&gt;
It sure did!
