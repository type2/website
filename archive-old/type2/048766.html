Subject: [T2] 1/18 Drag Bus

Hey
   Just got back from ToysRus with the new 1/18 scale drag bus.  $19.99 in 
Wisconsin here.  Totally cool toy.
   Also- for people like me who collect VW toys in general- they also have a 
very big Kubelwagen toy. Much bigger than 1/18 scale. Not nearly as detailed, 
however. Pricey at $49.99.
    Still looking for our Walmart to have the Bug/bus combo.....
