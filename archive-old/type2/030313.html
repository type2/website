&gt; Steve,
&gt; Correctamundo, on killing everything that consumes the anti-freeze.
&gt; I was under the impression that's where we were going, talking about
&gt; peanut butter, and bacon loaded traps, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; But just tell me this---how in the heck is a cat or a dog going to get
&gt; inside a locked and stored bus?

Terry, 

Same way I got into the locked trunk of my fathers old car when I was ?4?
Boy was he surprised!  Especially since it was not accessible without a
key, which he did not give to 4-year-olds.  Same way kids wind up in old
refrigerators, etc. etc. I don't know *how* kids, cats, and dogs get into
places they shouldn't (I suspect magic), but I know they *do* and that an
open pan of antifreeze is a bad thing when they do.

&gt; Ever smelled rat pee that has been inside a closed up vehicle for any
&gt; period of time?

I don't know if it was rat pee, but I know what you are talking of.  And
that is without the risk of hantavirus in the SW of the U.S.  I am not
saying that keeping them out is not a good idea... just that I don't agree
on the ethylene glycol.  Use traps, use moth balls, use rat poison in
proper feeding stations, no problem.  

The best way of all is don't let it sit for long periods of time!  No pest
control system is going to work unattended for a year.  Get out there once
a week and do something (crank the engine, start it up, push it forward
and backward, shove a broom handle into the heater tube, etc.) and the
problem will not occur. Rodentia need peace and quiet... disturb them
frequently and they will move on.  Trap or bait them and it's really a
non-issue (tho these need weekly checking as well), but please use a
purpose-designed system, not a shotgun.
