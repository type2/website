&gt;&gt; Back in the late '50s splits did come in a two-tone version which included 
&gt;&gt; black. The upper half (from the belt line up (including the &quot;v&quot; in the nose) 
&gt;&gt; was black and the lower half was a color called &quot;sealing wax red&quot;. It was 
&gt;&gt; predominately found on the deluxe 23 window Type 2s.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I don't believe that color combination lasted past 1960 or so.
&gt;
&gt;It's not really black.  It's Chestnut Brown.  I think this was the 
&gt;standard color combo for Deluxes thru '58 (?).  My '81 Vanagon is black, 
&gt;but was painted that way by the former owner (a Menonite farmer).  It 
&gt;used to be Yellow/Cream two-tone (a much better color IMHO).
&gt;
&gt;BTW, does anyone know the mixing codes for Sealing Wax Red?  I need some 
&gt;touch up paint for the '64 Deluxe.  TIA.

Um, I think it actually _was_ black: I have an original deluxe door laying
around that really is black on top...

On the karmann ghia club web page, there is a paint chip and mixing page:

...also accessible from my VW page...
