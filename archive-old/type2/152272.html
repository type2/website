&gt; Part of my heating problem was I had more cold air leaking in than hot air

&gt; Wow, what a difference. No more cold air blast and I can actually feel
&gt; heat!  I can't really cover up the grille with anything with Alabama
&gt; weather. It's 20F one day and 70F the next.

nice thing about the magnetic sign material you just pull it off or stick
it back on..

&gt; Oh, if you plan on replacing the stock fan with a bilge blower, you better

I don't have that problem, don't have any stock heat just gas fired aux
heat, 100% of the heat is under the front of the bus.
