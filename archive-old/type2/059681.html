Thought I'd run this by the list again, last time I got some very interesting
replies.  From what I've been told my bay window jail bars are a one year only
gig...1968.  There are two bars in the left corner window that run at a
downward slant.  The end pieces are also slanted. (hence they where not robbed
off an early bus).  The rear window bars are the same as big window early bus.
I have yet to see another set of these bars in person, but I did find an old
centerfold from a owners handbook that shows the bars in the cut out pic.  Any
an all info on these bars would be a groove.  Thanks!
   Peace, Love, and I've also heard don't cut loose of them for under 2
Franklins-massive freak out,
     Mr. Bubble Head
