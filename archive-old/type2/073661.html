Dave,

Open your Mitchell estimating guide to the VW air cooled section. See
&quot;Tune-up&quot;. There, in the only written definition you can find, &quot;Includes
..yadayada..._dot_compression test.....yadayada.&quot; Professionals follow given
procedures. If they don't, they are shooting from the hip and they are
going to miss things. Particularly with the feedback systems of later cars,
a cylinder down on compression will give off excess hydros which will throw
off the computer. The error code will say &quot;rich/lean&quot;. You can spend all
day long fritzing with ignition and fuel systems and get no where in these
conditions, so the compression test comes first, even with these later
designs. The professional approach has always been and still is,
mechanicals/ignition/fuel, in that order, for all maintenance and
diagnostics, because that is the only procedure that insures something
isn't missed and time/money wasted in futility. 

The reason I know this method works is because my come back rate is less
than 0.5%. Those insisting upon a &quot;tune-up&quot; are always advized to see any
one of my competitors they wish. When they have had their &quot;tune-up&quot; and no
results, they will be back for me to actually identify the problem with
professional procedures. 

Thanks for the feedback.

&gt;Give it a break....you seem to be talking about what you get when you take
&gt;a 2001 american car in for a &quot;tune-up&quot;.  about the only thing that is
&gt;going to happen is it gets hooked up to a diagnostic machine after new
&gt;plugs are inserted.
