Half the time my Westy will start,  half the time not.  The check light
comes on,  and dims when I turn the key to crank, but nothing happens.  I
can spin the starter using a pair of pliers, sometimes that helps, sometimes
not.  The battery is new, tests well and is better-than-needed, but jumping
it starts it (most of the time).

I've gone through the library's steps, but the inconsistency of the
start/nostart throws it out the window.

Is it the starter/solenoid you guys?  I'm frustrated as hell cause I can't
nail it down!

Any thoughts would be great, Thanks!
