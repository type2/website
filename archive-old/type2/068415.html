Subject: Oil Change/Valve Frequency/Kendall Oil Question

Hey Now!

Got a couple easy (I think) questions that I'd like opinions on.  All
info is regarding my '70 camper...

First, did an oil change/valve adjustment 3 months ago on August 17.
Since then I have only put on about 1500 miles.  I know that oil should
be changed at this point just because of time but should I also do the
valves again or is it ok to wait another 1500 miles??  I don't drive it
&quot;hard&quot; - mostly short 5 miles to work and back.

Also, where can I find the much praised Kendall motor oil??  I've looked
casually at Wal-Mart, Checker Auto Parts, K-Mart etc here in Boulder
area and don't seem to see it.  I haven't asked for it yet but it sure
doesn't seem to be stocked on anybody shelves...I'd like to give it a
try if I can get a hold of some!

Thanks for the help!

Mike
