Subject: I love ads....

that are nowhere near the truth!!!!!

2nd sentence in 1st line:
&quot;This tall sliding door factory original bus is fully restored.......&quot;

And then the 2nd paragraph [5th line] has this in it:  
&quot;the drivetrain is none other than a whisper quiet and finely tuned Porsche 914 2L with VW 2L heads......&quot;

Factory original bus and fully restored my eye!!!
