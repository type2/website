Subject: tuneups and gas mileage. - 77 Westy

I did a gas mileage check today on my 77 Westy Loaf, and was surprised/shocked
to see it worked out to 16mpg on a Canadian gallon, (about 12mpg on a US
gallon). I know it needs a tuneup, but all that can really change is the
plugs, since I have a Crane optical 700XL ignition system. The brakes are not
dragging, air pressure in tires is good, alignment is spot on. Timing is right
on the money. Engine is excellent shape. Can plugs themselves really cause
such a drop in mileage, (they DO have far too much mileage on them) ? I think
I usually get about 20mpg around town. Comments please?
Courtney
