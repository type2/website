Subject: Re: ground rod

Maybe a little anal but a good idea...
Static charge + right conditions = boom.

Drive a 4' length of copper water pipe (cheap) into
the ground 3'6&quot; or so and you have a excellent
earth ground.
  I would check local code for grounding rod depth
if you want to be sure.... all in all very
little work for an x-tra safety level. you could
argue that this isn't worth the effort.. given the
low probability.... but....

------------------------------
Isn't grounding the bucket and the chassis a little
extreme? After all it's gasoline not hydrogen. I would
think just removing  the battery is sufficient.
