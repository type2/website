&lt;&lt;Egads! the $35 sending unit I just bought to hook up my light and my oil 
&gt;pressure gauge doesn't fit on the '77 engine I have. Well, the threads will 
&gt;fit, but the unit itself is too big without extending it out quite a bit
with 
&gt;a small piece of pipe, which I recall is not a good idea.

I used a small brass tee to extend mine and to be able to mount the factory
sending unit in the same port with the guage sending unit.  It worked
properly for ten years and 100,000+ miles.  The sending unit failed
recently, but I think that was normal attrition rather than something
related to using the extension.

What is the make and part number of your sending unit?  I need to replace mine.
