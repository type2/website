Subject: Re: [T2] Friday Westy question

&gt;  When you sleep in your camper, do you find it
&gt; more comfortable with your head to the front or to the rear?

I like to sleep head forward, whenever i sleep the other way, which i do when
its hot so i can leave the hatch open and get fresh air,  I alway bang my
head on the overhead cabinet when i wake up. I'm usually disoriented from
driving till was so tired i had to pull over and sleep and don't know where i
am when i wake up.  Reminds me, I meet a couple people at a concert once who
were telling me about asking a local cop somewhere in the southern us where
they could spend the night.  the cop pointed to a grassy area and said &quot;you
can stay their no problem&quot;  They went to sleep in a quiet grassy area.  Early
in the am they were awaked to the roaring sound of traffic.  They were in the
median of the highway.  Apparently the cop thought it'd be funny to play a
joke on the &quot;hippies&quot; in their &quot;Hippy van&quot;  The group wasn't amused and had a
heck of a time trying to pull into the passing lane of a busy highway from
the median in their bus. Personally i also get a lot of crap from police
because of my bus.  Granted up until last year it was about 20 colors, (now
its vw lime green metallic, soon to be original sage green again after new
panels are installed) but, It sucks to get a hard time for your choice of
car.  I also once had to unload the entire contents of my westy to cross the
canadian boarder, that is a westy full to the brim with climbing and camping
gear, all meticulously packed, it took the boarder patrol half an hour to get
all the stuff out and 45 minutes to search the car then left me and my
companion to pack it all back in , Anyone else have any interesting police
stories.
