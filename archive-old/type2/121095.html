Subject: Re: [T2] Late bay Westfalia box info needed

In our 78 Westy I moved my stool/garbage box BEHIND the seatbelt arms-
allows a drinkholder cubby box to go between the seats.  To do this, the
tire holder box cover was converted into a door on hinges over a now
tools cabinet (sits flush with cabinet now), and the floor was raised a
bit to level the box (heat outlet disabled) so it could be climbed on to
get above.  Should be visible in my site a listee set up on geocities (I
can't modify it as I don't know the password)- If it shut down then too
many of you accessed it this month and I can send a private pic!
