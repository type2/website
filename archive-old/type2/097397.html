Subject: Two huge backfires and one disabled bus

Help?

76 FI stock Westy.  Driving up a slight incline on Friday and suddenly I hear two of the loudest backfires from my bus (ear rattling gun shot types).  Then the bus stalls out.  I restart it once and get it into a parking spot in a nearby park and it shudders to a stop.  I try to restart, it cranks but does not fire up.  Battery good, gas getting to engine.

Ideas?
