&gt; What does it take to convert a pancake bus(78) to upright motor(bug engine
&gt; 1600dp etc...)

here's your chance to learn how to do it, get someone locally who can help
you, barring that someone locally to do it for you (and let you watch)
what ever you do DON'T get one from GEX or most other &quot;crate&quot; engines


unfortunately or fortunatley depending on perspective, the 1600 just can't
hack it pushing the 78 type 2 around. the rear end is different and the 2
liter is a fuel injected bus, which means you have a lot of parts to buy
besides engine stuff.
  others on the list have much more details on how to rebuild the 2 liter
engine, you won't be disappointed
