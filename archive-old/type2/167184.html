  longish  story

If it were me, I would have the bus towed.  It won't be cheap but then you can
take your time and properly fix your bus at home.

Minor/moderate repairs on the road are one thing, but with replacing
heads/engines things are rarely as easy and straightforward as we wish they
were.

How many miles away is it? Seems its not toooooo far away?

-Daniel

&gt; let me add that i am comfortably back at home in saint louis, mo.&gt; Goethe is
however still in blackwater, mo 14 miles west of boonville,&gt; mo.
