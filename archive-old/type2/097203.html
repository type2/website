Subject: re: VW MK2  1.8   8 VALVE ENGINE IN BAY CAMPER

Hey Gary,

I have been pushing around the possibility of a Subaru 1.8 liter  OHV
transplant in mine.

I know the cooling is an issue, but what has been suggested to me is the
mount a rad on the rear, or run bellowsflex tubing all the way to the front
for a rad mount there.

Creatively suggested was two small rads, one mounted in each air scoop with
a fan on each, a small rad like a fiero or something may work in that case,
then it still looks stock.

The subie motor is not that hard to cool and does not require a huge rad.
Plus a bonus, the engine is a boxer, bombproof, puts out 77-80 hp stock (10
more than stock type 4) and with an easy upgrade like a weber, one gets the
power out to at least 85 hp.  All in a package that weighs less than a type
4.  Easier to work on??  Don't really know.  I feel really comfortable
working on them, more so than the type 4.  And, I feel comfortable working
fuel injection.  But there certainly is a draw to a carb system that is
economical, inexpensive, low maintenance, and fairly easy to work on.  I
will probably order the Kennedy adapter and do it next summer (I am planning
a wedding for this coming up spring)

Whats the draw of the mk2 engine you are considering?  What are its specs?

Thanks and Kindest Regards,

Mark

&gt; Hi List,
&gt;
&gt; Similar to the recent Alfa engine transplant info request, I am looking
for
&gt; information on how to install a 1.8 MK 2  8 valve engine into a 76 bay
camper,
&gt; and recommendation re rad placement and other tech items to consider or if
&gt; others have gone before me with less than positive results, all responses
are
&gt; appreciated,
&gt;
&gt; thanks,
&gt; Gary
