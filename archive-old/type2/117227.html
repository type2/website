Subject: '86 Camper GL for Sale - Montreal, Quebec

Good morning,

I will soon be placing my '86 Camper GL for sale in Montreal, Quebec.  The
vehicule is in excellent working condition and the body is very good.  The
color is champagne beige.  Also, I recently installed new brakes and tires
on the van, and can include a beautiful matching trailer that tows behind.

The only things a buyer need know is that the VW symbol is missing and the
pop-top seal and screen could use replacing.  I plan to do these finishing
touches sometime this month, so now is the time for best deals before I fix
up the cosmetic stuff and most likely raise the price.  Other than that I
will leave the CB radio, AM/FM CD Player and Color 5&quot; Television and assure
everything works amazing.

This car is ready to go on-the-road cross country right away.  Now is the
time for good deals, because I haven't sat down and detailed everything and
washed the pop-top fabric.... but mechanically everything is A-1.  At this
time I'd let it go for $10,000 negotiable..... so please contact me and we
can discuss any questions you may have.

Quite seriously I love this van and would enjoy keeping it, but we've got a
'73 for camping and don't have place to keep two vans over the winter.
This vehicule was basically a gift, and as nice as it is we just do  not
need two vans!

Please make me an offer and/or come check it out in person!
