All,

I have a 77 Type II.  Just put an AVP rebuilt engine in it last month.  I am
having one major issue that my mechanic and I can not figure out.  I am
hoping you all can lead in me in the right direction.

After the bus warms up with some driving-anywhere from 5-15 miles, the bus
'hiccups'.  I will be on the gas and the bus will start to buck.  I can
lower my speed around 55 or below and I generally will not have the problem
anymore.  I have also recently replaced my fuel filter,  put a used double
relay in (off of another bus), and replaced the fuel pressure regulator.

I have been able to get to my destination each time I drive it but it never
is a good feeling.

Anyone have any ideas as to what could be the problem?

Mark
