Subject: Re: [T2] engine number confusion

Are you saying it has the California exhaust setup (catalytic converter not
inline with the muffler but tucked next to the left-side exhaust manifold,
O2 sensor, etc.), California ignition (hall effect distributor, etc.) and
California FI components?  I suppose there would be nothing wrong with VW
putting a California engine in a Federal car.  Or maybe a PO did a complete
swap-out?

Subject: [T2] engine number confusion

&gt; I received my birth certificate from the wolfsburg museum yesterday for my
&gt; $500 '79 camper and was pleasantly surprised to discover that it still has
&gt; the original engine in it!  I'm confused on one issue, though.   The
engine
&gt; code is GE and everything I'm reading in the type II library indicates
that
&gt; it's a California model.  However, the emission sticker on the engine lid
&gt; does not indicate that it meets California standards.  There is no
&gt; reference to California anywhere.  The camper was originally imported to
&gt; the port in Jacksonville, Fla and from what I can determine finding scraps
&gt; of paper in it where it was sold one or two times, it spent most of its
&gt; life in the southeast.
