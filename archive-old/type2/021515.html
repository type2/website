George:
I'm sorry to admit it's been a while since I used it. Only one pointed vehicle
functioning recently (80 Westy) and it's not REALLY driving yet.
In 1969 I bought a Sears automotive multi tester and it has a scale for point
resistance. It's a volt meter, really. 12Volt scale, I suppose. put the leads across
the points, turn on the ignition. If you get a total BAD reading (12Volts) the
points are open usually. bump the starter and try again. I suppose good is  1.5
volts or less. Amazing how often non-pitted points test bad and the other way
around. If they test good, turn the rotary switch 1 notch and check the dwell. Nice
old tester. Big investment of $100 or so back in 69 ( bought the 60 Corvette for
$1100 a couple months later); much bigger dollars back then!
