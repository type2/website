[...]
&gt; Ok, I was recently sent a set of these by a list member in Toronto.
&gt; He indicated that these were STOCK items on most Canadian buses.
&gt; 
&gt; The part number off of my fans is:
&gt; 
&gt; 211 959 113 C  Fan
&gt; 959 511    Switch (In dash)
&gt; 
&gt; These are way cool, I can't wait to put them in my bus...
