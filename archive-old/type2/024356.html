My right heat exchanger is bathed in oil. Running my fingers under the
valve cover I don't find any oil.

I had thought that the oil might be getting in by way of the fan
housing...took that apart, installed cooling flaps that PO had removed,
cleaned a bunch of old greasey gunge from inside the housing, put
silicone sealant over a small cut on the dipstick bellows, reinstalled
everything, with hose clamps on the bellows.

Still leaking--I can't tell where from. Almost looks as if oil is
getting INTO the heat exchanger.

Any ideas?
