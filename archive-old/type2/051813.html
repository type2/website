[...] Master cylinder.  If it was the booster, the behavior would be 
either the opposite of what you are experiencing, or the pedal would be 
very hard (and with very difficult braking action) all the time.  You 
need to rebuild or replace the master cylinder, and do so before driving 
the bus any more.

&gt; Question...Master Cylinder or Vacuum Booster?
&gt; 
&gt; I start the bus, hit the brakes and they are very soft...to the floor 
&gt; as a matter of fact.  I take my foot off the brake and pump them 
&gt; again...not as soft...now it feels firm.  They feel even firmer with a 
&gt; third pump.
&gt; 
&gt; Is this hard to fix?
