Subject: Obscure Torque Spec Needed

Because of a terrible genetic defect passed along to me by my fathers side of 
the family, i.e., all male offspring seem to have become mechanical engineers 
by education and profession,(we also have it on good authority that we have 
no perceptible social graces and appear to have somehow gained the ability to 
mentally &quot;disappear&quot; whenever female someones happen to start a conversation 
with the phrase &quot;Lets talk about us...&quot;) I have given in to the urge to 
remove the crusty fan/pully assy. from my ' 78 2.0L and disassemble it in 
order to have the fan cleaned of 25 years of accumulated gook. It has been 
sent out to be magnafluxed, and will then be powder coated and rebalanced 
when the fan belt pulley is reinstalled. This brings me to the subject line 
of this email. I need to know if anyone out there has the torque spec for the 
fan belt pulley to fan. &quot;Tight&quot; is not acceptable. Something in ftlbs, inlbs, 
or Nm would be just spiffy.
Thanks,
Robb
