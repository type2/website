Subject: '77 Heat? 

        Jim,
        The volume of hot-air delivered should be enough to
lift a sheet of paper off the dash and blow it back toward you.
My '70 came with one of those fuzzy-carpet dash covers and its
not practical- the defroster levitates it! (bleed air from main cooling fan)

        Your '77 should have a separate little electric blower for 
heating air which sits above the engine and blows into two flexible
air-hoses which connect to the heat-exchangers. Check them for holes
and the fan for output. 

        Your heat exchangers should have a flapper valve separate
from the heat-exchanger. Some kind of flexable hose connects the flapper 
valve to the hot-air tube that runs along the middle of tbe body of your 
bus. On my 914 a sheet-metal tube connected the heat exchanger and flapper
valve.

        Check all four flexable tubes. Check that the control wires
both exist (left and right) and that they operate the flapper valves
to their limits- they're adjustable. Check the power and ground
connections on the little fan, and the fan speed control (if any).
There's always the back-up of disconnecting as much of the hot-air
system as you can and removing any blockages that my be found there
(idle pieces of paper, for example!).

        When I was a kid, we used to go skiing in the family '68 and
it was warm and toasty up in the front passenger seat where I liked
to sit.

        Bill
