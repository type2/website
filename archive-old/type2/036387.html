Subject: nicorette for the bus?

hey all, here's the scoop.
i've been trying to get my bus running(emphasis on trying) for some time 
now.  well, last night i grounded a few things, changed the starter, and 
checked my valves.  i'm not even going to go into the valves, because i'm 
sure you've already heard about my 1/4 inch valve gap.  well, charged my 
battery up over night, threw it in, hit the key, and she was cranking very 
good.  those of you familiar with my history of bad cranking will know that 
this was a great accomplishment.  well, she didn't fire.  i was on my way 
back to the engine to pull out my dist. as to change the points and 
condensor, when i noticed a large amount of smoke rolling out of the enging 
compartment.  don't worry, no fire, just lots of smoke. and trust me, don't 
inhale that stuff, ewwww. here's where the trickyness comes in.  i changed 
my gen. when i had my motor out, and the new one didn't have the, i believe, 
ground screw that the old one had(the screw into the body of the gen. toward 
the fan).  so, i grounded this to the gen. stand.  i didn't do this 
actually, isaiah did.  it was that wire that was smoking.  the one that 
comes from the voltage regulator.  does anyone know what could have caused 
this???  any help would be greatly appreciated.  i need to get my bus on the 
road, even if there is salt.  i've gotta do some body work anyways.  TIA
