&gt; I'm a Newbie and heres a newbie question. I was investigating an oil leak in
&gt; my 76 loaf. (2.0 liter fi) I took off the right lower pan, and there was
&gt; this ...thing, that looks like a spring on a little cable, that goes to a
&gt; pully. (the cable is broken) so i don't know where it goes. When i pull on
&gt; the cable, the spring goes Click,click.  the only ref book that i have at

it sounds like the cable from the thermostat to the cooling vans in the
engine cooling tin,  when it breaks it defaults to the full open position
so your engine should not be in any immediate danger.

&gt; the moment is Muir's. and i didn't see anything about it. What is it!
&gt; Heres another question while i'm here. What does it mean when your oil as a
&gt; gas smell?

lots of answers possible there, would probably need more information.
how is starting?
how is idle?
gas mileage?
