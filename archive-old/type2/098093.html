Subject: Re: [T2] engine is coming out, advise please 

I agree, you should get the Bentley.  I have the
Haynes and Bentley.  The haynes sometimes has better
descriptions of how to remove things as i recently
discovered on my release shaft bearings.  But the
bentley has much, much better diagrams that are more
thorough.  

As for taking out your engine, my advice is don't even
use a book, I just did my first engine drop and they
tell you to remove so many things with little
description.  As another list member told me, start at
the bottom and go counter clockwise taking off
electrical wires that are connected to the body.  then
go around the tranny taking everything off that will
keep it from coming off.  Then get some jacks under
there and take them off.  I did mine as a unit and
must say I am impressed with anyone that can do the
engine by itself, i just don't see how because there
is no room.  Anyway, I had a much easier go of it as
soon as I stopped using the manuals and started just
looking at the engine.  I also labeled every wire with
masking tape so when i put it back in it will be easy.
 I think i only had about 10 different plugs to take
off, a couple of hoses above the tranny, and the shift
linkage bar a few other ones.  Following more advice
of another list member, definately jam some tunes
while doing this, and good luck
