Subject: Re: [T2] Curtain info needed

On the left side of the early Westies, there should be an elasticized cord 
running along the bottom edge of the windows to keep the curtains down. Look 
for the screw holes in front of the jalousie and behind the rearmost 
window.... If I had an extra, I'd send it to ya..
