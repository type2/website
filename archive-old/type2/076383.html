Subject: Re: [T2] Westy interior panel patterns

Russell,

Thanks for making the patterns. I don't mind adding the files to my website
and since I work here at home on Autocad I can plot the drawings and mail
them to people too.

I have learned a lot from making my website, but I am not sure the best way
to make a download of these files available from my website. If anybody has
advice on how to do that I can have the drawings available in no time!

(Russell send me the files in ACAD14 format)

Subject: [T2] Westy interior panel patterns


&gt; I've completed and checked patterns for the sliding door and rear hatch
&gt; panels.  These are based on my 71 Westy, and, I expect, will be applicable
&gt; for 68 thru 72, and possibly others as well.  So now I need someone to
step
&gt; forward and provide space on their webpage to load these files so list
&gt; members can access them. Perhaps the Type2_dot_com page can accomodate this.
&gt; These pattern files are presently in AutoCad 2000 .dwg format, but I can
&gt; convert to AutoCad 14 .dwg and/or .dxf - whatever the consensus determines
&gt; to be the most desireable format.
&gt;
&gt; Hal will be tracing additional panels and sending them to me in the
future,
&gt; so, before too long I expect there will be a complete set of patterns
&gt; available.
