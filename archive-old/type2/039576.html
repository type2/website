&gt; I wrote &quot;*think*&quot; for '68-72 half shafts because I have owned a '73, a

&gt; have not owned a '68-72. so I don't *know* if they are the same.  

HOWEVER the half shafts from an automatic and a manual are NOT
interchangable nor are the automatic half shafts compatable from left to
right... automatic half shafts are ID by a single ridge running around the
shaft about half way along it's length... since the difference is very
small they can be bolted up but they will mess up something if you try to
drive with em.  (double check your Bently since the information is coming
from memory, but I KNOW they are different and NOT interchangeable)


&gt; changed, tho.  If I am mistaken, Rob, and you were talking about the half
&gt; shaft, which extends from the transmission to the stub axle, tho, please
&gt; let me know.
