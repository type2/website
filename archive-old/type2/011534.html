	Thanks Charlie &amp; Hoop.
	Understandably the family would want to stay close rather
than taking the opportunity to meet us, nice people though we
are. I hope they get a chance to read Joe and Mark's notes
someday, just to know that not all strangers were a danger
to their daughter. This is just making me sick. The family
will be in my prayers, and I'm an agnostic. Well, it can't
hurt.

	We live in a pretty safe part of California, but if you're
traveling from there to there and need to take a nap near
Oakland, CA, and don't have another arangement, park
in front of our place. 5827 Moraga Avenue, Oakland, CA.
510 594 1567. We're in the book. At the Thornhill/Moraga 
Avenue exit from highway 13, second stop south of highway 24.

	Now to a happier subject. We attended the 6th
annual Rolling Concours at Pacific Grove this last
weekend and there wasn't a single VW bus, of any flavor,
in the parade! We've made it twice with our single cab, which
gets as many smiles and waves as any other old car on the
parade through Pacific Grove, 17 Mile Drive and Carmel.
This was a year for the Corrado, which developed a last-minute
gas leak, and the truck not being cleaned-up, we just spectated.
Its a great show. There should be more VW Busses in it though.

Anyone want to meet there, mid-August, to enjoy mostly faster
and more expensive cars? :) And the aquarium, etc, etc. Besides
the obvious sports cars, the parade did feature a Citroen DS,
four Borg Wards and a '67 Ford Country Squire with fake wood
on the sides. And for you aircooled extremists, there WAS a
Porsche 917 (4.5 liters, flat 12) at the auction. The show-off
on Lighthouse Ave from noon to six pm is fun, the parade
is more fun and the barbeque at the town hall is fun too. Two
of our four trips we've shown-up at about 5:30 and still had
a ball. Think about it. I'll send out notes next summer.

	With planning one could camp at Big Sur or up Carmel Valley or other
attractive places, but with a 3.5 year old, we stayed at The Deer Haven
