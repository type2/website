Subject: speedo cable

When I bought my bus a couple months ago the speedometer didn't work and the 
po told me that all I needed was a new cable. When I drive around I have the 
cable unhooked from the actual speedometer and the little thing in the cable 
does not turn. So my question is do i only have to replace that one cable 
because i have gone to some junk yards and I have noticed that There is the 
cable running from the speedometer to a small box that is way behind the 
front kick panels. So I guess my final question is are there two Speedometer 
cables (one from the speedometer to the small box then to the wheel) or just 
one that goes straight to the wheel. thanks
