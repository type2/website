&lt;&lt; Does anyone have info on smoke generators?  These are used in theatrical 

productions as well as photographic set-up shots.


Anything that creates smoke might be used around a running engine's intake 

components.  Of course, there is some risk involved in using a lighted 

cigarette.... tho I've seen it done.  A non-flammable smoke source would be 

better.  Maybe the model train guys have an idea [Seuthe??]??
