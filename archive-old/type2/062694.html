Subject: '74 Campmobile

Hey Volks,
        I de-lurked a few weeks ago, wanting to get a '71 Westy for a trip
to California, but since then, I've come across a '74 Campmobile about 10
minutes from my home.  Its not in terrific shape, but mostly because its
been sitting (on pavement, not grass) for a year and a half.  The interior
is in great shape, seats are good, full poptop canvas is strong and in
working order.  The frame is good, (PO Ziebarted the whole underside), and
the body is, for the most part, rust free.  The track for the sliding door
is bad, and definitely needs replacing.  I saw one in JCWhitney for $99 --
should that be a problem to install a new one?
        It looks like it has the stock 1700cc engine, but I don't know if it
runs, since there is no battery and it appears that some hoses are
disconnected.  I would like to switch it for a 1600 dual port, if possible
(yeah, I know, it'll be slow with the 1700's gears, but I'm used to it).  I
hear that this type of change-over would require a rear mount of some kind.
Has anyone had any experience with this?  Is it something that a fairly
inexperienced person could do?  If not, how much am I looking at to have
Gunther do it?  Having never removed an engine, I simply don't know the much
about swapping engines, but I don't think I can pass up getting this bus for
the price.  It may even run, as it sits (PO said it was running fine when
parked, but she didn't get a driver's license, so she only drove it once!?),
but I still would eventually want a 1600cc, as I simply can't afford parts
and labor for the bigger engines, so changing to a 1600cc really needs to be
an option for me down the road.  Could someone please recommend what I
should do to keep my costs down?
        I am really considering buying her either way, because if I don't
she'll turn into a junkheap just sitting there, but I would like to know if
I'm kidding myself thinking that I can put a 1600cc in her.
        A few other things I can mention...she'll need tires.  Are they
going to cost me an arm and a leg?  195/75 14s I think.  Also, someone
vandalized the bus and threw a rock through her front passenger window --
Will this cost me $500 to replace, or should I have no trouble finding one?
        Add me to the Wanabus stats!  Please help me out with this, I am
starting to become a bus addict, and I want one very badly!  Everywhere I
go, I'm always pointing and shouting &quot;Westie!&quot;.  If you really think bus
isn't going to be able to work for me, please tell me, because otherwise I'm
going to buy her.  (And no, I won't tell you where it is so you can buy it
after telling me not to get it! ;)  Thanks everyone,
                                                 -- Eric
