Subject: [T2] 69 Westy questions

Hi Everybody.
I just signed on to the type2 list, although I've been on vintagebus for 
half a year (67 deluxe)

But I just bought a 69 hardtop Westy in white.

I have a couple of questions:

1) Is there supposed to be chrome outside trim strips in any of the window 
rubber?

2) Will the window from a 67 rear hatch fit the 69? Is there a rear defogger 
on the 69?

3) It's a 1600 SP. Is the engine tin different from bug engine tin fron the 
same year?

4) Does anyone know of a pick-a-part or junkyard in/near Los Angeles with 
some bay window busses in it? I need the driver's side rear side window (the 
one with the vent wing, but I have the wing)

5) How much should I expect/hope to pay for a clean Westy stool in the 
yellow/tan color smooth vinyl?

Thanks a lot.

Glad to be a 2 bus family now

Jason
