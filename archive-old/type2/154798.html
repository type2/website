Subject: Man!!! Bus doesn't start! (Part 2)

Ok, well, I shorted out the ignition (starter) wire with the positive lead
from the battery, and sure enough, I heard the starter motor come to life.
So... now I know that both my brand new wiring harness is good as is my
starter.

Unfortunately, I now realize that my brand new ignition lock is BAD... the one
that I spent like 3 hours installing. I'm trying to figure out just HOW it
could have gone bad like that, and so soon? The bus ran and started fine for
several weeks. The ignition lock still works when used to turn the accessories
on and to turn the car in the &quot;on&quot; position, but when I turn the key to start
it, nothing... not so much as a peep from the starter.

I'm not sure where I got the ignition lock from, but it was brand new along
with a bunch of other new parts. Do I just buy yet another one? Or is there a
better option?


Thanks guys...

Todd


Oh yeah, 1973 VW Type-2 with an 1800CC in it and all brand new 1972 wiring
harnesses.
