Subject: Wind wing fix?
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

     Without boring you with the details, in one of my all-time bonehead
moves, I was forced to break in to my own car.  (Don't ask, and please don't
tell me what I shoulda done---I feel stupid enough already).  ANYWAY, like any
other bus thief, I popped the knob off the wind wing with a big screwdriver (I
somehow managed not to damage the pillar or bend anything).  Has anyone ever
tried to fix this, or should I just try to find another complete unit?  Thanks
for not laughing.
