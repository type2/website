&gt;When the Front wheels lose traction, say right, the only friction in the 
&gt;front is the wheels sliding sideways against the ground.  Turning the 
&gt;&gt;wheels to the right, to be rolling in the direction of the slide reduces the 
friction and thus speeds up the sliding.  Using brakes at this 
&gt;point to reduce the rolling friction ends up in locking the brakes in 
&gt;the rear wheels, thus one is now spinning.

Can't see how to get into this situation, and I've spent a lot of time sliding
(I used to race carts). However if this does happen, same rule applies.
Steer into the skid IE: front goes right , steer left (back goes right steer
right). in either case, you are trying to make the front end go to (or back to)
where the the rear end is going. If the front end goes right, steering left 
should make it easier for the front end to go straight, left, and harder
top continue to go right.


NOTE: I'm not talking about understeer here which occurs when the front end 
isn't turning as tightly as you have the front wheels set. This is the
dreaded front wheel drive, &quot;Bing! you are going too fast! You are going
straight! You will continue to go straight until you are going slow enough 
to turn. Thank you! Bing!&quot; sign that pops up on the dash when you enter a corner
too fast.
