&gt;It can be real critical to make sure the flanges meeting the
&gt;heads are still parallel as well, as often they aren't and take the heater
&gt;box or header pipe to a big belt sander to attempt to true them up

Good advice, but, lacking access to a large belt sander,
use a straight edge across the manifold tubes and whatever
grinding / filing tools you have, and keep checking.
