Subject: Windshield Replacement

Volks,

Part of my very long saga of being burned (twice!) by
&quot;restorers&quot;, I'm now in search of a replacement windshield for my
'78 Westy.  I need a source.  ~Checked library - only
installation info there.  ~Checked archive - a couple of hits,
only one had the glass: windshieldstogo_dot_com.  They want $142, and
I have to pick it up in Columbia, SC (I live in Augusta, GA) or
have it shipped for another $160!!!

Anyone have a better recent lead?

Cheers!
