&gt; Anybody know why ceramic
&gt; coating the headers seems to be &quot;popular&quot; ?

Ceramic coating on &quot;new&quot; headers contains 
the heat and lowers underhood temps...a new
header is prepped and coated inside and out.
An old header &quot;might&quot; be sand blasted,
cleaned and coated on the outside. A VW
heater box might benefit from the coating,
but the actual header is meant to throw off
heat...
The wrapping is only for racing...The wrap
leads to early failure of the metal whether
from containing the rust or heat stress...
A few guys on other lists I'm on tried the
wrap but were not happy about the effect
on the headers... ;-(
