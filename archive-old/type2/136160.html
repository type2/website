Subject: heater

You said:
&quot;Maybe.  I won't know for sure until I try it.  There's very little air
coming through the system as it is.&quot;
 
When I was putting my 78' Westy together I got very little airflow despite all of the proper components being in place. It turned out that a mouse had gotten into the heater tube that runs under the cabin floor and had built a nest. Once I cleared out all of the debris I had decent heat. I added a bilge blower inline in the tube to help at idle. I have a BA 6 gas heater to install but need to get the intake fan for that and am waiting until after the paint job is done.
