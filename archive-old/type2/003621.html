Subject: Fw: Wiring Meltdown

&gt; Help
&gt; You will recall from my post earlier in the week, I wanted to get my horn
&gt; working.  I was troubled by the wiring and mentioned the fact that I was
&gt; gently yanking, not good, remember?  Well HapyBus melted  a few wires
today.
&gt; Shut right down and then a bunch of smoke.  Looking at the scene, I
noticed
&gt; a few wires melted.
&gt; I am going to do this on my own.  Thinking I will have to remove the dash
&gt; for easy access.  Is there anything here I should be concerned about?  How
&gt; about new wire?  Is it a simple as going to FLAPS and getting wire?  Or is
&gt; there something special, certain wire I need?  Then what, just splice and
&gt; repair what is melted?
&gt; HapyBus seems to do something like this the week before every rip I have
&gt; planned.  Supposed to go to Chicago on Wednesday and Whitewater rafting in
&gt; WV over the weekend.
&gt; Oh well, it will be a great learning experience.
&gt; TIA
