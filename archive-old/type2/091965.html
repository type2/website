Subject: Re: need idle advice

When you say CO screw, do you mean the idle screw that Jay mentioned? 
 The one right on the throttle, big old slotted job?  Or is there 
something else... See, i had the same problem as him, and i fixed it, 
but i don't really know how, so i can't really help him.  I just wonder 
if my mixture is messed up, because i messed with that screw...  Maybe 
i'm just being a hypochondriac.  

Thanks.
