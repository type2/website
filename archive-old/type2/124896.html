Subject: rear main seal

do not just replace the rear main seal.

always inspect the rubbing surface area of the shaft that the seal touches.

You will be wasting your time and money if the shaft has a groove or is rough

you can usually polish out most defects to get a reliable sealing surface,
but you cannot polish away a deep groove.

be sure to pre lube the seal and the shaft, where it rubs against the seal,
with grease
