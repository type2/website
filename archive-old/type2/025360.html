Thus spoke H Steven Dolan of dworkin_at_mtolympus.ari_dot_net on 8/17/00 6:49 PM:

&gt; There are some debates that can only be ended with actual empirical
&gt; evidence.  This appears to one of them.  George Lyle has volunteered to
&gt; provide that evidence in a week or two by hooking a manometer into the
&gt; engine compartment and measuring the pressure.
&gt; 
&gt; It seems to me that further discussion on a theoretic basis is fairly
&gt; non-informative.  I think that it would be far more productive to await
&gt; George's test.  OK?

Actually, Mr. Lyle will probably need to make several measurements: there
should be *negative gradients* extending from the various boudaries with
still air to the fan (lowest pressure).  Pressure will decrease (per
Bournoulli's law) in areas where air flows faster. (example: the pressure
between the sparetire bulge and the body will be 0, but between the fan
housing and the firewall will be lower. (assuming an upright engine)).

There will be a second (negative) gradient begining at the circumference of
the fan and extending to free air.

(Of course there's a positive gradient from the center of the fan to its
circumference, but if George can devise an experiment to measure it he'll be
able to take his place along side Franklin, Michleson/Morley, Ruthford and
Millikan. :) )

The point is to think of them as &quot;continuous functions&quot;
