Subject: Re: [T2] adhesive panel repairs?

&gt;BTW, I &quot;think&quot; every car in this years Indy Race has a Honda engine...
&gt;Anyone confirm this...?-)
&gt;

So what is American and what is furrin' anymore? Remember those &quot;built 
in the USA!&quot; Harley guys? LOTS of that motorcycle is made overseas now, 
assembled here. The line is blurring...

Saw a Harley gas tank - &quot;Made in Taiwan&quot;... Brembo brakes. 
Magnetti-Marelli fuel injection components...

One friend argues where the profits go decides whether it is American or 
Furrin'... I argue if fewer and fewer American are working for a company 
(see GM and Ford assembling in Mexico and Asia), who cares where the 
profits are going b/c only a select few at the top are reaping those 
profits...
