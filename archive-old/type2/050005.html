Subject: [T2] Ron out next week

Just a quick note to say that I'll be out of the country next week, so any
email sent to my personal address (busdepot_at_email_dot_com) after tomorrow will
not be read for a week. (While I'll try to get internet access while gone,
it's not a sure thing. I will be calling the shop periodically, though.)

Email sent to the general Bus Depot address (sales_at_busdepot_dot_com), or via the
website form, will continue to be answered in my absence. And it will be
business as usual at the shop.  Actually, my trip comes at a good time, as
we are actually caught up for once and are shipping most orders very
quickly. (Of course, Murphy's law says that as soon as I dare to say this,
we'll be deluged! :-)
