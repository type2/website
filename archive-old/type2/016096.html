I don't believe this info was ever on the Type2 (Loaf) list.  Lots of PNW
people here.... and who knows where it could be carted off to.

PLEASE take a look.  http://www.YourVW_dot_com/

P.S.  on a personal note I posted a message to the Vintagebus list that I am
going through a substantial career change ... I am now self employed.
Anyway, the first project (3 to 4 months) involves living out of my '67
Westy and driving back and forth from Seattle to Lake Havasu, Arizona.  If
anyone needs deliveries or so forth, please contact me.

Hello List-

Sometime between 10:30pm tues. and 8:00 this morning someone stole my '66  
kombi from N. 41st and Stone Way in Seattle.  I am hoping Seattle-area
listmembers can keep an eye out for it.  The bus is pearl white, has some
old damage in the nose, is missing the rear bumper and has a beetle
exhaust.  It also has one of those crank-up roof vents you would find on
an R.V. In other words, it is a p.o.s., but it is my p.o.s. and I want
it back!  The lic. # is 862CDM.

Thanks,
Tristan Shaffer
