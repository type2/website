Subject: Remove dash padding?

 Hello All!

 Come spring my 70 westy will be out of the body shop looking strait and
 true!  Once that happens Im going to move on the interior improvments
 I have in mind.  Carpet in the front, tweed front door panels and kick
 panels along with new Beard suspension seats which are looking quite
 possible in that I may have found a cheap, comfortable seat that will
 accually mount in my bus.

 The problem is that my dash doesnt look the best.  Some PO apparently
 tried to remove a radio at on time and it looks as if they used a screw
 driver to try and pry it out.  Needless to say the vinal as well as the 
 padding are in sad shape.  I thought about removing all of the vinal and
 padding, smoothing the surface, then recovering the dash in grey tweed.
 Any coments as to how difficult this may be or if it is not recomended?
 Any other suggestions as to how to improove my dashs appearance?
