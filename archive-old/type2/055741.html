Quoth Sean Bartnik &lt;sbart7kb_at_www.mwc_dot_edu&gt;:

&gt; &gt; A couple of months ago, I have seen that somebody have scanned a 78 westy 
&gt; &gt; owner's manuel and have putted it on the web.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Anybody remember the adress ?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; Yes, that's me.  The address is
&gt; 
&gt; http://www.type2_dot_com/bartnik/myvan.htm
&gt; 
&gt; Then just click on the link for the '78 Bus owner's manual.

Note that the manual is for a bus, not for a westy -- or did I miss 
the information about the westfalia equipment?  Wasn't that part 
covered in an extra manual?

BTW towing thread followers -- take note of what it says about 
towing on page 65:
