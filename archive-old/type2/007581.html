Hi,

&gt;  Should I wrap the cooler in
&gt; preperation for even cooler weather?

 Dunno: don't you have a thermostat on this thing? If not surely it takes ages for the oil to
warm up from cold?

&gt; By bus came with the aux. fan in the engine compartment.  The PO had
&gt; removed to do some engine work and never reinstalled it...which knob on the
&gt; dash controls it? 

 It's swtiched on by moving the heater knob that controls the amount of heat (rather than where it goes) all the way down: there's a contact on the lever.

&gt; I believe it runs through a relay, could I not put a
&gt; simple toggle switch and run the power direct to the fan?

  Yup.
 
&gt; as usual my bus was all over the road.  It has good shocks
&gt; and tires though the tires are passanger.  The steering is good and tight. 
&gt; Would LT tires really make that much difference?

 Yup.

  Would it not help if the
&gt; bus was lowered all around a little(flame suit back on)?

 Not much- with soft tyres a couple of inches here or there won't help.
 Maybe if you had good tyres it would make things better but there's no cure for bad tyres.

Cheers,
              W.
