Subject: Things that go bump?

Hello pals,
I just bought a 72 Westy, in really nice shape, but
for some reason, no bumpers. 
So, I need a set of front and back 68-72 bumpers,
brackets, overriders, even splash pans if they're out
there. 
The straighter, the better.
I'd prefer something in So. Cal. or at least from
someone coming this way, because shipping would
probably double the cost of the things. 
Anyone have anything? Or know of a source/yard out
here?
Thanks and good vibes,
Jason
Los Angeles
