&gt;&gt; Bus Depot agreed to correct a situation with which I was unsatisfied. I
&gt;&gt; appreciate that however
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I called BD this morning to see when the replacement order that I had
&gt;placed
&gt;&gt; on 10.2.00 was shipped. Not only had it not been shipped but there was no
&gt;&gt; record of it at all. I was assured that the order would ship today but
&gt;that
&gt;&gt; it what I was told last week. I asked to have them call me back with a
UPS
&gt;&gt; tracking # and they said NO!  I asked if I could be called
&gt;&gt; back to confirm that the order was in fact processed and shipped today
and
&gt;&gt; they said NO! I asked if I could give them my UPS account # so I
&gt;&gt; could have the order shipped next day air and billed to my account(which
&gt;by
&gt;&gt; the way was goind to be $2.00 cheaper then what I was going to pay BD for
&gt;UPS ground)
&gt;&gt; and they said NO!.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;You purchased an extractor system that rusted out on you, and asked for an
&gt;exchange. No problem.  But this was way back in July. We agreed to exchange
&gt;it for a better system for the difference in price, because you felt (and I
&gt;agree) that another Empi system would probably do the same thing. This is
&gt;why I always recommend the O.E. system, despite the difference in price.
But
&gt;you never followed through with the exchange.

I called BD to purchase an OE system. Before getting off the phone I
enquired when it would ship. After being on hold for several minutes I was
told that the item I ordered was not available. I was offered the system
that I purchchased but was not told to it was an extractor system. When I
received I NEEDED to use the bus because it was the only mode of
transportation that I had at that time. I decided to just deal with it.

&gt;Then, two months later, you asked if we would still honor the exchange that
&gt;we had offered you months earlier. You didn't have the box or packing
&gt;anymore, meaning we very possibly will not be able to get credit from the
&gt;manufacturer and will have to take an $80 loss, but still we said yes.
Many
&gt;other companies would have declined to honor the exchange two months after
&gt;requested, or allowed only an exchange for another of the identical item,
&gt;but we agreed to stand by it and send you the better system as requested.

There was nothing special about the packaging of the extractor. I was in a
plastic bag inside a plain box filled with newspaper shreddings. I do not
recall any mfg of distributor markings on the box and there seemed no reason
to keep it. In fact part of the pipes were sticking out of the tattered box
when I found it on my front porch


&gt;The order placed 10/3 had not shipped as of 10/11, but would have (and
will)
&gt;arrive within the 7-10 day working day timeframe we promise.  You waited
two
&gt;months to exchange the unit, so one would think that you were not in a huge
&gt;rush, but yes, it will arrive within the time frame we specify.

I was told by Brain on 10.2 that the OE muffler was in stock and that It
would leave bus Depot the next day when a tail pipe came in. I was in a
hurry and made that clear. If it had been shipped out UPS ground when Brian
said it would I would the bus would be on the road by now.

&gt;The reason that the clerk could not find the invoice originally is that he
did not know
&gt;we were shipping an exchange that was first authorized two months earlier.
&gt;He simply had not searched that far back.  But the order was indeed in the
&gt;pipeline and scheduled to go out.

WRONG! He did know that because not only did I explain it to him but he read
me the notes off of my account to the same effect. After putting me on hold
for a few minutes he had no explanation for the lack of shipment. But told
me it would go out today.

&gt;No, we do not call people back with tracking numbers.  We simply do not
have
&gt;time!  Sue me if you think this is out of line, but my first priority is
&gt;getting my customers orders out.  You are more than welcome to call the
&gt;following day if you'd like the tracking number.  Paul had assured you that
&gt;it would go out today, and I just checked on it and it already has.

I was assured the same thing last week by Brian and it did not happen. I was
asking Paul to provide me with concrete reassurance. I do not think it is
unreasonable under the circumstances.

&gt;We also cannot bill shipments to other people's UPS accounts.  We have been
&gt;burned on this.  If the other company denies that they authorized the bill
&gt;to be sent to them, gives us a bogus account number, or simply doesn't pay
&gt;it, UPS goes after us.  We had a $60 freight bill go to collections,
against
&gt;my credit record, because the customer who said &quot;bill my account&quot; gave us a
&gt;closed account number, and the shipping company reverted the charge back to
&gt;us. I had to fight with them for two months to set my credit record
&gt;straight. Never again.  By the way, if you ask any other mail order company
&gt;to ship a product and bill it to your UPS account, they will also say no. I
&gt;have never heard of any mail order or internet retailer doing this.

No attempt was made to explain this to me. I am glad you took the time out
to do so. Although my company will do this for repeat customers( and I am a
repeat BD customer) I understand and respect you explanation.

&gt;It seems to me that rather than complaining, you should be complimenting us
&gt;for offering you a &quot;hassle free&quot; full exchange on a product several months
&gt;after purchase, well after our posted return policy.

If you will refer to the first statement that I made where I said, &quot;Bus
Depot agreed to correct a situation with which I was unsatisfied. I
appreciate that .....&quot; and I do. I hope you recognize that.

I was not complaining but recounting a customer service experience that
related to shipping of orders that I found frustrating. Bus Depot shipping
was the original topic of the thread and that was the extent of my post.

In the past,  I have come to Bus Depot's defense several times at bus
campouts and VW events and encouraged people to do business with you.
