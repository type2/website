Subject: Re: [T2] Cooling question


&gt;As my favorite engineer* once said, &quot;Parts left out cost nothing and have 
&gt;an infinite service life.&quot; If VWAG coulda left them out, they woulda. 
&gt;Would have saved millions of Marks over the life of the engine.



&gt;How many out there have completely removed the thermostat and all of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;attendant paraphernalia, including the air deflectors contained inside the
&gt;&gt;&gt;fan housing?

And how many miles did you get after that? &lt;grin!&gt;

Leave it in there. It can be a pain but it has obvious value and purpose.
