ALthough a few folks have been having problems with the bus depot, i am 
interested in ordering some parts.  My question is this :
i need to order some replacement body panels.  i am not sure what the panel 
is called so i can't order it. is there a panel that is just the front part 
of the wheel skin? instead of the entire wheelskin? both areas are rotted 
through on my 70 bus. 
thanks
skye
