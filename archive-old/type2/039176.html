Subject: Re: Engine Seal Replacement

I just replaced the seal in my 76 bus, and it's not really very difficult. 
Yes, ya gotta get on your hands and knees, and maybe stand on your head in 
the engine compartment, but if you start with the middle of the foam &quot;snake&quot; 
at the middle of the firewall tin, and lead it over, under, around, and thru 
the hoses, wires, and etc., before you start filling the crack, it'll be 
okay. The foam has a slice cut down either edge, kinda like a hotdog bun, and 
you have to get the back half of the foam thru the gap in the tin, and then 
get the foam to seat properly. Once you start at the upper middle of your 
firewall, work one side, and then the other until they meet near your fan. 
Stretch it a bit as you go-mine left a three inch gap. Don't just stuff the 
foam in the gap, but kinda work it into the gap, so that the backside of the 
foam seats properly. You'll feel it sorta &quot;pop&quot; into place. This will happen 
if you poke it right in the middle of the gap. You may have to run your 
fingers down the slit on both sides to free it up, and insure that it is 
open. Mine had been slit, but sorta stuck back shut afterwards.
The foam has a coated side, and an uncoated side. I think the uncoated side 
is meant for the exterior, but most of the gunk that it will be exposed to 
will come from inside.  I installed mine coated side out, and then put duct 
tape over it near my dip stick, and oil fill tube.  
Insure that all of the old one is out first. I'm still finding pieces of my 
last one in the darndest places.  While you're in there standing on your 
head, look for holes in your tin where unknown hoses or whatchamacallits used 
to come thru. I covered these holes with metallic duct tape [made from heavy 
aluminum foil-got it from an A/C guy] Wipe the gunk off with a rag first.
My engine runs cooler, and quieter. Total time, about 15 to 20 minutes.
