Subject: [T2] RE: Pacesetter muffler

&gt; I'm building a cheap work van and am looking for a cheap muffler for
&gt; my 83 Vanagon.  Not worried about emissions.  Does Ron or Vanagain
&gt; carry Pacesetters.  I've had one of these on my 77 for over 10 years
&gt; and have had no problems.


I have the Pacesetter for $99.95.  It will fit aircooled '83 but not
watercooled.
