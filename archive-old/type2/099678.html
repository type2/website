Subject: Re: [T2] Dizzy stuff.

&gt;GE 79 2.0L engine ,36 dell's,......what distributor?
&gt;
&gt;The dells have a provision for a vacuum port, so I suppose I could go vacuum
&gt;or hybrid. I just want whatever offers the best proformance for my engine
&gt;(naturally)

I have the same engine in my Beetle and would say that the mechanical 
advance distributors would be fine EXCEPT I have tried it in my bus and 
have to say the stock vacuum advance dist. is better in the bus. Add a 
Pertronix or equivalent and enjoy.
