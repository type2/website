Volks,

Due to a close encounter of the curb kind, I finally find myself up
against the wall on tires.  I know we have had a ton of tire threads over
the years and I have ignored all of them :-)  I just went out and bought
myself new XZX's whenever I needed tires.  Well, Michelin has killed the
XZX line :-(  So now I need to get a new brand/model of tire..  Damn!!

Sooooo.....

OK, I looked...  I went to the archives (they are down, and Steve is on
the road)), I went to the library (nice page, but not what I was
looking for)...

I have started a page.  Go too:

http:///www.type2_dot_com/dworkin/tires

and take a look.  

Right now, it is a prototype.  I would love to hear any comments,
additions, deletions, etc. that would make the page useful to you in a
search for tires.  Don't submit tires for inclusion yet, first let's get
the format and content right, OK?
