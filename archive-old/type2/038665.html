Subject: Soggybus and the great Burrito Express tour

Hey y'all
Finally home and settled in after a week of camping fun and, yes indeed,
sun.  Maybe I ought to back up a bit.  We left Charleston in company
with the Full Moon Bus club about 5pm that Friday.  We were 4 busses,
Snoopy's new 21 window, Ben Gone's venerable 60 something whatever, the
Tinkertoy driven by Derek the wonderwrench and the Burrito Express out
for her debut run, loaded down with what seemed to be my entire house,
wife, 2 kids, 2 dogs and fingers crossed..

Up 176 we went, our usual off the highway back way to Columbia with CB's
joking and spirits high.  Stopped for fuel, the Burrito Express gave
24.8 mpg for the leg of the trip.  Bussed fueled and grins flashing we
got on 26 to 77 for the highway hog part of the trip.

As the sun left us the rain came along to provide company.  We didn't
care we was going camping.  Stopped for dinner at Wendy's at a well
timed fuel stop.  I was diggin' a baked potato (more 'bout taters
later). Off to Walmart because I lost a wiper blade so I bought 2.
Sunglasses to ensure we wouldn't see the sun for the rest of the
campout, and various sudries that I was told I forgot.  The last leg
down mysterious back roads and all of a sudden comes Royce's voice out
of the CB  wondering if we were there.  A bit later there we were, Chris
and DocRic slogging over to greet us.  How cool is that huh?

Camp setup in the rain, we socialized a bit and went to sleep to the
sound of rain on the Dormobile top.

Next day we woke to the sound of rain.  Made breakfast burritos (in the
rain).  Socialized, hung out, napped, socialized.  Launched a few taters
over the far treeline witht he tater cannon.  Ether is a better
propellant than propane I learned.  Had a tremendous dinner with Kudos
to the Roanoke Valley Bus folks.  Did the awards deal and then was
rousted to build another bonfire.  That was easy enough to do because
folks came out of the woodwork with wood, starter fluid, charcoal.  I
added a chunk of magnesium alloy in the form of a beat engine case.  She
burned good and bright for quite a while.  Hung out at both fires for a
while and went to bed in the rain again.

Sunday dawned clear and bright.  Made breakfast burritos for any and all
who came by to help us eat them.  Did the washing up, watched as bus
after bus departed homewards except the irish conversion bus that wasn't
going anywhere due to some badly worn valve guides.  I think he ate a
burrito too.  We took back roads home, checked out a possible site for a
Full Moon campout, and made it back before dark.

We shed out wet stuff for dry, had dinner, and talked about the rest of
the week then crashed for the night.

Monday morning we loaded the Burrito Express back up with dry clothes
and people and off we went again.  This time a solo run out of the rain
for a few days of sun in St. Augustine Beach Fl.  Sun ball shining and
spirits high we headed south.  I noticed what appeared to be a cloud of
smoke behind us.  Hmmmm.  Oil temp a little high and pressure a bit
low.  Hmmmm.  Pulled into a gas station to pee and investigate.  The
full flow filter had loosened a turn and the o-ring wouldn't seal and so
was venting about 10 lbs of pressure in the form of oil leakage.  I gave
it a turn and a half of tighten, added the quart of oil we lost, and
continued the journey.

It didn't take long for me to remember why I hate I-95.  The Burrito
Express was happy at 3500 RPM which is about 66 MPH.  That's standing
still on that piece of road.  I had a really cool ball cap with the logo
of another e-mail list I subscribe to.  It blew off my head and out the
passenger window after an 18 wheeler roared by at 90mph creating a gust
of tornadic proportions.  I wasn't about to get out of the bus and go
get it either.  After hitting Jacksonville just in time for rush hour (I
always wonder why it's called rush hour when you sit still so long) we
made it to the campground (KOA but they got pools) and set up camp.

The Dormobile is laid out pretty well.  I had already removed the fridge
because it went POP when I plugged it in the second time and used the
space it occupied for stowage of pots and pans and stuff.  We swam,
walked the beach, fried in the sun.  I pulled the 2 burner stove and
walked to the nearby appliance repair place because the burner didn't
work.  The lines were clear, orifice were clean, and the valves felt
good but it wouldn't allow the gas to flow.  The appliance place looked
at the 30 year old German valves, shook their heads, and once again I
was disappointed for trying to find the impossible.  Such is life with a
30 year old camper.  While I was at the campground, I adjusted the
valves.  #1 intake and exhaust, #3 and #4 exhaust were about .015&quot; tight
all around.  I was pleased with how well she ran so far.

Thursday morning we packed up and left.  Breakfast at that Southern
standard the Waffle House.  All y'all northerners don't know what you're
missin'.  IHOP can go take a flying leap.  Fuel added, oil checked, and
off we went for a short leg up I-95 to 295 to 1/23 to 301.   301 runs
into Ga and north.  A nice ride, I recommend it because you don't need
to be in a hurry and you don't bother those that are because there's
plenty of passing room. The Burrito Express purred like only a good
running 1776 with w\throaty exhaust can purr.  We purred through Claxton
(home of the world renowned Claxton Fruitcake Company and the Claxton
chicken farm)  Nothing smells worse than a chicken farm on a hot day.

About 1 mile from the SC border I saw a GA state police car pull a uturn
and pass the car behind us, crossing the double yellow to do so.  Sure
as dogs smell butts, on came the lights and we pulled over about a half
mile from the SC border.  This young officer trying to look straight
ahead was looking into my chest.  Swell.  Pulled over by Napoleon
wearing state cop livery.  His first words were &quot;Are you having a bad
day sir?&quot;  Couldn't help but tell him not until about 30 seconds ago.
He claimed he pulled us over because we were weaving in the lane.  I
pointed out to the lad that if he looked up at the trees he'd notice
there was about a 20 mph crosswind and the roadside alternates between
field and woods.  I asked him how old he was and he allowed how he was
27 years old.  I told him my bus was older than him then asked if he'd
ever tried to carry a sheet of plywood in the wind.  He hadn't, but I
suspect that's because he couldn't get his arms around one.  I described
what it's like to drive a bus in a crosswind while digging in the
Pringles jar and talking with your wife.  He figured he ought to run my
drivers license and see if i was wanted anywwhere.  I was having fun and
told him there was times not even my wife wanted me.  He went up and
asked Sherry the engine building wife all the same things he asked me.
She told him the same things I did with no coaching on my part and he
decided we were indeed a family out camping in a funky old VW bus.  I
told the history of the Express, described the opening of the top and
how well it was set up for camping.  I also suggested he try a bus
someday and he'll understand.  He let us go with a warning and a smile.

We crossed the border to SC and grinned that homeward stretch grin.
Until the town of Bamberg.  Where?  Right.  We stopped at a light,
started to make the right.  BAM BAM BAM BAM with each revolution of the
right rear wheel.  Freakin' swell.  Pulled into handy gas station.  Saw
another darn oil leak.  This was an easy one.  The oil filter is next to
the left valve cover.  The bail holding the cover in place had worn a
pinhole in the oil filter, creating a very small leak.  I replace the
filter and the quart that had leaked out.  I wiggled the driveshafts to
check for funky play in the CV joints that had bout 1500 miles on them
at this point.  No play noticeable.  I called Derek (remember the
wonderwrench?) who said it sounds like the tranny's about to go but baby
it and she might make it home.  OK. thanks.

Wonder of wonders, the BAM BAM BAM BAM in Bamberg went away once we hit
about 30 mph.  It manifested itself the rest of the way home as various
and sundry not so funny noises depending on the conditions the right
rear side was being subjected to at the time.  We made it though, the
aircooled gods did smile upon our asses.

I drove the Tinkertoy to work the next day.

Saturday I took the Express to see Doc Woosley the local Guru, described
the circumstances and sounds and Doc allowed how the tranny was on it's
way out.  We talked about the options and decided rebuilt was best as at
least you get some kinda warranty with a reputable builder, and he told
me to stay away from GEX which you list folks have already warned me
about.  With tears in my eyes at the thought of an even lighter wallet
we went home to tell Sherry the engine building wife the bad news.  She
took it pretty good, the black eye she gave me will fade in a couple
weeks.

Sunday I was looking at the Burrito Express.  Funny, the left rear hub
looked about the same, still had my greasy fingerprints from the brake
job.  The right side was suspiciously dry looking and there was a light
dusting of rust.  Hmmm.  I whipped out the floor jack, hoisted the right
rear and sure as it rains at a Full Moon campout the right rear has a
wobble to it.  The drum was loose on the shaft, and was loose in
relation to the big ass nut by about 3/64&quot;.  I tightened the big ass
nut, and much of the wobble went away.  Not all of it though, and when I
spin the wheel I hear the crunch grumble of dead bearings.  I KNOW I
tightened the big ass nut to Dave spec (recommended torque and an extra
quarter turn).

Looks like I'll be doing bearings next weekend.  I'll take pix and post
the procedure.  Meantime I'll be looking for a drum and spindle because
I suspect there's been some damage to the splines.  Anyone got a shaft
and drum for sale?

In all a very successful trip.  THat's what I love about busses and bus
folks is we help each other out and every trip is an adventure!

I'd rather be poor and unknown.  If I were rich the gummint
would take the rest of my money.  If I was famous, everybody'd
be digging in my business.  You don't even know my dog's name.
