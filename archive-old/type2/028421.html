How come you didnt turn the key off?
	Barry Wright

&gt; This weekend, I took my 1971 bubbletop camping up to Northern
&gt; California. While I was happily cruising _at_ 55-60 MPH, when, all
&gt; of a sudden, the bus started accelerating by itself, and there
&gt; was nothing I could do!!!
&gt; I could not get it out of gear, and braking the bus was out of
&gt; the question!! (Overheated brakes from trying to stop the bus my
&gt; brakes)  When I finally &quot;snapped&quot; it out of 4th gear, I smelled
&gt; the burnt clutch!! Pulled over to the shoulder, and shut her off.
&gt; The little spring on the carburator had snapped in two!!! The
&gt; throttle on the carburator was wide open!! I temporarily fixed it
&gt; with, believe it or not, the spring from my pen!!! I hooked it up
&gt; to the carb, and to my amazement, it worked pretty good!! Now the
&gt; bad news....the clutch was fried, but I did limp into King city
&gt; (she refused to go over 40 MPH), where there was only one garage
&gt; that could help me. They replaced the clutch, and the throw-out
&gt; bearing. The only spare clutch and throwout bearing in the whole town!!
&gt; This &quot;little&quot; incident did cost me $500.00 US!!!! They completed
&gt; the job in about 2 hours. Now my question is.....does anyone make
&gt; any &quot;lifetime&quot; springs for the carb?? Why would that little spring snap??
&gt; Thanks for all your help!!!
