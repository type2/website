Subject: Re: [T2] Removable rear aprons versus the non removable ones

My theory is that there was a change in repair philosophy with the type IV
engine.  The type I engine was repairable by just about anyone and they
made it easy to remove.  They type IV engine was a different animal, much
more reliable, and they expected it to be removed only by those with
professional equipment.
