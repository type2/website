Subject: (disregard my other post) Re: [T2] Hard start and dies when
  accelerator is pressed

Hello List,

I apologize for the ROUGH post. I hit send by accident
while trying to do spell check. I did not proof read.

&quot;runs like a top&quot; is not an actual saying....

Sorry for the sloppy grammar and spelling! Here is the
cleaned up version.

 Hello List,
 
 Well, the problem that I wrote to you about a few
 days
 ago is gone for now. I went outside this afternoon
 during twilight to see if I could figure out why I
 had
 such a hard time getting my engine to idle and
 decelerate properly. I tried cranking the engine
 again. The engine would run momentarily and then
 die.
 I grew tired of running back and forth from the
 ignition switch to the distributor trying to set the
 timing by ear. The engine died once again. Instead
 of
 going back to the front of the bus to kill the
 switch,
 I just pulled the hot wire from the coil. When I did
 this I noticed a spark from the negative terminal on
 the coil to the distributor wire connection in the
 center. Well, I connected and disconnected this hot
 wire several times and each time a spark was noted
 from the other terminal. Evidently, there is a crack
 or something in the plastic on the coil.  I swapped
 coils. After I hooked up the spare coil, the problem
 seemed to go away. I re timed it and it runs like a
 champ!
 now! It does not mis nearly as much! To think, if I
 had gone out side to work on the bus any earlier, I
 would not have seen the coil arc! I was starting to
 think I had a gremlin living in my bus! Thanks for
 all
 the replies to my question. I took your advice and
 checked everything twice. 
 
 Regards,
