Subject: luggage rack seal fit

&quot;I found the same problem with mine. To much air pushed under the luggage
rack= alot of noise and vibration when the wind is blowing just right at
the
front while driving. It also seems to push more air clear back to the
pop-top and I can feel the air leak in past the canvas. Not something I
want
this winter as that cold air falls right down on you.&quot;

I have this problem as well. I initally had no seal on my 78's luggage
rack. I put the seal on and the noise stopped. Then I replaced the rack
when I replaced the whole pop top and just transferred the seal. The noise
came back. I am going to try and loosen the screws that hold the rack to
the bus and try to adjust it closer to the roof. I may have to enlarge the
screw holes a little in the fiberglass to get the thing closer to the roof.
I thought about maybe bending the brackets a little as well but am going to
to try this route first. The problem is that the gap between the rack and
the roof is too big so the wind gets in and causes vibration. If you get
the gap close, like 1/16&quot;, of an inch you won't have any noise and it will
still drain.
