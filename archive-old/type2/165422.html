Subject: Door Seals....

Hey guys,

       I installed a set of new door seals a couple of years ago. I think they've been on the car now for 2 years with the doors shut 99.9% of the time. I still have to SLAM the door HARD in orrder to make the door shut properly. I really REALLY hate doing this because I cannot imagine that this is good for my Bus. What do I need to do to fix this? I was told by many people that the new door seals would shrink after a couple of years... however... I keep my Bus in the garage all the time. Any ideas?


Thanks!!!
