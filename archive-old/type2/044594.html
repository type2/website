Rodney,

   You should begin with adjusting the brakes all around. If this doesn't 
solve the problem the next most likely culprit would be a restricted brake 
line. I'm pretty sure the wheel cylinders were replaced already. 
  Though if driven infrequently brake fluid can do nasty things to rubber 
components, especially aftermarket rubber, which just doesn't hold up as well 
as the original stuff.
