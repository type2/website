&gt; i do not think this would ever be a drawback in the real world. It may look
&gt; this way on paper, but in reality the Mallory will do pretty much anything
&gt; you need or want it to do as far as the advance curve. The only real
&gt; shortcoming is that the vacuum advance is only tunable for amount of
&gt; advance, not when it comes in. but again, there is so much adjustability
&gt; built in to the Mallory that you will always be able to make it work near
&gt; perfect for your application.

What steps did you perform to setup the Mallory for your own bus?
