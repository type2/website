&gt;It has been my experience with 2 different VW dealers that I cannot afford them. $65+ for a set of pushrod seals that the rest of the world sells for $16 (this was 1995), and the clip that holds the timing gear on for $65+ (again!) from another dealer. Rest of the world was getting dollars rather than tens of dollars. In neither case did I see proof of their cost so I cannot comment on their cost. 

I've found that the prices even varies between dealers in the same city.

Their system provides list and net prices. I believe that last valve adjusting screws I bought were $1.99 net, $3.07 list. Finding a dealer that will sell to you at net price is difficult.
