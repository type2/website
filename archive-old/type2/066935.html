&gt; Wow, the idea of flashing your high-beams to tell them it's not safe to pass
&gt; is pretty scary, since for as long as I've driven, I've always understood
&gt; that this is a signal to say it is safe.  I only do this to big trucks
&gt; (and they often give nice signals back) and I presumed I was correct. 

Truckers use their lights as signals. Turning off the lights signals 
it's OK to pull over. High beam signals they are too close.

Having driven trucks, it's a pleasure to have someone courteous enough 
to back off and signal that they are ready.
