Hi,

Chris writes:

&gt; Okay take this one more step forward: which Type IV bus heads flowed the
&gt; best? I think I read that the '73 dual carb heads had the largest valves
of
&gt; any of the busses. Anybody think this would lead to more power? Better or
&gt; worse MPG?

 It might lead to more power, but I think VW reduced the valve size to
improve
torque.

&gt; Lastly - how wild a cam can you put with this CIS setup? I'm figuring that
&gt; the OEM fuel injection cam was pretty tame and power/mpg/driver's smile
&gt; could be improved with a slightly wilder cam. Would the GTI cam numbers
&gt; have any bearing on the cam numbers for a bus engine running CIS? I'm not
&gt; looking to ruin driveability just improve power/breathing and still be
able
&gt; to send the bus to the store with my wife.

 Again, when VW upped the size of the pancake engine they opted to improve
torque over peak power- primarily to improve driveability. If you're 
thinking that you'd like a type-4 engine with FI and better peak power then
it would be worth looking at 914/912E engines, that way all the development
work has been done for you.
 I believe CIS doesn't respond well to aggressive cam profiles on 911s, but
whether you're likely to get anywhere near that area in a bus engine I don't
know.

 This has been covered before, the archives might prove a rich source of
information.

Cheers,
	W.
