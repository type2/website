Subject: Generator/Alternator Warning light question

Hi,

My Gen Warning light hasn't ever come on with the key in the ON
position, so I figured it was burned out or disconnected somewhere
down the line. Of course I'd never go for a ride without the warning
lights all working, so I knew I'd be getting around to fixing it soon.

Strange thing is, today, after idling my bus for a short time I went
and turned off the ignition, and while the bus was running down - yup
- the warning light went on!

I guess the bulb and wiring are in part functional. Still, I'd like to
make sure the light is in working order.

Any reason the light wouldn't come on with the ignition in the ON
position but the engine not running, and then come on while the engine
is shutting off?

Thanks in advance


peace,
Jules
