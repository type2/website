Actually, JCWhipme has a great deal on their 12 ton pair (6tons/each)...30
dollars.  Of course, you get to chew with JCWs shipping, but it still
comes in WAY under the 70-80+ dollars that everyone else charges for
something this size.

I have a set of these and they are GREAT.  The heads are large enough to
sit under the rear torsion beam, and they are plenty tall for a bus, you
dont have to use them at their tip-top-peak like the smaller ones.

and SOLID, too.  15&quot; minimum, 23-1/2&quot; maximum lift....so they're a bit big
if you intend to use them on a non-bus at some point. (the quantum has to
go WAY up there to get on'm...)

The 6 ton set is 20 bucks, 11&quot; minimum, 16-1/2&quot; maximum

Built buy the same guys, and I'd suspect they're just as good.  Did I
mention solid? And heavy?  The 12 ton set are wide enough at the base to
be reasonably safe from tipping, too.   If I recall (they're 293 miles
away at the moment..) they're about 11 inches wide at the base in one
direction, about 13 in the other.  They've got all the little reinforcing
bits well-welded in, too.  And THICK steel, just shy of 1/4&quot; thick.


Anyway.  I've see the HF 12 ton stands at the local store, and they're
similar...but priced at 79 bucks!

The 6 tons that HF sells are NOT the same quality as the 12s, nor the same
as the JCW stands (&quot;Big Red&quot; brand..)...that is, the 6 tons that I looked
at at the local store.

FWIW, sears has some nice 6 tons that I just picked up, Pro series, for 24
bucks.  Solid, though the heads are a bit small if you want to hold the
bus up by the rear torsion tube...but they'd be OK.  The non-pro series 6
tons wouldnt work well at all, i dont think.


Anyway. enough babble.

If you need a jack, and you have a shop large enough to support a jack
that's over 4 feet long, get HF's 150 dollar wonder.  31 5/8 inch total
lift, from 5 and 3/4 inches...puts those little 19inchers to shame. :)

only 2.5 ton, but hey...  (mine will be here soon after harbor wait
gets it going...)
