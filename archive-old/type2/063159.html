Subject: Re: Ideas on a noisy diff?

Steve Junor asked:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Ive recently had the transmission re-done on my '65 kombi by a
&gt;&gt;reputable shop here in Sydney. It now works like a dream, no more
&gt;&gt;popping out of gear, crunching of gears etc.etc. BUT - it's come back
&gt;&gt;from the shop quite noisy.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;It always had a whine at the end of 3rd and all of 4th, but it's worse
&gt;&gt;now. I'm pretty sure it's the crown/pinion which they didn't replace.
&gt;&gt;When I asked the guy he said that he noticed they weren't in the right
&gt;&gt;position before so he &quot;fixed it&quot; - whatever that means.

Glad you asked this Steve -- I was just going to ask the same thing. Just
installed a rebuilt 70 Beetle box in my 63 Dormobile (with 12volt 1600 SP
engine). When I picked it up at the shop, the guys said they can't get
parts any more so any gears which needed replacing would be taken from a
used box.  They said it might be noisy, which they would not regard as
reason to replace the tranny under guarantee, but they guaranteed it
wouldn't break even if it were noisy.

Of course, it is very noisy. I think it is the crownwheel and pinion as the
whine is speed rather than gear related. Whines in 3rd and 4th from about
65km/h to 80km/h under load. I'm used to VW trannies whining but I think
this is too much. What causes the whine if all bearings are new and the
crownwheel and pinion are still good (as claimed by the rebuilders)? Should
I take it back and say I'm not prepared to put up with the noise?

BTW, these guys are THE experts in the whole country on rebuilding VW
gearboxes. My experience with them in the past has been very good, with
them taking on guarantee claims without question. Only now they've told me
that noise is no longer a possible guarantee claim. I'm not sure that I can
put up with such loud whining, and of course it would be at the most common
driving speeds.

Will appreciate any advice.
