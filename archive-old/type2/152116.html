&gt; Seatbelts were required starting in 1967 nationwide. I know my '65 Beetle and '64 1/2 Moostang and '65 Corvair all had the captive nuts installed in the body - all you had to do was add the bolt and the belts.

from the dim dark recesses of my memory I seem to recall my 65 Westy had
lapbelts and that I was able to install belts without much hassle in my 60
23window deluxe.
