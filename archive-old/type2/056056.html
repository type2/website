Subject: Pertronix Ignitor and Hot coil

I installed a ignitor in my '73 bus.  Just put a new engine in.  I thought
that I labeled all the connections correctly when I took it all apart but
I am having some problems.  Turning the key and holding the spark plug
near the engine I get a fat spark at least.  But with the ignition on the
coil which is just a stock one, rapidly heats up to where I can't even
touch it.  Also my oil pressure warning light doesn't seem to work anymore
and neither does my windshield wipers but that may be unrelated.  Any
ideas about the hot coil?
