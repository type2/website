John is dead on, but I'll mention, if you only intend to paint/buff one or two
cars, the WEN sander of the same ilk is about $50 from Harbor Freight.  It
is a cheap piece of crap, but I paid $35 for mine 10 years ago and it was
still
going fine until I used it on a bunch of ceramic tile this year and sucked so
much abrasive into it that it gave it up for good.  I had dissasemlbed and
cleaned
it a few times though before, but for $50 it would probably strip a van to
bare
metal and buff more than a few vans later.  A good Makita, Milwalkee, etc is
around $200 but you might even touch a nonadjustable spped one for $150
from Harbor or another tool catalog if you watch for sales, or check the Black
and Decker outlets for something of theirs.  Of course as I've mentioned, I'd
never take a van to bare metal unless I felt crazy, maybe a really crazed roof
but not otherwise.  Getting it back on to last as well as origional is a time
consuming job and requires nice facilities and a fair investment (I'd guess at
least $500) in material (paint) alone let alone sanding supplies and other
consumables.  Last summer I did a friends '69 Vette, we were $750 into just
material and paper for medium/high end PPG stuff.
