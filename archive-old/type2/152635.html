BJ Clark-
I'm not sure that is the engine that is supposed to be in the 76 (there never
was a &quot;single carb&quot; type IV) but if it is a type IV it should fit. The single
carb setup is an after market rig but your carbs should also fit. If it is a
2L
engine the carb linkage might not reach accross.  The 2L is wider than the
1700/1800 (I think).

Subject: '76 Camper 1800cc to '72 Transporter?
Message-ID: &lt;bc9da621050714162868b3bcfb_at_mail.gmail_dot_com&gt;

Dear Guru's,
In searching my local area for a used type 4 engine, I've found a '76
camper for sale. It has a 1800cc single carb (but is missing the carb,
but everything else is great). I've got a seized '72 1700cc with dual
carbs. The guy wants $350 for the engine or $500 for the car. In the
short term, I'd like to take the engine out of the '76, slap my carbs
from my 1700 on it and put it back in the '72.  Is there any reason
this won't work? They seem to be almost identical.

Thanks oh wise sages. . .
