Subject: Re: [T2] HElla Relay Wiring Schematic / Diagram

From DrBen VW:

My friend and I each got the Hella relay kit from Ron at BD for setting
 up a second battery to run the inverter and 12 volt stuff in our 78 Westy;s,

This weekend we wanted to set them up.  I bought wire, terminals clips
 etc and opened the bag.  The instructions only show how to wire it to a
 trailer plug!  I am using it to charge an auxiliary marine deep cycle
 second battery.

A relay is a relay is a relay. Some have 3 connections, some 4, some 5.
[ok the FI double relays have 9 and 11 depending on the year]
Relays are marked either with the circuits that go thru them or in GM's wisdom, 1,2,3,4, etc.
99.9% of the Euro relays out there are marked with the circuit numbering system. This makes them real easy to 
figure.

What are the numbers on your relay?
