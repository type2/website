Subject: RE: [T2] Megasquirt.

Chris-

It's a real pain in the ass.  Not as bad if you have an understanding of
electronic circuits.  You'd better be good at soldering small electronic
components as well.  Mostly the building of the circuit board and wiring
harness are the tedious parts.  Another issue is getting a good tach
signal to the board so the injectors fire correctly.  Connecting to the
negative side of the coil is not a very reliable method.  I ended up
switching to electronic ignition and using the square wave tach signal
from that.  I also mounted a mini case computer inside the bus with a
small flatscreen below the E-brake so I can tune the engine on the road
if I want.  Not that I ever do but it's pretty cool to monitor engine
parameters (temp, rpm, vacuum, air flow, injector pulse time, etc.)

Time for me to build:
Circuitboards- approx 12 hours assembly time
Wiring harness mods- approx 4 hours
Tuning and cussing-  approx 6 hours

Once it is assembled and running it's like a dream.  No more adjusting
carbs or AFM's.  The 02 sensor keeps everything in check and tuned like
a clockwork.  Combine Megasquirt with electronic ignition and you're
pretty much running on new car technology.
Let me know if there are any other questions.
