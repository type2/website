&gt; I have one of these on an engine I've just aquired and what wondering what
&gt; it is.  (Any idea what the engine came from? It's what's in my new '69, an
&gt; AH engine...)

Some sort of EGR add-on?  It appears to feed into the manifold just below
the carburator and have a valve to control flow.

That is one heck of &quot;Sherman-Williams Refurbishment&quot; on that manifold!
Look at the severe rust pitting on the heat riser under the pretty silver
paint!

Ah, well, the seller says that he's buying a GEX 1800cc engine.  What goes
around comes around...
