Subject: Re: [T2]76 Shiftrod no reverse

ok so went back out and did the trick in the bentley with the screw driver etc and was able to get the shift rod better up and down and set right.... it was way to close ot the drivers seat...
i am able to get it into third and fourth now but.... no reverse still.... hoping that the stop plate being broken in that one place could be all the difference....
so when i find one of those i will maybe be set...
the rear coupler etc will have to be another day but at least i have the part when that time comes...
 
also when i make it into fourth it seem that the shifter i can turn all the way almost like its spining around on threads like the shift nob is... can this be something wrong with the bottom of my shifter itself maybe the key isnt working right causing it to spin around???? very curious about this...or could this also be some fault of the broken cracked shift stop plate..?
 
thanks
cha
