[note: this is pure speculation]
In my current bus when I pulled the heads &amp; replaced the rings I did
the same thing by replacing (with new) the gasket thingies. That being
said I suspect the removal was more of a decision by VW to try and
elimintate a problem. Of the 3 bus engines I have been into all 3 of
them had the gaskets, but all were of somewhat scary shape[0]. On one
cylinder each of the engines had deformed the gasket so much that it
was very close to causing a breech in the combustion chamber by
becoming elongated. Now this may have happened a looooong time ago so
that it wouldn't move any more &amp; was set, or it could have been a
recent shift in the gasket. Hard to tell. But I can say that based on
this gasket (which is the sealing surface in these heads) moving
around &amp; deforming I am very warry with putting them in my rebuild
when done next month.

Another possibility of the bulletin is that machanics who didn't know
better were in fact not putting the gaskets back in there &amp; causing a
rise in CR &amp; heat temps. This is a real shaky theory since a mechanic
in question would have to know to put the spacers under the cylinders
to make up the difference. Otherwise he could just say &quot;Shoot Skeeter,
these durn Veeedubbas ain't supposed to have gaskets, toss that
out&quot;[1]

The third thing I can reason on VW's reversal of this part would be
that the installation of these didn't always happen correctly. This
might account for the deformaties I saw in the engines I saw and
suggest that it isn't a design issue, but an installation issue.

But anyway, I will not be replacing mine. Although I really cannot see
any problem with still using them, (they are still available). 


[0] I'll see if I took any pics of them &amp; post if I find them.

[1] I'm from the south so I get to use stereotypes of myself :)
