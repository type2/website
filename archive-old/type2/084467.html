Subject: Ignition switch &amp; Tach

I have two question.  First - my ingnition switch is not working correctly, I think.  Heres what happens.  I turn the key and sometimes it will start.  Most of the time I have to wiggle the key to get it to start.  I have a used one from my 77' parts bus but i dont know how to remove it.   I need some information on how to remove and install my ingnition switch and related parts.  Second - I purchased a Tach,not VW at a yard sale for 2 bucks.  I want to install it in my 78 sunroof bus.  But i do not know how.  Can somebody help.  I can email pics to show you what it looks like Thanks.   mike
