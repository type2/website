&gt; I heard a story several years ago that Bill Gates bought a brand

&gt; rich.  Of course it leaked oil and he never checked it.  He  drove  
&gt; it down to San Francisco to a meeting and burned up the  motor.   
&gt; When they told him what the problem was, he just traded it  in on  
&gt; another one.

(I know it's not friday but) does this man look like he has the  
ability to check oil?
