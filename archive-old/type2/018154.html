Mike said:

&gt;with an &quot;empty&quot; oil pump, it may take a longer time
&gt;to get oil up the tube because the pump won't form
&gt;a good enough vacuum with only air in there.

  which I thought was understandable, but then Bob said:

&gt;Without packing the pump, you are relying on only the
&gt;close running tolerances of the pump elements to
&gt;initially pump &quot;whatever&quot; to create this required
&gt;pressure drop on the inlet side.

  with respect to the &quot;pumpage&quot; of &quot;whatever&quot;.

FWIW, I pack the pump with grease, and I always thought I was doing it
for the reason described by Mike!  Geeez, I learn something new every
day - I think (?).
