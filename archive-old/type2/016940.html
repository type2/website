Subject: RE: carb bushings

Jack,

I don't have experience with the dual Kadrons, although I think people
like them. They sound similar to the Solex 32-34PDSIT that came on my
'73. They too had worn throttle shafts, as do most of the donor-carbs
I've found for parts to rebuild them.

You refer to the replacement throttle plates as &quot;new&quot;, so I assume they
were &quot;good&quot; used parts. If they were really new and they're less than a
year old, I would try to get compensated for the failure, unless they
were cheap enough to write off. 

I had a former listee start rebushing mine, and after several months of
aggravation and mutilation I got them back and decided to finish the job
myself. I was able to find bronze bushing stock at Eagle Hardware with
an outside diameter small enough to fit the throttle plates after
drilling, but an inside diameter smaller than the throttle shaft.

My throttle shafts were worn enough that I wasn't confident that they
would seal in the new bushings, so I turned them down to 5/16&quot; on my
Shopsmith (wood lathe) with a flat file. I used a VW Type1 fuel pump
push rod as an alignment tool on the Shopsmith set up as a drill press,
clamped the throttle plate securely so as to make sure the new hole was
centered the same place as the old hole, and bored the throttle plate
for the bronze bushings (3/8&quot;, if I remember right).

I then removed the throttle plate, pressed in the bushings, realigned
and clamped it on the drill press. I drilled it just undersize, and
bought a 5/16&quot; machinist's reamer, and reamed it (still clamped tightly
on the drill press).

When I was done with this experiment, the throttle shaft fits snug w/o
binding (must have drilled straight :). I'm finishing up the engine
assy, so I haven't run it yet.

This is probably more work than you want to get into, but someone might.
Next time, I will probably send it to Rimco (or similar), but I would
give specific instructions to check the throttle shafts as well as the
bushings.

&gt; A year ago,  I was set back about a month for the same problem.  That time, 
&gt; I found a source of just the throttle plate assemblies.  Now even these 
&gt; &quot;new&quot; ones seem to be leaking. 
&gt;   
&gt; In addition to my venting here,  I do have a few questions: 
&gt;          1. Has anyone experienced continuing intake leaks through these shafts? 
&gt;          2. If I find a shop to rebush these, can I count on the fix lasting 
&gt; more than a few months? 
&gt;          3.  Could my symptoms be caused by something other than the shaft 
&gt; bushing.
