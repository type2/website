Subject: Re: cheap headliner fix

Don't know what kind of headliner you have. Our '81 Westy has the
vinyl &quot;Contact&quot; paper over wood. The adhesive had degenerated, and the
vinyl was hanging off the headliner. I used &quot;Bestine&quot; brand rubber
cement solvent to get the vinyl off. Then sealed the wood with &quot;Kilz&quot;
latex sealer, because there was still adhesive on the wood. Got latex
paint matched to the vinyl, and painted the wood. Looks just like it
still has the vinyl paper, because the adhesive still had the imprint
of the vinyl paper in it. Did this 3 years ago, and it still looks
great. Cost, under $30 for everything.
