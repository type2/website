Subject: Re: [T2] Any spare westy stuff going ?

In case you haven't already done the research I can save you some
headaches by pointing you at www.ablecargo_dot_com. We shipped 2 Ghias from
Baltimore to Bremerhaven in June to participate in the 50th Birthday of
the Karmann Ghia celebrations and after spending a lot of time talking
with various companies about shipping containers and blocking issues we
came across Able Cargo. Able specializes in shipping cars and household
items for American servicemen and made the whole process comparatively
painless for us with what's called RoRo (roll on/roll off). A few things
to be aware of:
1. You need to get the vehicle to the docks a minimum of 3 business days
before the ship sails for customs.
2. The shipping paperwork and fees have to be paid before you get there.
3. Plan to get to the docks early in the morning or wait until after 1:30
because lunch time is really long and there is not much in the way of food
nearby.
4. Know that there are also several hundred dollars in fees due at the
other end to pay the dockworkers there for their effort.
5. Leave at least a couple gallons in the tank but not over 1/4 tank of
gas.

If you come up with questions don't be afraid to ask me.

&gt; Updating the status of the transaction, I have the money from you.  The
 title is with the bus here in Virginia at Victor's friend's place along
 with the bus.  I will be going out to exchange the money for the title
 tomorrow night.  At that point all that remains is to get the bus up to
 Baltimore and onto the ship.  Because of work, that will probably happen
 on 09/02 (here) or 02/09 (there).  In the mean time I need to research
 towing, shipping documents, and any U.S. Customs forms that are required.
 I also need to look the bus over with an eye to removing any protruding
 items (mirrors, mostly).
