&lt;&lt;The VW's oiling system is based on pressure, NOT TEMPERATURE. if you
run a too-heavy oil in there, pressure will be fantastic, but the engine
will &quot;think&quot; the oil is too cold and will bypass the oil cooler. Guess
what happens to your oil temps?&gt;&gt; 

Really?
 
So when your blasting down the asphalt ribbon at 65 mph, on a 100 degree
day into a headwind laboring the engine, there isn't any thermal
breakdown of the viscosity ?
Your 15 /50 is more than likely 10/40 at that point.
Any pressurized oiling system will go to by pass when the engine is
really cold regardless what king of oil you running---

&lt;&lt;After all, if you run 0 clearance on your bearings, the oil pressure
will be incredible, until the journal burns from overheating (oil
removes the heat too, it's not just a lubricant).&gt;&gt;

If your engine was running 0 clearance on all of the bearing surfaces it
wouldn't turn over---
 
&lt;&lt;Most (not all) VW owners are ignorant about the way the VW engine
TRULY operates, and if someone tells you to run straight weights, they
better have a real good reason.&gt;&gt;

Funny thing---
on page 52 of my 1974 VW owner's manual is mentions;

Tropical Climate---

Hot season--SAE 40

Cool season--SAE 30

Moderate Climate--

Summer--SAE 30

Winter-above 5 degree--SAE 20w 20

At average outside temps not lower than -13 degree's---SAE 10

&lt;&lt;The FACTORY recommends multigrade's--&gt;&gt;

I must have been reading a Citron owner's manual here----or somehow the
factory owner's manual I have must be a           misprint.

ALL (not some) air cooled industrial engine malefactors insist on
straight weight oils for maximum engine longevity----
Why?
Because air cooled engines inherently run much hotter than liquid
cooled, and the thermal breakdown  and the drop of viscosity at high
temps short live the engines-- 
This is a known and accepted fact of life.

Same with air cooled bike engines--they run HOT and benifit from the
vicosity holding benifits of straight weight oil.


Multi grade oils were developed for Joe Q. Average who is too lazy to
swap to a different weight for temperature differences, and was finding
that his engine with the 40 weight in it wouldn't spin at -20
degree's--because he forgot to change the oil.

It's a convenience that's all-
