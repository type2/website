Hey y'all
Today we are heading out in the Burrito Express for 10 days of forced 
togetherness (I mean vacation).  It's not a complete vacation since my 
ulterrior motive is job and house hunting.  We'll be leaving Charleston, 
proceeding up 176 to 26 to 77 to 81 and north to Martinsburg Wv.  We'll be 
camping at the Harpers Ferry KOA (has pool for kids) if any listees in the 
area care to drop by for an evening.

If you see an off white Dormobile heading that way, wave at us, please use 
all your fingers though!

Hope to see many of you at High Country Bus Fest.  This year will be 
especially good since the Full Moon Bus Club is making breakfast Saturday!

Mad Uncle Dave
