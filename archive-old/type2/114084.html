Subject: Re: [T2] burned...

&gt;Actually I was serious about the two guys askin'... Not at
&gt;all serious about the oregano...IIRC, it was in NY (with its
&gt;Draconian Rockefeller drug laws) that a few people got sent
&gt;up the river for doing exactly that to a couple of undercover
&gt;cops... ;-(

Laws against selling Oregano??? Dang! I need to go home and flush the 
toilet a few times!!!
