Subject: Again: please help me understand brake calipers on early 71

Murphy hit me twice this past week !

First I got the wrong caliper (73 and up instead of 71-72) from bus depot, 
got frustrated over the week end since I wanted to install it and ride. USPS 
shipping to return it : 21$ for 7 days (Bus Depot will pay though).

Yesterday I ordered the caliper locally at a Kragen FLAPS which got me the 
part today in the afternoon. I left work real early, hoping to install it 
and load my friends in the van to head up to Mardi Gras.

But Murphy decided to screw up with my life. Or I got it all wrong.

To make a long story short, the Kragen caliper (Cardone 19453) was a left 
core from early 71: the single bleeder screw would be at the bottom if 
mounted on the right. However the pistons were positioned to make a right 
caliper (cutouts at the bottom).

The Kragen guy told me that it doesn't matter where the bleeder screw is. He 
said it is fine if it is at the bottom. I looked at all the pictures in the 
Bentley and did not find one where there is only one bleeder screw and it is 
at the bottom of the caliper. A bleeding screw at the bottom sounds like a 
heresy to me. I refused to buy that caliper and had the same part ordered 
again. I'll see tomorrow if I get the same

When the heck will I be eligible to purchase and install a properly rebuilt 
caliper ?

The good news is that someone parked a red Karman Ghia from Ohio in front of 
my house. I was going to park my van next to it and take a picture but then 
I remembered it has no brakes so it should stay where it is.
