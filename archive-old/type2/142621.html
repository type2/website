Subject: NO BRAKES! followup followup

I just got off the phone with my FLVWM (friendly local VM mechanic).  
As I suspected, I have the wrong caliper (single bleeder nipple at the 
bottom), so I am gonna swap it out and put the old one back on there 
(I'm not so sure that it is the culprit any more - I don't think it is 
sticking).

He doesn't think it is the MC, but since I have replaced almost every 
part of the brake system except for the MC, I really can't go wrong 
getting a new one.  Besides, the operation of the brake pedal is not 
smooth (and I've lubricated everything I can see), so I think the 
problem there is with the piston(s) in the master cylinder.  He said if 
a master cylinder does go bad, it will usually be because it is leaking 
out the back, but he did concur the it might be leaking out the front 
into the booster and not be noticed.
