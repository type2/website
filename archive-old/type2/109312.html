We might just get one so that we can start restoring my wife's Beetle.

Yup, isn't it funny how in order to restore one rig, you have to get another
so you can do it?
My 1970 Beetle needs restoring/updating--new paint, upholstery, etc, stuff I
could not do till I got another rig. So I got the Bus, which has had needs,
and that has to come first right now. When the Bus is done, then it will be
the Beetle's turn.
Still Friday where I live.
