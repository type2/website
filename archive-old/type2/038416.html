If you use 7.5 BTDC with that unit, let us know how long before you put a
hole in your piston. I put my $ on less than 5K miles.
Sorry for the 3 posts volks'.

&gt; hello all,
&gt;
&gt; I have been doing some research on how to time a 71 bus distributor with
&gt; just the advance hooked up.  I cannot find the reference that said using
&gt; 7.5 btdc is kosher.  Mainly i was looking for my own curiosity as i cannot
&gt; remeber if that timing should be static or at idle...
