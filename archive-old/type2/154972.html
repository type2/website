Subject: Fire recovery &amp; warning to NoCal and Oregon

I replaced the crumbly sound dampening stuff in my '79 with the front hood liner from a salvage yard BMW. It's made to be above an engine and from Germany. I guess a water pumping VW would have the same stuff. 

Look for a clean engine, the liner will probably be clean too. Use stiff hardware cloth to hold it up! 

Remember to grab some nice hose clamps while you're there.
