The engine of Subaru is not made in China.(Joke?) It is made in Japan. The S
ubaru automobile industry made it.  Not manufactured by kawasaki. There is n
o even engine of bike again. It is the engine of the car purely.
Long ago, I had Subaru360. There were four kinds of types of sedan, estate,
van, truck in it. Bore up was done with the engine of the later type to 600cc.
Then, 5 speed gear box was attached, too. But, this type may not have been d
one the export.

Thanks,
