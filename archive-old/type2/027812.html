Hi,

I have a 1600 dualport.  on my way to work this morning I kept hearing this 
loud popping.  Which I was hoping something was just attached to the tire 
and was hitting the wheel well. Metal against metal.  Welp, I looked when I 
arrived at work and the whole valve cover on the passenger side is coated 
with fresh clean oil.  So, i'm assuming a rocker arm (is that what its 
called) popped off or a spring broke in there.  I have to still pop it off 
and confirm.  Do you think there is a way to rig it to at least get me home? 
  its 11 miles.

After I look at it at lunch i'll post what I find.
