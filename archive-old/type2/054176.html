Subject: Re: a note on replacing the fuel tank sender

I have a similar hole that was cut into mine before I got it. I always
considered it a dangerous operation - sparks, gas fumes, and a tank of
gas......Did make replacing the sender easier.

Mine had more of a flap to it which can be bent back in place. Its got
silicone sealing the seam.Its a real eye sore.  How did you put yours back
in place?

&gt; Dear Volks,
&gt;
&gt; The '74-'79 VW bus shop manual
&gt; (http://www.simplecom_dot_net/dakhlia/images/VW-90.4.jpg) shows how you can
cut
&gt; into the rear deck for direct access to the fuel tank sender. (Yes, it's a
&gt; trade-off, but I wasn't going to pull the engine to pull the firewall to
&gt; pull the tank, which, knowing myself, would have lead to a complete engine
&gt; rebuild. :)  The key, I think, is in doing a *neat*, clean job.)
&gt;
&gt; For the record, I just wanted to point out three things:
&gt;
&gt; (1) The &quot;lid&quot; part of the '73-'79 sender has a 3-5/8&quot; diameter, hence will
&gt; not fit through the hole if it is cut to the smaller dimensions given in
the
&gt; manual. (This also means that the non-availability of the VW cover plate
&gt; shown in the manual is irrelevant to '73-'79 busses.) I went ahead and cut
a
&gt; 3&quot; x 4&quot; rectangle.
&gt;
&gt; (2) There is a fair amount of room between the rear deck and the sender,
&gt; thus allowing the use of an electric saber saw (set to medium speed) to
cut
&gt; the hole without cutting into the fuel tank, too. Obviously you must use a
&gt; short blade for metal. For easy gliding of the saber saw, I oiled the deck
&gt; surface. The oil will also help cool the blade, prolong its life, as well
as
&gt; bind the small metal particles.
&gt;
&gt; (3) Finally use a vacuum cleaner to remove shavings and most of 20+ years
&gt; worth of dirt sitting on the tank and sender. Wipe everything clean with a
&gt; wet rag. Now you can remove the old sender and install the new one.
