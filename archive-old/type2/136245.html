Subject: Re: [T2] 1971 Buying advice

Sid,

I'd say that 1971 is arguably the best year if you're into things simple,
practical, and economical.  I'm biased, though, because I drive a 1971.


Advantages...

Safety:
This is the first year that has power disc brakes in front.

Lowest cost, best parts availability:
This is the last year that uses an upright engine, and the only year that came
from the factory with the 1600 Dual Port engine.  Because this engine was used
many years of Beetles, including the famous Mexican Beetle that was sold new
until a year or two ago, it is the only Bus engine that can still be bought
factory-new.  It is also the easiest and cheapest Bus engine to get new parts
for.  This engine is powerful enough to keep up with truck traffic (but not
car traffic) on the freeway, and it uses less fuel than the later-model Type 4
engines that produce more power.  (Mine gets around 20 mpg, whereas folks with
type 4 engines seem to toss around figures like 15-18 mpg.  It all depends, of
course!)

Simplicity:
No complicated dual carbs, no complicated fuel injection.  Like the engine,
the carburetor is still available factory-new at decent prices.  The more
complicated later-model fuel systems might give you better power.  For me,
simplicity is parmount, and I really don't care about extra power.


Disadvantages...

Less power and speed than later models:
Expect to drive up hills at the same speeds as heavily loaded trucks.  Any
significant hill puts you at 40 mph in 3rd gear, and really steep ones put you
at 25 mph in 2nd gear.

Engine longevity:
The Type 1 1600DP engine is less expensive than the Type 4 engines, but also
has a shorter lifespan.  It typically lasts from 60,000 to 90,000 miles,
whereas some listmembers have Type 4 engines that have driven 200,000+ miles.
I believe that it is possible to extend the life of a new Type 1 engine by
adding an oil filter, using synthetic oil, cruising at 55-60 mph, etc.  I'm
trying all of these things, but unfortunately, it will take a long time for me
to deliver the results of my test.  Check back with me in 10 years and see how
many miles I've managed to put on the engine that I bought new in 2002. :-)

Generator:
If your luck with generators is as bad as mine, you'll need to replace the
stock generator with a new Bosch alternator.  I do not recommend replacing a
bad generator with a rebuilt generator.  Others' advice may differ, but I say
don't even go there.


Summary...

If you value the advantages that I listed and don't mind the disadvantages, by
all means, you should buy a '71!  Otherwise, buy a different year.  Other list
members' opinions may vary, and of course, no matter what year you buy, you're
in for a lot of learning, a lot of work, and a lot of fun too.  My Bus was a
royal pain when I first bought it, but it's been very good, reliable
transportation since I got the bugs worked out of it and learned to carry all
of my tools and spare parts under the bed in back.  I really appreciate the
feeling that if something goes wrong while I'm on the road, I stand a decent
chance of fixing it right then and there.

Cheers!  Enjoy your new Bus!

- Miles
