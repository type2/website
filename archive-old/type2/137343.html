Subject: Plasma Cutter parts??

I just picked up a plasma cutter and I need to verify that it works. I need to
replace the nozzle and electrode. Can anyone point me in the direction of a
company that sells these parts by the single unit? It is a snap on YA2225. I
found the parts on the web, but they are in bulk of 25 or more. I just want to
verify it is working before I drop any money into it.

This should help get that bus back into shape :)

Thanks,
Corbett
