Subject: To Seal or Not to Seal

Seems to me that the solution to this question is for someone
who has an oil temp. gauge to run with the sealing tin and then
run without the sealing tin (same fuel/air mixture, same timing,
etc) and record the results and let us know.  I always thought 
it was carved in stone 'Thou Shalt Keep All Engine Compartment Seals
In Place', and now it has become questionable.  Just goes to show
that nothing about these air cooled VW's is an absolute.  Anyone want
to run the 'with tin/without tin' and let us know (I don't have oil
temp. gauges yet)??
