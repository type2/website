Subject: Re: [T2] Steering column to floor part??

What it looks like is the 211 415 597 Insulating Washer that goes on the top
of the Steering Lock Pod the Column goes through. These are utilized on
68-Early 74 (To Vin 2x4 2164 059). The cutouts on the &quot;bracket&quot; in the photo
match Item #11 in Illustration 38-00 in the Type 2 Parts Catalog in ETKA. I
double checked the illustration in my 74 Type Parts book and 1981 dated
fiche and come up with the same things as well. But I could be entirely
wrong.
 211 415 601B is not a valid number that I can source. 211 415 601E or F are
valid numbers and that's the bottom bracket for the above mentioned Steering
Lock Pod, also used through Early 74 (See Item #13/16 in ETKA or in a parts
book/fiche).
 Hey Ron - Any enlightenment?

&gt; What is this part?

&gt; I can't seem to locate it in the Bentley and I'm pretty sure the
&gt; steering column to floor area of my bus doesn't have one. 78 Westy 2.0
