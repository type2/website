    First, make sure that's what is wrong. The third arm (swing arm) bearings and
pin often wear and that is where I'd look first.(Incidentally, this zerk needs to
be greased every oil change!)
    Actually all parts, like the tie rod ends and drag link, as well as the ball
joints, can wear and show up as looseness in the steeering feel.
    A helper is necessary to really find the loosness.
Have them wag the steering wheel, only taking up the slack, back and forth.
YOU get underrneath and see if you can feel any slack in ANY piece.
    Often, a good front end shop will do this free of charge, just to determine
what it will cost to put things right. Mine is happy to have me do the dirty part
(changing the rusty, worn parts), while they make the easy money setting the
camber and the toe!)
    In about 200k miles of driving 68-71's I've never sprung for a new box, but
have changed a few from bus to bus. My 69 double cab is now using the one that was
in my 70 for several years.
    If you've checked every other place first, then maybe you'll have to replace
the box.
At one time, the roller peg could be bought from VW, and that was the main part
that wore inside the box. Fixing a steering box is not all that hard, if you can
get the parts.
Also, make sure you don't set the lash too tight, if trying to tighten up the
steering box. Bentley and the factory manual have the specs. I've tried to set
them a few times and sometimes made it worse! but it seems like you could mark the
specific point and go back if it didn't help!

&gt; Greetings to the List,
&gt;
&gt; I have a 1970 Transporter and I am experiencing a little problem with the
&gt; steering.  It seems to have a small &quot;dead spot&quot; in the center of the steering
&gt; arc.
