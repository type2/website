Hi Don,

It's not really much of a spectator sport. But if you're ever in the 
neighborhood I'd be happy to demonstrate.

&gt; Can't say I've ever driven clutchless. I freak out when my 3rd gear
&gt; grinds going in with the clutch working!

It can be done -- practice helps. I drove large 10-speed diesel trucks 
for a living a couple decades back. One truck I used to drive had a 
first gear so low it could be engaged without the clutch from a dead 
stop if the engine was idling.

&gt; How do you start in gear??? Let the bus roll while you're turning the 
&gt; starter?
Yup. It requires a strong starter and a lot of desperation. Don't even 
bother trying if you're facing uphill. It lurches and stutters enough 
as it is.

Happy trails,
