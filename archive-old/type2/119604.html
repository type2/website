Subject: Re: [T2] heater cables question

&gt;Do you know which cable goes to the passenger heater box and which cable 
&gt;goes to the driver's heater box?  One cable has a bend it in, and the 
&gt;other has a loop.  Also, which lever do they work off of (right or left)?

Very good question. I'll have to look tonight to be sure. In case now is really important try this - - I can explain it this way: The heater box cables connecto the lever that controls the heat quantity. I think that is the right (as opposed to left) one, it's only been a couple years since I took mine apart. To double check - it is the lever with the contact switch connected to it. If you move one of those levers all the way down, the aux fan will come on with the ignition on. There is also a small diagram under the levers that tells the story too. The diagram is supposed to show how to get full defrost. 

&gt;Do you know what lever that hooks up to?

The opposite lever from the on/off lever for the heat as described above. 

&gt; Lastly - and this is another one I need - there is a cable that goes
&gt; to a flapper box located in the first crossmember behind the front

Does that cable hook up to the same lever as the one above?
Yeah. The two cbles that control the direction of the heat - to the rear passenger area, defroster, floor control, all connect to the same lever. 

Like I said - it's been a couple years since I tore mine down. I am going to do this very project this next week on my bus so this is a great discussion for me...
