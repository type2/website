&gt; The short version:
&gt; Bus (1970 Westy) ran fine until I got to South Georgia, where it simply

&gt; end of the scale.
&gt; ... So I shove in the clutch to see if varying the engine RPM will make
&gt; any difference. I manage to let it idle once, rev it up again, when the

&gt; through the carb. Spins fine.

I don't think that this failure could be caused by high oil pressure.  My
gut feeling is that you have an electrical problem.  Have you checked for
spark yet?
