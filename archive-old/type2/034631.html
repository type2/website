Subject: Free Air Conditioner Parts

Free of charge to a good home: one made-for-Volkswagen DBD under-dash air
conditioner along with the under floor condenser unit and hoses (no
compressor).  Should fit any bay window.

The under-dash unit is in the way and has been reinstalled for the last
time.  The next time it comes off it is going to another list member, or to
the scrap heap.

I will gladly deliver to any list member who is (a) willing to help take
the parts off and (b) along any of the routes I will travel this year in
Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Alabama or Mississippi.  Please pmail
if interested.
