Jack:

Our books don't show an &quot;E&quot; bearing.  It could be a supercession.  A
311-405-625 is an inner front wheel bearing for a Bug from 1966 to early
1968.  A 311-405-625B is fits a Bug from late 1968 to 1979.

Thank you!

 A neighbor was nice enough to bring me the remnants of his stash of ac
 parts.  Among these was a wheel bearing with 311-405-625E written on the
 package. I've looked through RMMW catalog but could not find an E earing.
 How does one go about reverse identifying such a part?
 Thanks, Jack
