I don't think so. First, there is no evidence, at all, that the front has
been changed out. And the fact that the column and bracket match other '69s
leads me to believe these are right. The holes through the bracket that are
supposed to match up with the dash  - don't.

So, given this process of elimination (and the fact that it was kluged
together with a block of wood and some bolts when I got it) lead me to
believe that we have a non-69 dash. If the front were changed out, it might
change the forward/back location of the holes, but the holes in the bracket
are too close together side to side to match the holes in the dash. About
3/4&quot; off on either side.

Granted, I have no clue as to WHY someone would have changed out the dash,
but there it is...

I think it is more likely that the nose of the bus was re-clipped with a
newer one, than the dash changed.

Subject: The mystery deepens...


&gt; Well, I ran Suegro down to VW Bus Heaven yesterday. The folks down there
are
&gt; great, with plenty of knowledge to go around.
&gt;
&gt; I was looking (I thought) for the steering column bracket for Suegro, a
'69
&gt; Westy (I thought) hardtop.
&gt;
 It's the dash. At some point, someone
&gt; swapped out the dash for a newer one. So now I'm in search of a dash for a
&gt; '69.
&gt;
&gt; Also,
&gt; So, the questions begin:
&gt;
&gt; 1. Anyone have a lead on a '69 dash?
&gt;
&gt; 2. Any guesses as to how this bus
