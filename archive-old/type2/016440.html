Jack:

I use a generic stand, and it's worked fine for me.  The only drawback
is that you can't work on the flywheel end of the crankshaft with the
motor on the stand.  I think that the VW-specific stands allow you to do
this.

I didn't find any adapters necessary for my engine stand.

I have a temporary page at http://mh005.infi_dot_net/~gkucsma/bustemp.html
which contains, in addition to other pics of my bus, images showing the
engine on my generic engine stand.
