Subject: Broken Crank.....

Last week I had the misfortune of dealing with a bunk crank from a rebuild on 
my 2000cc.  I 've checked the library and archives and I haven't found any 
information as to specifics I should check aside from wear and tear.  The 
crankshaft completely split  just behind the No. 1 piston push rod.  The 
engine was not run for more that 5 minutes after the event.  
    The engine has around 22k miles on it, and I am wondering what else 
possibly could have been ruined before mantling the engine.  Bearings? the 
Cam?

Thanks,
Dan in Reno
