&gt; Ordinary regular old &quot;Gear Oil&quot; is usually, but not always,

&gt; Gear Oil always stinks like sulphur, and sometimes,

unless it is synthetic, one of the strange things about synthetic gear oil
and tranny fluid is that it smells burned right out of the jugp

&gt; Automatic Transmission fluid will ruin a manual transmission.

and vice versa,  but GL-5 will not hurt the auto tranny FINAL DRIVE not in
the tranny itself,  remember the auto tranny has TWO different fills. the
auto box gets Dextron, the final drive gets 90wt gear oil 

&gt; You can get a really neat cheap pump for the 5 gallon bucket
&gt; of gear oil at the farm supply store.  The idiot book tells you
&gt; to use a big metal syringe to squirt in the gear oil, aieee

my gear oil comes in bottles with a spout that fits into the fill, and
just squeeze..
