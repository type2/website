go either route.

And a wise person you are!  The problem with the first method is that
it simply isn't true.  Except for &quot;classic&quot; vehicles (predating 1964,
I vaguely recall) you cannot import a non-DOT approved vehicle into
the US for street use.  You can bring it in for off-road use, however.

The second route will work, but it's risky.  What if the Customs
Service starts to wonder why that bus that came into the US never left
and starts prying around?  They could simply confiscate your bus and
charge you with god knows how many violations of their regs.

Yes, there are late-model VWs being driven around in the US, but I
think that the cost and hassle of importing them would far exceed the
cost and hassle of finding and restoring an existing VW.  The bonus is
that you will have an original, classic, German-built VW, rather than
a late-model Mexican or Brazilian bus with &quot;unique&quot; reengineering and
attendent parts availability problems.

I had a Brazilian exchange student and I jokingly told him that if he
sends me a bus (a cool one with the bay front end and splitty back
end) I would give him an &quot;A&quot; in the class.  So far no bus has shown up
on my doorstep, but if one does I'll have to eat my words above :)
