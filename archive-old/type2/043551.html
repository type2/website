Subject: Westfalia Tents

Greetings All!

I am interested in purchasing a tent for my '77 Westfalia.  However,  my
question is regarding the interchangeability of these tents.  What year
tents will fit what year buses?  Are the tents pretty year-specific?

I have found a tent for a '68, but don't know if it will work on my '77.

Any advice or leads would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Victor
