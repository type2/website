Subject: Re: Update on 78 FI with Pertronix not starting

&gt; Before you do anything else, give Petronix a call and ask a tech what the nominal voltage is to keep from damaging your ignitor.  
&gt; If you set up a seperate relay, be sure it's continuous duty, like the relay for a Westie aux battery.  IMHO, finding the problem with the stock harness is your best and cheapest bet.  

I don't really know about pertronix.. are you warning that supplying battery 
terminal voltage to the coil for a distributor with pertronix installed is 
NOT a good idea? B? 

I would think that the COIL mfg would have to be included in the mix.. it is 
the coil that draws the current that the pertronix has to withstand.
The higher the voltage supplied to the coil,, the higher the current the 
&quot;points&quot; have to switch.. 

Some coils do require a ballast resistor for just that reason.. to limit the 
current .. I was just assuming it wasn't a huge flame thrower coil that 
draws mega power,, and the pertronix could withstand the current. 

Let me know
