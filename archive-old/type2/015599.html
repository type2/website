&gt;Locktite won't help much.  You don't have to remove the engine to make the 
&gt;repair though.  

I agree with David that Locktite won't do it. Even JB Weld won't work most
the time, and is not advised. An alternative to helicoils is TimeSerts.
They sell a kit that includes the proper drill bit, tap and inserts with
installation tools. They are much stronger than helicoils and as near a
permanent fix as can be had. They won't loosen and turn back out like the
helicoils will. The kit is just this side of $100. 

The problem with in-situ (in place) repair is the skill required to drill
that sucker out straight. Even with high skill and experience that aluminum
is soft and the bit can drift. If the stud is not very near dead straight
you can have a hell of a problem getting the manifold on. If you do, when
you torque it down you get side load on the stud and it will crack sooner
than you might like. I just can't sell such a repair and feel good about
taking the money because the risk is it's all wasted with a short time
failure, time/money that could have been applied to fixing it right the
first time. I also advise, as others who have a reputation to protect, that
the only way to nix the risk of failure of this repair is to tear it down
and send it to the machinist who can drill that sucker true with the proper
maschine setup.

If those studs have rust pitting getting started, replace them all. I don't
care if quality studs do cost over $3 each. Nix the risk of broken studs
pronto. The cost to fix it right is onerouse.
The cost of compromise can be a new head in addition to the time/money
spent on pretend fixes.

(Note: Before I remove these fittings, I torque them to spec to insure they
will hold spec before I take them apart. I want to know about such issues
as pulled studs before I get it apart and spend lots of time/money then
find the failure upon reassembly. This is more especially true of
Wasserboxer head nuts/studs.)
