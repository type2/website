&gt; You might wanna go back in time to see the love and planning that went
into
&gt; my little 1776cc type 1 beauty.  She's the best one I ever
built...moderate,
&gt; quiet, powerful and extremely reliability.  I'd take that challenge,
&gt; especially if Rick keeps towing stuff ;-)  It'd be no contest on a 1/4
mile
&gt; though...stock fuel injection is great but no match for my 42DCNFs (sorry
&gt; Rick).

&gt; &gt; I agree completely that putting a type 1 in a late bus is pure folly.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I also agree that a *stock* type 1 is underpowered and won't last as
long
&gt; as
&gt; &gt; a stock type 4 engine.
&gt; &gt; Now my very un-stock 1776 type 1 in my 71 bus is *real* strong after
~80K
&gt; &gt; and I bet I make it to 200K no problem.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I'll race ya Rick ;-)
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; Steve, Rick:
&gt; Now is this race to 200k miles? (With no spare parts or overhauls?) That
&gt; would
&gt; be pretty interesting. My money would be on the type 4.
