Tom,

I believe the wear limit according to Bentley is .004&quot; on the teeth.

You can make the cover and pump body face flat by following the 
instructions in the hot rod book.

Buy a piece of replacement house window glass...cheapest easiest 
size...9X12?  !not plastic!  It needs to be *flat*.

Buy some wet/dry 300-400 grit black sandpaper.  Lay the sandpaper on the 
glass, flood it with parts cleaner(non explosive) and start sanding the 
cover plate using even circular motions with an even &quot;all over&quot; pressure.

It doesn't take long....piece of cake.

Cheers, dave

&gt; It has .010
&gt; clearance between the teeth and I couldn't measure any clearance between
&gt; the teeth and the body. Don't have a thin enough feeler gauge to fit.
&gt; The end plate shows very slight scoring but not enough to catch a
&gt; fingernail on. Trying to figure out how to remove the scoring but the
&gt; locator sleeve at one of the bolt holes prevents sanding it smooth like
&gt; on a type 1 pump. Am I trying too hard to save some bucks or should I
&gt; bite the bullet and buy a new pump?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks again to all of you,
