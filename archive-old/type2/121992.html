&gt; Although I am the Heir of Superman my Xray vision doesn't seem to

&gt; it be done?

Yes.

&gt; If so how to?

I haven't done this before, but I think the procedure is basically an 
extension of the procedure used to replace pushrod tube seals (left as 
an exercise for the reader :-).  With the tubes and pushrods out of the 
way, you can use a magnet-on-a-stick to grab the lifter and pull it 
out.  Then you can inspect it to your liking, bleed it if necessary, 
etc.  Make sure to always put the lifter back into the same hole whence 
it came (and in the same orientation, i.e. remember which is the cam 
lobe end).

&gt; Is it possible for Matthew to have a '79 2.0L FI and have Mech. 
&gt; Lifters?

Sure, it's possible that a PO could have put solid lifters in during a 
rebuild.  Let's hope that's not the case.  (I wonder how many people 
skip valve adjustments on such engines, assuming that they have 
hydraulics?)  It always bums me out when people replace a superior 
system with an older, inferior one (e.g. hydraulics -&gt; solids, FI -&gt; 
carbs, etc.)

Of course, it is also possible to have hydraulic lifters on older 
engines, if a PO was smart enough to have hydraulics installed when the 
engine was rebuilt.

Knowing which type you have is important, because it affects how the 
valves are adjusted.  Almost makes me want to hunt down one of the 
engine compartment stickers that the 78 and 79 models had that provided 
notice of the hydraulic lifters so I can slap it on the hatch or fan 
shroud of my 76 (w/ hydraulics).  More info == better! :-)
