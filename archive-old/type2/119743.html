Subject: BAY-AREA, '77 CAMPER FOR SALE!

Super clean '77 camper for sale. 2 liter engine, blue/white, pop top, interior &amp; exterior very clean, all tanks, cabinets, etc. very clean. New tires, new clutch, new transmission, new wheel bearings, wheel alignment. Alpine sound system, lots of equipment. 
Receipts and records available (over $6000.00 in the last two years). Needs top-end job.
This car runs very reliable and strong. 
 
I will be moving back to Germany in the beginning of 2004. I get a lot of compliments for this car. It has been a pleasure to own it and to restore it. I drive this car every day. The only thing it needs is a top-end job. Once that is taken care of, it will run for ever. Everything else is pretty much new.
 
If you are interested you can e-mail me or call me at 510-597-0346 and ask talk to Andreas. I am located in Emeryville which is right next to Berkeley. I have lots of pictures but unfortunately not digital ones. So, if you need some I can send them to you.
 
Andreas Schwerte
