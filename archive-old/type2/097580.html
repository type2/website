Subject: Re: [T2] Curse of the Voodoo Vacuum Leaks

[...]

&gt; The shop was not going by sound, but by using a propane test.  When they
&gt; sprayed at the plenum itself, they could measure a noticeable change in
&gt; the engine.  The fishy part (and this is what has them stumped): the shop
&gt; says after they spray near the plenum, the see the engine react ~10-15
&gt; sec later.  I tell them: maybe the propane drifts to another location
&gt; during that time and gets sucked into the air system at another point.
&gt; The shop says: that's what you'd think, but we sprayed everywhere else
&gt; and see no change in the engine; the only other suspect area is near
&gt; throttle body bushings, but this was minor.
&gt; What is your timing set at, at idle?
&gt; Here's my experience: the timing can't be set properly since the vac is
&gt; out of whack.  The bus _barely_ idles to begin with, only after it has
&gt; been warmed up a bit.  The bus will run with the timing around 7BTDC but
&gt; as I turn the dizzy to go for 5ATDC, the engine stalls.

When you have the timing at 7 before at idle, pull off the vacuum hose that is
on the inboard nipple of the vacuum advance [the flat side pointing left].

Does the idle speed up?
Do you have vacuum at that hose?

My guess is 'no' to both questions.
Follow that hose forward. It goes to a nipple pointing to the rear on the
throttle housing. That nipple is ONLY there for vacuum retard on the dizzy. If
it is open or the hose is split, you will think the plenum is leaking.
