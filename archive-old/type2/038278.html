Hey there Matt,

Yep, sometimes they are a &quot;freakin lame ass parts store&quot; but most
people call them a friendly local auto parts store. If the FLAPS
don't have it you have to go to the VW FLAPS.

Bus Terminology, Slang, Mailing List Acronyms and Jargon  is in the
library under Jargon. Here's the direct link:

Hope this helps,
