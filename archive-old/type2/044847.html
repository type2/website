Subject: [T2] Rear Tire camber

My 1970 bus, on the left rear tire, has positive camber.
I think I understand how to correct / adjust this,
even though I have never had occasion to do the job,
but..............
Who, specifically, out there has done this before?

Was it a pain in the you know what ?
What was your experience when you tackled this job?
Or have you managed to block the efforts put forth from your memory?
