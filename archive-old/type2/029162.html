&gt;&gt;A lot of new cars use the ABS system in a similar way to prevent
&gt;&gt;slippage, so it should work.

&gt;Wouldn't that be a limited slip differential?  Would that be a standard
&gt;feature on a bus?

The latest watercooled VWs have an option called EDL or Electronic
Differential Lock which uses the ABS system to sense wheelspin (it
activates when 1 wheel turns &gt;100RPM more then another wheel) and clamps
the brake on the spinning wheel. It is essentially the same as this turning
brake set up. It functions up to 20MPH and then the ASR system kicks in
which does the same but also reduces engine power.

Limited slip differentials were indeed offered as an option on busses in
some countries. That uses a differential with a clutch pack on each side of
the R&amp;P that allowed slippage when you went around a corner. When you
accelerated the clutch pack tightened up to lock the axle. I'm sure you
can't get the clutch pack parts anymore if you had one.
