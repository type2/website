Subject: Going Camping for the first time questions

Hello List,

Well, I have owned a vw bus for 6 years now and next
week will be the first time I have taken it camping. I
am going from Wilmington, NC to Linville Falls near
Boone (NC Mountains). My bus has a rebuilt engine and
a complete brake overhaul. I am having the clutch
replaced, an oil change, and adjustment done. Can
anyone give me any suggestions about what I need to be
careful of when driving or any tips at all about what
I need to bring. My bus has an electric fridge and a
fold out bed in the back. I am nervous because this is
the first long trip that I will take in it. I am a AAA
member, the premium plan. What should I take? I am
planning on going hiking a lot and just exploring the
mountains in general. I will probably carry a little
electric heater in case it gets cold and a small fan
if it gets too hot. Any advise would be appreciated. I
am excited and nervous at the same time. I will be
there from oct 18-23.

Thanks!
