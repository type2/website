Subject: Pressing out balljoints at home

 Has anyone got the plans or know what the holder for pressing in/out
balljoints looks like? I have a press at home and it just irks me to have to
take them to a local shop that will gouge the heck out of me for pressing in
new balljoints. I am the kind of guy that just HAS to try stuff. :-) even if
I screw it up the first time. LIfe is short, you have to try everything it
has for us, including learning, learning, learning!
Courtney
