Oil pressure will work if you have the proper sender.  
Engine temp might work, but it was made for water so it will show hot
when measuring oil temperature.
Fuel gauge isn't likely, as the senders probably aren't compatible.
Speedo will be the wrong ratio, but you can get in-line gears to make
it work.
Tachometer probably won't work.
Lights is lights.  They'll work if you hook 'em up right.

I think that you'd be a lot happier (and a lot less frustrated) with
aftermarket VDO gauges.  Adapting Toyota parts into VWs doesn't sound
like my idea of a good time.  It is a heck of a challenge, though, and
if you do it you'll have the only one!
