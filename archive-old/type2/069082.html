Subject: Re: Compression Test 74 Bus

I use the compression tester from Sears with the black hose attached- on
1600 engines and on the 2000cc FI engine- it takes a &quot;feel&quot;, a knowledge of
the angle the plug sits in the head, and a trick of holding the hose at the
right angle with one hand while you twist the gauge end to feed the tester
into the plug hole.  You can tell when it's screwing in whern you're no
longer fishing fort the right angle as you keep turning the gauge.  #2 in
the bus (FI) is the fun one with longest reach, and I do it while lying
across the rear bed and peering into the hatch that's removable.   The idea
ogf an intermediate adaptor with plug threads at one end and a screwin hole
at the other is  OK.
