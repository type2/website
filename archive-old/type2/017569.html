Actually I have seen a Bus down in southern Mexico that was set-up as a Movie
Bus...  this old feller rode around to different villages stopping for a day or
two showing 2 movies each night (this was early '70's).  High roof Bus with a
Pull down silver screen on the driver's side and a little table for the 16mm
projector.  Inside he also had a little gas generator to run the projector in
really remote/isolated areas...  I used to spend summers with my Grandfather down
in Southern Mexico and Central America.  Apparently there were several of these
traveling movie Busses at the time...

If it is one of these, it would be a shame to gut it....

&gt; Went to see a bus today. Mid 60's split. Been inside over 30 years. No rust.
&gt; 10,000 on the odm.  Original paint very shiney! Belongs to a old eccentric
&gt; who said he bought it to play his old movies?? The guy bought it in germany
&gt; and thinks VW made a &quot;movie&quot; model. Give me a break.
&gt;
&gt; He has had in the family room of his very large (mansion) house all these
&gt; years and wifey making him get rid of it. He says he starts it every once in
&gt; a while to see if it runs and does fine. Who knows? The guy is pretty old.
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, I bought it for cheap and gonna make a camper out of it. Anybody want
&gt; the insides? He says it all works. I will like the extra headroom.
