Subject: Ball Joints on 1973 Bus
Message-ID: &lt;378D7E58.6548_at_shore_dot_net&gt;

I recently brought my 1973 Bus in for a checkup, and the mechanics at
the VW garage told me I needed to replace all 4 ball joints in the
front.  

Is this an impossible job, or can I do this myself?   I was told by the
mechanics that this is a difficult job, to only be done by
professionals, and that perhaps a blow torch might be needed to extract
them.

Any ideas on this?    Thanks!
