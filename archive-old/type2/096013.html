I have a theory as to what your problem is...

This happened to me on the way to Palenque in Chiapas.  I had so much
trouble getting up-hill that eventually we got stuck on a big mountain,
where we luckily got saved by some nice Washington State kids in the middle
of the night.  In my case some rings were blown and I was getting oil onto
my spark plugs.  The oil built up fairly quickly and when it did the
pinging would start, at first uphill then all the time.

Since I was low on funds and far from home, what I did was put the extendor
adaptors on the spark plugs to stop new oil from getting to them.  This at
least kept me going long enough to get back up to Canada.  I suggest if
this is the case you can try a similar short-term solution until you're
ready to strip down the motor and change the rings.

Also, I heard a good old school indian mechanics trick is to put a drop of
transmission-fluid in your oil.  It is thicker and gets stuck on the rings
for a bit... (but I know a lot of people would object to this, but when
you're stuck in the middle of the jungle you do what you need to do!!), try
this with a frequent washing of your plug w/ extendors and you can keep
running for a few more miles.  Gasoline is good for washing plugs clean if
nothing else is available.

Good luck!
