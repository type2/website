Subject: top shelf cabinet instalation

hi folks, 

I am looking to install a top shelf cabinet in the 71
westy.  I guess I need a bolt to fit through the hole
on the passenger side.  My question.  Does the back of
the cabinet screw into the same holes as the snaps for
the rear screen?  I had to replace these, old ones
were rusted out.  It seems that they go there, just
want to be sure.  If so, Does anyone know where i can
get snaps w/ long (1inch) screws?

Thanks

Rich Racioppa
