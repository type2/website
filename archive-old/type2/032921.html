Subject: junk yards

hi,
i'm restoring a 1971 westy. the body and mechanicals are beautiful. i'm
working on the interior. does anyone know of good vw bus junk yards in
the los angeles area??  i need origianl seats for the back of my bus
(plus back cushion and wheel cover) . also could use another jump seat
(behind driver) and ice box unit. i'd also ove another original floor
that is in better shape than mine.

i'm sorry that tom has to sell his 1971 bus. it must be very sad. what
about selling the children first (ho ho just joking) when you figure out
price, i might be interested. i've put about $16,000 into the
restoration of my bus and i still am working away to make it look like
an original. is this a disease?

i figured that dawn was experiencing some personal challenges but she
has always kept in touch. sometimes life does get tough and it is great
when we have a community to back us upuntil the clouds pass by!
