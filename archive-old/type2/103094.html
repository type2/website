Subject: EveryBus 2003 T-Shirts Here!!!

Hi Everybody! I'm sure you all have your calendars marked for the     
rapidly approaching EveryBus festival. (www.everybus_dot_com)             
Those of you who have attended in the past know that the t-shirts have
sold out within a couple hours. Don't be denied your shirt this year- 
pre-order now, and save the hassle of worrying about it once you get  
there.                                                                
This year's design, hand-selected by Chris himself, was done by Greg  
Potts, and can be viewed at this link:                                
 http://www.pottsfamily_dot_ca/EB2003/EB03logo3.pdf                       
The font will be slightly different, but other than that, the design  
will be pretty much as it appears. I'll post the final artwork on my  
site once I get it, but wanted to go ahead and start taking orders    
now, as there isn't much time with this year's EveryBus being a couple
weeks earlier than in the past. I am placing the final order in 2     
weeks, so I need your order in my hand before then.                   
Ordering information is on the t-shirt page of                        
http://www.TeamSpatula_dot_com                                            
If you have any questions, please e-mail me.                          
thanks!
