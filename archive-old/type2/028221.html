Hi Folks,

My 1979 Westy &quot;Sweet Pea&quot; has been running well, and I've been enjoying late 
spring/early summer driving here in the Colorado mountains.  I think I have 
it pretty well dialed in for warm weather, with 20W50 oil, correct cooling 
flaps settings, and new plugs/points/cap/rotor.

On my way back down from Independence Pass (12,000ft Continental Divide) on 
Friday, I noticed something disturbing.  Whenever I went around a curve at a 
&quot;spirited&quot; speed (left or right), oil pressure would drop from the usual 
40psi to as low as 5psi.  The oil light would go on (at pressure lower than 
8psi), then turn off as the road straightened and oil pressure climbed back 
up.

My engine is a 1979 T4 GE-series FI, with (assumed) almost 100k miles on it. 
  It leaks oil from the pushrod tube seals and valve covers, and probably 
blows oil past the rings as well.  I'm guessing the problem is that hot oil 
is sloshing to one side of the sump, leaving the pump pickup area with too 
little oil, and consequently too little pressure.

Are there any solutions?  Do I need a special deep sump?  Should I just make 
sure the oil is completely topped up before every drive?  Should I avoid 
driving the curvy roads?  Should I rebuild my engine before it throws a rod 
and leaves me stranded?

Thanks for any help.
