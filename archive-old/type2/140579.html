Who in God's name allowed the krauts to use flat bladed screw's for that
sheet metal?
Whoever it was should be lined up against a wall and shot--dead, morto,

I had to use the impact driver on every one of them ( seemed like a
hunded of them.)

Then someone before you took that engine out, apart, and put it back together using type 1 engine screws. I
see it all the time.

You can just about know a type 4 engine has not been screwed with when you see it still has all its original
cheesehead screws.  When I see all straight slot screws, I cringe knowing it is a basketcase inside. Ususally
the case says GEX under the tin......
