Chris,

Uninformed is unprepared.  Why have a speedometer when you can use your
senses to tell you how fast you're going?  Or a gas gauge since surely your
fine-tuned senses will tell you how far you've gone on the present tank of
fuel?  You can consult Bob Hoover on this one.

cheers,

Ben

&gt; &gt; Golly, the absolute paranoia of new(older) VW owners! We went for years
&gt; &gt; without all these guages, just depending on our 5 regular senses, and
thatn
