Subject: new job, 50 MILE commute to work, NEED/gages

ALL auto gages are inaccurate at best.  what you need
is to figure out where your vw operates and mark those
locations in your head then when they differ from what
the base reading is then you will want to figure out
why.  if your temp has gone up by say 10F and all
other things being equal you will know you have some
anomaly and your job will be to figure out what it is
although the engine could still be well within safe
specs as far as temperature go.  to get a truely
accurate temp measurement you would have to spend 400$
or more and pressure would be even more.  in all truth
though, before all this b.s. with VWoA came up i went
and bought a jetta tdi which gets 50mpg as i have
about a 65 mile commute one way when i'm driving the
carpool which leaves my aircooleds safe from idiots
who cut you off, slam on the brakes and wonder why
they are rearended and from me killing them and my
vintage vw's.
