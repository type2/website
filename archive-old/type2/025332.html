&gt; There was a scorching column in last month's Hot VW mag slamming anyone who
&gt; wanted to modify their bus in any way, and I've had my ear bent at several
&gt; VW events about keeping the bus &quot;pure&quot;. Aside from cutting out the rear
&gt; wheel metal (yuk) I plan to personalize it any way I desire. It was a rusty,
&gt; bondo covered piece of crud when I found it, so no one can say I've &quot;ruined&quot;
&gt; it.

I'm faced with the same problem. If I was going to do a bone-stock
restoration, I'd be left with a white bus with tan vinyl interior. My wife
wears shorts in the summer and has informed me that under no circumstances
am I to put vinyl seat covers on this bus.

And white is a boring damn color; reminds me of a big ol' German
refrigerator. Refrigerators belong in kitchens.

I thought I was going to paint the thing jade green...now I'm trying to
decide between jade green, emerald green, turquoise or sapphire blue. One of
those gemstone colors. Ruby, which is my birthstone, is out of the question,
since North Carolina state law requires all Sikkens dealers to call the
police and ask if any banks have been robbed within the last half hour or so
before they can sell you a gallon of red Autocryl.

BTW, what's the German word for &quot;gemstone&quot;?
