Subject: Re: [T2] RE: Bus speakers...

&gt;Ordinarily I wouldn't recommend much that Radio Shack has to offer...
&gt;But... Their Linaeum speakers are on sale for 50 bucks apiece. 8 ohm,
&gt;though, but if you've got the juice to run 'em in your Bus, they are a
&gt;really sweet sounding speaker...Equal to or better than many at hun-
&gt;dreds more... ;-)

Yeah - noticed they had a 4&quot; speaker that I need for my motorcycle 
(replacement) for $10 each when NAPA had the same size for $20. WOW - Radio 
Shack beat somebody out on price - that is a FIRST for me!

Lot's of great prices on speakers too. Some less than $5 even and still 
pretty good. I've done business with them with excellent results. Just wish 
they had the 4&quot; speaker I need right now...
