From: Rick Taylor &lt;BusBarn_at_prodigy_dot_net&gt;:
&gt;&gt;If someone would make a temp sender that would slide down the tube where 
&gt;&gt;you check the oil (as the berg unit does) and read out to a gauge, that 
&gt;&gt;would be a good indicator, but as far as I know, no one has. &lt;&lt;

I just bought one like this from Bus Boys in Redding, CA.  The sender and 
gauge are accurate in boiling water too.  It reads about 10 degress hotter 
than my relief valve sender on the same gauge althought I have not pulled 
that sender to test it in boiling water yet.

Give Bus Boys a call or visit them on the web.  This may be a new product.  
I love it.
