Subject: Case welding update

I got my '77 2.0 case back yesterday from the machine shop.  They were happy
with my weld repair (broken lug by case breather box) and bearing bores
checked out.  The welder very cautiously TIG welded it with some sort of
4000 series rod but it wasn't an easy job for him.  The machine shop said
that my crank was still good as well...standard /standard (had them fit new
bearings) and rods/bushings checked OK so I'm in business!  I have ordered a
hydraulic cam and purchased a new Maule P&amp;C set yesterday along with the
rest of my parts.  Have all new HP fuel line and am making the Hoover
bulkhead fittings.  The overhauled gearbox is patiently awaiting
installation and engine parts are piling up.  Tin is cleaned and painted.
This this month long &quot;clutch change&quot; is progressing...I guess I should get
around to picking a clutch kit as well.  I've owned my bus for over six
months now.._dot_can't wait to get back on the road :0)
