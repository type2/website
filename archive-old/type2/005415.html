Subject: needed: crossover pipe for '81 Vanagon
Date: Fri, 11 May 2001 13:44:39 -0500
	charset=&quot;Windows-1252&quot;

Does anyone have a crossover pipe for a stock exhaust on a '81 Vanagon for
sale?

First vendor complaint:  I ordered a 'complete exhaust system including
crossover pipe' from our friends (and I do like them) www.busdepot_dot_com and
they call me and say they don't have any crossover pipes.  I guess I could
have canceled the order then, but I didn't.  I don't think I would have been
as willing to put together a stock exhaust system if I'd known this earlier,
I'd already received the catalytic converter for the system from them a
month prior to this call.  And I've been waiting over a month now for my new
steering rack, which he told me when they just called, that they're still
trying to get a hold of their vendor..   Hope it gets all gets here before
my honeymoon road trip!

Thanks!
