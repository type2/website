Do something real quick for me, will you? Take the oil pump cover off and
turn the engine over with a wrench. (Yes, getting to the oil pump on a Type
4 is a pain. Do it anyway.)


Jim, You can not do this on a type 4 oil pump like you can on a type 1,2,3.
You must remove the oil pump completely to pull the back off the oil pump to
expose the gears. The pump is funtionaly the same as a type 1, but designed
totaly different.
