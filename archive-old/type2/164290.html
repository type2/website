&gt;&gt; Don: I'm coming in late on this one.  What test led you to suspect the

&gt; Actually, Blazer's Automotive in Denver found it. I was on a time

&gt; while with no luck. They also have a sniffer so they could make sure I
&gt; passed.

I'm surprised at that last statement.  Here in California you basically have 
to set timing and RPM's to factory specs.  If the engine is mechanically 
sound (no vacuum leaks, exhaust leaks, sufficient compression, etc.) the 
only other variable left to fiddle with is the fuel/air ratio, and a ratio 
that's reasonably in-line with the factory specs *should* get you to pass, 
and the engine *should* run reasonably well.  Not to say some further 
adjustment in things might not have the engine running &quot;better&quot;, but it 
shouldn't run like crap to pass smog.  What's going on here?
