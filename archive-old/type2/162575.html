the big question is what would have been changed/damaged by the backfire.
before backfire (which I caused not engine problem) it ran ok.

&gt; &gt;&gt;  Is your cold-start injector leaking by chance?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; why would a backfire damage that??  but I did check it and it appears to
&gt; &gt; be fine.. it starts fine, and after the engine gets up to maybe 185
&gt;
&gt; I'm thinking more along weird running engine - excess gas in manifold...
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; manifold  vacuum good?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; next on my list.  it's hard to check when you can't keep it running
&gt; &gt; without holding the throttel part way open...
&gt;
&gt; Yeah.. that'd be tricky..
&gt;
&gt; Ok, the obvious:
&gt;
&gt; -timing ok? (as far as you can tell)

yup pretty close to right on

&gt; -getting spark to all cylinders?

when I checked, yes

&gt; -are all cylinders firing

again when I checked yes

&gt; -spark plugs good

only a month or two old....

&gt; -temp sensor I and II good

haven't checked yet, why would a backfire change them??

&gt; -checked all the resistance values for your AFM

again not yet, but why would a bacfire change resistance values

&gt; -the connections to all the plugs for EFI clean (progold is good for that)

pulled em and put them back one a couple times seemed ok, prob should
spray them with the CRC I have for that

&gt; -cables attached correctly

why would they change with a backfire,, but they all appear to be right

&gt; -points make any difference?

????

&gt; -fuel pressure good?

have remote fuel pressure gauge, (was checking for another reason) but it
was dead on the Bentley specs.

&gt; do you have an assistant/remote starter handy to at least keep it
&gt; running while you pull injector cables to see any change in rpm.

I do haave a rear start switch , just one hand for accel and another hand
for starter   uh running out of hands...

I can understand why some would cause this problem, but the only thing
that happened was the backfire and now won't run when it did before..???


Bob???
pass another cold one..
