wheh, tough one, but I know the NY emission test is a tough one, and the
FI 2liter engine can pass if it is running right, BUT getting a 1600DP to
pass may be more than the engine is capable of doing.  Especially since
you are in effect trying to get a 1971 engine to pass the 1976 test which
is much tougher....considering that 1600 engine lasted longer in buses
outside of the USA I would think even VW was having trouble getting a
carbed engine to pass.

but, who knows??

YMMV and probably will
