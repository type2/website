we are sorry to say that the warehouse will be shut down for a period of 15
days (approx.)
we will still be able to ship small items out of the showroom, but no sheet
metal, doors or
large parts due to lack of space, all this is being done to help improve our
service to the list and the VW community, even though it was forced on me by
the fire here on November 26,1999 (the remodel).


Thanks to all that came by and visited after BBB IV and we will have an even
larger inventory of bus parts then we already have.(new and used)

We still will be taking orders and shipping, and will always be here for
technical and parts availability advice and will have the new online catalog
up soon

Thank-you     the staff of old volks home of az.
