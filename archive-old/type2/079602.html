Subject: flywheel and Campers On Cape Cod

Hi Volks,
   Last week I was asking for advice on how to get rid of the scoring on my 
flywheel made by the forward crankshaft seal.   Several of you said to just 
polish it out with emery cloth, and that's what I did.
   I started off with 320 grit and worked round and round the diameter of 
that part of the flywheel until the marks were gone.  Then I switched to 400 
and then 600 grit paper to polish the surface until it was nice and smooth 
and shiney.  I put the engine back in this past Monday and am leak free 
about 80 miles later.  Thanks for the good advice!
   On another note, I had a great time at Campers on Cape Cod and at the 
Transporterfest even though my bus was at home.  I even got to meet a couple 
of list members, Rich and Jeff, for the first time and visit with friends 
from previous bus events.  It was a good weekend despite the gray overcast 
sky and cool winds.  And thanks to Andrea Rasso for the game of LiMBO Lingo. 
  It's kinda like bingo in that you get a card with little boxes on it.  
Each box has a word or phrase that is bus related.  Then Andrea would call 
out different words and phrases and if they were on your card you mark them 
off.  Get a full line marked off and you win.  It was a nice way for the 
group to spend some time together after the potluck dinner on Saturday.
   Well I'm starting to ramble, so that's it for now.
