Subject: Ignition problem FIXED ('69 westy)!!!!
Message-ID: &lt;19990416234427.24754.rocketmail_at_send101.yahoomail_dot_com&gt;

Happy Friday (MOST happy, as my bus is on the road again!)


Well, got my ignition switch fixed! I only got one response to my
questions on this and it wasn't all that helpful. 

My problem was that I had innadvertantly not fully inserted my key
when starting the bus. The key turned to the &quot;on&quot; position and froze
(no, it shouldn't have turned at all, but it did). I could get the key
out, but the switch was frozen in the on position.


I was afraid I was going to have to replace the ignition switch with
an aftermarket one, or try to find one used with an original key like
mine (not very likely!). Needless to say, I was motivated to try
saving this one!

After many frustrated attempts at removing the switch without pulling
off the steering wheel, I stumbled on the answer.... on top of the
switch-cylinder housing (very close to where you put the key in), is a
small hole that resembles a tunnel running at a 90 degree angle with
the switch-cylinder. Apparently, there is a spring inside, that, when
pushed with a small nail (or a straightened paper clip), allows the
cylinder lock to dissengage so you can remove the switch. Well,,,, I
still couldn't get the switch out, but on a whim, tried turning the
key....TA-DA!!!!

While I was in there, I also took a look at the electrical portion of
the switch which has also been fussy lately (and at $52.00 for the new
part, I was willing to deal with a little fussines!). Turned out it
was a bit loose; ten minutes (and a $0.24 wiring tie) later, it too
was fixed. 

Starts right up with no more having to find the &quot;sweet-spot&quot; in the
ignition switch and best of all, it cost me $2.39 (for a package of 10
wiring ties) for the total repair and about 1 hour of work! 

Compare that to $52.00 for the electrical switch, $50.00 for a used
original mechanical ign-switch, $25.00 for a 5lb. sledge hammer (to
remove the steering wheel) and at LEAST 3 hours of labor!. That's
$125.00 in the bank and 2 more carefree hours of my time. Not bad.
