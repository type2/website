The '79 Westy has a water pump mounted on the bottom of the water tank,
externally.  If you don't have one, Bus Depot carries them.  Mine was broken
off at the neck when we first got our Westy.  They are easy to replace.

The fridge, at least in the '79, runs on ammonia.  Yours is probably a
Dometic.  Do an internet search on &quot;dometic&quot; and you will eventually get to
their site.  They will gladly provide you with a manual for your fridge.
Ours is an oddball, top loading one (RC 152) that apparently was only used
in the '79.  They still had the manual.

In the archives is, or was, a &quot;Westfalia Refrigerator Troubleshooting&quot; guide
www.type2_dot_com/bartnik/fridgediag.htm which can help.

&gt; I did it! I took the plunge and am now the owner of a 77 Westfalia
&gt; Campmobile. I have started the renovation first by simply cleaning her up.
&gt; I am in need of some parts but primarily I am interested in a good service
&gt; manual. Does anyone have a lead? Also, my next step is to change the oil
&gt; and filters etc... Is there an oil treatemnet or addative that is
&gt; recomended for air cooled engines? I want to start with the simple things.
&gt; It seems like there are alot of disconnected wires hanging around. This
&gt; model camper has the stove, sink (with external pump), refridgerator (does
&gt; anyone know if this refridge is propane fueled -  how I may find out?). I
&gt; suppose these wires at one time were ment to opperate these features but
&gt; now hang uselessly waiting for someone to really love this poor neglected
&gt; van. I need some handles for the cabinet doors - the ones thaat have the
&gt; little button that you push to open...
&gt; Your help is super appreciated,
&gt; David Day
