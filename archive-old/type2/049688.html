&gt; p.s. i didnt mention if a standard shift bus has recently become your
&gt; daily driver, if thats the case, your problem is already solved, you'll be
&gt; driving standard shift like a long haul trucker before you know it :)

I got a lot of feed back about this, and I thank you all for that.  But I do
want to clear up this bit here.  I do know how to drive a stick.  This is the
second bus I've driven.  I can drive stick.  But the problem I have is that I
live in an area where there are no hills.  In fact, I know of only three in the
area.  One is in town, and I avoid it, the other two are about half an hour
away, so I just don't go there.  The bus is my daily driver in the summer.  Not
because I'm afraid it will rust, but because I'm afraid the snow drifts coming
in will freeze me solid.

    So, I've pretty much decided to take the manual on the trip.  It's easier
that way, anyway.  I've got a manual already.  I'll just have to drive an hour
to find a hill I could practice on.  And I still have to say, I'm very scared.
The idea of rolling backwards into someone's lexus suv and getting sued is very
frightening.  So that's my worst fear.  But I guess I can deal with it.

    And just in case, my dad works for the fire department.  I think I'm going
to hang one of those &quot;keep back 500 feet&quot; signs on my bumper.

Thanks.
