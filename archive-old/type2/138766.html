  Vehicle:  78 VW Riviera Conv, 2.0L, nearly all stock
  or correct parts except the Dizzy.

  Background info:  The T2 sensor 100% failed before
  Christmas, and I replaced it in Late December.  New
  Sensor caused new problem.  Grrr.  New part is
  BOS-0-280-130-012, which shows as correct for 78
  2-liter bus.  Old sensor paper label is marked &quot;012A.&quot;
   Is there a Temp 2 sensor REVISION I should be using
  instead?

  Problem:  Replacement T2 temp sensor is not working
  well.  Physically located near third cylinder.


  Could a list member hasten my solution and reduce my
  frustation?  Where?  How much?  Correct Diagnosis
  above?  Seems like this was discussed in Nov or Dec
  '04, but couldn't find from T2 archive.
