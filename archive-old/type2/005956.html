I didn't notice that a boot had broken until too late. The right
axle inner boot has died, and the CV joint is clunking.

I could replace the boot and CV joint for around $65, or I could
go to the ecology wrecking yard and pull an axle with two
CV joints (used, of course) for about $25.  

This is for the 71 bus. I know that the axles are the same 
from 68 up to some year. Are they the same through the
Vanagon years, or just up to 79?

And what is the best test for being any good? Obviously, 
I'd look for good boots.
