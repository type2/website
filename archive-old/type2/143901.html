Subject: Re: [T2] Ball joint boots only?

Haven't done it yet, but I also bought the boots.  It
has to be much simpler than pressing out the
balljoints, which everyone says is a major league
PITA.   I think I got them from bus-boys_dot_com.   From
what I hear, it's a good move.  Keep in touch on this.
 Thanks...KR

&gt; If I might resurrect this year-old thread, while I
&gt; was replacing brake hoses I
&gt; discovered that my left lower ball joint boot is
&gt; torn.
&gt; 
&gt; The ball joints themselves are still tight.
&gt; 
&gt; The full ball joint repair procedure sounds
&gt; horrific.  I don't have a clear
&gt; sense, though, of how little or how much I'd have to
&gt; tear apart just to
&gt; replace one boot.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone know?
&gt;
