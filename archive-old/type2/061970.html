Uh, lets see, a small drip system into the tail pipe might
work but I haven't thought much about it!

I also like the directional wind shield washer approach.

Dave &quot;da 74 bus man&quot;.

Thom the main man said:

&lt; We made it all the way across the
&lt;intersection before the smoke cleared, and looked back to see that she  
&lt;hadn't even _moved_ - sitting there with this stunned look on her face,  
&lt;soot all over her and her new car!

An image I'll never forget: I wish I could do that in the bus.
