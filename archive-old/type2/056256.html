Subject: Leaded petrol (British listee)

Hi Volks,
          I've been trawling the archives for information on octane vs. advance and not managed to find what I need. Can anyone advise?

 In the UK we will have leaded petrol available for the next eighteen months or so. I intend to continue using it until then, mostly because it seems to give the top-end an easier time of it. I understand that it shouldn't be necessary to prevent valve-seat-recession but is generally expected to prolong the life of the valves/heads regardless.

 My engine calls for minimum 91RON petrol but the leaded fuel here is 97RON (lower octane ratings were phased out some years ago).

 (1) Can I advance the ignition to take advantage of this higher octane rating? 
 (2) How much?
 (3) How can I tell if I've gone too far?
 (4) Will this be likely to offset any advantage to using the leaded fuel anyway?

 Thanks in advance.

Cheers,
        W.
PS If anyone's interested the alternative grades are &quot;regular&quot; unleaded at 95RON and &quot;Super&quot; unleaded at 98RON, it isn't yet clear what approach will be taken when lead is phased out. If you're not interested then why are you still reading? Go on- stop it!   Now!
