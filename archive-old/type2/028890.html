Chet,

First you have to ground the plug or else no sparks will fly. Hold the
threads to a ground then crank.  This should be a problem if your getting
spark off the wire. First loosen the Philips head hose clamp that mounts the
elbow from the air flow meter and just pull it to the side and crank it
over. If then it starts right up check out your air flow meter, refer to
Bentley. If not, start with the basics tune up stuff. Remember go Bosch or
go home. New points cap rotor condenser. A valve job is easy and a good
thing to know how to do, get new gaskets if you do this. Later good luck I
just spend a few days on a fellow listies 77 and we got almost every thing
except the head temp sensor was loose. Nothing beats a good mechanic well
except maybe $200 bucks still in your pocket. Have fun and oh a few beers
also helps keep your head in the game when wrenching on stuff for the first
time.

Subject: [T2] '77 FI problems....


Hello everybody:

I've got a '77 FI bus that's been runnin' great; until I tried to fire her
up the other morning.  It sits there and cranks but doesn't fire up and
start!  Last night my buddy and I performed some tests, and here's what we
came up with.  I pulled the center connection off of the distributer cap and
checked that for spark which would tell me if my coil was working, right?
Well, I got the spark so I think I'm OK there.  We then pulled a plug out
and cranked on the ignition in which case I should see the spark jump
between the gap in the plug....
correct?  There wasn't a spark there.  Could this be my condesor that needs
replacing?  Another note---I could smell gas when the engine was being
cranked.  Also, I did charge up the battery just in case it was a little low
and wouldn't be able to fire the injectors.  Any help from some of you
novice bus experts would be extremely appreciated!!!

Thanks,
Chet
