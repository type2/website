[...]  I.e., the steering feels less mushy that it previously did.  
Still wants to plow in turns at anything above low speed.

&gt; Wow!  You actually push your bus hard enough that you can tell that the
&gt; front wheels break loose before the rears?  I always thouight that VWs
&gt; oversteered (rear end breaks first) due to the rearward CG.  I've never
&gt; been brave enought to test this practically, though.
