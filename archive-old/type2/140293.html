Subject: [T2] Newbie hitting walls...

OK, heres the deal... Im STILL trying to get my bus running good again..
I am hitting brick walls here... I need help...

Problem:

Low power in the lower portion of all the gears... I had a post going about 
this a while ago... here:

http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/forum/viewtopic.php?t=152848&amp;highlight=

Same problem.. The high portion regains almost what would be full power, 
then you shift and back to no power, then you get through 2nd and you get 
better, then again no power in 3rd, and so on... It gets worse with the 
higher gears....

Im reading 11.5 on my vacuum gauge and it is fairly steady, about 1 
graduation of shakiness...

Ive put a smoke machine on it and found no leaks, some vvery minor things 
but nothing to cause my problem... This leads me to think that I actually do 
not have a vacuum LEAK, but not creating a vacuum very well...

My fuel pressure is a couple of pounds too high due to the low vacuum. At 
the highest, its 37-38 psi.. I have put on a new filter.. Im probably gonna 
get some good clean injectors and replace them, but I dont see why that 
would affect the vacuum...

My compression is:
120--130
130--130
I have new rings on #3, so they probably have not seated yet..

Im running a 009 and it is timed at 8 at idle, and 30 at full advance..
New plugs, wires, cap rotor, ect... Swapped coils, same thing. Manually 
reset plug gapping. Yes, I know I want an SVDA, but she used to run good 
with a 009 and I dont want to introduce variables... I WILL switch.

New points set on a dwell to 49...

Set my valves to 1 and 1/2 turns in after BARELY touching....

Did the resistance checks on the ECU plug and everything checked out within 
spec...

It ran good for months, so its not valve timing..
Excessive exhaust back pressure??

Like I said, I put the smoke machine on there thinking that it would point 
out my folly and I would fix it, but now I feeling that I do not have a 
vacuum leak, but then where has my vacuum gone????? Im at 11.5..
Please help lead me in the right direction.. What did I miss??

Thank you in advance...
Aaron
