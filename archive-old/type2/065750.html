Subject: Mr. Vanagon is not happy!

Please read this *short* tale and help a fellow loafer.

After an aborted exhaust r/r my one and only means of transportation is
flaking out. First, let me get you up to speed with my tale of whoa. I find
(for reasons I can't explain) that I can replace the exhaust on my '81
Vanagon easier when the engine is separated from the rest of the vehicle. So
last Saturday using a new found toy (transmission jack) I proceeded to
remove said engine from said Vanagon. But being a bit slow in the fine motor
skills department it took way longer than expected. The toy I was using
(renting) had to get back to the shop, so with the old exhaust still in
place, I put everything back together and used a neighbors car to get the
toy back before the shop closed. 

After everything was in place I tried to start the Vanagon, but it would
only start, run and then stop. After rechecking everything that I had
touched, I found a *very* loose ground (one of the grounds that are spaded
to the top of the block, under the FI pumpkin.) After putting a new spade
connection on the broken ground wire, I tried the engine again, but this
time it started and kept on running. Problem solved! Wrong! Needing to get
the kids their powdered milk dinner, I *attempted* a run to the store. I
only got 3.5 blocks and the engine died and went back to the trick of
starting, but not running. After an hour of swearing, kicking, smoking,
fiddling, wrenching, and such, the engine started and I drove it back home. 

Today the van/bus started and stayed running, but I was afraid to take it
anywhere. I let it run for 20-25 min. and no problems. What in the heck is
wrong with this thing and is it safe/reliable to drive anywhere? Please send
me any suggestion you might have.

thanks for reading this far!
