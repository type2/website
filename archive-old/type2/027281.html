Hey y'all
With the cold weather here in the Carolinas I have had the opportunity to 
experience 3 (that's right, 3) blown oil filters.  The real fix is to put a 
pressure relieving oil pump cover but right now I don't have the time to do 
an engine pull and re-reengineer the rear mount.

I'm considering going to a synthetic oil rated maybe 5-30 or so.  What does 
the wisdom of the list have to say about using synthetics and which has 
shown to be best?

Mad Uncle Dave
