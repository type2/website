Subject: Re: [T2] compu-fire installation tips?

&gt; New platinum plugs, new wires, new rotor and new cap
&gt; will go in with the compu-fire. I've got a stock coil.
&gt; Does the compufire need a special (blue?) coil?

The same company sells their own coil, but I think that any good coil would
probably be just fine.
Just don't get those two leads reversed.
My pal, &quot;Al&quot;, at J-Bugs, recommended putting the Compufire into a Bosch .050
Distributor, and setting it around TDC or slightly before. I'm glad I took
his advice on it.. Really like the results.
