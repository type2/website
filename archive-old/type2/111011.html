&gt; Your facts are a little twisted here this morning--
&gt;
&gt; Methane is NOT natural gas--

Natural gas consists of 87-96% methane.  Not pure, but close enough that
the flammability of pure methane and natural gas are the same, and that
is the property that we are considering.  As I said, the liklihood that
this product having methane as a major constituant is very low, since the
boiling point of methane is much too low for an F-12 system

&gt; You ought to take the time to examine the product info site---just for
&gt; fun to see what this stuff is all about--

It's yet another &quot;drop in replacement&quot;.  If it has methane in it it won't
get approved by the powers that be for mobile uses.  The only approved
&quot;drop in replacement&quot; for mobile users of F-12 that I am aware of is
GHG-12 (or whatever they are calling it these days)

&gt; Great scare tatics you layed on the list--

I didn't lay any scare tactics on this list.  I pointed out the
incongruity of the assertion that propane/butane mixes were bad and that
methane was better.  They're all flammable, but the quantity of
refrigerant is very small so the danger is minor.  As I said, I'd worry
more about the 100 pounds of gasoline in the tank than I would about the
pound of flammable hydrocarbon in the AC system

Heck, the stuff will probably work great, but don't forget basic chemistry
and physics when considering the manufacturer's claims.
