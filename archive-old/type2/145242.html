&gt; Hello everyone,
&gt; I have a chance to buy some pretty nice &quot;recarro&quot; seats that are currently
&gt; on a '64 bug seat frame (with rails). Will the seats fit into my '71? Or
&gt; will i have to modify them?

Bug seat rails will not fit in your bus.  You may be able to use the seats
if you mount them on rails to fit the bus.
