&gt;
&gt;Hi all,
&gt;
 Finally it popped loose, and the
&gt;whole plate shifted suddenly.  This caused the wire that goes from the 
vacuum
&gt;plate to the inside wall of the distirbutor ( I guess to the condensor) 
to
&gt;break in the middle and come competely off the plate.  So, I pulled the 
whole
&gt;thing out of the engine and put it on the work bench and spent the 
remainder
&gt;of my weekend trying unsuccessfully to solder a new wire into there.  I
&gt;couldn't get it at all.  My question is can this be repaired?  If I 
take it
&gt;into a shop can they stick a new wire in there?  Is it worth it?  Or 
should I
&gt;just buy a new distributor?  I've read through the archives and found a 
lot
&gt;about distributors but not this particular problem.  If I should get a 
new
&gt;one, which one?  I know there's been a whole lot said on here about 
this (i.e.
&gt;.009s vs. .005 and brands etc.) but I'd appreciate some advice, you can 
just
&gt;p-mail me. 
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;
As far as I know all you have to do is replace the condencer. It should 
come with new wire attached to it. The dissy has no wires in it. The 
wires are part of the condencer and are replaced with it. If I am wrong 
please correct me, But I have never seen one that was any other way.
