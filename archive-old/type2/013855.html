Subject: Cox Motor Company (great bone yard)

Hello list,

I was off from work today and decided to check out a
potential vw junkyard that I found in Jacksonville,
North Carolina. I was told by a list member that it
was a good place that had verry friendly and helpful
people. I found that this was the case. The Place is
called COX MOTOR COMPANY. This place does engine work
and has a verry large salvage yard in the back. They
also have many aircooled vw's for sale in varying
condition.

I went there to look at a stock carb settup that the
guy on the phone ( I am terrible at names) said they
had for a 73. The bone yard probably had 3 dozen
busses and westies. There were too many to count. They
also had bugs, Vanagons,Karma Ghia, and many others.

The carb settup, stock air cleaner, and everything was
there that I needed. There prices are not bad either.

so if you happen to drive through Jacksonville, NC,
looks up Cox Motor Company and take a look around.
Have a great day!

David Kelly
