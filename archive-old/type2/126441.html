Yeah. I'm not worried about a dirty engine (since there's no fins to
keep clear), so just keeping the rad clean is necessary, and keeping
an eye on the carb linkages.

I've been thinking about the intake however. I don't want to be
sucking the dirt through the carb. A good solution would be to use one
of the side scoops as a fresh air intake, sealing it to the air
cleaner. Or running a large plastic hose up to the scoop opening
itself. Either would probably work...

I briefly considered some kind of filter at the radiator, but I don't
want to restrict the air flow at all...
