Subject: junkyards and Westy costs

Two quick questions...

First, can anyone share with me what the cost of a 71 bus was new...how about 
with the Westfalia conversion? Just curious how much of a difference the 
Westy was.

Second, Bob on the list mentioned a &quot;junkyard&quot; in Elkridge, MD near 
Baltimore..anyone have any info on this yard...I really need to see if they 
have a door for my Ghia and some misc. parts for my westy...

By the way, spent the Whole day yesterday sanding and painting tin and misc 
parts for my engine rebuild, flushing the old engine which blew a valve, and 
cleaning the engine bay...I will spend most of the day today starting the 
rebuild with help from a good friend. I must note this does not make my 
boyfriend very happy... I'm spending more time on VW's than with him as of 
late. I keep telling him, just a few more weeks (yeah, right!!!)

Thanks all,
Melissa
