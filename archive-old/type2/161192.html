That's punny.

&gt; There was fairly low compression on all 4 prior to this happening,  
&gt; and I had been thinking that a rebuild was in my future as is.  
&gt; Purchased the van 3 years ago with 110,000 miles on it, somewhere  
&gt; around 35k on a 'rebuild.' - but no documentation about the rebuild  
&gt; and since then have found some less than stellar PO repairs.
&gt;
&gt; Ive put an additional 30k miles on the motor/bus since then,

65k on a rebuild is not bad but it depends on what was paid or how  
the bus was treated/serviced.

&gt; On a trip 2 months back to the Santa Cruz MT's, we had 4 humans  
&gt; (large) and 2 dogs (XL) and all of our gear and the van had some  
&gt; serious trouble climbing hills (not suprisingly, but worse than id  
&gt; usually expect) - when we finally slowed you could hear some pretty  
&gt; loud 'clack clack clack' sounds as i accelerated, eventually going  
&gt; away after topping off the oil and driving around the block a few  
&gt; times. im guessing there was some damage done then as well.

It sounds like the P&amp;C are shot so you might as well rebuild.

&gt; Unlike many rebuilders, AVP doesn't look at the core as another way  
&gt; to collect fees from customers. If your core can be used and has  
&gt; some damage, they will simply charge you for the labor to repair  
&gt; the case, if it can be.

If that's the case they won't have any trouble refunding the core fee  
upon inspection whether or not you have an engine built because they  
are paying for your core parts.

I find that most rebuilders use another case in practice because the  
core is sent in after the new owner has taken delivery of the rebuilt  
engine. It's more the exception that your case will be returned as  
your rebuild.

By holding onto the case, rebuilders have something to dip into when  
there is an immediate warranty issue. Often when you ask for your  
core back immediately you get told that they haven't looked at it yet  
and may take up to 90 days.

Anyway, that's my comment about the industry.

&gt; It'll depend on what we find when we split the case, but they said  
&gt; even if the pickup tube connector or whatever it is that can break  
&gt; when I overtighten the strainer bolt, is cracked, its only about an  
&gt; hour repair at about $50 labor, so it's still worth the $350  
&gt; partial core charge. (ok, minus another $65-80 for frieght) - -  
&gt; even if I only end up with around $200-$250 in a core return fee,  
&gt; after damage and frieght, what's it worth for me to keep it?

It that scenario plays out, then you are out of pocket an extra  
$100-150 which is a pittance in the overall R&amp;R cost.

As I understand it, the main issue with damage to that part of the  
case is support for the camshaft which is right above may have  
deformed as well. In that case, I don't think $50 is going to cover  
the costs of repair and I've never head of a linebore of the camshaft  
(the non-std size bearings are not common either).

Second, what condition is the camshaft in after this damage? Most of  
the rebuilders in that price range reuse the camshaft if there is  
enough metal on the lifter contact surface.

All of these are just guesses until everything is measured.
