Subject: Re: [T2] fuel gauge sending unit

&gt; Hey folks, on my 74 SC, the fuel gauge registers accurately when the tank 
&gt; is full and down about 6-8 gallons...when it gets to between 1/2 and 3/4 
&gt; full, the gauge very rapidly (like within 5-10 miles) falls down to 
&gt; completely empty.  Does that sound like the gauge or a faulty sending 
&gt; unit?  None of the manuals tell how to check for &quot;partial&quot; performance of 
&gt; the gauge.  Thanks, greg

sounds like the sending unit, probably a broken wire on the pot.
