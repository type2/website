Which style of pulley are you using? If you still have the cast pulley it
won't work.

Subject: [T2] A Different Alternator Conversion Problem


Hello Listers:

I've been building a new engine for my 71 Bus, and decided to switch to an
alternator.  I ordered one of those alternator conversion kits from a
mail-order place that advertises in the VW magazines, and was initially
happy with the quality of the parts in the kit.  Over the weekend, I put the
fan backing plates(that came with the kit) together with the fan and
alternator, then bolted this assembly onto the fan shroud.  Since the engine
is on a wheeled rack that sits on the floor, I can stand over the engine and
look down at the top of it.  In doing this, I noticed that the pulley on the
alternator doesn't line up with the crankshaft pulley.  I fact, it looks
like it may be off nearly a half-inch.  Is this acceptable?  I'm afraid the
pulley belt will spin off.  So did the vendor I bought the kit from give me
the wrong alternator stand?  When I push the alternator as far toward the
fan shroud as it will go, it butts up against the alternator stand and
leaves that half-inch mis-a!
lignment between the pulleys.  Does anyone know what the fix for this
problem is??

Thanks,

Jim Hood
71 Bohemoth Panel Bus
