Subject: RE: The Saga of the Free Westy

Jeff,

FYI -- looks like the state of VA provides a clear process for you to
obtain title to this vehicle via the property owner.  If I were in your
position, I'd want to work with the property owner to follow these
steps.

Good luck!

- Miles


http://www.dmv.state.va_dot_us/webdoc/citizen/vehicles/abandoned.asp:

&gt; If a vehicle is abandoned on private property (46.2-1208), the 
&gt; property owner can request ownership information from DMV by 
&gt; completing the form CRD93 and paying a $8.00 fee. Upon receipt of the 
&gt; ownership information, the property owner is responsible for notifying

&gt; all persons having interest in the vehicle (i.e., lienholder, owner), 
&gt; of the vehicle's status by registered or certified mail, (return 
&gt; receipt requested) and advising them to reclaim and remove their 
&gt; vehicle within thirty days. If this does not occur, the property owner

&gt; may apply for a certificate of title in his name. [ snip ] If the 
&gt; property owner/garage is applying for title, the following must be 
&gt; submitted with their application (VSA17A) for title:
&gt; 
&gt;    1. VSA-40, &quot;Affidavit of Compliance Under Abandoned Motor Vehicle
Act&quot;.
&gt;    2. If registered in Virginia, a copy of the CRD93 or DMV transcript

&gt; of the vehicle &gt; record showing the last registered owner and lien
holder; or [ snip ]
&gt;   3. Signed receipts for registered or certified mail that notified 
&gt; the owners(s) and
&gt; lienholder(s) of the location of the vehicle and your intention to
apply for a
&gt; Virginia title if not claimed 30 days after notice.
&gt;    4. If registered/certified mail is returned as &quot;undeliverable&quot;,
attach it to this
&gt; form UNOPENED.
