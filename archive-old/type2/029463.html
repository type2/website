Well, the penetrating oil might unsieze the cylinders, but then you are
left with the aftermath.  Your cylinders are rusty and you'll have rust
particles in the oil.  This does not bode well for the future of the
engine.

I really don't see any way to get away without at least pulling the heads
and cylinders.  The bottom end is probably in good shape, but if you run
the engine without cleaning up the cylinder problem you risk ruining the
bottom end as well.

Sorry to be the bringer of bad news, but sometimes it is better to bite
the bullet than it is to fire it up and hope for the best!
