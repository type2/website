Subject: Re: Throttle Plate Opening on PDSIT 32-34 carbs

Barry spakes thusly (more or less):

&quot;...Bingo!!  Since I work in a paperless government contracting office,
that means we have reams and reams of paper !!  A ream of paper has 500
sheets, and approximately measures 2&quot; thick!!!  So, one sheet of paper
is approximately 0.004&quot; thick (well, at that measure, I guess I should
say 'thin')...&quot; and then proceeded to start slapping himself around for
being nonsensical...

What the *$%&amp;_at_!

Ya know - I've taken my fair ration of chit-ohs on this esteemed list
for being unintelligible, vague, ambiguous and whatever OTHER adjectives
&amp; invective can be hurled at me by other speakers and writers of the
Anglish Languish, but this takes the cake :-)  Is it the Friday Funnies?
Or have you mad-cap stewards of the the public trust been doing lines of
the copy machine toner again?  I mean if we've told you once, we've told
you a thousand times - the color laser toner is the stuff; first the
magenta, THEN the cyan!  The copy machine toner gives you drain bamage.
Or memory loss.  Or, umm, what's that other thing called?  Oh, never
mind...

Last night I saw this great pic-a-ture over on the 914club site: it's
this little bunny wabbit with a pancake on his little head - the caption
reads something like &quot;I have no idea WTF you are talking about, so
here's a bunny wabbit with a pancake on his head...&quot;  ROTFLMAO!

Barry, ol' buddy, ol' pal - do you not have a feeler gauge with a .004
blade on it?  And if not, why not?  Why on this green earth would you
need a micrometer to set the throttle plates?  Did I take too much
antacid in the '60s?  And if that doesn't do the trick...  &lt;insert bus
content here&gt; I found out that the cellophane tops on my microwaveable
lunch entrees miked out at .001&quot; - perfect for checking the Type 4
center main bearing saddle for collapse...  Four pieces should do the
trick!

Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go find my picture of a bunny wabbit
with a pancake on his head.  Eh?  What's that you say?  I have a yellow
banana stuck in my ear?  Terribly sorry, my good man, I can't make out a
word you're saying - I have this yellow banana stuck in my ear...

You know - I'm the lemon merchant, and so that means you can be the
keeper of the cheese for today...  and if we all keep really-really
quiet they won't release the marmosets.

TGIF
