Subject: Re: [T2] Getting ready to pull rear brake drum and have a few questions...

I appreciate the righteous concern, Dave, but I'm not *that* stoopid. I 
actually *knew* (emphasis on knew) a guy who's vehicle dropped on him (not a 
bus, but heavy enough to do the job).

At first glance it looked like I wouldn't have to crawl under the bus to get 
this done (which is why I asked), but the more I look, the more I think I'll 
be doing some crawling. Jack stands will most definitely be used.

Later,

Sean

&gt;
&gt; &gt; 5. I've got a floor jack, but no stands. I'm planning on doing one side 
&gt;at a
&gt; &gt; time. Do I really need to buy a set of stands for this?
&gt;
&gt;Possibly not. But first, ask yourself a few questions:
&gt;1  Do you feel LUCKY ?
&gt;2. Is your blood type TATTOOED on your forehead and ankle ?
&gt;3. Do you have a &lt;insert favorite body part &gt; you don't NEED ?
&gt;4. Do you have a WILL ?
&gt;Why did you ask this question ?
&gt;Perhaps you should reconsider doing your own repairs.
&gt;Here's the Bentley suggestion:
&gt;&quot;Never work under a lifted car unless it is supported on stands
&gt;designed for the purpose. Do not support the car on cinder blocks.
&gt;Never work on a car that is supported solely by a jack.&quot;
&gt;&quot;If you are going to work on a car on the ground, make sure the
&gt;ground is level. Block the wheels to keep the car from rolling.
&gt;Disconnect the battery negative terminal to prevent others from
&gt;starting the car while you are under it. &quot;
&gt;
&gt;Use cheap inferior unstable stands and try to kid yourself.
&gt;Give the bus a real good push and see if it drops.
&gt;If money is a problem , then BORROW some GOOD jack stands.
&gt;&lt; end rant &gt;
