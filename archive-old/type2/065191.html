&gt;Hey There. I have a '77 Bus for which I would like to get a 
&gt;rebuilt engine. First thing I need to know, however is how to 
&gt;figure out which size engine it is (1700,1800,2000).  

If you have the correct engine, it is a 2 liter.  Look for the 
engine code on the fan shroud, towards the rear of the engine.  
Should begin with GD.  If it begins with GE it is also a 2 liter, 
but from a '78/79.
