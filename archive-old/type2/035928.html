Subject: Junkyard Trip

I took a trip down to Hyannis on Cape Cod Saturday to check out a place
called Bugs Busses and Things that I had heard about on this list. I
took a left on Hinckley road right before the Barnstable Airport rotary.
About 50 feet on the left was an alley with some busses and bugs at the
far end. This turned out to be the place. They do complete restoration
for all air cooled VWs and sell new and used parts. They really are not
a junk yard but have the place stuffed full of parts. I was able to get
an outside handle for my sliding door and an engine hatch cover in
really nice shape. I just missed out by a week on getting the
sink/fridge unit I need for my 70 westy. I will call back again to see
if they get one. Two guys run the place. They were friendly and
talkative. They seemed to know the local new-england VW scene pretty
good, and told me of a parts bus for sale in the Boston area. All in all
a successful trip. If you come down the Cape they are worth checking
out. The Address is 4 Hinckley road, Hyannis MA. Phone # (508)778-4300.

Jeff, 70 westy
