Subject: Re: deck ht

&gt; I still have a few questions - head volume - how do you measure? -Do use
&gt; use water? Also when the heads are rebuilt, I would envision that the

Cut a disk out of Plexiglas or similar stiff, clear material. Make it
the correct diameter to fit in the cylinder hole in your head. Drill a
small hole or two that will allow you to fill the head with a syringe. 

I used vegetable oil... draw it up in the syringe and make a note of how
much is in there. Inject it slowly under the disk to fill the combustion
chamber until you've eliminated all bubbles. Subtract what's left in the
syringe from what you started with, and you've got the volume of the
combustion chamber.

The pistons I'm using on the 1800cc have raised sections (I call them
domed, but they are really plateaued). To factor these in, I took some
modeling clay, pressed it over the plateaus, and used the Plexi
disk/veggie oil to calculate the volume that must be subtracted from the
combustion chamber for the deck ht. calculation. You could do the
opposite with your pistons if you really want to factor in the
concavity.

I'm at 7.3:1, which is still a touch high from what I've read. It looks
like it will be okay with 92 octane gas, which of course is premium and
not available everywhere. I cracked the previous heads because I didn't
perform the deck height exercise... expensive mistake... won't do that
again!
