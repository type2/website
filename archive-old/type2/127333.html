Subject: Re: corrections

&quot;1. That first thing isn't an intake boot, it's an
offset tube to allow 
the heater blower fan tube on the right side clear the
air cleaner.  It 
connects to the right heat exchanger through a hole in
the tin.

2. I think the intake boot is the same for all FI
models, 75-79, not 
just 78-79.&quot;

--Uff Da! (oh sh*t) Thanks Jason. I do have three but
my son is the digi photographer between the two of us.
(blame it on the kid... thats why we have them..
right?)
I didnt even notice when I posted.. thanks.
I dont run FI and that was what years the boots were
listed for but you are probably right.
