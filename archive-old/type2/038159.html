Subject: Re: Valve Cover Gaskets

Sorry, I'm new to some things.  What exactly does valve adjustment
involve?  I've seen the postings on it, but what exactly do you do?  How
does it affect the engine?  All that good stuff, never done it before,
I'm just a (very) basic engine guy, I don't think I've ever taken the
valve covers off.
