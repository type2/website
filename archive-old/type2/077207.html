Subject: Re: [T2] Engine-neering - combustion chamber question


&gt; Was it wasteful? Dunno - however I do know that my 120 HP 1966 Mustang with 
&gt; a 200 c.i. 6 cylinder was much more powerful than my 90 HP 1981 Mustang 
&gt; with the same 200 c.i. 6 cylinder. In other words they choked the engine 
&gt; down with emissions equipment to make it cleaner. It had the air pump too. 
&gt; I doubt that they would have reduced the HP if they didn't have to make it 
&gt; that way. Gas mileage was a bit worse than the 1966 which was very worn out 
&gt; and geared lower.
&gt; 

Also note however that between 1966 and 1981 the manufacturers also
changed very significantly the way they measured horsepower.  Back in the
'60s everything was gross horsepower.  That's the power of the engine with
no accessories.  Kind of an unrealistic estimate.

Later on (I don't know exactly when) they went to the current system which
is net horsepower, and that's where they measure horsepower with all the
accessories and exhaust on the engine.  So basically horsepower as the
engine is installed in the car.  Taking into account horsepower losses
from the power steering pump, fan, alternator/generator, etc etc.

So your old Mustang engine was probably a lot closer to 90 hp than that
120 hp number would have you believe.  Certainly power did go down
somewhat as compression ratios were lowered and emissions equipment was
added but before the current computer control technology existed which
allows for low emissions and high performance.  But the switch in
horsepower ratings needs to be given due credit too.
