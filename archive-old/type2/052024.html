&gt;had a &quot;positive&quot; experience at their local VW dealers...with service/parts?

My local dealer has been very helpful and has supplied me with many
original parts for my '73 bus.  Most recently, a brand new alternator cover
plate and gasket.

Before everyone rushes out to crucify VWOA, maybe we should find out what
their position really is instead of just speculating.  I suspect that they
are simply going after those who are putting the VW logo on coffee mugs,
T-shirts, and perhaps counterfeit parts.  If I were in their shoes, I would
do the same.  Why should someone else capitalize on their name, when VW was
the company that built the reputation (not to mention our busses) over
60-some-odd years?
