One word: IKEA! This is a great housewares store, I think that they might
only have stores in CA though, but they have really cheap stuff, so we
bought a carpet and then cut it to fit and it works really well. We had
originally though it would be really cool to put glow in the dark carpet in,
which exists-but is expensive. The same for wool carpeting, we even thought
of putting Astroturf, but that was almost the most expensive of them all, go
figure! Unfortunately you cannot order online from ikea_dot_com but in my
opinion IKEA is worth a trip to sunny ca!

Subject: [T2] carpet for westfalia

can anyone tell me where I can find carpet for my 79 Westfalia? All I
can seem to find is for non-westfalia buses. Also, is there a better
way to get new carpet in a bus, or do most people just go the precut
way?

thanks.
todd.
