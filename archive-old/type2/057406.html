   Not a joke at all -- look at any sandrail or dunebuggy. Super hopped
up (which naturally means hotter running) engines and they definitely
don't have sealed engine compartments. Also look at VW powered aircraft
-- no cooling tin at all, or even fans. I also ran a VW powered sawmill
for many years -- only minimal cooling tin.
And that, BTW, was like having your car sitting in one spot all day
long, no airstream from forward movement like you do in a vehicle.
