Subject: Re: Fair price to rent a bus

Den,

Yeah....this subjects been done before, too.


Count me out. My bus is just that....&quot;my&quot; bus. It
ain't for *rent*, or *sale*. I don't want *ANYONE*
driving it but &quot;me&quot;!!!

It's kinda like &quot;renting&quot;, or *selling* a family
member. Hmmmmm...Not Gonna Happen!

Thanks, but no thanks.
