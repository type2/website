Subject: Was tires- no locker or LSD

Thread apparently moot.  I just talked to Weddle
Engineering and they said Lockrights haven't been
available for the T2 tranny for several years. 
Original ZF's lockers weren't sold in US, but
were available in euro spec vehicles.  He sees
one every few years and they are usually shot
beyond repair.
