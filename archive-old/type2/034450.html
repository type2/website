Subject: gl-4/5

ok well i still dont pretend to know anything about anything , but since
i have had the last two weeks off cuz im a school teacher, i did some of
my own research. seems that according to some names in the gear oil
industry ( i didnt recognize any of them since i follow hockey instead
of the gear oil times)  :-) it seems that as many of you have so
graciously posted that its true! gl-5 does have some additives that
those that are they have said (may wear down the synchros in the
transmission) funny nobody would really put a finger on it or come right
out and say it on the sites i looked at, but it does appear that gl-5
just isnt the &quot;stuff&quot; eh? and i know that some of you are using it with
success (i'll cross my fingers for ya) but im going to warm my oil up
and DRAIN it. then find me some nice gl-4 to replace it and be on my
merry way. with that out of the way, should my rebuilt purr right on
initial start up or is there a reason it seems like it is a tad rough.
posted earlier may be i'm just not used to the sound of this one. 71
dual port 1600 stock (sorta) it has a pertronix but other that that
stock. checked timing with a light 5 degrees after tdc- all wahrs hooked
up-carb screws checked idle about 900 oh it has a 009 all vacuum lines
blocked off no intake leaks no exhaust leaks. going to go run it around
the block after i check the valves. will let you know!

p.s. it really isn't the new millenium yet but happy new year!
