Safe is a relative term. If you have tools that shouldn't get too hot
(plastic stuff), don't put 'em in the engine compartment. If you will
block airflow by putting them there, don't put them in the engine
compartment. If you want to be able to retrieve your tools in case of an
engine fire, don't put them in the engine compartment. I can't imagine a
convenient place for tools in the engine compartment.  Joe
