And yet another alternative.....

Some of us have had excellent results with the 185R14 [Reinforced] Jupiters
available at Les Schwab and many other outlets.  These are available in a
6-ply and an 8-ply rating.  Load capacity and inflation specs exceed VW
numbers. The performance in the wet is above average, the price runs in the
$50.00 to $60.00 per tire range, and the wear and handling are very good.
Especially at Les Schwab, the service and warranty are unbeatable.

FWIW.....
