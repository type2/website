Subject: Re: New electrical problem?

I thnk you need a new guru.  If there was something internal to the battery, then
it would require changing the battery.

If replacing the cables fixed the problem, then one of the cables may have had
a bad connection.  I say may, because it could still be somehting else.

I would suspect the wire that goes from the ignition/starter switch (key) to the
starter.  There are a few splices and connectors along the way and one of them
could be intermittent.

Good luck

&gt; Hey, Guys:

&gt;
&gt; It turns out that I had something go wrong INTERNALLY in my battery that caused it to
&gt; break the circuit.  My VW guy replaced the pos and neg cables and the battery, and it
&gt; fired right up.  It was strange, because the Bus has been running and starting fine,
&gt; without any indication of a weak or moribund battery.  This is the first time in a
&gt; lifetime of driving that I have had this happen with a battery.
