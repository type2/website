&lt;&lt; The big thing to remember, while testing for a &quot;leak&quot; in your electrical
system.... make sure you have the dome lights off,, and if you have a radio 
with
preset memory,,, it will cause a small glow in the lamp also,, you might want 
to
disconnect it also. &gt;&gt;

Absolutely left field battery drain: Buddy of mine put a recycled radio in his
work truck. Same problem, every few days the battery would be flat. Turned
out to be a short in the auto antenna circuit...Thing was trying to raise a 
fixed
antenna...
