I've been re-thinking my tire situation and have contacted Discount Tire
national office with my complaint of them warrantying the original tires
I purchased with down graded lesser tires.

From my records I had the right tires seven years ago when I installed
them but with each warranty I was given lower quality tires as equal
under the warranty. In reality they been stickin it to me!

&quot; I would say that this is a case of &quot;ignorance is bliss&quot;

Well guys you've opened my eyes and I'm not at the least blissfull now,
I'm irate.
