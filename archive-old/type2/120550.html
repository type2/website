Subject: Re: [T2] Back to the PaintScratch

Michael..see my yesterday post on paintscratch, etc.
Here's the link I posted to their competitor (Paintworld) that sells it cheaper and has many colors.  I didn't see L63H right off the bat but they have many many VW colors.  You may want to call.  Hope this helps.  -Chris
