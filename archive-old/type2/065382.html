What is the downside of 79's? i understand tha the 77's don't have 
Hydraulic lifters, but i was under the impression that 78/79's were 
pretty much the same???

So I wrote:
Others have discussed the exhaust differences. I would only add that I
have owned a 79 and a 78, both in California. Both had a cat converter.
The '79 had an Oxygen sensor mounted at the U-bend in the exhaust system,
which feeds into the FI computer. I presume this adjusts fuel mix more
sensitively than the 78 computer, which does not have this. It's also
one more component to maintain I suppose.

Also, the 78 CA bus has an exhaust gas recirculation system that my 79
CA bus did not have. I have gone to considerable hassle and sometimes expense
to restore function to my egr for smog test purposes. A 79 CA bus would spare 
you that.

I infer from your address that you are in Michigan, so CA bus fixin's may be 
irrelevant to your case.

In Michigan, a gas heater would be a good accessory. With such a one, you could
let the old heater boxes rust away to ruin and still stay warm, I guess, because
you wouldn't need the weak stock heater system. Getting good replacement heater
boxes is pretty difficult in any case, especially in the rust belt. With gas 
heat, I probably wouldn't let the exhaust differences sway my decision.

The camping setup is identical and I was surprised to hear someone say the 79
was wider because I thought they were identical in body. I wonder about that.
The difference must be slight.

I've had both, and I think in either year getting the regular camping setup
with an icebox is better than the deluxe setup with an electric refrigerator
that is heavy, fills up storage space with a compressor to drive it, requires a
second battery to run, didn't work very well when it was new and often as not 
doesn't work at all today. I plan to remove all that jazz and convert my dead
fridge into an honest icebox with a drain hole.

These things are so underpowered anyway, I would think that air conditioning 
would be a bad idea. My air conditioner is a plant mister that my wife and I 
take turns misting each other's feet with. Works great!

If I had it to do all over again, I might look for a '71, especially one with 
an ASI poptop that gives you that great double bed upstairs. The double bed
on the late '70's buses is so superior to the little cot on the early '70's
Westfalia poptops, I think it makes all the engine hassles worthwhile.

Happy hunting,
Surfer Bob
