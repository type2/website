Subject: Re: [T2] grinding turns



&gt; 
&gt; hola list,
&gt; 
&gt; recently have begun hearing a low frequency but very loud vibration/grind/rub from the front end during low speed, moderately tight turns 
(i.e. pulling up the driveway).
&gt; what's going on?

Isolate the side and pull the wheel.  Look for obvious problems with the disk or pads.  If none, remove the caliper and pull the hub off.  
Your bearings might need attention.

George Lyle
