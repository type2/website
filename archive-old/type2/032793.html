Hi All!
    Just wondering...... :)
I just removed all the flooring in my 73. I previously removed the
paneling,sides and the headliner from my fiberglass roof. He's a beautiful
bare baby inside now. Thankfully NO RUST!!!  :) (I could scream it from a
mt!!) I have a little &quot;hatch&quot; in the floor that I believe is part of my
heating system(wich is missing a few this and thats) I plan on just covering
it up and forget I ever saw it, what was this used for? Is it a standard on
all buses to utilize the heating system for passenger Buses? Is there a dam
thing I could do with it? (He's a camper :) Anyway Im inches away from
installing all my R-13 insulation and new 1/4 panels and all that jazz. Kool
Patch is hard to come by here as are Q-pads. I plan on just laying down my
insulation and some padding under my new floor(wood slats!) after a coating
or two of rustoleum. Is there anything else I could do that Im missing? Also
are there any precautions or preventative measures I should take when
installing the wood floor? Im afraid of shifting in the hull and such that
would loosen up the boards. I purchased a tongue in groove kit form Home
depot. ($40 and beautiful!) and will install securely on a wood slat.
Anyone else ever install wood flooring? What was the outcome?
Thanks for reading all this and thanks for your time!
Ill post pics of all this when my fiancé comes back with my serial port
cable!!
