	Just my $0.02. The Bus Depot stands behind their products. Very
solidly in my experience. So do RMMW. I spread my business around
all the suppliers in the field, because I like having multiple sources. 
If you want full service lookup with the parts catalog, go to your dealer.
Buy some parts from them from time to time too. Consider yourself MORE
resposible for getting the right part when the price is lower, or the
shop smaller. Its your bus, its your money, its your job to get it right.
Sorry, but it is.

And don't forget Deming's fourth rule:
&quot;Cease doing business on the basis of price tag alone&quot;.
