&gt;&gt; In looking through the archives, it seems that (a) no one has had a
&gt;&gt; good experience with high temperature paints and (b) no one's posted
&gt;&gt; about it in a while. Has anyone that's had a more current experience
&gt;&gt; with POR20, BBQ paint, Eastwoods, VHT or any other manufacturer's high
&gt;&gt; temperature paint?

i've had good results with VHT only if the parts are sandblasted first. the
silver 1500 degree VHT works well, but if the parts are NOT blasted it will
just flake off. 

if you have new exhaust parts, or slightly used ones, ceramic coating is the
ticket. it adds a bunch of cost to the parts, but it seems to prevent
rusting more or less completely, which actually saves money in the long run.
after 2+ years including some ontario winter driving (slap, slap, bad owner,
you shouldn't do that to your bus...) my ceramic coated heater boxes and
muffler are still rust free.
