Subject: Re: [T2] CV joint troubles and history lesson...

Paul,

Describe &quot;clunk&quot;...not? clunk, clunk, clunk...but just clunk?

Jack driver side rear up after putting large wheel chocks on every other 
wheel....put car in 1'st at idle....assuming you haven't installed 
posi-trak&lt;grin&gt;.

Have a helper in the car when you do this and be ready to apply brakes.

Listen for clunk.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Been reading the recent posts on replacing CV joints with interest as I've spent the last 4 weekends
&gt; battling a loud click that is now a louder clunk.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm now a pro at this job as I've pulled, regreased and reinstalled all four joints.  The first one
&gt; took me about 10 hours (no, really - it took several hours for it to dawn on me that if I put the
&gt; car in neutral and took off the parking brake, I could spin the joint around enough to get at the
&gt; rest of the bolts...I can be REALLY slow sometimes...) but by the fourth one I had it down to an
&gt; hour.
&gt; 
&gt; So my drivers side outer joint was really chewed to bits.  I went out and bought two more (one for
&gt; road backup, as the list advises...), replaced the offending joint, and man, if that clunk didn't
&gt; get LOUDER.  Now I've removed and reinstalled the joint twice to no avail.
&gt; 
&gt; This weekend I'm gonna do some serious thinking about it.  What could be loose?  Dirty?  Could a bad
&gt; CV joint mess up some other nearby component like brakes or wheel bearings?
&gt; 
&gt; It's getting to the point where people on the street say &quot;Hey, how are you?&quot; and I start in with,
&gt; &quot;Well, there's this clunk...&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; HISTORICAL ANECDOTE:  I'm currently rereading Dava Sobel's book &quot;Longitude&quot;, which is the story of
&gt; the Englishman John Harrison's attempts to make a seagoing clock in the mid-1700's.  In the midst of
&gt; my CV joint misery I read the following:
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;A novel antifriction device that Harrison developed also survives to the present day - in the caged
&gt; ball bearings that smooth the operation of almost every machine with moving parts now in use.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe I should ask him about that clunk...
