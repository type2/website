Subject: [T2] Garage for rent?

Hi Chris and Matthew,
                       I'm not sure this is what you want to hear...  I looked 
into this a couple of years ago: the 'rent-a-space' places are quite 
expensive.  Let's say you want heat and enough room to work on all sides of 
your vehicle; then you will be competing with small (sub) contractors (like 
carpenters, plumbers, electricians) who base their businesses in their homes, 
but keep supplies, vehicles, etc in facilities like this.  The rent in our area 
was definitely prohibitive for 'hobby' pursuits.  You might check this out 
where you live, but I think you will be disappointed.... hope not!

high matthew not sure if anyone has a garage but a alternative could be 
checking into the little storage building sites that are all over the place for 
storing anything to boxes on up to boats and yachts....
 
i am sure you might be able to put your bus in one and work on it there ..
just a thought and trying to help.
peace and love 
chris

Hey, just getting back into busses after a couple year hiatus. Had to sell my
68 westy for financial reasons. Things are better. Hopefully aquiring a 70
westy in the near future for resto. Does anyone in the massachusetts
(merrimac valley/haverhill) area have some garage space I can use/rent? Drop
me a line, thanks!!! mlibby_at_mailshack_dot_com
