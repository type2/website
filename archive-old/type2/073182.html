&gt;&quot;I probably wouldn't be stuck in the mud right
&gt;now if I had a winch mounted on the front of my bus,&quot; I mused.

&gt;If not a
&gt;winch, what else would be a good emergency plan for times stranded in the
&gt;boonies?

A proper winch bumper would be a big welding project in a bus, and the
winch itself is expensive. It's a crime magnet (they fence easy). I don't
know how you could use it enough to justify the cost.

You can get a come-along at the Wal-Mart for about $25 although I would not
trust one of those for anything beyond light-duty pulling--cables snapped
under stress are damned dangerous.

There is a device called a &quot;Hi-Lift Jack&quot; that, along with some chain or
heavy cable, can do anything a winch can do and more, but more slowly. I
think they're less than $100. Very nice economical compromise if you only
get stuck twice a year.
