I have installed a BA6 from scratch in my '76, not too hard, as always make
sure you have ALL the parts as there as rare as rocking horse poo! Yes you
do plumb into the fuel system. You will want to look _at_ the archives &amp; follow
the library links as well as vintage bus, contact me if you want any more
info.

BTW

It's best to look in the archives &amp; library etc, BEFORE posting. That way
the information is better presented than a short reply (&amp; no one gets pi$$ed
off!)
