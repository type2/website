Subject: Re: [T2] Westfalia Parts

&gt;Opps, I just re-read your message and you said the cabinet is in the 
&gt;passenger side = SUICIDE cabinet!!
&gt;
&gt;If you are looking at a '73 or earlier setup, is is pretty much worthless.
&gt;
&gt;The suicide cabinet makes parallel parking absolutely impossible.

I disagree. I like the closet/cabinet. Suicide? Maybe, even if the cabinet 
wasnt there I would still have curtains there so it makes no difference. I 
come from the old school, I am used to not seeing out windows, and I use my 
mirrors.
