Subject: Re: [T2] distributor noise

[...] [...]
&gt; ugly noise.
&gt; 
&gt; [...]loud whining coming from, as near
&gt; as I can tell, the
&gt; distributor. &gt; noticed a lot of play in the shaft. &gt;

&gt; Can anyone comment on what the play should be, up
&gt; and down, on the
&gt; distributor shaft? Any other ideas what might cause
&gt; the loud whining?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;[...] The dist shaft will have some play in it up and
down, just make sure that the cap is on right and the
rotor is not hitting the cap, don't think this is the
soruce of the noise. Check the three bolts that hold
the air turbine on, while you are in there take your
alternator belt off and see if the noise will go away. Phil
