&gt; Hi Rob,
&gt;
&gt; As you increase the tire pressure you decrease the size of the contact
&gt; patch between the tire and the road.
&gt;
&gt; Here's the deal: A tire at 32PSI with a 1000 lb load on it gives you
&gt; 31.25 square inches of contact patch. Pump up the pressure to 40 PSI
&gt; and you are down to only 25 square inches of contact. Are you willing
&gt; to accept 25% less traction in your steering and braking???  I know I'm
&gt; not.  But as they say, your milage may vary.

I don't think that it is quite so simple.  The shear friction force
&quot;traction&quot; is dependent not only on the area but on the pressure between
the two surfaces.  If you reduce the contact patch you also increase the
pressure on the contact patch.  The two effects tend to cancel each other
out.  IIRC, autocross racers tend to run higher-than-normal pressures
while competing, which they wouldn't do if it harmed traction.

This page:

http://www.nhtsa.dot_dot_gov/cars/rules/rulings/TirePresFinal/FEA/TPMS3.html

if you scroll down to the bottom has some interesting coefficient of
friction data in table form for varying pressures, speeds, and wet and dry
surfaces

As far as hydroplaning goes, the three determinants of whether a tire is
going to hydroplane is the tire pressure, tire load, and tire width.
Greater pressures, loads, and narrower widths tend to resist hydroplaning
the most.

Pilots use the &quot;rule of thumb&quot; that hydroplaning will occur at a speed (in
knots) that is nine times the square root of the tire pressure in PSI.
Aircraft tires are relatively smooth and lightly loaded, so this rule is
overly conservative for automobiles, but the same square root relationship
exists.  If you double your tire pressure, you will increase the
hydroplane onset speed by a factor of 1.41

Being from SoCal, I tend to be very cautious in the rain.  I've never
pushed things to the point where hydroplaning became a concern.
