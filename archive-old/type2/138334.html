Subject: Heaters, heat exchangers, engine cooling, ventilation

The Propex Heater looks mighty fine. Compact, efficient and could 
actually heat a bus in our sub-zero temps here in the Great Lakes.

But I'm curious if having a remote heater that's ducted into the bus 
ventilation system removes the need for heat exchangers? If it were so, 
It would seem to me that if a bus needs new exchangers, the price of 
new exchangers would be better put toward a remote heater and the mods 
required to fit it into the duct system.

Is this feasible? Has anybody done this? With a gas heater or other?

What kind of modifications would have to be made to the heat exchanger 
and exhaust system to safely do this? Are non heat exchanger VW exhaust 
systems possible and still have proper engine cooling?

Although my experience and knowledge of buses pales in comparison to 
many on the list (I'm on the steep end of the curve) I have a fair 
amount of experience in sheetmetal work and ventilation.
