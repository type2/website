Subject: Help(Oil filters)



Hello,
     I recently had my 79 westy (2.0L) in a shop for a bit of work. While it was
in I had them fix my leaky oil screen gasket. Well to do that they did an oil
change of course. Now the leaking oil screen is fixed but has been replaced by
an even worse oil leak. I am talking serious dripping. Soo. Last evening I
crawled under and wipped the whole thing down and took off the  tin covering the
push rod tubes and Heads (hopefully you know what I mean). Then I had my
girlfriend start it up and give it some gas every now and then while I was under
with a flashlight checking things out. Low an behold, oil is streaming down out
of the same area where the Oil Filter is attached.  Now I know very little about
oil filters but I do know that when I last had her in  the shop that they
changed the oil filter. They put a MANN W920/17 Filter on. Does anyone have any
ideas whether or not this filter is compatible? Is it possible to get a bad
filter at times, or has it been seated poorly (like they forgot to put oil on
the rubber rim before scewing it in). I also checked to make sure that the
filter is tight and it is real tight.  I am definately going to take it out,
clean the area, and put in a new one in. Any suggestions on a perhaps, ohhhh, I
don't know..........A friggin BOSCH!! oil filter perhaps.

Thanks for you help in advance
