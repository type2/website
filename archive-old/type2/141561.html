Subject: Re: [T2] New concept van in Michelin Challenge with bus feel

How stupid am I, thinking that posting a link to a concept van that had the 
bus &quot;feel&quot; wouldn't end up in another big political blow up. For the record, 
that wasn't what I had in mind.

BTW George, most of the concepts in the challenge were electric, in a way 
that was part of the appeal to me, in that it was a possible future 
replacement for the bus which felt right, but fitted into the more 
eco-friendly requirements that I think will be the overriding rule in years 
to come. They're all a bit pie in the sky at the moment, but that one could 
be a possible future transport for me.

FWIW
