&lt;&lt; Stripped plug &gt;&gt;
Hello scot      there are replacement bushings for the plug holes stripped  
made by KD tools comes with a tap and different lenght inserts. can be 
installed with motor in the car,  tap then crank the engine with the plug out 
to remove any shavings. On buses I like to use heli coils  because they are 
smaller than the KD inserts and ther is more room to work than on a bug.
