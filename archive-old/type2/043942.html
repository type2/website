Subject: [T2] Type IV fan came loose.

I was headed to the beach in my 1972 7 seater.  After a week diagnosing carb
troubles and believing all was well.  About 10 miles out, the brake light
and gen light came on.  I figure, no problem, I have a spare belt.  I drive
to the next exit and park at a YMCA.  I pop the lid and see one hot engine.
Smoke everywhere, boiling oil sounds.  I notice the the fan protection grid
is out of whack and the timing ruler, too.  The belt is intact.  I then
notice that the fan is out of position.  I grab it, with a rag, it being all
hot and all, and it is completely loose.  I take my time, remove the belt,
let if cool, and pop off the plastic cone and find the bolt is loose.  I
take out the bolt, it looks fine.  I then try to position the fan, but I
find no definite position.  Knowing that that fan has to be somewhat
precisely positioned, having the timing mark on i, I tried to determine
where it blonged, by feel.  I just twisted it until it seemed secure and
rebolted into position.  The engine started and ran fine.  I was almost
tempted to go to the beach anyway, but I opted for the pool instead.  It
seems to be running fine, thank goodness.  But how do I reposition this fan?
Are there other issues that are being overlooked by me.  I was very glad to
be able to fix it and continue on.  It is running very nice and cool.
