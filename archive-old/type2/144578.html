&gt; AS you guys know, I'm all about the tire and oil

&gt; same as SAE30 at operating temp--which of course
&gt; is almost all the time you have your engine
&gt; running-- why is there a rush to lower viscosity
&gt; base oil in the name of fuel economy?

Because the hot number used to be &quot;40&quot;, but now it is 30 or 20.  The cold
number gets correspondingly lower to improve mileage during warmup, which
is a significant portion of most vehicles' driving cycles.
