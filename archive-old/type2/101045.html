Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel gauge won't go to 1/1

I had similar problems when I replaced my fuel tank sender; the gauge
would max out at somewhere between 3/4 and 1/1 with a full tank.  After
all that monkeying around, though, I wasn't about to go back and try to
fine tune the system!

As I recall, the sender was simply a potentiometer (variable resistor).
As the float moves, the resistance reading changes.  To get a better
reading, you'd probably have to bend the float or somesuch, so that the
resistance reading at the sender matches what the gauge expects the &quot;full&quot;
resistance to be.  You may want to play around with the sender wire and a
potentiometer from Radio Shack.  Since I don't have the wiring diagram
in front of me, I'd guess that it works like this:

                               ^
                              /
 +12 ----  gauge --------/\/\/\/\-----+
                            /         |
                        (sender)    --+--
                                     ---
                                      -
By using another pot, you could determine what values that the gauge
expects for various readings (you'll need a multimeter).  Then, you could
test your sender and see if it produces those values.  If the sender does
produce those values, then it is a matter of tuning the float.  If the
sender does not produce those values, you may need to monkey with the
resistance by adding a series resistor or something (depends on the
situation).

If you're up for this, more power to ya!  I just left well enough alone
with mine and was glad that the gauge didn't drop to empty after I'd
burned through only half tank!
