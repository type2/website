Subject: the lurker speaks!

fellow list members,

O.K., I admmit, I've lurked for awhile now but for good reason.  I've been
looking for the perfect bus for cheap!  While it may not be perfect, I think
the price might be right.  The bus in question is a 1964 deluxe.

Any advise in evaluating this bus would be appreciated.  Rust is not a huge
deal, although it is a problem around one of the passenger side rear
windows, a moderately small dent on the front, other than that the body
seems to be in
*relatively* decent shape.  The engine is a 1600cc unit apparently fairly
recently rebuilt.  The owner claims the battery has died from sitting awhile
and is recharging it so I can drive it this week.  Should I be overly
concerned about this?  

Interior is in relatively good shape, (except for the spare engine sitting
inside it!).  

My observations are all from observation as it sat where I saw it with the
for sale sign in the window.  The current owner is asking $1700 for it which
is right up my financial alley!  Any advise would be appreciated.  I plan to
give it a test run on Wednesday.

Thanks,

Dave
