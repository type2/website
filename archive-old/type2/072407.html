I am trouble shooting my '76 2000 FI (CA model) with a Pertronix 
Igniter in place of points. It won't start.

The other night it as I drove off it was acting sluggish so I turned 
right around and parked it till it was light enough to trouble shoot. 
The next day she wouldn't start. It turns over okay, but no start.

It seems I am getting fuel, I can smell vapor from unburned gasoline 
in the exhaust when I turn it over and there is pressure in the 
injector ring. It sounds like I am not getting any spark so I started 
looking for loose connections and such.

Inside the distributor is a copper ground wire and this is frayed 
almost all the way through. It looks to me that the vacuum advance 
lever had been abrading it.

Could this frayed wire be the problem? If so has anyone repaired it?

For $60.00 some I could get a new distributor, and that may be better 
than repairing something that is almost wore out anyway. However, I 
am not clear on which distributor I should obtain. For my model year 
and engine I see 009 and 050 distributors, which is preferable?

Have a good day.
