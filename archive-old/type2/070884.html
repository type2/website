I know its the fuel pump because I've replaced every other component of the 
fuel system.

&lt;&lt; Hi Shawn
 
 Why have you decided that the fuel pump is not working? I went through this
 with intermittent cutting out, and bought a new pump, but when i checked the
 old one it seemed be OK. Anyway I then went and got an electric pump from a
 scrap yard. You need a different sort depending on whether its carbs or FI.
 I can't tell you about FI but I believe they run at a higher pressure. The
 carb type pump hums constantly and I presume stops pumping when the needle
 valve on the carb shuts.
 
 My cutting out was improved but not cured, as I had a piece of paper in the
 tank which kept getting sucked up to the outlet. No amount of tank draining
 would help this until I got the tank out, but I tried everything else first.
