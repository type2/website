I just got back from the thing in Sacramento that I am not supposed to
mention and bought the 68-69 manual for $25. The guy seemed to have a
lot of books/manuals etc. No web site but - Vintage Motorbooks
P.O. Box 922, Beaverton, Oregon 97075-0922 Phone is 503-292-7747 and 24
hour fax is 503-292-5636. I also saw this book at
http://www.bentleypublishers_dot_com/product.htm?code=V279 and http://www.busdepot_dot_com/ASP/books.asp?PartType=M&amp;VehCod=C&amp;B1=Search
Hope this helps!
