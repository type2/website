I'm copying this to the type2 list to keep Charlie happy. :-)

Before I went on my Texas road trip, I printed out the AIRS lists for
each state I was passing through (geographically, that is). At the time
it was more for &quot;the mojo factor&quot; because this voyage was intended to be
a cruise -- carefully planned and uneventful. Shuffleboard on Tuesday,
water aerobics on Wednesday -- like that. Which it was, until an
apparently despondent deer crossed my path on the first leg of my way home.

So here I am, in the dark, in the middle of Texas hill country, trying
to figure out what this wet stuff is all over the inside of my cab
(windshield washer fluid -- whew!). I didn't even have time to panic, it
happened so fast. Everything seemed to be rolling okay, so I drove on
until I could find a place to camp for the night. This turned out to be
a rest area about 20 miles east of Sonora.

It was a little late to call back to Art Lynch (with whom I'd had dinner
just a few hours before), so I called David S. who is two hours earlier
and ran down my plan to get the bus looked over in San Angelo. He gave
me the number for his friends Rob &amp; Kim (from his Mustang life). It was
the next morning that I called Art and he steered me to Rex Rogers in
San Angelo, who's number was a typo -- oops! 

It was on the way into San Angelo that the bus started running badly and
actually stalled at one point (when the idle solenoid stripped out?).
Jim, a stranger on the side of the road, stopped to help and followed me
on to the next town Eldorado. He and Rob hooked me up with John Talley
at J&amp;O in San Angelo. John got my carburetor hooked back up. He's honest
and nice! And he knows VWs. His dad had the local VW dealer back in the
day and he worked there before starting his own business.

I never did get hooked up with Rex, but Art's assistance was invaluable
-- and I'm still stunned that Mike G. was ready to bring me an engine if
it came to that. David and Art got me through my first valve adjustment.
I was really nervous about getting on the road out of San Angelo, but I
made it home just fine -- another 27 hours of driving! Knowing I had
that support network on the way home made all the difference to me. And
made my parents very happy. Even now, with me at 40, my mom still
worries.... :-) The big difference is that now, I *let* her....
