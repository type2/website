There was a tear in the Right side outer boot and  rust and water that were present.   I swapped the right
side assembly after repacking the newer ones and installed them.  Steve was right there were two different bolt
heads.  Some 6mm Hex and some Torx drive.   A few stripped but luckily, Mr Vice-Grip stepped in when he was needed
and everything was fine.  One of the easier jobs on the westy.

Every time I work on these vehicles, I am amazed at the quality engineering.
When I was a mechanic in the 80's we cursed many an engineer for the North American manufacturers.  Too little
room, too many parts to remove to get to the problem,...  &quot;Yeah sure, we'll remove the dash assy. to work at the
heater core...

Thanks for the tips folks.
