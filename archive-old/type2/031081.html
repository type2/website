great oil, I have used 100% synth, since 1975
&gt; 
&gt; I have a fresh rebuild and the 500 mile oil change to do and wonder what
&gt; grade I should use. There was 5w-30, 10q-30, and 15w50. Should I use the
&gt; 10w-30 for the cooler seasons coming?

Don't use synthetic until AFTER your 3,000 mile break in, it lubes too
well and the cyl won't hone themeselves in.

I use 5-50 year round
