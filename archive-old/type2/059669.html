Subject: re: sunroofs seals...

Oh yeah.  One more thing.

The silicone is not really to hold the seal on, the seal does a good job
of that by itself, just like any pinchwelt.....its mostly there as
insurance a few years down the road, when it begins to get old, to keep it
from coming off as easy......;p
