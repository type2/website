&gt; Chris/Scott,
&gt; 
&gt; Guys, maybe this is the time to improve on the bushings

yes, good idea. the type of bearing that is inside the nose cone would work
perfectly. one the reasons we started germansupply_dot_com is to make new parts
where there is a need, and we are going to put that on the list of r&amp;d
projects.

when i did my bushings (&quot;badminton birdies&quot;) the rears were dirty, but in
fine shape. i actually purchased all new ones, but re-used the old ones
because the repops were so poorly made and ill-fitting.

what i did do was clean the tube really well, which involves using an
electricians fish tape, solvent and some rags. back and forth many times
until the rags were clean. sparing grease on the cleaned up rod/bushing, and
new dust boots. the dust boots i got are a repop by wolfsburg west, and they
look perfect when new, but they split on me in less than 12 months. drag
that replacement parts are such crap sometimes.

i probably sound like a busted record at this point, but the best thing to
do to get really accurate shifting is fork out the $ for a berg shifter. i
did all the bushings, super cleaned everything and with the stock shifter,
it was still very unsatisfying. i bought the berg shifter and it made the
difference i was looking for.
