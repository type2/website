Subject: Re: [T2] erratic clock

LOL!

Yes, and I can remember when I actually *repaired* 180k capacity 
floppy disk drives cause they cost $200/each.  Now you buy 1.2mb drives 
for $20 each and thow them away when they get bad...*if* you even get one 
with your new computer  these days.

The wonders of modern robotic/factory production.

Anyone know what a standard new Brazillian bus cost in equivalent dollars 
these days?

Cheers, dave

&gt; The local electric/electronic repair shop near me 
&gt; charges $65 as a basic fee for opening the box and
&gt; diagnosing any repairs...With a new am/fm CD radio
&gt; available from the big box stores at about $99, it's
&gt; no wonder most radio/stereo equipment is just r 'n
&gt; r'd instead of being repaired... ;-(
