Subject: Need westy panel clips

Hi folks:

I need some of those chrome westy door panel clips - the kind that hold
the wood panels to the sliding door and the hatch.  Round silver heads
about the size of a dime, with regular clip bottoms like standard door
panel clips.  I need about 20 of them.

Reason: my westy's driver/passenger door panels were shot, so I made
some new ones out of spare birch panels from a junkyard hardtop westy
donor.  They look great using the regular door panel clip holes, but of
course I can't use that kind of &quot;blind&quot; clips.

Anyone have any to spare or (unlikely) know a source for new ones?

Thanks,
Joe
