&quot;The starter seems very very very weak...not enough power to do much more
than slowly turn engine.  The PO had used the hot post to connect a variety
of wiring to a hot lead.  I disconnected all this stuff temporarily and it
seemed a little better.  After a moment or so of cranking (hoping it might
just fire up)the starter was hot enough to fry bacon (or sausage) on.&quot;



        I  just had  the same problem with the 73. Engine reinstalled. Go to
start and very weak turning over and really dropped the battery voltage. I
put in a rebuilt and it was bad! Went with another rebuild(it happened to be
longer with a
different part number which Bently says is Ok to use.) that ,and repair the
idle air cuttoff solinoid for the L/H carb,it starts stong now:)

Think this maybe what you need.
