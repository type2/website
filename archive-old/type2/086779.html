Subject: Re: [T2] 78' Westy Stool Wanted


My '79 has the stool, it is just a wooden box with a fabric-covered hinged
lid.  You could use it for a trash can, I do.  Also helps getting into the
pop-top.

The two plastic buckles are the tie-downs for the stool so that it is
secured while driving.  See the '78 camper manual I have up at

&gt; Anyone have the correct stool for a 78' that they want to part with? I
&gt; think it goes between the front seats and maybe there is a small trash can
&gt; too? Anyone know about this stuff? Also is this what the two plastic
&gt; buckle/like pieces are for that are on the front seat pedestals in between?
&gt; They look just like the ones on the dash that hold the small table that
&gt; goes there.
