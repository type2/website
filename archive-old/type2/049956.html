Volks,

I have it worked out, thanks to Dr. Tim, Mark Dearing, and OrangeVW.  It
turns out that there are *4* different pressure plates that will fit a
1600DP engine!  And as far as I can tell, none are interchangable.  We
went out yesterday and bought the proper pressure plate, installed it, and
the trans and engine are now connected just fine.  By luck, I have
pictures of three out of the four flavors of pressure plate, and will be
posting them next week.
