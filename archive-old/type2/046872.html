Subject: [T2] Odd nuts on 1.8 DC heads

T2'ers,

I just bought a spare 1.8 dual carb long block for the heads.

Starting to take the heads off, I trial fit a couple of sockets...a 15mm just 
won't quite go. A 16mm is very loose. I give it a twist with the 16mm socket 
and the socket slips. Trying it on a couple of others gives the same results. 
15mm is .059+, 16mm is .63+...tried a 5/8ths SAE; it slipped also.

What size are these dudes?
