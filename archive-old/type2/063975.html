Subject: Another Heating Idea?

Long Story made Short
- ------------------------

Has anyone considered using an Eberspacher DL-1 (Diesel) heater as opposed
to a BN-4?  

Description -- The DL-1 is the Diesel burning version of the Eberspacher.
It is very compact and puts out a lot of btu's (don't have stats w/me but
it's MORE than enough to heat any VW)  It has a therostat and pulls about 
3 amps.   

Here's my brainstorm!
- ---------------------

I've been reading the various thread about heating and thought I'd share my
own brainstorm about heating my '67 Bus in the cold Michigan winter.

My dad works for a trucking company and recently came across some Eberspacher
DL1 heaters.  The company has been using them to heat the sleepers of their 
trucks for about 4 years.  They are obviously much more suited since they
burn diesel in the first place.  However, I was interested in them because
of the lower risk of fire.  They also run for an incredibly long time on very
little fuel (about 20 hrs/gall.) and only pull about 3 amps.  

My idea was to mount a small tank in the space to the left of the engine.  Run
the fuel line under the bus.  Then, I was going to place the heater in a storage
box I built under the rear-facing bench seat (I have a Westy).  I could
then either pipe the heat directly into the bus or pipe it throught the floor
into the heater tube running under the bus thus increasing the defrost as well.
The only problem is that this would require three holes through the floor 
(intake, exhaust, and fuel).

As far as other uses (Beetle etc) --
From what I've seen they're are the same size or smaller than the BN-4 so the
only extra space would be the tank for diesel which wouldn't need to be big.

Can anyone think of any problems with this?  Does it sound like it would work?

Anyone Interested
- ------------------
Also,  I might be able to get several extra if anyone would like to try this
out themselves.  And Yes, they are NEW.  The company has abandoned them for
newer models.  They're new in the box and contain all the necessary wiring,
hoses, fuel pump, thermostat, and install instructions.  

I would like to hear what everyone thinks.
