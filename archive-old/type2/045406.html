Subject: RE: [T2] dipstick, poptop questions

Hey, the way he worded that doesn't make sense.
It should be the first two are from the stop , the Add Mark is 1/2&quot; past the
Full Mark.
What I was doing is cutting a 914 dipstick to fit in a bus motor.  I had to
hack off about 6 inches and then made my new marks.
Sorry for the confusion


Thanks!

&gt;
&gt; &gt; All measurements from the bottom edge of the stop.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Overall length :  11 5/16&quot;
&gt; &gt; To full mark : 8 15/16&quot;
&gt; &gt; To add mark : 1/2&quot;
&gt;
&gt; Mike,
&gt; I don't get the 'To add mark' measurement.  Half an inch?
&gt; Thanks!
