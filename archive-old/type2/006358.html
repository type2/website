X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL



Is it true that a `67 westy with anything bigger than a stock 1500 needs
scoops to provide adequate cooling?

    NO!

I'd like to go with 1600 SP or DP but I don't like the idea of placing
scoops on the side of an other wise
good looking vehicle.

    The woods are crawling with splitties powered by 1600 SP or DP engines,
running and cooling just fine
    without added scoops.

Are there other options? I'd like to cruise at 60-65 mph.

    Cruising speed will be limited by your drive train's gearing and the rev
limits of your engine.  See the
    archives for extensive discussion of these considerations.

Thanks.
