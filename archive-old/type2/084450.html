Subject: RE: 69 Paint Color

Hi,

My bus is also a 69, but made in September 68 according to the M-plate
and it also was lotus white originally (it has been red for as long as I 
remember)

Rogelio

&gt;hello everyone,
&gt;            I have a 1969 bus. From what the vin code says, is that it was=
&gt;  made on Jan. 7,  1969. My color code is 4242 which is lotus white, on lo=
&gt;tus white. I checked the library, and archive, and it seems there are som=
&gt;e differences in opinion. What I see in one, is that lotus white was only=
&gt;  used until 68. Another says, it was used until 71. Does anyone know for =
&gt;sure?  I was wondering if my Bus could be a late 68, or still have some 6=
&gt;8 options on it (ie: paint color) being that it was made so early in 69. =
&gt;Any info would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.
