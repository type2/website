This is my daily driver, commuter, and camping vehicle.  It is not a show
vehicle, so originality is not a significant factor to me. Reliability and
longevity are. The FI I use is original stock VW equipment, and VWs solution to
what they must have considered a deficiency in carburetors.

&gt;  Every step away from stock is an experiment, and too
&gt; many times done by someone not qualified. Since these people rarely if ever
&gt; write down their data, all they have to offer is seat of the pants
&gt; testamonials and claims justifying their wizdom in parts mixing and
&gt; time/money spending.

Grab some cheese and crackers to go along with the following whine. ;&gt;)

I know I am new to this list, and have offered views and explanations that may
conflict with some of the more established listers.  I have certainly felt the
heat from some who are not open minded to ideas that may challenge their own.  I
have also received many deriding remarks.  Many of these remarks assume I have no
experience, formal training, qualification, or success in automotive technology.
Or, some allude that I am an unintelligent, ham fisted, impulsive grease monkey,
throwing my disposable income into a hobby.  I've never been to the point where I
have felt I had disposable income.  I make my decisions in an unfamiliar area
through careful and complete research, interrogation of professionals, thirty-six
years of experience, and deliberate consideration of all of the opposing views to
see if they hold up to the logic test.

If this list was set up to present a variety of view points and further
discussions so that others may gather the information and find what works for
them, then good.

I have no ego here.  I lost my ego a long time ago.  I reference a large source
of information before I make a post, as I think the important part of this list
is to get  the correct information out to the masses.  I usually check several
published technical works (not enthusiast's magazines) before I challenge a
statement presented as fact by some of the legacy listers.

I accept at face value your experiences.  Without meeting me or knowing me you
feel you must reject mine.  The tone of your's and a minority of others, hinders
the free flow of ideas.  Others may not have the willingness to open themselves
up to ridicule, if they present an argument not supported by &quot;conventional
wisdom&quot;, or &quot;guru's,&quot; even if that argument is supported by fact.

Love,

Mike D.
