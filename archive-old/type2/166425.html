Subject: Re: [T2] Possible areas of oil leak?

Jeremiah - Sounds good. Now before you get much more
mileage on it, re-torque the head nuts. You'll be
amazed how much some of them have loosened and others
have not. That is, unless you did that originally. I
found that if you torque everything down in three
steps, the third step being the recommended torque
setting, then leave it overnight or even a full day
and re-torque, you'll find they've changed a lot! 

The T4 pushrod seals should not have any sealer put on
them. I used high temp wheel bearing grease to install
them with. I also used PowerPunch grease successfully
which means that the grease simply lubricated the
installation - and maybe helped a little for them to
be able to flex and move, but very little to aid
sealing. If you just let the O-rings do their thing,
they work very well (as long as the surfaces are clean
and smooth.)

My worst oil leaks were oil pressure idiot light
senders. When I switched to a remote sender for the
gauge and light, connected via flexible hose, my oil
leak problems went away. Sure there were the
occasional sucked valve cover gasket and the vitron
o-rings eventually do get hard and leak... oh - and
the damned dipstick tube bellows. But those are
maintenance items and once fixed, it only takes
20-30,000 miles to bake off the oil that sprayed
everywhere! -BaH

&gt; my engine leaked a little till i put in all new

&gt; yet i have had no
&gt; leaks but i have less than 500 miles on the top end
&gt; rebuild.  honed
&gt; and debermed the pistons, all new lifters, new
&gt; remanned heads, i think
&gt; that's a top end rebuild, though three years into
