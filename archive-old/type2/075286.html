Subject: Re: Westfalia pronunciation

&gt;What BTW is the correct pronunciation?  I usually hear
&gt;west FAYL ya but have also heard west FALL ya. 

Germans would probably pronounce it &quot;vest-FAH-leea&quot; or &quot;vest-FAH-lya&quot;.  IIRC, the German vowel names/sounds are &quot;ah&quot;, &quot;ay&quot;, &quot;ee&quot;, &quot;oh&quot;, &quot;oo&quot;.  One of the 
things I always liked about German back when I was learning it in HS was its isographic (?) nature -- a far more rigid relation between the letter and its sound than in 
English.  Usually no doubt about the pronunciation of a word when you see it in print.*

Within the U.S., few people will flinch if you call it a Volks-wagun West-fail-ya, even though most Germans would say &quot;Folksvahgen Vestfahlia&quot;.

&lt;sigh&gt; Every now and then I get a yearning for worldwide implementation of the International Phonetic Alphabet....

*Conversely, English borrows so readily from other languages that it's hard to learn, partly because spelling and pronunciation are often at best casually related.  
G.B. Shaw's famous example is that you could spell &quot;fish&quot; GHOTI, from the gh in laugh, the o in women, and the ti in motion.
