&lt;&lt; You'd need to use something inexpensive (tractor paint?) if you wanted to
paint your Bus with a brush. &gt;&gt;

...Saw a 1936 Bentley at a local 4th of July parade/display. The finish was 
done with a brush (the owner was a purist)...It was BRG (British Racing
Green), and the owner said it was a &quot;wings off&quot; (fenders removed) paint
job that took about 3 months between the painting, sanding, and final buff-
ing. Looked spectacular...Really deep color and shine, without that 
&quot;plasticky&quot;
look that modern clear coated cars seem to have. 8-)
I asked about the paint, and the owner claimed it had been mixed up for him
by an English Co. per the original Bentley formula...$250 per gal. plus ship-
ping (Ouch!) I suspect the guy probably grinds his own carnuba wax, too.
