&gt;I would like a list of suggestions/recommendations of things that I should
&gt;service...belts and such.  Is there a specific order I should follow?  I
&gt;have until May to get the vehicle ready, so being thorough is already on the
&gt;brain.


Need to do list for VW bus to make road safe and trouble free (as possible):

1.   Buy a Haynes or Bentley Transporter Manual 73-79.

Engine bay area:
1.   Steam clean engine bay.
2.   Drain and clean fuel tank.
3.   Check fuel tank filler neck rubber elbows and small rubber hoses (they
are on each side of engine bay and behind the gas tank cover).
4.   Check and replace if needed, heater cables.
5.   New battery. (check cables, replace if necessary)
6.   Replace all fuel lines (I have seen too many busses burn up from lack
of new hoses)

Engine &amp; Transmission:
1.   Check compression, if low, or readings are over 30% different, do a
valve job.
2.   If you remove the heads, check wear in cylinders, replace if necessary.
3.   Replace front main oil seal.  VERY IMPORTANT!!
4.   Rebuild alternator?  Replace alternator drive belt.
5.   Make sure thermostat is working correctly
6.   Check heater boxes and exhaust system, replace parts as needed.
7.   Make sure all engine tin is replaced and secured.
8.   Check starter, replace or rebuild if needed.
9.   Replace clutch, pressure plate and throwout bearing.
10. Check all engine and transmission mounts, replace as needed.
11. Check transmission linkage and replace as needed (shaft coupler wear
makes for sloppy shifting)
12. Replace engine seal all the way around. (VERY IMPORTANT!!!)
13. Change oil in both engine and transmission.

Rear Suspension:  (you need to purchase a CV bolt driver tool)
1.   Grease CV's.
2.   Replace CV boots (do not use cheap boots, they will last maybe 10,000
miles)
3.   Grease rear wheel bearings.
4.   Check shock absorbers, replace if necessary.

Brakes:
1.   Replace rear wheel shoes and wheel cylinders, turn drums if necessary.
2.   Check rubber flex hoses all the way around.
3.   Check emergency brake cable to see if it moves freely.
4.   Replace front brake pads, turn rotors if necessary.
5.   Replace master cylinder.
6.   Grease front wheel bearings.

Front Suspension: (you will need to remove the gravel shield)
1.   Check ball joints for wear (with weight off of front wheels)
2.   Grease front beam (upper and lower)
3.   Check and replace if necessary tie rod ends.
4.   Fill steering box.
5.   Oil all moving parts and check for wear. (clutch pedal linkage, brake,
accelerator, shifter, etc.)
6.   Check shock absorbers, replace if necessary.
7.   Check tires all around, replace if needed, balance.
