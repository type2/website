Subject: Re: [T2] Wanted: Bus Towbar

Flat towing an automatic anything without the axles, driveshaft removed,
will guarantee, a fried pump in the trans.

Now the only way I know to get around this phenomina, is to leave the
engine running with the vehicle in neutral, so the pump is pumping as
you tow---but the chances of the vehicle dropping in gear while your
pulling it this way are pretty good, so I would forget about that
idea----

Safest way to pull anything is to pull the axles,or drive shaft----

Later,

Terry
