I do not know if 1/4in is close enough to 5mm to work correctly or
&gt;not, but the price was right.

That price was WRONG.  It will eat your bus someday.  I used it, with
tightly clamped SS band clamps, and it still wiggled loose.  Don't do it.
Get the right stuff.  It's seductively close, but it DOES NOT FIT CORRECTLY.

Sorry to preach, but the right stuff is out there.  Tell 'em, Ron.
