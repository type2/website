Subject: 73 sunroof bus has gotta go

hey all...
i've got a 73 sunroof bus that needs to go, it's costing me $50/month to 
store.  it doesn't run, don't know why.  carb is junk, but that's not the 
reason, it's something electrical.  i never had a chance to check out too 
much on it because at the time the t4 engine scared the hell out of me.  the 
body is in decent condition.  sliding door falls off, but will stay on if 
closed or open more than half way.  trans. is good, engine turns easily by 
hand, and leaks NO oil.  it's been sitting in my storage space for about 5 
months now and not a drop on the floor.  missing front seats, front int. 
door panels, and rear bumper.  front tires are shot, rear ones are o.k.  
sunroof needs attention, as it does not open, but i'm sure all parts are 
still there, from what i could see.  bus is not in too bad of shape overall, 
just needs some lovin' and it could be put back on the road easily.  i have 
pics if anyone is interested.  asking price: $300 obo.  any serious offer 
will not be refused.  it's either this or the junkyard.  am willing to trade 
if you've got something i need (1600sp bus motor?, etc.).  i'm hoping 
someone will take it and give it a good home, as i know that the junkyard of 
choice around here doesn't take good care of vehicles.  bus is located in 
Lake Mills, WI.  about 30 minutes east of madison and and hour west of 
milwaukee.
