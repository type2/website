Subject: [T2] Jack points

What can be done or not done to repair jack points on a 73.   I was using
mine last night to work on the rear brakes and the point gave way.  Lucky
for me it fell slow and got hung up on the wheel.  So one was hurt but the
hole for the jack is much bigger and won't hold the bus any more.
