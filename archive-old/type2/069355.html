&gt;There's this $8 tool called a flywheel lock.

&gt;Another thing you'll have to do is support the engine so it doesn't tip over
&gt;when you loosen the gland nut.

I endorse the Muir Thing. It's about the same $8 for a piece of channel bar
from the local hardware store but

(1) You distribute the force over two studs instead of one, which might
prevent a bent stud if some fool put the gland nut on with an air hammer,
and

(2) You don't have to worry about holding the engine with some kind of
jury-rigged clamp (or in Joe's case a dangerous and odiferous primate). You
just stand on the bar.
