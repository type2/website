Subject: [T2] Manassas trip report

Hi-ya!
I got to go to my first bus show this past weekend, a little dreary but
still mamaged to get sun burn.
I went down with Eric Eisenburg  owner of Very Wild Car Company 
(in Newark Delaware) My bus didn't go for the trip cuz I need an exhust
plus how could I pass the chance to ride in the &quot;death trap&quot; single cab
with Eric. He had  a bunch of For Sale stuff piled high in the bed of
the single cab and pulling a trailer packed with stuff too, amazing the
weight we were pulling. Every time we went over a bridge I thought we'd
lose it.  So going along the oil light flickers and we pull over to find
the oil filler neck loosened itself and shot all the oil out. We hung
around a bit and fixed it to get back on the groove-well it happened a
second time about an hour later only this time accompanying the oil
light was a *nice*sound of swirling marbles comming from the back. 
I now know what it sounds like to hear a rod go. not a good thing, so
AAA to the rescue, we were 30 min from Manassas 3 hours from home. AAA
coverd the bus but not the trailer. Eric paid 100 bucks for the trailer
to be towed. his Pop who was following behind along with friend Nick,
decided to go with the single cab back home while we went on to the
show. It was great, I had no idea it would be like a flea market for VWS
along with the bass pumping mack daddy cars and race cars-I had no I dea
they went that fast and the sloglum(sp?) races those were the best true
driving and racing those guys really worked at getting around that
track. Oh there was a 72 super bettle going round theat threw a rod, I
kind got that engine sound down now... but no busses in the sloglom I
guess we're too cool for all that fast lane stuff. In the used parts lot
I found a german made side tent from none other than our friend Bob--
(accessys_at_smart_dot_net) he gave me a great deal only after I told him I was
part of the List (;  pretty cool guy, and I met Steve Dolan really great
happy character, It was just so great to meet people you've talked to
and get the chance to say those things that are hard to say over the
list and get to match a face with the faceless world we live in thru the
list.  I also met a man from Salem, VA who's a potter and a VW mech, I
bought a few pots. Eric teased me Only I could go to a VW show and come
home with pottery(i am a potter too). while we were walking around Eric
got a call saying his trailer was lost going down rt.66 not tooo much
was damaged luckily mainly the trailer,Eric said yesterday he's glad he
over built it. We were all pretty bummed but still managed to laugh and
enjoy the show. Just a little plug for Eric, he's got a lot of stuff
contact him if your looking for anything( I heard him say he's got a
child cot I forget for which year busbut it seem every one is looking)
he kind lost alot this weekend in this trip, buy his stuff (;
eric eisenberg &lt;verywild_at_bellatlantic_dot_net&gt; or (302)- 738-VWVW
he's got  alot of bug stuff too.
Hopefully I will be able to make it to Octoberbus. cuz  it's running
great    see ya there....
