Subject: Rust

I know that a very broad subject. allow me to narrow it down a bit.  

 

I have a '79 Westy and I just noticed rust forming at the rear base of the
rear driver's side vent window - in other words, the metal vertical
&quot;bar&quot;/&quot;frame member&quot; that is between for the rear driver's side vent window
and the fixed side window.

 

Question 1 - Is that vertical metal bar between the vent window and the
fixed window part of the vent frame? The body? A separate piece of metal?

Question 2 - Is it available anywhere?  Does someone have a good one they'd
part with?

Question 3 - Are the rubber gaskets available for the vent window?  For the
fixed window?  Where?

Question 5 - What is the recommended disassembly and reassembly
order/procedure?

 

TIA,

 

Wayne
