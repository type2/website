Subject: re: horsehair above oilbath

	I'd also be grateful to learn why my aircleaner  37 028 58 
261 has on the top near the outlet to the carb a couple vertical 
nozzles  -  one plastic, one brass  -  connecting into a common black 
rubber short pipe sticking down inside the roof.  I can suck or blow 
thru each little nozzle  -  and they're not connected to anything 
outside the air-cleaner.
	Is this some remnant of a PCV rig?  (We have no emissions 
regs in NZ, so people commonly disconnect any such obstruction.)
