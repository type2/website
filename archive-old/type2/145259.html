Subject: Re: [T2] bus accident

I have a friend who has a 'Buy Here, Pay Here' car  lot.  I always ask him about bodyshops, mechanics, etc. because he  buys cars cheap at an auction that need work.  He fixes them up  then sells them on time at  a huge mark-up.  I had the same  trouble with getting my bus fixed and he recommended several shops, all  of whom were willing to do it and cheaper than any of the 'insurance  check' shops.  So stop in and ask some of them who they'd  use.  Now if I can just find the money...     Cheers...KR

When  I was looking around for a shop to do the bodywork on my bus  (traditional bus rust issues) I had a really difficult time finding  one. They would look at it and then decided they wouldn't be able to  find the parts for it. I would promise to provide all the sheet metal  but they still refused.

One shop told me they didn't work on VW  vans and after I left the office, I went around back and saw an  aircooled Vanagon up on the lift.

I came to the conclusion that  most of these shops were only interested in insurance claims. My advice  would be to wait until the adjusters give you a large figure before you  go to any more shops.
