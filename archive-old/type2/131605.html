Subject: RE: [T2] Loss of compression in newer 1600 Mexi

&gt;From: JWAzevedo_at_aol_dot_com

&gt;each tune-up I generally check the compression.  I've been getting about 
&gt;110 (+/- 2).  But this last time, the compression in #3 was 85.  Also, the 
&gt;spark plug in that cylinder was grayish-white, whereas the others were 
&gt;brownish-black.

&gt;Any thoughts?

What is your normal cycle? Compression Test first then valve adjustment or 
the other way around? How did you do it this time?
