thought so too, but ran a multi fill several hundred mile check, more than
one gas station is selling me air bubbles or there is another problem.

will have to check the temp sensor, haven't checked the cyl presure but it
is a recently rebuilt engine so it &quot;sure hope it's not my new P&amp;C&amp;
