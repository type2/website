Subject: 72' rotor not turning

hey all, 
       i have a 72' 1700, and when i turn the crank the rotor doesn't move. 
i've tried pushing down and turning. when i remove the dizzy i can see it 
turning. this is not a new dizzy, it's the one i've been using for 2 years 
and i've never had this problem. 
     also,  i don't have a scale on my shroud (or marks for that matter).  is 
TDC generally at the top of the case ( that split or weld mark or whatever)?  
      
         TIA 
            N8
