Subject: '73 Westy back on the road in SLC

Haven't had much time to visit, but I thought I'd drop a line to say I
got the engine off the sawhorses and back in the '73 Bus (WHOOPEE!).
It's running, emissioned, safety'd, &amp; registered (1st time since '91...
3 owners later!). Still need to figger out these new-fangled dual solex
thingies... runs good but has a bad transition from idle to running.
Also, gas mileage seems low, but odometer is dead so I won't know how
I'm doing until I swap the speedo from the parts '73.

BTW: for all who asked for '73 parts... I haven't forgotten about any of
you... just delayed by finishing the engine and a mess o' birthdays!

Ended up getting anal on the engine installation... scoured the engine
compartment. Noticed the tail light assy had been mangled by the
battery... luckily I had put 2 new assys in the parts '73, so swapped
one. One marker light had been siliconed on and was halfway off. Popped
out the crappy little plastic anchors that VW used and replaced them
w/6mm bolts (10mm head)... perfect fit. 

It's a little more gutless than it used to be, which I expected because
I went from about 9:1 compression down to 7.3:1 and got rid of the Weber
&quot;gas-hog&quot; progressive. I'm hoping dialing in the carbs will get a little
more power out of it, but I'm also not used to the weight of the '73
(feels heavy after driving the '67 Bug for a year). Oh, and the pushrod
tube leaks are fixed... bone dry! ...but I do have a _small_ drip up
front :(

So it's running... took it in for a good bath. Vacuumed the cat hair off
the bench/bed. Yanked the beat-to-sh*t wardrobe out and replaced it with
a _really_ nice one I snagged last summer. Cleaned where the cabinet
goes while it was out... lookin' good!

Now it needs a stereo and a trailer hitch. Probably fabricate the hitch,
unless a better offer comes along. Need to drill holes for the stock
retracting seat belts from the other '73... the non-retracters SUCK!
Also, thanks to the parcel tray thread, I'll install the passenger side
tray that I came across a couple years ago. I couldn't figure out how it
installed, but I'll check again now that I read you have to drill a
couple holes and seen the nice pics (Thanks, Jeff!).

Drove out to the Great Salt Lake with my 7 yr old son and sailed for
about 4 hours last Sunday, then drove it to the Bluegrass jam last
night... needed a break after all the hours I've spent trying to finish
this thing up.

Well, I hear some folks snoring in the back, and I've probably burned
off enough ASCII, so I'll let you go. Thanks for the advice on the
engine snags... could have done it without ya, but the results would
have sucked!
