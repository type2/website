&gt; My girlfriend had an early Subaru with wet sleeves that had an incurable
&gt; seal problem that let coolent into the oil. 

Hello George   This is a common problem even on new Subarus   What they are 
doing to help it is an additive cooling system conditioner ( I can hear old 
herr dr Tim now  Snakeoil !! )  but this stuff really works. I have been using it 
on Vw waserboxers when they start to loose coolant by the head o rings  works 
real well there also.  Stuff is made in England by Holts only $1.20 a bottle 
. I saw a bunch of the Subaru techs using it they called it a head gasket in a 
bottle   .  Later and have fun  Mark Dearing  Salem Import Service  Salem Va
