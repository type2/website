Subject: Timing

Steve- I am sure I read your question wrong but...if I am not mistaken- 
as you rotate the crankshaft pulley clockwise to 7.5 the timing light 
should go on.  That means good to go.  I have always static timed my 
bugs and busses (66 bug, 67 bug, 67 convert, 73 bug, 69 bus and 70 
westy) and have no had any problems in the 12 years I have done this.  I 
know I will get alot of crap for this but I have always followed Muir 
with no problems.  Now if my memory is still ok...if you rotate the 
distributor clockwise you advance and counterclockwise you retard.
