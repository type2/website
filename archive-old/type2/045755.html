Subject: Re: [T2] filler neck?

&gt;I believe Wolfsburg West carries these.
&gt;

&gt;
&gt; FILLER NECK HOSE, Bus, 1974-1979, for non California cars.
&gt;                           Price:
&gt;                                       $16.50

For '74&gt;'79 single and double cabs the partnumber is 261 201 119 
and not available from VW anymore, the last one I got was half the price 
listed above (5 years ago). In a pick up this part is even more critical 
as the filler neck is significantly shorter.
