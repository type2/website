Subject: Looking for a '71 Drivers Side Grease Cap

Hi,

Been loving and driving my '71 bus a lot lately. During a recent trip
down to West Virginia my speedo went out. I incorrectly assumed a
cable problem, I was wrong. Turns out the square cutout on my drivers
side grease cap has become rounded out and it's no longer allowing for
the square end of the speedo cable to turn.

Problem is, I can't find a replacement grease cap anywhere. Bus depot
stocks the 64-70 grease cap and they've informed me that the the '71
cap is NLA.

Can anyone help me locate the driver's side grease cap with the speedo
cutout for a '71 bus?

I'd really like to get the odometer functioning again so I don't end
up changing my oil and adjusting my valves too often. :)

thanks!
peace
