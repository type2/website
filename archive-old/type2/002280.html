Hey Folks,

I'm looking to purchase a VW Bus Tow Bar.

I've heard about several home made ideas and wanted to know if anyone knows
where I can buy one made to pull a 1974 VW without having to be heavily
modified and that doesn't take up the entire bed of a full size pick-up.

From what I hear, the universal tow bar mounted to the bumper of a van will
not work.

Another option, I'm thinking of having supports welded from the frame to up
in front of the bumper.  Then, attach a universal tow bar to the supports.
Any thoughts on this?

Thanks for your continued help &amp; support.

Sincerely,

Darrin K. Pierce
'74 Westy
