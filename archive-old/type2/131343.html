Subject: Re: [T2] Dipstick Thermometer at WalMart?

Well, oil maintains it's temperature for a pretty long time. If you're 
getting funky symptoms or just want to know what the oil is like after a 
long drive, you can head back and drop this thing in for a minute.

I know it's just a snapshot, and can't provide any trending information, but 
it also forces us all to check our oil more frequently than we probably 
would otherwise... ;-)

My bus is loaded with &quot;hippie wiring&quot; (lots of mickey-mouse jobs, shorts, 
etc) and adding more wiring is not appealing to me. But I'm still curious 
how my temps are... This is a cheap and easy way to get one of the temps...

What's the benefit of dropping in a oil temp gauge that you can't keep
an eye on when your driving the vehicle?
