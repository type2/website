Subject: RE: [T2] Re: Short range FM transmitters

These sound like the ideal thing to have at a bus event. Let people listen to
what you want to broadcast if they want to in their own bus. Might be a useful
tool. I was looking at the same kit yesterday, but was wondering what the
difference would be if you got an AM one? I figured that the AM stations might
have less chance of trampling on someone else's signal. Is their any real
difference in the sound quality between AM and FM when used in such a small
area?
