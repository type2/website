Subject: Re: Fan Broken,Broken down

Vince- If the fan has disintegrated, the remnants may be lying on top of your
cylinders and heads. Remember the bunch of dust/rust that come in through the
heater? I'd vote for dropping the engine, removing the shroud and cleaning
things up under it. Good chance to degrease the block, heads and oil cooler.
Sorry, if not for the fan issue it would be different, although getting the
generator and fan out with the engine still in the bus is a bear of a job.
Tom




 I am trying to remove the generator and I can see that the Fan has about 1/3
of the fins missing. Something must have caused the fan to come apart.any
suggestions on how to lift the generator fan assembly out of the tight
compartment or do I have to drop the engine.
Any suggestions will be appreciated.
