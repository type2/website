&gt; &gt; The only useful thing I remember from perusing Muir is &quot;Timing is when
&gt; &gt; the match is lit; dwell is how long it it lit&quot;...ie, 50 degrees means 50
&gt; &gt; degrees of crank rotation.  Can you really controll the duration of the
&gt; &gt; high voltage current by how long the points are closed?  Could't you
&gt; &gt; then stick a voltmeter(continuity)  or static light across the points
&gt; &gt; and determing 50 degrees by how far the rotor moves before opening the
&gt; &gt; curcuit (distr. out of the bus)?  If the dist. is in the bus, it's the
&gt; &gt; crank you could mark for 50 degrees, but then the dwell meter is
&gt; &gt; easier.  MB

&gt; Michael,

&gt; First, on controlling the voltage, the amount of time the points are open
&gt; determines how long electricity feeds to the coil and condensor to
&gt; &quot;charge&quot; them.

The coil is &quot;charged&quot; while the points are closed.  Current flows through
the coil to the points and ground, building up a magnetic field in the
coil.  When the points open, the magnetic field disappears.  The changing
magnetic field induces a voltage in the secondary winding of the coil, and
the large number of windings in the secondary creates a very high voltage.

&gt; Like all systems involving a condensor/ capacitor, if you
&gt; hook it to DC, it charges and then sits.  You have to discharge it and
&gt; reload it to get current flow.  The rating of the condensor/capacitor
&gt; determines how much it can store.  As I understand it, when the points are
&gt; open, the electrons flow into the condensor, which stores them until the
&gt; points close.

The purpose of the condenser is to save the points from erosion due to
high current switching.  When the points open, there is a fairly large
current flowing through them from the coil.  The condenser is a capacitor
that provides an inital low resistance to this current, preventing major
arcing of the points.  If the condenser goes bad in an &quot;open&quot; state, you
will go through points at a fearsome rate.  The condenser does not provide
energy to the coil, however.

There is such a thing as a &quot;capacitive discharge&quot; ignition wherein the
energy from capacitors is directed to the coil, but this is a different
setup.
