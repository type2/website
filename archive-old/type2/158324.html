Subject: RE: [T2]76 Brakes (update) HeLP~!~

bruce i have been thinking same thing cause thats pretty much the only thing that has not been replaced or worked on......
  i must have missed the email somehow since i dont always get all my type2 emails for some reason..?
   
  i have looked at this regulator several times now and wondered hmmmm&gt;?? i wonder... could that be the issue..?  maybe it went bad or like you are saying needs servicing....
   
  any more tips on this would surely be appreciated....
   
  thanks
  chai

  Hi,

My bus is an earlier model than yours ('71), but there's a regulator between
the master cylinder and the rear wheels (it's located under the bus not far
behind the master cylinder). I seem to remember reading somebody's account of
servicing it and it was very &quot;gummed up&quot;. Perhaps that is your
problem...dunno...

Bruce.


                                                                Better start thinking about sealing up those windows and leaky doors....
  Winter months are on there way,dont forget to break out the heater and Lets Go CamPing~!
