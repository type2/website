Subject: Re: [T2] Headlights

In short the VW bus is electrically served by one wire running the battery 
to the fuse panel.

With age and the addition of modern stereos and such it is undersize for 
the job. I noticed my headlights were a bit yellow and that my stereo 
display sort of pulsated with the beat of the music.

So with the addition of new wires for the heavy power consumers - lights, 
radio, accessory jacks - I can rest assured that everything is getting a 
full 12 volts.

That means more voltage to make brighter lights.

The H4 lights still pull the standard 55/65W like the sealed beams lights 
but are supposedly superior just because of how they focus their light. A 
step up from sealed beams. If I can get a higher voltage to the headlights 
because I have heavier wiring and relays then I get another step up and 
slightly brighter lights.

A wire has it's limits and I feel my Westy's main wire was at it's limit (a 
guess). I should have measured it to prove it. Now I have extra capacity to 
add more lighting like the Hella 500 lights I have installed now.

The advantage of this modification is that it takes the whole headlight 
load off of the headlight switch - now it is only running the taillights 
and the dash lights and the new relays (which pull almost nothing). Should 
make the headlight switch last a bit longer (but how would you know?) 
Another is that the operation of the lights is exactly the same. No added 
switches or procedures.

Take a good multi-meter. Measure the voltage at the battery while the 
engine is running. Then take a headlight out and measure for voltage behind 
the headlight (you don't even have to unplug the bulb). One wire is the 
ground (brown), one wire is the highbeam (white) and one wire is low beam 
(yellow). The passenger bulb has black stripes on the wiring but the yellow 
and white main colors hold. Is there a difference? Now turn on the wipers 
and stereo (pretty loud just like when you travel down the highway). My 
expectation is that you'll see a voltage drop. Maybe something like a 1 
volt difference between what is delivered to the headlight and what was at 
the battery.

Relays aren't a requirement but may help improve your lighting. I'll report 
back next week once I have the system done completely done. I'm 1 wire from 
being done. The Vanagon list swears by this modification. The best thing is 
that it requires no wire cutting or holes drilled (except screws to mount 
the fuse panel).

&gt;Now, I'm curious why you needed a new fuse box, relays, et cetera, to 
&gt;upgrade your headlights... will the stock system not handle a pair of H4s? 
&gt;I've been curious about upgrading mine, but it's always been on the &quot;to do 
&gt;later&quot; list...
&gt;
&gt;&gt;I've about finished the headlight relay upgrade. By the way the Radio Shack
&gt;&gt;$5.99 30-amp relays are the very same ones as the relay I've gotten in both
&gt;&gt;my Hella 500 kits.
