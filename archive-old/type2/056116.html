I am currently rebuilding my 1971 stock engine up to 1776 for my camper.
Engine removal was a success and I am half way through the disassembly of the
long block.  I have many options but am unsure as to what to do exactly.  I
have never cracked a case but have done a top end rebuild with someone who
knew something about the inner workings of a motor.  I think that I could do
the top end with no problem but am unsure about the case.  I have talked to
AVP in Sacramento about different options and was quoted a price on a short
block that would basicly cost me $40.00 more for them to put it together.
This seems like a good deal to me if they are any good.  They seem to be
really helpful on the phone and were asking me all kinds of questions which I
took as a good sign.  They seem to care what they are going to sell me and
what I want it to do.  Has anyone had any dealings with them?  

Watch out for cats
