Subject: FI Vacuum leaks and CHT

Trying to track down vacuum leaks. My auxiliary air regulator rubber elbow
had a tear from the regulator end to the 90 degree bend. Someone in the
archives mentioned using an elbow from the HELP! brand found in most
FLAPS. The item number is 47028. The rubber is thicker. The metal tube
fits tight, but the aux air regulator end was a little loose so I put a
clamp on it. Seems to work great. I'll use it until I order the proper
part.

Also, I removed the oil breather hose to replace the temp II sender (yes,
mine is on the #2 cylinder instead of #3...looks like I have a left side
head on the right side *sigh*). The hose looked in good condition.
However, when I put my hand around it to ease it loose, I discovered a 1
inch slit on the bottom side! I wrapped it good with electrical tape. So
between that and the temp II sender replacement (which is a whole story in
itself), my cold and warmup idle problems went away.  I also think (know)
that I was running too lean. On a day in the low 90's, at 70mph, my head
temps according to my Dakota CHT gauge, were between 450F and 475F. My oil
temp stabilized at 255F. I'm waiting to do a highway run again and see how
my temps read. I'll post my results later.

Check ALL of your vacuum hoses as in remove them and inspect them.  I
haven't done all mine yet, but I will remove them and blow through them
with the other end plugged to see if there is a leak. I just bought a
vacuum gauge too.
