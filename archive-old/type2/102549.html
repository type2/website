Subject: Re: [T2] Leaky Valve Covers

&gt;I think I may need new gaskets, but it's only been about a year since 
&gt;these were brand-new.  Is this the typical service life of gaskets, or 
&gt;should they last longer?

My 914-4 sucks valve cover gaskets almost everytime I autocross it.  The
gaskets deform and suck in along the bottom edge and oil poors out (I've
never glued my gaskets).  I have the same problem on my bus, but not nearly
as often.  One possible cause of sucking gaskets is insufficient crankcase
ventilation.

I always thought VW's design on the type IV motor valve covers was pretty
half-assed.  If they'd put TWO tabs on each side instead of the one in the
middle it would have taken care of the problem once and for all.
