Yes.  Something is very wrong.

  Look underneath for problems with the steering gear, and look at the
rubber disc (coupler)  at the base of the steering column; it's under a
cover that you get to from the inside. I wouldn't drive it until you figure
out what's going on!

I don't know alot about this area, but I thought I should warn you ASAP;
maybe someone else from the list can advise you at what to look at in
particular.  (TIA, listmembers)

Subject: [T2] steering wheel alignment


&gt; Hey Everyone, I have what may be a silly question but
&gt; better safe than sorry.  Before yesterday my steering
&gt; wheel (when i was driving and going straight)has a bar
&gt; across it that was in the mostly horizontal position.
&gt; Now, today when getting in it is was more at a 45
&gt; degree angle.  I'm under the impression that this is
&gt; not normal.  The only thing that happened between the
&gt; last time I drove her and today was that my roommate
&gt; moved it out of the driveway so she could get her car
&gt; out.  She didn't notice anything funny happening and
&gt; didn't notice what position the steering wheel was in.
&gt;
&gt; Is this a problem?  what should I check out?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
&gt; Chrissie and Gertie ('78 Transporter)
