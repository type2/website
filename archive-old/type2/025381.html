On the floor of my '73 bus there is an oval hole. Attached to this hole is
heater tubing that goes toward the front of the bus. Over this hole there is
a black flap which is hinged at one end and held down with a rather weak
spring. When I got my bus the PO had stuffed a sock in it and duct taped it
shut. I've pulled the sock out and removed the duct tape.

Can anyone tell me what this is?
