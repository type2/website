&gt; I can't figure out what all of the extra verbage is on the &quot;bug&quot; one

&gt; &quot;bug&quot; in their trademark are in violation.

A trademark is &quot;generally distinctive symbols, pictures, or words that
sellers affix to distinguish and identify the origin of their
products&quot;. The blurry area here gets into the idea that most people
wouldn't mistake something completely unrelated to automobiles w/ VW
if the word &quot;bug&quot; was used. From what I understand these laws were
simply put in place to protect unscrupulous peoples from cashing in on
a recognized product. VWoA seems to be going well beyond what they
should be doing to protect their &quot;mostly&quot; good name. I have a tough
time understanding how something like &quot;bug&quot;, &quot;bus&quot; or even &quot;beetle&quot;
can be trademarked in this way. It is usually used simply as
identification.

I don't think (&amp; IANAL) that these words can fall under the &quot;common
word&quot; umbrella where it kinda means a lot of things, such as the term
Unix to identify many different branches of OS. Someone who mentions
&quot;bug&quot; or &quot;beetle&quot; will cause whoever is listening to identify that
converation w/ a small air-cooled rear engine vehicle build by VW. Not
get it confused w/ say a corvair, etc.  I'm guessing this is where the
lawyers are getting their leverage.

I'm going to guess that this thread has gone into it's tangents. I'll
kill my contributions to the thread now :) Just hated to not send it
since I spent the time writing it. 

&gt; I noticed after I figured out how to work the site, they even trademarked
&gt; &quot;Drivers Wanted&quot;.
&gt; The world is getting weird, dave

getting? man, it already is :)
