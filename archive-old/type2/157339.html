Subject: RE: [T2] Clutch Pedal Travel Question

The clutch cable has a mechanical shock absorber
(called a bowden tube) to account for engine torque
twisting the tranny relative to the frame. This would
also be able to absorb any extra pedal travel due to
not having a mat. If the clutch is adjusted correctly
it will be fully disengaged before you reach the 3/8&quot;
mat.

Those clutch cables just wear out, that's normal. you
may want to ensure that bowden tube has some bend in
it (it is near the clutch arm on the tranny, black
rubber tube) and make sure the clutch pedal is
adjusted properly. It should press in just slightly
with almost no resistance before pulling the cable
tight.

The manuals or the dummy book have the details on this
stuff.
