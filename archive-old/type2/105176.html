I love snake oil ads!  I saw this same device advertised a few months ago
as a water-softening device.  What it is is a couple of strong magnets
(neodymium, most likely) in a housing.  You can make your own a lot

When it is done, you will have a device that works just as well as the $90
unit, that is, not at all!
