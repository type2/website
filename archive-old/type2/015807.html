&gt;I have a 1978 camper bus.  I do not think it is a westy. it has a straight
&gt;pop up and a RV tag on the side from Oregon anyway the tag says the bus
&gt;weighs 2800 lbs rear and 2251 on the front for a total of 5051 lbs then
&gt;under that it says it can carry an additional 920 lbs.  

The weights you listed are gross axle weights.  The 920 lbs is not
additional, you have to subtract that to get the actual vehicle weight.

&gt;I know the weight is
&gt;correct because I was on a scale and with me in it it weighed 5260.  

I don't know what to say about that, but I think this topic is probably
ready to be killed by Steve anyway, so I will stop posting about it now.  :)
