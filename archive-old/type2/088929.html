Subject: Re: [T2] Need exhaust manifold advice

[...]

3 things can be bad [I have seen the ones I listed, there may be more]:

1) copper seal ring, either missing or burned out or half cocked in the hole.

2) flange on end of manifold, either warped and not sealing to the copper ring
or the tack welds broke and the iron flange is no longer swedged to the
stainless steel pipe.

3) the cylinder head has a chunk of aluminum missing where the copper seal
ring sits, usually where one of the studs enter the head.....

Remove the exhaust pipe and look at all these places. I would drop the U
pipe/exhaust header in one piece. 4 tin screws holds the lower tin, 4 nuts
hold the manifold to the head, and 3 nuts and bolts on the end of the U pipe
where it bolts to the box. I find it easier then trying to remove the manifold
at the U in the bus. Use plenty of penetrating oil, like Liquid Wrench, NOT
WD-40.

&gt; Please talk to me about diagnosing and fixing an exhaust manifold leak on
&gt; my rebuilt 76 two liter.
&gt;
&gt; I have about 30 miles on the newly overhauled original engine, and today
&gt; one of the cylinders has started blowing fire out around it's exhaust
&gt; manifold pipe, where the pipe enters the head.
&gt;
&gt; The exhaust header from the cylinder on the passenger rear is allowing
&gt; visible flames to come out at the place where the header mates with the
&gt; underside of the head. And it is LOUD.  I tried tightening the two nuts on
&gt; the studs at that cylinder, but it didn't help, and I was afraid to go any
&gt; tighter because I think there is aluminum alloy up in there somewhere.
&gt;
&gt; Do I have to replace that header, or can I take it off and devise/find/buy
&gt; a gasket of some kind that will seal up that space?  The other 3 cylinders
&gt; are tight at the headers, but this one is showing fire when I have the
&gt; bottom plate off and it is just sitting there idling.
&gt;
&gt; Or, is this possibly a problem in the head? Could this be a cracked head?
&gt; I'm hoping that talking this over with the type-2 list will get me moving
&gt; in some reasonable direction toward resolving this problem.
&gt;
&gt; My impression at this point is that I have to take off the header and
&gt; examine both the head and the header pipe, to try to determine why it isn't
&gt; sealing.   Any ideas there? This must have happened to at least a thousand
&gt; other people since the middle 70's.
