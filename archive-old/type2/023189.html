Subject: Importing a '73 to Canada
Mime-Version: 1.0
X-Diagnostic: Not on the accept list
X-Envelope-To: type2
X-From: t2-moderator_at_type2_dot_com

 
I would like to know what modifications I would 
have to make to my '73 ('74 model year) Single Cab 
If I would bring it to Canada (Montreal) and have 
it registered there.  It has H4 headlights, no side 
markers, US spec taillight lenses with SAE approval 
marks. No seatbelts, no window washers. It's a 1776 
with dual carbs, no emmision equipment whatsoever. 
No back up lights. The speedo and odometer are in 
Km, the car was originally delivered in the 
Netherlands. Would there be import duties and taxes, 
apart from administration/registration fees?

The Canadian goverment has quite some info on their 
sites, and it seems that importing a vehicle older 
than 15 years into Canada is not much of a problem, 
but that was about all the info I could find.

Any info would be greatly appreciated,

TIA 

Brian
