&gt; 2. WHat happens if the lead is extended beyond the prescribed length? Does the
&gt; reading go up or down? Will the guage still work in a linear fashion?

It shouldn't have an effect according to the 2nd Seebeck law:
 
&gt; In a circuit as shown consisting of two dissimilar metals with their junctions
&gt; at temperatures T1 and T2, a third metal is introduced by cutting and forming
&gt; two junctions as shown.

&gt; If the temperature of the third metal introduced is
&gt; uniform over its entire length, the total electromotive force will be
&gt; unaffected. As a consequence of this law any measuring device or lead wire can
&gt; be added to the circuit without affecting the accuracy as long as the new
&gt; junctions are at the same temperature. This law also permits soldering or
&gt; brazing of thermocouple junctions.
