&quot;Flashing&quot; ...... Sorry....................
Aluminum sheet metal stock, thick enough to offer support, but still thin
enough for the metal cutting snips. 
Don't use real heavy gauge metal, however, as you do want the support
material to assume a natural vibration response at a low frequency, as
opposed to the high frequency you will get with heavy gauge metal plate.

I used aluminum as I had some on hand from the making of old ham radio
enclosures, but I think you could use galvanized, as well.

Remember, however, that galvanized will often attack against aluminum, so
probably better to go looking for aluminum sheet metal stock; especially
given that it will be positioned right up against the foil backing of the
felt material.

The aluminum support plate will reflect the heat and the sound, although
there will be some resonances associated to the support sheeting. The
re-radiation of the vibrations seem to be pretty well killed from where I
sit up in the driver's seat, and from where Mary Beth does her couch
potato interstate thing :-) right above the engine, so I am supposing that
the felt goes on to really absorb the small vibrations that might be
re-radiated by the aluminum sheet stock.

This was very easy job to do, and yielded very good results.
It is fun to point out to others when you do the old &quot;look at my engine&quot;
thing, and it looks one heck of a lot more professional than black
cardboard.
