Subject: oil pressure

I have just run my bus for the first time and despite a carburetor problem 
and the inability to idle there is one thing which bothers me.  I am running 
an 1800 engine with 20w 50 castrol oil and the oil pressure at startup was 50 
psi.  Once the engine was up to temperature and 15 minutes into the run the 
oil slowly dropped down to 20 psi where it stabilized. The longer the engine 
ran, the lower the pressure steadily dropped.  This seems way low to me but I 
don't know what others have experienced with oil pressure.  By the way, the 
engine rpm was about 2500 rpm the whole time (necessary to &quot;work harden&quot; the 
new camshaft according to the cam manufacturer).
Any advice would be appreciated, thanks!
