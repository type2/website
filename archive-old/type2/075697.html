Subject: CAD files in the archive idea

My concept is to just standardize on the fairly ubiquitous .pdf file for
uploads to the archive.  Anybody can download them and print them out, they
can't be changed (makes us designer types sleep better), and it's a
reasonably efficient file format.

Is there really anything more to organize?  Sysop folks?
