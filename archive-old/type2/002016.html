&gt; &gt; Also: Do baywindows have M codes like splits? My westy has the plates on
the
&gt; &gt; passenger side dogleg and the bedseat base, but it looks like a bunch of
&gt; &gt; serial numbers. The plate behind the passenger seat looks like vin# and
not
&gt; &gt; much more.
&gt;
&gt; right behind the drivers seat

Later bays have the m-code plate riveted to the support tube that runs
across the front under the dash. It is on the drivers [left] side. You have
to lay upside with a flash light and look up.
