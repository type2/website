Subject: [T2] Canvas cleaning, Cot location.

Greets -

I finally got a child's cot for Itch. Yippie! Two questions.

1) What should I use to clean the canvas? The wifee-poo doesn't think the
washing machine is good. Steam clean? Water &amp; soap &amp; scrub?

2) Where does one store this thing in the bus? It's too long for the top of
the cabinet.
