My 74 Riviera running a 1.8 ltr with Weber progressive gets 15 in the city
and 20 on the highway just like clockwork. Once or twice I got up to 21 or
22 on the highway, but that was in ideal conditions, ie, tailwind, flat
terrain, low humidity, moderate ambient temps. BTW, on the highway I make it
a habit to cruise at 55-60 mph.

&gt; I am surprised that your numbers are this low with the original engine.
My
&gt; Corvair 6 cyl. powered bus does at least that well.  It gets a little over
&gt; 20 on a good day, though that is mixed town/two lane highway driving.  It
&gt; gets way less on the interstate above 50mph or so, largely making the
higher
&gt; power engine little advantage since I end up going slow to get better
&gt; mileage.  The gas tank in my '70 Westfalia just isn't big enough!  GW
