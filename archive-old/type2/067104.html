Subject: More brake problems

Hello all
After replacing one front caliper, both rear brake cylinders,
and my brake pressure valve ( a little do diity in between
the engine and servo) my front brakes continue to not fully
release after the brakes are applied. It is not severe enough
to keep my bus from going but I am concerned about pre-mature
brake and rotor wear. I have new rubber brake hoses ordered and
I hope this will be the fix. If it is not what are some other
possibilities? 
I also ordered a new front shift rod bushing and a new rear 
coupler. I am excited to see how much difference they can make
in my sloppy shifting....
