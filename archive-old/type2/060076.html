On 10/29/98 11:22 AM, ed_at_hintz_dot_org thus spake:

&gt;I am pleased to announce the first release of the Type 2 archive Sherlock 
&gt;plug-in. Yes, that's right, search the archives from your desktop find 
&gt;utility, loads of fun for you and the family. Get your copy now at 
&gt;&lt;http://www.hintz_dot_org/pub/Type2.src.hqx&gt;. Once it's on your computer, 

     If anyone cares, I prettied it up with a custom VW icon. 
Functionality is unchanged. Sherlock will automagically check and 
download it in 30 days, so good things will come to those who wait... 
Those who want pretty icons can download it now.  ;-)


Peace,
