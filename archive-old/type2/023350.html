Subject: noisy valves
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

this morning i adjusted the valves on my 70 camper. I set them to .006 and 
when all was said and done they rapped like a deisel motor. Cylinders 2 and 4 
were really tight and a little overdue for adjustment. Is it o.k. to run with 
the valves clicking like this?
