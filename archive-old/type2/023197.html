Hi folks - got a question or to for you.

I have a handful of heads from various Type IV engines that I have broken 
down along the way. I read in my Bentley that some of the early Type IV 
heads came with larger valves than the later heads (presumably along with 
carbs vs. fuel injection).

All other things constant - will the larger valve heads make more power 
that the small valve heads with dual carbs (such as Dellorto 36mm)?

All other things constant more power with a CIS injection conversion?

With stock L-Jet fuel injection?

I'm in the process of figuring out where I am going with my projects here. 
I have a Type IV powered Beetle I am hopping to drag out of storage and 
pretty up. Which heads to run with the dual 36mm Dells?

Have a stock '78 Westy that may go through a rebuild in a year or two - do 
I need to set aside a set of the larger valve heads for it (with stock 
L-let injection)?

Finally if I plan to do a CIS injection setup for either which heads have 
the bigger payoff?

Thanks for reading my ramblings...
