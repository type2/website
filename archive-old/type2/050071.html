Subject: [T2] Lock and latch luck - a little long

Esteemed Listerinos,

OK, right off the bat, this is not the most earth-shaking news.  But I'm so 
happy I just gotta share it.  
I bought a 70 Bus this past August.  I noticed that the driver's side door 
didn't want to open.  One had to depress the trigger and give the door a yank 
to get inside.  It wasn't all that big a deal.  Just a minor pain.  That I 
ran into every day.  It was simply inconvenient.  That bothered me.  A lot.  
So, I decided to do something about it.
I popped off the inside panel.  I removed the exterior handle.  The PO had 
tried a fix on his own.  He had apparently broken the operating lever off the 
end of the lock cylinder (I found the original at the bottom of the door).  
He put on a new operating lever never realizing that the problem which caused 
all the symptoms in the first place was in the door latch - not the handle.
So I pulled the door latch out.  Sheesh!  A complicated little piece of 
machinery.  Honestly, I'm no locksmith.  I studied the thing for about an 
hour until I figured out how it operated and decided to do a little filing in 
a strategic area.  Viola!  It worked!  I got it all cleaned out and 
thoroughly lubed with Tri-Flow (and if you haven't used this stuff, you're 
missing out on a great product).  I reinstalled the works and the door works 
just like the day it left Hannover - maybe better!
Like I said, this was no big deal.  I'm not too hot when it comes to body 
work.  But these little victories (especially where somebody has tried and 
failed before)  are one of the main reasons I'm into VWs.  Patience and 
ingenuity.  I just love that feeling of triumph and that the bus once again 
functioning in Bristol (or Wolfsburg?) fashion.  It's like meeting the 
challenge head-on.  
Thanks for listening to me ramble.  I am one happy guy.
