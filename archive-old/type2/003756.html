Thank to all those that believe in the VW sound. There is a carhorn.wav out
there that  John M. Perry sent me. If you ever seen the movie HERBIE it
sound just like it.

Thanks to all the true VW FANS

&gt;
&gt; &gt;There's no such thing as &quot;the Volkswagen horn sound&quot;.
&gt; &gt;They used generic single-tone horns, AFAICT from a variety
&gt; &gt;of manufacturers even, and the ones I've heard sound all
&gt; &gt;differently.
&gt;
&gt; I disagree.  VW horns do sound different.  I am tone deaf and can tell if
it
&gt; is a VW horn or not.  There is a guy that lives in my town that has a
pretty
&gt; interesting talent.  He can tell you the make, model and year of your
&gt; vehicle by the sound of the horn.  Over the phone or in person.  I have
&gt; heard him many times guess and the worst he was ever off was by a couple
&gt; years, but he always guessed the make and model.
