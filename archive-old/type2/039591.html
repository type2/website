Subject: Pertronics adjustment

Hello everyone.
I just installed a Pertronics Ignitor in my 72 type 4 dual vacuum
distributer. It seems to work fine except that I can't get the same timing
spread I got when it had points. Before it idled at around 4 degrees ATDC
and tops out at about 38 degrees BTDC. Now in order to get the 38 degrees
of advance needed to run normally I have to advance everything and end up
with 4 degrees BTDC at idle, an 8 degree difference from before. Is there a
reason for this?  What can I do to make the timing spread more normal?
What would be the highest advance I could run without overheating or
otherwise damaging the engine?

Thank you all.
