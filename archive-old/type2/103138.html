Subject: Re: [T2] Horsepower

Ya know this really is a good question. Most people will say torque.
And they are probably right. Type 1 1600 torque somewhere arouond 70-80.
Type 4 between 90 and 100. So more. But not much more.
Near me is a bunch of what I want to call VW freaks for lack of a better
way to describe them. They have type 1 and type 4 engines in cars, 
sandrails,
and busses. When the topic comes up, and it usually relates to the bug so
take note: the general opinion is that the type 4 is NOT really a great
upgrade. The extra torque is fine, but its slower. Doesnt matter what its
put into, the type 1 is the speed king (and power king). Additionally,
modifying a type 4 and modifying a type 1, the type 1 will give you more.
Using the same STROKER technology, which is what the 2 liter is all about,
the type 1 will give you better results for less $.

&gt;The type 1 single port 1600cc engine yeilds 57 Horsepower
&gt;
&gt;The Type 1 dual port 1600cc engine yeilds 60 HP
&gt;
&gt;the Type 4 2000 cc engine yeilds 67 HP
&gt;


Yep. But make that 1600 a 1776 (which isnt that expensive to do) with a
mild cam and add
dual carbs, and lets see what happens.
Ok horsepower goes to about 100. Torque is still low about 80. Huh what 
happened?
We forgot that this still isnt a stroker engine. And that is the point.

So what do you get, a faster enigne, but about the same, but slightly better
hill climbing ability. What to do? Put on a slightly more restrictive 
exhaust,
and mix and match carbs. You can hit a 2 liter type 4 engines specs and 
exceed
them.

Ok so what did you want to know? Here is the answer:
Type 1's are light and can be made powerfull. Type 4's arent particularly 
powerful
but can climb hills steady. Type 4's are thoeretically stronger (built 
tougher)
but cost more to rebuild.
At the end of the day I would prefer a built type 1 over a type 4 due to the 
$.

Is it fast? Yes its very fast. Is it reliable? Appears to be. On hill 
climbing
it just pulls along with very little throttle needed. Is it a slight pain in 
the
ass? Yes. It doesnt like slow starts, is a bit pickey when cold. Do I care?
Nah, I like that I can merge on an expressway.
Like my friends 5 year old said while following me in my friends car said
&quot;Daddy, That bus just takes off! Arent they supposed to be slow?&quot;
Nope.
