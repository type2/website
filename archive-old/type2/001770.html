Subject: Saved a '77 Camper

Just wanted to thank everyone for their interest in the
'77 camper van that I saved from going to the crusher.
It was sold  to someone who is going to put it back on
the road.  I tried to respond in the order that I received 
requests/inquiries about it.  I hope everyone is happy
that it will, once again, be a happy camper.
                                                  Bill &amp; Janyce
