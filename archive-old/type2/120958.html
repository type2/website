Thank you for that back-handed compliment. Your logic is flawed. You 
allude to my knowing more than the engineers; you almost imply that you 
are one of them -- transference of the argument from your accusing me 
of incompetence to the engineers who cannot discuss newer technologies 
and discoveries in auto mechanics since 1984. The flaw is self-evident. 
Furthermore, you go further to not merely accuse me of incompetence, 
but this whole list. I would caution you to not ruffle a lot of 
innocents' feathers in the name of your own wounded pride.

&gt;&gt; Well, while you did not mean to bash me, you sent it on-list, and so
&gt;&gt; made it appear as if I were an incompetent VW owner
&gt;
&gt; Join the club, Tim. Just trying to save you all money. Throw it at 
&gt; whatever makes you feel good. Pretend to know better than those who 
&gt; conceived the design, built and tested it and gave it to you and 
&gt; others to abuse with &quot;feel good&quot; specs.
 
Well thank you for that wonderful permission! To think all these years 
I have been driving my van, I have been running it into the ground! And 
yet I have had under $1000 in total out of pocket repairs! I guess I 
need to go throw some money the way you must have. God forbid I should 
have some how managed to care for this fine van without your constant 
attention to the details.
 
&gt; Stupid is as stupid does. Do as you will, as will I.
 
I guess this &quot;stupid is as stupid does&quot; must surely had been a 
self-confession to the mistake you made for bashing me on the list as 
opposed to going off-list. So, I accept your backward apology, and I 
extend mine forward. I apologize to you for having intruded upon your 
VW bliss by being honest with the potential buyers.
 
&gt; Regards,
 
Ok, rant off. What works for one may not work as well for another. It 
depends upon uses of the vehicle. Sure, one needs oil, coolant, belts, 
ad nauseam to have a happy VW, but please, if you didn't mean to 
publicly bash, you should have gone off-list in your reply. If you were 
so concerned that I was driving toward absolute VW melt-down, then why 
is it that you didn't explain how I managed 122K miles on the van that 
I've (in your opinion) so badly abused? If you wanted to make me look 
like a butt-wipe, then buy my van, and tear it apart and show me that 
you are right, and I was a bad owner! Anyway, whatever.
 
Have a nice one. Caveat Emptor.
