Subject: Fiberglass roof shells?
Date: Mon, 15 Feb 1999 15:43:59 -0500

Anyone out there familiar with a (presumably aftermarket) fiberglass roof
made the bus?  My '71, for example, has a strange one attached - approx. 2'
high up front, which drops to a 1' high luggage carrier in the rear, giving
it the appearance of a 747 (a bubble top?)  So far I've found no information
on the roof, although I've heard the term &quot;california camper&quot; possibly used
in association.  PO couldn't tell me much about the bus' history - he picked
the '71 up at a n. virginia police auction.  I strongly suspect the camper
is a hacked passenger bus, as evidenced by the fugly brown paneled interior
(wolfsburg couldn't design this, could they?)  As bizarre at it looks, I'm
loath to give the bus up - it's got just too many functioning goodies...

Any info on this &quot;high top&quot; bus that someone can share; i.e. manufacturer?
A name for this product?  Thanks,

O. Grant
