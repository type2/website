Subject: Re: [T2] What's the deal with all the cheap busses FS recently?

&gt; So true, I'm across the river from the 71(?) Fort Myers FL bus, but no
&gt; garage and short of $$$. I don't want to be one in a long line of  probable
&gt; previous owners that never got to enjoy it. ( In this case I take it her/his
&gt; moving to NC and having the bus apart it just wasn't worth grief of
&gt; transporting it up there.)


If I could figure out a way to get it home (north of Orlando) I'd buy it
and store it at least out of the sun and most rain till I found a new
owner for it.  Got plenty of room under the shed across the pond (I don't
like to use it for things I need to get to, cause it's a long walk around
the pond.:)


Anyone between Orlando and Ft Meyers have a truck w/ hitch they'll loan
me? :)  I'll rent the dolly...
