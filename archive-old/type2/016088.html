Subject: Dual Kadrons run sweet on 1600 dual port, great power and respons

I finally have the all new Mexican engine and Kadrons running.  The carbs
were really not that hard to dial in...

Despite HOURS of reading, asking over an old-timer VW to help troubleshoot,
the distributor drive gear WAS installed on the wrong stroke (by me) and I
had set the valves on the wrong stroke... which accounted for the terrible
time getting my carbs dialed in :)

I had Doug Berg himself, who lives about 5 miles from me ... troubleshoot
it, where I'm sure he found the valves open 1/4 inch instead of the .006 I
thought I had set them at :)  This account for the very loud clacking and
backfiring through the carbs and muffler at the same time :)

Anyway -- I have had 6 different VW engines over the last year, and this all
new one with the Kadrons beats any other dual port I have run (30/31 pict
and 34-pict).  It surely beats the 1500SP that I had in there...

Doug did a compression check (which I didn't bother on a new engine..) and
said 120 to 110 all around -- I'm told these export Mexican engines are
pretty low on the compression ratio.  His two hours of tuning revealed a
132.5 main jet was right for my engine combined with a &quot;Dual Quiet Pack
Exhaust&quot;.

One blessing out of this is that the valves being so far off made me go
through all the possible tuning of the carbs, I know way more than I would
have needed to know :)  I've tried at least 6 different jet sizes and dozens
of adjustments to all the screws.  The fact that I got it running well
enough to drive 5 miles to Doug's place at 45MPH shows that my carb tuning
skills are better than my understanding-engine-stroke skills :)

Thanks to all who helped.  Next Wednesday we are taking the truck on a 5,000
mile trip from Seattle to Chicago and back.  Wish us luck.

I haven't checked gas MPG, but the Gene Berg Enterprises instructions
suggest that these carbs should do well (24 to 28MPG, but I presume that is
a bug).  The 5,000 mile trip will give us plenty of chance to calculate gas
mileage...

P.S.  I have three different style of manifolds, tried several combinations
of balance tubes, know what gaskets are best, know where to get main jets,
know how the screws work -- let me know if you have questions!  The balance
tube is the most important thing to not overlook, all the written
instructions out there seem to ignore it -- make sure you get an appropriate
hose, don't use just fuel line or something that can't deal with the vacuum
pressure.
