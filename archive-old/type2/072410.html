Fuel airlock/gunk?

Perhaps someone has encountered a problem I have with my 79 baywindow bus?  Engine runs fine, unless I fill up the tank!  That is; I run okay on approximately half a tank of fuel (14 to 20 litres?  fuel gauge is not accurate) but if I fill up more then that from near empty, then the engine runs kind of intermittent, but not mis or backfire.  Especially when you are under power and ease off on the throttle pedal.  The feeling that its going to stop running (engine stop) and then returns when you give it the pedal, but with a jerking hesitant feeling.  Almost like someone turning the engine on/off in quick succession.  With this condition, if left parked up overnight, it seems to correct itself.  But can reappear under load.
My guess was some sort of fuel starvation, as in gunk or water being stirred up when the extra gas slops around the tank after the big fill up.  A friend of mine suggests an air lock, but does not have any recommendations or cure.  Any suggestions, ideas would be most welcome.
