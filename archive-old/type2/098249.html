&gt; &gt;What do you want 30-50 Amps for??? That would be 360 - 600 Watts. Even
&gt; &gt;if you go with 100 Watt high beams, 20 Amps should be plenty. The higher
&gt; &gt;your fuse is rated, the more likely you are to cause damage to your
&gt; &gt;wiring before it blows.

&gt; Point taken, although with the 10 gauge wire I recommended you will have no trouble blowing a 30 amp fuse before the wire is damaged.  50 may be a bit high, I'll admit, but I still think it would work okay.

I run 8-guage wire in my radio installation, along with a 30A breaker.
The radio actually pulls about 20A on transmit, and the 8-ga wire prevents
excessive voltage drop.
