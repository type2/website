Subject: Re: [T2] Mexico



&gt; We vacationed in Mexico recently.  We flew into Cancun, and went immediately
&gt; to Isla Mujeres.  We then went to Cozumel.
&gt; 
&gt; It appeared to me that about 30-50% of the autos in Mexico are air-cooled
&gt; bugs, busses, things, dune buggies, etc.  It was pretty cool.  Lots of
&gt; busses used commercially, actually as busses in Cozumel (if that is what a
&gt; &quot;Collectivo&quot; is.  I have pictures on our photo album.  We rented a late
&gt; '90's beetle, with the top cut out, on Cozumel.

Yes, Mexico is VW heaven!  We've ridden a lot of VWs around Cozumel and if you look on the back streets you can find the shops that 
keep them running.  Mexican auto repair shops are something to behold!  :)

The two buses pictured appear to be the Mexican watercooled conversion of the Brazilian &quot;square top&quot; baywindow design.  They used 
inline fours  They're quieter than the aircooleds and have a bit more power.

A few years back one of the rental agencies had what looked like VW Things for rent.  The only odd thing was that they were 2-door 
vehicles, not 4-doors like all the &quot;real&quot; Things.  Closer inspection revealed that these were fiberglass bodies that mounted onto a 
conventional Beetle pan.  I was never able to track down the source of these bodies and they have since disappeared from the roads.  Too 
bad, as I would have liked to have one and I figure that I could get away with importing a body!
