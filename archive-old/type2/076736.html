Subject: refrig. questions

Hello all. Haven't got the bus running since last time( dead battery) to 
check the backfiring problem. I did install the exhaust and the stock vacumn 
dizzy back on so she should be set. My next question for the bus gurus out 
there is about the refrigerator and control panel on my bus. I took the panel 
off of the bus and found everything still intact and in good shape.  I 
unpluged the plug for the panel and then put a test light on the plug. 
There's no power at any of the terminals. So my question is where does the 
plug pick up power from? Thanks again oh mighty gurus.

Fare Thee Well-Evan
