Actually, you can: I did just that on my '56.  It only required slight
modification to the hole for the church key.  I used an early T-handle from
a rear hatch.  I used the original latch.  Later busses may be a different
story, but this works up until 65 or 66...

buses from 66 on have a different type of engine lid latch.  The early kind
would fit a T handle, but the metal on the lid is not reinforced like on the
decklid for the bit for the lock the lock into.   (The earlier early kind, ie
barndoor, has a different yet engine lid with a locking T handle.) As Thom
says, it can be done, but I personally would hesitate to do that to my engine
lid.  In any case, it is not interchangable for the later buses, which do
have the simpler option of installing a locking latch.
