This doesn't say that this was a solution for rear height problems. Maybe
the springs were support for increased loading under operation conditions.

 
&gt;with trailing arms and stabilizer in the front and an independent
&gt;double-jointed axle with trailing arms and diagonal links and torsion bars
&gt;in the rear, was utilized. However, coil springs were added to the shock
&gt;absorbers because of the increased weight; and the inflation pressures of
&gt;the 185Rl4 steel-belted radial tires were increased to 3.2 bar (46 psi)
