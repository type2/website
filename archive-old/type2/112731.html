Subject: Re: [T2] Propane tank question, Will this work?????????

&gt; --- Cara Ward &lt;caraward_at_rogers_dot_com&gt; Incorrectly stated:

&gt; &gt; hello david I not sure about where you live but
&gt; &gt; here in ontario they will
&gt; &gt; not fill that tank, it needs to have the new saftey
&gt; &gt; valve on it or they won't
&gt; &gt; touch it 

As Karl has pointed out,, If you have been refused when asked to fill that style
of HORIZONTAL tank,,, You are getting erroneous information!

In Ontario, and all Of North America .. HORIZONTAL tanks are EXEMPT.

If you want to replace your valve,, you need one that DOES NOT have the OPD...
as gravity can cause improper operation of this valve on a HORIZONTAL tank.

no best before date
no valve regulations


But they must be safe,, and rust or dents are not acceptable... or leaking
valves.
