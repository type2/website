&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Rob Henley&quot; We got some M8 bolts about a 1/2 inch long from a
&gt; &gt;fastener place, however the flex plate was mangled and bent and the last
&gt; &gt;bolt wouldn't go in. We chopped down a longer bolt and got it to thread and
&gt; &gt;it cleared, so I drove it up and down the highway and it seemed ok. I left
&gt; &gt;and about 6 miles later I heard a pop and the torque converter rattling
&gt; &gt;again. Looks like an engine drop and I NEED A FLEX PLATE at the least. I
&gt; &gt;haven't looked into further damage yet as I just got home.
&gt;

those bolts are I think a grade 7 or so, they are not regular VW type
bolts.    I would suspect you have torque converter damage, when this
happened to me it really mangled the little nubs on the TC.

&gt; Anytime Rob atleast you are home now. I called a wlittle while ago and left
&gt; you a message on the cell phone, I figured the battery was dead. I tried
&gt; your house and the line was busy. Glad to know you got home. If you need
&gt; some help let me know.

glad you got it home, mine had to be trailered....

&gt; Hint when looking for a flexplate try some engine rebuilders if you can't
&gt; find one. AVP told me they would install one on a longblock if I bought one,
&gt; they have them from Auto cores. Guess how many auto cores are converted to
&gt; manuals. Many more than the viseversa approach.

good idea, flex plates are a little hard to come by.  TC are easier
don't forget flex plates have their end play set just like flywheels



good luck
Bob
