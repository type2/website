Subject: Re: tin screws and westy vs campmobile

How the heck do you get those tin screws off? 
- - - -
you mean the engine tine screws, right?   use a big screwdriver, or vice
grips on the screw to loosen, or vice grips on the big screwdriver while
pushing the screwdriver to the screwhead.

question is what is the difference between a westy and a campmobile
- - - -
westfalia is a company aligned with VW that made (makes?) the 'official vw'
camper sold through the dealerships.   Westfalias say westfalia on them, on
the pop top on the post splittys, and on a tag on the bus and/or on the
camper kit.

campmobile i think is just another name for camper van.   I think they used
that word on my ols 73's westy plate
