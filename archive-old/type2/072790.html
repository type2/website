List-
I am now catching up on my Bus work and rather than buying another Bus to
work on I'd like to put together an engine from the three that I have. I
have a 1.7 that is burned up, bottom end turns but one rod bearing binds a
little. This was a Canadian rebuild. PO somehow broke off the oil pressure
sender, burned pistons. Second is a 1.8 that I bought hopeing it would
last. It ran but had a knock that you could hear when the engine slowed
down (rod?). It had overheated many times since the cooling fins were
clogged. Next is the 2L that I got from a VW mechanic who said it was
original and had never been taken apart. It ran for a short time with no
oil preasure (but still ran) I just wanted to replace the bearings.
Everything inside this engine was loose and there was a striped bolt on the
case and one of the bolts that held the case together was also striped
making me think that it had been rebuilt at some time.
If the crank on the 1.8 or 2.0 has not been turned I may be able to replace
the bearings and have a solid bottom end.(?) My question is how do I
measure these parts to find out if they are stock or under sized etc.?  The
shops around here send all there work out and act like they really don't
want to do it. I am on my own. Is there a measuring tool I can buy?
Depending on which heads are not cracked I was even considering putting an
engine together that is 1.7 on one side and 1.8 on the other (a 1.75?) I
will also have to construct a test rig from an old transmission housing so
I can run the engine without putting it in a Bus.
I would gladly put all of this aside if I could find a rust free split
window Westy that needs work.
What do you think?
