Subject: Rear brake job on a '73 (long)

Couple of new tricks (maybe) within.

Recently I noticed that something on my bus was dragging.  When I would come
to a stoplight, the bus would not roll when there was a very slight incline in
places that it used to roll.  I could not figure out which wheel it was at
first, and when I jacked the bus up in the air, all four wheels turned easily
by hand.  Later I realized that I had waited too long to lift the bus - if I
had done it immediately after driving I would have found the culprit.
Anyway...

A few days later I had to leave town for an overnighter to San Diego for work
and I always take my bus to the airport because it is less likely to get
stolen from the parking lot than the Mustang.  It is a 42 mile drive each way.
On the way home after the trip, the drag got worse.  I slowed down and stayed
off of the freeway as much as I could, and when I got home I did the touch
test on the wheels.  The right rear hubcap was slightly warm while the left
was not.  Aha, says me, I bet this drum is dragging.  Feeling proud of myself,
I verify my theory by poking my index finger through the hole in the wheel and
touching the drum.  Burned the crap outta my finger.  I am so stooopid.

I waited until the next morning and clamped a vice grip over the far end of
the right rear brake hose so I could at least drive the bus around while I
waited for parts to arrive.  Sure enough, no more dragging.  Plugged brake
hose for sure.  Ordered two new ones from Bus Depot.  I knew the rear shoes
were pretty worn so I ordered new Pagid shoes at the same time.  The cylinders
had been replaced a few years back so I left those alone.

The parts arrived 10 calender days later (not fast, but within the promised
time frame) and I began the swap.  First problem was, as usual, removing the
rear drums.  I removed the two 11mm bolts holding the drum to the hub but the
drum would not slide off.  Here we go again.  I loosened the adjusting stars
where possible (one was siezed so I couldn't turn it) and hit the drums a bit
with a 4lb sledge.  Then I discovered a new trick that helped.  I got a rather
small flatblade screwdriver, a cheap Stanley one that I don't care about
(because it will likely bend) and inserted it sideways into the hole for the
11mm bolt.  By forcing the screwdriver between the drum and the hub and
prying, you can *ahem* encourage the drum outward a little ways.  This
combined with the aformentioned loosening of shoes and hammering of drums was
enough to get both drums off.

I then did something I've been meaning to try for a while.  Trick #1 - I put
the drums in the vice and ground off the small lip at the edge that the shoes
were hanging up on.  Took about half an hour with a power drill and grinding
stone, for both drums.  I know I could have simply replaced the drums, as they
were barely in spec but the cheapskate in me took hold and resisted spending
the 120 clams for new drums when the old ones were still serviceable.  The
rear brakes don't do that much anyway and thinner drums are only going to be a
problem if you overheat them on a long downgrade in which case you drove too
fast anyway.  Other than that, they work just as well as new $120 drums.

Replacing both hoses was fairly easy once I committed to getting under the bus
and getting dirt in my hair.  Same for the brake shoe replacement except that
my new Pagid shoes didn't come with the emergency brake arms and the old arms
were rivited to the old shoes!  Crap.  I washed my hands and went inside to
consult the good old type2 library.  An article by Sean Bartnik on Rear Brake
Shoe Replacement was relevent (even though it was on a Vanagon) but didn't
help me with the emergency brake level problem.  I then started searching the
archive and found a good writeup by my old pal Steve Dolan:
http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/type2/082575.html

Thanks Steve!!  This writeup spelled out the problem clearly and I was
relieved to see that a nut and bolt was an acceptable method of attaching the
emergency brake arm to the shoe, because I have nuts and bolts lying around.
I drilled out the rivets holding the arms to the old shoes and attached them
to the new shoes with the specified M10 bolts which I retrieved from my
ever-growing bucket-O-bolts.  I used locking nuts AND mangled the threads that
extended past the nuts by squeezing them very hard with a vise grip.  I don't
think they will be coming loose.

During reassembly I started thinking about the frozen star adjusters.  I have
done the rear brakes a few times on the bus now, and no matter how well I
clean the adjusters and coat with anti-sieze, they always tighten up from rust
after a year or two.  I don't like the idea of disassembling my drum brakes
every year to prevent this.  I am pretty sure that the problem is caused by my
mangled backing plates - the adjuster holes were bent up by the PO which
prevented the little rubber plugs from staying in place, which probably let
water in and caused the problems with the star adjusters.  I'm sure lots of
people on this list have the same problem.  I bought some new plugs hoping
that the softer rubber would help them stay in place, but no luck.  I
flattened out the adjusting holes by carefully tapping bits of mangled metal
back down into place, which helped but the plugs still wouldn't quite stay in.
Then I had an idea.

Trick #2 - The new plugs had a slight recession in the bottom that is a bit
smaller than the diameter of the plug itself.  I found a washer that was
slightly larger than this recession and threaded a small (but short and thick)
sheet metal screw into the center of the plug to force the washer into the
recession, which caused the plug to bulge out at the bottom (both from the
screw and the washer probably).  Voila, the plugs now fit tightly!  In fact,
after making this mod to all four plugs, one was too tight - I had to back the
screw out a little and grease it to get it in.  Now I can drive the bus in the
rain again without worrying what it is doing to my nice new brake shoes.  And
now I have four new brake hoses (did the fronts a couple of years ago) so I
shouldn't have to worry about dragging brakes again for a while.  I put
everything back together and tightened the star adjusters until the drums
would barely move.  Then I removed the two 11mm bolts again and was able to
easily remove the drum!  I think grinding that ridge off was worth it.
