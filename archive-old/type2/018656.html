Yes this works.  I now have 76 heat exchangers with manifolds
in my 1978 Loaf.   Works fine,and they sit a tiny bit higher up
giving some protection from gravel roads.

&gt; If you can't get the U-pipes, a local guru  (very resectable mechanic/body

&gt; (he has a 74) would fit OK to the later 78 heads, but you have to get the
&gt; early muffler also, with the 4 connections for the heater/manifolds.  He
&gt; said the only reason they went to the separate manifold/upipes/heaterbox
&gt; (read more places to leak) was to accomodate the insertion of the catalytic
&gt; for California.   Ron Salmon verified this should work, having gotten it
&gt; from AVP
