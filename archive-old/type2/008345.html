Just to add my 0.2c.......

When phoning around for a replacement tranny for my 73 bus (but with 2 litre
pancake engine), I received wisdom that here in the UK the 'boxes are
different for 68-71, 71-75 and 75-on. The early one has a different front
mounting (I don't know about rear trans mount). I had to swap the bellhousing
and retain the 2 litre one to use the 228mm clutch, but apart from that it
was a 1600cc gearbox. And I thought ALL Type 2's had a rear engine bracket?

BTW, somebody mentioned they could pull their trans in 20-30 minutes, how on
earth so fast? It took me an hour to undo the driveshafts!!! Was he using a
powered ratchet driver? Did he not have to rotate the wheels to get to all
the driveshaft nuts? FLT for lifting van over drivetrain (took me 30 mins
to drag it on a board out and to rear of van!)?

&gt;Corrobation here...
&gt;'78 = tranny hangers (engine out)
&gt;My spankin' new '69 Riviera = No hangers (Only by feeling around, I haven't
&gt;had the engine out yet)

&gt;A Type2 list member is someone willing to crawl around under their bus,
&gt;getting goobered up with tranny mung, at the slightest provocation.

&gt;&gt; Moral: '68-71, no original rear trans support.  On US models at least
&gt;&gt; (can't speak for others).  '72-79, supports on bellhousing.  
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Any corroborative evidence?
