&gt; Please Help,.
&gt; 
&gt; After the right front dics brake on my 71 bus had been giving me more and
&gt; more problems and finally stopped retracting from contact with the disc, I
&gt; decided to rebuild the caliper today.  I got the pistons off, cleaned them
&gt; and the bores with soem fine grit sandpaper.  Then I cleaned everything in
&gt; brake fluid, gave them a shot of assembly lube and put them back in place
&gt; with a new o-ring and the old, cleaned , dust covers.  After I blead the air
&gt; out of them through the top bleeder valve, (bottom one is broken in the
&gt; whole and being fixed tomorrow), I went out for a test run.....
&gt; Worse binding than before!!!!  When I got back home from a ride of about 2
&gt; miles at about 30mph, the luggs were so hot I could not touch them for about
&gt; 15 minutes.
&gt; My question in WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON|???  I figured if I rebuilt the
&gt; caliper that would solve the bindin problem but now it is worse.  Does
&gt; anyone thing the lack of bleeding from the bottom bolt could have caused
&gt; this problem??
&gt; Any and all help is appreciated as I am leaving for a cross country trip on
&gt; thursday!
&gt;

Kevin: 
You need new rubber hoses. They deteriorate from the inside and collapse
plugging the return flow of fluid. They will pass fluid one way but the
pressure to apply is MUCH greater than that to retract.
Might as well do the rears, too. Take the line nuts apart verrry
carefully because the steel lines tend to rust into the nuts.
Hope that helps.
