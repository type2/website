I ditched the p.o.-installed passenger tires on my camper this weekend.  I'm 
so happy.  I found a Dunlop-made, OE spec tire that's branded &quot;Federal.&quot;  
$62 ea. for a 6 ply and $65 ea. for an 8 ply in 185R14-D.  Out the door for 
under US$225.  I have no idea what the aspect ratio is, but if it's good 
enough for VW it's good enough for me.  =)  I love how well it handles in 
the wind now and road noise is almost nill.  I bet the P185/70R14's that 
were on there before were screaming under protest.  And I'm gonna save the 
Empis something else or maybe sell them to something that will scream for 
another reason.  What was I thinking?  I love my big, moony hub caps.  
Body-color would be even better than chrome.

I also finished the brakes.  I had no idea that there were two cylinders per 
side up front.  It took a while to track down all the parts, but at least 
the drums are stout and had plenty of material to each take a turn on the 
lathe.  The matser cylinder checked out OK too.  Whew!  Just gotta finish 
sealing up the engine bay and we'll be ready for Summer.  On the road 
again...
