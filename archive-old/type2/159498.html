The plan was to head out from Denver to Moab for three days of camping 
and photographing in Arches and Canyonlands National Parks.  I was then 
going to meet up with my Dad somewhere like Telluride.  It rained like 
hell in Moab and I ended up leaving a day early.  The photography wasn't 
the best, but the bus got lots of looks in the NPs.  The new camper 
interior and bed I made worked out great.  I saw several Vanagons and a 
few Bays in and around Moab.

Here's a couple of pics I took at the campground.

Here's a few from Arches NP.  One is the area known as Park Avenue and 
the others Turret Arch as seen through North Window.

Dad turned up in Ouray, Colorado and I was off to meet him.  Wouldn't 
you know just as I left Moab the rain stopped.  It was around 5 or 6 
hours to Ouray, and the drive was beautiful.  I stopped for a rest and a 
meal and snapped this one.

So Dad and I meet up and of course it rains for the next three days.  We 
had a lot of fun taking pictures together.  They're all still in RAW 
format, but I'll share when I get around to going through them.  I ended 
up in Silverton one day and saw a hightop Bay outside a coffee shop.  It 
had a weird front mounted spare on the bumper.  It also had a radiator 
on the bumper and according to the owner a toyota engine.  It was cool 
looking.  As I was leaving a gas station somewhere in Colorado a barn 
door splittie pulled in.  We waved at each other.  It was well past it's 
prime looking, but beautiful nonetheless.  Below are some pics I took 
the day we left.  I almost made it to the top of Yankee Boy Basin, but 
it got a little bit too steep.
