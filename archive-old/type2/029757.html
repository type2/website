It's interesting to note that it is relatively common to &quot;rebuild&quot; vintage
aircraft where the only original part is the data plate.  Cars don't get
the benefit of this liberal interpretation.

 If I remember, BeetleMex reuses 
&gt; &quot;your&quot; chass-

Correct.  They take pans from late swingaxle (67, 68) bugs, which is the
&quot;chassis&quot;
for legal purposes, and put mexican parts on them.  Unfortunately, a bus
is a unit body vehicle, so the body _is_ the chassis.

There is (was?) another company that was importing bugs on their original
pans and adding their own VIN plate.  I'm not sure how they did this, but
I suspect that they were calling the bug a &quot;kit car&quot;.

My feeling is that the expense of importing a bus would far exceed that of
buying a baywindow and paying to have it completely restored.
