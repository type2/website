Likely solenoid when hot needs too much current to kick-the run from the
battery to the front and back is too far.   You can bang on the solenoid
with a hammer and it usually will start.  _To get you going, you can
push/jump it, or lie underneath and short the wire from ignition to
solenoid directly to the battery positive and it will kick. I kept a 6&quot;
piece of house wiring with an alligator clip at one end just for this
purpose.  
Best fix is to put in the bypass relay- I had same problem, got tired of
lying underneath, and used the relay over a few years now.
