Subject: Can anyone ID this spice rack??

Hey Y'all,
There was an interesting spice rack attached to the
cargo door of a 67 parts bus I recently obtained. It
is a combination spice rack\table. The shelves and
frame of the spice rack are made of metal, then there
is a hinged table top attached. When the table top is
folded down, it closes the spice rack. Attached is a
link to the picture, I'd love it if someone could give
me any info on this. either it is from a strange
camper coach builder or maybe it is hame-made kinda
thing. Any info is appreciated! Heres the pic:

Thanks &amp; PEACE! John Baker
