I put in a winter rye grass lawn this weekend and took second place at SW
Bug-in III! ROFMAO!

It was one of those Saturdays in which you don't shower because you are
going to be getting into &quot;it.&quot; Saturday afternoon I went to the local
HomeDepot and bought 50 bags of Composted Cow Doo-Doo and some seed. Hauled
it home in my '57 single cab and was the hit of the traffic world as the
engine heat affected the rear part of the bed. Came home, did the lawn
thing, &lt;pee~ewe!&gt; and thankfully showered. =)

Sunday AM, Mrs. VanBondo and I drove the same (poop carrier of a) single cab
out to SW Bug-in III and met up with the BUCKWILDE family (list member) and
a few other folks. We decided to enter in the single cab class. Ooops,
another single showed up late... We ended picking up a plaque for Second
Place. Heck, I didn't even, reprimer the old primer, put hub caps on it,
sweep out the UFO remaining chunks of &quot;lawn ornaments&quot; out of the back or
Nuttin! Honestly, there were a few nice rides there but still on a totally
different planet from the big deal show scenes. Blue Nelson's Dormobile and
a few others of various types I, II, III etc. were real nice.
The show was OK, started late, swap was fair to better than fair. The
world's record of quickest VW fell at the show 7.?? at 185mph &lt;dragster&gt; Ron
Lumus  of RLR was clocked at 155mph (I think in the 8's??) Sorry, Im not a
racehead.

If you didn't drive from where ever to make the show then you probs saved
gas and time. I gave the show a resounding &quot;Eh?&quot;
