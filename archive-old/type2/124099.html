Subject: 1976 bus for sale

I have seen a 1976 bus Sportmoblie forsale.  It looked very rust free, and the
windshield even looked free of rust.  Not uncommon in West Texas.  This bus
has been forsale for awhile.  They are asking $1250.
Mechinally? I have no idea.  I would love to see this bus to go to a go  home.
I do not know the owner of this bus, and have not talked to them.  If someone
is interested, e-mail me, and I will give you the phone number on the forsale
sign.
