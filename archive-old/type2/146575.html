Thanks Tim! I concur on Death Valley. just what I wanna do, spend the day
in 120 degree heat with the scorpions, snakes and tarantulas with such
glorious (read &quot;zero&quot;) scenery in an air cooled vehicle! Not to mention
looking at an Atlas to figure out it's 428 miles away from Pheonix in
another state! As mentioned, to each his own...now the 4 corners or Arches
I get. Just me I guess. Read many of Abbey's books which were great but when I'm in the desert I don't get it anyway...
We had no problem with crowds when camping or hiking and the people
we ran into in fact were terrific in regards to the bus (lovingly restored
by Chris F. before I bought it I add). Many &quot;ole hippies&quot; struck up long
conversations with us not only at The Canyon but every other place we
stopped. Including a park ranger who missed hers back in Vermont but was
planning on bringing it out the following season after an engine rebuild.
I hope to follow suit on your hikes down the interior with my hiking pal of
20 years later this year.
I haven't floored the bus ever so hopefully I won't toast it. She ran like
a champ the whole way to and fro and barely broke a sweat.
Anybody out there got any extra almond/white camper T moulding they wanna
get rid of?
