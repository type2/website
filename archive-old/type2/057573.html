Subject: Pushrod tubes

Just found some tube weirdness. In a box of assorted stuff I got with
my '81, there were 8 shiny new pushrod tubes. Thought I might as well
use them -- two went in fine, the other 6 won't go noway even with the
rubber off. The big end is too big. These even have the paper still on
them, one of the things it says is &quot;Dealer $5.49, RBI $3.49&quot;. Never
heard of RBI. There's also a little tag on a couple that says &quot;Made in
Taiwan&quot;. Pretty crummy quality control, which is weird because I buy
lots of computer stuff made in Taiwan and it's usually pretty top-notch.
