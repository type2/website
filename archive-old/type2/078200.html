Subject: Re: startup oil pressure

 Melissa Colombo sent:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; when we start up the bus (in cold weather) the oil
&gt; &gt; pressure rockets to 60psi. after the oil temp rises
&gt; &gt; the pressure levels off to 40psi (highway speeds.)
&gt; 
&gt;Response:  Good! Engines are supposed to have a higher startup oil pressure than they maintain in general operation; this gets oil to the bearings quickly.

   Whoa- remember oil pressure is a measure of resistance given a
constant push!  The high pressure seen does not prove oil is getting to
the bearings faster- in fact it may flow more slowly as my gauge shows-
in cold weather, it takes longer to measure that 60 psi than when
starting in hot weather.  Given a constant pump source at a set rpm,, a
high pressure can result from either a dense oil to push (ie, cold) or
from very tight tolerances resisting the flow through of the oil as it
lubricates.  The latter will show when the oil is hot; the former shows
as it is cold out.  My &quot;tired&quot; 229,000 mi engine shows 60 psi also at
cold startup, but goes to 22 psi when the oil is over 240 degrees.
     I believe the modern engines have both a bypass valve that opens
when the pressure is too high (allowing oil cooler to be bypassed, and a
volume control valve that opens to dump excess oil to maintain a
constaint maximum high pressure.  Thus I suspect if your tolerances are
too tight, you could starve the bearings until the oil temp is higher. A
good reason to have a working thermostat in a new engine?
