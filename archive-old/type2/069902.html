Subject: Re: What are overriders? (f)

&gt; You do not have overriders because, by God, you have a sense of decorum. ;)

That does it! I want a set for the '73!  BusBoys, are you listening?  or
must I get a machine shop to carve up a set off an old barn door? :-0

but barndoors don t have over riders, except of couse, on the ambulances.
 these had front overriders to make it easier to pull the buses up hill, or
with horse or oxen
