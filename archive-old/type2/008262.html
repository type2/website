Subject: Only 55 MPH!
Mime-Version: 1.0


In light of all of the talk lately about &quot;slow&quot; busses and impatient people
driving behind them in their zippy cars or bigass SUV's, I have a sincere
question that I would like you older dudes and dudettes to take a stab at. 
Back before '72 (or was it '75) the speed limit was 70 mph, 65 mph at night,
65 trucks.  As far as the speed limit goes, it seems as though we have the
same situation today as we did back then.  What I want to ask is, &quot;What is
different about people back then as compared to today's folks?  Why is it that
when I am tooling down the road at 50 - 55 mph I encounter more than my share
of impatience?  Was it the same back then?&quot;   I'm 38 and don't remember much
about driving habits of motorists back then and therefore can't compare.  Back
then there were bookoos of busses and they all apparently lived happily with
Mopar stuff and the like.  Same speed differential between vehicles as today. 
What is different? Anyone?

Thanks!
