Subject: Westfalia Electrical Diagrams??

Hi all,

Does anyone know where I can obtain a electrical diagram for all the 
Westy electrical toys?  I need one for a '78 and it needs to show all the
connections to the little panel(fridge,voltmeter/battery tester,city 
power).  It also needs to show the wiring for the ac/dc converter, the
Dometic fridge and the two AC outlets as well as the water pump.
The panel says Delta Six Industries on the bottom.Anybody have their #?
I recently aquired this bus and I don't know how it is wired, but the 
water pump, fridge and battery tester don't work.  The only thing that
works is the 2 AC outlets.
Any technical help or help with finding diagrams would be eternally 
appreciated.

Ernie
