Reset?  I overclocked mine.  It now rivals most P2 350 MHz systems.  When I
did this my heating system became such that I had to open windows to cool
off  - and my torsion bars leveled out - kewl!  Fearing the worst case
scenario for Y2K I ported WindowsCE to run natively on the ECM - I added a
USB port to the ECM so I could network my laptop with the bus using  BusLink
2.0 (the updated version added USB support).  I can now dial in my own smog
checks, adjust FI flow rates and monitor critical systems via my
palmtop(support for palmtops added in V2.0) or laptop.  I can also jam or
cloak those pesky radar guns Smokey has a habit of pointing at our
speed-monger busses into thinking I'm doing the speed limit in a Yugo.

Is it April 1st again?  Naw, just Friday!!!

p.s. Berg actually has a software package that does link with your ECM,
optional ICBM launcher sold separately.  The package cost what most of our
busses cost new, not including the sensors and relays to connect to the
heads, FI and ECM.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; OK so maybe I'm overreacting, but does the Type 4 engine ECM for the
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;  FI&gt; use anything that may be affected by the Y2K problem.

&gt; &gt; Yes, you really should be very careful driving it on 1-1-2000 and not to
&gt; &gt; forget 29-2-2000 (2000 is a leap year although many people think not!).
Also
&gt; &gt; you have to take into account that since the ECM was probably made in
&gt; &gt; Germany it is off by 6 to 9 hours from US time so you could start having
&gt; &gt; problems on new-years eve.
&gt;
&gt; I was amazed that by resetting the ECM internal clock to Greenwich Mean
&gt; Time +2 I was able to increase MPG from 22 to 35, and top speed from 70
&gt; to 93!!!!
