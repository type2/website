Dear Steve,

I've always entered GTNP from Yellowstone. The roads to and from GTNP from
Yellowstone are among the easier ones to drive in the area. Once you're in
Jackson Hole, the roads are pretty level. It may that the best way to enter
GTNP is from Yellowstone rather than from the south or east.

Speaking of steep roads, because of a mid-June snowstorm last year, we
could not enter Yellowstone via our first choice, the east entrance, so we
entered the park through the northeast entrance, near Cooke City, which
added many miles and several hours to our trip. There was a vicious head
wind from the west as we attempted the pass, along with occasional snow
showers. The first pass west out of Cody is called Dead Indian Pass, which
is long with steep portions. The strong head winds made it worse. I was
just hoping that its name wouldn't be changed to Dead VW Pass! Descending
into snowcovered Sunlight Basin, however, made it all worthwhile.
