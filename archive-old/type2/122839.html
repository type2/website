Subject: RE: [T2] Burnt bus fund

  Chris (burnt bus) is a bus person. The reason she owns (owned) a bus was
to transport her kids and all the gear needed. A bus is much more economical
then any other vehicle that can serve the same purpose. Cheap to fix, user
friendly and has a great support group behind it. Yes she could get
something different (which she will do till she finds another bus), but she
is part of the bus community, the camp-outs etc. You don't go to a BUS
campout in a Celica. 
  She had to make a choice and the bus community swayed her in the right
direction. She is not money flush and cannot afford to own 2 cars so she
made a decision, which watching the list have proved that there is support. 
  If you burned up your Toyota I doubt if there is any group that could
really care.
  There is more to owning a bus then the paranoid feeling of it burning up.
  It's like when my shop almost burned down a few years ago, I could have
thrown in the towel and did something else, but it is the bus community that
supported me and helped me make the decision to stay in it.

ps. We have almost 800 dollars in the buy chris a bus fund so far and more
coming in. The money is going to buy her a bus only, when the right one is
found.

No white flags necessary. We disagree on this one - so be it.
I don't like being the bad guy and this is probably a case where I should've

silently disagreed and moved on.

I've been fortunate enough to have enough extra time and money to enjoy 
owning a bus.
That will not always be the case, that's why I call it a luxury. When my 
baby is born in this Spring, I will probably have to sell the bus and 
tighten up my finances. To me, that's the only responsible decision I can 
make.

I see lots of cases where people are consistenly making poor decisions and 
asking for help, only to perpetuate more bad decisions. That was my reaction

when I read that. I acknowledge not knowing all the details and 
circumstances, but was compelled to point out the possibility of this being 
such a case.

If anyone wants to have a last word, I promise I won't say any more on the 
matter.
