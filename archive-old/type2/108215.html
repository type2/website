Subject: Re: [T2] 2.ol rebuild

Since you're styling this a &quot;rebuild&quot; I assume there's lot's of new parts.
Maybe you could detail these new parts in your next post.  It sounds like
the valve train geometry is fouled up but it's hard to know where to &quot;look&quot;
at this point.

The fact that both valve settings on the 3/4 side are &quot;too tight&quot; suggests
to me the pushrods are, in effect, too long, which really means that
something else is too short.  Was there a compression cut on the head on
that side without compensating shims?  Did you not shim the 3/4 side or use
shorter shims than on the 1/2 side?  Were there spacers under the rocker
pedestals on the 3/4 side that didn't get installed?  There's other things
that can cause the a valve train geometry foul-up, but these are common.

&gt; While rebuilding our 2.0l engine I got it together to the point of doing
the
&gt; valve adjustment, we put a 1 step up cam from eagle in it just in case
this
&gt; has something to do with it. so set the #1 valves then turned the engine
over
&gt; 180 and went to set the #4 valves, and the rocker is within .006 inch from
the
&gt; valve bearly enough room to get the fealer gauge in there. the #1 side and
2
&gt; were fine enough room to set the valves nicely, but the 3 and 4 side is
&gt; extremely close, what does anyone think of this. All went well with
building up to
&gt; this point. thanks
