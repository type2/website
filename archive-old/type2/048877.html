Okay, my &quot;bus giving&quot; friend finally returned from his vacation and will be
giving me his 76 westy (orange...no name yet.)

Here's some info, before I pose my question:

Esentially, it has been sitting for about 2 years now.  We started it up
about a month ago...not too many problems there.  I will have to evict a
family of mice that have taken up residence in it though.  When it was still
a daily driver, he would have to &quot;warm it up&quot; for about 5-10 minutes,
otherwise it would stall on him.  Good body, beams.  Factory air
conditioning installed, but I am unaware of its condition.  Needs a new
canvas, kick panels, door seals, door handles...and a killer deck for all of
my bootlegs.

I believe it has an '80 engine in it, FI,...originally, I thought aircooled
T2 engines were only produced up until '79, but I'm not the expert.

I will be making this bus road trip worthy to the best of my ability.  I may
not be a mechanic, but I have no problems learning and getting dirty.

So, here's the question....(with everything above to consider.)

I would like a list of suggestions/recommendations of things that I should
service...belts and such.  Is there a specific order I should follow?  I
have until May to get the vehicle ready, so being thorough is already on the
brain.

I would like to still be able to drive it now and then to continually
listen/check for potential issues.

Sorry for the long email...I tend to ramble.  I just want to be well
prepared for my trip...especially mechanically.

Gobble gobble,
Missy:)
