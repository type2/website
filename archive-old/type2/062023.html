Subject: cold weather oils

right now in the moderate (if not sunny) im unning Castrol SAE 30 most of the
year, and using 20-5o in the hot part of the summer. Whats the current
thought on cold weather oils for those of you who run your cars through the
winter? When I lived in VT, I think I used 10-40 till thanksgiving, and 10-30
from thanksgiving to around the ides of march, but its been 7 years so I
might have forgotten something. (like the joy of an un- or poorly heated car
at 20 degrees F)
