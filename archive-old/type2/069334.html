Subject: Followup on propane regulator

Charles Webb reminded me that Delta 6/Euro-American sold these regulators. I
talked with Pete out there from whom I had bought some sink parts earlier and
bought a new one for around $54. 

In addition, he threw in a little product education concerning the fact that
propane pieces are reverse thread to distinguish them from ordinary plumbing
items. That would have been an interesting surprise to learn the hard way.
Also, because I'm such a good guy, he threw in an owner's manual for the
fridge to help me figure out why the 12v mode doesn't work.
