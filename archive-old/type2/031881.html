&gt; the engine compartment is at a NEGATIVE pressure (slight vacuum), since the
&gt; carb and fan are sucking the air out of it.

It is certainly true that the carb and fan are sucking air out of the 
engine compartment. It is also true that the air scoops are 
sticking out into the passing airstream and ramming air into the 
engine compartment. Moreover, the cross sectional area of the air 
scoops is considerably larger than the cross sectional area of 
the carb and the engine fan intake combined. The pressure of the engine 
compartment at any given instant will be some function of rate of air in 
divided by rate of air out. It is hard for me to believe that pressure is 
actually negative in the engine compartment when the bus is at freeway 
speed. 

I have definitely noticed that the output of my heater is strongly dependent
on my rate of travel, i.e. very low when I am at idle and more and more as my
speed increases. Heater air is also drawn out of the engine compartment by
the heater fan, then pushed through my leaky heater boxes and all the long
way up to the front of the bus. The speed of the heater fan does not vary.
The only other thing I can think of that might affect this system is positive
pressure in the engine compartment when driving at speed. If there is in fact
negative pressure in the engine compartment at speed as you assert then
please explain to me how it is that I get a lot more air out of my heater
vents at speed while getting almost nothing at idle. There is a strong 
positive correlation between heater air into the passenger compartment 
and rate of travel. If air pressure in the engine compartment were 
negative, as you assert, then I would expect my heater to push less air 
at speed, not more, because it would be laboring against a pressure 
gradient.

If there were negative pressure in the engine compartment at speed, as you
assert, then I would expect engineering solutions that put more cool air in
the engine compartment to enhance engine cooling. Things like extra air
scoops or bigger air scoops would enhance cooling. Why then didn't those wise
VW engineers do it that way? Why are these not popular after market
modifications?

&gt; This is also why having ALL the engine tin and sealing rubber in place is so
&gt; vital. One small piece of tin missing (or rip in the seal) and your engine
&gt; temps shoot up.

It is definitely a good idea to have all tin and seals in place if air 
pressure is positive in the engine compartment at speed. If air pressure 
were negative as you assert then I would expect missing tin on the 
leading edge of the engine to let cool air in and enhance cooling of the 
engine. It is not efficient for cooling to make the cooling system labor 
against a pressure gradient to get cooling air. Obviously it is also not 
good to let hot air leak back into the system in any way.

&gt; What you choose to do with this information is up to you.

Thanks. :-)
