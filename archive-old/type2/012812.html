&gt;&gt; It is my understanding that you can also use a simple T-fitting at the fuel
&gt;&gt; outlet on the tank to avoid changing tanks.  I can't imagine why this can't
&gt;&gt; be done as long as both fittings are in the unpressurized line between the
&gt;&gt; fuel pump and the tank.  It would save a lot of trouble.  Has anybody had
&gt;&gt; problems doing it this way?  I recently installed a 79 2.0 FI in a 74 Westy
&gt;&gt; using this method.  
&gt;
&gt;I'll admit, I haven't tried it.  But it really doesn't sound like a very
good 
&gt;idea.
&gt;
&gt;It seems to me that the way you've got it set up you'd be VERY susceptible
to 
&gt;vapor-lock.  The original system was set up to dump the excess fuel back
into 
&gt;the tank.  That fuel has just been passed through your (very) hot engine 
&gt;compartment.  If you're recirculating that fuel right back through the
pump and 
&gt;into the lines in the engine compartment it's going to get hotter and hotter.

The miller K-jet conversion tried this on the 914 and it works some of the
time
and vapor locks some of the time.  They got around tank mods by making a
little subtank which holds maybe a quart that the return goes into and the
feed sucks out of.  A good thought.  I don't know about the idea either of
the T
could be problematic.  One could plumb a return into one of the vent
fittings on
the early tank '72-74 are I think double vents, '68-'71 is single so you
couldn't
do it.  That would just mean pulling the firewall or maybe you could get to
the
pass side one on a '74 through the access plug above the wheelhousing.
Dumping it in the top would be same difference as the bottom.  But you would
be illegally modifying part of your emissions system.
