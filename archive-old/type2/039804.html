Subject: Tools to carry

For over 25 years I have had a pair of needle nose pliers that have a 
90 degree bend to the jaws. It has been one of the handiest tools 
around, the bend makes it easier to see what you are grabbing. You 
can also sort of pry with it while unscrewing/unbolting in 
conjunction with another tool, good for stripped threads.

I also like to carry one of those long reach pickup tools. I like to 
have both the magnetic and &quot;grasping&quot; types, the little jaws on 
graspers seem to break over time, so have had several over the years.

I would love to have one of those little TV cameras like my dentist 
uses to show me the inside of my mouth.
