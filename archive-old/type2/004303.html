The original question asked :

&quot;What engine came standard in a 1973 bus delivered to the US?&quot;

That is what I answered!

He didn't ask what you could put in it. Hell, you could put a friggin'
Sherman tank engine in if you wanted to!

&gt; &gt; &gt; have, it did, but I've been wrong many times before.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, would it matter if it was manual or automatic?
&gt; &gt; &gt; Just wondering...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 1700, 2 carbs.
&gt; &gt; FI did not arrive until 74, and then it was only on the California 1800
&gt; &gt; w/auto trans. 75 all states/all trans got FI.
&gt;
&gt; HOWEVER, the 71-72 1700  and  73-74 1800 type 4 engine that was actually
&gt; in a type 4 had fuel injection, and it can be used in a bus with little
&gt; modification,  I have run a 71 1700 with Fuel Injection in my 78 bus while
&gt; it's engine was out getting rebuilt
