Subject: FS: Green Plaid/curtains

Hello list,

I'm in the process of combining a '78 westy and a '79 westy...Help me pay 
for a paint job by purchasing some or all of the following.

For sale/trade from the '78 Sagegreen Westy:

-The two upper bed cushions-good cond.
-Lower cushion (the one over the engine)-ok cond.
-Complete green curtain set with rods, snaps, screws, ect.-normal fading, 
good cond.
-also I have a green windshield curtain that I could sell seperate.
-if you need something else from a '78 Westy let me know maybe the PO didn't 
destroy it.

P-mail me off list if interested, make offer. I don't mind shipping (Utah) 
so long as you pay for it.

I need an unchipped small main cabinet door from a '76-'79(the one for the 
water tank below the drawers) Also I could use an undented non-rusty engine 
decklid for a 78.

Thanks,
Brandt
