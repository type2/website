Subject: Re: [T2] Charcoal Canister for '72 Bus

Hiya All,

Unfortunately I do not have access to a digital camera this weekend but I do 
have both emissions canisters right in front of me. Here are the 
dimensions........

113 201 801A...........length - 202 mm.  width - 135 mm.  height - 78 mm.
circumference - 335 mm.  construction is metal

175 201 801A...........length - 255 mm.  diameter (at largest point, case is 
tapered)- 100 mm.  average circumference - 270 mm.  construction is plastic

As you can tell by the dimensions of each, 175 is NOT a good fit for a 
bracket designed to hold 113.
