Subject: Re: Kombi definition w/insurance ?

a few opinions of my own...

no i am NOT a vintage nazi!

&gt; If Kombis were sold with optional headliners

dunno about that have never seen a gennie kombi w/ 
headliner, have other people?

 
&gt; 
&gt; Even having a pop-top that your insurers don't know about 
may cause you
&gt; problems as thats a structural modification (removes one 
of the cross
&gt; beams in the roof)

really depends on the year of the bus and the pop top on 
there. VW was much more obsessive about not cutting out roof 
members that were aftermarket companies FWIW. Look at a 
split window bus outfitted with a Dormobile roof versus a 
conventional Westfalia &quot;Turret&quot; Pop Top and you will know 
what I mean.

&gt; 
&gt; Be straight with them, then they won't have a chance to 
screw you.

That is something I I would like to see doesn't &quot;Insurance&quot; 
mean &quot;screw you&quot; in Latin er sumthing?? :p
