Hi Volks,

Jason Leigh &lt;jasonleigh_at_earthlink_dot_net&gt; wrote to the List about &quot;T4 
and Vanagon Frankenbus&quot;, but he's not the only one who makes this 
mistake here; still, his message triggered this one, which ought to 
be in the FAQ if I say so myself...


Brief message:

T DOES NOT MEAN TYPE.
T means &quot;Transporter&quot;.


Short explanation:

Type 1 - Bug, Super Beetle, Karmann Ghia, Fridolin, Thing
         [uses Type 1 engine]

Type 2 - Transporter, Bus, Camper
    T1 - Splitty (1st generation, 1950-67)
         [uses Type 1 engine]
    T2 - Bay(window) or (bread)loaf (2nd gen., 1968-79)
         [uses either Type 1 or Type 4 engine]
    T3 - Vanagon or Wedge (3rd gen., 1980-90 (92))
         [uses either Type 4 or watercooled engine]
    T4 - Eurovan (4th gen., 1991-today)
         [uses watercooled engine]

Type 3 - 1500/1600: notchback, fastback (TL), squareback (Variant), 
         Karmann Ghia

Type 4 - 411/412, fastback 2dr/4dr, squareback (Variant)


Longer explanation:

Aircooled Volkswagens are seperated into &quot;Types&quot;, which were numbered 
by the year of presentation.  The Bug was first, hence Type 1, and 
the Transporter naturally Type 2.  The Type 3 was essentially a 
re-bodied Bug, but with enough difference to warrant an own number.  
The Type 4, sold as the 411 and later 412, was all new, even its 
engine (though still an aircooled flat-four) was a new design.

Unlike any other rear-engined Volkswagen model, the Transporter saw 
several &quot;generations&quot;, re-incarnations of the same essential concept 
with little or no equal parts.  To help distinguish these with ease, 
Volkswagen decided to give them codes.  Unfortunately, they chose a 
code of &quot;T&quot; + generation number, making the 2nd generation the T2.  
That was in late 1967.

Now everybody had 12 years of time to effectively forget that T2 and 
Type 2 didn't mean the same, because almost all the Type 2s one saw 
were T2s as well.  Thus, when the T3 was introduced, the VW world 
fell into a confusion from which it hasn't yet quite recovered.  Even 
German VW dealers call the T3 the T2, and the T2 the T1, and the T1 
the Type 1, and the T2 the Type 2, or even the Type 1, at times.  But 
we as fans ought to do better!

Once and for all: ANY VW Transporter is a TYPE 2.  NONE of them are 
Type 1, Type 3, or Type 4.  They CAN be T1, T3, and T4 of course, or 
T2, which (together with the aircooled T3) is the topic of this list.

Deep breath.  We're halfway there.

To confuse us further, VW fitted the T2 with two different engines, 
which, from the cars they were first introduced in, were, logically, 
named the Type 1 engine and the Type 4 engine.  The latter was 
offered first in the T2 from 1972 on, mandantory in North America, 
optionally elsewhere, and presumably not at all somewhere.

The T3 got the Type 4 engine too, and an optional heavily modified 
Type 1 engine outside North America as well (which I happily ignored 
in the short explanation above).  Both were replaced by the 
&quot;wasserboxer&quot; watercooled flat-four, where ends the scope of this 
list.  (There also were Diesels and watercooled in-line gasoline 
engines, the latter for South African production.  There also were 
such engines in T2s out of Mexico, and possibly even in T1 and T1.5 
out of Brazil.  But I digress -- that's for sometime else.)

So, an '82 (German-built, US model) VW Transporter is a Type 2, T3, 
with a Type 4 engine.  It is not a T2.  It does not have a T4 engine 
(which would be something out of a Eurovan).  And it is not a Type 3. 
Nor is it a Type 4, it merely has a similar engine to one.

Help me battle the confusion everybody.  It's not that hard is it?

Now let's chant: 

T stands for Transporter
T does not stand for Type
T may be somewhat shorter
But that won't make it right

Everybody!  I can't hear ya!!!  ;-)))

Thank you.
    Erik.
