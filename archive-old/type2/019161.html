just my little input...
mine does the same thing sometimes...its the ignition switch in mine.  You have
to find that little *nitch* in the switch..and oddly enough mine changes
position with temperature... and its not the choke or anything else
misadjusted...i'm sure of this.  so try the ignition switch thing (run a hot
wire from the battery to coil and see if it runs then) that will tell you all
about your ignition switch...
