&gt; Ok,
&gt; 	Looks like its engine oil. Don't know if I should allow a sigh

&gt; keep going than if it were tranny oil.  So, from what I have read, I
&gt; most likely will still have to drop the engine.  After reading the
&gt; archive and such on this, I thought that I may actually be able to
&gt; handle this.  But, a few more sips of coffee tells me that I have hardly
&gt; any of the tools needed to do this.  And not enough money to go and buy
&gt; them.  Looks like the engine oil went down about a half a quart or less.
&gt; 	The list never fails to amaze me.  **questioning myselft--&gt;
&gt; &quot;Would bussers really be willing to spend their weekend at Everybus
&gt; helping me drop my engine?&quot;   This is truly amazing.  I would love to do
&gt; this, but almost feel bad about asking.  Please let me know if there is
&gt; a way that this could be done.  I really have no other option.  I would
&gt; be willing to spend any extra money I have to get tools if needed
&gt; (Granted that's not much $)  Also, what seal is it that I would need to
&gt; get?  Should I get other seals to replace while I am at it?  I can't
&gt; thank the list enough and truly appreciate what you have all done.

Heck, I thought that having a few participants drop their engines was a
required part of every VW bus event!
