Jon asked:


 Last night in an attempt to get my walkthrough heat working, I broke the
heater cable at the dash side.


 What is the part number and is it still available?

 I might be able to rig something up, but the funky looped back wire at the
end is going to be tricky.

 Specifics: This is the cable on my '78 Westy that opens/closes the flap
that redirects hot air to the rear passengers via the vents on the
walkthrough. It is controlled by the left dash lever.

Cable 2A here:  http://images.thesamba_dot_com/vw/gallery/pix/391125.gif

It is part number 221711605F and is 2515mm long. It fits from 2x6 2000 001
and up. It is still available from VW. This dealer has it in stock:
