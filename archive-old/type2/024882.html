ok, so on our new 72' adventure bus our brakes are terrible.  its not the
pads or shoes.  we thought it was just the power assist because it wasnt
hooked up. so we attached a hose with the one way valve  (trying both ways)
to the carb.  no luck. so in our attempt to replace it we notice its full of
break fluid and since it shouldnt have any in it we assume its our master
cylinder.  so now it has a new master cylinder and a used power assist and
our breaks have maybe improvesd 15% but we still have no breaking power at
all in the front it seams.  we are so confused, so HOPEFULLY one of ya'll
can give me some ideas..........Nonny
