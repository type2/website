Subject: fried ignition switch??

To the list -

Fried the black wire going to the ignition from the fuse box - replaced it
and all seems well when you first turn on the key - all the warning lights
come on, fuel gauge works, etc.... then when I turn the key, everything
cuts out - gas gauge goes down to nothing, no oil or battery
lights,etc....but the starter operates...though the engine doesn't even
cough - checked the coil, distributor, cap, plugs, gas in the carbs.....

Been so long since I started this thing, I can't remember if the dash
lights and fuel gauge switch off for a moment while the engine is
cranked...then come back on once it starts.....

Any ideas??? Is my ignition switch fried?? Or should I be looking else
where?

I started having problems, by the way, when the power wire going to the
switch for the back-up lights separated from a fuse holder and grounded
itself out against the engine block - cooking the wire all the way back to
the coil, where I was picking up power. Shortly after that, my dash lights
flickered, engine skipped a beat...then everything died. Prior to this,
everything worked great... in fact, the bus was my daily driver - 70 miles
everyday at highway speeds.
Since I replaced that black wire going to the ignition, everything seems to
work until I turn the key.

Any help appreciated.
