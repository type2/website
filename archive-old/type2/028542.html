&gt;I have a question regarding the front mount....will that harm the bus? Did
the Spare ever come mounted up there from  Factory?

There was an interesting posting on front mounted tires sometime last year -
probably in July - I don't know it that would be in the archives or not. A
member from Europe posted on the front mounting spares, detailing some
issues with them, local regs in Europe, etc. It had a lot of info on the
issue though.

Peace
