Battery draining?  Like if it sits for 3 days, battery is drained? Or you
run the car for a few hrs and it won't start later?  For former, it's
2 possible reasons- it can't hold charge, or you have a continuous short
which is drawing it down.  Check resting voltage- a working battery should
be at least 12 volts if you PULL one of the terminals after a recharge.
If battery is draining and you don't have a voltmeter, try pulling the (+)
terminal and then AT NIGHT touch it to the post- do you see a little spark?
An electric clock should be disconnected first.  The bigger the spark,
bigger the draw.   When bus is in a starting state, pull terminal and wait
a few days- does it start now? Yes- suggests short. No- bad battery.
If you have an ammeter, connect it between battery and post and see if
there is a reading at all when you connect to post (means short).  A
digital voltmeter can give you a clue- connect it across the posts, check
the reading when terminal on one side is pulled-then reconnect post and see
if it drops- will be more obvious the bigger the draw.  Other reasons for
battery appearing to drain is poor charging system while things are on
drawing current- with voltmeter connected across terminals (or to any (+)
GOING RIGHT TO BATTERY (you can find one at fuse box, or use cigarette
lighter socket if you have one) and to ground- check resting voltage- lets
say it's 11-12 volts.  Then start car, check voltage- should be over 13 if
charging is working, and should be over 12 if you turn on lights, wipers-
shows if regulator is keeping up.  Usually if battery is poor (under 12
volts resting) it should try to charge at 13.5 to 13.8 volts.  The Bentley
manual or the idiot book shows how to check output of generator/alternator
directly- the hidden terminals (both regulator and alternator) on my 78
Westy makes that tough.  Mostly I replace regulator first with known good
one, then check voltage before suspecting alternator.
   If you have a drain that = short, look for wires rubbing to ground that
don't go thru fuses, or dirty battery top, or dirty/damp starter terminals.
Claiming connections are old (corroded) would LIMIT current use, not
INCREASE it, easily tested with voltmeter or ammeter- although such
connections will also limit battery's ability to charge, which is why I
clean connections to starter FIRST till they shine!  Same with old fuses-
are those fuse tips shiny metal or green? Clean them.  Also clean those
holes fuses sit in- break off the tip of a 1/4&quot; drill bit, twirl it in the
hole to clean it.  Same with push terminals- is the flat part clean, and
the female part crimping on tight? (Does it slide off easy, or hard?  Grind
a thin nail file so it has same profile as plat connector end, slip the
pushonconnector over it.  Same with bulb connections- clean them, coat with
dialectric grease to discourage more corrosion.  Good luck!   MB
