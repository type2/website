Subject: timing issues

The question is ... could a dist that doesn't advance far enough create problems
with the engine

I worked on a 1600 DP engine, ,, I don't know the pulley is correct, etc. so we
started from scratch, marked tdc, and 5 deg Atdc,, and also 32 deg Btdc

with the valves adjusted, and the dwell set to 50 deg, the engine liked to start
with the initial timing set at 5deg atdc
the dist only advances to about 1/2 way from tdc to the 32Btdc mark,, so, I am
guessing about 15 deg Btdc total advance is possible

I tried to move the total advance closer to 30btdc, but that starts to make the
initial advance move to BTDC , which will make starting harder

I suggested that the owner get another dist, but for other reasons, he just
wants to drive it,,

So, I have been wondering if running the engine at 3 -4k rpm with 15btdc advance
will cause any concerns..
