well of course you could buy them at a marine supply store,
and they are usually avaliable from larger battery supply outlets they are
classed differently than an auto battery usually with an &quot;N&quot; in the code.

BUT 

personally I prefer the newer &quot;Starved Electrolyte&quot; batteries, these are
used in the UPS power supplies used in backing up computer systems, and
some of the high end power wheelchairs.  These batteries are more
expensive but last longer and are built for REALLY tough service and long
periods of holding a charge without a lot of use.  (I use size 24NP12)
avoid the Panasonic batteries I have had a lot of trouble with these.  two
of the 24NP12 batteries in parallel. willl last a lot longer than the
biggest marine battery that I previously used and take up less space and
are lighter (but cost twice as much, TANSTAAFL)

keep deep cycle batteries charged and about once a month totally discharge
the batteries and recharge them fully.  it is easy leave a light or
something turned on until the batteries are fully discharged then recharge
them....Also remember that a standard auto battery charger will not fully
or properly charge a deep cycle battery, and a gel cell battery needs a
special charger made only for gel cell batteries which are charged very
differently. 

YMMV
