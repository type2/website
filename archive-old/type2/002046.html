Subject: Transmission Replacement Advice

Looking for some list wisdom on a tranny replacement. I blew out my 2nd gear
syncro come down Pikes Peak on the Motorworks Rally last year. It's getting
steadily worse and is leak tranny oil all over my engine (which dosen't leak
a drop ;).

So I figured I might buy a replacement from Motorworks. Has anyone had
experience with their transmissions or aptly their transmission supplier?
Should I be looking elsewere?

I am going to keep the stock ratios. I thought about lowering them for
mountain climbing in Colorado, but I do enough cross-country to make top end
a consideration. Besides, I own a Bus. I'm not in a hurry :)

Thanks,
Chris
