Subject: master cyclinder &amp; brake bleeding update

   Hello all, thanks for the many suggestions on how to remove air from 
master cylinder.  I went with the submerge cylinder and reservoir in bucket 
of brake fluid route and then push cylinder with dowle till bubbles stopped.  
After that I had no problems at all adjusting and bleeding brakes.  Now the 
brakes on my 70 bus feel like my 97 subaru.  What is the cleaning agent of 
choice when trying to clean up headliner?  Marcus
