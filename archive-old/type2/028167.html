Hello listmembers,

My addiction has officially gotten the better of me and I may be picking up 
another bus. This one is a 76, and the details I know so far are this :

Its been sitting for three years, the CO (current owner) changed the oil and 
was able to start it right up.
It will not go into gear now, but it was able to fine when it was last used 
- he thinks its just something with the clutch cable...
imported german 2litre with hydraulic lifters with 20,000 miles on it so 
far.
It doesn't leak (no water coming into it) although has the standard dings 
and dents here and there. Full interior, sink,cabinets, poptop.


What are my main concerns with buying a bus that has been sitting for this 
long?


Im driving up there on saturday morning to take a look at it, anything I 
should check while im there that a tire-kickin wouldn't tell me?


lookin to add one to the family,
Christopher
75 transporter
