Subject: Re: westy Floor question

Gary,

This does not sound like the original floor to me.  On a '75 I stripped a
while back, with what seemed to be the original floor, the construction
was: 4 pieces of ~3/8&quot; fiberboard cut to fit the recessed area of the
floor (the corrugated section), but not the door edge.  This was covered
by a piece of 1/8&quot; masonite.  Over the masonite was a sheet of plastic and
vinyl flooring.  The masonite and vinyl had some ~3/4&quot; oval head sheet
metal screws at the door, but was otherwise held in place by the
cabinetry.  I *think* this was original, but (a) maybe not and (b)
different years may have had different construction techniques.

In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. 
But, in practice, there is.
