Subject: FI issue &quot;solved&quot; what it was...

I gotta say, this one nearly got me...but in the end, I figured it out..

Symptom:
Middle of last week, I went to work (leaving early to avoid the traffic)
in the bus.._dot_mild day, and the exhaust on the &quot;winter beater&quot; needed
replacing, so I took the &quot;Sundancer&quot; for a last run before winter
hits...

Warmed it up for a couple minutes, then had it caugh and stall as I
started to move away...started right up, and stalled again as I
approached the first stop sign...It occasionally caughs, but never
stalls, so this was strange....restarted after two tries, and up the
road about 3 miles to the next stop, where it died again as I pressed
the gas to leave, and wouldn't restart...hitchiked home...picture
it...older guy with daytimer and coffee in hand trying to hitch a ride
at 7AM.....not a pretty sight
Symptom: cranks over 6-8 times, does one VROOM, and dies....after that,
no amount of cranking over will start it...
- gas smell through the exhaust after cranking(got gas)
- Changed the fuel filter
- good strong spark(got spark)
- moving the AFM with the ignition on, makes the fuel pump work
- timing and plug connections are correct to the plugs
- valves are correctly lashed


Testing, Testing..
Spoke to a friend Karl....we all know Karl, (gotta meet him some day,
and take him out to dinner or something) he confirmed my suspicions, and
I worked through testing on the double relay first, then the AFM, then
swaped the brain....no change in the symptom...
Then everything died completely...this after 4 hours of fiddling with
it...I was dumbfounded, and went inside for a soda....things were
getting worse instead of better.
Later, I went back out, and started tracing power to the dash..battery
cable was good to the starter, but there didn't seem to be any power
getting through, so I pulled, and sandpapered the connections on the
starter, greased, and re-installed them..still nothing...went back to
the battery for a ground, and suddenly had power to the starter....It
wasn't a power problem at all, but a ground cable that had lost
continuity at the crimp where it attaches to the body..replaced the
ground cable and everything but the engine came back to life...

Decided dreamland was the place to figure it out, and went back inside
to watch the Leafs win another one...

Ouala it came to me in my dreams...

Figuring one ground might have been two, I checked the two harness
ground connections under the center chamber on the case, and one had
become disconnected....hooked it back up, and my baby came back to
life...

Gonna take her for a nice Sunday drive this afternoon for
thanks....gotta love the Karma happening here...guess all she needed was
a little attention is all...hadn't done much with her since we got back
from Nashville in September.

BTW...if any of you have a chance to put in a Vanagon electronic
dizzy/coil setup(Karl found one for me,but he says they're getting hard
to find) do it...start-up and idle is improved 100% over any stock
points dizzy I've ever used...

Thanks for letting me ramble....maybe someone else will learn from my
experience.

Good bussing all....
