&gt; I think I solved the alternator/regulator problem. It was the regulator. Replaced that and *THAT* problem has been replaced with a new one.
&gt; 
&gt; I cranked her over a little (coil wire off; no gas) and could still smell something, though the alternator/regulator wires weren't warm at all. So I had my wife crank her over for me and a bunch of smoke came up from underneath. I had her stop and I crawled under as quickly as possible. Feeling around on every wire, but all were cool. Then I happened to touch the clutch cable tube. Yowsa! That puppy was as hot as an electric eel. I could see that what was happening was that the grease inside thi
&gt; 
&gt; Other interesting symptoms:
&gt; 
&gt; I have continuity (about 50% on my ohm meter) between my positive battery cable and the chassis of the bus. When I remove the big cable from the alternator (at the starter); I no longer have this problem. I just inspected the cable today and it's not broken. This is the alternator I had tested this morning and it works fine. I have the continuity with or without the plug into the voltage regulator...and regardless of what other wires are connected or disconnected.
&gt; 
&gt; I thought this meant that I had a dead short in my alternator, but I don't think it would have passed the alternator test on the test stand if that were true.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm really stumped on this one. Any ideas, theoretical or practical would be appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks! Joe
Joe:
Your ground cable on the transmission nose to frame is either
disconnected or non-funtional. The return current is seeking any means
possible and the one it found is the clutch tube (not as good as a
copper cable).
I noticed you mentioned that the coil wire is disconnected. You should
not disconnect the coil wire without grounding it- it could cause the
voltage to build up and damage the coil. A better plan is to pull the
points-to-coil wire from the distributor. This wire is never hot (the
points just ground it), so you don't have to be vey careful to insulate
it.
