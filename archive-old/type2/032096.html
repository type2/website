Subject: Re:[T2] Backwards dist. drive (was: George Lyle--He de man.)

&gt; If this is true, then if the distributor drive is 180 degrees off, as

&gt; This would seem like a good reason to rotate the drive rather than move
&gt; the plug wires.  My camper's previous owner installed the drive backward
&gt; so the first thing I ever did to an acvw was pop out the drive.

Could you please describe how one does this (gets the distributor drive in
backwards), and how one recognizes the condition? I did this once while
rebuilding my '78 Westy's engine 7 years ago, but I've forgotten what I
did and what it looked like. Since then I've had this vague dread about
removing my distributor for any reason (lest I do it again), but I'd like
to do it now. A little refresher discussion of this problem would really
help me.

I recall that hand cranking the engine and looking at the order of valves
lifting (back and forth under the bus and behind the bus, through a
whole compression and exhaust cycle and thinking about it) convinced me
that it was a problem. That and the bus wouldn't start, of course. I think
it was something to do with the TDC indicator tic on the fan coming around
twice in every cycle and getting it on the wrong one before I dropped the
distributor drive in.

Please remind me, since it seems fresh in your memory?
