Subject: Busted Bus: Revived

I headed down to Busted Bus on Saturday to meet Chris and see if I could
find some of those rare gems to finish off my 68 DC. Well I found everything
on my list thanks to Chris spending an hour after closing time with me
digging through BB's large (and &quot;organized&quot;) inventory. He is getting a hold
on the tagging and bagging part. I'm impressed.

Even though emails take a bit to get answered, Chris is a stand-up guy
running a big one-man-show.

Kudos Chris and thanks again for putting the fix back in Busted Bus.
