Hi Teri

I measured the trans I have here, they are very close to 13mm hole OD for the bushing.
If you have a 1/2&quot; drill bit, you can slide it in the trans hole to see how much
play there is. When I tried a 1/2&quot; bit, there was very very little play.

If yours is larger than that,, I dunno what ,, maybe someone has made a oversized
bushing.

Something like the 6v trans with the 12v starter bushing.

You could always use a SR17 automatic starter and forget all about that bushing.
