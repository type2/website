Subject: [T2] [ADMIN] Dialsprint Connections Blacklisted

Volks,

Due to a net-wide spam barrage of near-Biblical proportions, this weekend
we will begin blocking all mail that bears any trace of having come through
a dialsprint_dot_net modem connection. This block will endure until dialsprint
cleans up their act, or is entered in the Realtime Blackhole List,
whichever comes first,but neither of which is likely.

Dialsprint sells dialups to Earthlink, and if you are an Earthlink
subscriber this could affect you if something goes wrong.

The filter should be smart enough to let through mail addressed directly to
the type2 list and the vintagebus list, along with the type2-admin and
vintagebus-admin addresses. Nobody should lose any access to the lists
because of this. As long as I write it correctly. =^ )

If you are an Earthlink customer and you think your mail is not getting
through next week, please let me know at this address:
&lt;bighouse_at_bellsouth_dot_net&gt;. You'll get through there because Bellsouth does
not block dialsprint connections nor any other spammers at all. Ask me how
I know. =^ \
