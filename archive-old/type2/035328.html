&gt;   I know there is lots of talk about the CHT accuracy especially when you

Brad,
What kind of wire did you use in your extension?  Does your gauge allow
extensions? or is it one of those that say in the instructions DO NOT CUT OR
EXTEND THE SENSOR WIRES.  I ask this for a very specific reason, thermocouple
wires if not extended properly will add in an ERROR voltage that is
proportional to the temperature at your extension junction.  This would result
in your gauge reading too LOW.  Now since you 'calibrated' it against your
candy thermometer and have determined that it is reading 50 degrees too high, I
would be very suspect of those readings.

One way you can test this is to go back to the test method that you used and
try the following,
1. while you are comparing candy thermometer vs. CHT gauge, heat the extension
junction up with a hair dryer, note if the CHT gauge temperature drops (or
rises)
2. while you are comparing candy thermometer vs. CHT gauge, drop the extension
junction into a bath of ice water and note if the CHT gauge temperature rises
(or drops)

If you did both tests 1 and 2 and the CHT gauge did not change at all, then you
should be fairly safe with your assumption.  If the CHT changes at all, your
'calibration' is about as valuable as a 3 dollar bill.

Since you are subtracting temps from your reading, it would be good to run this
test so you don't get a false sense of security (Thinking you're at 450 when
the heads are really 500).

Feel free to holler it you have any troubles.

Scott
