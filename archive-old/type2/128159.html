Subject: 500 miles

Hi volks,

Did a 500 mile round trip (or so) in my 74 recently.

Morehead, Ky to Beanblossom, IN :
www.beanblossomblues_dot_com 

I was the only transporter there and got many
conversations and compliments on my beat up old bus.
Walter Trout kicks ass, BTW.

Just wanted to say hey and that this was the longest
trip I've made since my rebuild in 99 - which I
wouldn't have been able to do without this list.
Pretty cool to be tooling down I65 at 75 MPH thinking
&quot;I BUILT this thing.&quot;

Thanks,
Clark
