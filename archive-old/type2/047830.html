None that I can think of, but there must be one, eh?  Else why would so
many &quot;westy parts for sale&quot; and/or &quot;westy oil temps advice&quot; etc. ad
nauseum posts have nothing to do with the camping equipment?

'Twas sarcasm, folks.  I'm hoping that when a post specifies a Westy, it
has SOMETHING to do with camping or camping equipment -- and (I know
this is going out on a limb) NOTHING to do with Adventurewagens,
Dormobiles, etc.
