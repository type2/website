&gt; I have a 79 with a stock engine. I need to put a new muffler on it and

&gt; what years. I looked in some parts catalogs, but just wanted to be positive 
&gt; I had it right. Does anyone have an extra one of these mufflers?

My 79 already had the older style muffler attached so it works great.
It's the 72-74 style muffler that will bolt straight up. More info
