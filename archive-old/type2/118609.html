Subject: Split bus deluxe coat hooks

I am trying to sell some coat hooks that I thought were for all deluxe model
split busses. I have a potential buyer who is wanting to know if these are the
correct ones for his '65 21 window. Being a bay window guy I'm not sure if
these are the right ones for his year. Can anyone tell me? I'm not on the
vintage list or I would ask there. Here is the link to the ad

Thanks all
