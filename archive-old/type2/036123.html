Subject: &lt;F&gt; What's in a Name?

So, my wife sez &quot;What the heck does &quot;Itch&quot; stand for&quot;?

So I sez &quot;It could either mean that I've had an &quot;Itch&quot; for a bus&quot; (hence,
the name &quot;Itch&quot;), or it could mean &quot;A nagging little thing that needs
constant attention, and takes your mind off of other, more important things
until you satisfy it&quot; (hence, the name &quot;Itch&quot;).

So SHE sez &quot;Well, what other names do the people on that &quot;list thingy&quot; have
for their vans&quot;?

So I corrected &quot;Busses? You mean Busses?&quot; (she has a T*y*t* Van).

So she gives me this steely-eyed leer of a scorned woman not about to accept
the fact she screwed up the lingo, and she's NOT going to answer my somewhat
smart-azzed rhetorical question.

So I smiles, took a deep breath and spewed:
