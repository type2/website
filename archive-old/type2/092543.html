Subject: Re: [T2] Diesel bay?

This started as a !free! diesel jetta.  Having the engine is 30% of the=20
hassle.  The other 70 is the usual time/money equation.  I am certainly up=
=20
to the necessary fabrication and can spina good wrench if you put a good=20
one in my hand.  I'm not particularly fond of the T4 engine, and feel that=
=20
the diesel is the less of the 2 evils.  If I was going for power I'd go=20
with a V-6.

Besides - the Award Winning Burrito Express is, and always will be, an=20
experiment (unless you want to buy it).

Chris - I'm picking it up today, will have the VIN for you.  It'll be=20
passed on after I pick thru it so your buddy can get what he needs.

BTW Tom, I'm sorry we couldn't hook up while you were on tour.

&gt;What about a Type 4 conversion, like the ones they are putting in Ghias and
&gt;Bugs, would'nt these work on the &quot;Bug motored&quot; Bays? I thinka 2000cc
&gt;conversion would give you plenty of power.
