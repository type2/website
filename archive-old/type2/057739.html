Subject: RE: bugs in busses

&gt;&gt;You'd be surprised what sorts of electrical conductivity a spider
&gt;&gt;can produce in there.

&gt;You know, that's an interesting idea!  I did notice a bunch of ants
&gt;crawling on my handbrake lever the same morning it wouldn't start.

I don't know about other states, but this reminds me of a real problem some
Texans have had - including me.
We have a weird little ant (native, less-stingy fireant I think) that LOVES
to nest up under the headliners, or behind the birch panels in westies,
etc. I've taken apart a bus that must've weighed 500 extra pounds in ant.

Not very ecofriendly, but I recommend seting off a can off bugkiller in the
van once a year. Disconnect the battery first!
