Subject: Re: [T2] 75 Fuel Injection on a 78 engine?

[...]


&gt; Some time ago I purchaced a dead 1975 bus with a poorly rebuilt 1976
&gt; 2000cc F.I. engine that had dropped a valve guide into the combustion
&gt; chamber. Tore it down for a rebuild and found the engine has two
&gt; different heads (different size valves and ports) and some other un-cool
&gt; things. I picked up a 1978 2000cc to replace the '76 with, but couldn't
&gt; get the control unit or the AFC for the 78. I did get everything else
&gt; involving the F.I. for the 78.
&gt;
&gt; The 76 engine has the complete F.I. from the 1975 1800 including the ECU
&gt; and AFC.
&gt;
&gt; My question is, can I use the 1975 ECU and AFC with all the 1978 parts
&gt; or should I move all the 1975 F.I. parts to the 78 engine? What are the
&gt; differences between these ecu and afc's? I know in an ideal world I
&gt; should get the 78 ecu and afc but with all these working parts and a dry
&gt; wallet I must make due with what I have for now. If the 75 and 78 parts
&gt; will mix ok for now, I hope to get the 78 ecu and afc later, but I have
&gt; to get this bus on the road before my other transportation dies.

By 'AFC' I assume you mean Air Flow Meter [AFM]? If yes, then the 75 AFM
should be part # 0 280 200 012 which fits 74 Cal 1800 auto trans, 75, and 76
up to 12/75. This is a 6 pin AFM. It does not have a temp sensor in it. AFM
# 0 280 200 018 fits 76-77. # 0 280 200 020 fits 78 and Fed version 79. The
018 and 020 are 7 pin AFM's and has a temp sensor in them. The 018 subs to
the 020 and are interchangeable.
You need to count the pin terminals in your AFM plug. If your 78 harness has
7 pins, then you cannot use the 75 FI stuff.
[ you said your 76 is using the 75 parts, this is possible if the 76 was
built before 12/75. If it was built after 1/76, then someone has put on ALL
the 75 parts, harness and all.
Did they also put on the 75 EGR valve? 76 and up is all mechanical.....]
