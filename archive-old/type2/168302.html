&gt; I finally got the front seats back from Colorado Seat Treat.  John did a
&gt; real nice job.  The fabric came from Wolfsburg West.  They used foam in
&gt; instead of the new horsehair type stuff that is available.  They turned
&gt; out very nice.  There is one small area where the stuffing is exposed on
&gt; each one though.  I'm not sure what to do about that if anything.

The greatest single cause of atheism in the world today is Christians, who
acknowledge Jesus with their lips and walk out the door, and deny Him by
their lifestyle. That is what an unbelieving world simply finds
unbelievable.
