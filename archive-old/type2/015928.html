Subject: String in the Permatex.
Message-Id: &lt;3.0.6.32.19990611231943.007bbbb0_at_mail.ikansas_dot_com&gt;

&gt;Greetings to you all,
&gt;   This weekend I hope to assemble the bottom end of my stock 2 liter 
&gt;engine.  I'm planning on using Permatex Aviation Form A Gasket on the 
&gt;split-line, but I've got the &quot; thread in the sealant &quot; method on my mind.  
&gt;Have any of you ever done this, and what where your experiences ?  I know 
&gt;that method is used on aircraft engines, but there it is expected.  What 
&gt;good is it to measure bearing journals to the ten thousandths and then do 
&gt;something that will have a measurable, even if small, effect?

Paul - As an A&amp;P mechanic, I've done this a few times. Frankly, I don't
have all that much experience in engine overhaul, and I don't have a manual
handy, but here goes. First, you use the Permatex you mentioned, and a (I'm
dredging this up from DEEP memory) &quot;00&quot; silk thread. The procedure goes
something like this:

1) Clean everything carefully. This method will only work with perfectly
clean flanges. When cleaning, ensure that you're using a scraper that's
softer than the flange, too...scratch the flanges up and you're done.

2) Put down a small layer of Permatex, and smear to cover flanges evenly
with a finger. This is not a case of more is better. Put on too much, and
the SOB will leak forever. Try not to get much into the
case-half-bolt-holes. You know you've got the right thickness of permatex
when it looks like you've just colored the surface, but can still see the
surface through the permatex.

3) Let the permatex get a little tacky (5-10 minutes? It's been a WHILE),
then carefully lay down the thread on one flange. Use a double thread,
(i.e. two different threads or lay it in once , then bring it back through)
and ensure that they NEVER cross over each other. That, too, will make it
leak. Ensure that the string doesn't interfere with the bolt-holes, btw. I
usually try to put both layers on the inside of the holes all the way around.

4) Assemble the engine and tighten the case half bolts to the spec torque.

5) Take a sharp knife and trim the string off flush where it comes out of
the case parting surface.

6) Let sit for 24 hours before introducing fluids (oil, specifically) to
the crankcase.

When this is done right, it won't leak in a standard overhaul period.

Now - big disclaimers are in order here. I haven't done this in a while
(uhhh...last September?), and I'm not looking at a manual, and (MOST
IMPORTANT) this is the procedure for a Lycoming (I think it was a
O-320-A4K, last) not a VW. Your Milage WILL vary. I've never torn a VW
apart, (I'm a wannabusser right now), and I don't know what kind of
standards they had for those surfaces.
Forinstance, in an aircraft engine (with a few exceptions), the case halves
are cast as a unit. Cannot be individually replaced. I dunno this about VW's.

Can anybody else comment?

Regards,

&quot;Fraser, there's a guy on my corner who asks me every morning if I've
seen God; do you really think he expects me to point Him out?&quot;
&quot;Well you know, Ray, if you did, perhaps he'd stop asking.&quot;
