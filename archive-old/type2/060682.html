Subject: Re: RE: BUS / VANAGON Tires (Tyres?)

Hi volks,

&gt; I received a phone call this afternoon from a Michelin &quot;Sales Engineer&quot;, 

 A sales engineer, huh? Now there's a job title...

&gt;... this tire is 
&gt; available only by &quot;special order&quot;.  ...
&gt;...  He wasn't familiar with our specific requirements, and was 
&gt; surprised to learn that even late production Vanagons needed a reinforced tire 
&gt; in the 185R14 size. ...

 This is ridicuous! There must be tens of thousands of vans rolling around Europe (let alone the rest of the world) on 185R14Cs- they are so common that I've seen them listed on the front page of those freebie Used Car weekly newspapers in ads from tyre sellers advertising cheap tyres in common sizes!!
 There are dozens of different models of tyre from many manufacturers available in this size and the tyre market is about as international as any.
 Sheesh! Only in America....

Cheers,
              W.
