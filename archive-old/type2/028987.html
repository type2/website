Markus:  There is a whole lot of stuff in your system which is no longer
available.

Consider replacing the whole system with the heat exchangers and muffler
from the 72-74 or 79-83 Type 2.  These had exhaust manifolds integrated with
the heat exchangers.

If your heat exchangers are not in great shape, you end up with fresh heat
exchangers in the process.

Consider that the &quot;U&quot; tube that connexts your exchangers to the manifolds
are no longer available, and if the metal on the flange is wearing thin, its
going to go soon too.  A little money spend on the other type of heater
boxes could solve your current problem, and avoid future troubles too.  Of
course, you may need to replace some sheet metal in the cooling system under
there, and there may be differences with the sheet metal heat risers going
to the flap boxes, and I'm not sure how the 72-74 boxes hook up with the
alloy cooling shoud.  If anyone knows, I'd be pleased to find out.

Hello all, I wrote a while back, but I'm gonna try again.  I am looking for
the piece of the heat exchanger that bolts to the head, like an exhaust
manifold.  I don't need the whole heat exchanger, just the foot or so long
piece that bolts to the head and combines the exhaust from #3 and #4 into
one.  Mine is cracked, and I am having trouble finding one.  It has a thin
heat-shield over it which I do not care about the condition of (or if the
heat shield is there at all).  I have a 77 westy with a 2.0L.  It needs to
be from the drivers (#3, #4) side, as the flange to bolt it to the rest of
the heat exchanger is different.

I will pay for it of course, and if your not in the area for shipping.
Basically I am desperate.

Does anybody know a VW junkyard in washington state?

Thanks,

Marcus
