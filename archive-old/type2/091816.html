&gt;Hi everyone
&gt;I've been having problems with the fuel gauge on my 74 Westy.  The sending
&gt;unit seems to be fine but I could be wrong.  It works when I fill up with
&gt;gas but after I've gone about 15 miles it drops to empty.  Any ideas?

Hi Tara -

Sounds like the sender to me and here's why:

The tank sender on 73=BD-79 Buses is similar (but not the same) as the Super
Beetle in that it is a &quot;lever action&quot; sender with a little float ball (or
tube) on one end and a &quot;wiping&quot; device on the other end.  This wiping
device &quot;wipes&quot; over a strand of very fine wires in the sender housing that
provides what's called &quot;resistance&quot; in the electricity.  This resistance is
the signal that the sender &quot;sends&quot; to the gauge on your dash.

Now what happens over a period of time (28 years if you have the original
sender) is that this wiping action wears down those fine wires and they
either break or have no contact with the &quot;wiper&quot; in certain areas,
especially if previous owners always ran the tank at 3/4, 1/2 or 1/4 95% of
the time.  Sounds like the fine wires are OK on one section of the wiping
area (when the tank is full) and bad along the rest of it.

Call Ronnie (928-680-7664) and order up PN 211 919 051B Sender and replace=
 it.
