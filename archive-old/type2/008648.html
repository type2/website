All,


Gee....could it be AMSOIL? Y'know, from that get-rich-quick (NOT)
company called Amway????????

B.S. company, but good oil. Still, I don't think I'd want those Yahoos
having my adress. They're somewhat akin to a religious cult!!!!!!!

&gt;  Probably Royal Purple - am I right?  RP is good oil, maybe better
than
&gt;  Mobil 1 but you can't buy it at any Wal Mart while you're on a
&gt;  cross-country trip. &gt;&gt;
