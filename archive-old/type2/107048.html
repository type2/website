Subject: unpadding dash

I've seen some powdercoating textures that almost identically match the 
original look of the dash only you wouldn't have the padding. I doubt that that 
amount of padding would do anything for you anyway and by the time you reach 
the dash the steering wheel has already separated your body into two pieces.
