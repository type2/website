Subject: type 1 in a 74

So ... what's the story on euro spec (and SA) buses.  If they all had a type 1
engine then surely the engine tin from those buses would be available to put a
type 1 motor in a late bay bus - no?  In fact, shouldn't new engine tin for
putting a type 1 motor into a late bay bus be available from Brazil?  Of
course I'm assuming that the engine bay of a NA spec bus and a South American
bus are identical - are they?

I thought that I heard that there was someone making engine tin for a type 1
motor in a late bay bus - is that true?  If so - who is it?

TIA

1 motor)
