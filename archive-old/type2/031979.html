Hi Volks,

Arrrggghhh!!! My engine (2.0L 1978 westfalia, auto tranny) is back in with
new C&amp;Ps and... I've got an icky oil leak from my oilpump. :-( I may have
had it before- my other even ickier oil leak (now fixed, he said with as
much confidence as he could muster) may have been masking this oil leak.
At least my dipstick tube boot is now dry. Retorquing the bolts (just
barely possible in situ, with various thin and curvey -handled wrenches)
doesn't get it.  So it's coming back out, since I can't quite remove and
replace the thing with the engine in place. grumblegrumblegrumble... 

Mechanic I'm working with says he's only seen three oil pump leaks in 
many hundreds of 2.0L engines. Just lucky, I guess. 

I guess we'll carefully sand and buff up the sealing surfaces, replace the 
o-ring and gasket, put it back together and try it again. I wish we could 
fire it up on the bench, but with an auto tranny this is not very 
practical. So... Do a careful job, put it back in, and cross our fingers. 
In the meantime I'll keep it out of my mother in law's driveway. :-^

Anyone out there in type2land ever experience a leaky oil pump?

Oh BTW, the last and best word on hoses to an external auxillary oil
cooler: Order should not significantly affect oil pressure (though now
I've got an oil pressure gauge and am in a position to collect real data
if I want to), so put oil filter before the oil pump, to keep the oil pump
clean inside. 

Drive safely,
