Subject: Smog and EGR [passed]More Advice

Mr. Enlightened one,

Too bad we have all the good volkswagens!

Bwaaahaaahaahahaa!

Much as you wanna gripe about it, I'm glad for the smog laws because me and my kids live now in some of the worst air in this country. And I'm not in L.A. Perhaps I'll move to N.C.

p.s.: What exactly is &quot;ich'in&quot;?

p.p.s: Try tofu tacos. They're good.

&gt;Robb, who is happy as hell to live in NC.
