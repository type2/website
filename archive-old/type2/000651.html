I have read many, many times that folks on the list use and recommend Bus
Depot. My experience with them, though limited, has not been great.  I was
referred to them by many people and told to &quot;talk to Ron.&quot; After a few calls
and attempts, I got &quot;Ron&quot; for a minute- only long enough for him to figure
out I was ordering something and then I was connected to an &quot;order-taker.&quot;
Well, the $500 worth of parts I ordered last week was supposed to get to me
2 days ago-I offered to pay extra for quick delivery and was told UPS was
nearly as fast and much cheaper. So I call today and find nothing was
shipped!  They are waiting on a couple parts to come in. I wont make the VW
show in 2 days for lack of an exhaust/heater boxes. I took all week off work
to install my new motor and get her running...you see where this is
g:(    Next week when I have to work 70 hours to catch-up, I dont know what
I'll be driving either.
The point?   I am not usually one who orders a part based on price--I like
reputation.  I hate to write Bus Depot off based on the initial &quot;bad taste,&quot;
but I have NEVER had anything negative to say about RMMW or Wolfsburg West,
and I have had GREAT service and advice from AVP.  Once again, its worth it
to pay for quality--both parts AND service!
This may offend some of you, but this list is about info, right? This needs
to be out there as well as all the &quot;good press&quot;.Hope I don't lose any
friends.
