Subject: Swapped alternator, lost parts

In my 74 w/ 2L, I finally swapped my alternator that had an internal
short.  In the process of doing that, I lost the little plug thing that
covers the alternator tightening bolt, I lost the fancy alternator
tightening nut, and I lost the grommet that seals the dipstick through the
tin.  I also lost several engine tin Bolts.

It was our little australian shepard puppy Fiona that strew this stuff
around when I went in to go to the bathroom.

I looked at both the Bus Depot and CIP, but, I guess I was not searching
for the right words to get any results.

Can anybody help me with the parts numbers and/or links to any vendor?

Thanks,

Mark
