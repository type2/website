&gt;&gt;But in a gas motor, if you change the oil and 500 miles later the oil is
&gt;&gt;black, it is due to the fresh detergents dissolving the varnish that has

&gt;&gt;overloading the detergents for more varnish buildup during the next

&gt;
&gt;Interesting.  I'll admit I hadn't thought of that.

I resemble that remark several times every week due to this list and
others. The more I know, the more I know what I don't know far exceeds my
comprehension and/or experience.

&gt;&gt;In a clean motor of adequate lubrication service interval, the insides will
&gt;&gt;be as clean as the day it was assembled regardless the milage and the oil
&gt;&gt;will stay clean throughout its acceptable use interval.
&gt;
&gt;Here again I have to disagree.  Although my brain tells me you should be
&gt;correct, all of my experience tells me otherwise. 

Expand your experiance. 

The quality of off the self brand name carbon based motor oil is several
magnatudes a better lubricant than it was 20 years ago. That along with
less combustion gas contamination from cleaner running motors accounts for
a longer acceptable interval.  In all cases or types of use the appropriate
interval is determined by inspection. Takes one minute once you get the
feel for it from the following two minute experiment. 
 
&gt;&gt;Compare the feel of
&gt;&gt;your black oil to the feel of fresh oil. If you can feel grittiness, so can
&gt;&gt;your bearings, rings, cam lobes, oil pump...... Do you accept that the feel
&gt;&gt;of the oil can provide empirical evidence?? Try it.
&gt;
&gt;I cannot be certain that I feel grittiness, but then I don't think that my
&gt;fingers are sensitive enough to tell the grit from the imperfections in my
&gt;skin.  

Suprize yourself with the incredible sensitivity of the organic digit. Get
some pumice powder at the local cleaning supplies shelf. Using clean digits
and clean oil, rub with index digit and thumb digit. Can you say,
&quot;SMOOOOOOTH&quot;?? Now pick up a tad of pumice with the index digit and rub
some more. Consider the mini micron nature of pumice powder and be amazed
at your sensitivity. Now clean your digits and pick up a drop of oil from
the dip stick. Draw your own conclusions. 

I say that if you can feel the grit, the detergent package is over loaded
because if all the grit was encompassed by the detergent if would feel much
like the fresh oil. The detergents are there so the bearings and such do
not 'feel' these agents of wear curve enhancement. 

Consider the atomic level of the interface of bearing and journal. Pumice
is like boulders on that level, no less than the chunks of hard carbon
falling off the build up of hard and flaky carbon baked a 1/2&quot; thick under
the piston head in the typical excessive lube interval motor. That's
pistons no longer being cooled by fresh oil being able to wash off this
mess, much less remove the  heat that will warp your rings pronto.
Consider just how much bigger a chunk that can pass the pickup screen and
race into the oil pump grinder of fastly diminishing pressure potential.
All from inadequate lubrication inspections.

&gt;On the plus side, going to the
&gt;junkyards is much more fun now, as there is an increasing bounty of gauges,
&gt;switches, motors, and other electrical parts that can be salvaged for other
&gt;projects.  In my original statement above though, I was only referring to
&gt;the engine itself, not the rest of the vehicle.

Mine is a holistic approach. It considers the vehicle as a whole integrated
system of sub-systems. I don't do oil changes. I do Lubrication
Inspections. One example. If review of the past WRITTEN service history
reveals it has been a year or more since the front wheel bearings have been
checked for slack, I will make checking both front wheels with a quick and
simple test a part of the inspection. Slack bearly perceptable, ie within
spec?? Move on. Slack nearing acceptable limits? Take 5 minutes to adjust
the tolerance.

Wheel bearing tolerances are a part of the lubrication inspection because
they are required for the lubricant to do it's duty within it's specified
rating. If I take up an eighth turn for proper adjustment, I note it on the
invoice, turning it into historical data that is so superior to memory for
future reference. I can then anticipate wheel bearings on their way to
replacement and plan to replace them at the next convienient scheduled
inspection. 

Also, much much better to upgrade features with newbang factory systems
than tack on whatever generic junk is found on the FLAPS shelf or from J.C.
Whipme. Typically less cost for superior function as well. Also, if you
must replace a piece of wire in the harness, so nice to have a few chunks
of wiring harness from a donor to pick and use the stock color code wire
cliped from under the sheathing in &quot;as new&quot; supple condition.  

I will soon (maybe by the summer to catch the x-mas season) be releasing a
new product that has excellent potential to replace some $10,000 in a &quot;Full
Monty&quot; equipped New Beattle. It is designed to retrofit all prior
production vehicles.  I have no firm data to fix the price, but my sense is
somewhere between $10 and $20 from a better spec Asian manufacturer. I can
at least consider staying within my philosophy by releasing a limited
edition of $100 German made examples with French stiched Morroco leather
Owner's Manual and Maintenance Log in Oxblood or Olive for the few most
uncompromisingly anal among us. 

&gt;&gt;&gt;I left a set of plugs in my Mustang (snip)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Cast iron is not aluminum.
&gt;
&gt;True.  In an aluminum cylinder head like my bus I would not be able to
&gt;sleep nights if I didn't remove the plugs at least once every 10k miles and
&gt;reapply anti-sieze to the threads.  But I wouldn't put in new plugs, which
&gt;was the point I was trying to make.

There is no question in my mind that ignition systems of current production
are, as well, at least one order of magnatude mo betta than conventional
early systems, doubling spark energy at least. Much better combustion,
cleaner running. On the other hand, conventional systems remain a whole
magnatude easier to diagnose. I can typically validate conventional systems
in 1 to 20 minutes. 

On the other hand, the intermitant glitching much more prevalent in current
production high energy systems can be very difficult to catch. If you don't
follow each step of the procedure in order, misdiagnosis will result in
spending the time to misdiagnose and replace the wrong part. On the other
hand, many consider it less costly to forgo diagnosis time for the best
immediate guess approach and replace the transistor unit, then the hall
sensor or light trigger, then the coil that was as well fried by the
glitchy upstream component. 

If your first guess is the coil and you whip in a new one and it runs
again, CONGRATULATIONS, you wizard you!!!!!! If a week later the item that
killed the original coil fries the new one, will you be happy 'cause you
think it's can't be the coil 'cause you just replaced that? So you replace
the transisor unit, the foundation of the problem in this senerio. Gee,
still no go. Replace the Hall sensor. No go?????? Jeeze, there is nothing
left to replace 'cause you &quot;tuned it up&quot; not long ago by replacing the
cap/rotor/plugs/HT wires, some of which was flatly unessesary under the
inspection process??????

The new fried coil, like every other component in the high energy system,
can only be diagnosed accurately by following step by step validating
procedures, skipping any step verboten 'cause it can kick open the door to
false impressions upon which is founded the next series of time-killing
throwing money events that opts out and post the sales pitch. &quot;FOR SALE,
just needs a tune up, $500 obo.&quot;

&gt;
&gt;I might get flamed for saying this, but I really wish that VW cylinder
&gt;heads were cast iron.  I would gladly pay a 50lb weight penalty for the
&gt;added durability of iron in that area.  Think about it - no more stripped
&gt;spark plug threads, no more dropped valve seats, no more exhaust studs
&gt;pulling out.  Wouldn't that be nice?

The problem is cast iron will not transfer heat sufficiantly for adequate
cooling with an air transfer design, at least, not if it has a VW/Porsche
heritage. The weight difference just says no louder.
