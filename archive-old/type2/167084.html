Subject: RE: [T2] Tech assist in Texas

The tech assist is for someone else, I'm in South Carolina.  This is a guy who
found the Full Moon site and just got an auto 77 Westie.  The shop he took the
van to has recommended a carb swap, and as I have done that on an auto, I know
what a PITA it is with the auto trans and that it shouldn't be done unless
there is no other way to get the bus on the road.JT Beaufort, SC Running: 1.
