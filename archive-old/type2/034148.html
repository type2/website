Mike:

&quot;the old torsion bars slipped out of the old front beam like nothin' but
putting them in the new one is hard.&quot;

You might try tying a string tightly around the torsion bar bundle about an
inch from the ends before you insert them into the tube.  This worked great
for me twice years back when reinstalling torsion bars on bugs so I think
it might work on the bus also.  The string holds the torsion bar bundle
together allowing it to hold its shape, and allowing all the bars to fit
into the center gizmo which secures the bars in the tube..  As you slide
the bars into the center gizmo, the string slides back harmlessly, and
remains inside the tube.
