Subject: Re: [T2] Whiny rear-end


&gt;I've got a loud whining sound coming from the rear of my '74. It's
&gt;gradually gotten worse and I assume it's a bearing of some sort - probably
&gt;a wheel bearing. I'm having trouble telling which side of the bus it's
&gt;coming from. The whining goes away when I go through left-handed turns at
&gt;speed. This would make me believe that it is the right (driver's side) rear
&gt;wheel bearing that is going. Any hints?
&gt;
&gt;BTW, I went up to Cookeville to visit Chris Mills and bring him his
&gt;tachometer adapter. While looking at each others' busses I pointed out that
&gt;my fuel tank always leaked out the fill hole and that I couldn't find a gas
&gt;cap that fit right. We then looked at his bus and realized that someone
&gt;installed the outer ring of the fill neck UPSIDE-DOWN on my bus! That fix
&gt;alone was worth the 100 mile trip!

Check the tightness of the axle nut.
