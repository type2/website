I got mine in the mail yesterday too but haven't had a chance to subject 
any of the samples to my torture test (inside the bus in 70 degree sunshine 
*laugh*).  The &quot;original&quot; stuff is same ice-shield stuff that I got at the 
Home Depot in Canada for something like $40/roll.  Identical.  These guys 
are charging many times that - I have to admire their ingenuity 
though.  The original stuff had already smeared and run in the envelope 
while in route to me.  Of the four samples, three closely resembled 
commonly available roofing material.  The fourth was much more plasticky 
and thinner.  Didn't look like it would melt, but it was rather stiff and I 
question whether it would adhere well to non-flat surfaces or deaden much 
sound (it was very lightweight).

&gt;They say the original stuff is just like Dynamat, not at all,  it only got
&gt;soft at a very high temperature but it didn't run at all.

&gt;Looks like again, you get what you pay for, so grab your ankles and pay for
&gt;the good stuff.
