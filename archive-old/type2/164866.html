Subject: RE: [T2] Welders and Bus Content

Jason,

I don't broker art, so you are on your own! :)

You will have to commission one of my pieces to see my welding. Or come
baby-sit my son, answer my phone and emails so I can take the dozen or so
hours to setup, photograph, edit, post and write copy on the welding images.
Not as easy as it sounds when you have projects backed up several months.
Unlike Kelly and other Auto Restorers, I don't really have to prove my
process to clients, I only sell the result. Unfortunately for the curious, I
don't bother with the intensive in-process photo-documentation. My
documentation in the form of sketches and notations is safely kept in my
sketchbook or on my Tablet PC.

However the curious are welcome to come by the studio and volunteer their
time doing the hard labor of art and I'll show them the few tricks I have
picked up with the fancy welders.

As for bus content, I spent my first real day off in 4 months up at
BustedBus getting a '79 Westy ready for its long trip to SoCal. On Monday
she is jumping on the back of a transport truck and going to a very cool new
owner who will show the old girl some surf and sun. Word to the wise though,
if at all possible, avoid any Vanagon to Bay engine swaps. We have nicknamed
the conversion Van-again-and-again-and-again because there are more
challenges than rewards. But no hippy fixes and we did it right, it just
took a bunch of time.

Y'all have a good weekend and close the welding thread for a while. I'll try
to shoot more in-process images at some point and I'll let y'all know.

Peace,

Jon Stiles

&gt; Ok Don--
&gt;
&gt; You first.
&gt;
&gt; LOL----
&gt;

Amateur hour is next week... If your guys want to see pictures of how I
weld, we may be able to get Stiles to sell it as &quot;abstract&quot; art... VERY
abstract.

I agree with Don though. We got the pimp welders around here, but no real
display of how they use there skills to teach us rookies.
