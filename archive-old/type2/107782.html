  Hi Steve,

  So you pulled off the line to the carb placed the end in a jar/can turned
the engine over * remote starter/or a helper while you monitored it* and got a
good spurting stream of fuel out the end. Yes?

  Is the electro-magnetic switch on the side of the carb tight, and working???
Take the wire off of it turn the ignition switch on and touch the wire to the
switch it should click if it's working properly.

  Pull the carb off, pull down on the throttle lever, and look down inside to
see that your getting a good spray of fuel down the throat.Yes? something else
is causing it not to start  *Air-Fuel-Spark*

  Was it running very good before you started changing fuel lines etc?
Timing/dwell set to spec? Condenser, points, plugs, wires all new/good? Have
you done a compression test on this engine?

  How old is the carb?  original, aftermarket?

  From here with written diagnostics available my first thought is the
condenser may have gone south,  if it's getting fuel using the above carb
test.

  Give me some more feed-back,we will get it running!!!

  Thanks for all the input.
  Did tune up 2 weeks ago and it ran fine.  New points,condenser,plugs.  Wires
all in good shape.  Points dwell at 48 compression above 115 on all but #4
which was just under 100 (yea, tear down after the snow hits which may be this
weekend).  Good gas and good spurting at fuel pump and at carb,  but carb
doesn't seem to be getting gas.  Took carb off and spray cleaned and no
change.  I have records of repair back to the early 90's and have no record of
carb rebuild or replacement.  Any suggestions on repair or do I need a new
carb.  Or other options to try?
