Hey, gang!

Help save my '70 Microbus!! &quot;Kenny&quot; got a wedgie from a minivan up his butt 
and I've gone nuts trying to find a rear apron that'll bolt onto his fanny! 
The best I've been able to do is find one that was bent around a Beetle 
muffler for $35. I'm not asking for a handout, just someone to sell me what 
they have laying around or a lead to one.

Hope you can help...
