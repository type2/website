David, I don't know if your mechanic was lying to you about gas in *your* oil, but it is possible, and it is a very real threat to your rods and other internals, especially main bearings.

The gas gets in because of a rich running condition, or due to failed spark. It slips right past your rings and into the case.

One of the ways that it manifests itself is that you seem to have *more* oil rather than less...and yes, the smell of gas is evident.

Also, the gas will make your engine run even cooler than it normally would, though I wouldn't suggest this as an alternative way to cool your engine.

It could simply be a result of a really badly adjusted carburator, but it can also be caused by vacuum leaks. Check for leaks along the intake manifold, especially at the manifold boots.

Good luck! Joe

&gt;He said the rebuilder told him it wasn't under warranty
&gt;because I had some kind of leak in the carburetor, and gas had gotten into the
&gt;crankcase and mixed with the oil.  He said this reduced the oil's ability to
&gt;lubricate and caused the thrown rod with no advanced warning signs of
&gt;overheating and no drop in oil level.
