&gt; Has anyone else on the list hooked up a Hyfire with a stock FI system?
&gt; If so, could you please tell me how you handled the FI trigger wire?
&gt; Specifically, did you connect it to the Hyfire's white &quot;points&quot; wire or
&gt; the yellow &quot;tach&quot; wire?  Did you use the tach adapter?  If so, what
&gt; Hyfire wire did you connect it to?  Did you have to use the diode

Ok, an update.

I thought a little about the problem last night, and determined that 
the problem must be the use of the tach output from the CDI box.

So, this morning I went out to the bus and made a very simple 
modification to my terminal block wiring.  I remove the &quot;tach output&quot; 
wire, and jumpered the &quot;from points&quot; CDI wire to the terminal where the 
&quot;to tach&quot; wire was previously connected.

Bus now starts and runs.

However, it seems to be running VERY rich.  At first I thought it could 
be the normal warm-up enrichment, so I let the engine idle for a few 
minutes to warm up.  Unfortunately, it continued to stink up the 
neighborhood, and seems to be idling much lower than it did before 
after the warm-up was complete (isn't this also a symptom of running 
too rich?  too much fuel for the air charge that's provided leading to 
poor idle?)

For variable elimination, I disconnected the tach adapter.  Bus would 
not start, so that piece definitely seems to be mandatory.

So, for reference, here is how the wiring now looks:

  1---2   3---4          9--10  11  12
  |   |   |   |          |   |   |   |
  5   6---7   8         13  14  15  16

Vertical bars indicate shunted terminals, and horizontal bars indicate 
permanent jumpers.

Permanent connections to the terminals:

  3 - tach
  5 - trigger output of Pertronix [black wire]
  6 - FI trigger
  7 - to Test Network terminal 13
  9 - power for Pertronix [red wire]
10 - power for reverse lights / double-relay
13 - +12v from ignition switch
15 - to coil +
16 - to coil -

For the Hyfire, the Hyfire needs to sense the trigger, we must provide 
switched +12v to the Hyfire, and the Hyfire must control the coil.  
Thus we remove the stock-configuration jumpers and connect the 
following Hyfire wires:

  1 - white (points input + tach adapter lead)
14 - thin red (+12v switched input + tach adapter lead)
11 - orange (to coil +)
12 - thin black (to coil -)

NOTE: The yellow &quot;to tach&quot; wire of the Hyfire is unused!

For the stock ignition system, we want the coil to sense the trigger 
and get power from switched +12v, so we make the following connections 
after disconnecting the Hyfire:

Jumper 8 -&gt; 12
Jumper 14 -&gt; 11

As far as the &quot;running rich&quot; problem... I am guessing that the FI is 
triggering too frequently.  I am pretty sure I have the Hyfire 
configured for &quot;4 cylinder mode&quot;, but I will pull of the side plate 
today and verify that.  I suppose I could have set it to &quot;6 cylinder 
mode&quot; by mistake, but I'm not exactly sure what that setting causes the 
Hyfire to change in its behavior.
