Subject: Bus Cooling Tin
Mime-Version: 1.0

	While we're on the subject of bettle 1600's into a bus.  What specific
cooling tin pieces are different for the bus?  I assume the dual port
cylinder head pieces are the same and the fan shroud. Is it just the front
and rear pieces ?  I have a '71 1600 dual port bus .  I pulled the engine
yesterday and am in the process of removing some of the tin in anticipation
of a couple of new cylinder heads from Boston Engine.   Which pieces should
I be especially careful to preserve?
