Subject: '73 Auto Trans -Filler/Dipstick

Dear List:

On the '73 auto trans, does the connection for the filler tube/dipstick
into the sump plate have a washer?  If so, can someone describe it?  I
thought there was one when I pulled mine apart a few days ago, but I
seem to have developed a leak and I think it's missing (if it was there)
now that I put it back together.

Thanks.
