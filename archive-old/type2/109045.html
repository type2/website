Subject: Re: [T2] Differences from vw pancake to Porsche 914 pancake

&gt; Any way, I used the 2L 914 engine. There is a link
 that you can go to that says how much horse power the
 different engines will produce according to the engine
 serial number. Can some one fill me in on this? 
 
http://www.tunacan_dot_net/t4/reference/case.htm

&gt; I am mainly familiar with the 2L 914 engine. Most of
 the parts on this engine are the same (or similar)as a
 2L Bus engine.  One of the main differences is the
 heads. These heads are made to run at a higher
 compression ratio. 

Don't forget that the 914 has flat top pistons..... the bus has dished pistons. 
The cam is different also.
