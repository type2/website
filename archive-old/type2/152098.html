&gt; I'm only seventy so not an old phart like yourself but I do have a an old

&gt; dial type to be harder to read than the digital. I'm surprised that at your
&gt; age you are still able to read the vernier.

mine is an older dial caliper with large numbers on the scale, didn't
intentionally buy it, it was the one I liked. so it is easy to read

&gt; Personally I have found the &quot;get what you pay for&quot; rule to be often untrue.

&quot;pay&quot; isn't always in money  &quot;TANSTAAFL&quot;   I run Linux, free, but not
free.
