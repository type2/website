Subject: FS: '71 Dormobile (in U.K.)

Damon (my boyfriend) is selling his '71 Dormobile.
It is situated in Bristol, U.K.

1600cc, complete original Dormobile conversion in super
condition (except for small rip in one bunk). New sills, wheel-
arches, exhaust, headlights, starter motor. No rust. 12 months
MOT, taxed (soon to be exempt).
For sale as we don't need 2 campervans, and he wants funds
to restore his '59 bug. 1,700 UK pounds ONO
