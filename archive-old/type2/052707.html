Subject: [T2] 'z' bed for vanagon

We recently acquired an 83 vanagon and wish to do some camping in it this 
summer.  Have heard about something called a 'Z' bed which supposedly 
installs easily, folds into the cargo area, and is the size of a queen bed. 
Has anyone out the had experience with this product and could I get some 
feedback on any/all aspects of it?
Thanks
