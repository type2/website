Subject: Re: [VB] Wanted to let let you know...

I feel like I need to jump in here...

Dawn Smyth is one of the coolest people I know.  She is also completely 
dedicated to the work of busing and saving our beloved Type 2s.  I 
would much rather buy something from someone of this nature, than some 
company capitalizing without impact or representation in the bus 
community.

I will be first to state the Dawn can be on the slow side and this 
should be noted before ordering from PLF.  However, I will always order 
my canvas replacement parts from Dawn, due to the impact and 
involvement she has on our community.

my two cents,

&gt; Hi Folks
&gt;
&gt; I hope the &quot;powers that be&quot; will forgive this post with little direct
&gt; Volkswagen content. Promise not to do it again.It does relate to 
&gt; Volkswagen
&gt; however if you order parts and services for your VW bus over the 
&gt; Internet or
&gt; through the postal service. Wanted to pass the word my bus bra finally
&gt; appeared Saturday about two days after posting the following to Dawn 
&gt; Smyth at
&gt; Peace, Love, and Freedom (PLF/Volkswagen)  in the mail. Good timing 
&gt; for me as
&gt; I can now drop this issue and move on. Things I've learned 
&gt; include....&quot;trust,
&gt; but verify&quot;, certify and document, don't hesitate to contact your state
&gt; consumer protection agency or division if you have a problem. For any 
&gt; of you
&gt; still holding issues like mine, I recommend it.
