Hello all!  I'm a newbie to the world of Volks. bussing having just acquired
a '80 vanagon from a friend.  I need to have the engine rebuilt and, in
looking through Muir's book I saw a section on the Rveeco Oil Cooler, which
sounded like a great thing on paper ... does anybody have information on
these things?  Are they now the standard or have they been replaced with
something better?  Please excuse my naivete ... and thanks for any
information in advance!

-Kevin
