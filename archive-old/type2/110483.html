Subject: Re: [T2] '70 front brake shoe adjustment stars, possible
  lubricants w/o teard...

Hiya Bill,

After all these years of not much use I'd opt out for &quot;The Real Man&quot; 
approach.  You'd be surprised at how much general crud can accumulate inside a wheel.  
That and the viability of your wheel bearing grease would make pulling the 
front drum off a good idea.  
To really get &quot;into&quot; the stars and their wheel cylinders you'll have to pull 
the shoes off.  But that will give you the chance to really look over those 
brakes and do a whiz-bang job of cleaning out the stars.  A hint:  pull the 
stars out and chase their threads, same for the inside of their respective wheel 
cylinders.  A SMALL amount of wheel bearing grease on these threads will do 
just fine.
