Subject:      Re: Re; insurance

I have a '82 Honda CM450 that is my SO's designated vehicle, Now
that's the real cheap way to go.. In this state all you need is a
registered title and an insurance policy on the bike (or non-existant
bike if all you have is a title)

PS I have some &quot;no name&quot; Insurance company and they classify the Westy
as a camper, But for personal property tax records it is classified
as a Kombi

&gt; deductable. But.. if we add a beater, or whatever, and have minimum
&gt; liability insurance then the Trper with the same coverage dropped to
&gt; $450 per year.
