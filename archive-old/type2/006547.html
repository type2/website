&gt;&gt;  I would appreciate your feedback on the topic of sealant.  There is a
posting from someone who said that a sealant should be applied.  I
understood that sealants were necessary or recommended, that the rubber
would make the seal if properly set on clean metal.  What's your view?  &lt;&lt;
