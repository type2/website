The only game I can find here in Great Falls Montana is an ol boy who spin
balances the wheels mounted on your car.  The machine looks like it's from
the 50's, it spins the wheel and uses a strobe to detect the true-ness.
I've asked around at other tire stores and am told it's a great system since
the brake drum, lugs and nuts are all balanced in place.  It's just an old
time consuming process and the high volume guys don't want to mess with it.
