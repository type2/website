got the westy back to boston from arizona in four days. a lot quicker than
i had figured it would take. she ran beautifully, and today gets a
well-deserved oil change. it's very strange to be in the middle of the
desert one day and reeling in bluefish on a boat in the cape cod bay a few
days later. anyway, i had it checked over by Anton's Auto Haus in
Albuquerque before i left, and Gene says it's in great shape. compression
was 120 125 125 125, which made me very happy. a couple minor adjustments,
new points and plugs and a nice chat about vw campers, and i was on my way.

now, on to the pop-top. My '71 westy appears to have the pop-top of a later
model. at least i think it does. the luggage rack is in front, and the
pop-top is hinged at the rear of the bus and goes up higher in the back,
like the later model westies i've seen in pictures. The question i have is,
do i have the right pop-top for my year? is there a way i can tell for sure
what i have [i could take a picture and put it on the web if that'll help].
I need to get a new seal for it and I don't want to order the wrong one.

Also, the only thing holding the pop-top down is the stud in the front
center [inside, leading edge of the pop-top] that has a round, black
knob-like handle on it. it fits into two vertical plates bolted to the roof
when the pop-top is in the closed position. i've seen some pictures of
pop-tops that have rubber pull-down handles that hold it down. am i
supposed to have these as well or was that for a different year/design?

...about to go get greasy with the bus.

thanks,
