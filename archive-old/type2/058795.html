&gt; what years could i salvage a nosecone off of and put it on my 72?
&gt; i just want the lower part under the windsheild
&gt; also could i get this part new, and if possible the asking price.....

I can get you a brand new one for $139.  This is the &quot;73-up&quot; style with the
turn signal holes above the headlights, but can relatively easily be
modified to work on '68-72 (either relocate the holes or the signals).
