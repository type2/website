&lt;&lt; Why do they puncture all the gas tanks?  Why don't they just remove the
senders?  Especially with beetles!  They even put a hole in the bus gas
tanks from below ruining them. &gt;&gt;

To quickly drain the gas into a tank to prevent it from contaminating
the actual ground the yard is standing on. A local junk yard was EPA'd
out of business a while back and the subsequent clean up took over a 
year and left a huge hole that went down about 30 feet before it was
filled in. The yard WAS next to a small stream, BTW, that was very
iridescent in color while the yard was in business...;-(
