From the illustrations it would appear to be a seal for an aftermarket
popup/removal sunroof.  It may be a generic seal to fit a variety of
sunroofs or aftermarket square skylight/roof vents.


Since he indicates &quot;roof vent&quot; in the auction description I suspect this
seal will work on the later Vanagon campers that have a square roof vent
in the poptop.
