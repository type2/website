Subject: Re: [T2] GL4 vs. GL5

The problem here is that people are used to higher numbers and letters
meaning simply better protection.  In oil, SG was better than SF which was
better than SE.  Simple!

Unfortunately, this doesn't apply to transmission GL numbers.  Here they
just refer to different specifications, not levels of performance.

It's even worse with brake fluid.  DOT-4 is better than, and compatible
with, DOT-3, but DOT-5 is a completely different fluid and is often
incompatible with DOT-3/4 seal materials.

Use what the book says and you'll seldom be disappointed!

George
