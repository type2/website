Subject: Re: [T2] Tire size

&gt; Is that data correct? Just curious about what seems, at first glance, to not
&gt; make sense.
&gt;
&gt; Bridgestone: 195 diameter is .1&quot; smaller than the 185, and is +14 revs/mile.
&gt;
&gt; Yoko: 195 diameter is .1&quot; larger, and is only 1 rev/mile different.
&gt;
&gt; The Yoko 195 is LARGER? And while a .1&quot; change produces 14 rev/mile
&gt; difference in the Bridgestone, it only yields 1 rev/mile diffrence in the
&gt; Yoko?

Yes it is correct.
Because every tire is made differently.
A tire is a circle until you put a car on it and then it is a flat circle
and every circle flattens a little differently.
So they measure it and politely supply the data.
