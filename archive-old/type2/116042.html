JC Whitney moved right here to LaSalle, IL (a bit west of Morris).  They
have a regular retail store here, too.  If you haven't checked out JC
Whitney since your youth, you might want to check again.  Sure, they still
have inexpensive stuff, but they also have built quite a business in late
model import tuning.

When it comes to stuff for the Bus, some of their stuff is junk, and some is
stuff that you would buy from most of the other aircooled vendors.
Unfortunately, they don't do a good job of telling you in their catalog what
brand names they are selling.

I used the JC Whitney soundproofing stuff (both their Q-Pad-type tiles and
foil-backed &quot;NASA&quot; insulation) exclusively in my Bus, and it was excellent.
Often, these items sell for far less in their retail store than in the
catalog (especially the rolls of &quot;NASA&quot; insulation).

Just another point of view.
