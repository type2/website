Subject: 77 Westy Update

Well, I just came back from the shop that has my Westy. They managed to get 
the engine running. He said he pulled the plugs, did a compression test, and 
then the engine turned okay. He said he thinks some carbon or something must 
have gotten in. The good news is, it's running.

The bad news is, the compression is not good: 100-135-135-100. Also, it's 
leaking oil bad on one side--he said the push rod tubes need to be replaced 
(the PO had just finished doing one side but didn't get to the other). And, 
there is a problem with the ignition wiring. The black wire on the left side 
of the engine that I guess is supposed to go to the coil is not connected and 
looks melted. He said that will need to be looked into if the bus is ever to 
start without a separate wire hooked from the coil to the pos. terminal on 
the battery.

So what do I do now? He's working up a price on a rebuild, I told him I might 
just drive it home. Would it make the drive home w/low compression? It's only 
about 10 miles, but there are some big hills to go up, unless I go the long 
way.

Well, many thanks to all of you. I'm overwhelmed by the number of responses 
I've gotten and also at just how much everyone knows. I hope one day I'll 
know as much and can help someone new like myself.
