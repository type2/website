&gt;Question for the list...
&gt;In the back of my mind, I seem to remember someone
&gt;once telling me to use 2nd or 3rd geard when trying to
&gt;push start a vehicle.  At the time, we were pushing a
&gt;Ch*vy or a F_at_rd.  Is there a preferred gear for push

Way back in the early '60s when I was learning to drive I was told to 
put the transmission in second to do a push start. I didn't know why, 
the old timers told me to do it and they seemed to know what they 
were talking about.

gear&quot;, one generation between the engine and axle, almost like a 
direct drive. This would probably be the gear best to use for push 
starting.
