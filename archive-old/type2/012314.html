4.57 is stock final in the 091 late box.  About anything is available sort of
depending what you want to do.  5.43 and 5.86 sets from diesels are
VW factory parts.  Weddle can cut off a waterboxer shaft to give you
a 4.86.  The gear ratios are all over the place depending on the year,
look in Bentley.  There used to be a great German site showing each
box by code leters with its contents but it is kaput.  Changes are basically
minor within the stuff sent to the US anyway for those years if at all so,
whatever Bentley says should be close enough.

Of course as always I'll try to plug my gear ratio calculator software, DavidR
used to have it up on the www but it seems to be gone.  If anyone wants a
copy I'll send it.  It compares ratios versus finals, tire sizes, showing
speed
at rpm and tpm at speed on an excel spreadsheet.  Some people have
found it convenient.
