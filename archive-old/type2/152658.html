Subject: Re: [T2] Wind Shield - Window Removal

In a message dated 10/6/05 11:51:55 AM, ChristianH_at_mdcresearch_dot_com writes:


&gt; Can anyone give me some direction on how I can remove my wind shield. I
&gt; have some nasty rust creeping out from under the seal that needs to be
&gt; taken care of. I'm not sure how to even approach the removal. Are there
&gt; some tools that make it easier? I also have some windows that need to be
&gt; removed (rust repair), is the process the same?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;    I've removed side windows and reused the rubber seal - Gently prised the
rubber lip from the inside with a friend supporting the glass from the out-
side, but I don't think I'd try it with the windshield. A new seal is 
probably
a best bet for the windshield. Slice the seal on the outside with a wide
freshly honed chisel and push the glass from the inside with a friend or
two on the outside...I'd sacrifice the seal rather than take the chance on
cracking the windshield... ;-(
