Subject: '69 linen closet and water tank

Greetings,
In what seems like a never ending search for a
within-driving-distance linen closet for my '69 Westy,
I got to thinking about exactly what other year's
linen closet would fit my bus. Would it be only 68-71
or should I expand my search to other years? Would any
other years fit...earlier or later? And if anybody out
there has a spare water holding tank they would like
to sell, I'm all over it. I'm currently using an empty
2 1/2 gallon Poland Spring water container...it works
OK but I'd like the real deal. The real pain is that I
have to pull out the sink unit to fill it.  Thanks for
any help.

Doug
