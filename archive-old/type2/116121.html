Subject: Re: [T2] CHT location change?

Hi Dave,

I installed a VDO CHT sensor under the plug in my 1.8L dual-carb engine 
just before Everybus this year.

Personally, I found the install to be a piece of cake. I put the spark 
plug into the socket, bent the connector tongue carefully around the 
socket and then used the sensor wire to ensure the plug couldn't fall 
out of the socket while I was fishing around under there to line up 
with the spark plug hole. Once it's bent to fit around the socket it 
should stay that way, and will be no problem to remove the next time 
you change plugs.

My sender wire has a fitting about 8&quot; after the sensor, this allows 
easier disconnects when dropping the engine. Disconnecting this will 
mean less problems with the wire tangling when you remove that plug.

I haven't changed a plug wwith it yet, but I really don't think it will 
be that much of a hassle and I find the peace-of-mind I get from 
accurate engine data is well worth it.

As always, YMMV.

Happy trails,

&gt; Ok, so I have CHT sender and am looking at it and my 3/4 head last

&gt; There is no way that I am putting this thing under the sparkplug.
&gt; First, I would have to bend it to get it to fit in the recessed spark 
&gt; plug hole.
&gt; Second, every time I change plugs, it would try to hang up on the plug 
&gt; or try to come out with the plug...hard to get plug back in properly 
&gt; and then get it torqued without twisting the sender wire all around.
