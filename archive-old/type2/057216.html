Subject: Brake reservoir 

Two &quot;dumb&quot; questions from a newbie:
1.  Where the heck is the brake fluid reservoir in a '78 Westy?

2.  Any good stuff about draining and refilling tranny case with
new gear oil and a dollop of STP.  My shifting has gotten a bit
cranky.

Go easy on me..I'm new to this.
Thanks,
Ed Thorpe
