Thanks to everyone who helped out with my distributor problem.  The consensus
was that this is the ground strap that takes the current when the points are
closed.  I replaced it using solder wicking, and drilled and tapped a hole in
the plate and attached it with an eye terminal.  Seems to have done the trick.
I appreciate all the help.
