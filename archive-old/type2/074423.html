Subject: RE: [VB] broken head stud on new rebuild

Ronnie- I'm still learning about head bolt size and such. Are you suggesting 
that 8mm bolts should not be used? Does that mean case savers should not be 
used? Reason I ask is because I'm planning this spring to drop my engine and 
replace my 10mm bolts that are pulling out with 8mm/case savers (if I got 
that right, maybe I'm confused). Would you suggest something else?

&gt;
&gt;   If you used  new studs supplied with the engine (8mm) they only torque 
&gt;to
&gt;16 ft lbs and have a tendency to stretch and break at the thread. Seen this
&gt;happen to many times and I will not use them, even though they come in a VW
&gt;box. If they were the ones that come in a plain white box, like mentioned 
&gt;in
&gt;a previous post replace them all with genuine ones from an old engine or
&gt;call RIMCO and order a reconditioned set from them but specify,
&gt;reconditioned and NOT NEW.
&gt;
&gt;Ronnie  been there done that
&gt;
&gt;ps. I have core buyers who give 1 dollar for OG studs, especially 8mm
