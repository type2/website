Subject: Re: [T2] Serious &amp; Simple Vacuum Leak Finding

Hi Cliff,

An unlit propane torch also works well for this. You should be  
careful working with starter fluid, it will puddle on the block and a  
stray spark can light it easily. With propane the residue blows away  
from the engine and spark ignition is less likely. And even if it  
does somehow light the engine won't be damaged.

In either case, keep a fire extinguisher handy when doing this.

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
