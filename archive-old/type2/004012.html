I just looked in the Bentley wiring diagrams......in my initial reply I said it
was the crank sensor connecter.
In the engine section of the 77/78 diagram, there is a 3 pin connecter, G7. The
middle wire goes to #63 on the lower bar.
G7 is the 'TDC marker unit' and only feeds the Computer Analysis System that are
wired to Socket T 20. [that square white one in the top right corner of the
engine hatch area]
The sensor is pressed into the case at the flywheel area. Section 5, page 25
shows the hole in the case. The line from 3 goes over it.



&gt; [...]
&gt;
&gt; &gt; HI all hope i can help,
&gt; &gt;     I just looked at my 78 and the blue one goes to the cold start the brown
&gt; &gt; goes to the temp sensor and the black goes to the aux air control.
&gt; &gt;     The temp sendor is a PITA to get to, just remember that the half moon
&gt; &gt; side of the plug faces down.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I thought of those 3 initialy, but they are all 2 pin terminals and not
&gt; grey...... here is the 1st paragraph of the post:
&gt;
&gt; ''Last night, I discovered an unconnected wire dangling about in the engine
&gt; compartment (recent rebuild).  It is grey, the unconnected-end has a
&gt; three-prong attachment (bent, incidentally), and it appears to be attached
&gt; to something below the air intake distributor, to the firewall (tin).  I can
&gt; only reach it by jamming my hand beneath the AFM and snaking towards (&amp;
&gt; below) the gas tank.''
&gt;
&gt; I just looked at 2 FI harness's I have laying in the driveway, a 78 and a 79
&gt; Cal. Neither have a 3 pin 'any color' plug. I thought maybe the microswitch
&gt; connecter, but it is 2 separate wires.
&gt; I looked at my 77 up around the heater fan......no grey plugs.
&gt; I don't believe your wire is part of the FI system. Is there any way you can
&gt; follow the wire in the other direction??
