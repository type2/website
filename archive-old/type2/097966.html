Subject: Re: Mechanical Ignition Switch - Rekey

Go to the Library in http://www.type2_dot_com/  Go to I and then pick
ignition
switch.  There is a great articile with great pictures called Bay
Ignition Lock Cylinder Replacement by Mike Howles.  I used it and it
was very helpful.  


Hi.
&gt; 
&gt; On a late bay (1978), are there any instructions/sites that give
info on how 
&gt; to take apart the mechankical (the part with the key) ignition
switch so 
&gt; that I can get to the wafers to re-key the 'cylinder'??
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
&gt;
