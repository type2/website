Hello Volks,

I am selling a '73 Kombi CHEAP.

$200 bucks takes it.

Catch? It doesn't run. *S*

The body is good, interior and headliner in good shape. Automatic
transmission. Still has original owners manual.

You want it? Trailer it home and it's yours.

I'm located just outside Cookeville, Tennessee. This would make an
excellent Bus to restore.

Courtney '77 Kombi, &quot;Myrtle&quot;
