&gt; I found Tri-flow at OSH (for the local folks). It was hard to find at

I'm surprised it was so hard to find.  When I was in high school, I 
worked at a small-town hardware store, and Tri-Flow was stocked right 
next to the WD-40 (and it sold a lot better than WD-40, too, because it 
works so much better).

I'm pretty sure my local mom-and-pop hardware store{,s} stock{s,} it 
right next to the WD-40, as well.

IIRC, Tri-Flow is Teflon-based.

(BTW, it's also great on bicycle chains, if you can't be bothered to 
use chain wax... so you can probably pick it up at bike shops, too...)
