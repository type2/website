&gt; If you cut material away from the skirt you will disturb this and

hello Guys  This isn't really all true. On racing pistons they will remove a 
large part of the skirt as this will allow high rpms and there are some 
pistons that don't have any skirt at all.  Now it would work better for a road 
engine to have them . Later  Mark Dearing
