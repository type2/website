Subject: Re: [T2] Replacing mirror glass

I got a good set of aftermarket replacement from Bus Depot.  No rust after
5 years.  They are a good (not perfect) match for the OEM mirrors.  They
seem to be made of stainless and have a small diamond-shaped logo stamped
into the back of the mirror.

I considered swapping the mirror glass, but the size is just a bit
different, enough so that it won't fit.  You might consider taking your
OEM mirrors to a glass shop and see if they can cut mirror glass to fit if
you really want to stay original, but the cost will be much more.
