&gt; speaking of snow and busses. i know there has got to
&gt; be some crazy stories out there regarding people
&gt; driving their busses in the snow. so, let's hear 'em!!

back when I was younger and much more foolish I once bet someone I could
do a 4 wheel drift through a turn in my 60  23window deluxe....later I
learned some things about swing axles that turned my hair white...but I
did win a steak dinner and as a poor college student that was the best
meal I had in months.

I also used to take that thing out in the snowstorms just to play in the
snow.. (I was big time crazy) just sliding it around parking lots and
driving past all the folks stuck on the side of the road....don't know why
but I never remember being very cold....??  it was my 71 that I always
remember as the &quot;Cold&quot; bus

??? Bob
got my ski waxed up waiting for the snow to come, or at least cold enough
to turn on the snow guns!!!
