Hi Volks!

Yes.  Been there, witnessed that -- sometime in the late '70s,
as a kid, in a Bay of unknown vintage and condition.  The door
opened, &quot;derailed&quot; at the front end, swung around the rear mount,
hit the rear fender, tore off and was retrieved lying flat on
the ground behind the bus.  (And those being more innocent times,
the door was then loaded into the bus and the trip resumed, 
despite a busful of kids now free to fall out of the bus.)

&gt; Presents &quot; these busses as unsafe&quot;....

So what?  I dare doubt the Ford Model T fan community has such
problems with Laurel &amp; Hardy movies ... :-)

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
