Subject: Re: [T2] Pilot Bear WILL NOT COME OUT

[...]

I had one like that. If I remember the size, I got a 5/8&quot; fine thread bolt and
screwed it into the bearing shell. It bottomed out in the crank and I keep
turning it and the shell followed the threads out the crank. I think I had to
grind the 1st couple of threads to get it started.


&gt; My pilot bearing absolutely positively will not come
&gt; out.  It was so destroyed when I first got to it the
&gt; bearings were sitting in a pile.  I rented a pilot
&gt; bearing puller(2 prong) and it just slips off or bends
&gt; the edges.  I have now commenced cutting a line
&gt; through the middle of it and it still wont come out.
&gt; It is even hard to distinguish between the pilot
&gt; bearing and crankshaft metal.  Have these things been
&gt; melted together, is that even possible. Anyone have
&gt; any ideas.  thanks
