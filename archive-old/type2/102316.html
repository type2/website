Subject: Need an engine will trade tranny or 2-1700s

Alright I am tired of dinking with this 1700 pancake engine! So I am looking for a good ole simple RUNNING 1600 DP within a 2 hour drive of Cincinnati, Ohio. I will either buy it from you outright, or I will trade you 2 complete 1700 pancake style engines for it. One of the 1700's is completely assembled, turns freeely, but has low compression of 80-70-60-80.  The other is completely dis-assembled in boxes with a very nice case that apparently has been hot-dipped or something because it is very clean. Both have complete tin-ware.  I also have a 3 rib Tranny for 68-74 bus that I can trade for an engine.


Peace, John Baker
