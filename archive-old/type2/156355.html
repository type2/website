Subject: Help for a Newbie

Hi folks. Since it's Friday I'll take advantage and introduce myself.  I'm Dave &quot;Busahaulic&quot; Pearson - those who frequent RAMVA have seen me  there for years. First the questions:
  
  Never done a &quot;List&quot; before and am having some problems figuring stuff  out. I get all these e-mails in no particular order and no reference to  anything previous as in a thread. Is that because I have something  &quot;set&quot; wrong? (Firefox and Yahoo webmail)
  
  I saw how to post, but how do I reply? If I simply select &quot;Reply&quot; it  should only go to the sender... Do I need to cc Type2 in my replies?
  
  I've had a 79, &quot;Bussy&quot; for about 15 years. It was in the ash plume of  Mt St Helens when new and all the double body panels filled with ash  which ground away any rust preventative that was there. When I bought  it, it moved to the &quot;wet&quot; side of the state where the ash became a  sponge and probably an electrolyte. Anyway, body is rapidly  disappearing! Have a new (74) body ready to start work on.
  
  I travel a lot between Seattle area and Oregon Coast and have been  through several 2L engines just because I pushed 'em too hard for too  long. Gave up after 5 and stuck a 2.2 Subey in there.
  Check out my albums (always changing) at photos.yahoo_dot_com/busahaulic01
  
  As soon as I figure this replying stuff out, I'll be comin' back atcha wenever I have appropriate input.
