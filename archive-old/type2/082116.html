&lt;&lt; IMHO organized bus racing would be interesting, but I 
can't help thinkning that if it really caught on and 
went big time that it might have a negative effect on 
price and availability of parts.

Some place down South (it would be...), has an annual &quot;bus&quot; race...Not
type 2's but clapped out school busses on a figure 8 dirt track...I'm
not sure about the flashing light rules in this particular situation, 
though...;-(
