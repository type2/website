Subject: Mine's out, too!!

Went back outside to work on pulling my engine, lame hand and all. While 
screwing withe heat echanger control boxes, I heard the familar sound of a 
wasp (see Re: Progress and life) and saw not one, but two... I got out from 
underneath there so fast, that I knocked over my tool kit, which in turn 
knocked over the fire extiguisher, thus setting it off. White powder 
everywhere but luckily none near the bus. After another game of cat and mouse 
with the wasps, I finally got them. First with bug spray, then with liquid 
wrench, then a final coat of rustoleum gloss black - any animal lovers, 
please forgive me - it was getting personal. After that, things went very 
smooth. And now, my engine is out, resting comfortably behind the bus... but 
it looks like rain. Some days, I think I should have my own theme music.
