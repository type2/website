I think we may both be right here, if we are speaking of the port just
below the carb base on the manifold.

If he's talking about a port off to the far left of the manifold, nono! Or
closer to the bottom of the neck, either.:)

This port may have been put on to facilitate the use of other, earlier,
carbs that didnt have the port for the retard. 

OTOH, all the information I found said the carb was the correct place, and
never mentioned the manifold...But that doesnt mean anything.:)

Either one should work, in reality.

later...david
