Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Seized

At 09:25 AM 7/15/2002 -0700, Jim told a sorry tale:

&gt;Brand new Type 1 engine in a 71 Bus, about 350 miles.  I built it myself,
&gt;and it was running great...... Friday night I
&gt;drove it on the freeway for the first time, and it ran great for about 35
&gt;miles, then I started seeing a drop of oil pressure, from about 50PSI to
&gt;20PSI, then it fluctuated up and down between 20 and 40 PSI.  This lasted
&gt;about 10 miles, and I figured it was a bad connection on the oil pressure
&gt;sender or something like that.  Suddenly, my oil pressure dropped to 0PSI,
&gt;and I still figured it was a bad connection, so I kept driving the last 5
&gt;miles home......

The following is not intended as Monday Morning Quarterbacking, but as
a heads-up to others out there.........

If you must install an oil pressure gauge, please install the pressure sender
IN ADDITION TO, NOT IN PLACE OF the stock, idiot-light sender.  That way,
if you don't believe what the gauge says, or it malfunctions, you still 
have the
idiot-light to save your ass, poor engine, marriage, etc.

Note to Jim:
Don't be discouraged by this somewhat expensive lesson.  ONWARDS!  UPWARDS!
Persevere in lifting yourself above the mortgage-your-life-to-have-a-car 
mindset
shovelled out by the marketing lackeys, of the new car manufacturers!  You are
the mechanic in charge!  If your SO doesn't like that, then just buy her a 
nice bicycle
to ride.
