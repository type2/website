&gt; sorry if this is more bug related, but i did lose a bunch of very hard to
&gt; find splitty westy parts as well.
&gt; rachel's bug was parked in the corner spot in the church parking lot at
the
&gt; corner of 17th and adams, catty-corner to and visible from the octo show
&gt; (which was great except for the car getting lifted). it had a repro bug
&gt; woodslat rack on it, and the framework for a westy rack attached to the
bug
&gt; rack. the rest of the disassembled westy rack was inside the car, covered
&gt; up, as well as a box of 55/56 westy parts (in a girl scout cookie box), a
&gt; digital camera, some of our clothes and 2 jackets/coats, a repop hazet
&gt; tooklit (empty) which was won at the octo raffle, a new wiring works bug
&gt; harness was in the trunk, as well as all of rachel's id, credit cards,
&gt; etc... plus some other misc vw parts. there is no front license plate on
&gt; the car (yes, she knows), which may be a good way to spot it. we are also
&gt; going to call the church this morning to see if for some obscure reason
&gt; they had it towed off, but we were somewhat assured that they don't do
that.
&gt; if anyone there saw anything happen to the bug between 11am and 1pm (we
&gt; went back to the car to unload clothes and parts), please call the
&gt; huntington beach police (714-960-8811), or please email me. please check
&gt; out the link to see pics.
&gt; a big thanks to P &amp; C and Roger Nang for all their help yesterday.
