Hubby has been running a compufire in his bug for probably upwards of 8
years (unless I am mistaken) and he's got almost 200,000 miles on that
engine.

they are on both of our vans presently.  We just changed the distributor
on my van to the stock one and our freeway milage jumped to 22mpg, from
a barely 18.   we like the electronic ignitions.

Don't know about the coil, but we never changed the coils in the '71
vans. 

What is an &quot;ant tip?&quot;

 Hey everybody. Been thinking about going with Compu-Fire &quot;pointless&quot;
ignition. (I will keep the points, etc in the tool box just in case.) I
 have a 1600 DP with an 009, and a Bosch Blue Coil. Questions:
 1) Anybody want to venture pro's or con's about Compu-Fire?
 2) Will the Blue Coil be sufficent? 
 3) If anyone who is reading this has done this, ant tips, tricks?
