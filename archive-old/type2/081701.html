OK,

Planning a summer trip for me and my girls in my '70 westy (the wife is =
very hesitant about the dependability of the bus).  Plan on taking three =
weeks in August and see what I see with no final ultimate destination =
other then to arrive back at home.  I live in the San Francisco bay area =
and hope to see the Grand Canyon, Jelly Stone Park, &amp; Mt. Rushmore, also =
would like to drive the coastal route between Canada and California.

Any suggestions, hints, advice, must see - can't miss.  I'm talking =
about both generic travel plans as well as Type 2 specifics (you know =
I'll be traveling with my A.I.R.S. list).

Any words of wisdom would be greatly appreciated,


Juan
