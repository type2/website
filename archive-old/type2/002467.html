Hey list. Hope everyone is having a good weekend.

I have finally received my Eberspacher BN4 heater and am getting ready to
bench test it and install it. I still need a couple of things if anybody has
them for sell or some alternative suggestions:   the recirculating vent and
tube that goes above the driver's side rear wheel. I have the white plastic
from the heater up to the fresh air intake, but not the metal? or the
plastic vent. I also am not sure how to intall these.  I also need the
switch or knob to turn on the heater. I know some came with a timer  too. I
have the metal ducting that comes up under my z-bed, but not the venting or
plastic vent. Has anybody else played around with a different way of putting
heat to the front of the bus or another ducting system? Lastly I need the
cable to regulate heat from under the driver's seat or a good alternative.

I have read and re-read the library articles from Ron and Casper, but didn't
see any &quot;patterns&quot; they refer to. If anyone has any info on installing the
BN4 I would love to know!!

Thanks a bunch.
