Subject: Re: [T2] fuel gauge problems

Classic symptom of a bad sender - the little wires have worn through.  New 
senders are available but replacing them is Not Fun (tm).  See the archives 
at http://www.type2_dot_com for lots of chatter on this subject.

&gt;Hi everyone
&gt;I've been having problems with the fuel gauge on my 74 Westy.  The sending
&gt;unit seems to be fine but I could be wrong.  It works when I fill up with
&gt;gas but after I've gone about 15 miles it drops to empty.  Any ideas?
