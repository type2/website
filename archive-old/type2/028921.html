An oil leak can be caused by having too much oil in the crank case.

Also your dip stick can mislead you into thinking you have too much or too
little oil. The bottom of the sump on a VW flat four is a large flat
square(ish) shape and the oil in it is not very deep; so any slight slope or
camber in a road will significantly effect the level of the oil shown on the
dip stick.

When doing a oil change park in your usual spot, then put in the correct
measured amount of oil as shown in your handbook/Bentley manual, then (after
its settled) use the dip stick to see what level the correct amount of oil
shows while parked in our usual spot. This will give you a reference for oil
checks while parked in your usual spot.

If you also dip the oil while parked on different slopes and cambers you
will soon get a feel of what the correct oil level looks like with the
engine at different angles.

Without saying what sort of engine you have, or which side of the car the
steering wheel is fitted its not possible to suggest likely leak points;
except that oil can leak from the rocker cover or pushrod tubes on both
sides of either type of engine.

The origin of an oil leak can be found by cleaning all the old oil off, then
after a short drive inspect the engine to find where the leak is starting.

good luck

I have a major leak of oil on the driver's side I need to investigate.

The dipstick has consistently read high, by 1/4 to 1/2 of the overall
range width.

I also think the back of my buss has bad springs, or shocks or
something, because it looks like it sits low, so it gives me the
impression I am level, when maybe I am not.

If there is too much oil in my westy, could that be why I am
leaking? too much oil pressure? and if so, should I dump some out?

perterbed,
