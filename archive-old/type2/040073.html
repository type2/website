Subject: Perfect Propane Heater for Bus

Well, I know it's the wrong season to bring this up, but I just ran across 
what looks like the perfect portable propane heater for our busses. Go to 
www.mrheater_dot_com The unit is called the &quot;Buddy&quot;, small, portable and safe for 
indoor use, (they say it was designed for use in tents and RV's, ect.) puts 
out 4000-9000btu's, runs on a 1lb cylinder, or can be hooked into a 20lb 
bottle with an adaptor. Has an oxygen depletion/CO2 auto cut-off, and sells 
for about $100.00 I'm gonna order one when they become available, which 
should be in Aug. Please check it out!
