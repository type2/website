&gt; How do you monitor it? Additional pressure gages?

As teachers are often heard saying &quot;A very good question!&quot;

A pressure guage on the gallery side of the bypass valve would probably
give some information that you could interpret.  Another, more direct,
way is to modify the &quot;big screw&quot; valve cover to incorporate a switch
activated by the movement of the bypass valve.
