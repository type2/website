Subject: 1st Time owner...asking questions

First of all I'd like to say thanks to all who have givin me advice on
what to check and do.  I'm taking it all into consideration.

My question tonight is...

I have the John Muir book and I'm planning on doing all the items he
suggests to do in the maintance chapter.

Valve Adjustment
Adjust Points
Timing
Vacuum Advance
Oil Change
Spark Plugs
Coil

So I'm trying to prepare my bus for her madden voyage and is this a good
place to start??  Can you suggest anything else that I might want to
tackle??

Thanks again

Jeff
