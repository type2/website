Subject: Re: Bleeding Brakes 

So James L. McGill says:
&gt; CARVER_JEFFREY} make solo bleeding a lot easier.  
&gt; 
&gt; Everyone says &quot;a lot easier&quot;, but I'm wondering how it would even be &quot;possible&quot;
&gt; without a special tool.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm on a pretty depressing adventure still, and all I need to do to my bus 
&gt; is bleed the brakes.  The bleeder valve is broken off in the wheel cylinder,
&gt; way too deep to get it out.  The wheel is attached to the hub with a 46mm
&gt; nut, and nobody seems to sell a 46mm socket :-(  Except mail order, and harbor
&gt; freight just sent me a letter that said they could not fill my order...
&gt; NAPA told me they had a 1 13/16, but when I got to the store I found out
&gt; they lied.  Sears has a 3/4&quot; set that they sell for $200, which might be a 
&gt; good investment.
&gt; 

Ummm.... You don't have *any* VW for foreign auto parts houses?  You 
can usually find them there.  There are a few VW shops here in town
that would carry that size socket.  I could pick one up for you if
you're interested.
