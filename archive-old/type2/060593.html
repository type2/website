Sorry gang I sorta went off!!  But what started out as a harmless topic (which
btw was started by yours truly) has gotten way outta hand.  I started the
topic basically to see what other types of VW's we all owned besides are
beloved buses.  I was hope'n to run across some other closet type 4 owners,
but alas I only ran across one flaming type 3 owner.  I enjoyed the posts, I
thought the folks that included their lawn mowers to rather humorous.  But
enough is enough.  I am deeply sorry for venting in my last post, but because
I own 15 VWs it does not make me greedy, insane, or a dribbler!  It just makes
me a guy with a very big yard that just happens to love VW's.
  Peace, Love, and again my apologies,
     Mr. Bubble Head
PS  if this is what's gonna happen with harmless Friday topics--all hell sure
break loose with what's in your parcel tray!!!!
