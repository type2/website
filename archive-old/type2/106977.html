Subject: looking for engine still...2.0L

Hey folks,
I know I've posted several time about finding a
replacement engine for my beloved bus Anya. (1978 with
2.0 FI).

So far I havnt really found anything so I'm just
throwing it out there again. Any help appreciated. If
you've seen one in a junkyard, heard of one somewhere,
have a perfectly running one that your willing to
donate (what you could be a saint...) or any of the
other possible scenarios, please shoot me an email.

Thanks 

Giles, on behalf of one hurting little bus.
