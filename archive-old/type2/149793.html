Subject: Silly lock question

I just received 2 new handles and locks for the 70, and much to my dismay
they require 2 different keys.  If I was to put them on I would need 3
different keys just for the doors.  Seems there is a black hole when it
comes to locks for a 70.  How do I get just one key to work on all 3?

Thanks, Nik
