Last time I knew someone who ran into this problem, it was resolved much like 
another friend with a pinto with a missing smog part... You could buy it (in 
this case a nozzle restrictor) from the smog referee's station... at a 
grossly overinflated price (the &quot;heat stove&quot; for the pinto was $49 (not 
surprising when you learn her total before being smog exempt could not be 
more than $50) and consisted of parts she could have gotten at a flaps for 
about $4.00)... Lessee, I think the total for '79 is $250 now... wanna bet it 
costs more than $100 for this?  Of course, they'll tell you it has to be 
theirs only, as it's the only one approved, etc.etc...

I think I would try a locking gas cap first, and don't hang around while they 
do the test... what they can't see they may pass you on (I got my hall unit 
OK'd like that - they ck'd the timing, spot on, but didn't pop the dist. 
cap)...  Also try a flaps for the insert... or if you're really creative, fab 
one yourself.

And yes, I hate the new SmogChek II program... I think (IMHO) it's an 
organized ripoff of the people of the state of California.

yourself.  Abuse no one and nothing, for abuse turns the wise ones into fools 
and robs the spirit of it's vision.
