Had a similar problem with my van (1974, 1600 motor)where it would let a 
large backfire and then refuse to run, merely to turn over.  It turned out 
that the distributor was jumping up a millimeter or two in its hole in the 
block.  This is turn caused the distributor cam to turn uselessly with no 
drive.  The problem was solved firstly by pushing the distributor back home 
(after pushing the van back home:-)) and secondly by purchasing a new 
distributor clamp, which wasn't warped by heat and time.  Hope this helps 
you in your dilemna.

john!
