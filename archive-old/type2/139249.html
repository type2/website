Subject: RE: [T2]oil coming from dipstick ????

jb weld on the inside of the metal tube for dipstick tube...??
 
JB Weld?  What would Dr. Tim say?
There must be a correct gasket or &quot;O&quot; ring for this application.
Is there a crankcase vent that goes to the intake, is it open or clogged
with oil/carbon?
I miss Doktor Tim's advice.
