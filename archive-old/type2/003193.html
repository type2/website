   Hi All,

I got my new engine stand for Christmass and now have my engine, 1600dp from
my 70 Westy, sitting on the stand, partialy dissasembled and awaiting new
P&amp;C's. My question is, how much clearence should the rod side to the
crankshaft be?. I can not wiggle the rod up and down, but can side to side.
I do not want to spend the money on the top end if the bottom end is NG.
Thanks in advance.

Jeff
