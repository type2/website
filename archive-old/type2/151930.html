&gt; i am thinking to myself should i spend the extra money
&gt; and get a lockable gas cap and lockable engine lid

not sure if Ron has any more but I got one from him at bus depot a few
years back....not the  greatest cap but works.

I debated for some time about engine comp lid, but if I ever need to get
to the engine in a hurry for whatever reason, esp fire I don't want to
waste seconds on a lock....

YMMV
