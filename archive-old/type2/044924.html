Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [T2] steering box recommendation

Actually, bus boys and wolfgang both recommend a thicker lube for
steering boxes, not to alleviate play, but to retard leakage.

Not much play can be adjusted out of the boxes.  If it's really
that bad, then buck up and have it rebuilt, or find a good used one.
