... Here's a couple:
 
ACVW_at_egroups_dot_com - subscribe at the egroups web
site. 
 
VintagVW_at_listproc.sjsu_dot_edu - If you send an e-mail
to listproc_at_listproc.sjsu_dot_edu, it will return an
e-mail telling you how to subscribe. This is a great
list.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Does anyone know of a list where he could possibly
&gt; &gt; get some answers to his
&gt; &gt; questions?  Maybe some of you would like to talk
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; him &quot;off list&quot;.  His
