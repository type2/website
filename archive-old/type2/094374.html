It's all Metric.  To bolt on the exhaust you can use non-metric hardware if
you want.  Stainless Steel hardware will allow you to remove everything
later.  Although it's a lower grade bolt it strong enough.

&gt; If the exhaust gaskets are

It's the same rule for any gasket. Fit a cheap new one on now and increase
the interval when you'll have to replace it next.

&gt; preserving exhaust parts &amp; heat exchangers?

I believe you can paint the exhaust but it is very tricky and my first
attempt failed.

You need paint that can withstand 1500F. You need to apply one good light
coat only.  Find a paint brand like VHT that says to run the engine for 5
minutes to get up to temperature and let it cool on it's own to cure.  I
once followed the instructions for one brand and drove for 30 mins. The next
day the paint bubbled and flaked off.

Mufflers rust out from the inside anyway...
