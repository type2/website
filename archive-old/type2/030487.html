there might be a bit of an international misunderstanding here...

I dont think the US market ever got the kind of highroof you have in
finland.  You are probably thinking of a factory made steel highroof.  We
have none of those in the states unless they were imported from another
country.  There may be some pre 67 ones, but i doubt there were ever any
post 67 ones here. (unless someone dragged one back from europe...)

the kinds of highroof busses that i think he is referring to are where a
regular bus had the roof cut out and a fiberglass camper style high roof
was added.  They are somewhat uncommon, but i have seen quite a few in my
bussing days... There used to be a 74 or 75 that lived just down the
street from me.

hopefully this clarifies the &quot;highroof&quot; confusion.  Maybe we should call
the fiberglass conversion ones something different to avoid confusion with
the factory models for our international friends.  Anyone have any ideas?

peas,

Steve
