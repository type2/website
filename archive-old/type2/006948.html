Rob,

&gt;I'm just about out of ideas on this one, so I turn to your incredible 
&gt;knowledge.

Having just gone through this myself, I would almost guarantee that you 
have a lot of gunk in your fuel tank.  I finally had to pull my tank 
after &quot;flushing&quot; about a cup of rust, dirt, etc. through the line 
manually.  It turned out that once the tank was empty and dry, I was able 
to shake out about another 3 cups of crud.  Then, I used the cleaner from 
a fuel tank repair kit, and through 5 rinses, I was still getting dark 
liquid out - lots of laquer from old gas.  It finally started clearing 
up, then I used the acid three times, which loosened another several cups 
of rust from the side walls.  I use the fuel tank sealer when it was 
clean and smooth, and hopefully, I will never have to do this again.  
She's running sweet again, and I kick myself for fighting through the 
hesitation for 6 months before biting the bullet and cleaning the tank.  
Talk about hard driving - I probably took a few years off my engine with 
the fuel starvation coughs at freeway speed.
