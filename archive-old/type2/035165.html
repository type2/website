Subject: thermostat problems

Volks,

   I installed a new thermostat and cable and pulled the flaps closed and 
connected the wire, I double checked the second time( it happened twice) that 
it was on the pulley b4 attaching my tin. I drive it 20 mins to work and the 
damn wire comes off the pulley and the flaps are wide open. I cant figure 
this out. Has anyone had a similar problem or suggestions ?

   Thankyou,
   Runnin cool in CO
