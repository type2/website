Subject: Re: [T2] rebuild 2.0l

&gt; &gt; You'll notice with VW hydraulic grinds the available lifts are much
&gt; &gt;lower then with solids, because they have to be so much milder on the on/off
&gt; &gt;valve seat events with hydraulic lifters, &lt;snip&gt;
and
&gt; Why do they have to be so much milder on/off the seat?

'On/off valve seat events' is called ramp speed.
Lift and duration has nothing to do with ramp speed.
Ramp speed has to be slower on hydraulic lifter cams, mainly on the valve closing side. If it is too fast, the
lifter will float and pump up. The lifter cannot follow the cam and have a gap between it and the cam. Oil
pressure then pumps up the lifter and the valve stays open.  This will happen way before redline is hit.
