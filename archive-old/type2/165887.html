Subject: Re: [T2] Re: theorerectially looking for hypthesis(dropped
  exhaust valve?)

okay, pulled off the rockers and pulled out the pushrod tubes, then
inserted a magnet to pull out what should be a solid lifter in my 75
FI auto engine.  the lifter had some play but i could not remove it.
this was the #4 exhaust.  this is the one with the rocker arm with 1/4
inch play when i went to adjust the valves.  so, i checked the #4
intake.  same thing.  lifter had play but would not come out of the
pushrod tube.  do i need to keep on trying and jiggle the magnet to
try to lift the lifter over a lip at the end of the pushrod tube?

okay, again.  looked online a little and found some pics of lifters
solid and hydraulic.  appears i did not try hard enough, so i will try
again in a bit to pull out the lifters.  i'm still leaning towards a
valve seat that fell out and is now improperly wedged in the
combustion chamber bashing the hell out of the piston.  may be wishful
thinking but that is what happened before on the #1 intake valve.

thanks, to everyone.
