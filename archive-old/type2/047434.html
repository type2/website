Subject: Re: [T2] Exhaust studs and heat exchangers

&gt;I can't imagine that you could drill out the threads larger than 10mm.  I 
&gt;think you would end up too close to your exhaust port.

Steve is 100% right on this, even overdrilling to 10mm is pushing it on
T4 exhaust studs, remember the design was originally spaced for an 8mm
stud, then the 9mm was a fix.  Personally if I have to do this, I do one of
two things, either way overdrill to M10x1.25 then use a 8mm helicoil or use
a bug repair stud in 8 x 10 mm of appropriate length.  But I'm more inclined
to bite the bullet on a good head and pay my local welder $15-20 to TIG up
the hole after I grind it out for him, then go ahead and redrill and retap
if the
damage was severe.

Something else, solid inserts of various manufacture are made in both the
ways mentioned, ones where you drive tabs to lock (on the surface OR down
in the insert) and ones that are tapered to lock.  I don't know that any
particular
design works better, tapered are likely not to leak fluid, but when subject to
NVH may be more likely to workout with time, the driven tabs are pretty much
in there good.  I thought genuine Time-serts were the tab style, but don't
really recall.  We used both styles routinely at the rocket factory in
aluminum
parts, specced largely on whose catalog the design engineer or the draftsman
happened to have on his desk, nothing more.  Either are better than helicoils
but are unfortunately a larger form factor, helicoils were relegated more for
corrosion prevention and vibration isolation like I assume VW uses them
for in the T4 mounting bolt holes.

Another related question, is the thread on the 8 x 12mm solid insert then a
M12x1.25?  I was hoping to use them in the T4 case with bug cromoly
studs without having to drill and tap, but this would negate the idea.
