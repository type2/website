You're not looking in the right place, or for the right thing.

What you're trying to find, is a little plastic bulb holder
that mounts in the back of the instrument cluster.  There will
be several of them--for the gen./alt., oil, and high beam warning
lights, and some for instrument illumination.  Dealing with all of
this is much easier if you have the cluster pulled out of the dash,
but that requires first pulling the steering wheel.  Contacts corrode
and bulbs burn out--that's the nature of the thirty-odd year old beast.

Have you verified power to the instrument cluster illuminator lamps
at the headlight switch?  The variable resistor that controls illuminator
lamp brightness is likely to be shot.  Just connect the wire for the
illuminator lamps to the hot side of the variable resistor--that way
the lamps will be all the way bright whenever the headlights are on.
This is where I always have mine set, anyway.

You didn't mention whether these lamps ever worked, in your experience.
Perhaps the bulb housings and/or bulbs aren't even there.  Anything is
possible, with the mental state of many of the POs out there..........
