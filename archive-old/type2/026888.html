Subject: changing out front end

Hi all,
I have a 1979 bus with a rusty front end (the whole support of the front 
wheels to the body).  The support on the left side that holds the torsion 
bar is rusted and the hosing for the shock absorber is rusted.  It was 
recommended that I get a whole new front end from a demolition yard and 
replace mine.  I have found one for $275.  The question is how hard will it 
be to remove and replace my front end.

Thanks
Bo
