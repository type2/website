Hi List,

  I have a question on timing the distributor, crankshaft and the
camshaft.  I think I understand how to do this, but I'm not sure.

  We should align the distributor so that it points to the notch, by
rotating the crankshaft which is temporarily placed in the case,
indicating that it is in the #1 position.  Once we do this, we will rotate
it 90 degrees, and remove the crankshaft.  Next, we install the crankshaft
and the camshaft together, with the two-notch mark on the crankshaft
pointing to the bottom of the case, and matching up with the one-notch
mark on the camshaft.  Now, with this in, when we rotate the crankshaft up
to top-dead-center, the camshaft and the crankshaft will be properly
aligned, and the distributor will point to the #1 position mark.  Is this
procedure okay/correct?

  All help is appreciated.

    Wade
