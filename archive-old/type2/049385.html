Subject: Re:[T2] what carbs Webers, or Kadrons

The webers might be too small for your engine. At high speed it 
might not get enough mixture and run lean which would be bad for 
the engine. Unless you want to rejet the carbs. I have dual kadrons 
40 on my 73 (1700 type IV) . I suggest you to try them both and 
see how the engine feels at all speed. If you have more backfire 
through the exhause you will know that you need more gas. But 
then I am partial to kadrons because they are cheap, simple to 
maintain and easy to get parts. Just my opinion.
