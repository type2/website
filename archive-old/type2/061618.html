Subject: GVWR

GVWR stands for gross vehicle weight rating.  That means the maximum weight
that the vehicle is designed to support while driving.  Many things
determine this rating, like capacity of the tires, suspension, frame, the
ability of the brakes to stop a given mass, etc.  The rating includes
everything in and on the vehicle including people, fuel, cargo, and
everything!  It does not include the total weight of a trailer, just the
tongue weight.  The rating that includes all of the trailer is the GCVWR, or
gross combined vehicle weight rating.  I don't know when this rating, GCVWR,
came into use.  I've never seen it on an older vehicle, just newer ones.
goforit! &amp; MERRY CHRISTMAS ALL !!!!
