Gary, others have answered 1-5 or I don't know the answer (I'm not a CA
native, only an occasional visitor :-), but here is what I know:

&gt; 6.  I'm going to pull the engine w/ the tranny and replace tranny seals and
&gt; shift bushings.  Where is the CG on the engine/tranny assembly?

it is 3-6&quot; to the rear of the engine trans junction.  Further forward than
you might think, but I think the flywheel is the key weight factor and it
is in the bell housing, forward of the junction.

&gt; 7.  I'm guessing it would be easier to remove exhaust components before
&gt; dropping the motor?  I don't want to bend them.

It is *HUGELY* easier to get the exhaust components off with the engine in
the bus!!!!  Once you drop the engine, it will be sitting on them, unless
you have a stand, in which case I might reconsider (but I don't have a
stand)
