Subject: Pushrod tube seals + silicone

Someone said that they 'use silicone' when installing new pushrod tube 
seals.

I ask, is this the clear, fluid, slippery kind of silicone, or is it the 
Blue RTV gunky sealer kind of silicone??

(I load the valve cover gaskets up with the Blue RTV silicone to stop the 
leaks, and installing the seals with the Blue RTV stuff is a logical 
progression of thought, so this is only a dumb question, not a stupid 
question.)
