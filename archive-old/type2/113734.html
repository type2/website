Subject: Re: [T2] Intake Manifold Stud - liquid thread repair

Lock-tite brand also offers a thread replacement package. It is in liquid 
form and sets up to leave a hard ceramic type thread inside the stripped hole.

Now I'm a cynic and a skeptical one at that but I have a front cam chain 
tensioner on my motorcycle ('81 CB900C) that has been repaired with this 
for several YEARS now. That repaired hole is on the front of the engine on 
the head so it gets HOT. Still holding up...

Might be worth the $10 or so to try it...
