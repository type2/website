Subject: Re: [T2] GL4 vs. GL5

CORRECTION:  I should have written 'gear oil', rather than 'hypoid oil'.

VW specified 30,000 mile intervals for changing the &gt;hypoid oil&lt; in 
their air cooled vehicles.

Personally, I believe that more often is better.  I like to change it 
every other time I change my motor oil.  If it extends the life of the 
tranny, it will be well worth it.
