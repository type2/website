Hi Everybody!!

I've been on and off of this list for a while, it's good to be back again.

I wanted to put out the word that my dear friend, Jethro, is going to have
to be sold.

He's a 1977 Bus, fully automatic trans, 2L engine, great body and interior.
I blew his head one night trying to get a friend to the airport on time.
Where I live in Salt Lake City, I cannot keep him, and I know Betsy, his '87
sis, is gonna miss him.

I'm asking $650

I want him to go to a good home.

Thanks,

Don Preston
