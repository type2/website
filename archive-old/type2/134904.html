&gt; Throw that thing in the trash and buy a new starter.
&gt; They add insult to injury. Seriously look at your starter and how it is
&gt; wired and ask yourself what a soliniod is and why you would need another
&gt; one. When ever I see these things I *&amp;%#$ rip them out.
&gt; I knew a guy that killed himself doing that. Seriously

Joe,

I tend to try the inexpensive fixes first.  I'm also 48 years old and have a
brain.  I've got more sense than to ever get under any vehicle to work on
the starting system, with it in gear and not chocked to prevent movement.
Sorry to hear about your bud.

I'll check out the relay kit to make sure I have it hooked up correctly.
Then I'll test the starter.

You need to reconsider your &quot;bedside&quot; manner, &quot;Doc&quot;.  Seriously.
