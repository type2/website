&gt;&gt; After starting up the engine and returning from a test drive I

&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; There's lots of pressure in the crankcase. That's why a breather is
&gt; needed. By kinking the hose you sealed up the case and possibly blew
&gt; seals.
&gt;
&gt; Vent outside the engine compartment. Pick up one of those breather
&gt; filters like the hotrodders use to keep from putting too much oil
&gt; vapors into the environment.
&gt;
&gt; But the best solution would be to drill a hole in one of the air
&gt; filter housings and install a nipple as John said. Or you could get a
&gt; plactic pcv filter from a flaps for a couple bucks to put inside the
&gt; air cleaner with the nipple sticking out of a hole in the housing.
&gt; That is my first choice and what I plan to do with my 71 with dual
&gt; webers.
