Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Oil on Concrete Garage Floor

I suggest a product that has peat moss in it,,, Clay is a problem &lt;kitty
litter&gt; to dispose of.

I think this describes it very well...

I am pretty sure the product we use at work for large oil spills is
'zorball', but I'll have to wait till monday to read the packaging

&gt; My personal favorite is 409 sprayed and wiped....

&gt; Anything that will emulsify or absorb(like kitty litter)the oil/grease is
&gt; good.
