Well, the short form would be pull the top, set it on workhorses, sand the
bad area down, lay down some fiberglass mat and resin and sand till finished
8 (
More realistic would be are there any boat shops,surf shops, corvette dudes
around your area? Its probably not a real big job and removing and
delivering the top to them would be half the battle. Gotta excuse the
regionalisim, I'm used to pull a part yards where I see too many camp
outfits destroyed and sent to the crusher. Maybe another listee heading your
way with a bus in tow? I know most of those tops have gone for less than
$100 and most get tossed anyways

&gt; I only wish that in this part of the country there were wrecking yards
with
&gt; old VWs. But we are in Omaha, Nebraska and there was one here last year
that
