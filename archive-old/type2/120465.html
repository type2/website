Subject: Re: [T2] Burned Valves: Why?

I think what you have is a bad case of dirty engine,
take all the tin off and clean the cylinders heads and
oil cooler real good. Get a oil temp gage and keep
your temp under 210 F., put an external oil cooler on
it if you have to. The only way a valve seat sinks is
to overheat the engine, and you can do that in a 100
mile trip. You need to check to make sure that you
didn't gaul the pistons and cyl's in the process of
overheating the engine. Let me know what you find..
Phil
