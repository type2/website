I fitted a 52mm (2&quot;diameter) rev-counter in the clock gap, and it didn't
look too clever because it's too small. But its probably better than hacking
a hold in the dashboard (if I were to do it all over again, I'd make a
custom instrument panel with loads of them in).

Yes, you can get a dual gauge, in fact they are not too unusual. Demon
Tweeks on the Wrexham Industrial Estate, Wales, UK (tel +44 1978 664468) do
a good selection of lines in instruments, they're not cheap though (for the
dual ones).

Yeah, pressure is more important if you had to choose only one.

Happy gauge-reading!

&gt; From this post, I guess I am announcing to everyone my return from
&gt; being away for a month in Trinidad and then St. Croix.
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, now the Houston weather is right for some serious bus work, and
&gt; I want to get started on a few issues.
&gt;
&gt; A couple of questions:
&gt; Oil pressure gauges and Oil temperature gauges.
&gt; Mounting in a 1970 Westy using the clock hole
&gt;
&gt; First off, I would like to monitor both parameters, but given a choice,
&gt; I guess I would go with pressure as the most important !?  Correct
&gt; ??  Comments ??
&gt;
&gt; Now then, given the clock hole in the dash, what is the best gauge
&gt; model # to go with for either oil pressure or temperature ?
&gt;
&gt; Now then, bigger question yet..................
&gt; Does anybody out there make a dual function gauge that fits in the
&gt; clock hole so as to allow for measuring oil temp and oil pressure at
&gt; same time??
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for reading,
&gt; Bob in Houston
