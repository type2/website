&lt;&lt; I live in florida and was wondering how do you become a mechanic that

on old vws and get paid to do it.

Well, the guy from Apex Technical School won't be calling you back...
Best bet at this stage is to find a local shop that'll take you on as
an apprentice/gofer and learn as much as you can. Not to dissuade
you from this, but you do realize that AC VW mechanics are work-
ing on an inverted pyramid of available vehicles...Everytime some-
one on the list offers a parts car/bus, that's one less that you
could work on for a living...They ain't makin' anymore of 'em so
the available pool shrinks day by day...That said, I wish you luck.
You might try a local vocational school, BTW, there may well be
a teacher left who is familiar with VW's...It's a shot... ;-(
