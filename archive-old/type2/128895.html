Subject: Removing a late-bay ignition lock cylinder

Hi Volks,

I am working on a local bus (1977 Auto westy) that has had a history of 
starting problems. This bus is in EXTREMELY  good condition 
cosmetically and mechanically, but suffers from a few very minor 
quirks.  The P.O. disconnected the heat and someone has bypassed the 
starter wiring with a huge pushbutton on the dash and a bosch relay on 
the starter. Other than those two minor flaws the bus is very near 
perfect. I was referred to the computer-challenged owner by an 
out-of-town VW specialist, as there aren't a lot of shops in the 
Toronto area that will take on this kind of work that know anything 
about buses. It's kind of nice working on one in such excellent 
condition for a change.

On my first look at the bus I determined that the starter was bad. It 
was heavily corroded all over and when I put a 13mm socket on the main 
terminal the bakelight assembly around the terminal broke away. When 
spun with a known good battery the starter was very slow. So we 
installed a reman bosch starter and things got better... but only a 
bit.

The second problem was that there were no dash lights with the key on, 
and the bus would not turn over or start. I was able to fix this with a 
bit of temporary chicanery under the engine lid, and determined that 
the ignition switch should be replaced in order to get the push button 
off the dash. Installing a replacement switch has fixed both issues. 
Kind of.

The replacement switch worked fine when plugged into the wiring harness 
and turned with a screwdriver. But as it turns out, so does the 
original switch. When the switch is installed in the lock cylinder it 
does not function. This tells me that the lock cylinder was the problem 
all along. The key action is not very good, and the key seems to stop 
just short of where it should be engaging the starter. I'm told by a 
third party that the bus has had ignition key issues in the recent 
past. Seeing the push-button on the dash made me think the problem was 
electrical, but it has turned out to be  mechanical. Go figure.

The mechanical part in this case is $5 cheaper than the electrical 
part, though it will cost more to re-key it if the owner wants to stay 
with a single key.

So how do I get the ignition cylinder out of the housing? Last time I 
asked how to get the switch out and I got an excellent response... Now 
I'm hoping there's as good an answer to this question.


Happy trails,
