Subject: Re: [T2] Front Shift Bushing Replacement

[...]

I just did this today on my 77. Took me all of 5 minutes!
Put in 1st or 3rd.
Remove square head bolt on coupling at end of front tube.
Slide tube forward off end of middle section.
Lower end and move tube to the rear. The shifter will follow it.
Rotate the tube just enough for the end to clear the hole where the bushing
goes.
Install new bushing.
A word of advice: get the correct bushing. It is part # 211 711 182   It is
NOT the split 111 bug bushing.
Fill the inside of the bushing with grease.
Rotate tube back thru the new bushing and put it back on the end of the tube.
Install bolt and safety wire it.
Piece of cake!



&gt; All this talk about shift couplers and bushings and such has my mind on one
&gt; of my ongoing issues:  ultra-sloppy shifting due to a worn-out and mangled
&gt; front shift bushing (the circular rubber thing).  Anyway, I remember reading
&gt; here once where someone was able to replace this bushing without having to
&gt; mess with also removing the shifter apparatus from the floor above; he said
&gt; he was able to move the front section of the shift rod (separated from the
&gt; rear section) far enough back to slip the bushing into housing at the front
&gt; of the rod.  I got under and cuss and try as I might, I could not make it
&gt; happen.  I cannot move the front section of the rod far enough back, and I
&gt; don't want to force anything.  Is there anyone else out there who has been
&gt; able to do it this way without removing the shifter and if so, what is the
&gt; secret?  I just don't want to remove the whole shifter assembly, go through
&gt; the mysteries of getting it all back together right, then have my shifting
&gt; end up being even worse (which is what I keep reading here).
&gt;
&gt; Also, if it turns out that I DO need to remove the shifter, is getting it
&gt; all back together right (and being able to shift properly afterwards) really
&gt; as involved and difficult as it sounds?
