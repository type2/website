Well folks its been a loooong time. but tommorow I plan on getting that =
engine in!! I am missing a couple of pieces though I havent been able to =
find them online but if anyone has some leads it'd be greatly =
appreciated:

Piece of shrouding and pipe that connects the passenger side heater box =
to the heater control box.

The connection for the heater tubes to the heat exchangers from the =
fresh fan. (I have the flexible tubing) I need the piece that sits on =
top of the heat exchangers and into the fresh air compartment.

A dipstick. (I had to cut the old one. Dont ask :-(( )

All of these things I will gladly pass a little paypal wealth on for.

Thanks

Tyler
