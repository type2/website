Subject: Re: [T2] oh, woe is me!

&gt; brought it to the shop, they pulled the engine and it was a plug on the
&gt; front of the engine.  Luckily I won't be out of a car for too long.

The dreaded oil gallery plug strikes again!

I got to do one in January. Supposedly they are never suppose to come out -
but they all do eventually. Make sure it gets replaced with an NPT plug and
not just some JB Weld or some such crud...

And you might want to get the others replace too. I think there may be three
on the back of the engine and one or two on the front.

And make sure your clutch disk isn't too wet with oil If so, go ahead and swap
it while the engine is out. The part cost is nothing compared to an engine
drop (unless you are doing it yourself).

-Eric
