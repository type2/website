I do not remember what year it happened, but the latter levers are all
plastic. The early ones are metal with a rubber/plastic knob. The all
plastic ones can be replaced by the early style, but it is a little work.
You need a lever assembly out of an earlier Bus, and may have to remove one
of the extra levers (early had 4, late had 3).

&gt; I was saddened to learn that the old stock on the red heat levers for

&gt; found a couple at Bus Boys last week. After I got mine they only had 4
left

remove
&gt; them. When I got the new ones I greased them up in the hopes of an easier
&gt; removal. The blue ones are still available, but those red and blue levers
&gt; are a big part of the nostalgic look to the dash.
&gt; I know my heater has a lot to be desired, but pulling down on those red
&gt; levers psychologically seem warmer than pulling on all blue ones

Doesn't the entire lever pull out of the dash after you remove a plastic
rivet?  That's the way the '71s work but it might have changed for the
later models.  I never have to pull the rubber tops off of the levers.
