Subject: Re: Ignition problem

Thanks Tim. I called him and told him what you said. He said, &quot;Wow, you
found that out on the internet?&quot; Randy isn't always the brightest bulb but
he's never screwed me. I've known him for 20 years and take jobs to him
that I don't want to mess with or don't have the time to deal with. I
usually know what the solution is myself and give him as much info as I
can. And he's usually available on short notice. For the real challenges I
have to get an appointment 30 days in advance at another shop. Anyhow, I
directed him to deal with the alternator and wiring issues before doing
anything to the ignition.

&gt; Boy, you need to find a mechanic who will not assume that one of many
&gt; things is worth changing as an experiment. If there is a problem with the
&gt; ignition switch, it can be verified with simple testing prior to
&gt; contracting for it's replacement. Find a mechanic is knows and applies
&gt; Bentley diagnostic procedures, or just try swapping parts based upon &quot;best
&gt; guess&quot;. Ignore the best procedures given at the peril of your wallet.
