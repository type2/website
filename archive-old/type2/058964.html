These questions are not just to Dan, but the list in general -- anyone who
might have some idea as to the answers.

Anyone care to speculate what the type of hydraulic lifters are?  I presume
these are from the VW factory?

What components are different in a hydraulic lifter system and the 0 mile
engines that others are selling from Mexico?  Is it easily reverted to solid
lifters, or are the heads different?

Any idea what the compression ratio of these engines are?  I've heard that
the engines sold in Mexico have a pretty low CR but the export ones being
sold by SCAT and others are high, like in TOO HIGH for regular gasoline.
Can anyone confirm this?  Any speculation as to the CR that is in these
engines that BeetleMex is selling?

P.S.  I wrote Dan and he said it was $140 to have his longblock shipped to
Indiana.  I thought that some of the dealers had figured out a way to ship
longblocks via UPS and save some $.  Anyone know if that is indeed an option
for a fully assembled longblock?

Subject: Oil Filter/Mexican Longblock

Being shipped to me tomorrow is a brand new 0-mile
longblock, coming from Nogales AZ. via Beetlemex (who
comes highly recommended).  The engine costs $980. and
has hydraulic lifters. There's the rub...hydraulic
lifters require extra clean oil, and to that end, the
Beetles have an oil filter which comes off the oil
pump.  Unfortunately, it doesn't really work on a bus
(type 1, at least) because the carrier bolts for the
moustache bar occupy the same space.  Miguel's solution
is to just attach the engine to the moustache bar,
which although he claims works fine for some guy in his
shop isn't something I'm willing to try with a brand
new engine and tranny.  Here are the alternatives, as I
see them: 1.Find some way of working around the bolt(s)
...doubtful. 2. Run high quality oil and dump it every
3k miles (which I should do anyway, and which Miguel
says would solve all my problems of keeping the oil
clean since I don't run on dirt roads anyway). 3. Find
an alternate way of mounting an oil filter suggested by
my brilliant, helpful type 2 friends (an excellent possibility).
