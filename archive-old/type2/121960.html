Subject: My Brakes is broke - Cracked linings on shoes

Hi Volks,

Had a bit of squeaking and a dragging sound from the P/S rear wheel 
recently, so after work today I pulled the wheel and removed the drum. 
What a PITA that task can be when you are beset by a seized adjuster.

Inside the drum things looked OK but the linings on both shoes are 
deeply cracked. Is this normal? There is still a lot of lining on the 
shoes after 30000 miles on them, but the cracks look pretty scary. I 
also need to replace one adjuster star, as I broke a couple teeth off 
getting it apart. Note to self: Must get more anti-seize.

Just a few more details to attend to and everything will be peachy for 
the trip to EveryBus. Anyone have suggestions for tightening up a worn 
wiper arm shaft? I could drill it through and use a pin to keep it in 
place, but that seems a bit drastic. Tomorrow the weather is supposed 
to be up to 7C/45F, so I hope to get spend some quality time in the 
driveway with these and other minor issues.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
