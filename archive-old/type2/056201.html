Hello All,
   A couple of other things to consider. Next time an RV show is held in your area, go. It will cost you about 6 bucks for a bunch of dealers to show you their product. What you will find, in addition to the big monster motor homes is a variety of campers built on the Ford/Chevy/Dodge van chassis. None of the ones I've seen have an interior layout as practical and spacious as my '76 Westy. I saw one that even had a small bathroom with a shower ( you would have to sit on the potty while using the shower, save time by taking care of two things at once. At 6'4&quot;, I found this feature particularly amusing) The price for all this cramped luxury? About 45K!! As for the difference in cost of pistons for a VW and a Porsche, Its because they know they can't sell pistons to a VW owner for 2K, but they can to a Porsche owner ( not saying Porsche owners are stupid) Having owned Corvettes and boats, I'm very familiar with this pricing scam. Take a part that is the same for a GM 350 V8 from !
a Caprice, and that same part will cost more if you tell the parts guy its for a 'Vette. BTW, I found years ago that most parts prices are negotiable, especially at new car dealers. I had a GMC van with a 6.2 diesel that would eat glow plug controllers. I went to GMC dealer to get one (3rd one in a year and a half, always cost $95.00) and they were out. He sent me to Chevy dealer down the street. He had them, $129.00. I said no thanks, GMC dealer always charged $95. He immediately dropped the price to $102.00.   Jeff
