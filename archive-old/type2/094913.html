Subject: Re: [VB] Dodge City, KS

After the trip back from Colorado Springs with my Single Cab a couple guys 
from Dodge emailed me talking about the VW stuff out West.  Sounds like 
things might be picking up out there.  The same guys drove the 5 hours to 
Topeka for our last show.  They were talking about the 4th.  I guess they 
make a deal with all the folks they help out.  If they have worked you your 
aircooled VW you are obligated to put it in the parade.

I'm hoping this tread will catch their eye, so that they can forward me the 
information.  They left the Topeka show before I could get their contact 
numbers.

I grew up in Hutchinson, Kansas, and will be there over the Holiday.  The 
drive to Dodge will be a nice distraction from my very non-VW family.
