Subject: another show

I've written to mintunz_at_cdsnet_dot_net about another event. The event was 
listed as follows, on http:\\members.aol_dot_com./johnbmtl/events.html

VW All Comers Meet All VW's welcome!!
It's a day to show your car or van and look at everybody else's.
At the Growers Market in Grants Pass, Oregon.
Oct. 27, 1996.

It looks like my carb is vibrating loose again (it's developed that 
weird &quot;whistle&quot; again), so I might not make the one this weekend, but 
I'll make it if it looks like a reasonable chance of getting back w/o 
problems. Grants Pass is only 176 miles, so it looks like the better 
bet, if I can only make one.

I'll post more, if I/when I get directions.
