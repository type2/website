Hi Everybody,
    About a year or so ago my wife came home from the Salvation Army
thift store with a bunch of plastic containers that are a PERFECT fit in =
the
spice rack in our '71 westy.  The contianers are spice shakers made by
Tupperware.  We don't use them for spices, but do use them for things =
like tea bags, instant coffee, matches and small packages of salt, =
pepper and sugar.
Since we do our cooking outside the bus it's really handy to have these =
things right where they can be easily reached.  I checked the Tupperware =
web site and see that they do still offer spice shakers, although I =
didn't check to see if the sizes listed would fit in the spice rack.  =
I'll leave that to you if you are interested.
