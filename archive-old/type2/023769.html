Hi volks,

 Good question. AFAIK there's no current manufacture of type-4
engined vehicles. The type-4 car was sold in Brazil with the 
type-4 engine, though the buses wern't. At the moment there's
still a reasonable aftermarket for type-4 parts (Type-4s,
busses, type-3s, 914s) but that won't last forever.

&gt; don't have air condition, I think they're rather low-tech
&gt; anyway; the Vanagons might well have air condition,
&gt; but I don't know for certain.

 Was this a typo, Erik? I think that &quot;vanagons&quot; are only 
built in South Africa, where they have watercooled 
inlines. The South African ones are pretty sophisticated
and do have A/C. I think they continue with the T4
bodyshell because it suits conditions there better than
the T5 (more clearance etc.).
 The South American bays are pretty utilitarian. I doubt
any of them have A/C.
