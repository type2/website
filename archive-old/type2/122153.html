Subject: [T2] question gas motor that sounds like a diesel

&gt;1700 fuel injected type 4???
&gt;
&gt;Are you running a 914/ 411 engine with D jetronic in your bus??
&gt;
&gt;Bus engines in the FI flavor were only 1.8 and 2.0L, L jetronic FI

I believe mine was built up, stuck fi into it, then recently
had the 'pertronics' (?) rings a bell, put on it.

James
