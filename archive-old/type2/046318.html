Subject: Re: [T2] Is this happening to you?

I cannot figure my kids out. They refuse to ride to school in the bus. They
are embarrassed. The other day Alice fought with me to take the other car.
Then I pointed out the shirt she was wearing. A Peace frog shirt with a
circle of VW busses!!

Guess I really drive a POS. :-(

count the number of peace signs that ive been flashed
as well as smiles.  two ones i remember in particular
was a couple high school kids driving past waving and
holding up a bag of, well, you know...and another was
on our trip east this summer when we were pulling out
a rest area, we were going past a family with a little
girl about 4 who looked up at me, gave me the thumbs
up and said &quot;cool bus!&quot;  at least i know some parents
out there are raising there kids right:)&gt;&gt;
