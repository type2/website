Subject: Is my alternator toast?

So a week or so ago I cooked the wiring harness from the alt to the VR 
and the hot wire all the way to the starter.  It fused and melted and 
ignited.  It wasn't pretty.  Today I go to put my newly built harness on 
and hook everything up and the batery and EGR light come on and flicker 
as I rev the engine.  The more RPMs the faster the flicker.  Did the 
heat / fire cook my alternator?  How many volts should I see at the 
battery when running?

Thanks in advance.
