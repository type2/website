&gt;&gt; Another handy thing about turning a Bus into a hybrid is all the room in
the back. If you install a raised cargo platform in a Eurovan, under it will
fit a *lot* of batteries. Put a big passel of truck batteries under there,
fit it with a gas (diesel or propane  would work too)/electric hybrid motor,
charge batteries while the fuel motor is running, and you could go a very
long way before the batteries died. Sounds like a passable delivery van to
me. &lt;&lt;

Since we seem to be tolerating this thread, my two cents:  The whole hybrid
concept seems to be going at it the wrong way.  If you use a small
dyno-fueled engine to spin a generator at one rpm constantly, rather than
having to operate at a range of say 800 - 4000 rpms, it would be way more
efficient, produce much lower emissions and could be used to charge the
batteries only.  The batteries should power an electric motor directly
driving the transmission.  When the batteries reach a low power threshold,
the small engine kicks in to charge the batteries on the fly.  No more need
to plug in, but you COULD plug in and then all of your local trips would
never produce any local emissions (acknowledging the remote power plant
emissions) and the only local emissions would result from the small engine
charging the batteries on longer trips.  OBC: That would make the ultimate
delivery van or passenger van.  Good thing my employer doesn't read this
list...this concept is probably heresy in the world of big oil  =)

As for the commercial, I thought the &quot;jab&quot; was purely a comparison of the
aging hippie driving a poorly maintained Bus TODAY as compared to the modern
greenie driving the hybrid TODAY, not a comparo of environmentalism then
versus now (or economics t. vs. n.).
