Subject: backed up mail

Volks,

You may have noticed a bit of extra mail within the last 24 hours (he 
said with his tongue firmly planted in his cheek :-)  there was a bit of 
a server problem and, in clearing it, a bunch of old posts that had been 
lodged in the server were shaken loose.  Some are a month or more old, so 
watch the date on a post before you reply (I nearly spoke firmly to a 
couple of people about Friday-only posts on Saturday before I figured out 
the post *was* from a Friday, just 2 weeks ago :)
