Subject: Re: [T2] Saturday parts delivery?

My son, when 12, ordered a sales kit from the back of a comic book... 
you know the ones: Sell greeting cards, win a mini-bike, etc. He ordered 
it on December 23rd. We lived in Puerto Rico at the time. Christmas 
morning there was a knock at the door. For a second, I started believing 
in Santa Clause again, since we had already opened all of our presents 
and I didn't get what I asked for. Lo and behold, there was the mailman 
with a second-day delivery addressed to my son. We excitedly opened the 
parcel, and there was the sales kit all the way from the continental US 
two days after it was sent, delivered on Christmas day, no extra charge.
I'm still impressed.
If you've gotta ship something valuable, registered mail can't be beat. 
Insure $10,000 for $17.35. Just don't use plastic tape... it has to be 
paper, 'cause they stamp postmarks all over it as a tamper-evident seal.

Bus content: I'll soon be parting out a '79 Westy. Anybody need anything?
