Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Parts from a '71?

Larry said:


 I've owned a couple '71s over the years. Here's a list of oddball parts
 to look for: front engine tin (the one behind the fan housing), left
 side intake manifold (the one with the nipple for the brake booster),
 upper master cylinder reservoir and hose (especially if you find the
 little rubber seals that go between the reservoir nipple and the hose),
 light switch (the repro unit doesn't have the right spades on it), stub
 axle (maybe not one year only but I know they changed a couple times in the
first few years of the IRS Busses), belly pan (the one that goes
 over the mechanicals at the front of the Bus), wing windows (the back
 ones have a tendency to rust out), seat belt retractors (the ones that
 go in the middle of the front seatbelts so you don't have to deal with
 all that extra seat belt material every time you get in and out),
 original hubcaps (the repros are crap), rare options (clock, side step,
 jalousie windows, sunroof [cables, etc.], jailbars).

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

The left intake never fed the booster. The center section has a large nipple
below the carb. Looks like this:

The brake hose sleeves are still available new from VW and a lot of vendors.
I would not use them over....they fall apart looking at them.
#59 here: http://www.ratwell_dot_com/technical/Microfiche/t205100.gif
Part number 211 611 833C
http://www.busdepot_dot_com/details.jsp?partnumber=211611833C
West Coast Metric has them on a skin pak card, 2 on a card. 211-833C
But they are over priced....

The correct light switch [old ones 99% of the time have lost the dash
rheostat] is being made by VWG and is sold by Airhead Parts.
