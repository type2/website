If you've done the VIN switcheroo, the MV dept. computer will show the old
bus, not the diesel. Maybe OK in NC, but what about other states? And if
you try to sell it, and the next owner gets caught, could/would HE bail out
of it and accuse you of fraud? I tend to think this could get really sticky.
These regs about changing VINS are to prevent stolen cars from reenter-
ing the market...The penalties would be the same for a $100 bus as for a
Lambo...
