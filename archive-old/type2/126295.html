Subject: Re: [T2] Jack

I wouldn't trust those stock jacks as far as I can toss my bus, I use a
hyd jack,  even a little bottle jack is better.

Guess I should have mentioned that too. They are really bad jacks. If the vehicle moves forward or backward just a bit, the jack will twist and the car/van will come down. IMHO they are very hard on the jacking points too. I've seen several twist off and ruin running boards on Beetles and pinch the body. 

They work - - barely. Only on dry, sunny, days with non-rusty, all stock, VWs sitting on flat, shady, dry, smooth, concrete surfaces as found in garages... &lt;grin!&gt; I prefer a hyd jack or a screw jack that lifts on the body seam. I have one from a Jeep product I think. It is a ratchet affair but lifts at the body seam. I still carry my stock VW jack around for conversation though. 

Chris
