Subject: Re: [T2] Flicker

I've noticed this on my '71.  I think that this is the overvoltage relay kicking in in the voltage regulator.  It seems to do it more in the weeks 
after after a fresh battery is installed.  A voltmeter revealed that it was cycling from about 12.7 to 13.7 volts.  You should do a voltmeter 
check too to make sure that you aren't getting too much voltage.

&gt; Interesting experience this evening. I started my bus and turned on the
&gt; headlights. At idle the headlights and dash lights appeared normal, but when
&gt; I revved the engine they began to flicker-- go bright then dimmer, then
&gt; bright again, then dimmer, then normal. At idle they returned to normal
&gt; again. This continued while driving, but very intermittently.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm thinking voltage regulator? Any other ides?
