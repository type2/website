Subject: 5 speed transmission in loaf bus!
Message-ID: &lt;D3C18AEA0EA1D111B8DA00805F85E889011F9101_at_dsntexsrv3.diasham_dot_com&gt;

OK, the time is finally upon me.  I've finished the 914 2.0 motor and have
pulled the old one out of my 73 Westy.  This weekend I will remove the
transmission and start test-fitting the 5 speed tranny that is going in
there.  It is a 901 tranny from a 1970 Porsche 911.  I've got an article
&gt;from the V-gon archives from several years ago that give me some info, but
it references some diagrams that are not there.

So, if anyone out there has a 901 5 speed in their bus or has any
information on fabricating the front mounts or re-routing the shift rod or
any other info, please please please let me know now.

I'm planning on taking some pictures and making any drawings that I can so
that if the conversion is successful I can post the procedure for anyone
else who is interested.  

The gist of it is that you replace the inner CV's with beetle CV's (same
spline as bus axle, same bolt pattern as 901 tranny flange).  You use a 914
clutch and flywheel.  The bus clutch cable length is OK, you just have to
transfer the cable mount from the bus tranny to the 901.  You fabricate
front mounts and attach them somewhere (I'd love to see the diagram
referenced in the article).  You create a new shift rod tube with 1&quot; conduit
and aim it for the different location of the tranny shift shaft and use
stock bus bushings.  And you shorten the existing shift rod to the correct
length by cutting/welding it.

I'll let you know more as I go along.
