Subject: Re: Convertable console for walk-throughs

Just had two more ideas:

(D) Canvas console slung child's cot style on dowels between seat pedestals.

(E) All-Lego console (for bus owners with children)

If this list comes up with fewer than 100 designs, I will personally be 
disappointed. Michael Benthin should be good for twenty.
