Subject: Re: [T2] Re: battery bracket?

An even easier way to prevent the battery from moveing is to get a plastic
battery box from someplace like Pep Boys. Runs like 6-8 bucks,used for
trailers or boats, keeps anymore acid from rusting out whatever floor is
still there. The one I had in the 70 was a perfect fit and didnt move at
all. Also keeps the cables from grounding on tools or whatever else you
might be probeing around with back there.

&gt; There's a little bracket set you can get at your local FLAPS in the
battery
&gt; section that screws into that same hole and catches on the lip at the
&gt; bottom of the battery. That's what I've got (it's red). I think you're
&gt; lucky that bolt hole hasn't rusted away.

&gt; &gt;I think I heard the bolt in the battery tray I had put in a year ago on
my
&gt; &gt;71 westy is for some sort of strap or bracket to hold the battery, which
I
&gt; &gt;don't have. My battery always slides around, making loud noises and me
&gt; &gt;nervous. Anyone know where i can get such a bracket/strap?
