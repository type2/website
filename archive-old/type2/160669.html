Subject: Swivel Seat for Driver - ??

Does anyone have a swivel seat setup for the driver in their late bay?
Like, the same swivel seat/base that is found on the passenger side on the
Westies..

I looked at my '78 Westy, and I can see that the passenger seat  would be
able to tightly set in the driver side if it was facing backwards (with the
driver's rear seat partition cut out, of course.  I am not an idiot.  And
no, this is NOT a pole on if I am an idiot. However, I am a bit psycotic, if
that gives any reassurance...)

But I got to thinking:  with a swivel base installed in the driver side,
will I be  able to ROTATE the driver's seat PAST the steering wheel???

Barry
