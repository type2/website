Subject: Re: [T2] Tough steering


&gt;
&gt;OR you could just have a bunch of worn out parts.  Drag link ends, tierod
&gt;ends, swinglever pin bushing, balljoints....all of this will add up to
&gt;keep your steering geometry out of wack, no matter what you do.  Which
&gt;might explain the randomness.

I would for sure not drive it until you do fix it. Maybe a slow drive to 
the alignment shop for an inspection.

Lawsuits, towing bills, van replacement, and hospital bills for yourself 
and the car you might hit are much, more expensive than fixing it...
