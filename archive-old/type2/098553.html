Subject: Re: [T2] possible oops

&gt; ok, i may have made a mistake. i took the drive shaft off to get to the

&gt; boot. this stuff is blue and it is for bearings. do i need a special kind
&gt; of grease for the CVs or is this grease ok?

Yes there is special grease for CVs. Just go to the flaps and get some.
No biggie. wipe off the old, pack with the new. not too much like 4-6 oz I
think. bearings full plus a little gloop, nowhere near a bootful.
The CV grease has moly for the higher pressure in the cv environment.
