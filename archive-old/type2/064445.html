Subject: Administrative Droning...

Been a long time since I had to do one of these. Three things:

1. Private email is an ideal medium for flaming, because it needn't waste
anybody's time but yours and the flamee can filter you. Public lists are a
very poor medium for flaming because it wastes the time of (in this case)
four hundred people. Well-bred people whose dignities are offended do their
brawling in the parking lot, not in the saloon. Okay?

2. French-speaking folks: fair enough. But the Commissar (that's me) is not
very cosmopolitan and he cannot dig any French except the dirty bits.
Hence, ob-VW-wise, you guys are on the honor system. I suspect you lot are
not being all that honorable at present but I cannot prove it. Somebody
translate that.

3. Seven-bit characters, 80 columns. If you don't know *exactly* what that
means, send me a message and I will be happy to explain it.

Specifically for people who write their mail from Netscape, which software
is by far the worst offender, pay attention (this means you):

- --Netscape does not wrap intelligently. If your window is too wide when you
compose, your message will be too wide when people get it. We need you to
use a window no more than ten words wide, okay? Otherwise the UNIX folks
end up with a message that looks like sawteeth and it's dreadfully hard to
read. Shrink those windows down small.

- --We have to get your character set set up the right way. Do this:

   --Pull down the &quot;Options&quot; menu

   --Choose &quot;Mail and News Preferences&quot;

   --Choose &quot;Composition&quot;

   --If you have &quot;Allow 8-bit&quot; checked, you're causing all
     kinds of mayhem. Choose the other one. Eight-bit character
     sets make many mail readers geek.

That's it, really. Welcome all newbies, there were a boatload this week.
Bob's back, Joel's back, Clara's back, all's right. ;)
