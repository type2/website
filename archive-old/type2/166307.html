&gt; hey Bob  Yeah know all about that but this guy left out the exhust 
&gt; gaskets so what would be expected, he probably left the head gaskets out 
&gt; also.  LOL  later  md

He said he had left them out because they were not on there to begin 
with - he wasn't totally sure if he needed them.  However, he did say 
that there were no head gaskets and he did put 0.010 shims underneath 
each of the cylinders.

I'm wondering if the headers are really seating against the exhaust 
ports.  We'll run it again and do some more research...
