Paul,

I wrote up a procedure for changing stock beam for stock beam... it
required no tools not found in an ordinary tool box.

The post is in the archives.. (buried a bit, but I found it...:) the URL
to get to it direct is:

Also search on &quot;front axle replacement&quot;

In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. 
But, in practice, there is.

&gt; Is there anybody who's replaced a beam and can tell me what tools I do

&gt; a fortune!) And does the beam just drop out once the bolts are undone, or
&gt; do you really need to force it out with a sledgehammer (sounds dangerous in
&gt; the confines underneath a bus).
&gt; 
&gt; Any help, hints, etc. on this will be warmly received - hopefully if I have
&gt; the bottle I'll go ahead this weekend with it.
