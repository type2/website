It might just be the idle circuit in your carb isn't set. The choke
might be making up for the low idle and when it cuts out the carb
isn't adjusted enough. I suspect you have a 30pict but here is a link
in the library to easy steps tuning a 34pict:

The non vacuum distributors idle just as well as the vacuum ones. The
issue with those are getting from idle to full/partial throttle with
out the 009 stumble. 

&gt; I think I'm on the right track, the distributor being the cause of
&gt; my idling problem, my question is should I swap out my distributor
&gt; with one that has a vacuum canister or should I try to make the 009
&gt; work ?

if you have a working vacuum distributor I would use that, but I
believe your problem lies with your carb. BTW has it been
cleaned/rebuilt recently?
