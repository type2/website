&gt; The chassis of a US spec Beetle is taken south of the border. Once there it
&gt; is restored, and on it installed all of the new makings of a Beetle.
&gt; Basically everything from a new air cooled Beetle is installed on the US
&gt; spec frame.
&gt;
&gt; Then once returned to the US it can be registered as the 1973 VW Beetle it
&gt; started out as.

Yes, and you end up with a swing-axle bug with front disk brakes and
small 4 wheel bolts!  Very bizarre.
