Subject: [T2] trying to do my rear brakes and need help!

Hello listees, I am trying to replace my rear brake shoes and so far am
getting nowhwere.  I cannot even losen my lug nuts!  I have sprayed WD40
on them and this stuff called PB blaster and so far nothing is working. 
I am not a weak woman by any means but I am REALLY trying to loosen
these damn things and getting very frustrated.  Is there some trick I am
missing?  The other thing is, a friend of mine told me I need to have a
special &quot;sping removal&quot; tool otherwise I will not be able to get the
springs off. Is this true?  Thanks in advance for any help.  Beth and
&quot;Prudence&quot; the '78 bus in NJ.
