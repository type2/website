Subject: Marveling

Interesting exchange.
while not a chemical engineer I have a number of
years testing aircraft bits and pieces and
sometimes the whole bird for design engineers.

What I have found is that the test lab is the real
proof of a good design be it a modification to an
existing design or a &quot;new&quot; concept.

With lubricants, the tested &amp; accepted rule is that
you don't want to mix them. They generally dont
like each other and will alter the design properties.
Most of the time it is not a positive effect.
So based on my experience I would never mix anything
in
with my oil.
  Now that does not say that MMO will cause your
engine's oil to degrade.. I dont know that. I'm not
sure anyone has actually run a &quot;controlled test&quot; on
this product.
  So I would err on the side of caution and not use
it myselfe. I know a couple of experienced mechanics
who would advise the same (as they have with me).
  Tim's adherence to emperical data would be my choice
based on a couple of years of lab work testing
&quot;innovations&quot;. With very few exceptions lab test will
show flaws in theory as not all variables can be
accounted for in structural (or electrical) designs.

  The variable in the preceding interchange would be
the obvious attention to preventive maint. given to
the engine that the MMO was used in.
  The only real way to determine who is right and who
is wrong on the subject of MMO is to run 4 engines, on
stands under the exact same conditions (load, cooling,
preventive maint. procedures etc.) 2 with just the
factory spec. oil and 2 with MMO/oil combo. The 2
engines for each situation would help eliminate 
skewing data due to possible manufacturing or
material flaws in one. Does anyone know of this being
done by an independent test lab?

  General rule of thumb. Dont mix lubricants.
Having said that MMO may very well perform as stated.
Use it in your own bus but I wouldnt feel very good
about someone (a professional mechanic for example)
using it in my bus without hard data. Which no
one has brought to the table yet that I know of.

  Those of you who use it an like it.. great! But
I wouldnt advise a friend to use it as I cant say I
have seen real proof one way or the other.

  I have witnessed to many failures in new concepts
and previously untested old concepts and or methods to
be comfortable with running MMO. It apparently does
have other uses.
  Lastly a good example of a commonly accepted lube
would be WD-40. Which is a great parts cleaner but
not a good lubricant (long term).. Tri-Flow would
be my choice for a spray on lube. Yes it was tested.

  Flame if you will, but facts are facts only when
proven. &quot;Tried and true&quot; methods may not always be
what
they seem.. or they might be! But ya just never know...
