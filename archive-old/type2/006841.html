Thanks for the kind words. I'm amazed by the speed of it, too. It occured
to me today that since this thing can propogate messages from places as far
away from itself as Australia in a matter of seconds, it very well may be
faster than all of our busses put together. ;)

Digest people: I'm still getting the hang of it, it's still birthing
digests at unpredictable intervals. Birthing them at intervals by size is
not something listserv is designed to do, it thinks of it as a kludge. It
wants to do them once a day so I have to fight it. Hang in there, I'll
subdue it eventually.
