Subject: Probably a stupid question about my '73

    I started the restoration today on my &quot;new&quot; 73 bus, and ran across
something that I cannot find the answer to anywhere.  I was removing the
engine pieces from the cargo compartment (!), and there is a flap in the
floor right where the middle seat would be sitting (if it was there!).
Just a lid that raises up and goes down into some corrugated looking
tubing that curves up toward the front end.  Probably a stupid question,
but what the heck is it and what does it do??
    Also, if anyone knows of a decent 1700cc engine that is all in one
piece, let me know.  It does not matter if it is blown or not as I will
rebuild it.
    Thanks!!
