&gt;      On the other hand, I was in my Bus in a parking

&gt; corner. I got out to look 
&gt; at it and in-
&gt; form her of what she had done. She politely looked
&gt; at the damage (slight to 
&gt; be sure),
&gt; and said, with a smile, &quot;Oh, that's okay, it's just
&gt; an old car anyway...&quot;


Hmmm....sounds familiar! While moving to Arizona, my
wife and I stopped to get some ice just outside of
Stockton, Ca. (why I chose there to stop, I'll never
know ;-). 

My wife was in the bus while I was using the phone
(talking to my former mechanic about a growing
oil-leak, no less), when a woman who was parked next
to us backed out and put a nice crease down the
driver's side of my otherwise pristine bus! My wife
started yelling at me across the parking lot to tell
me what happened and I got there just in time to stop
the woman from fleeing the scene. I had to literally
stand in front of her car to stop her.

Of course, it turned out that she was an illeagal
immigrant from Mexico and the vehicle wasn't even
registered in her name, let alone the fact that she
had no insurance! She of course denied that she'd done
anything (I found this out through a passerby who
spoke Spanish), even though my wife was in the bus at
the time, *and* the fact that my paint was on her
bumper!

I called the cops, but being on private property, they
were in no hurry to show up. *TWO* hours later, a
bonafied CHiP showed up and luckily, spoke Spanish as
well. After much verbal wrangling, it was clear that I
was not going to recieve any compensation, but that if
she couldn't show proof of insurance on her day in
court, her vehicle would be seized....permanently!

The woman then proceeded to tell the cop that he was
racist and that he was only doing this because she was
Mexican. Boy, did THAT piss him off! He pulled out his
wallet and showed her a picture of his wife and
kids....yep, his wife was a native of Mexico ;-)!!!!
He then found every infraction available to write her
up on.

Needless, to say, I got my pound of flesh, even if the
dent is still on my bus!!!!!!!
