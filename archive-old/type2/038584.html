&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; Geez, I just purchased a new set of tires for my '79 Westy.  I thought I
&gt; did my homework and eventually decided on a full set of 185R14 Michelin MX
&gt; 6ply reinforced tires with a load/speed rating of 94R (1540lbs.)  I
&gt; must've called a dozen places trying to find a deal.  Best price I found  
&gt; was $90ea (installed).  Other tire considerations were the usual suspects,
&gt; Bridgestone 603V ($10 cheaper) and Yokohama 356 (couldn't find around
&gt; here.)  Guess I went with the Michelin because of the name and the
&gt; recommendations from mechanics and FLAPS folks.
&gt; 
&gt; But now am I to assume that these are not up to spec?

1540 pounds is the magic number in my owner's manual, so these tires
should be OK.

As far as Michelin goes, check the archives.  Some have had failures with
the belts stripping off of the carcass and whipping the heck out of the
wheel well and battery trays.  I had this happen to me, luckily on a
C*evy, not an important vehicle.

Personally, I went for the Bridgestones and am very pleased with them.
