&gt; &gt; 1)  What is this wierd little spring loaded doohickey center under my
&gt; &gt; dash?
&gt; &gt; http://www.skanky_dot_org/bus/wonder/MVC-111F.JPG
&gt; &gt; Just wondering...
&gt;
&gt; I can not tell from the picture, but is this near your E-brake. If so it
is
&gt; a button that when out lights the brake light in the dash denoting that
the
&gt; E-brake is on. The light is supposed to go off when the switch is
depressed.
&gt; Mine was disconnected when I bought it and still is.

That's what I originally thought too but that's not where the switch is on a
'79.  It is indeed a door contact switch, just like the ones used to turn on
the interior light when you open the door.  These switches work by grounding
whatever is plugged into the switch contact when the button is not pushed.
For example, in the door application, the interior light is always supplied
with power.  When you open the door, the switch contact is no longer pushed
in and a ground path is made to the door frame -- the light comes on.

The exact same kind of switch is used to turn on and off the brake warning
light on the dash based on whether the parking brake is set or not.  You can
see part of this switch mounted to the dashboard below the ashtray (at least
that's where it is on a '79).

The switch in the pic is the same kind of switch but farther under the dash.
That's not where VW ever put one, so I would tend to guess that some
previous owner had perhaps wired in some kind of kill switch using one of
the VW door contact switches, but who knows?
