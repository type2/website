Subject: RE: stuck battery cable calmps

Big Snip....

&gt; 
&gt;    Baking soda does wonders on battery corrosion.If that still doesn't
&gt; work,
&gt; hack off the cable ends at the battery as they probably need replacing
&gt; anyway.

	[]  I would do this as a last resort. Before doing this, I'd try to
pry them up with a large screwdriver, or small 
	crowbar. Better you rip the post out of the battery than hack your
battery cables which could end up too short,
	and then need to be replaced.

	However lets start at step one.

	Battery pliers make this job a lot easier. Their jaws are good for
prying, as well as fitting the corroded nuts on the
	clamp well.

	Have you loosened the bolt or nut on the cable clamp?

	After this, then try to pry the two ends of the &quot;C&quot; of the
	clamp apart - where the bolt was holding it together. Because the
posts are tapered, 
	you don't have to make the clamp very much bigger for it to come off
easily.

	After this, then you grab the top of the clamp on the cable end, and
try to wiggle it
	back, and forth, and around in a circle while pulling up. Try to
wiggle it in all directions

	If this fails, try prying between the battery and the clamp, moving
from one side of the post to 
	the other. 

	If the battery is toast, you may want to try a bit o percussive
maintainance - Bang it with a hammer;-)

	PS: HAs anybody got a good gas  heater exhaust pipe  they don't
need? How do I ID the heater type without removing the
	belly pan? And distinctive characteristics of the exhaust pipe I
could tell by?
