&gt; I'm intrigued by John
&gt;  &quot;aircooled_dot_net&quot; Connolly's suggestion to place the sender at the end of the
&gt;  main oil galley, which is the way it's done on the 911 engine (the only
&gt;  difference being that unlike the 911, it would read the temperature 
_before_
&gt;  the oil cooler.

So if I want to measure oil temp just past the oil cooler in a type 1 engine, 
do you know where I should put my sending unit?
