Subject: Re: [T2] GoWesty Alloy Wheel Package

Shouldn't the air pressure chosen be based on the tire manufacturer's 
figures and not on the VW sticker? Alot of tire technology has come along 
since the tire pressure stickers were applied at the VW factory.

Call the help line and ask the technical guys what the pressures should be 
for you load.


&gt;Yes, I have the correct pressures according to both the steering column
&gt;decal and Bentley.
