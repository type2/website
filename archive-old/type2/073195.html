David Raistrick, our secret weapon, changed the name of our server (and
there was much rejoicing!). It used to be named &quot;rotary&quot;, after the Mazda
rotary engine, because...I think just to annoy us.

It is now named &quot;lenti&quot; in honor of the machine at the University of
Minnesota that hosted the Vanagon list for so many years. Apparently
&quot;lenti&quot; means &quot;lens&quot; in Latin if you want to know. This was Steve's idea. I
wanted to name it &quot;bootycall&quot;.  =^ o

Messages sent to listname_at_rotary.type2_dot_com should still work fine. However,
if you filter your incoming mail into separate folders or mailboxes, the
name change may have broken your filter. Please adjust accordingly.
