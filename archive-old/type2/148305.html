Subject: Re: [T2] One version of why we are &quot;orphans&quot; of VW

Speaking of, this is a true story. My friend was driving a Kelmark
(for sale, by the way) and going quite a bit over the speed limit on
I-5. He passed a hidden Highway Patrol car and looked in his mirror
and saw it kicking up gravel as it pulled out behind him and he let
off the gas.

It must not have clocked him because it followed him for quite a while
without doing anything. My friend got tired of being followed, so he
got off the freeway to stop at a gas station. Sure enough, the CHP
followed him off. When he pulled into the gas station, the CHP got out
and took an admiring look at the car and said, &quot;Nice car. Pretty fast
isn't it?&quot;

My friend in all seriousness said, &quot;No Ma'am. It's a Volkswagen, you know.&quot;
