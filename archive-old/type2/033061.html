Subject: EMPI/BugPack WARNING!!!!!!!!

All,

In light of all the new listees and people new to
busses, I figure it's time to post this warning again.

DO NOT BUY EMPI, OR BUGPACK PARTS FOR YOUR BUS!!!!!
THEY ARE *CRAP* AND NOT WORTHY OF *ANY* USE, OTHER
THAN A PAPER-WEIGHT!!!!

Yes, both companies make acceptable dress-up items,
but exhaust systems, tappets, etc., are all SH!T!

Spend the extra couple of dollars now, or be prepared
to spend a *lot* more next time (and it *will* be
soon, I assure you).


OK, I'm off my soap-box now.....just don't wan't to
see anybody taken like I was in the past (NEVER again,
though;-)
