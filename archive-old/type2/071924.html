Subject: Re: '73 Questions

&gt;I have the engine out right now and I'm going to clean it up and do a
&gt;little re-torquing while I have it out. Before removal I got _at_120 +/-5
&gt;all around, is this decent for the type 4? .

I would consider it acceptable, yes.

&gt;First- On the #1&amp;2 head(as I remember... car isn't in front of me)
&gt;there are two long studs that come out on either side of the intake
&gt;manifold, they appear to be some sort of ports or something..... what
&gt;are they?????

Sounds like the air injection ports.  There should be four on a '73 - two
on each head ('74 only had three - does anyone know why?)

&gt;Second- I believe this is a 1.7 engine... safe assumption (for the
&gt;time being). The engine has a single 2-barrel Weber on it. Is this OK
&gt;or am I looking at any potential problems/annoyances, because of this
&gt;setup?

I'm not touching that one.  :-)

-David
