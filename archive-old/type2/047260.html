Okay, now I finally understand what the Bowden tube is.  I assume you have
to get this part at the dealer?  I went through replacing the clutch cable
last year after mine broke.  I think it broke because of the Bowden tube.

Basically, the pedal did not feel as smooth as it once did.  It became
difficult to engage and disengage the clutch smoothly because it felt like
it was releasing in tiny stages - kind of hard to explain but hopefully you
know what I mean.  Felt like the cable or pedal was rubbing on something
and hanging up slightly.  I tried grease on all exposed areas but that
didn't help.  Then I tried squirting oil into the Bowden tube.  This helped
only briefly but tipped me off as to where the problem was.

After the cable snapped, I too had to disconnect the Bowden tube from the
tranny in order to get the new cable through.  What I found is that there
is a plastic (or nylon, or something similar) sheath inside the bowden
tube, presumably to protect the cable from rubbing on the metal walls of
the tube.  This sheath was worn through on one side (bingo).  Since I
didn't have a new one, I rotated the sheath 180 degrees and reinstalled it
with the new cable and it was baby-butt smooth after that.  For a while.
Now it's feeling less smooth again, and I know what that means.  Either the
sheath rotated, or wore through again.  The Bowden tube is old and shabby
anyway, so I'd like to replace it with a new one.

My question is, does the new Bowden tube come with the sheath?  The sheath
did not come with the clutch cable.
