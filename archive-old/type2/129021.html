Subject: Why... Won't... The... Motor... Come Out?

Well, there is an embarrassing point in all our lives, some of us get 
more than one.  ;])

I was dropping the 71 Transporter's motor and couldn't get a grip on the 
nut holding the bolt through the starter.

I found I could get a crescent wrench on it but couldn't turn the damn 
thing.

Well, I asked another person who has dropped many a motor and they said: 
&quot;Dude! the nut is right HERE...&quot;

Shades of mortification, the forth nut is facing the rear vs the other 
three that face the front of the Bus. (oh.)

Well, it turns out the starter bolt is a smooth faced end with a flat 
spot to keep from turning, which is what i was trying to do. Hmmm.


Anyway, I got the motor out on the dolly and pulled the top fan tin off 
to look inside. Sure enough the external oil cooler fitting (with inline 
oil filter mount) don't provide for a cooler inside the tin, it's just a 
relocation mod, not an additional cooler.

&lt;sigh&gt;

Anyway, if anybody in the SF Bay Area wants to drop off a spare power 
plant, I would really appreciate it. 8])
