Subject: Re: VW CD - Defeat?

Mine is more simple - but similar :
Bus broken, it's home.  List access only at work.  Need Bus to get to 
work, drat.  Hopefully same thing already happened to a listee, usually
not, AND I remember solution or kept print out.  Check printouts, 
nope, bother.  Fix it by what ever means, ouch.  Ask list next day to see 
what foolishness I performed the night before.  Oops, I'll have to go 
back and fix the fix, arrghh.

&gt; Okay but now it's getting funny. Here's how it goes when Hooper does it:
&gt; 
&gt; Be fixing bus. Have diagnosis problem. Too many variables. Become
&gt; frustrated. Climb out. Flip through manual. Smoke. Drink beer. Pace. Think
&gt; about asking list. Flip. Smoke. Drink. Curse. Ask list. Expect response
&gt; within thirty seconds. Don't get it. Curse. Smoke. Think.
&gt; 
&gt; (Add: hike across campus. Load CD. Try to find relevant bits. Get black
&gt; grease all over keyboard. Hear lab assistants whispering about you. Wish
&gt; you could smoke. Notice security person whispering with lab assistants.
&gt; Click madly through trying to find your particular problem which is never,
&gt; ever in there. Periodically wipe keyboard with elbow. Print something out
&gt; to prove you are not an insane homeless person.)
&gt; 
&gt; Figure it out from your own head. Check mail. Four replies. Note that three
&gt; replies are incorrect but well-intentioned, one is right but you already
&gt; know that. Go back and fix bus.
