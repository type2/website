Subject: Re: [T2] 72-79 Pickups' rarity

&gt; Comercial vehicles were not imported into the US after 1971 (as a result of the &quot;chicken war- tarrif wars&quot;) and that included single cabs (261),
&gt; double cabs (265), panels (211) or ambulances (274). Any such vehicles in the US later than 71's were probably grey-market cars. I'm guessing you're in the US, but I may be wrong! Such a vehicle would not be all that uncommon in the UK or European continent.

&gt; 69 double cab

Right
and I think as a consequence they were never DOT approved.
Remember someone (was it beetlemex) had a few of them but couldnt drive
them on the streets but took them to shows?
Im not sure how any of them get tagged and insured in the US but obviously
some have.
