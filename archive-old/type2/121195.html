Subject: help with vanagon alternator

My Dad purchased a new alternator from bus depot and it just arrived in 
the mail.  It's slightly different from the one that he had in his bus 
so I was hoping someone on the list could help him out as to what wire 
to put where.

The alternator on the left is the old one, the one on the right is the 
new one.  Notice that there is a plug on the old one, none on the new one:

Are these compatible?  They are both 90 amp if I remember correctly. 
Why the different connections?

thanks,
Mike
