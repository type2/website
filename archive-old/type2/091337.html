Subject: Re: [T2] tent storage

A bunch of people have commented on &quot;dry&quot; which is vital.  A couple of
people have opined on folded or not, about which I have no clue.  But I do
also want to mention that for whatever reason, MICE seem to find wads of
canvas (like a tent) an ideal place to nest.  And if the fold they find
is not big enough... well, they just chew it larger! and shit and piss all
over it!  with hantavirus!  how wonderful!

I dunno about mothballs... I have heard it and cedar are only good to add
smell, but i would add a lovely big plate of warfarin nearby to keep the
rodentia at bay!
