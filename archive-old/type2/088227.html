Subject: [T2] headliner/roof panels


OK, I'm giving up on the idea of fitting a headliner
to my 70' sunroof Kombi. There are just too many
unknown attachments.
 So... I've been reading in the library about installing
Baltic birch panels, as in a Westy.
 Does anyone know if the 70' Westys were made
from sunroof models with the roof cut away leaving
the lower sunroof pocket?
 Not too long ago someone on the list had a pattern
for the plywood panels, still have em?

TIA, Jako
70' sunroof Kombi
