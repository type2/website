Subject: Oil Leaks??

Hi Everyone,
Well I was going to pull the motor in my 80 westy in CT but at the last minute decided to rent a truck and pull it home.  So of course when I get it home it desides to run well and not smoke for me yet but I only ran it for about 20 mins and did not drive it because I have yet to reinstall the cv shafts. What I was wondering was I noticed oil comeing from some of the push rod seals some on the fan and some on the motor tranny end.  Could the oil leak into the exhust and cause the smoke to only come out of the exhust?  Also can I put that red stuff in the oil to see where the leaks are comeing from in an aircooled motor or is that a bad idea?  Thanks in advance for all your help it's been making this break down a whole lot easier.  Maybe I just towed it 250 miles for an oil leak?  Still need to do another compression test waiting for the battery to be fully charged. Also any listers heading to the VT show this weekend?
Thanks
Kevin
