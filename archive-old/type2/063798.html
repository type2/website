&gt; Anyone know how to get hold of Bus Boys.  I thought I sent them an
&gt; email (BusBoys_at_aol_dot_com) concerning purchasing the upper flanger to
&gt; the gas tank filler connection, but got no response. I can't get through
&gt; their toll free number (800-792-2697).  Maybe they are putting together
&gt; their catalog? I would like to replace this part, so if anyone can be of
&gt; assistance, please help me out.

1st and only thing, they are *very* busy and *very* understaff.  Bill is 
the *only* one answering phones right now.  All I can say is please don't 
give up on trying to reach them.  They are indeed a very reputable 
company and do appreciate your business.

Probably the best way to get in touch with them is to fax them.  I faxed 
them a $2000.00 order last week and before the end of the day I had a 
return fax notification confirming the parts had shipped that day.

* I am not a Bus Boys employee nor do I know any BusBoys employees, I am 
just a simple, happy, satisfied customer.

Ciao!
