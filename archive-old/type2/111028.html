&gt;Sorry to trouble you folks but since I do have a bus I am going to post this 
&gt;question.
&gt;
&gt;An errant driver running a red light has totaled my fully restored 1964 
&gt;sunroof bug. This was my practice car for my 62 15-window restoration with 
&gt;much credit due to Thom and several other list members for their patient 
&gt;advice on painting and related topics. The good news is that my daughter was 
&gt;well protected by the car and came away with a mild concusion and some 
&gt;bruises albeit thoroughly shookup. You could say the bug died protecting 
&gt;her. Anyway, both door posts have been pushed and the entire body is torqued 
&gt;so, in my opinion, the core of the car is dead.
&gt;
&gt;I am in the San Francisco bay area and am looking for a good bug body that I 
&gt;can use the parts from my 64 in. I would strongly prefer a 1961-63 ragtop 
&gt;since I am a complete fresh air fiend.  If it is within a reasonable 
&gt;distance, a few hours or so, and can be towed with a bar I can retrieve it. 
&gt;Alternatively, if someone can refer me to someone or someplace that may have 
&gt;such a car I would appreciate it.
&gt;
&gt;I would also prefer something affordably priced since I am currently out of 
&gt;work (anyone looking for a coldfusion programmer?)
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for listening.
