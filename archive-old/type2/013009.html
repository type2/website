As a last resort before you start a fire:

Since you've gotten several of the bolts out, take one to the hardware
store and see if you can match it up with an EZ-OUT tool. There are two
types; one has straight sharp edges and the other is a spiral type. ou'll
just need to make your decision on which one will work.

They work simply, drive it in with a hammer and start backing them out,
they tend to draw in tighter as you attempt to extract the bolt.
