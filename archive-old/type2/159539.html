You might want to check the oil straner and see if there are interesting
bits of things there, just as an exercise.  Use new gaskets/crush washer
and do not tighten over 9 ft/lbs.  But your compression #'s are good in
all 3 you can test, so I'd say if you put quality heads with the
improved seats in and do it right you're probably good to go.

Yeh, like I'm such an expert.  ;-)
