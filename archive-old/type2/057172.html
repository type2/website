The main thing that determines the waste heat energy produced by the
engine is the amount of power that the engine is producing.  This is
true regardless of the engine RPM.  The heat produced will be the same
whether the engine is making 40 hp at 2000RPM or 40 hp at 4000RPM.

If there is less air flow, then there must be a greater temperature
difference between the heads and the air to transfer the same amount
of heat energy.  The heads must run hotter to transfer the same heat
energy.
