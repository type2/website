Subject: Heater Blower Wiring and Mounting
Message-ID: &lt;0.4c993c22.255433d8_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

This may seem like a stupid question, but I don't have much to go on.  The 
manuals only show a vague picture.  My newly acquired  '75 Westy did not have 
a heater blower in the engine compartment.  I got one from Seth Avant (thanks 
Seth!) and will be putting it in this weekend.  I don't know another bus 
around here to look at.  Can someone tell me exactly how the wiring hooks up? 
 Also what are the numbers and sizes, etc. of the mounting bolts and any 
other hardware?  When it's in, if the switch doesn't work to make it blow, 
how do I check it out?

Thanks, David Hunt
