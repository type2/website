Subject: Re: [T2] missing, solution!

Bob,

It's just what the counterman told me....Turns out, that was the only
thing my Dad had done to his car in months and started having a problem
right after he did it.

In the three weeks before we fixed it, we did *every* check I could
imagine on his engine and ignition system.

&lt;grin&gt; you are quite welcome to try it on *your* plugs&lt;grin&gt;

Cheers, dave

&gt; Wow!
&gt; Is this a fact?
&gt; Mind you now, I'm not questioning you for any certain reason, but I want to 
&gt; make sure I can quote this tidbit of prestidigitator sort of knowledge and 
&gt; still be regarded as a man of unusual database fact..
