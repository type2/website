Subject: Re: [T2] generator light....

Hi Kinnie,
    I have had similar problems with short alternator brush life. If  the alternator bearings are bad they can cause this problem.

Subject: [T2] generator light....


&gt;
&gt; Hey,
&gt;
&gt; I have put new generator brushes in the top part of my generator about 2
&gt; weeks ago.  That stopped the generator light from going on.  Then it started
&gt; to come back on three days ago.  I put in new bottom generator brushes.  the
&gt; springs seem to be pretty tight. and the generator light went out again. so
&gt; yesterday I was christmas shopping and the generator light went on again.
&gt; High revs would not bring it off.
&gt;
&gt; I checked the brushes and they are almost warn down already.
&gt;
&gt; So, I have put in a new regulator about 1year ago and a generator is 5 years
&gt; at least.
&gt; How do I tell if the generator is bad....should i suspect the regulator?
&gt;
&gt; Anything else??  This is my daily driver....need to fix soon.
