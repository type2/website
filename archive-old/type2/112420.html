You don't need friends like that. ;-)

I don't have a/c because my bus came from the west coast of Canada (natures air condtioner) but I do have the fresh air fans and these are great for keeping cooler at stoplights. I always have the vent windows open unless it's too cold.

The best trick I've found to deal with the heat came from my wife who gets easily dehydrated on airlines. She gave me a small pocket-sized bottle with a misting valve on top that is filled with water. I squirt it on my face and arms as I drive in the heat and it keeps me cool. This is where the vent window and fresh air fans come in handy.
