 Bob,
 I don't think the 71 splash pan will fit the 69 bus.  I believe the 69
takes
 a longer pan.... anyone?

&gt; &gt; Bob,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I'd be interested in one of your bell-pan's if it will
&gt; &gt; fit a 69 bus ( I think it will ).  I'd gladly cover
&gt; &gt; your cost + some.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; thanks
&gt; &gt; Bob
