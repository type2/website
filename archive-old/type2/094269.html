&gt; If you WANT a poor quality paint job, take it to someone who /wont/ spend
&gt; a week to disassemble, prep, mask, another week to shoot primer, smooth it

&gt; shoot a few coats of color....then put it all back together.

He said, body work, prime, sand, prime, block sand, something, color sand,
then painting.
 
&gt; Maaco will probably do it in about a day for 500 bucks or so. (at least,
&gt; when we had a shop Astro painted, thats what it cost.  Had white window
&gt; rubber, a white trailer hitch, white inner wheel wells, white spotted
&gt; tires, white radiator, white lower frame rains....good thing I'd removed
&gt; everything that bolted on...else we'd have had a white sunroof frame and
&gt; seal, a white grill, white tail lights....probably a white license plate
&gt; too.  And spots of that paint job (door handle recesses) were peeling in 2
&gt; weeks.)

I don't want a maaco and I don't want to spend $5k either.
 
&gt;&gt; Obviously, this vw shop didn't need the business.
&gt; 
&gt; Or perhaps they have a reputation for doing good work and dont want to
&gt; spoil it with econo paint jobs.

I've been trying to find this out but nobody seems to be able to afford it.
 
&gt;&gt; Some kind of interim paintwork done by me is starting to sound like a
&gt;&gt; better idea all the time.
&gt; 
&gt; Nothing wrong with that at all.  I spent a week removing body filler, old
&gt; paint, old primer and a LOT of rust from the drip rail on the '66 all
&gt; around before I shot it with about 14 dollars worth of paint. (just 8&quot; up
&gt; from the drip rail and around it to the sides....a few other spots on the
&gt; roof where the rust had caused it to peel back as well.)

I could go 5 more years with rusty battery trays in this climate but I'd
like to have them fixed.  There is also a problem rust spot behind the right
rear bumper that is worrying me.  I'm not sure how long the rust under the
windshield will stay at bay.

&gt; I'm sure he'd attest as well to the amount of time even a small car such
&gt; as that can consume.

I did the engine compartment when I had the engine out and I appreciate the
work that goes into it.
