Subject: Deadhorse, Alaska, then tip of SoAm
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-MD5: 24ItNdg4tkJfzyK43RT0ug==


Forbes magazine, December 14, 1998, page 294, has a page on
&quot;The last tourist at the end of the earth&quot;--a story about how
more and more are driving up to the end of the road at Deadhorse,
Alaska.

Interesting part:
&quot;It's an antipodean thing: Many of these tourists then head for
the lower tip of Chile or other points south for the mirror-image
experience looking up, as it were.  Nothing much to see but you
can say you've been.&quot;

So...halfway 'twixt Inuvik and Caravana PanAmerica, busers have
already been pigeonholed by the media.  ;-)
