Subject: Re: bad verdict from engine mechanic: ugly choices


&gt;I've had a loss of power and mileage in my 1970 bus over the last 3-4 gas
&gt;tanks.

&gt;The Master Wrench's verdict: The engine is coming down to the
&gt;end of its days. He says the mechanic found signs that it had run hot
&gt;somewhere along the line--not overheated, he said, but hot all the same.
&gt;Heads are losing some compression [didn't ask him for numbers over the
&gt;phone], and there's some end-play in the crankshaft.  In short, he says,
&gt;it's an old engine coming to the end of its time.

You're aware that a worn rubbing block on points that aren't routinely
adjusted will give you this same symptom--but that's a five-dollar fix? You
need compression numbers, accept this guy's if you trust him or get a $20
gauge at Auto Zone and get your own numbers.

You can run with &quot;some end play&quot; for a matter of years if you have to--how
much is some?

If your heads are truly toasted, that would account for low compression,
but a re-torque and readjust won't really do any good.

I think you should get yourself an Idiot Book (or better a local Idiotic
Listee) and a few simple tools and find out what the real deal is. There is
only one way to know the truth about that engine and that is to get your
data firsthand--nothing esoteric about it, there are a few simple tests
that anybody can do, and a tune-up should be within the means of any bus
owner.

I know there are exceptions but in general most mechanics belong in the
penitentiary.
