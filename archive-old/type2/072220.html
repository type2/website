who replyed to my hesitation blues, especially jim arnott who pegged it
square. he also pointed out that the vanagon fuel pump works too, so i
found a low mileage 85er, and -- i dunno i'm a little peppy in my steppy --
two running buses?  LIST!  - steve

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; hi list - my 68 is on the road so i'm switching gears to get the 75 going.
&gt;&gt; a few weeks ago it began acting up. at 45mph it gave the dreaded
&gt;&gt; hesitation; one pull - that's it. a few trips later it happened one more
&gt;&gt; time. then a trip or two later it hesitated at 45mph once again. later in
&gt;&gt; the afternoon following the last single tug, the bus couldn't make it out
&gt;&gt; of my neighborhood. climbing a hill thwarted the attempt. i circled around
&gt;&gt; taking the flat route - no chance - i must have blown something out. its
&gt;&gt; been sitting since. it idles well, but under load of first gear it wants to
&gt;&gt; cut out.
