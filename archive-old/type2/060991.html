75 - 80 mph!!!

Being a bit optimistic I reckon,

To do this sort of speed with any kind of reliability I would think you   
    

need to build a bespoke engine using some of the specialist race engine   
    

parts (expensive).

IMHO these machines were not built for high speed, long distance runs on   
    

the motorway and it would save a lot of grief if the speed was kept down,   
    

I will not be using my bus over 60 mph, the engine has already done
130,000 miles (original) and is is super condition. I'm rebuilding it now   
    

and I will expect it to do at least another 130,000.

I am sure that there are folk out there with knowledge on how to build a   
    

strong reliable engine that will do what you want it to.
