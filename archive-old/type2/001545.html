Subject: Valve adjustment

Hello listies,
I adjusted my valves this morning however I noticed when I was done that the
books distributor-cylinder order and the order of PADME's(71' Westy) where
different, only problem is I didn't notice until after I warmed her up and
readjusted the carb. I was wondering if this is common, and if so can I
continue or do I have to readjust the valves? either way I really don't care
but if I do indeed have to readjust the valves how long do I need to wait
before I can do it due to the engine needing to cool?
Thank you all,
Scott Beaupied
PADME
