Prompted by more than a few requests I submit the contact info for
Bry's VW / Audi yard.
Bry's
4017 W Marginal Way Sw
Seattle, WA 98106
Phone: (206) 938-1270 
As I said before I am happy to go look there. Or you can also call em.
I am pretty sure they ship but with some stuff like heater boxes you
may want a reasonably rational person to look at said parts... if you
find that person I will give them a ride there! 
  Actually I will be going over soon to look up some heater boxes and
heater ducting for some list members... soooo 

                    have a good weekend all! Dan in Renton
