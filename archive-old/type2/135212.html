&gt;My question is, do I need to take the seal out and apply the paste that came
&gt;with the kit?

&gt;I don't want to install the calipers without the paste if it isn't already
&gt;there, but I also don't want to take it apart unnecessarily to check if it's
&gt;already in place.

Doesn't Bentley say it's ok to use brake fluid as well?

The paste has been very hard to locate for a long time...I tried as recently as a few months ago and ATE cancelled it from my order.
