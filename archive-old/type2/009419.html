Both lights blink together in our  1969 and 1972 buses. Dont worry because
that is the way the they work. Keep in mind if you notice that they suddenly
start blinking faster than normal it is because you have a light bulb burned
out in one of the turn signals. If they come on and stay on(no blink) then
check your flasher relay because it might be filled up with water from that
leaky windsheild of yours :)&gt;
