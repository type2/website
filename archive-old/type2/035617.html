Subject: Re: Fuel Injectors....New or Rebuilt

&gt;1: Replace only the # 2 injector with a new or rebuilt from NOPI / or
&gt;other....suggestions?
&gt;2: Replace all four injectors with new ones _at_ $75.00 ea
&gt;3: Replace all four injectors with Rebuilt ones _at_ $35.00 ea
&gt;4: Send my injectors off to somewhere like this Marren Motor Sports to
&gt;have my originals rebuilt/flow tested/matched/etc. _at_ approx $30.00 ea

STOP RIGHT THERE.

Around here NEW injectors (by Lucas but they are owned by Bosch now
after all) of the improved tip design are $28 each from Autozone or Advanced,
they typically got em on the shelf as they must be used in some early 80's
american stuff.

If BTW they don't list them, ask for the listing for a '81 federal 49 state
Vanagon, same injector, but I think Advanced it is doesn't keep the Bus
listing anymore whereas Autozone of course list the same part for both
years.

DON'T anyone out there run old injectors if you are doing a new engine,
$100 is nothing.  I would be willing to buy and send them to people BTW
if you don't have an Advanced or Autozone.

They injectors come with new seals but the quality is so so (I'd suggest
the ones from Bus Depot) and come with new correct style hose clamps.
Due to the improved tip design they don't seat quite as well BTW so you
need to make sure the ring main is correctly situated.  This is of course
also the time for new fuel hose around the ring, and replacement of the
engine tin grommet.
