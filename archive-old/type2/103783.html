Subject: Re: [T2] [BP] What is this-Is it a compressor??

Now you have me wondering and thinking about getting that thing, what ever 
it is, into my bus.
Notice the large heat sinks with nice sized SCRs attached to them.  Now 
that is an interesting twist.

What was the original ad that you found that in?

&gt;Since it's Friday, I thought I'd challenge the list geniuses to try to
&gt;figure this picture out. It looks to me like a homemade compressor, but why
&gt;would it be in a Bug? The more I look at it, the more confused I get. Look
&gt;at the electrical apparatus in there. It looks like too much work to be a
&gt;dummy, lots of wires etc.
