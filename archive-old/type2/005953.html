Hello Volks:
Last Sunday I finally talked my neighbor into going to a VW show with me and my son.  We packed up the '78 loaf with cooler, chairs, kids, etc., left early (0700) and got to San Jose Fairgrounds to find the show had been cancelled w/out any prior notice.  I know this because while we waited to see what would happen perhaps 50 other VW owners came and went, suffering the same situation.

On the way home my neighbor says: &quot;turn here, I take this shortcut everyday&quot; (he works in silicon valley, about 90 miles from here).  As I downshift off the exit I loose the clutch.  

My son crawls under and we jimmy a 22mm socket between the clutch wing nut and the stopper and still have no clutch.  I'm thinking &quot;pull-the-engine-and-replace-the-arm-that-supports-the-throwout-bearing&quot; time.  So, with incredible luck on my side (life truly is timing!) we drive the 25 miles home in second gear (25mph) without a single stop (remember this is California - land of stop signs); even crossed Hi-12 from the right shoulder across three lanes of traffic and made the left turn light!

I drove the F*ord Exploder all week, cursing my bad luck, as I had a '72 Westy in the garage and a '78 loaf on the street - neither of which I could use.

Spent the week finishing up the install of the fresh 2.0L AVP engine in my '72 Westy - got it running today!  I pulled the gas tank, had it cleaned and lined, changed every square inch of fuel hose (these postings on this list can sure get a body motivated to perform preventive maintenance), replaced the tank, put in the &quot;new&quot; engine, got a new battery, filled with oil, cranked it for 60 seconds solid.  Put gas in tank, cranked for 20 secs - nothing.  Checked spark and timing - all good.  No fuel in lines.  Off to gas station, got 2.5 gallons more fuel, poured into clean tank - BTW this put the fuel gauge just past the R.  Cranked engine for 30 seconds - nothing.  Did I mention the dual webers I have?  

Apparently those Webers take a lot of fuel.  Once I got the bowls filled with fuel (seemed like hours of cranking) the engine roared to life (and I mean ROARED!).

I also fixed the clutch problem on the '78 today.  Seems there are two bolts that hold a plate that the clutch cable passes through.  This &quot;holder&quot; is bolted into the tranney by two bolts and acts as sort of fulcrum.  One of the bolts had just sheared off - metal fatigue I suppose (I would recommend that everyone crawl under their Vans and replace those two bolts with stainless steel ones - I am as soon as I can find some).  Got an easy out, a drill, hammer and punch and went at it.  Once I got everything bolted back together (had to dig up a bunch of washers to adjust clutch - my son left the ones that were on there on the parking lot when he attempted to put the socket in to get us home a week ago) it ran fine!

Hey I'm 2 and O today.
