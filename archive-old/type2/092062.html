Subject: I got a little better at bondo

19 hours total,  lots of list wisdom and encouragement (thanks all), and
the nose is now satisfactory to me!  My learning curve on this stuff is
incredibly slow, but thankfully, the weather cooperated, and I had the
weekend free for once.  In those 19 hours, I also completely cleaned and
re-organized the garage, all my tools and the breezeway, and fixed a
small oil pressure problem on the 71.  Special thanks to Rich in RI for
offering to drive over an hour to come help me with it next weekend.

Now that I've gotten better at it, I want to know where the single cab
project with my name on it is :)

Thanks again to everyone that responded.
