Subject: Vacuum dizzy with Progressive Weber?

I got tired of the 009 in my 74 bus and scrounged a stock vacuum dizzy
(205n)

So here is the deal, the dizzy has to vacuum ports on it, I found one on
the car, right next to the choke element, it points right out towards the
back of the bus, has vacuum all the time, even at idle.  Is this the one
to use,  or should I look for another? Which port on the dizzy do I use,
the one on the outside of the vac can or the one on the inside?
If I only use one vac port should I plug the other?
Where should I time it?

Thanks,
Ed Maikranz
