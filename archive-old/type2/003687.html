&gt;so what should I do?  I need real!  heat and possible A/C, as well as as
many
&gt;modern conviences as possible.  what can i do?  shoudl I sell it?  or
shoudl
&gt;I get them  what can I get?  some one help me????!!!!!!


If these are the things you need, you do not want a Volkswagen Bus.
You might try a late-model Volkswagen Vanagon, as they will have many of
these modern conveniences.

You can get real heat, but it requires buying and installing an Eberspacher
gasoline heater.  You will have to troll the junkyards to find one and it
will probably cost you about $250-$400 and then you will have to install it.
Not easy.

You can get a/c, there was dealer-installed a/c on the air-cooled vans but
you will again be scrounging the junkyards and that must be a BIG job, there
are lots of parts throughout the car and you wouldn't believe what you have
to do to put the compressor drive belt on.  Additionally, the compressor
will rob lots of power from your already underpowered engine and as a result
your bus will be even slower and the engine won't live nearly as long.

It really sounds to me like you do not want a Volkswagen Bus.  Perhaps you
like the look and the character but when you talk about needing a/c and
other modern conveniences, I can tell a Volkswagen Bus is not for you.
