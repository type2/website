Subject: '77 Transporter Dual Circuit Brake Warning Light (DCBWL)

Howdy Volks!

My name is Bradley and I just got a 1977 Transporter!  It is definitley 
cool but I got some strange electrical goings on!  The DCBWL (see above, 
if you think I am going to type that every time! lol)  is acting strange. 
It is on all the time when I switch on the ignition.  My bona-fide 
service manual (came with the bus) syas nothing about the sucker being on 
all the time.  What is really strange is that when the emergency brake 
switch is depressed AND the brake pedal is depressed the light GOES OUT! 
Yes you heard me right!  Go figure!  Well, I thought about this and as 
far as I could tell there is either a problem with the master cylider, 
the switches mounted on it or the vacuum assisted servo.  It acts like it 
has its wires crossed and as far as I can tell all the wires are 
connected properly.  Any ideas or procedures to test this scenario?

BKD :)
