&gt;   Is it ok to ground
&gt; more than one thing at a single bolt on the chassis?
&gt;
&gt; thanks - Don
&gt;

Ground is ground, but beware.  If the bolt ever stops grounding to the chassis,
the juice will try to flow through the ground wires and cause all things
grounded to that bolt to do strange things.  I've never had any damage caused by
this, but have had some electrical components do funny things until I found the
problem.
