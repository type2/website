&lt;&lt; I saw Nizza brand tents on the second link below and was
wondering if anyone knows when they started making these? Were
they options for bays, vanagons, and euros? I have a friend who
has a couple of these and he wants to know what years of busses
they work best with. Any info would be appreciated!

Alex,

The Nizza tents have been available for about 4 years now.  Similar tents 
have been made  since the mid 60's.
