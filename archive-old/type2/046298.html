Subject: Re: [T2] torque for exhaust manifolds

Don't have any manuals handy, but i remember a piece in the Muir book the defines a way of judging tourque by watching how the tendons in your (Muir's) forearm react at a certain level.  Sort of like the Justin-Wilson exact-teaspoon-of-salt-in-the-palm-of-his-hand thing.

I'd bet it couldn't be more than 10-15 ft-lbs.
