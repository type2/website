Subject: Re: When the goin gets hot, the Hot get air conditioning!

Back in 1972, I bought a brand new 1972 bus with A/C.
It worked OK for here in the desert, but it froze my right ear off!
If I had to opt for A/C again, I think I'd go for an RV roof top swamp cooler.
You need the added moisture anyway. Except for in Florida, of course.
