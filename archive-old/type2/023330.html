X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL - A

He's asking about the South African Vanagon transaxles I bet.

I don't know if they will fit (somebody indicated they won't with much more 
detail than I know so I believe them) but I do know that a Porsche 901 5 
speed will fit and a lister has done it (check the archives, the recipe is 
there somewhere).

To the original question asker - you should know that lower rpms are going 
to result in lower cooling output by the fan and could lead to overheating. 
You should install GOOD instruments (and that is a whole other discussion 
thread) to be sure of your engine's health. There is a reason VW chose the 
rpm they did for highway cruising - a reasonable balance between cooling, 
noise, MPG, and engine longevity.

A hotter engine may (will probably) lead to a shorter life. Some will take 
exception to this but I bet it stands up statistically. &lt;grin&gt;

If you are in such a rush that 65 mph isn't enough then the older VW's 
might not be for you.

The archives are full of discussion threads on how to achieve better power, 
better sound proofing, and higher top gears. It's much like the tire thread 
- endless.

I plan on pursuing the 901 Porsche 5 speed but plan on keeping the top gear 
ratios about the same as OEM '78 VW Transporter. I don't seek speed or a 
big reduction in engine speed but I do want a greater selection of gears in 
the hills.

Keep us updated on your research, I love to learn more about it.

You might check with www.van-again_dot_com as they can supply the SA 5 speed if 
you can make it fit.
