&gt;Today I checked it and it was advanced 20 degrees at idle (900rpm).
&gt;I retarded it to 10 ATDC per Muir and then the old problems came back --

&gt;This didn't seem right to me at all, so I advanced it to TDC at idle.
&gt;I checked it at 3000 RPM and it's advanced 24 degrees. Power is back
&gt;and it idles fine when warm nows, but I'm back to wondering if this
&gt;is good for the engine or not. Does that advance curve sound scary?

*sigh*

Set it at 7.5 degrees BTDC.
Get the stock distributor as soon as you can.
Your engine will not blow up because of this in the next 250 miles.
