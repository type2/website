Neale,

This one is one of the first things we learn as bus owners, I assure you.
The second is that that 4-5 turn adjustment is a &quot;design feature.&quot; It is
there to give you enough time to get a new cable and get home to replace
it.  The way bay clutch cables fail is that a couple of strands break,
allowing the cable to stretch, then the rest of them break a couple of
hours/days later.

Get a new cable and replace that pup now!  I promise the job is lots more
pleasant in your driveway than on the side of the road.
