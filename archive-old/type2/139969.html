Subject: Turn Signals

Hey,

Any one know how fast the turn signals should blink?   After, installing my 
oil pressure gauge (I got for Xmas), I must have moved some wires. 

They blink much slower now (still work though), the relay is fairly new; I 
dont think its that.
Is &quot;safety regulation&quot; on how fast they blink?


Happy Trails,
