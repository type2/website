Subject: Motel &quot;Camping&quot; Gulf Shores, AL, show of hands?

Could I get a quick survey of people who might be -seriously- interested in taking over a Gulf Coast motel-on-stilts the weekend of Oct. 17-18-19?

Gulf Shores goes quite dead after the Shrimp Festival (this weekend) and rates fall like a stone, if we ganged up we could probably get rooms w/kitchens for around $25-30/night.
