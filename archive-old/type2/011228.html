Subject: Thanks from Wink, 1600 overheating problem

X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

Hello everyone
Last week (for almost 2 weeks) I was strnaded in Seattle, or really Federal 
Way, with a thrown rod for my 71 camper bus, 1600 dual port. Thanks to  help 
from the AIRS list, several local folks came to my aid and lent towing, 
talk, and support to help me out. Eventually I found my way to Oval's Motor 
Sports who installed a rebuilt 1600. After the test drive we discovered it 
was still overheating. After many suggestions and two or three more days, we 
found several things which helped with the heating problem. One of the 
biggest factors was there was a non-doghouse fan installed in my doghhouse 
fan housing. So we added a new fan (33% bigger) and a new oil cooler. Still 
running hot after that, though not as hot, we changed the coil to add some 
power, and plugged up remaing holes from non-existing heat riser tubes. We 
also added heater boxes back in place of my j-tubes in order to buffer the 
heat from the push rod tubes. It definitely runs cooler now, staying at 230 
to 235 according to the VDO oil temp gauge, and thats during the day, 85 
degrees or so. At night I'm running 220 or less.
Thanks so much to all, especially Oval's who endured the extra time and 
labor (at their expense) to help solve the problem.
I still would like to see cooler temps, and have a hunch that the deck 
height might be a little high. I'm getting 130 to 140 lbs compression and I 
had low compression pistons installed. Though within spec compression, maybe 
lower compression would lower temp.

I have noticed a little ticking sound however, which is worrying me a 
little. I'm hoping it is not a rod. I adjusted the valves, but that didn't 
change the sitution. maybe a stuck cam follower? i still have to check that. 
It seems to be coming from right side, and increases with rpms.
Thanks to terry and Fred from the AIRS list, as well as others who wrote in 
and called with suggestions.
wink, still on the road.
