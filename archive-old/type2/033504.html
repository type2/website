&gt; For years, I've known about the Nokia Tires (now known as Nokian) from
&gt; 
&gt; My Problem (same for most Vanagon/Bus 14&quot; wheel owners) is getting heavy
&gt; duty 14&quot; tires with the load carrying rating required by Vanagons and
&gt; Busses in the new special studdless rubber compounds.  Almost all of the
&gt; best 14&quot; versions are light weight passenger tires or are meant for ice
&gt; but not deep snow..   I needed both ice and deep snow abilities.

I have been running Michelin 205 R70/14 MXT  all season radials on my 78
for a while now, I am a ski instructor so I get into some pretty snowy
areas here in the East.  these tires have a 99S weight rating, 1750lbs or
so.

they have been great in the bad weather, and are about $100 per tire, but
the wider base helps with the stability of our vans too.  They are a
special order tire but mine came in in about a week.  I got em from NTB.
