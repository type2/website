Subject: FS 79 CA Exhaust &amp; Engine parts

In case you haven't noticed I have been doing some VW house cleaning in
the past several weeks.  More has to go.

This is the same engine I advertised earlier as for sale.  I'm glad no
one bought it.  I finally got an oil pressure gauge on it and it wasn't
good.

So parts are available.  I imaging the internals, lifters, cam, crank
are probably not good.  But if you want them you can have them for the
cost of shipping.  Same for the block.

I have a complete 79 California exhaust, from the heads out.
Heat exchangers all good, Muffler good, Cat. Good, Square exhaust ports.

System works well.  I want to ship the system whole.  The only bolts
turned are the one on the heads.  Just bolt it right on your heads. You
can even have the O2 sensor, which also works.
Asking $300 + shipping OBO

The heads are good.  Compression is 150 all the way around.  1 stud
needs replacing.
Asking $250 OBO + shipping for the set.

Also available are the piston and cylinders.  Also a 77 set
asking $100 OBO + shipping per set  Or both sets for $150 OBO + shipping

Flywheel, clutch, disc, 2 complete sets both 228 MM
$75 OBO for each set.

Pointless Distributor (stock) $50 + shipping OBO. No ICU, but you can
have the ICU harness

Tin is available for the cost of shipping.

FI system is not for sale right now.   If your interested let me know
and I'll get back to you if it becomes available.
