Subject: Re: [T2] Metal fuel line

Bill,

I'm still fighting that one in my 78 that sat for 8 years.

Yes, the black goo is gasoline turned to &quot;varnish&quot;.  It can get hard as
rock(or harder) and the only thing I found that would dissolve it was
lacquer thinner(very slowly).  Lacquer thinner is probably bad for every
other part in your fuel system and highly explosive.

I dissasembled/replaced *everything* that was touched by it, except the
gas tank.....wishing I had done it also now, but it required removing the
engine and I wasn't ready for that yet.

Cheers, dave

&gt; &gt; I was replacing some fuel lines and reinstalling my fuel pump yesterday.
&gt; &gt; I noticed that the metal line that is above the tranny is
&gt; &gt; rusted real bad. I was going to use a piece of brake line, but wanted to
&gt; &gt; make sure that will be ok first. Do they sell metal fuel
&gt; &gt; line in lengths like brake line?
&gt; 
&gt; My van has been sitting for a few years and I just started to work on it
&gt; again...
&gt; 
&gt; There's some rubber hose that been used for the fuel line (was interim
&gt; solution to shut off flow of gas so filter could be easily changed; I've got
&gt; the rusty gas tank problem)
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, I just discovered that some of it is clogged with black goo.  Does
&gt; this sound like the remains of old gas/rust or has the gas reacted with the
&gt; hose (black colored) and soldified?
&gt; 
&gt; I hope it's only the hose because that's easy to replace.  I'd hate to have
&gt; to unclog the the line further because it's really tough stuff.  Has anyone
&gt; else had this problem?
