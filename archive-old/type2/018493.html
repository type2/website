um, *what* underside tin? There's supposed to be underside tin...that comes off?

&gt; you can *hear* a spitting (fitzing) sound at the HE if it's leaking. I'm not good at hearing this, so I tend to ask Ken to come over and listen. I've got the problem now myself.

&gt; As for the 3/1 cylinders, you might keep in mind that they share some cam lobes. I hope you don't have a cam problem, but it makes sense to be aware of the relationship.

Cam problem isn't out of the question. What I know of the bus' history: it sucked a #3 exhaust valve which ended up destroying the piston and cylinder. I suppose some tragedy could have happened to the cam as well. PO
tossed a GEX head on the beast and the rest is history.

How would I go about diagnosing a cam problem? Would this be a fatal problem, meaning &quot;go directly to jail, do not pass go, wait there until you pull the rebuilt engine card&quot; or would it simply be terminal, a la Ben
Gazzara, 6 months to live?
