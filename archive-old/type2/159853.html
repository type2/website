&gt; And now,  to all of you, I thank you for your concern for the hubcap.    
&gt; Since I sort of created this situation by not following through on  my  
&gt; plans to take it to Havasu this past January, I am stepping up to  the  
&gt; plate and will take care of it without involving any of  you.  Stay  
&gt; tuned to the VW community and you will find out  where and when the  
&gt; Infamous Hubcap re-surfaces!     ;-)

hey guys  Kinda what I figure would happen sounds like he doesn't need  or
want us involved LOL   Did somebody just appoint this guy to be the 
Hubcap GOD
or did he just appoint himself   :)   later  Mark  D

Actually, it sounds like he feels guilty that it got this far in the 
conversation and he's going to fix the problem without involving 
everyone else (could also be read: burdening everyone else with the 
issue).  Sounds like he's making an effort to see it continue on its 
journey - kudos!

Mike
