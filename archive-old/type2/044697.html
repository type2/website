Subject: [T2] Events in WV, OH, PA?

I remember some sort of Westy club in West Virginia that had an event last 
year that I was (unfortunately) unable to attend.  I think it was held in 
Parkersburg, West Virginia, some time in October.
I haven't seen anything sort of local mentioned this year (great bus-no 
problems, but that darn FI system kind of scares me-don't want to wonder too 
far), and wondered if anything was planned for this year.  I work a goofy 
schedule, but hopefully this year I'd be able to make it.
Does anyone know if any sort of event is planned for this year in 
north/central WV, eastern OH, or western PA?
Also, is there anyone close to Wheeling, WV on the list?
Thanks,
Greg 
Moundsville, WV
