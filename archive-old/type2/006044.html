I believe the EGR valve on a '78 is mechanical and part of (attached to) the
air distribution box.  If it's still hooked up there'd be an arm that
attaches from it to the throttle lever.  Prior to '76 (or so) I think it was
an electronic widget above cylinder 4.

The decel valve is a three vacuum hose metal diaphragm looking thing screwed
to the firewall.

Also, you can't adjust the mixture on a fuel injected bus without a CO
meter.

Good luck,
Christopher Darilek

&gt;
&gt; so i'm on this mission to get my new bus up and running and have been
&gt; spending my spare time staring at the engine and books and just looking
for
&gt; problems to fix.  i've checked out a bunch of stuff so far, and after
&gt; today's work i have the pleasure of reporting that my bus, which was
bought
&gt; without the ability to idle, is idling!!! now, the there are still
problems,
&gt; mainly the fact that the idle is rough, doesn't adjust well when the idle
&gt; screw is turned, and she's running hot and smokey!!
&gt; so there are still problems, but at least i have an idle to work with.
&gt;
&gt; now, i'm still waiting for the bentley manual so in the meantime i'm using
&gt; chilton's and muir.   from reading the material given, which is sparse for
a
&gt; '78 bus, i am led to believe that the EGR valve and deceleration valve
need
&gt; checking.  big problem!!! i can't find either in my engine!  supposedly
the
&gt; EGR valve should be pretty much on top of #4 cylinder, but all i have
there
&gt; is a metal tube coming from the throttle area that disapears into the tin.
&gt; so where are these mysterious components?  i want to see and touch them.
&gt;
&gt; and also, can anyone give me a push in the right direction as far as what
my
&gt; problem might be?  basically rough idle, gray/white smoke coming out of
the
&gt; exhaust that is very hot....
&gt;
&gt; and finally, (i'm a very curious fellow....), how is the screw in the air
&gt; sensor adjuste, or should it be left alone?  i read about it enriching or
&gt; leaning out the air or something............
&gt;
&gt; thanks in advance.....
&gt;
&gt; mark.
