&gt; Hi Clark,
&gt; 
&gt; It depends on which idiot light switch you use.  My
&gt; original VW switch comes on at 4.5 psi, the VDO at 10
&gt; psi.  I use the VW switch because I just don't like to
&gt; see that red light come on at hot idle.

Good point, man.
I picked up the 7.5 number from browsing this list over the past couple years
and was subscribing to the 'deutsche methode' way of thinking that implies
that VW set the pressure switch to the absolute minimum oil pressure and that
one should never see the light unless something is seriously wrong.
I have no idea what pressure my 1800 type4 runs, but if that light stays on
more than a second after starting, i start to get tense...  maybe 'cause i
built the engine.
I never see the light at hot idle, but the engine is &lt;3000 miles into it's
first 'real' oil change...

running with stock indicators,
clark in Ky.

  I'm probably
&gt; running 7.5 psi for HIOL.  I think most rebuilders
&gt; hope that owners don't have accurate oil pressure
&gt; gages, because I haven't found one that will guarantee
&gt; what your HIOP will be.
