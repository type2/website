Hi all,

     I was out looking at the worn tracks on my AFM &amp; decided I needed a new
one along with other factors.  While I was looking I noticed a fuel leak at
the hose connection for the cold start valve.  No big deal I will just
change all the hoses while I am at it.  While I am removing the hose form
the valve the plastic end brakes off.  My day just got more expensive.  I
will order the valve &amp; rebuilt AFM from Bus Depot on Monday but in the mean
time my bus is down.  Oh, I also broke one of the plastic vacuum lines while
making room to break (I mean fix) my cold start leak.  Thank you for letting
me vent a little.
