&lt;&lt;What is the original color of the under color. 
For those of us who want to do a ground up resto knowing only the exterior
color and interior color does not help when it comes to the under carriage.
Are they all the same or do they vary according to exterior colors. 
My bus would is mouse grey.
Any help would be appreciated!

The under color would likely be primer gray.  I recently removed the
undercoating under my '74 and found that the frame rails were the same color
as the body, and the cross members and underside of the floor were primer
gray.  I repainted everything gloss black.
