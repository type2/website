Subject: RE: [VB] For all those DIYer's

Rick,

Put some very long rod on your bench sticking straight up, as you take off
washers and nuts stick then on the rod so that they stack on top of each
other.  As you put the engine back together you will know which nut goes
back first since they are in FILO order.
