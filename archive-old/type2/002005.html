Subject: more on GAS in oil

well hello again....

well i figured out why i lacked power after changing the oil this morning.
when i pulled the plugs to check them out, i forgot to reattach the wire to
#1 spark plug, so that's not the prob, wasn't the prob that caused the gas
in oil either cuz i remember pulling it off to check the plug.


my little bro who fried my timing light went and bought me another, and i've
been futzing with the timing and here's what i found:

(again, this is '77 loaf with 2.0L FI hyd.lifter)

- started the bus, set it at 7.5 BTDC

- decided to see if it advances properly, revved the throttle, it advanced
to around 35 BTDC which i believe is correct.

- let off the throttle and timing returned to about 12 BTDC, engine idles a
bit faster with the more advanced timing

- readjusted idle timing to 7.5 BTDC

- checked advance again, now it advances to about 25-30 BTDC, returns to 7.5

if i pull backwards on the throttle (closing it) i can get the timing to
come a couple degrees after 7.5 (maybe 4-5 BTDC now)

this makes me think that since the ign isn't advanceing all the way and
sometimes returns too retarded, that the improper timing is letting the fuel
get into the oil.

so what's wrong with the ign??  is something wrong with my throttle body?
(the vacuum advance connects to the side of the throttle body and the air
filter). I've tried tightening the spring on top of the plenum before and
that made things worse (that was months and months ago)

or should i rebuild my distributor? i ordered a distributor rebuild kit from
bus depot, but i have no idea what to do with it. it just looks like a bunch
of washers and a couple felt pads. Is there a procedure anywhere on the net
for rebuilding the dizzy??

thanks for the replies to my previous post, but i don't have a fuel pressure
tester, and i don't have ANY money WHATSOEVER to buy one. i had a bad
pressure regulator before, and when that was the prob, the bus wouldn't even
start.

can i test injectors for leaking by pulling all 5, pulling the wires off
them, and operating the fuel pump, placing paper towels under them to see if
they get wet? does that work??

thanks again!
