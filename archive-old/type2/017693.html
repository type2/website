Eric,
  Everyone says that you have to drop the motor to get the gas tank out.  After
having removed my gas tank from my '78 (with the engine out) and after
replacing the fuel filler neck (with the engine in), I am under the impression
that the tank can be removed without dropping the engine.  Do note, I'm sure it
would be a considerable pain in the ass, but I bet it could be done.  Also, if
I'm not mistaken, the '77 came with a 2.0L fuel injected engine.  My $.02...

&gt; I have a '77 Westy with a 1600cc upright in it. My fuel tank is rusted
&gt; beyond all recognition, with the usual undesirable consequences. I recently
&gt; acquired a new fuel tank, fixed it up thoroughly (and then spent a very
&gt; long time removing tank sealant from the fuel line hookups I forgot to
&gt; plug), and took it to my mechanic in order to save some time. My mechanic
&gt; sat on it for two weeks before discovering that he would have to remove the
&gt; engine to get to the fuel tank, and then refused to do it. Nashville's best
&gt; known VW mechanic, Paul Shirley, having retired, I called a place in a
&gt; neighboring town I had heard about. They informed me that they mostly do
&gt; bugs and wouldn't touch a bus fuel tank job &quot;because you gotta take the
&gt; motor out&quot;.
&gt;
&gt; Now I'm out of options other than doing it myself. Problem is, I know these
&gt; later model tanks have more lines coming out of them to accommodate the
&gt; dual carbs on the original motor. I'm sure I can figure out what goes where
&gt; by observing the existing tank, but I don't know how to plug the extra
&gt; lines. What should I use?
&gt;
&gt; TIA,
&gt; Eric
