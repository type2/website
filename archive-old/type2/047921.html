Subject: Re: [T2] Sunroof opening/poptops

Buses came stock with sunroofs that big, I have one myself in my '77...the
poptop hole is a completely defferent situation altogether. IF you would
like the poptop to be JUST like the late poptops, you will need to do some
cutting.

BUT, a sunroof bus is getting to be rare....my opinion is keep the sunroof
bus stock and in working order, buy a Westy if you really want another
camper that bad...if not, let me know what you want for the sunroof bus, I
have been looking for another one for quite a while...

Just my  .02.....

&gt; I have been a subscriber for some time and have not seen any posts
&gt; regarding sunroof openings.
&gt; I have a 76 transporter that I am in the process of restoring, I would
&gt; like to turn it into a poptop if possible and have a couple of
&gt; questions..  It has a sunroof that measures approx 3' x 3'8&quot;. Is this
&gt; the same size opening that a poptop has? if so has anyone ever seen this
&gt; done before?? I just ordered a new engine from Bus Depot yesterday and
&gt; asked them they said they hadn't seen a bus with such a big sunroof.. Is
&gt; this thing stock ?? It sure looks it ..Lastly am   I    crazy to attempt
&gt; this at all  ( Don't answer that one I already know the answer)
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance
