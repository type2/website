Subject: RE: [T2] Sad News

oddly enough I was working on the wife's Honda, starter prob... crossed the
starter with a screw driver .. ohh it started alright and then somehow
jumped in gear(its an automatic) and drove down a hill with me in front of
it for 30+ ft, until it was stopped by a big ol tree, If it had missed that
tree the next one that it would have hit was gonna have me between the two!
I am thankful to be here and sorry to hear about glen.
Ian

&gt;    Hey Friends,   Sad news came to town yesterday.  Tues  evening Glen,
&gt;the brewmaster at the wild duck was killed in a tragic  accident.  The man
&gt;who brought you Spankdog, Sasquatch, Glen's Special  Bitter that fabulous
&gt;Russian Imperial Stout and many other fine brews is no  longer with us. 
&gt;There was a shrine set up and bitter flowing yesterday at  the WD. 
&gt;Thought you might want to stop by the Duck and have a beer for  Glen.  
&gt;For those Volkswagen owners among  us.....please, please be careful
&gt;climbing under your bus with a screwdriver  heading for the starter.  
&gt;It's a great day to be alive!   Rex  
&gt;
