Subject: Re: [T2] Let's start an oil war - oberg

John and list, I'm getting mixed info. I'm being told by some that oil filters actually filter finer than the oberg?? Is this true John? Do you know what micron filtration the Amsoil you sell is compared to the Holley/Oberg? Seems like it would be a waste of time if the oil filter does a better job??
