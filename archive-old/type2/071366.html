Hiya Alan,

I just went through the same situation with my 70 Bus.  Those little 
headaches after driving for a half hour or so were not fun.  When I got my 
Bus (last August) the muffler was shot.  There were exhaust leaks all over 
the place.  I only drove the Bus with the windows wide open.  
So..................
I replaced my old worn out muffler with a brand new one (alas, for a Bug) so 
I had the opportunity to check out the rest of the exhaust system while under 
the Bus.  I removed the heat exchangers (not really hard at all) and cleaned 
them out.  Everything was in great shape.  Closed the windows and went for a 
drive.  Seemed OK,  but I felt a little woozy after an hour or so.  Got my 
wife (otherwise known as the nose) out in the Bus.  &quot;Geez, it smells like 
exhaust in here&quot;!  Back to the drawing board.
I asked the list about this situation.  The recommendations?  Get rid of the 
Bug exhaust.  I did that.  Replaced it with a stock Bus exhaust.  Replace the 
cargo door seal.  I'm still awaiting the arrival of that little number at my 
FLAPS.  
You see, what's supposed to be happening is this................  exhaust 
gases collect at the back of the bus as it travels forward.  This is due to a 
vortex effect which is formed at the back of the bus by the air moving 
quickly past the sides, top and bottom.  The exhaust from my Bug muffler was 
trapped against the back of the bus.  OK (maybe) if you have a good seal on 
the cargo door.  I didn't.  The gas was making it's way in the cabin past 
that crummy seal.
So I changed the muffler.  It now dumps the exhaust out to the side and the 
seal should keep out any gasses which are still trapped behing the Bus.
My advice would be to check that rear cargo door seal.
