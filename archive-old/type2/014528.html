Hi all,
Does anyone out there, have an old flat rate manual for mechanical shop
times?
I am negotiating with VW for the price to get my valves done.
They are claiming 10 hours to R&amp;R the engine, plus the price of R&amp;Ring
the heads, plus the price of the valve job, plus, plus, plus.
I'm telling them it should take no more than 8 hours to remove and
replace the engine and heads, especially since the guy doing it is a
Deutschlander, who has done it more than once in his life, the only
problem is he is a perfectionist, and is quoting big times to cover is
dupa.

They are quoting me out of a Vanagon Flat rate book, and this isn't
correct.

Thanks for the help,

Later,
