No motor, good tranny, some camper parts included. windshield out, but
included. extra popouts. Whel wells modified. Fairly straight body, some
rust of course. Small crease right front. Both rear quarters need work.

Though it belong to a friend, I've only seen pictures of it. Long time not
driven. Can be dollied.

I know nothing else..will only be here 3 more days if you need something
specific checked...so best bet is to call owner : Dave, 904-848-3009. $700
or B.O.
