Subject: [T2]Distributor Choice?????Help!!

Hi everybody,
I recently got my rebuilt engine mostly assembled and into my 71'
Westy.  These are my engine specs:
1600ccDP
totally stock except for--100 cam, full flow, heavyduty valve springs,
header exhaust w/ single quiet pack, dual weber 40 DCNF's.

I have read the recent articles in VWT about ignition timing
and distributors.  I have also searched the archives and even read
boston engine's article on the 009(which I have)  Almost all the
articles I read reccomend against the 009. Muir i belive promotes its
use.  I most likely will not use the 009.  My question is which
distibutor should I use? Someone told me the vacuum signal from the dual
carbs would
throw off the vacuum advance dist. I also read that certain
dist. have an adjustable vacuum canister.  Why dist. do you guys use?
does anyone have the part # of the dist. that would work for me the
best? Any response will be greatly appreciated.

Brian 71 westy
