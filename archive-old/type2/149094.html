Subject: Clara's question in re: VB list

While it's still Friday, can we entertain Clara's question about 
recombining the lists? Or maybe permitting all air-cooled bus 
discussion on this list, without the 67/68 division. If the admins 
accepted the latter, the VB list could stay up for anyone who can't 
handle the traffic or loathe baywindows.

I miss the VB people, Clara especially.

Mark
