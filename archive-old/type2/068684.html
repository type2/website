I put a lock on my '66's engine room door.

I recently ordered, received and installed a locking latch
from RMMW.  Cost about 15$US and was a snap to install.
Came with two keys.  

I thought the original was of higher quality and had a more
massive feel to it, and the keys are not exactly the highest
quality, but it does the job.  

Its probably possible to install the locking portion of the 
unit in the original mechanism, but I didn't try that.
