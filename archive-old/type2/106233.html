Subject: FREE westy interior

sorry about that. sent it too soon.

anyway, i was planning on giving away an early bay style
westy interior at EB2003, but i wasn't able to make it.

so, i am offering, to the first person that comes &amp; picks
it up at my house, a free interior for your bus.

includes:
-rear cushion
-z-bed
-suicide cabinet
-folding table

i live in Cary, NC (near Raleigh).

contact me if you are interested.
