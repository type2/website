&gt; Bill,
&gt; 	I got from an old guys place awhile ago a homemade tool... He had taken a
&gt; spark plug and removed the porcelain and centre, then welded a shaft and
&gt; T-bar to the top, cut a slot through the remaining body of the plug along
&gt; the length of the threads with a hacksaw, that is across the threads. But
&gt; wait, theres more. Then (if you were doing it up into a head) he had
&gt; carefully filed the LEADING side down a bit, thus presenting an effective
&gt; cutting edge as it screwed down. I used it on an alloy head in a Toyota and
&gt; it recut a fine thread. Cheap good tool. I would try that first. Alignment
&gt; is the key to success.

I have and use one of these.  They're called a &quot;thread chaser&quot; and are
meant to clean out the existing threads.  It's very handy when carbon
buildup causes the plugs to be hard to remove.  I chase the threads
whenever the plugs come out and have yet to strip one.

I make mine from a long-reach plug.  Remove the ceramic insulator (big
hammer) and the crush washer.  Use a hacksaw to make two cuts at 90
degrees to each other along 3/4 the length of the threads.  Use a small
triangular file to clean up any burrs made by the saw, but don't taper the
edge of the threads at the cuts.  You want them to scrape the carbon
buildup without harming the metal.  Finally, bend each of the four
quadrants out about a mm or so, so that each segment will be pressed
against the head threads by a little &quot;spring action&quot;.  The tool may be
used with a plug wrench.  Simply run it in and out once and it'll clean
things up nicely.

Now be warned:  this device is a great cleaning tool for preventive
maintainance, but it won't fix threads that have been stripped.  Once the
metal is gone, it's gone forever and it's insert time!
