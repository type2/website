&gt; Good question about the speedometer, I had to replace the cable once because

If your roads have mile markers it is easy to check your speedometer.
Find a straight level stretch and drive the bus through one mile at 60MPH
indicated.  Measure the time required to do this.  

If it takes longer than 60 seconds then the speedometer is reading high by
the number of seconds more than 60.  

If it's less than 60 seconds, then the speedometer is reading low by the
number of seconds less than 60.

here's an example:

the bus takes 64 seconds to traverse the measured mile.  Since this is
more than 60, then the speedometer is reading high by 64-60= 4MPH,
therefore the true speed is 56MPH

(purists will notice that this method is approximate, but as long as you
are off by less than 20% it will work OK!)

Of course, if you have a friend with a GPS, or a friendly cop with a radar
gun, you simply measure the speed and compare!  I'm willing to bet that
your speed is closer to 60MPH at an indicated 70.

My bus would blow a bit of oil regardless of speed until I put in a fresh
engine.  It's a function of the random leaks and the amount of blowby.  My
fresh Mexican engine doesn't seem to use any oil at all.  Strange to see a
dry underside!  :)
