&gt; I am looking for anyone who might hve any useful infrmation about
&gt; convrtig a 1961 VW bus int an automatic transmission. I am also
ordering
&gt; a new engine as well probable from GEX. If you or anyone you know has
&gt; done something like this before and wouldn't mind sharing some
&gt; information about it with me I would be very grateful- Thaks very much

Auto trans: no info

New engine from GEX:  Apparently GEX is now buying factory new engines
&gt;from Beetlemex, adding the distributor drive gear, &quot;hot testing&quot; them
(whatever that means) and selling them.

Their price is a bit more than Beetlemex, but the real kicker is the
$190 core charge that they've added.  My experience with GEX's
handling of cores leads me to believe that getting that $190 back from
them will be a challenging experience.

IMO, you're a lot better off buying the engine direct from Beetlemex.
