Brent, I will suggest that Gene Berg has the compression ratio topic nailed
in a very nice technical article available at their web site. A good many
other basic/detailed tech articles are also available. They also, back in
the DOS days, had a program on disc for doing any and all calcs. They are a
fine, fine, super fine resource for bullet proof parts and info.
