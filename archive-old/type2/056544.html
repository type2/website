Subject: IMPORTANT! Yes, the list *is* down!

Volks,

In a probably vain attempt to forestall the inevitable flood of &quot;Is the
list down?&quot; posts, this is to inform you that, yes, the list *is* down.

The problem appears to be that mail is getting as far as the azaccess
server, but is being stopped and held there.  Mail sent from within
azaccess is still propagating, so there is nothing wrong with the list
itself, it's just not getting your posts.  *Please* be patient!

Please, before you send an &quot;Is the list down?&quot; post consider how many
people you are/will be upsetting.  About the only question such a post
will *not* answer is the one you are asking.  Any such posts received 
after this propagates will be considered grounds for at least moderation 
if not absolute banishment!
