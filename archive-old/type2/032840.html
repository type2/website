Subject: Cleaning heat exchangers

In preparation for finally taking Peregrine to be smogged, I am going 
over every inch of the exhaust system. I decided to pry the cover of the 
heat exchanger apart to clean the oil out of them, grind the rust, and 
hammer out the dings and dents.

Inside I found an aluminum heat shield and a piece of fabric that looks 
like heavy burlap, but may be made of asbestos? It was, as you can 
imagine, soaked in oil. I boiled it in TSP, and a LOT of oil came out. I 
don't think that this would have every &quot;burned&quot; out through regular 
driving. If your heat smells like oil, you may want to do a similar 
cleaning.
