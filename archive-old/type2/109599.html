Subject: Re: [T2] Pertronix install question

Do I keep the condensor?(what does the condensor do anyways?)
&gt;
&gt; no. It goes away. Plus the little plug attached to it that the points
&gt; hook to will need to be removed. But do keep it &amp; a condensor in the
&gt; bus just in case. I haven't had a problem w/ the 3 units I have, but I
&gt; always keep some points (&amp; condensor) handy just in case.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Any
&gt; &gt; install tips?

Here's two:  I used a fine file (gently!) to get the little round puck
seated on the distributor shaft.  It would not have gone w/o the (minor)
filing.  Also, don't reinstall the condensor attachment screw into the body
of the distributor in an attempt to plug the hole, as I did, or it will
interfere with the internals of the distributor, and cause you to think that
there is something very wrong with your new 009.  AMHIK.  Yes, I know that
the 009 is frowned-upon, but on my 1600DP it works well and is okay so far
until I get a proper vac-advance unit.  Flame if you must.
