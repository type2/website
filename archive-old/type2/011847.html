Hi Volks!

&gt; Signing off the list for a week as I'm leaving for Germany.  I've got a lot
&gt; planned for this trip and it will be difficult to get it all in a week.
&gt; 
&gt; I will hit the auto show in Frankfurt for about a day and a half and then I'm
&gt; hoping to head up to Salzgitter and campout with the German Bulli group.

This far he made it, I'm happy to testify.  :-)  Our autumn
meet, &quot;Schicht im Schacht&quot;, was a great success (by our
standards) with a total of sixty-one buses attending.  Highlight
was a Hannover (Transporter) factory tour on Monday, to which
Steve unfortunately didn't make it (if I'm informed correctly,
not having joined it myself).  Next meet is scheduled April 9-11
if I remember correctly; any Listees coming to the area then
(or indeed anytime), holler!

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
