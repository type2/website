&gt; Please when you get a chance - I would love to see the info!

&gt; 
&gt; But how to pump the water around without a bunch of pulleys....

West Marine Catalog has dozens of 12v water pumps I am sure the right one
could be found.....also if done right it could even be gravity feed, I
have gravity circulated hot water heat in my house...no pumps at all

&gt; &gt;I have a 1958 Berkeley which is a fiberglass bodied car powered by an 
&gt; &gt;aircooled motorcycle engine.  Somewhere I have a diagram that someone drew 
&gt; &gt;showing a rig to heat a Berk with a water system, the water heated by the 
&gt; &gt;exhaust.  If you are interested, send me your address and I will hunt it 
&gt; &gt;up and make a copy for you.  If it worked in a Berkeley it ought to work 
&gt; &gt;in a VW.  I had forgotten all about the old rig until you asked.
