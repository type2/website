Todd Heckeler sends:

&gt; I was wondering if anyone could help me out. I'm having a heck of a
&gt; time finding someone who will insure me for my 79 Westfalia. I have
&gt; given them terms like type II, Westfalia, Campmobile, camper, but
&gt; they are unable to insure it. Can anyone tell me who they are insured
&gt; with?

Did you try &quot;Volkswagen bus?&quot;
