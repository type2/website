Ron,

     Every Type 4 engine bus I ever had has needed that fan taken apart &amp;
lubed.  It is a easy task.  I usually do this once a year just to keep it
running smooth.

&gt; Howdy - Are there any Listees out there who have replaced the blower
&gt; motor on their '76? I've detemined that the relay for the motor works
&gt; and 12 V is present on the motor wires, but it doesn't turn. If I nudge
&gt; the blower fan (with a tool - lots of torque here!), it will turn over
&gt; for a few revs and stop again. The blower cage has VW/Audi p/n 261 261
&gt; 193A, AEG L76A2570365, but I can't identify a separate number for the
&gt; motor.
&gt;
&gt; Any help appreciated - chilly mornings, etc.
&gt;
&gt; Thank you,
&gt;
