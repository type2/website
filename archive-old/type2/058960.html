Subject: Oil/additives?

At the risk of starting another long, multifaceted thread, what's everyone running for oil
and/or additives these days?  My mechanic, a 25 year VW guy, swears that 30 wt. in the
summer and 20 wt. in the winter is the best for a bus air-cooled engine, but of late I
have heard that there is maybe something out there that would be better.  I'm currently
running a '77 2.0, converted from FI to a Weber 2bbl.  Any ideas?
