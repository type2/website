Subject: 5-22 VW Campout in Lanesboro, MN

Last fall a small group of VW enthusiasts banded together for a campout
in Lanesboro, MN.  Despite a persistent drizzle, these intrepid souls
constructed a common shelter and were rewarded with the sight of a double
rainbow.  It was then determined that future gatherings would be designated
as the &quot;Over the Rainbow Campout.&quot;

We are happy to announce that the 2004 VW Over the Rainbow Campout is just
ahead!

Date: Saturday and Sunday, May 22-23, 2004

Location: Eagle Cliff Campground at Lanesboro, MN
130 miles southeast of the Twin Cities, an easy 2 1/2 hour drive

Time: Noon Saturday through Sunday afternoon

Join us for a fun weekend in the scenic Bluff Country along the Root River
of southeastern Minnesota. We will camp in our own section of a
well-equipped private campground. Facilities include shaded campsites with
electrical hook-ups, picnic tables and fire pits, heated bathrooms with
showers, covered picnic shelter, and playground.

This time we will camp in our own secluded section, on the banks of the
scenic, cliff-rimmed, Root River.  A few sites have electricity, so bring
extension cords.

Activities in the immediate area include 60 miles of paved bike trails,
fishing,
rafting, canoeing, and tubing along the Root River.  All equipment is
available for rent if you choose not to bring your own.  Substantial
shopping
opportunities (including Amish goods) abound in historic Lanesboro and
nearby communities.

experience.

Although we anticipate a much shorter journey, some of us have been known to
get lost, and others may simply enjoy exploring the winding byways along our
route.

directed to our special camping area.

The campground website is www.eaglecliff-campground_dot_com  Please check this
for specific campground directions and information.

All Vanagon, Eurovan and VW Bus enthusiasts are welcome. You need not even
arrive in a VW; fellowship, not rules, is the primary concern.  Tent sites
are available in our group area, rv sites are nearby, and lodging is
available both at the campground and in nearby Lanesboro. If you can't come
for the entire event, please drop in whenever you can. Bring your own food,
firewood, and all other preferred gear and equipment. Grocery, hardware, and
numerous other stores and eating establishments are located in Lanesboro.

chip cookies may again be available.

available, so late responses or even drop-ins are welcome. Please feel free
