Subject: PLEASE SAVE THIS MESSAGE

type2 is devoted to discussion of the care, feeding, breeding and grooming
of the aircooled Volkswagen Transporter, c. 1950-1983, and the eccentric
characters who drive it. This list is safe for use in the proximity of
children, pets and elderly persons when used as directed.

Subscription instuctions follow, but before subscribing please do note that
this is a high-volume list. A typical day might see traffic on the order of
100K bytes. If you aren't prepared to deal with this kind of mail volume,
an alternative is to read the list when you have time from the Hypermail
archive on Skip Montanaro's web page:

http://www.automatrix_dot_com/~skip/volkswagen

If you wish to subscribe, note that there is a real-time option and a
digest option. In digest, the server saves list mesages until they reach a
threshold of about 32K, then sends you one large message containing many
smaller ones. The digest is strongly suggested if you:

1. Get your email through AOL, Compuserve, NetCruiser or Prodigy, which
have suffocating restrictions on mailbox volume.

2. Are new to the Internet and aren't used to dealing with colossal amounts
of data--it's a learned skill.

3. Are subscribing from work and your boss might geek over the disk space
and the distraction.

Okay, then, let's do it:

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

To subscribe to the type2 list in real time, send this message:

  subscribe type2

to this address:

  majordomo_at_primenet_dot_com

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

To subscribe to the list in digest mode, send this message:

  subscribe type2-digest

to this address:

  majordomo_at_primenet_dot_com

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

To post to the list, send your public message to this address:

  type2_at_primenet_dot_com

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

To switch from real-time to digest, send this message:

  unsubscribe type2
  subscribe type2-digest

to this address:

Here's the drill: VW content is obligatory.  FS and WTB ads are allowed.
Trip reports are allowed even if they ramble. Show announcements are
allowed. Posts by vendors are allowed unless they are outright spam. If
your message concerns watercooled busses as well as aircooled ones, feel
free to cross-post to the Vanagon list--the two lists maintain a symbiotic
relationship. All rules will be routinely bent. ;)

On Fridays, things tend to be loosen up some and the music tends to be kind
of loud. VW content is still obligatory, but Friday is the day for jokes,
rants, waxing poetic, and so forth. Newbies should not be alarmed by this,
it's perfectly normal. ;)

Be specific in your subject line. We want to know your problem and your
year of manufacture--put them in the header. A fuel-injected 82 is a lot
different from a barndoor.

If mail from the list to you starts bouncing, I may unsubcribe you without
telling you. If the list mysteriously stops coming, this is probably what
happened.

Please do not post automated server commands to the list.
Please do not post &quot;test&quot; messages to the list.
Please do not post messages with attachments to the list.
Please do not post messages in any other character set than US-ASCII.
Please be judicious in quoting other messages. Cut quotes to the bone.

Folks who are having trouble can send mail to my human address, which is

bighouse_at_socomm_dot_net

and we'll fix it up one way or another.
