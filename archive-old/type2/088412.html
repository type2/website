Subject: Re: [T2] Question time


&gt; I am missing the brake shoe retaining clips in the rear drums on my '77 bus.
&gt; When I went to install new ones I found I have no hole in the backing plate
&gt; for them?? I thought all shoes had these clips, even the Bentley shows them.
&gt; Should I drill holes and install them?

No, you don't have them. VW stopped using them in the early/mid 70's. The
Bentley does not give an exact date.
Near as I can figure, the cut-off was 214 2057 729.
