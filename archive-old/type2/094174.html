&gt; The T4 spec as published is really too loose.  I

&gt; say to keep trying until you get the dwell on a T4 in the 49-51 range.

After my first tune-up (3,000 miles then sit for 4 years) which set the
dwell to 50 I thought the bus ran fine then I rechecked it the other day and
it was reading 52.  I found setting it to 47-48 makes you feel an equal on
the road although you have to lead foot it a bit still.

I thought it was just me. I tried taking the blades out of the holder, using
a wrong size to compensate. Pushing here, there. That darn thing.
