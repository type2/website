&gt; I am looking to buy a turnkey 1776cc for my bus.  COuld people please

&gt; any good quality low price engine rebuilders.  Thanks!

There's no such thing!  The parts for a quality rebuild cost more than
most of the low price rebuilders are charging, so they have to cut
corners, use &quot;marginal&quot; used parts, and generally produce a poor
quality product.

If you're serious about putting a 1776 into your bus, you really
_need_ to get a high-quality (and high-priced) rebuilt.  The
more-powerful engine will be stressed beyond the original design specs
of the stock 1600, and inattention to detail will yield a 5000-mile
engine.

IMO, your best bet is to check out the &quot;0-mile&quot; mexican engines being
offered.  $980 is a darn good price for a brand new engine, and
there's no worries about how good or bad the rebuilder is.

If you're driving with a tired 1600, just putting a fresh engine in
your bus will give you the desired performance increase, and you (and
your engine) will have less stress to worry about!
