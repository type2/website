Subject: SC/DC Dimensions

List -

I need to know what the dimensions of the bed of the SC &amp; DC's are, as well
as the dimensions of the rear &quot;wall&quot; (made by the cabin), and sides. Oh, and
roof lengths.

If you imagine needing the dimensions to mount a regular pick-up truck
camper on the back of a SC/DC, those are the ones I need.

Thanks -
