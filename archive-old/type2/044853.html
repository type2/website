Subject: [T2] No brake lights!

My brake light are not working on my 1977 bus. Here's what I've done; found
brake switch on brake Master cylinder, unhooked the wire harness from one
switch that has three prongs with ign on wired across, brake lights work? It
started to rain so haven't tried the other switch. I think this means the
switch is bad but I'm confused with the two switches? Does this mean both
are bad(seems unlikely) do both have to be good for the brake lights to
work? Also not sure what the other prong does on the switch? How hard is it
to bleed the brakes and any tips if I need to replace the switches.

Thanks,
 Ray
