Subject: Re: [T2] Barn Door swap

&gt; My neighbor is restoring  a 1971 Bus and wants to remove the slider and
&gt; replace it with a set of barn doors

The difficult part would be finding 2 1954 or older Buses to extract the
Barn Doors from.

It might be easier for your neighbor to fix his existing sliding door.
