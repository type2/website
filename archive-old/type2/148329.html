Subject: Re: [T2] engine decided to stop turning - WAS cannot get engine
  to crank fast enough

What I was alluding to in my previous post is that you can pinch a
bearing in assembly and that needs to be checked before you proceed
with assembly.

 have oil pressure. I am a bit stumped as to what to do next. I plan on
 taking the spark plugs out and trying to look down the holes to see if
 anything is in there. I am truly miffed. I am guessing I will have to
 pull the engine, tear it down, and try to find something wrong. I would
 guess a bearing would seize but it does not make sense considering it
 never got hot, the engine has yet to run. Any thoughts, whims, or ideas?
