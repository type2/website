Subject: Black rubber floor covering in along side of seats (Not floor mat)

Hi Folks,

Anybody know where I can find the black rubber floor covering material
that is on the seat supports.  It runs along by the sides of the seats
and around the front of them.

Mine is looking pretty shabby.  I have a 72 westfalia.

If anyone has ideas for a creative replacement I would be glad to give
it a try.

Thanks

Craig
