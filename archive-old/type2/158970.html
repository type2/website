Subject: New Bus!

After selling my 70 Westy named Armanda when I moved from Salt Lake to
Chicago 4 years ago, I have finally bought a new bus.  It's a 78 Riviera
that I intend to name &quot;Speedy Gonzales.&quot;

I saw a few recommendations online but I'm wondering if anyone in the
area has personal experience with mechanics that work on air-cooled
vw's.  I was starting to do a bit of work on my old vw - 4 years later,
I'm a little rusty and can definitely use some backup.

Also, I'm looking to get the bus painted sometime - does anybody have
experience with local body shops?

Thanks in advance!
