&gt; I have a 78 2.0 FI with automatic transmission and thinking of putting in a

it has been done but it is a MAJOR project requires welding and
fabrication.   gear shift linkages are different, auto has no clutch
tubing and the engine is sligtly different.  oh and the drive shafts are
different too.
