Subject: Help?  Need someone to look at a VW around  SE LA

What the title says, I need someone to have a look at a van around southeast LA.  Can't offer much for the favor, maybe some odd bay pieces here and there but I haven't moved most of them up here to AK yet, got a full syncro vanagon for parts except the running gear if you need anything shippable off it, or a case of beer if you prove to me you are legal for it.  I've seen a lot of detailed pics, just need somebody to have a physical look and drive.  It is a Vanagon actually but I don't follow on Vanagon anymore, so if anyone can do me the favor, I'd really, really, appreciate it.
   
  Thanks
  John
