Subject: Re: [T2] New starter on 78 Westfalia

IIRC, one spade connector is for the wire from the ignition, and the other
goes to the FI system to tell it that starting is being attempted. Both
wires connect to the same point, so go to a FLAPS or Radio Shack and get an
adapter with a single female and two male spades. Should run you about .19
cents.

) Do I have the right starter ? I ordered a new starter from one of our
favorite
    vendors and they sent me a brand new (not rebuilt) Bosch starter. On
    the order paperwork it says product number SR87X. On the actual Bosch
    Starter is says 9 000 042 035. The problem is I looked at my old starter
    and I have 2 seperate wires plugged into two spade connections on
    the starter selenoid. On the new stater there is only one spade
connector.

    I called the vendor today and they said this is the correct starter and
    that I may need to wire it differently !! ??
