Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel lines

&gt;My crystal ball is a little cloudy, so I going to
&gt;ASSUME you have 75 and later bus WITH fuel injection.
&gt;
&gt;If yes, that is the fuel pump.
&gt;

Im with you Karl,  sounds just like my install, and that would make
that canister the fuel pump.  the very fuel pump that wired backwards
to see if it would work.  and it does.  (that's my story, and im
sticking to it)..
