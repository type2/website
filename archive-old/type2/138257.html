Subject: Re: [T2] Windage tray

Hello Mark  These were on 914 motors to keep the oil from slooshing on hard 
cornering  I just finished putting 2 914 2.0Ls together that had these trays  
there are rubber seals on the edges that dont come with the gasket sets. Had to 
reuse these. They are held to the pickup tube by a 10mm headed bolt with a 
lock washer.  I havent ever seen one in a bus motor unless it was a 914 block.  
later and have fun  Mark Dearing
