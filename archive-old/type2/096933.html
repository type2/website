Ted,

What do all three motors have in common? For instance are you using 
the same carb and dizzy on each one? How about the manifold? Have you 
tried a different vac gauge? Where are you measuring the vac?

Most people will agree that 250F is too hot if not getting ugly. I 
would check for vac leaks at the carb to manifold connection, the 
boots, manifold to head connection. Also check any plugs you have in 
the carb vac ports and make sure they are not cracked and leaking. If 
you have a 009 stick it in just for kicks to eliminate the a vac leak 
in ignition system. Also check the brake booster setup and associated 
check valve in the engine room.

I am not sure what is wrong but if all three motors have the same 
issues they must have something in common and therein may lie the 
problem.

I REALLY hope you make it to HCBF as I have a check for you!
