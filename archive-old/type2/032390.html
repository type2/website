This is a parlor trick but I have often thought of trying it out on the connectors that  Steve is talking about. Get yourself a dingy old penny and a bottle of Tobasco Sauce(yum, I love that stuff.) Put a drop or two on the penny. Wipe it away and watch the shine. 

I am certain there is a basic chemical process going on here. Acids and bases or something of that nature. Is the oxidation on the brass connector the same as that on a common copper penny? Just curious. And lets not forget that Tobasco Sauce is bio-degradable.

Not Mr. Science

One of the constants of life on 20-50 year old cars is corrosion in the
push-on connectors, causing unreliable connections, especially in early
tail lamp assemblies.
