Subject: Re: [T2] Battery Terminal accessory tab

http://www.ratwell_dot_com/Misc/BatteryTab.html
The stock clamp Richard Atwell illustrates
Is very thin (small surface volume in terms of what is around the 
battery post) - I've seen them literally fall apart due to corrosion in 
the small surface area in the place where the push on tab is located.
Much better are the type (I sent Richard a pic) that use a large hole 
and side screw to insert the primary cable and secure it, with smaller 
holes and screws for extra wire runoffs.  Marine stores have them with 
corrosion proof gold plating.  On our Busses I use a cam action quick 
release clamp I originally bought in a K-Mart Auto section, Wal-Mart had 
them also.  Much easier to release, and the extra wire I used for the 
added power takeoffs is clamped in the same hole as the primary wire. 
Go look at how your house power distribution box- same kind of clamp!
