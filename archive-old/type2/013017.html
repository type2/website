&gt; Klaus, thank you for coming to my rescue, but the
&gt; crisis is over for the 
&gt; moment.
&gt; 
&gt; I had someone coming by on Monday to look at a car I
&gt; was trying to sell, and 
&gt; I needed to be assured that the VW would be ready to
&gt; drive.  Since I could 
&gt; not get the VW fixed, I had to take my other car off
&gt; the market and use it 
&gt; as a daily driver.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, there is a danger in using a '78 VW as a daily
&gt; driver, but I was hoping 
&gt; to get one other car on-line, to swap between the
&gt; '78 VW.  Not yet.
&gt; 
&gt; Only you and Bob 'access systems' offered to help
&gt; me, and Bob with an 
&gt; automatic starter.
&gt; 
&gt; So, one more time, I will try the butchered starter
&gt; I put together Sunday 
&gt; night and hope it works (it did bench test fine at
&gt; Trak Auto.)
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks again.

Hey Barry,
Briefly let me give you a few starter tips:
1.Tap on the starter w/hammer - frees it up if stuck
or if you have a worn out starter bushing, or if it
only clicks after an extended drive (sometimes the
starter gets as hot as the engine if you are slightly
overheating and the heat expands the starter
circuitry)
2. For the future, get a pushon male dual wire
attacher, and attach the two small wires on it from
the solenoid) leaving one of the male connectors open
on the solenoid, Attach a 12 - 14 gauge (VW red
w/white stripe type) wire to the open connector and
bring it through the rear engine sheet metal of a
sufficient length to reach the positive battery
terminal (you can just lay it on the sheet metal when
not in use since it w\is not a hot wire)leaving a
short portion of this end bare, so whenever you have
doubt about the starter just touch this end to the
positive battery terminal, and if you get nothing not
even a click, you only have two choices - replace
starter and bushing, or tap starter w/hammer and also
replace its bushing ASAP. 
Hope you understand this and GOOD LUCK, I believe in
the busses, but lil things when not properly addressed
can be quite aggravating, and oh yes this additional
wire is also quite handy when doing tuneups, valve
adjusts, etc.
