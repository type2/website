Subject: Marvel Mystery Oil (was oil additive advise)

I have used Marvel Mystery Oil (SP?) with good results
(quieting noisy hydrolic lifters) but I would like to
know what it does specifically and why many on the
list generally thinks its the only additive worth
anything.
Thanks,
Rick

&gt; &gt; Pretty sure Dupont went to court to have their
&gt; name removed from at
&gt; &gt; least one of the snake oil ads
&gt; 
&gt; The story I read said DuPont was asked by the snake
&gt; oil manufacturers to
&gt; sell them Teflon for use in the snake oil. DuPont
&gt; said no, Teflon doesn't
&gt; belong in motor oil, we don't want your product
&gt; damaging Teflon's good name,
&gt; no Teflon for you.
&gt; 
&gt; The snake oil manufacturers took DuPont to court.
&gt; DuPont lost--once you sell
&gt; a product, you can't tell people what to do with it.
