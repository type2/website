&gt; I don't know if that's because of actual QC

&gt; that new part is aftermarket.

It's because the only way to do the exhaust on a water-cooled Vanagon is to
replace all of it, not just the one part. If not replacing all the pipes, at
least they have to all be removed, then to install them, put them all back
at once, loosely, then tighten all at once slowly working around the system
several times tighten further until it is all fully tight. Same goes for a
75-78 system. Trying to surgically implant one of the components into the
system while it is all still together is a real headache.
