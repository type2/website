Subject: Re: [T2] points bounce?

[...]
i had to hit 6 grand on a type one engine to get point bounce.  It 
feels  just like you just hit the rev limiter (which  in a sense you 
have).  Pertronix and no bounce.  Of  course at 6  grand you can also 
get the other fun with valve springs.

&gt; It means that the point set spring is weak or you're revving very high.
&gt; Not something to worry about since your engine will blow before you get
&gt; point bounce with a Type IV engine.
