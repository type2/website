Oh yeah, and download the bosch FI test manual and go by those
instructions AFTER you've tested your ignition system per bentley.  You
might also have bad resistors, bad connections to/from the
computer/wiring harness, etc, or stuff like that.. but first check the
ignition and make sure you got a spark and that all the seals are nice
and neat and fuel's flowing well.  Then hit up the FI tests.  If you go
through all the ignition and FI tests, you'll learn alot and have a nice
running engine...

&gt; -Check all of your spark plug wires (try swapping or buy new ones if

&gt; -Get new plugs (couldn't hurt)
&gt; -change out the injector seals
&gt; -test the injectors (good thing to do while changing seals)
&gt; -UNLESS YOU HAVE NEW FUEL LINES, CHANGE YOUR FUEL LINES NOW!  It's cheap
&gt; insurance and it's much easier when you have the injectors out!
&gt; -Heed all safety warnings when playing with fuel :)
&gt; -Check your valve clearances
&gt; -Try swapping injector connectors - don't worry about mixing them up,
&gt; they all fire at the same time
&gt; -Make sure the spark plug wires coming off the distributor cap are going
&gt; to the correct cylinders
&gt; -Check the distributor cap to see if there's major buildup
&gt; -Do a compression test on all the cylinders
&gt; -Check your fuel pressure
&gt; 
&gt; umm.. can't think of anything else.. but I'm sure someone else can :)

&gt; &gt; hi everyone
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I drove my bus for the first time tonite, from my vw mechanic's shop
&gt; &gt; home... about 5 miles. I was excited and nervous at the same time to
&gt; &gt; finally be able to drive her. All went well. For a bus that sat for 4
&gt; &gt; years with no engine, she rode extreamly smooth. I guess this would be her
&gt; &gt; first trip report :)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I posted the otherday about my vw guy telling me that the engine was only
&gt; &gt; running on 2 cylinders. When I went to his shop this morning he showed me
&gt; &gt; what exactly he was talking about. He took some starting fluid and sprayed
&gt; &gt; it on different parts of the engine. When he sprayed it on the left side
&gt; &gt; intake runner it reved up really nice then died back to a slower idle a
&gt; &gt; few seconds later. When he sprayed it to where intake runners connect to
&gt; &gt; the central air induction unit it did the same. Spraying to the right side
&gt; &gt; intake runners did nothing. So, I guess this would mean there is a leak on
&gt; &gt; the left side #3 and #4. When he pulled the plug wires on those cylinders
&gt; &gt; there was no change in the idle. So sure enough shes only running on 2
&gt; &gt; cyls....
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; When I put the engine in i replaced the old intake runners with ones off a
&gt; &gt; porsche 914. the old ones were rusted pretty bad. My vw guy said that
&gt; &gt; sometimes they warp, letting air get it and do exactly this. I put on new
&gt; &gt; manifold to head gaskets on and new runner boots as well. He said it could
&gt; &gt; also be the injector seals. He gave me a new set to put on as well as a
&gt; &gt; new intake runner for that side. He woudl have done it, but I had just
&gt; &gt; paid $625 for an entire brake job so,being a bit short on $$ I'll have to
&gt; &gt; deal with this one on my own ;)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My questions:
&gt; &gt; this is my intended plan of attack. I'm gonna clean up that new intake
&gt; &gt; runner, get it good and clean/smooth as well as the mating face on the
&gt; &gt; head. install the new intake runner (should I use any sealant? didn't
&gt; &gt; before and the job failed....) I also plan to clamp the boots on. I figure
&gt; &gt; it couldn't hurt any.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; A question:
&gt; &gt; when he did the brakes he said he couldn't get the brake pedal from
&gt; &gt; dropping with the speed of the engine. When you rev it faster, the pedal
&gt; &gt; falls with the engine speed. He said it was probably the same leak
&gt; &gt; problem. He tried 4 booster valves and the all did the same thing. He put
&gt; &gt; it on backwards to override the power assist for the time being. Just so I
&gt; &gt; could get it home :)
&gt; &gt; Could it be related, or is that something else... like the servo?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Comment:
&gt; &gt; I can't beleive this thing is only running on 2 cyls.. I mean, i saw with
&gt; &gt; my own eyes that when he pulled the wires it had no effect, and this is
&gt; &gt; bad. BUT I GOT THE THING UP TO 40MPH ON THE WAY HOME THAT WAY!!! is that
&gt; &gt; possible? It was weak... but I would not expect a 4 cyl engine to run that
&gt; &gt; good on only 2 cyls. Maybe it just does. That would also be a good
&gt; &gt; explination as to why it smells so bad.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Could a false or incorrect vaccum line connection cause any of the above
&gt; &gt; symptoms? If anyone has any advise or corrections to what I have stated it
&gt; &gt; would be very much appreciated..
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; thank you all so very much for reading
