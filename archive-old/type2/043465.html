I have noticed that the use of heavy duty gas shocks is one of those 
sometimes controversial topics that seems to split the ACVW community into 
distinct camps.  They are NOT universally accepted as the best shock for your 
type I or 2.

I do not routinely push the load/weight bearing capacity of my bus or ghia to 
its upper limits.  As a result, I am unwilling to sacrifice my ride quality 
and the extra $$.  If I hauled bricks for a living or raced bajas 
professionally I might feel differently.
