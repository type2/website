&gt; What kinds of things Bob? I similarly have chronic pinging on my 72 I
&gt; can't locate. Heads run cool. Beautiful golden brown plugs. Tried
&gt; retarding and advancing timing. Can't get it to go away. Heads were
&gt; clean when I pulled them.

have to remember the Octanes used at the pumps have gone down since our
buses were built, in the 70's regular was 89-91 octane. now it is 87, my
78 needs at least mid grade to run right, so I bite the bullet and pump 89
octane in it.  in your case it sounds like your bus is just begging for a
little more octane...
