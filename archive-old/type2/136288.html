Subject: Re: [T2] Wandering

&gt; My 68 Westy seems to want to wander all over the highway without my
&gt; permission.  It also lets out a squeak ever time it hits a bump.  After
&gt; over thirty years I suppose there could be some wear in the front end,
&gt; the question is, where.   Greg in so. ca.

get a helper to move the steering wheel back and forth.
crawl under the front and look. you should be able to see where the
movement is.
ie....
steering box, tie rod ends, drag link, ball joints, center pin pivot.
youll see it.
