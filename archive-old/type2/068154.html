Subject: Need help adjusting dual carbs on an 1800cc

Hi Volks,
        I'm trying to get my '74 Sportsmobile all adjusted for one final
trip before the winter storage begins, and am having some trouble.  It seems
that I have three different mixture adjustment screws, one on top of the
left carb, just left of the idle adjustment screw, one midway down on the
left side of the left carb, and one midway down on the right side of the
right carb.  I have Muir and Haynes to go by, but neither mentions the
proper adjustment for all three.  One said to adjust both of the side
mixture screws all the way in, and then back them each out 2 1/2 turns,
etc..., but never mentioned the third screw up by the idle screw.  I can't
afford a $299 UniSyn, so I'm just leaving the linkage alone, but would like
to take my best shot at getting the mixture right.  Any suggestions on how
to get all three screws in their proper positions?

        Also one more problem, carb related.  When cold, the engine idles
nice and fast and smoothly, but after its warmed up, and I kick down the
choke, it idles too slowly and backfires (popcorn sound) alot.  I have
repeatedly set the idle to 900rpm, at operating temp, but it keeps returning
to the slow idle.  Is it possible that when my mixture is set correctly this
will straighten itself out, or is there something else amiss?

                                        Thanks in advance,
                                                               -- Eric
