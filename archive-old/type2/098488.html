Drew,

It is certainly posible, but it is also possible (and much cheaper :-)
that you ran your battery down.  Do try to spin the motor with the
screwdriver across the two big terminals as Rick described.  If it spins,
then your motor is good.  From the clicking, we already know the solenoid
is good.  The only two things left are (a) the battery is dead/dying and
needs a charge or (b) the contacts in the starter motor are fried.  (b) is
possible, but it 95/5 that the battery is a bit flat.
