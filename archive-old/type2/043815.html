&gt;Hello:
&gt;
&gt;I have a 71 bus.  The clutch is slipping.  Mechanic says the case is
&gt;cracked.  I will see for myself tomorrow.  I believe case may be cracked as
&gt;oil leak is excessive and two #1 spark plugs have blown out in 8 months.
&gt;
&gt;Friends and this site do not recommend said mechanic.  Where can I go
&gt;between San Jose and Menlo Park to get quality work?  I live in Sunnyvale.
&gt;Also, any thoughts on rebuilt vs. new engine and the pricing below?
&gt;
&gt;Cost for rebuilt is $2350, 10 day turn around, 18 month warranty
&gt;Cost for new is $2500, 5 day turn around, 12 month warranty
&gt;
&gt;Please use chris_melcer_at_yahoo_dot_com
&gt;
&gt;Muchas Gracias.
&gt;
&gt;Chris
