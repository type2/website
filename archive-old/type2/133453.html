&gt; My automatic 73 bus has bounced around mechanics for two years.
&gt; I've read about 200 threads on this great site regarding this

bummer part is a real trick to find and it is different early/late auto
tranny

&gt; My first mechanic told me I would NOT be able to put in another

did he say why.??

&gt; problem can be fixed, or even if I will be able to put in another
&gt; late model tranny?????? I don't want to convert to a manual, but I
&gt; want to get my bus running again! I miss it!

stick in a late model tranny BUT you will still need to find that part. in
fact if you find the bus with the tranny get the ENTIRE shift mechanism
because the shifter in the front is different too, it should bolt right up
but it is different.  other than that and the cable in the rear going in
the other side, and maybe the accelerator linkage (which you should get
from the donor bus too) it should fit just fine.  might want to grab the
firewall tin don't think you'll need it but never can tell the accelerator
linkage hole may not line up.

&gt; ANy advice on what my mechanic and I should consider?

get a new mechanic?!?!
