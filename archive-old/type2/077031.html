That's cause it would be a right proper bastard to install. Does it have
all the parts to put it in?  The price for the fuel pump tells it all.
Every single part on that engine might as well be made of gold. The last
one I had needed a distributor, and I had a choice of $600 + for a new one
or reworking a different model for about $500. Lots of power, but what a
pain in the butt.
