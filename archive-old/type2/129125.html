Subject: Re: [T2] Rebuild steering box?

&gt; Is it possible to rebuild a steering box? I have an original 72 steering 
&gt; box out of my van, which needs to be replaced. Can it be rebuilt?

Yes.

According to the Bentley manual, this can be done on steering boxes from 
68-72. The procedure involves disassembly/cleaning/ and reshimming some 
  gears. And finally, to measure resistance as you reassemble. The 
amount of resistance they want to you measure is in inch pounds, so 
you'll need to devise a system to measure inch pounds of torque. Torque 
wrenches in this range run around $300 when I checked. I have no idea 
where you might find the shims, but it looks like you might be able to 
have a good machinist turn them out easily. Check out the Bentley manual 
(you do have one, don't you?!?)
