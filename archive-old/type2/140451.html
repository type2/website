Subject: Re: [T2] Workin' on the bus

    Sorry to say I don't think the Harbor Freight vacuum  pump will help
you. It is &quot;driven&quot; by compressed air, and takes a large volume of air at
that! If you read the description it has &quot;no moving parts&quot;. I have one and
it works by way of air moving across a venturi causing a vacuum. Not to
mention it makes a very loud hissing noise!
    How about a Rabbit or other VW Diesel vacuum pump? They are driven by
the intermediate shaft in the block. So it would take some &quot;red neck&quot;
rigging, mount, drive, etc. But there plentiful and cheap, and make the
right amount/volume of vacuum for power brakes as that is there main
function on a Rabbit.

&gt; Thought I saw on of these in the harbor freight catalog yesterday.
&gt;
&gt; Sure enough!
