Subject: Re: [T2] 1800 TypeIV w/dual solex carbs for sale 


&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; I have an 1800 TypeIV engine with dual solex carbs for sale.  It was running
&gt; when I pulled it about a year ago.  I pulled it to install an engine I had
&gt; done a top-end rebuild.  I have three complete motors, and do not need them
&gt; all so this one is up for grabs.  It has been stored outside wrapped in a
&gt; tarp.  I need the space it is currently occupying, so the sooner the
&gt; better.  
&gt; 
&gt; I won't ship the whole engine, so it'll have to go to someone local who is
&gt; willing to stop by and get it.  I am in Portland, Oregon.
&gt; 
&gt; $75 OBO

I'll take it for that much. I need a rebuild engine.
