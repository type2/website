Subject: Re: [T2] double relay question

Greg:

I didn't pull out my manual to read the testing process for the double relay
so I can't really comment on the results of your tests.  However, my
instinct is that a starting problem such as you describe is more likely to
be related to FI issues, e.g., thermo-time switch/cold start valve system
not working, fuel pressure problems or TempII sensor issues, rather than an
&quot;electrical&quot; problem.  I've had double relays fail and, in my experience,
when they fail, they fail at all temperatures.  Besides, you obviously *do*
get the engine started, eventually, when the engine is cold, otherwise you
wouldn't know it starts OK when warm :-).  Have you eliminated all the more
&quot;obvious&quot; issues?

Subject: [T2] double relay question


&gt; Hi Volks!  I've suffered with hard cold starting of my recently rebuilt
&gt; 2.0L GE (it starts perfectly when warm)  and I proceeded to do some tests
&gt; according to Bentley.
&gt;
&gt; In testing the double relay,  I only made it through the first 2 tests.
It
&gt; says put one end of a test lite to terminal 85 and one end to 88y and then
&gt; 88z.  When I put one end to 88y and 88z, the light did in fact come on,
but
&gt; the relay clicked as if it was the test light that actually made the
&gt; connection both times.  It did this on both 88y and 88z.  Is this
&gt; normal?  also, when I checked 86c, the relay only buzzed a while, then
&gt; eventually clicked and the test light came on.  I suspect a possible bad
&gt; relay.  Am I heading in the right direction?  tx, Greg
