Subject: RE: [T2] Heat

&gt; Heater core?  ;-).  Seriously, I'll have to demonstrate my
&gt; BA6 heater to you someday - I had the snow melting off my
&gt; windshield in a couple of minutes yesterday.


I'll second that.  Putting a BA6 (from a junkyard donor) in my '77 Westy was
the best upgrade I ever made to my Bus.  Fifteen degrees out - no problem!
The traditional &quot;watercooled&quot; heater in my Vanagon can't begin to compete -
instant heat, and with a timer function for camping to boot!  If you ever
stumble on one, grab it. (But make sure to get all the ancilliary parts,
plan on a plenty of testing/assembly, and hope all the components are good,
because new replacement parts are either unavailable or priced like gold.)
You can also use a BA4 out of a VW 411/412; same design but a smaller
furnace (and no auxilliary blower fan) so less effective in the larger Bus
interior. Good for parts, though, as all BA4 parts (besides the furnace
itself) interchange with BA6 parts.
