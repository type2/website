Subject: Re: [VB] BEWARE south austin machine and parts!!

was writ

&gt; while putting the timing gears on my crank the other day, i was
&gt; unable to get the cam gear all the way snugged before it cooled down
&gt; enough to seize.

there's two tools that belong in every garage for the hobbyist who works on
older cars- impact driver and a press. Neither one costs very much and after
you've had one at your disposal you'll wonder how you did without. Presses
aren't very expensive for a 10 or 20 ton, usually less than $100 bucks. I've
got 2, a 12 ton and a little hand one for small parts. Had the same problem
as Craig the other day, two cranks, one with a bodged dist gear and good
crank, the other the reverse. Threw them on the press, time to change gears,
less than the time it took to get a cup of coffee. Same old lesson, save the
time you loose trying to wing it and money on parts you break and invest
them in good tools. Geez, now I sound like my dad.
