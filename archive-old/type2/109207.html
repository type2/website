Happy Weekend, and an extra hello to anyone out there who is a father or has
one......

I have read all the horror stories about cops and busses so I thought I'd put
in a plug for the other side of the coin. At lunchtime today I was driving my
74 Riviera to the bank when I passed a Kentucky State Police cruiser that was
waiting to turn onto the highway. The trooper on the passenger side flashed me
a peace sign and the one driving waved! Rack up one for the good guys.

Regards,
Dave
74 Riviera Weekender, Rivka
