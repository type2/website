&gt;&gt; Thank you for your enlightened counsel, based on two weeks' 
&gt;&gt; acquaintance with the list. Tell you what. I'm unsubscribing. I will 
&gt;&gt; spare your zapping finger. I asked a question, and I got a response.

Mark.

What a baby you are.  &quot;Fine, you criticize me, I'm going home!  I'm 
unsubscribing!  Everybody please tell me how much you love me!&quot;

You DO need to chill out.  I've thought that for years.  Kept it to 
myself, though.

So now you know.  I don't love you.  I do respect you.  Let's get back 
to talking about vans.

Stephen,
'78 Westy
