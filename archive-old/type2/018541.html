For some unknown reason I have the dizzy from an auto-trans bus in my
*MANUAL SHIFT* 74 1800. The part # is 022 905 205S. At least I now know
what the proper timing spec at idle is...I think.

I gather that the advance/retard curve is narrower for this dizzy than
for the 205N. Frankly I'd prefer the OE part but I'm quickly running
through my spare change and most likely need a new muffler, some exhaust
manifold gaskets and on and on.._dot_can I live with the 205S for a while or
will it give me more grief than I need?
