Subject: using teflon tape.....
Message-ID: &lt;7a30d8de.245eee2d_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

i have read many mails lately about putting in aftermarket oil press. 
senders, etc.  quite a few are recommending using teflon tape.  this is fine 
but a word of caution.....BE CAREFUL.  the teflon tape will give a very 
inaccurate torque feel and will cause you to overtighten and strip the 
threads.  i recommend using some *pipe dope* all plumbers use it.  spread a 
little bit on the threads and snug the npt fitting down normally.  this 
reduces the risk of stripping and provides a bit of sealant.  to those who 
are determined to use teflon, on a piece of npt that small do not over-wrap 
the pipe.  one or one-half times around the threads is plenty.  fwiw...imho.
