I too am looking to do soundproofing after being inspired  by Bulley's
site but also have Scottish blood in me.

Would getting a flat, shallow metal tray, lining it with aluminium foil
(a bit thicker than cooking foil), laying some old canvas or denim on
the foil and impregnating it with asphalt emulsion produce a similar, if
not necessarily perfect, result?  I haven't handled asphalt emulsion so
I'm not sure if this would work or could be made to work.
