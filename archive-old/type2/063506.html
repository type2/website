&gt; Howdy,

&gt; Thanks to a yet-unamed party, my web site now sports early bus
&gt; wiring diagrams.

OK, Thom, I'll step forward and take credit for the scams, er,
uh, scans.

&gt; A couple of them are not really great scans, but most of them
&gt; are very nice.  The only problem is I do not yet know which
&gt; diagram is for which year!  D'oh!

I will not, however, take credit for the quality.  That's what
you get when you go to scans'R'us.  Sheesh, I thought you'd just
*know* which are which! ;)  Patience, patience.  I've got NEATO
want ads to type, more Registry forms to enter and another Typing
2 Ink column to write...not to mention a rubber analysis to
perform.  None of that is getting my '67 Deluxe back on the road
after the engine blew.  Oh, and I *do* have a job.

&gt; Anyway, they are available at www_dot_calweb_dot_com/~thom/techinfo.html

It's all good stuff to look at and thanks to Thom for adding it
to his website.

&gt; I know they only go back to '62; I'm still looking for earlier ones.

Can't help you there, but I will get with Thom offlist to see if
we can arrange for new scans and identification of the diagrams
for those who can't just tell the year by looking at the diagram.
