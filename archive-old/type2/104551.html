Subject: Re: [T2] NEW TO THE LIST!

Todd, good to have you on the list.

First things first, you started off great, but went down hill after that, be
sure to refer to your new to you type 2 as a BUS.  And yes, if you don't
treat it or call it correctly, your bus will make you pay for it!!

Don't remove the heads, shoot a couple good squirts of transmission oil down
the spark plug holes and wait a couple days before you try to turn the
engine over if you are worried about seized rings.

 
&gt; I'm just about to take ownership of a 1973 Volkswagen Bus.

&gt; I decided to buy her this 1973 Volkswagen Van.
 
&gt; In any case... this is the current condition of the car:
