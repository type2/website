I first noticed my fuel pump dying on me when i was building speed in my 72
westy /w 1700 pancake, twin weber carbs, i was going about 70 for 2 big steep
hills, normally it would chug its way up in 4th gear, but all power was lost,
i downshifted, same problem, then it would start bucking since it wanted to
stall, the only reason it was still running was gravity feed, anyway, that
might be your problem , then again i am an idiot.

&lt;&lt; Should I be worried about the following.....
 	I was cruising along doing 55mph when I started to climb a long hill.
 	As the car slowed, I applied more pressure to the accelerator, but power
 just seemed to fall away. I geared down into 3rd to pick it up again, but it
 just kept dropping away even though I had my foot flat out on the pedal.
 	I pulled off, kept her running, and went back to listen to the engine...all
 sounded fine. I limped back onto the motorway, thinking of all the possible
 problems, when....as suddenly as it had happened, it went away, and I
 climbed back up to the 50's.....now I can't stop worrying about it.
 	Is it a clutch thing, or was I just putting to much on the gas ??
 ...any thoughts/help would be appreciated.
