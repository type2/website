Subject: Re: [T2] 2002 Canadian Shows?

Hi Craig.

3 Canadian Bus events not to be missed, in chronological order:

1. Busfusion - www.busfusion_dot_com
Almonte Ontario, near Ottawa. June 19- 22,nd
See the web page for more info.

2. Buses By the Falls - (no date yet), Niagara Falls, Ontario. July???
This campout is in conjunction with the June Jitterbug VW Show in Niagara
Falls. Contact Jamie Rivers for more info.

3. Buses of the Corn - Whitby Ontario, August ????
This campout is in conjunction with the Great Canadian Bug Show in
Stouffville.  When I know the date of the bug show I will firm up the
planning for this event and let the list know. Last year I had 15 buses show
up on word-of-mouth only, this year will be a lot bigger.

There are probably more, but these are my favourites.

Happy trails,

&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt; 
&gt; I am starting to plan this summer's weekend get aways.  To the delight
&gt; of my wife, I usually plan our trips with the 72 Westy around a couple
&gt; of VW shows.  Seriously she is very supportive of my addiction and
&gt; enjoys the shows almost as much as I do.
&gt; 
&gt; That being said, anyone know of a site with a list of all the 2002
&gt; Canadian shows or for that matter shows within a 4-6 ride at 50-55 from
&gt; Ottawa, Ontario?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
