Subject: GOT MY BUS STARTED!!!

Ok, awesome! I got my bus started!

The only problem is that there is this really annoying TAP. It sounds like a
bad lifter and I cannot for the life of me get rid of it. I seem to remember
having this problem with my Bus before I started to rebuild it. It has
hydraulic lifters and I seem to remember that after a LONG time, the tapping
would eventually go away as that lifter eventually built up pressure.

I can't imagine that having the bus run like that for 10 minutes with tapping
on the cam is good for it. What can I do to stop that? Does something need to
be adjusted? What can I do to make it stop?

I'm going to take it for a quick run and see if I can get it to stop with it
under load.


Todd
