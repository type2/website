Been there.  Take it off and then remove the bracket where usually the
bumper bends on its edge.  With a few friends standing along the good
side, get a large SLEDGE and beat downwards to flatten the bumper to
nearly original profile.  I've done it, but you tend to flatten the
center ridge.

 The bumper's bent back into the body on that side.  I was thinking
about
 hooking a chain to the bumper and pulling the bumper back out to
 approximately the right position.  Is this stupid, desperate, or simply
 field expedient &quot;okay&quot;?
