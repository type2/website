Subject: disk brake protocol; cv off hub idea

Re knocking out cv axle with no vise- get some 6X6 hunks or even cap blocks
and stack them in 2 piles.  Do this on a concrete floor.  Make like a roman
arch and start on the sides of the lower cv and bring them in towards the
axle.  The 2 piles should lift the lower cv up about an inch.  You might
even get 2 wheel rims stacked and push the upper cv thru the hole and find
something to lay under the cv on each side, such as 2 pieces of flat bar
stock 1/4&quot; thick.  Now get out you super punch   or 1/2&quot; socket extension
and tap the center of the hub, driving it down.  The idea is to put force
evenly on opposite sides of the axle.
   If the bus has that low milage, rotors should be ok- I've put 193K on
mine and never had them turned or rebuilt- on my 71 I went 220K and same
thing.  I just now replaced my pads; the old ones had about 1-2mm left on
all 4 pads.  I rotate the disks against a file to knock off rust scale on
outside edges and inside by hub.  Any uneveness is quickly worn into the
pads.  Any surface rust just sand lightly with black cloth sandpaper.  The
inside edge by hub is a little fatter and quickly wears its groove into the
edge of the pad.
   When I remove my pads, I take out the brake fluid in the resoivor and
then slip a putty knife bettween a pad and the rotor. In this gap I tap a
hardwood wooden wedge I cut from 1.5&quot; lumber (P.T. is yellow pine and hard
enough; so is hem-fir).  The old pad is left against the piston to spread
the force and protect the rubber.  Once you have about 3/8&quot; gap or so, blow
out all rust , remove the pad and metal shim with the tabs and take a SMALL
crowbar (they are about 7&quot; long with a bent end) and ease it into the
hollow opening of the caliper piston- now you can wedge it against the
rotor and push or tap it to make the piston seat all the way in.  I add a
fatter wedge to the  done side while tapping the wedge into the other side.
 The pads should slide in easy; file the bottom and top of the pad seat and
if it is still tight, I grind the new pad mdetal edges just enough so it
will slide in.   Use the pads with the slot in the middle. Place thse shim
metal pieces so the tabs sit behind the cutout in the piston, them slide in
the new pad as you hold a nail or icepick in the locking pin holes to keep
the shim from getting pulled in too far.
   A comment on hammering your triple square into the cv's on the car- this
may not be good for the bearings behind the CV's!
