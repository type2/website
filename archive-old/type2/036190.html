I find my bus exceedingly comfortable for long trips... the only drawback
being lack of heat in the winter. If your bus isnt comfortable enough,
perhaps it is broken in some way?  But saying we all find our busses
uncomfortable for long trips is downright wrong. ( ihave driven over 50k
miles in the last 2-3 years in my 71 and found it quite pleasant 90% of
the time)

hope you get your problem fixed...

peas,

Steve
