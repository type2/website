Actually, I was thinking about the potential of drawing fumes in through holes
in the heat exchangers' tin work.

I read some where that there are vents (holes) in the tin work to help keep the
heat exchangers from over heating when the cabin heating system is closed.

This is referring to Type 1 engines.  I take this with a grain of salt.

: A very interesting point, however I believe it has a fatal flaw.  There is
: much greater positive pressure generated in the exhaust system than the
: vacuum (HE -&gt; Blow -&gt; Cabin), or the pressure (blow -&gt; HE -&gt; cabin)
: generated by any of these fans, so I believe that in either case exhaust
: gas that can enter the 'fresh air' system will do so.  Maybe there is some
: truth to the argument you present, but I would guess it accounts for a
: single digit percentage change when the engine is running at speed.
