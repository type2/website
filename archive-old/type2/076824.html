&gt; Does this mean that if you have an engine case that was used for a
&gt; single port or dual carb configuration and you want to go dual port,
&gt; you may have to change the stud to a longer stud in order to secure
&gt; the center manifold piece if the case was not built for dual port?

Yes.  In fact, if you get a new Mexican engine, you have to install this
long stud as they are set up for fuel injection.
