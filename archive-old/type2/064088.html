I've heard this story before and don't think it's correct. Here in South
Africa at least we did have the separate chrome bezel on the Euro-style
taillights. I believe the &quot;built-in&quot; chrome surround was only introduced
some time later, most likely when the chrome bezel was dropped from the
parts list. I have seen old Euro-style taillight lenses without the
&quot;built-in&quot; chrome surround, suggesting they were from the days when the
chrome bezel was still available. The &quot;built-in&quot; chrome surround lenses are
still available quite cheaply from VW dealers here. I may be wrong, but I
think that's the story behind the &quot;built-in&quot; chrome surround.
