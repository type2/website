Subject: 1975 FI and newer fuelpump for sale.

Hello,
 I an attempt to simplify my 75s motor i have simply decided to remove the
FI all together. As far as I know the only thing missing is the decel valve.
Sometimes I would have to squirt a shot of either in the intake to get it to
start but it would run fine after that. It would idle high on account of the
missing decel valve(Thats what im told.)
The wiring is in pretty good shape.
I have a brand new fuel pump with a few miles on it. It is on the van now
and the only use it has seen is driving around my yard and up the road
several times.  It is a  remanufactured fuel pump from the Python injection
company. cost $189 .

I didnt want to put this stuff on Ebay cause i think that it should be
offered to the list first.
 I m not real sure what to ask for the injection stuff (minus the fuel
pump)but i thought i would ask:
-FI, computer, wiring and all parts minus Decel valve and fuel pump.
  $50 or offers
- Remanufactured fuel pump, $100 (cost $189)

the whole thing for $150??

Thanks,
 Bryan
