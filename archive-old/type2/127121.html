Subject: Shift Rod Bushings

&gt;&gt;And, unless Busdepot has changed vendors(I think these only come from one
place now), you are going to have to modify the holes in your shifter in
order to get them to stay in...they need to be a little larger than they
are now.

I found that out this morning. The one new one I have needed some shaving
down with a knife. I've placed the order for the remaining two and will
start cleaning out and lubing the tube. Before I pulled the engine I had
lost 3rd and 4th gear but I was able to move the selector shaft on the
tranny when it was out so I sense the problem was in the linkage. So I'm
replacing every bushing and cleaning everything while she's down.
