Subject: Re: [T2] head temperature sensor

Hi Matt,

When the ignition is in the start position the fuel pump runs off the 
ignition switch. As the air vane in the air mass sensor moves off its stop 
it closes a switch that holds the pump on when the starter is deenergized. 
The idea is that in case of an wreck the engine will die and stop the fuel 
pump.

Also the cold start valve gives a shot of gas for a few seconds.

I think that with the ignition on you should be able to move the vane 
(remove the air filter to gain access) off its stop and listen for the pump.

It seems the injectors are working (engine runs with the heat sensor 
disconnected) but just to be sure disconnect all four electrical connectors 
(they pop off pretty easy) from the injectors and see if it acts the same 
way (starts and runs for 30 sec).

I am assuming you don't have a pressure gauge. I think I mentioned a 
measurement point on the fuel ring manifold.

Maybe the ECU has a triggering problem in cold weather. The trigger is 
developed across the ignition condenser. I have been told that the trigger 
is higher than 12V (peaking effect from the coil). CDI systems don't trigger 
the VW ECU without a peaking coil addition. Anyway no trigger no injector 
pulse. If you miss triggers you run lean or stop.
The disconnected sensor might make up for some missing triggers.

Hope this helps.

Chuck

&gt;HI Chuck,
&gt;
&gt;How is everything? I got a chance to change my fuel filter today and
&gt;unfortunately I am still experiencing the same problem.
&gt;My bus starts, runs, and then dies about 30 seconds after. I can 
&gt;immediately
&gt;restart and the same is repeated.
&gt;I have a fresh air filter, fuel filter, head temperature sensor, and plugs.
&gt;I am also pretty sure there are no vacuum leaks.
&gt;
&gt;When I took off the old fuel filter there was some rust and dirt in the
&gt;filter. Nothing too extreme though.  I was hoping that the new filter would
&gt;make a difference. It did not.
&gt;
&gt;I am at a loss here. I seriously thought the problem would be solved. After
&gt;I started the van and let it die I checked my spark plugs. They were bone
&gt;dry. It's obvious that there is no fuel reaching the engine when it dies.
&gt;Any other suggestions?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;
&gt;Matt
&gt;
