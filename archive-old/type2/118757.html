Subject: RE: [T2] Distributer, schematic request (long)

I wanted to thank everyone who replied to my email last week on my
distributer issue.  You were all very helpful and concise in your
information.

It's good to get some additional knowledge of places that I can go
to in the Portland area to get things like distributers worked on.
So many good resources in Portland, but unless you know where they
are, you will never find them.

So even though (with this particular bus) I will be replacing my
vacuum distributer with an electronic unit I wanted to make sure
that I gave a special thanks to Rik, Jason C., David Mueller, Karl
von Salzen(of course) and Bob in Leucadia for their helpful and
timely replies.  People like you are the reason that I am on this
list.  Good folks with their hearts in the right places.  Thanks
again,

Seann Stafford
