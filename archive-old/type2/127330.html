Subject: Re: [T2] first start up of used engine and how to clean out?

Hi Snoopy, I'm back from BB&amp;B, what a blast.. The best
thing to do with one that is cruded up like that is to
leave it alone, and hope it stays put on the bottom of
the engine. Try the rinsing with the mystery oil might
help??? The correct thing to do would be to overhaul
the engine that way all the crud gets removed and you
get to start all over with a nice engine..(Hehehehe)
Phil
