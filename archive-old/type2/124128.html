Subject: H20 Restore

I'm in the process of restoring the water system in my 76 Westy.  I'm trying
to figure out the right type of sealant to use on the tank for the filler neck
and the two connections at the bottom for the pump and drain.  When I ask the
guys at the plumbing store what would be suitable for use on plastic, for
drinking water, that will not create a permanent seal they look at me like I'm
crazy and say there is no such thing.  Any ideas?
Thanks,
Mike
