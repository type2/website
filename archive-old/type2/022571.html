&lt;&lt; This is a brand new distributor, what should I be looking at? &gt;&gt;

Bob,

If you just installed a new dist. and everything else is setup and tuned 
correctly, it sounds like the vacuum and/or centrifugal advance mechanism on 
the dist. is not doing its job.  Did you get the vacuum lines hooked up 
correctly?  Are the hoses good?  If you suck on the hose, can you see the 
plate that the points are mounted on move?  Did you check your advance with a 
timing light to see if you a get a quick &quot;hit&quot; of advance from the vacuum 
canister when you bump the throttle?  Did you have your total advance checked 
at about 3400rpm?  If so, what was it?

What year is your bus?
What engine do you have in it?
What is the VW/Bosch part # on the dist?

With this information, someone should be able to help out.
