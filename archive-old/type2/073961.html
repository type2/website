Subject: drilled bumpers/aux lights

A few years ago, I bought a couple Cibie Oscar + driving lights for my bus.
I hadn't ever taken the time to install them until a few weeks ago.  I
mentioned to a friend with a '77 bus that I was going to drill the front
bumper and install them when he mentioned that he already had some holes on
the bottom of his front bumper.  I checked and I had some holes on the
bottom of mine also.  When I checked closer, they were located exactly where
I wanted to mount the Oscars.

So I took off the front bumper and turned it over.  As it had four holes,
and I had also picked up a pair of Cibie Iode 40s, I decided to install them
all, a la Unca Joel.  Relatively easy installation, with the Oscars between
the nose-mounted spare and the regular headlights, and the Iode 40s sitting
outside of the regular headlights.  Everything lights up really nicely.

I checked on my friend's bus and it's a '77 window bus.  The front bumper
has 3 holes on the bottom of each side for a total of 6.  Mine is a '73
Westfalia (Kombi) and had 2 on each side for a total of 4.

Did we just happen to get buses with holes drilled in them or do they all
have holes drilled on the bottom of the newer (post '73) style breadloaf
bumpers?

Thanks,
Dean
