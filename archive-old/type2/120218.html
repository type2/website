Subject: dual carb twist linkage

Okay, so I hate my tyco linkage on my 2.0 with dual dells.  I was thinking about going to a twist linkage.  I have seen the set up at some shows before and it seems to be simpler and a linkage that will stay in sink. Don't some type 4's use a twist linkage?
 
Any thoughts from the All-Mighty board?
 
Paul
