Subject: New wood paneling?

 Hello all!

 Getting close to the time when Im going to have to reinstall the interior
 in my 70 westy.  I went to the local lumber yards looking for the thin birch
 paneling for the sides and the ceiling panels.  They didnt have anything 
 that came close to the thickness I need.  The closest they had was twice as
 thick as I need and that stuff will never bend, yet alone fit into the 
 channels.  Am I looking at the right places?  Mabee I dont know what it 
 Im looking for.

 Any help is alway appreciated!
