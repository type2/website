Subject: A Proposal &quot;Top of the World 2000&quot;

(I'm sending this yet again as I'm not sure it ever made it though,
with the list turmoil and all as my SMTP is still returning it even
though I can now post to the list.)

As spring rolls around this year and the Westfalias come out of 
hibernation all across the more frigid parts of the land, one's mind 
turns to camping and all things summer.

Mine particularly due to my current life situation, as this is the last 
summer I'll have off for likely 7-8 years. Anyway I've been on the 
mailists forever now I guess, and have watched many a good trip come 
and go back when I was working and had no vacation time. As this 
break between my first and second years of med school is my last 
chance while relatively young to take an epic trip, I'm going to do so, 
and I intend to for at least part of that trip, duplicate the &quot;Top of the 
Word Tour&quot; route of Tobin, Ron, and all the others back in 1996 as I 
wanted to go badly at that time. That is Vancouver to Inuvik.

I know this isn't particularly original, and frankly I'm doing a summer 
long trek around the country in general as well as this, but I got to 
thinking that there have not been any really epic group or personal 
Bus camping journeys now in a few years reported on the list. I think 
that stinks, and I'm ready to take up the task of organizing something 
to do about it.

My basic thoughts are to pretty much duplicate the '96 route and to do 
it around the same time this summer, say starting early/mid July 2000. 
I understand only too well how hard it is for most people to arrange a big 
enough block of time to do something like this, but would be happy to 
have anyone interested get in touch with me.

I thought they were doing the Tierra del Fuego? thing or whatever this 
year but that has either got lost in the shuffle or is next year, so if 
anyone wants to celebrate summer 2000 in northern style, get back 
with me. (Actually I understand it is still on but an 8 month trip...)

Anyway, I'm posting to all the lists, seriously interested parties who can 
actually take a month off (not including getting to Vancouver and back) 
please contact me. I also don't know a damn thing about that side of the 
north country which is why I want to do it there, not on the east coast, 
so anyone with intimate knowledge of the area who can suggest routes, 
improvements, etc, please chime up.

The route and info about the first trip can be found on:
http://www.vanagon_dot_com/journeys/inuvik/index.html

If we get enough interest going, perhaps I'll start up another little list to 
handle planning. Also if there is interest in doing something like a couple 
week Baja trip instead, I'm all for that as well. I'd prefer to go north
but it

doesn't really matter to me. Like I said I'm going to do it alone regardless 
but Bus/Vanagon company is always good company to have.
