Subject: RE:Parting out (whats left of) a 78 Westy =&gt; Camping stool

I went to the green monster's page to check the parts out for my 78,
nothing I don't have already though.

But, I saw the link for camping stools and checked it out. I had no idea
the yellow bucket that came with my first camper was the &quot;Official VW Trash
Liner&quot;. I have just been using it as a bucket for the past 12 years. I
think I still have the lid around somewhere...

I guess I'll offer it up to someone who needs it to complete their &quot;show
bus&quot;, I hardly ever use my stool. Anybody interested? I also have a spare
stool in blue/green in bad condition, not sure it's worth the money it
would cost to ship.

Jeff
78 Westy
