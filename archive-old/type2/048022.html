Subject: Re: [T2] restoration process

Start with the body...

Paint inside and then outside and the bottom (KILL THE RUST! - &lt;grin!&gt;)

Remove the windows before all the painting and then replace them when your 
done.

You are basically replaying the factory assembly process -- build the body 
and then attach the mechanicals and then the drive train and then the 
interior...

If you plan to drive this bus at the same time - you will have to design 
your own version of this process.

This is what I have done in the past.

My version while I drive the bus is fix everything as you go along in order 
of budget and importance. Brakes first -- hehe. Engine next. Electrics as 
the problems come up. This will give you good exposure to what parts cost 
and the true quanity of rust the old car REALLY has (always 2.817 times 
more than I thought it had before I got started...)

Eventually if I feel like the bus is getting fixed right and staying fixed 
and if I STILL like the vehicle then I'll test my love with bodywork and 
the high cost of paint jobs.

Lastly still comes the inside.

Usually this takes years.... &lt;grin&gt;

Keep us updated...

&gt;Hi listees and gurus,
&gt;
&gt;I have a 72 bay window bus that I want to restore and I am looking for
&gt;suggestions on how to proceed.  The engine is good, as well as the other
&gt;mechanical aspects except for the heater fan.  The fan works but the switch
&gt;does not.  The fuse in the engine compartment has been cut out which I
&gt;replaced but still no luck.  I get heat, but I really want a defroster in the
&gt;front on rainy days.  Any ideas?
&gt;
&gt;Anyway, the interior is good in most parts and I have found places to replace
&gt;most of the bad stuff.  The only real rust is in the inside of the
&gt;windshield, no holes, just rust.  Can the piece that is in-between the
&gt;windshield and the dash be replaced?  In regard to painting; do I paint
&gt;inside and the outside?  I want to replace the window rubber, should this be
&gt;done before or after painting?  I will have a professional do the work.
&gt;Should I do the interior work before the painting or after or does it really
&gt;matter?
&gt;
&gt;This is my daily driver and as I will have the exterior done professionally,
&gt;I know of  and am not really worried too much about the cost.  This is one
&gt;that I will keep for a long, long time.  It is in good shape that I want to
&gt;be restored to showroom perfection.  Any help on what to do first or last
&gt;will be truly appreciated.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks in advance,
&gt;Rob
