&gt;The problem is that a galvanized bus would not be considered &quot;perfect&quot; by
&gt;the concours restoration types, as it was not original.

Didn't car mfgrs start doing that to bodies in the 80s? It sure make them last longer.

&gt;In the concours Ford Model T competitions, the winner is often determined
&gt;by who has the correct plating on certain bolts on the transmission!
&gt;Galvanizing the whole car would drop it right out of the running!

I saw a 50s beetle up on the lift at a restoration shop last weekend that was &quot;over restored&quot; as the shop owner put it. It was cleaner that when it left the factory, even part painted the correct original color and all of the fasteners were yellow chromate plated.
