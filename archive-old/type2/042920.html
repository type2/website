&gt;I believe that your carb has a leak allowing fuel to flow as you have said.
&gt;But instead of washing oil away, I think that one or more of your cylinders
&gt;filled with fuel, thus creating a hydraulic lock condition.  

I think this is a good possibility.  Exactly the same thing happened to a
1959 Porshe 1600 I once owned (convertible with a hard top - wish I still
had it).  The needle valve on one carb was leaking, and if I parked with
the nose higher than the rear, and if an intake on the side with the bad
carb was open, that cylinder would fill with gas and the engine wouldn't
turn over. Drove me nuts for a couple of days.

Ian, 82 Westie that my wife won't drive anymore because she has scraped the
passenger side three times now.
