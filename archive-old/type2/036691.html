Subject: replacing roof panel in 70 Westy 

Bussers,
Here's hoping I can tap the list's wisdom regarding an unusual situation.  I
have 2 1970 Westy's, well sort of.  The operating bus, (the Turtle), the one
with solid body, and on the road right now was originally a &quot;station wagon&quot;,
with a Westy interior bolted in, and the roof was roughly cut out for the
pop-top which was tacked on.  #2 parts bus, an original Westy, has a very
nice pop top with upper bed frame and of course the reinforced double roof
with places for the upper bed and the hold down brackets, not to mention the
smooth reinforced cutout from the factory.  Here's the dilemma.  I have
given away the pop top off the Turtle in preparation for a complete paint
job.  Should I have the body shop cut out the roof from the real Westy and
transplant it into the Turtle?  Or am I opening up a can of worms and should
I just settle for an installation like before.  I've done all the mechanical
work on the Turtle myself, but I'm leaving body work and paint to a pro.
Any input would be welcome.
