Subject: Re: [T2] AIRS Spreadsheet List?
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Im currently talking with a local about making a better way to print
up/search up/pull up the AIRS list. Hope to have it setup better soon but
we'll see.  We have spoken of many user self-performed tasks and so
forth...nothing is in stone yet. Also want to make it so users can self edit
their own entries but fear the unrulys doin what we wouldnt want done if you
know what i mean

&gt;I tried cutting and pasting from AIRS to a
&gt;spreadsheet, then editing the spreadsheet......&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;wondered if anyone had an easier way to do this.
