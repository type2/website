Subject: Re: [T2] my new bus

I would certainly recommend buying the John Muir book right off the 
bat, it will give you great insight into why your bus does what it 
does. Plus its a good read. (How to Keep Your Volkswagen Alive 19 Ed: A 
Manual of Step-by-Step Procedures for the Compleat Idiot)

When I first got my Safare I went through my engine bay cleaning,  
replacing hoses, cleaning electrical contacts, lubing and &quot;tidying up&quot; 
(Clean up that oil/gunk, zip tie wires etc). Getting a handle on what 
goes where is nice so when something does cease to function, you aren't 
left scratching your head. Also by going through and seeing what is 
what you can take the time to make sure all your connections are in 
place and that all your nuts and bolts are nice and tight. Keeping it 
clean makes it MUCH easier to keep things running smoothly. If you 
haven't poked around you really never know what's going on back there 
if you aren't the Original owner. Who knows what's new and exciting. If 
it looks sketchy replace it.

FUEL LINES are something everyone here will stress as a MUST DO, its 
easy to do and you can at least remove that from the list of things to 
stress about.

Steve
