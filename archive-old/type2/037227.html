&gt; ok...
&gt; wonderful evening here in WI...
&gt; this problem started 2 days ago....she got really hard to shift and
&gt; would grind gears whenever shifting.  I thought it was the clutch cable
&gt; stretching or breaking...so i adjusted it...no help.  I bought a new
&gt; clutch cable and bowden tube and adjusted them. no help. the old clutch
&gt; cable is perfect btw...   I adjusted it all the way down...no help at
&gt; all.  the clutch pedal is still too soft...and it doesn't pull the arm
&gt; on the trans far enough to disengage the clutch.  I have no idea
&gt; whatsoever as to what is happening.

If the cable is good, then the problem is probably at one end or the
other.  I'm betting on a broken clutch fork, but it could also be a worn
out lever on the clutch pedal pivot.  If youare getting full motion on the
clutch arm on the transmission, then you need to pull the engine and check
the throwout fork and shaft.

Seek and ye shall find the problem.
