Subject: Where to mount oil cooler?

First, thanks to all who replied about my vacuum and over-heating
problems. I am still in the process of trying out all the ideas I
received. 

I have a 71'bus and am going to mount an oil cooler. Any ideas on where
is the best place to mount it?  As always TIA TBear

Don't take life to seriously--you'll never live through it.
