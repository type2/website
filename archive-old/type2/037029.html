Subject: grinding gears..

Hey all...
This is persistent even after re-adjusting my clutch cable....and it is
adjusted correctly.
When I shift...2nd is sometimes hard to get into...especially if
downshifting.  When at a dead stop..I try to put it in 1st...and it
grinds.  If I hold the shifter up against first while stopping...and
then pop it in once I'm stopped...it goes right in....and then on to 2nd
with no problem.  I have no problems with 3rd and 4th.

Reverse likes to grind too....just when putting it in reverse.  all
gears drive nice...and none pop out.

When i shift though....they kind of *pop* into place...or the shifter
does..but I think that is just my shift plate....

any ideas?
