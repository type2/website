Subject: re: [T2] Raby

&gt; Speaking of which, and I realize the price varies greatly, but what's the ballpark &gt; figure for a stock 2L engine these days?

Sorry to post this under Jake's title, but Boston Bob is building mine now, a vanagon square port for $2300.  It's strictly stock with mostly new parts and his improvements.  I composed an email to Jake as he suggests, but when I got done with it, I never sent it because I realized that what I wanted was probably better suited to Bob's approach.  WADR to Jake....
