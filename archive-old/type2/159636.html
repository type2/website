Subject: Driving the bus in snow

Hey Everyone,
I'm going to be heading up to Big Bear, CA for the next few weeks and 
I'm sure I'm probably going to encounter some snow.  How does the bus 
drive in the snow?  I have all season tires on there, but I'm guessing 
that I'm probably still going to need chains if it does snow 
significantly.  I'm thinking that it should be relatively descent 
because the engine's over the drive wheels, but I just wanted to check. 
  I've driven a bunch of vehicles in snowy conditions, but never my bus.

Thanks!
Mike
