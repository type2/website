...lots of good information and advice about replacing fuel lines deleted...

Chris, Holly, and others,

One of the points made in this post was that you should use clamps on fuel lines. This has raised some eyebrows on the list in the past, and although I agree that clamps are good (not everyone does), we should all remember that on some parts--especially the fuel pump and carburator on older buses, including early bays--the fuel enters in or exits through a pipe that is installed with an interference fit. Just as important as assuring your fuel lines do not pop off under pressure (thus, the clamps) is making sure these interference fits don't pop out under pressure.

I'm talking about the brass tubes that stick out of your carb and fuel pump. I'd recommend, with the bus cold, trying to pull these out by hand...or with mild tugs using plyers or some such tool to hold the tubes while you pull. They're going to have to withstand the internal pressure produced by pumping your fuel, because, if they pop out, you'll be spilling gas all over the place.

If one or more of these pop out, there are a couple of things you can do to fix them. Keep in mind that your objective is a tight, leak-free fit. I have made loose fittings grab by knurling the sides of the fitting (dragging pliers down the sides to displace metal, creating a rise and a pit) and putting it back in place. I've also replaced fittings for slightly larger, better-fitting ones. If you choose to knurl, be sure not to bend or damage the fitting and be sure to check for leaks. If you can get a good, new fitting, knurling isn't a good substitute, but if you realize your fittings are falling out while you're at Grandma's eating turkey, knurling may be the field-fix that you need.

Hope I've made sense in this post. If I haven't, well, I've only had one cup of coffee so far; catch me after I've loaded down on triptophan(sp?).

The other thing to remember is that you need the correct, metric-sized fuel lines for your bus. There are American-standard sized lines that are close, but they only work with tight clamps and that doesn't give me the fit I want for *my* bus. I don't remember the right size, so I won't hazard a guess. Anyone remember?

Thanks! Joe
