Subject: COLD trip report

here's a minor trip report...I took a buddy and his daughter  80 miles up
I-15 to Shelby so he could take the Amtrak over to AnnArbor Michigan for
Christmas.   The wind is out of the north and our best speed on the way up
was 55mph, median speed being about 45.  I did manage 60-65mph on the way
home.   I just recently rehabbed my BN4 heater and what good timing!  It's
-2* right now and winds of 18mph, weather channel says thats -34
windchill... It was substantially colder this morning with blowing/drifting
snow.  I desperately need to drop the $ and get some new door seals from Ron
Salmon.  The wind switched from one side to the other of the bus and the guy
on the upwind side was suffering!  Steve's daughter snuggled the heat output
hole under the back seat and was fine.   
 2.5hrs on the way up and 1.5hrs on the way home.
Here's a tech question, what's the preferred glue/adhesive when redoing the
door seals?
take care, stay warm.
