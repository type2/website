Generally ground clearance will not be a problem, especially in the rear.  Plus I would worry about the upper shock mounts if you jacked up the air shocks and started hitting bumps at speed.  You need to think about the biggest weak points of the bus - traction in sand (wider tires) and mud (more aggressive tires).  BFG All-terrain TA/KO tires in 27x8.5x14 is probably the best mod you can make to your bus for offroading, and it won't destroy the streetability, since it is your daily driver.

You might also consider a limited slip differential, but they are expensive.

Finally, strip unnecessary stuff out of the bus to keep it as light as possible.  

Carry some long 2x10 planks, some and a big floor jack for insurance.

Lots of us want our busses to be great offroad too.  Most of us have ended up accepting the fact that it is difficult and expensive to make a bus good offroad, and we have learned to accept the limitations of our busses and leave the true 4-wheeling to the Jeeps and Hummers.
