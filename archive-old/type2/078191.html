Subject: volume control screw source

I ordered a rebuild kit for my 34PICT-3 carb, hoping that it would contain
a volume control screw to replace the one I &quot;loaned&quot; my son for his bug.
The kit arrived.  No such screw is included.

Is there a mail order source for individual parts like this?

Jack
