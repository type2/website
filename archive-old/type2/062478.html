Yes, though they have a lower pressure than ideal.  Photo supply 
people have them, used to blow stuff off negatives.
Or, you could just cheat and haul the carb down to the local gas 
station that has air, and use theirs.

&gt; buy one to rebuild my carb. Any thoughts? Does anyone sell cans of 
&gt; compressed air?
