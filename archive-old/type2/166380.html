Subject: Re: [T2] Paint code for 71 Westy's Pop Top?

Hi Trey,

There is no spoon.... I mean paint code.

Factory baywindow westfalias were bare fibreglass. If yours  was  
painted, it's not factory paint.

Over six years ago I painted mine with a quart of white InterLux  
Premium Yacht Enamel, and it still looks great.

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
