 you????


There is another option, find a local listee that is good with his/her VW
and see if they will let you hand out with them when they work on theirs. Or
see if they will help you learn on yours. I have done this for people in my
area, and will do it again if asked. My only requirements are that 1 you
come to me, and 2 we work together, not me do it all while you are off
working on something else.  
 I did go to a fellow VWers house to do some work, and he decided to go off
and work on another project while I fixed his VW for free. Never again. Make
sure you let this person know that you want to learn, and that you are not
there just to have them be your slave. 
  I know that there are listees who will do this for you. The VW community
as a whole is very helpful when it comes to other VW owners, most will go
out of there way to help you and give advice. 
  Most VW shops I have seen are friendly and helpful, but will not let you
hang out in there shop to let you watch. Part of it has to do with
insurance, the other is that then they would have to let everyone do it and
that just would not work.
  Also, most listees will help for free, but if they are helping with a big
job, spending lots of their free time to help you, be sure to offer to pay
them in some way. They may refuse, but at least offer. I will build bridges
and keep you in their favor for a long time. They will also be more willing
to help you out next time.
  I hope this helps, and did not get off topic too far.
