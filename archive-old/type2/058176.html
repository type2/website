Subject: BBTA trip report, day one (long!)

This account purports to be nothing more than some
random musings collected here at midnight the day I got
home from BBTA; as a writing exercise it has its
genesis in a conversation Charlie Ford and I had the
other night. Namely, how no one writes trip reports
anymore, and how the truth about an event like busses
lies mainly, but not solely, in the head and heart of
the person who experiences an event (or more to the
point, a series of events) that lead to a conclusion
about whether something was worthwhile, should be
repeated, or will be remembered well.  I am a gradual
student in educational psychology, and because of that
I am more apt, perhaps, than the next person to ask
questions about an event and about group dynamics to
try to understand what it is that happened.  As a poet,
the experience of two hot days in Missouri is both
quite a bit and not much.  Anyway, enough pawing the
ground, here goes:
Friday my seven year old son Thomas and I snuck out of
Bloomington after picking up the requisite supply of
groceries, sodas, and beer.  Thomas is a wonderful kid,
but tends to be very structured and inflexible about
things.  Perhaps road-tripping with him gives me a
chance to work on this aspect of his personality. 
Driving a '71 bus (even one as reliable as mine has
been) requires a certain willingness to suspend
adherence to set schedules, to count blessings in
driving a place to stay and eat if one breaks down, and
to stop at the cool looking stuff along the way.  We
headed north on the twisty rolling hills of route 46
towards Terre Haute; it is a beautiful drive.  It
reminds me to read again Least Heat Moon's Blue
Highways.  You see, along this route, the beautiful
small Indiana towns spun out along the miles; the
McDonald's, the post office, the (to quote Robert Bly)
small main streets abandoned all night.  About 6:30 or
so we went through such a town, Riley, Indiana.  In the
middle of Riley was a small restaurant called the Life
of Riley, and we had to stop.  I slowed, signaled to
make a turn around in a nearby sidestreet, and then
heard the squealing of minivan brakes.  Someone had
been spacing out and nearly killed us before we had the
chance to get going.  The restaurant was wonderful:
everyone who worked there was a member of the same
family, the appetizer was home-made potato chips and
home-made french onion dip; there were just a few
locals dispersed through the restaurant.  The husband
was making the rounds, the wife doing the waitressing
and hustling, the kids making the food.  It was
wonderful: a ribeye, home-made deepfried biscuits, hand
peeled potatoes^Åfor $6.95.  Under glass on the table
tops were black and white pictures of Terre Haute,
labled, but obviously old.  The wife said they had
found them in a box.  She had no idea who took them,
who wrote the labels or why.
Thomas and I left smiling, left under the stares of the
regulars.  I suppose Riley doesn't often have a bright
teals bus stop on its mainstreet.  We jumped on I-70
and headed west.  It is impossible to describe the most
beautiful, most dear things in life.  What words can I
choose to say what it is to move in a bus which I love,
through the darkening sky and cornfields and soybeans,
which I love, listening to high school football games
on the radio with my blond son sitting in contented
silence by my side.  He looks at me and smiles; I touch
his close-cropped blonde hair, his shoulder, in silence
and noise.  There is no better definition of love, of
peace than that touching and smiling in the darkness.
In the middle of Illinois, the red generator light
suddenly came on.  I knew (from reading Muir too many
hours) what that meant: broken fanbelt.  I saw a sign
that said an exit was a mile away, and I pulled into
the far right (and rode the rumble strips) to an exit
and an Amoco station.  There was bright light, and
opening the engine hatch I could see a shredded fanbelt
and smoke: the engine had gotten so hot in the two
minutes (or had gotten hotter: I had been travelling
for two or so hours at 70mph, and it was still, even at
10pm, in the mid-eighties) that leaked engine oil was
smoking.  I changed the fanbelt (and felt cocky and
pleased in my having brought one) and let the engine
cool while we bought some M&amp;M's.  
Back on the road again, McGwire has gone 0-4, the game
is over.  The moon is full and orange over my shoulder,
and we cross a canal, then the Mississippi, then the
Missouri.  We are driving 60mph or so in a
construction-narrowed one lane, cars are hurtling
towards us just on the other side of a concrete
barrier, their brights making my bug-splashed
windshield a nightmare to see out of.  Finally, we turn
on route 79 and head north.  There is no one in the
office, no one in the center of the campout.  We wake
my wife up to tell her that we have arrived.  Making
our way to the edge of the open field, we notice
several splitties already circled.  As we begin to set
up our tent it is still (by the account of the  radio)
82 degrees at 11:30.  The mosquitos swarm, we cover
ourselves with OFF, and get the tent set up.  After
midnight, sweating, we go to bed.  The splitty folks
are laughing, music playing.   One of them has an
ambulance, and at 1:30 the siren goes off, and someone
is yelling over a loudspeaker.  At 2:15, I lose it.  I
go over to talk to them, to ask them to be quiet.  I
feel awful and old and foolish doing it, like I'm
violating some kind of &quot;spirit of busses&quot;, but I am
crazy with fatigue.  The look at me in a way which
means that they will stop, but that I am to be pitied. 
Finally at 3, I drift off.  Thomas, like an alarm
clock, wakes up at 6:45.  Saturday has begun at BBTA.
