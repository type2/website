Subject: RE: Sticking a tap in a heater box

You can't just tap sheet metal like that, it doesn't work.  The heater boxes
have clinch/weld nut inserts on them (like your engine tin).  You might be
able to use a self tapping screw, #12 maybe, or weld a nut on, but it needs
to go on the inside so things get tricky.  Do you know any mice with welding
skills?

&gt; fresh arm. However, the heater boxes I put on don't seem to 
&gt; have a hole for
&gt; the bottom end of the damn thing.
&gt; 
&gt; So:
&gt; 
&gt; Where do I tap?
&gt; If I go tapping holes into the heater boxes, am I gonna get 
&gt; an exhaust leak?
&gt; Any suggestions for alternate methods?
