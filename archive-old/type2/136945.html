Subject: Re: [T2] Importing Vehicle From Mexico

&lt;&lt; I remember a while ago someone on the list mentioned that they brought a
newer-Old Beetle into the US from Mexico. I would like to do this to
Canada, and was wondering how one goes about doing it.

Thanks,

Good luck...The Mexican Beetle doesn't meet either USA or Canada
regs (close, but there are differences) so even a physical importation
would not result in a car that can be registered or driven...The &quot;only&quot;
Mexican Beetles that made it across the border were &quot;restorations&quot;
of an existing Beetle and used the original VIN and (IIRC) floorpan
as the basis of the restoration...`
