Subject: RE: [T2] valve adjusting wrench

I just have a cheap set of wrenches that look like they came from the
bargin bin at a local
Parts supplier. They work perfectly for adjusting valves in my opinion.

Subject: [T2] valve adjusting wrench


Hi all,

Has anyone found a good 13mm box end wrench for adjusting valves. I've
tried several, none have a really good fit, and the angle seems awkward.
Consequently, the nuts are rounding off with each adjustment. thanks
Crisp
