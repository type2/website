&gt; Spot on, David. In one paragraph. All true. If your a novice, allow
&gt;  yourself the afternoon to get that upper tin and head off. And mark
&gt;  everything and keep notes. Digital pix are auschgeseitnet to  document vos

Hmmm,

David is cleverer than I.

We dropped the engine in China Cat (75 Westy) just about 7:30 EDT. I pulled 
the rockers and stud nuts from the left side so I could get a look at the 
pistons/cylinders before quitting.

Well, it seems that that bit of tin below the damper and behind the oil 
cooler *must* come off before the head can. However, there is a tin fastener 
(apparently) below and behind the rear cylinder that requires that the head 
be off in order to remove *it* :-)

Awaiting daylight, I'll read from all these expensive books I bought last 
week to see if the solution is in there.

It was quite a thrill to get the engine out. Much more satisfying than the 
watercooled 4s, 6s, and 8s that I've pulled before.

Thanks all for the interesting information presented on the T-2 list. Many of 
the questions I would have had were answered in the two weeks that I've 
lurked.

Cheers/Don Carron
