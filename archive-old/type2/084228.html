Subject: Further,Re: [T2] Nikki's Bus, another question...


Further futzing...discovered #3 ain't firing. Gotta wait 'til Nikki's
back from the vet so she can slip her hand in there and remove the plug,
my big honkin' hands don't seem to go there.

Any input will be mucho appreciated.

&gt; Art here,
&gt;  Nikki's off to the vet with her latest cat rescue and I've been futzing
&gt; with the engine in her absence.
