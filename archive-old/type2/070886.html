Hello all.
I just purchased a 70 bus. The PO removed the engine and at some point also 
ran some new wire from the front of the bus to the rear. He also installed 
some generic fuse box. I am now at the point where I put in a motor I pulled 
out of another bus, but I am not quite sure what I need electrically to get 
the motor running. I know that I will have to break down and get new wire 
harness eventually. Until then though I want to make sure my motor runs good 
What do I need to just get the motor running and the battery charging.

Any help ideas greatly appreciated
