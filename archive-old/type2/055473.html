&gt;
&gt;Hi,
&gt;   We have started a registry for 1961-65 front flip-seat westfalias.
&gt;Goals are to find out how many of these westies still exsist.  Share
&gt;information on these campers and assist with the location of (Especially
&gt;interior.) parts.  If you know of anybody in your area who owns a flip-seat
&gt;westie or the location of a camper that can be saved or parted out to save
&gt;other westies.  Please email at VeeWee111_at_aol_dot_com or call 360-754-6174
&gt;Thanks, Barb &amp; Eric
&gt;  P.S.  If you are unsure of what a flip-seat westie looks like.  Terry Z. has
&gt;a couple of photos on his web page http://www.olywa_dot_net/terryz/vw.html  of his
&gt;westie.
&gt;  P.P.S. Some of these westies were made with wood paneling instead of the
&gt;white formica, but the cabinets and seat layout remained the same.
