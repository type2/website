I have used the windshield lower lip repair kit from the bulli haus.It comes
as a three piece section. The corner pieces didn't fit well at all,But I
didn't need them anyway.The center section worked well though, without to much
tweeking to make it fit ,or so I am told by the guy that did the bodywork .
The kit cost around 45.00 from what I remember.If you do need the corner
pieces I would ask when you order if they have been fixed and that you were
told these did not fit well.
