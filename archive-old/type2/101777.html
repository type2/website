Subject: Just got a no seatbelt ticket... has there been a study done
  saying that belts in a bus would do nothing to prevent injury?

Hey folks,
Yep, just got pulled over. The anti Bush jokes on the
bumper musta rubbed a raw nerve in someone. 
I was ticketed for going 44 in a 35 and for not
wearing a seatbelt. Speeding I can go along with but
the seatbelt is a joke to me. For one I have Nissan
seats in my bus which are higher than the stock ones
and make it hard to shift. Adding a seatbelt to that
would restrict my shoulder movement and make shifting
all but impossible. Just wondering if there is any
hard evidence out there showing the value of wearing a
seatbelt in a '78 T2. It seems logical to me that if
your already, as Muir put it, strapped like an Aztec
sacrifice to the front of the bus, that you would have
no where to go in the event of a collision. I may be
wrong. 
Thanks for any thoughts,
Giles
