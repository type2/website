Joel,
There's no doubt that you can cruise all day at 79 mph.  Just be aware that
if you choose to do so, the engine won't last as long as it would if you
cruised along at 55 mph.  No argument, just a simple fact.

Continued high rpm operation puts a lot of stress on any engine, and if you
put an oil temp gauge on a Type 4 you will see that once you get above about
70 mph or so that temp starts to go up dramatically and quickly.  In cold
weather it's not really a problem but when summer rolls around, cooling
becomes a pretty important issue.

Nothing wrong with cruising your Bus at 80, just don't expect the engine to
last 100,000 miles before you have to do major work, especially if you are
driving an air-cooled Vanagon and/or a Bus with AC.  I think that's what
John is getting at with his post about driving by the oil temp gauge rather
than the speedometer.

&gt; Volks- I don't know why I keep seeing this same topic popping up, but
there
&gt; seems to be this errant belief that busses were not meant to travel above
55
&gt; because the speed limit was 55 at one time (!).  LOOK IN YOUR OWNER'S
MANUAL.
&gt;  I have a '74 westy (T4 1800cc) and my manual clearly says:
&gt; TOP SPEED: 79mph
&gt; CRUISING SPEED: 79mph
&gt; This is how VW designed them- to be run at high RPMs.
