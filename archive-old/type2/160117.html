&gt; Wow.  And I thought I spoke English.  I propose a new act of  congress
&gt; calling our language 'American' to help completely sever our  ties to our
English
&gt; past.  We obvioulsy took a wrong turn sometime  back.  Or maybe it's Maori
&gt; slang.  Can any of our English  friends offer enlightenment?  Plurry,
&gt; drongo,   prexie...  Methinks the King would not be pleased!

&quot;England and America are two countries separated by a common language.&quot;

BTW, would that be a Racket-tailed Drongo, a Hair-crested Drongo, or
just a Run-of-the-mill Idiot... ?-)
