Subject: Bad compression

Just checking the compression on my unknown
condition engine.  It was &quot;rebuilt&quot;-- whatever
that means-- prior to my purchase of the
westfakia.  I've been generally impressed with
the engine... no leaks at all, apparently new
universal case, no apparently end play problem,
no noises.

But I had a vacuum leak and a few less than
perfect engine tin issues causing it to run hot
lately.  I fixed the leak and was determined to
do SOMETHING about the tin (I have the bug tin
causing a gap upfront).  Compression check shows 


#3  110       #1   110
#4  140       #2    80

EEEEEEEKS.  My whole intention in this venture
was to adjust the valves.  I'm ashamed to admit
that I haven't for months and several thousand
miles.  

Any sense in adjusting the valves?  That's not
going to overcome that kind of numbers, right? 
Should I just pull the engine and the heads?  

Time is tight.  Running to Phoenix is a five hour
propositon but I could do it and return with two
new heads.  The ones on the bus, if rebuildable,
could then be repaired and saved as spares.  

What sayeth my wise VW brothers and sisters? 
Please respond directly to me as I read on digest
mode.
