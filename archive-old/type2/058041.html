Hey Folks!

This is my first post to the list since my move from Portland, Or. to
Prescott, Az. and I've got a whole bunch of questions, so PLEASE bear
with me.

I had several perplexing problems on the move here and I'm hoping
someone can and will, shed some light on them for me.

First of all, I've got a '69 Westy Poptop w/1600 sp, .009, 30/31 Solex
(Brazilian), Bosch Alternator and S&amp;J exhaust.

Problem #1- Just outside of S.F., I saw the Gen. light come on and the
radio turned off at the same time. Pulled over immediately. Good thing
too. Lots of oil all over (we'll get to that in problem #2!!!), but
the obvious problem was the alternator had somehow spun around and was
grounding-out on the carburetor!! I spun it back in place and replaced
the melted wire. What I missed (it being dark and my being in a hurry
because of the scary neighborhood we were in) was that ALL FOUR of the
screws holding the alternator tin in place had fallen out! I also
missed the fact that when it grounded out, it arc-welded a hole in the
diaphragm cover on the carburetor, thereby causing a SUBSTANTIAL fuel
leak. 

Luckily, (I guess) problem #2 required a mechanic and he caught both
of these things.

Problem #2- The oil leak got progressively worse, to the point that in
Stockton (LOVELY little town!!!), it was spewing out almost as fast as
I could pour it in (no exaggeration). 

The mechanic I found said (after pulling the motor out and apart) that
it was the oil cooler, which is what I had suspected. I had recently
installed a used dog-house set-up, but it apparently had a pin-hole in
it. The resulting leak apparently allowed not only the screws on the
alternator tin, but the bolts to the cooling tower as well, to vibrate
loose.

So, $500.00 later (did I mention the aging tranny went out as I was
pulling into the mechanic?!), I'm on the road again. But there's a
noise that just isn't right, so back I went. Warped fan. I had used a
brand new one (and it was less than a month old), but apparently they
aren't as good as they used to be.

So I get a new fan and all is well. Made it to Arizona without any
further problems. But NOW the new fan (less than 1,000 miles) is
making the same sound, leading me to believe it's warped as well.

So....my questions..

1- what's causing this fan warpage and how dangerous is it? The
alternator is new, I installed it about 3 months ago. Could it be the
cause?

2- What's the proper procedure for by-passing the choke on a 30/31
Solex? It doesn't like to shut off and I'd really rather do without.

3- I recently (3 months ago) installed KYB gas adjusts all the way
'round. After 600 miles, I had to replace the front driver-side, as it
leaked. Now both of the front are leaking!! These have less than 3,000
miles on them! The front-end was recently inspected and was passed, so
I assume all else is well. Anyone else have this problem?  

4- Any ideas on getting more power at 5,500 feet of elevation? I've
adjusted the carb, but the bus still feels anemic to me.


Sorry for all the bandwidth, but these are serious concerns for me and
I REALLY would appreciate any help.


Jaime
