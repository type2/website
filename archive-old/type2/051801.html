That's what I thought.  Every bus I've seen has the hardboard, but these
look almost like they were always there.  I like them, much better than the
stock, and they hold up much better.

&gt; Michael,
&gt;
&gt; I will not say they are not factory, I've never owned a '72, but I will
&gt; say on all the buses I have ever owned ('67, 68, 70, 73, 78, 79) they were
&gt; hardboard with either black paint or black vinyl, not metal.
