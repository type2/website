Subject: Re: [T2] scratching head after several repairs???

Will,

To diagnose your problem I would like to ask you for four more pieces of
data:

What is your vacuum reading warm?
What are your compression readings cold?
What are your compression readings warm?
Have you had a leak down test performed on this engine?

After reading your post, I have some guesses but without adequate
information, they would be just that... guesses.

                             OOK!
