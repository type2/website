Subject: Re: brake servo questions

&gt;&gt;What was the temperature difference before and after you replaced this? 

I rely on my senses when judging temp. On a type 4 engine, touching the 
dipstick isn't enough to check the temp. I usually
drive it a short way, then open the compartment and smell. does it smell hot? 
I put my hand flat on the top of the fan housing.
If it's running hot your hand will burn, under normal conditions you should 
be able to lay your hand there with no problem. the metal should be cool to 
the touch. Don't try that with the shroud though.

&gt; My engine seems to run a bit warm and I have run out of things to look at. 
&gt;When you replaced yours, did you have two separate inserts in the hose
&gt;between the servo and the intake manifold?  Reason I ask, is  that when I
&gt;replaced my servo hose, there was the one way air check that had an arrow
&gt;pointing to where the motor is and then it also had some sort of breather
&gt;insert as well.  This breather insert was essentially a T that you spliced
&gt;into the hose and then the third outlet just went out into the open.

The dual carb setup on my motor had been scrapped. In it's place is a center 
mount Holley 5200 series double barrel carburator, probably designed for an 
early 70's ford pinto or maverick. Someone made a metal box for it to sit on, 
with four 
holes for the intake manifolds, and one smaller port for the vacum line to 
the servo. There was no sign of a &quot;T&quot; connector
running the length of the hose, and this makes sense because I'm assuming 
that would have been necessary only for dual carbs, my guess is that hose 
split in front of the firewall and the vacuum line originally ran seperately 
to the two carbs. 

If you have anything going out into the open I would plug it as tightly as 
you can. Any leaks in the line between the carb and the servo allow air to 
leak into the intake manifolds without the carbs knowledge, therefore the 
carbs can't meter the appropriate amount of fuel to correspond with the extra 
air. It's called &quot;false air&quot; and causes the mixture in the combustion ports 
to be too lean (not enough fuel for the air) and that causes hot running and 
ultimately engine failure.  I would follow that hose from the carb or carbs 
port(s) all the way to the servo and make sure it isn't leaking anywhere. Use 
new hose clamps and don't be afraid to save up and replace the line entirely 
if' it's cracked and brittle. Use only steel reinforced scotch guard line 
from the dealer or an appropriate aftermarket line. The one-way air check 
arrow should point toward the engine. Next buy a carb rebuild kit for your 
carb(s) and replace the &quot;Base&quot; gasket. These two procedures will go a long 
way toward eliminating vacuum leaks and the hot running that the leaks cause.
