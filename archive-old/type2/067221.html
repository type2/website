Subject: Questionable &quot;rescue&quot; last night

Well, I went to pick up the '59 DD Panel last night.  I am not 
calling this one a Search &amp; Rescue because #1: I found out about 
this bus over 6 months ago &amp; #2: If I had not gotten it, someone 
else surely would have.

Back when I first heard about it he wanted $800 for it &amp; I passed 
after talking with him.  He lives with his wife &amp; mother-in-law 
and they said something had to go, &amp; this &quot;project&quot; was in the worst 
shape.

Everyone saw the description in the ad.  Here's the real poop:  
No front nose skin with strange remaining metal up front.  I asked 
him what he used to cut the nose skin off with and he replied &quot;tin 
snips&quot;.  

Thinking I had heard him wrong I said, &quot;Tin snips?&quot;, to which he 
replied, &quot;Yeah.  Took me about 20 minutes.  I used to install car 
stereos.&quot;

I honestly had no idea what nose skins and car stereos had to do 
with each other, but I decided not to push the issue.

The bus needs a nose skin transplant, new cab floor corners, dog 
legs, rocker panels, battery trays, rear corners, transmission, 
engine, wiring harness, driver's door, 15&quot; bus wheels, lenses, 
instruments...

Uh, this list goes on &amp; on...  I have a shell.

Good points:  It is a 1959 Double Door Walk Thru Panel (semi rare).  

At least I have the skills &amp; patience to put it back together.
I like it!

Dave
