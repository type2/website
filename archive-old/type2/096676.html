Subject: valve train geometry

Maybe it is August in the Northern Virginia area that has made me 
irritable, but I found the articles in the September issue of VW 
Trends to be even more disappointing than usual.  Hence this rant.

Two cases in point.

The photos in the valve train geometry article are, in my opinion, 
real poorly done.  The criterion that one uses to decide if the 
geometry is ok is evidently to get the stroke half way and then , (as 
stated)  &quot;........... to correct the plane of valve stem to adjuster 
screw&quot;.  I'm afraid this doesn't help much. Can someone describe the 
goal and maybe give insight into why it is important?

Secondly, I had high hopes for reading the thoughts of the engine 
builders, but ended up not learning  much from them.  I was taken by 
two comments, however:  (a) there seems to be a consensus that 
inferior parts constitutes the biggest problem  in building an 
engine, and (b) that we should not expect our engines to run as new. 
Am I to understand that (a) leads to  (b)?  Does everyone agree that 
is not possible to rebuild an engine and get like-new performance?

Your thoughts,  please?
