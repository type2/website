Subject: Airconditioning system for a 1974 VW Bus.
Message-Id: &lt;199907061857.NAA09633_at_ux13.cso.uiuc_dot_edu&gt;

Hello everyone,

	I was wondering if anyone is interested in purchasing the
airconditioning system I removed from my vehicle.  I'm not going to ask
much for it, just enough to fix up the bus after its removal and the
shipping costs.

	It work fine, but during removal we decided to simply cut the belt
rather than deal with removing it, so a new belt would need to be
purchased.  Also, two of the hoses we cut cleanly with a razor blade, so
clamps would be needed to re-attach them, but that shouldn't be difficult.

	The vent fixture that mounts in the front ceiling is in excellent
condition with no cracks or tears.  The compressor runs well and the
fixture that mounts under the bus (I'm sorry, but I'm blanking on what it
is called) is not rusted and in good working order.

	So let me know if you're interested.  I'd love to relinquish it to
someone that would make use of it.

	Thanks,

	   Wade
