Subject: Re: DANGER: Use JACKSTANDS!

&gt;For times when you must raise the bus,
&gt;where is the safest place to put the stands?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;--
&gt;I always put 'em on the front axles, block the wheels AND stick a tire or
&gt;rim underthe
tranny or engine. Should the stand *still* slip, the rim should make a
fatal accident
merely a bad one.

Don't ask me what's holding the 65 singlecab up right now
I've jacked the 70 loaf up using bits of wood and a piece of tin to replace
a flat
in a torrent on a dirt road.
