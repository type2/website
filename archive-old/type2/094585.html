&gt;&gt;So that was the screen I heard rolling across the bottom of the tank
when I blew air up the line (gas drained) to see if it was clear?  It's
been running fine since I did that.  Doesn't the pipe help guard against
a large piece of crud from sliding over/into the opening and blocking
the flow to the external filter?&gt;&gt;


And is there one in the 78??
