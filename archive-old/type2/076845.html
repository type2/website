&gt; Hey list,

&gt; I noticed something strange today. When I depress the break pedal on my
&gt; bus with the engine idling, the RPM goes up slightly, and then fals back
&gt; down. When I release the break it does the same thing only more noticable.
&gt; What gives? Do I have a vac leak?

Perhaps, perhaps not.

If the idle drops back down while your foot is still on the brake pedal,
then you do not have a leak.  In order for the vacuum reservoir to work,
a small amount of air has to be fed to the manifold.

If the idle stays high, look for a leak.
