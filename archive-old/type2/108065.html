Subject: RE: [T2] top coating por 15

Anyone had success with anyother locally available product?

If it's already dry, you don't have much choice but to use their Tie Coat.
You can topcoat tacky POR-15 with your favorite primer and all should be
well.  Just don't try to do it too quickly...let the POR-15 dry about an
hour before topcoating.
