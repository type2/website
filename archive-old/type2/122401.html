Subject: Re: [T2] What holds pop top up on 1978 Westy ? How does tension
  work ?

&gt; Was this center bar under any kind of tension or spring, and is it a concern

&gt; think it was under
&gt; any tension when they removed and replaced it.

The bar is only a simple hollow tube.

&gt; I noticed there is some type of cable hooked up to both front arms at the
&gt; round hinge connectors.
&gt; It looks to me like the cable is pulled out as you lower it to help slow down
&gt; the roof as it lowers ?
&gt; 
&gt; How does the tension work on the front mechanism for the pop top and should I
&gt; be worried
&gt; about the painter replacing the center horizontal bar ?

Nothing should have to have been disassembled in order to remove the roof.
My technique is to use a rope to tie the upper and lower supports together
on both sides and then remove the top.
 
&gt; I don't want the top to fall on the kids when camping next summer !

No worries. The cable and spring in the side supports are a tensioned assist
mechanism. When the top is erected fully the supports pass thru 180 degrees
of angle then &quot;lock&quot; into place under the tension and weight of the roof.
