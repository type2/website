Subject: Re: [T2] once upon a pre-owned tuna can

Drive a Honda CRV when I want to get somewhere without any drama. Will 
do whatever maintenance the dealer and my mechanical ability will 
allow.

Drive a T2 when I want to have some fun. Will do as much maintenance 
and repair as I am able to do with the guidance of Bentley and Muir.

I've owned all kinds of vehicles and don't like working on something on 
which I must depend for my livelihood. Yet I like working on my own 
vehicles. If I can't afford to fix a difficult problem and it's in the 
scope of my ability, I'll figure out a way to do it myself. If a 
problem comes up that I can't solve, I'll save my dimes and go to the 
mechanic.

We made it home from Utah, safe and sound, but I think there's an oil 
leak coming from the main seal. I'll drop the engine in the spring. I 
remember what Junior Johnson said about working on a stock car. &quot;We 
done some unhookin' and some hookin' back up. Works fine now&quot;
