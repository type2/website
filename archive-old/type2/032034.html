my van is also missing the hardware that would seal this
gap up on the right side.  something on the left side is
bent and only one of the screws goes in.

this made me think. is there some kind of material like 
heat-shrink tubing for wires that has a much larger diameter
and was cheap that we could use? it seems like a maybe 4&quot;
long section would take care of volkswagens poor design.

After all we don't remove that often, whatever this mystery
material ends up being it probably isn't that expensive and
seems like it would seal it up well.

Any comments?

Proposals for what this mystery material might be?
Does heat shrink tubing come that big?

Just an idea.
