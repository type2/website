Subject: Leisure battery and charging

I have a question in regards to differences between a relay and an isolator.

What is the real difference?
I picked up an isolator which is rated at 95 amps if I remember right (?)
If I run a wire from (say 10 gauge or 12) from the regulator
to the isolator and then to the batteries will this 'trickle' charge
the acc battery or will this hit it with a high rate of charge?

Would it be preferable to use a 15 amp relay /isolator so it
doesn't pass as much current?

Any help with this would really be appreciated.

James


&gt;To answer your question about the load on the alternator,, If you use a
&gt;relay as an isolator, connected to the blue alternator wire, and connect
&gt;the aux battery to the main battery using wire no bigger than 10awg,, you
&gt;will not have any problems overloading your alternator or starter
&gt;problems...
