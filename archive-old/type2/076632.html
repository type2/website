Subject: Re: [T2]  locking engine hatch + FIRES NOT TRUE

And another note, aren't most of the first in VW busses caused by old, cracked
fuel lines?  If you change your lines, what else would cause a fire?  just
curious?

&gt; Hi John Here
&gt;  Sorry but any Fireman approaching a VW bus will not open the lid, so don't
&gt; worry about the lock. I lock mine because of my security system is back
&gt; there. I know when I am on the move my lid is not locked because I usually
&gt; check the oil before I move out. Firemen will approach and shoot foam or
&gt; other material through the engine vent intake. The lid keeps o2 from the
&gt; fire. Besides if its on fire I don't think you can go near that lid, too dame
&gt; hot!
