Subject: [T2] Events page back up!

Hah! I have finally got access to update the Events page, keep an eye as
it's MUCH better set out than the one before! No dates in just yet, but
ready to roll for 2001.

You might want to click the small text _at_ the bottom of the page to gain the
first of the 10 &quot;thou-shalt-nots&quot; _at_ a show/convoy pub meet, I am accepting
submissions to these commandments as quickly as you can think of them =)

BTW
Most of the posh effects I codes choked on the server so bear (beer ;)) with
me! £$%*ing Mac server!
