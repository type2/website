Subject: Re: diesel

I did this on a '63 bug many years ago because, get this, I was curious
after reading about it in the Muir book.  I had enough sense to move the car
away from the house, but that was about it.  I started pouring the diesel
down the carb throat while working the throttle so the engine wouldn't die.
(Hard to start when flooded with diesel)  The volume of white smoke
generated was truly incredible and I was stuck in the center of it, working
the throttle, pouring the diesel.  (I was truly committed to the process.)
When all was done, I couldn't tell any difference in the way the motor ran
and hadn't taken any compression reading for before or after comparison.
Thinking about doing it?  I'd advise otherwise.  If the motor is bad off,
diagnosis and repair is probably a better route than the diesel treatment.
Just my experience.

&gt; This is an old shadetree mechanic's way (described in Muir) to
&gt; decarbonize an engine (remove carbon deposits from the piston and head.
&gt; You don't put diesel in the tank, however!  You get the engine good
&gt; and warm, then pour the diesel into the carb while keeping the engine
&gt; running with the throttle.  The diesel doesn't vaporize, but remains as
&gt; drops that get hammered around in the cylinder and provide a cleaning
&gt; action.
&gt; 
&gt; As far as I'm concerned, water works as well and doesn't coat
&gt; everything with an oily mess!  In most cases, this procedure is a
&gt; last-ditch method anyway.

&gt;&gt; I read somewhere (know idea where, it was a while ago) that diesel is

&gt;&gt; and just
&gt;&gt; let the diesel run through and once you get past all the white smoke
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; bucking youd have a cleaner engine. Im not sure of the validity of
&gt;&gt; that, but
&gt;&gt; it shouldnt kill your engine, just anoy the hell outta you.
