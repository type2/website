Subject: '80 Vanagon whuffles itself to death

On the way home tonight, the Vanagon died.  Symptoms are an inability
to keep the engine running.  When trying to start, one or two
cylinders fire intermittently, but it whuffles out.  When it stops
after trying to start, it sometimes produces a very disturbing
screeching noise.  The whuffling sounds somewhere between non-closing
valves, and massive vacuum leak.  It ran fine coming back from lunch.

Right now, it's on the side of the road.  I figure on trying to figure
out what the deal is tomorrow, when I can see.  Ideas would be
appreciated, especially since I know nothing about fuel injection (I
haven't really figured out carburetors yet).

*sigh*  Looks like the '66 isn't going to get that new steering gear
this weekend after all....
