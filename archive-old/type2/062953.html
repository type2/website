Subject: Anybody Having Success Contacting BusBoys?

Is anybody else having difficulty reaching BusBoys, or am I being singled
out for special treatment?  They don't respond to Emails clearly titled
&quot;Placing an Order&quot; and their 800 phone number is constantly busy -- perhaps
off the hook?

I haven't tried fax yet - anybody had success that way?  I need to
actually interact with a human being there to get some price quotes from
them to make sure I want to pay their price before I give them my credit
card number.
