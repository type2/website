Hello,
        I've almost got my newly AVP rebuilt fuel-injected 2.0L in my
'78 Westy running, but am hitting some snags. I went to run it for 20
minutes at 2,000 RPM as per the Wilson book and had to really bring out
the idle air screw. Then even at the point of the screw almost popping
out, the engine would still only idle erratically around 2,000,
sometimes spiking up and never constant. So I thought &quot;Aha! Vacuum
leak!&quot; and sprayed carb cleaner to every possible leakage spot along the
intake manifold I could think of without RPM ever rising appreciably.
So, there's something obviously wrong and I am experiencing &quot;stuckness&quot;.
So I submit it to you, oh members of the Jedi Council. Any ideas? My
next recourse is to systematically check all the fuel injection system
components, which I am not looking forward to.
