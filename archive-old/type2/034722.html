Subject: Is This Rare?

'Morning All,
      Question. Near where I work ( Mclean, Va.) there is, and I'm guessing 
here, a '68 VW camper with the small pop up roof, like the '67 and earlier 
Westfalias. Did some early '68's come with this small pop up roof before they 
switched to the full length luggage rack/poptop? I've never seen a bay window 
bus before with this style roof. The thing has been sitting in a driveway for 
at least two years that I know of, and appears to be doing storage shed duty.
