&gt; &gt; Has anyone ever done a dual-diagonal brake system in a Bus? A dual-diagonal

&gt; Jim,
&gt;
&gt; I think this would be an excellent modification from a safety standpoint!
&gt; And I do not think it would be too difficult to accomplish from a plumbing
&gt; standpoint.  At the same time, I have this gut feeling that getting it to
&gt; work correctly would definitely be non-trivial.

Steve:
It's occurred to me, especially while lying under a Volvo trying to get mentally
prepared to lift the overdrive tranny into place! (Volvos have some kind of
double circuits on the front calipers so they have both front brake and one rear
on each of two circuits. They also have rear discs, so eliminate the need for the
rear proportioning valve.)
I'm more concerned with just getting the damn thing to work as good as it did
when it was new. Not really interested in reinventing the wheel. Oh, I'd
definitely consider putting disc brakes on the 69 double cab, but even that looks
like $1500 worth of work to me, and that car REALLY needs $1500 worth of
underside sheet metal repair first. (Or more practically: do $200 worth of repair
and save the $1300 for another pickup, a 71 or later model.)
So, diagonal brakes are not REAL HIGH UP on  my priority list.
