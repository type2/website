Subject: Re: [T2] rebuilt distributors???

Thanks for correcting me John. I didnt realize that was only for centrifugal
only distributors.

So, if I have a stock SVDA distributor and the curve is set for a stock
engine where should I set the timing? At idle or at high RPM? I have a '78
federal GE engine and now have it set at about 8 degrees at 900 RPM. Total
advance is around 32-33. Should I be more concerned about having total
advance at 42-45 degrees and not so much at what the timing at idle is? What
will be the benefits or consequence of having a higher advance at idle to
get to the 42-45 total advance?

Thanks for the info,

Jasan C.

&gt; this is NOT CORRECT. Optimal timing under certain conditions is 42-45 BTDC
&gt; (light load, high RPM). The &quot;rule&quot; of no more then 32 only applies to
&gt; centrifugal ONLY distributors, because they have no load-sensing
&gt; capabilities (vacuum advance), so you have to time for &quot;worst case&quot;, which
&gt; is full throttle (full load).
