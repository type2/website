Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel pressure

 
--Mark,

pick up a pressure gauge that reads to 40 or 50 psi and attach it to the stub on the fuel rail between #3/4 for the purpose. It has a 7mm screwed hex head bolt in the stub regularly.

crank it!

check the gauge, are you seeing close to 35psi and absolutely no lower than about 23?

yes: then you've got other problems.

no: perform tests per bentley on fuel pump and pressure regulator to determine which it is.

Later,

Billy

Recently it has become jump in for the first start of the day and crank for up to 20 seconds before the engine wants to fire.  After that first start it fires right away, as long as it hasn't sat
for more than a couple of hours.  So, I believe my problem to be either the fuel pump or the pressure regulator.
