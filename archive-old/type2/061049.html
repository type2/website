Subject: Still not driving the bus

I want to thank everyone who responded to my vacuum lines problem.  I got them all right now.  Now, my next problem.  In case some did not see the first, it involved a 2.0L Fuel Injected motor in my 78 bus.  The motor turns over real good but just won't start.  The battery is in good shape and has the required voltage to run the fuel injection system. I installed new plugs, cap, rotor, points, and coil.    I'm getting good spark all the way to the plugs.  It would seem that fuel isn't getting past the injectors.  I forgot to plug in the multigrounds to the block the first time and the fuel pump kept running while the ingition was off (kind of a good thing because it showed me a leak right at one injector).  I attached the  ground wires and it shut off. When I just turn on the ignition, the fuel pump isn't running.  Is it suppose too?  This might be the problem.  I sure would appreciate any help. Hope everyone had a good Thanksgiving.  Dennis Richardson, Altus, OK.

A special thanks to Karl who helped me out with another mystery.
