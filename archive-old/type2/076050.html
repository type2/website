Subject: Cosmoline

I worked at a Porsche/Audi dealership in the 70's and &quot;everything&quot; we got
was coated in cosmoline! Chances are that most if all Bay window busses got
the same treatment. Look in the door jams where the door stops are, chances
are that there will still be cosmoline there. We had a hell of  a time
cleaning it out of there in new car prep and usually left it since most
people didn't see it. Just my .02,
Britt
