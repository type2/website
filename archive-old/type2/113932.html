&gt;I just installed a trans with 4.57 R&amp;P and I think it is too tall gear set?
&gt;I normally drive in flatland Southern Ontario Canada.... but venture to
&gt;Virgina, PA.. for a few days a year.
&gt;Would a 4.86 R&amp;P be better than a 4.57 ?

If your 2.0 FI is losing power on the top end, the 4.57 will just reduce your top speed even more.  Otherwise, it would probably increase it as the 2.0 has a HP peak above 4,000rpm.  But how often, really do you drive that fast?  I don't think I would ever sustain 75mph in my bus, even if I could.


&gt;[#1]
&gt; 002 trans  with 091 bellhousing  using 210mm clutch pressure plate
&gt;5.375 -[43]ring and [8]pinion,    4th  0.82
&gt;This arrangement was topped out at 130kmph  or 80mph, downhill with a
&gt;tailwind on the day of least gravitation pull of the moon.

Sounds about right.

&gt;[#2]
&gt;I put in a Trans of unknown origin,, 002 trans with 002 bellhousing and
&gt;I just removed it,, and I know it has a 5.375 -[43]ring and [8]pinion,
&gt;I know it went down the road at 4000 rpm at 120km/hr  75mph
&gt;I don't really want to pull the gear cluster out to count 4th,,,,,

Highly likely that it was also the .82

&gt;I was *sure* that I was up about 200 rpm, and down about 5mph with this
&gt;trans compared to #1
&gt;I can't rely on that as I didn't have a tach then,
&gt;Although, this arrangement was topped out at 150kmph  or 90mph
&gt;*repeatativly* on the 401 hwy going east down into the Don River ravine

Don't know why you got more speed out of it but I think the ratios were in fact the same as #1.

&gt;[#3]
&gt;New Engine, 2.0 liter, hyd lifters
&gt;&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;              120kmph, 3800rpm &lt;my travelling speed! :-)
&gt;This seems to be top speed right at the moment,, flooored with a good
&gt;tailwind ,,, flat road,,, 120kmph

I would think it would go much faster than that.  Maybe your engine is running out of steam at 3800rpm.  I can't fathom a guess as to why.

&gt;I wondering,, is this tooooo tall gearing,,,,
&gt;Those with a 1978 bus would be comparable, I think,,

I think so too.  I don't see why it would be too tall.

&gt;shifter linkage length issues.... seems the 091 trans is longer  in the
&gt;shifter &quot;hockey stick&quot; area than the 002,
&gt;this means the shifter is  too far back in the early body,
&gt;i.e, when installing a late bay trans , 091, into a 1974 -002 trans body,
&gt;the shifter is pulled back to the rear tooo far.

I have posted about this on many occasions.  Finally, someone has backed me up.  :)

&gt;I remedied this by shifter adjustment, and a Straight stick shift, and
&gt;drilling a new &quot;dimple&quot; in the hockey stick, about 5mm closer to the trans
&gt;nose cone. this allows about 2mm clearance to remain between the shift
&gt;coupling, and the nose cone bushing when in 1st and 3rd

But what about the mounting issues?  Isn't it a tight squeeze in the rear mounting bracket?  Any NVH issues from this?
