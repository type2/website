Well it didn't happen of course, too many people leaving at too many
different times.

And unfortunately at the last minute I can't happen either, after working
like a dog till 10pm every night this week to get the '81 up for the trip,
turns out this morning I find out I have an unavoidable school function
Saturday and as I'd get down there late Saturday evening at best to stay for
a half a day Sunday, looks like it makes sense not to go.  And as I'm trying
for the first time in my life to exhibit a modicum of common sense, I hope
everyone else has a great time.

PS Dolan can now badger me all he want to since I had been riding him.
