I'll get zapped for saying/writing this, but...

Avoid any tire store that doesn't tighten your lug nuts with a torque
wrench, using factory specified torque values.  And you shouldn't have to
ask, it should be their standard procedure.

&gt;&gt;  the easiest way out of this dilemna is to go to almost
any garage and ask them to loosen your lug nuts , which
they will do for free when you bring your lug wrench and
retighten them by hand.  &lt;&lt;
