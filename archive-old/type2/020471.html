Subject: Re: [T2] emergency brake broke


Hey Nathan.  Know that on the 74, you don't need to remove the axle nut
to pop off the drum; you'll only need to remove the two bolts you see on
the surface of the drum after removing the tire.  

I had something similar happen to my bus.  There's a anchor pin on a
lever attached to one of the brake shoes; if memory serves me right the
emergency brake cable attaches to that lever.  (I think it serves as a
sort of pivot point for the mechanism between the tensioned cable and
the brake shoe.)  Anyway, on some brake shoes this pin was held in with
a horseshoe clip, which if it works its way off can allow the anchor pin
drop into the drum.  This happened to the right-rear wheel on my van,
and the pin got wedged in there enough somehow to lock it up solid (just
before that it sounded like loose change clanking around in a can).  

Even still, it could be one of a a few things (broken spring, broken
pin, etc.).  Best way to know is to open it up.

It sounded like something horrible happened to the rear wheels, but it

still driving fine.
