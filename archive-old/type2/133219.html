&gt; Know that if the motor never sees dirty oil and is maintained properly, you

gotta agree 100% with the doc here, a very good quality motor oil and a
regular drain and filter per inspection (or slightly early if you can't
inspect)

in my case, and in mine alone I find I can get a comfortable 5k miles on
my 2liter engine with a filter change and Mobil 1 synthetic motor oil.
might be able to get a little more or even a lot more mileage or time, but
I won't exceed 6months or 5k and she has served me well and looks to
continue doing so.  this of course is based on my normal driving habits, I
deviate and I check more often. or fall into the PM mode and just change
it early. Gas filter with oil filter,  air filter every other change and
tranny oil every third change.  keeps me baby happy  322k miles and
counting

never bother with additives or other stuff, just top quality products and
regular PM
