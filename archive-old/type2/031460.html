&gt; I do have a Ford solenoid switch at my starter solenoid, so I was really 
&gt; surprised to see this 'hot start' problem today, in 35 degree weather (USA).

I have wired in a &quot;direct&quot; switch in the rear engine compartmen, directly
from battery to hot side of starter, direct shot, has always cranked, so
far no matter what the column switch does
