&gt;HI All,  Found out something interesting about the wiring this morning
&gt;on one of my bugs.  Yeah, I know it's not a type 2, but I think everyone
&gt;will be interested in this.  I was, and still am, having the hot Generator
&gt;problem.  Apparently, if the generator is hot it means that the current
&gt;is getting lost somewhere, so the Generator has to 'work' harder to keep
&gt;up the voltage. 

Actually, the generator is getting hot from all the combustion going on in
there... ;)
