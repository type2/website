&gt; Well, I managed to crack a pickle fork :( I have thrown in the towel
&gt; for the day. Tomorrow I will get John's tie rod separator and have a

It's takes 10-20 seconds to pop them out without any damage whatsoever.

Not really. It's a ball-joint system and has a tapered fit which is why it's
hard to get out of there.
