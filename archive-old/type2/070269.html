Subject: Yet another Newbie - with a 1971 Westy

Hello to All,

Just acquired a white 1971 Westy (or it acquired me :-)).  My wife, 
Shelley, and I bought it from the second owner who had owned it for 
the last 13 years.

As far as I can tell the interior is all original (excepting the 
window cutains) and in beautiful condition. The engine was re-built about 4,500 
miles ago by the same VW dealership that has maintained the bus for 
the PO over the last 13 years (her bill, which she gave us, was 
$1,700).  The bus has four new Michlein (sp?) tires and new brakes 
and hydraulic hoses.

The canvas pop-up is in reasonable condition but I have it slated for 
replacement -- any suggestions as to a source for the canvas?  I'm 
looking for good quality at a reasonable price, not necessarily the 
cheapest.

Also, the window gaskets are pretty well cooked -- don't seem to leak 
(it does rain here in western Washington!) but they look awful.  I 
see most of you recommend West Coast Metric or Bus Boys.

Now the bad part -- as wonderful as the interior is and as great as 
the bus runs the body isn't too great.  It isn't horrible -- it has 
the original white paint job and no major dings, dents or bumps but I 
do have rust :-{ on the rocker panels (pretty bad) and on the body in 
a couple of areas (left rear side and right rear side, 'bout 5-6&quot; in 
diameter) and the PO hit a dog at the right front (just below the 
headlight) which pushed in the front.  Sooooooo -- how do I deal with 
the rust (I want to restore the bus and keep it quite awhile) and is 
anyone familiar with a reputable body shop (oxymoron?!?) north (or 
in, if must be) of Seattle?

One more thing.  I just read an article by Rich Kimball about the 
1973 Type2.  In this article the author states &quot;On the 1968 through 
1972 models, the front turn signals were located below and a liitle outside
the headlights, just above the front bumper.  For 1973, the front turn signals
were moved higher on the front body panel ...&quot;  I have a wrap around 
front bumper with the rubber-covered built-in step under the doors.  
And my turn signals are mounted high on the front panel at either end 
of the front air intake grill.  Is the article wrong or do I have a 
diferent kinda bus or what?  The photos in the article are of a 
Westfalia.

I am thoroughly enjoying the list and am picking up lots of great 
info.  And thanks in advance for putting up with yet another newbie 
:-)

Thanks to All,
Les Lampman
