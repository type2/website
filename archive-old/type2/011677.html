Hey there Volks,

Thats why I avoid the issue of where to &quot;hide&quot; my spare. The main set
is on one keyring. Two keys (doors/ignition + engine hatch) a la
ZZtop, complete with logo, on one ring. This will also get rid of the
extra weight of all my other keys on the ignition switch. The spares
are on the keyring w/ my housekeys (and other keys).

This also allows me to keep the bus running, while using my spare set
to unlock the rear hatch when necessary. Then there is the &quot;extra&quot;
spare that I keep in my wallet 8-)
