Subject: Re: Good AND inexpensive tire pump, where to find?

&gt;&gt; If you want to skimp, then just buy 2 of these. The second
&gt;&gt;one adds  insurance against the first one breaking, as one
&gt;&gt;of our folks pointed 
&gt;
&gt;So what ever happened to St Muirs super, screw into the
&gt;spark plug pump anybody know?  I think he detailed it as
&gt;some sort of impulse thing seperated from the actual
&gt;cylinder charge but why not use one engine cylinder itself
&gt;instead, not a bad idea as disabling gas to one cylinder a
&gt;joke with FI.  One VW cylinder pumping is more than anyone
&gt;would ever need along with a good piece of hose, in fact
&gt;maybe worth a roll your own try using the remains of a $15
&gt;compression tester combined to a quick disconnect and then a
&gt;piece of air hose.  Thoughts anyone?  This is academic for a
&gt;diesel owner unfortunately.

&gt;Y'know, I've seen several posts which are variations on this 
theme, but it occurs to me that a hose attached to a spark 
plug hole would not only reap the benefits of a cylinder's 
compression, but its SUCTION as well!  I'm picturing a tire, 
inhaling and exhaling as per a bad *cid trip I once took!  
Don't do it! (now If you could only hook up to the exhaust 
valve!, but I think somebody posted about just snarfin' off 
the exhaust pipe!)
