Subject: Re: missing at highway speeds Have similair problem

I'am worried about a similiar problem.  My 77 transporter cuts of for days.
Then response to my attempts
to eliminate possible causes by running for days . Then cuts out again. This
has happened 4 times . I'am also feeling quite insecure. The first time 4 or
5 months ago I cleaned and tightened all the grounds. After 2 days of
cleaning and fiddling she suddenly started and ran the 4 or 5 months with no
problem. Two weeks ago she wouldn't start one morning. Would crank, but not
start. would fire for 2 or 3 secounds and they die. New coil
cleaned all the grounds again, disconnected cold start valve leads. And she
started up and ran for 3 or 4 days
maybe 10 to 15 start ups. But this time she wouldn't idle smoothly
immediately , had to rev her for a while  before she'd smooth out and not
die on me.  But she ran for a couple of days maybe 8 to 12 starts with
initial rough idle then run fine . Then again she wouldn't start. Cleaned
all air hoses and vacuum tubes. Air sensor  resistance with in bounds,
tempeture sensor resistance 1800 instead of 2500 ordered new one. Can't do
any test that requires the engine to be running or warm etc. I'am baffled.
Do you think the resistor ballast or the fuel pump relays (are they the same
as the double relay?) might be the source of this INTERMITTENT problem .?
