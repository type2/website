Subject: windshield chip repairs

I have a couple tiny chips in my windshield. Are those
$10 spot fixes that glass shops offer a good deal? I'd
like to do something before the freeze/thaw conditions
spreads a big crack.

I had a chip fixed on my MbZ and it's held up through
two winters. (It's also almost invisible.)

But the shop makes you sign an &quot;ungarantee&quot; that says
it is possible the repair process will destroy your
window or fail to stop the crack from spreading. I'd
hate to see my 33-year-old windshreen crumble before
my eyes.
