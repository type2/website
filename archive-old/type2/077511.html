Subject: Re: [T2] There were NEVER any factory ragtop buses

I think you should double your dosage!!         Why do they call a VW truck 
a single cab? A Crew Cab a Double cab? Because it is VW lingo not 
because.....&quot;the rest of the antique auto hobby and the general population 
will think you're talking about a convertible?&quot;.........we have our own 
language and if you don't get it now (especially with all the VWs you have) 
you'll never get it!!!!  Remember &quot;it's a Volkswagen not a car&quot;.

That's my little rant

&gt;forehead started to throb again.
&gt;
&gt;I've ranted about this before, but I can never figure out why the VW hobby 
&gt;has misappropriated the term &quot;ragtop&quot;.  If you look in a dictionary, a 
&gt;&quot;ragtop&quot; is a
&gt;_convertible, a car with a folding top, usually of fabric (thus 
&gt;&quot;rag&quot;).  Oxford English dictionary has one entry for &quot;ragtop&quot;: &quot;U.S. 
&gt;slang, a convertible car with a soft
&gt;hood.&quot;  Earliest reference cited is 1955.  (As an aside, the OED's 
&gt;etymology gives an argument for calling a single/doublecab with tilt and 
&gt;bows a &quot;ragtop&quot;.)
&gt;
&gt;I tend to blame the emergence of &quot;ragtop&quot; meaning &quot;VW with fabric sunroof&quot; 
&gt;on the known eloquence of the VW magazine writers/editors, who are still 
&gt;struggling
&gt;with the correct spelling of &quot;cool&quot;.  Yes, a means of distinguishing 
&gt;between the earlier fabric sunroof models and the later sliding steel 
&gt;sunroof models is needed, but
&gt;why the hell call them ragtops when the rest of the antique auto hobby and 
&gt;the general population will think you're talking about a convertible?
&gt;
&gt;Could it be ... illiteracy?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Ragtops are convertibles, and although I've seen some custom buses without 
&gt;a roof, I've never seen a ragtop bus.
