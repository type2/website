Subject: Re: [T2] Windshield - hammer - teardrops!

&gt; Folks, let's not get paranoid about &quot;hitting&quot; the glass! I've seen at
least 60
&gt; Bus windshields installed(10 were mine!) by pro installers, and to a man,
they
&gt; all hit the glass, and not a light tap.

Seems like I have a story for every procedure on the list. I'm on my third
windshield in eight years. The first, the result of a Montana rockchip. I
had it replaced at one of those chains, WindSheilds America. I think they're
Safelite now. After replacement I had leakage. Took it back, they &quot;sealed&quot;
it, black silicone goop all over the place, still leaked. So, I bought a WCM
seal and decided to &quot;do it right&quot; by doing it myself. Everything went fine,
but it wouldn't quite fit. I had observed the glass guys using some sort of
hammer, probably a special glass installers hammer. So I got a hammer,
regular old claw hammer. Well you know what happened, windshield number two.
This was later broken by an improper installation of &quot;The Club&quot;. Don't ask.
Luckily when I took the Bus to Windshields America in Portland I was somehow
able to convince the manager that my previous glass was installed
incorrectly. It probably helped that he was from the same town in Montana.
Now we're coming to my point. He told me that all replacement glass is not
created equal. The previous $69.95 or whatever it was cheap windsheild
probably wasn't cut to exact size, hence no fit. The guy actually replaced
for free the &quot;no name&quot; windshield with a nice piece of PPG glass. Great fit.
He did use some sort of sealant. No leaks. That's all I care about.
