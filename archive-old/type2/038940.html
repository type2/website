Subject: Fuel Line Question

Greetings,

I am in the process of changing the fuel line in my '79 FI Westy.  My
question concerns the short length of 1/2&quot; fuel line that runs between the
filter and the fuel pump.  I can't find this diameter hose at any of my
FLAPS.  They all have regular fuel line, but not stuff rated for high
pressure.  Question: Do I really need &quot;high pressure&quot; fuel line in front of
the fuel pump.  I understand needing it after the pump and have used it on
all other sections.  I've searched the archives and got contradicting
information.

TIA
