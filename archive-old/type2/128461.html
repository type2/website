Subject: Re: [T2] window screens

Nylon home screen flip over--off center locks.
Ace is the place is where you can locate them--


 
[T2] window screens 
Now that I'm Sasser free, I can finally ask: is there a trick to keeping
the side window screens from falling out all of the time?!?!? The one in
the sliding door is the culprit, really, for obvious reasons. I've tried
wedging paper into the edges, but they eventually fail. Is there some
kind of retaining system that has worked for any of you?
