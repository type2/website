Kevin:

If you have any questions about what you are hearing, ask what the compression for
each of the cylinders is.  I don't think anyone should be recommending $2800 bucks
worth of work without being able to tell you that.  If nobody there seems to know,
I would suggest you look elsewhere.  However, even if you feel comfortable with
the answers you are getting and the rep of the shop, you should consider some
other options.

Being close in mechanical ability to what you describe (somewhat beyond Muir but
clearly learning as I go), let me suggest that you consider finding a decent
running (used) engine and swap them out:   you'll learn alot, save some bucks for
the pull and installation, and have your old engine to rebuild.  As a practical
matter, if you need to send it to a machine shop (see your post with the word
&quot;camshaft&quot;)  your probably going to run over one week.

My first and only (top-end) rebuild took most of a winter, but I learned lots as I
worked through it.

As always, YMMV.  Good luck.

&gt; Well, I got really bad news today from my local VW mechanic.  My '76 FI is
&gt; need of an overhaul.  I haven't talked to them in person, just over the phone
&gt; with lots of background noise.  All I got was words like valves, block,
&gt; camshaft, pistons, compartment seal....all for $2800.
