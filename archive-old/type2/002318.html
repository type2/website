Regarding Vanagon clutch replacement:

Justin, it is quite possible, easily.  Probably easier in fact for this
drop, though I stress droping both is only about a 2 hour affair anyway, the
way I always go.  To drop only the tranny you basically only need a way to
support the front of the engine.  Best way is a piece of all thread rod from
a hardware store (3/8&quot; I think) bent into a hook, with about a foot then a
1&quot; hook or L portion.  Then a 4 foot section of 2x4, couple of wahers and a
nut.  You put the hook through the front upper hole in the engine case most
adjacent the flywheel, run up through the 2x4 which has a hole and is front
to back across the engine compartment, washer and nut.  Then you remove all
the inboard CV bolts, and can wire the driveshafts up out of the way (nicer
to remove but hard to get to the outer bolts) remove the wires from the
starter (disconnect battery first off), pull the starter (1 nut, 1 through
bolt through top right of case), pull the clutch cylinder off its bracket (2
very tough to get at 13mm head bolts/nuts, use the VW stubby factory tool
kit wrench and a 1/4&quot; drive driver, wobble extensions, whatever) remove the
bracket holding the clutch line to the side of the tranny.  Pop the socket
off the ball on the clutch shaft with a big screwdriver and tuck the entire
cylinder up on the left trailing arm out of the way without breaking any
hydraulic connection.  The slave is hard to bleed without a MityVac pump or
the like ($20 at Walmart) but is generally best left undisturbed if the
clutch is working well and it isn't leaking badly/obviously.  You should
bleed it by pumping with a MityVan and pumping like a brake bleed but best
not to disconnect lines unless you must.  Disconnect ground strap front of
tranny.  Support wiht a jack/board under center/rear of tranny, have the all
thread thing with the nut about 1.25&quot; over the 2X4, thentake the 4 bolts out
of the front of the tranny mount.  Lower the floor jack carefully to tilt it
down a bit, and see if things will look like they will clear.  If so bring
the nut on the all thread in contact if not, remove the other 3 tranny to
engine fasteners (through bolt on top left, 2 nuts on bottom on studs) then
making sure everything is clear (like the stuff I've forgot) slide her back
off.  If needed loosen the bolt on the all thread to drop the engine a bit
more.  You can tilt the engine back pretty good but don't go farther than
you need to just clear the tranny front below the frame.  When you pull it
back and off you can then drop, roll forward, drop, roll, etc.  WATCH
carefully the initial forward though, a brake line runs directly in front of
the tranny and is easy to catch.  Oh forgot about the shift lever, for that
you pull the boot forward if still present where the support bracket is in
the tranny, you will see like a 13-15mm set of flats on the pin that goes
into the shift rod (might have to shove the rod forward, I guess into 2 or
4) there is a 17 or 19 mm nut on the exposed side of the support pin.  hold
the flats, remove the nut then shove the pin forward into the forward rod,
it should then clear the bracket on the tranny (the tranny case itself
actually) then remove the pin, and gently tuck the rod out of the way (it
will just catch on the hand brake cable on that side, or wire it to the
trailing arm).

Oh needless to say rear end of the van must be VERY high and well supported,
like at least on a set of high truck ramps, though 2 high solid jack stands
are better.  You really run into trouble having enough room for the tranny
on a jack to roll out of under the engine.  You may have to crank the engine
back up some, or set the tranny off on the pavement on a piece of cardboard
and pull it out.  Of course you might not want to move it soo far if just
doing a clutch.  BTW Bus Depot, Sachs set about $120, pretty much
unbeatable.  You need the clutch, 6 new bolts doesn't hurt, a can of brake
cleaner for the flywheel, and most importantly a cheapy plastic clutch
alignment tool.  And of course whatever else....  Also a great time to clean
and repack CV's and replace boots all round.  Make a whole weekend of it.
