Subject: Re: [T2] MAPP gas

Barry said:

 &gt; I want to buy a 16oz tank of MAPP gas.  I want to use it to heat frozen 
nuts
 &gt; and bolts/screws so they can be loosened.  Some of these bolts are 
studs
 &gt; that go into aluminum heads and case.  No, I dont plan to use it on
 &gt; magnesium cases!!

 &gt; Any comments??

NO problem using it but I've had better luck freezing nuts than heating them 
for removal.

Richard, I totally agree!!

I'm in the Northeast, and it's so cold outside,

I'll bet I can freeze my nuts off just by going outside without a coat!!!
