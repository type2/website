Subject: [T2] Re: [VB] Stalling at deceleration

and the winner is...........Little Johnny Yust of Knoxville, TN. The bus was
still pretty warn when I got John's post so I went out to the bus, grabbed
the 17 and put it on the solenoid and damn if it was not loose! I snugged it
up and made plans to use the whole family as test subjects to see if this
truly solved the problem. Loaded up the bus with car seats, kids, wife tools
and went to dinner. No probs at all.

Thanks to all who responded!!!!!!!!!!!

Morale of the story is just because I checked it once and thought it was
right does not mean it was right :)
