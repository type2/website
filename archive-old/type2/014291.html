Subject: regasket kits for Solex 32/34pdsit carbs, the best one?

Hello List,

I have yet another question. The 32/34pdsit
carburators that are one it have set for awhile and I
am thinking about regasketing them. I know that many
dealers sell the gasket kits for this type of
carburator settup. What is the best source for good
quality gasket kits? Some kits must be better than
others, right? If any one has had luck with a
piticular regasket kit for your dual solex carbs,
please let me know what worked for you. I would really
appreciate it. Thanks!
