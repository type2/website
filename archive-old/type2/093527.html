&gt;&gt;hey list, just installed dual 34 PDSIT's on 74 single cab with 1700 CB 
&gt;&gt;engine.  Runs very smooth except it doesn't accelerate as rapidly after 
&gt;&gt;about 2000 rpm as it did with the dual webers.  I have a 2 month old SVDA 
&gt;&gt;distributor on it from aircooled_dot_net and timing is set at 7.5 BTDC.  I 
&gt;&gt;have noticed that one accelerator pump only has about half the stroke of 
&gt;&gt;the other one.  Would that cause the rather slow acceleration?

&gt;Why don't you fix it and see?
