Subject: Re: Car jack or axl stand

&gt; 
&gt; Clarification requested:
&gt; 
&gt; Use a jack stand ---  car jack? or &quot;axl&quot; stand?  ;-)  I assume you mean
&gt; axl stand.  
&gt; 
&gt; For me, I've had a personal tragedy re: a friend whose van (GMC
&gt; behemoth) fell on him, killing him.  Since then, the only time I'll go
&gt; under a car is... almost never...  When I do go under a car, I first use
&gt; the emergency/car jack, then I support it with $15.00 pair ($15.00 for
&gt; both) of 3-ton stands  that I think I bought from a Costco or Price
&gt; Club.  Hopefully three stands are better than one :)
&gt; 
&gt; Yup, sometimes I think _I'm_ paranoid, but then I remember my friend who
&gt; died trying to save exactly $8 dollars by doing an oil change himself.
&gt; 
&gt; Just something to think about...
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
The same thing happened to my grandfather, but this was back in the '50s
and he was under a Cadillace ('50s Caddy -- how many tons???).  Luckily
my dad was there to get help and my grandfather lived.  Kind of
surprising that my gf was under there given he was a Westinghouse
engineer.  He probably should have known better, tho I confess to
getting under the car every now and then w/ just a jack.  Amazing to
think that $15 can save your life.  I think I'll go buy some jackstands.
