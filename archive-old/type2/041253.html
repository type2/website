&gt; I just put a dip stick vdo oil temp sensor in my 78 westy and still have the 
&gt; original tin. My temps on the highway (crusing at 65) are running around 260 
&gt; and crank all the way up to 275 extended mountain climbs. Does this indicate 
&gt; something is wrong with my cooling system? if so where to start looking? or 
&gt; just variances in different gauges/sensors?

maybe variances, maybe you are running hot, is all the tin in place, are
the seals all there and tight, is your oil presure staying up, what weight
oil are you using,    the old grab the dipstick system is good for
comparison,
in otherwords can you grab and hold the dipstick in your bare hands after
driving, you should just be able to do that.

I am basing everything on a sump sender so I am not sure how much
difference there would be on a dipstick sender

I have not heard of a van running at 275 for extended times and being
considered normal,  that appears to be too hot by my feeling, I pull over
and stop if mine hits 250 even on the hottest day.

YMMV
