*sigh* i miss the west coast. i never noticed how prevalant veedubs are 
there till i moved to the east coast...ever since i bought my ghia, vws seem 
to be slowly multiplying in the barracks parking lots, and i keep tabs on 
all of them. im the only one with a bus though. other than that, vws are 
pretty much non existant here...then i go visit my folks in tri cities, and 
puyallup, and you cant leave the house without gettin run over by a whole 
herd of the things...hmmm, i think im on the wrong coast

&gt;
&gt;When no other vehicles on the block will start and go, the VW Type 2s 
&gt;ALWAYS
&gt;get going.  And then their owners/drivers do what they can to help their
&gt;unfortunate neighbors on their respective ways.  And it's amazing how many
&gt;folks can squeeze into a Type 2 for a neighborly ride to the FLAPS for new
&gt;batteries, chains, starting fluid, etc.
