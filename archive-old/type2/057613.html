Subject: Server Trouble...

Somebody sez:

&gt;No one has
&gt;let me know how to contact Das Bulli or other suppliers.

&gt;Again, if anyone has any ideas about how to save my bus, _PLEASE_
&gt;send me some advice.

It may not be the spirit, it may just be the weakness of the flesh. Half of
the azaccess DNS are down, and on top of that one name server for THOSE
(something called verio_dot_net) is down as well. We seem to be blocked from
most of the net (and they from us).

We're hoping it will all come back soon because it's not as if we haven't
bitched about it...findmail_dot_com seems to be working and it's possible to
post from there if that helps.
