Subject: Re: [T2] Clutchdisk,Jackand Stands, needed for engine swap in bay area


&gt;  I'd like to throw in a
&gt; decent clutch disk while i'm at it. the current one
&gt; has about 20,000 miles on it,and probably had rear
&gt; seal oil leakage. Considering a partially &quot;used&quot; one.I
&gt; don't recall the size of the clutch just now.

Your 72 should have a 210mm clutch.
Look at the clutch cover [pressure plate], around it should be stamped '210' and
probably Sachs.
