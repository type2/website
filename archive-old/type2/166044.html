I always do it with my wheels on.. never had to take them off to bleed 
the brakes.

You have the method right.  Just make sure that you open the bleeder 
while they're holding pressure on the pedal and you close it before they 
lift it back up.  Pretty straightforward.  Make sure you do NOT use 
brake fluid that has been opened already.  Once you open it, you can 
only store it for about a month and then it's trash as it absorbs water 
out of the air.

&gt; Also I need to monitor the brake fluid reservoir carefully as I could allow
&gt; air into the system.

That is true.  Do some pumps, then check the level.  Do some more pumps, 
check it again.

&gt; So, why do you need the wheel on the vehicle again?

so you don't have to take it off in the first place?

&gt; I also intend to use a clear hose to be able to see the fluid for air or
&gt; change in color for the old fluid.

that, or look at the fluid flowing into your bleeder bottle as an 
indicator.  You'll probably have to go through an entire bottle of brake 
fluid... the big one (I think it's a liter or so).
