Hey Volks!
Just checking in with some questions for the great oracle of type II. First
and foremost, I'm looking for the cab floormat for my '71 Westy.
Apparently, a reproduction of the original is not made (according to
WolfsburgWest) and I was wondering if anybody had a line on a quality repro
for the rubber, or, a good condition used one? Also, I want to thank Karl
Von Salzen for scoring me the knobs,thanks Karl! Now, how to install them
without breaking the little plastic thingies. Stop me if I get too
technical 8^) One last thing, somebody mentioned type II_dot_com hats a few
days ago, how do I get one? have a great weekend everyone!
