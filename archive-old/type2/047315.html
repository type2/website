Subject: [T2] NC paint and body recommendations

Hi,
  I was in a small fender bender a couple of months ago, and my front side
is now dented in.  I had repainted my bus and had body work done about 2
years ago, so she was looking good, but the guy who did the work before has
left the business.  Can anyone recommend a paint and body place in NC,
preferably around the Raleigh/Durham area?
Thanks,
Dallas
