Subject: [T2] replacment started bush install??? help

Dr. Leukas Heukamp wrote-
&gt;&gt;A couple of days ago I posted a mail asking for suggestions on how to pull
&gt;&gt;out the old starter bushing to install a new one with my replacment starter.
&gt;&gt;My email failed so I didi not get any replies.
&gt;&gt;I the mean time I have found an artikle in the library on that .
&gt;&gt;but what happens if you do not change the bush?

measure the shaft and the bushing. decide how much life is left in yours.
( compare with the new bushing ). i prefer to screw a tap into it, then
a bolt will turn / remove it easily. a sloppy bushing will cause problems
with the flywheel engagement and the starter armature shorting out.
