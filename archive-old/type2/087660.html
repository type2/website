Subject: re:'78 Bus FI troubleshooting - only runs on cold-start after engine swap - The Bus Runs!!

Hi All.

Thanks so much to everyone who replied. Special thanks to Steve Dolan. Steve identified the exact =
wire that I had cut and not reconnected. Special thanks also to Rob who sent the a message with =
the description of how the juice gets to the double relay. I not only got the bus running, but I =
understand how it wasn't running. The list is amazing!

Turns out that the + from the coil (or in my case the MSD) goes through a black wire to a fuse =
that runs the heater fan. Before it gets through the fuse though, it junctions with another wire =
in the fuse holder. That other wire is what sends the + signal to the double relay to run the =
injection system. Its goofy how the fuse holder is a junction also, but thats how VW did it.

Anyway, the bus is running very nicely. A couple of issues remain. Oil pressure at idle is a =
little lower than I would like, but still within spec AFAIK - 12-15 psi _at_ 210 degrees oil temp. =
Also there is an oil leak somewhere. This is a little disappointing since I wanted a new engine =
that would have 4 working cylinders (unlike the old one) and that also would not leak (unlike the =
old one). I will investigate in the next day or two and see if the oil leak is coming from the =
strainer, the sump plate, behind the flywheel (bad), or seeping through the case halfs (very bad). =

I'll write up all my mistakes as well as my AVP experience soon and send it on up to you.

Thanks again,

Mark
