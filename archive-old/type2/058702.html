Subject: Step 4 on busted bus not working
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I am not sure if this is an approp. post for the list, but I have not been
able to get the &quot;step 3&quot; on busted bus to work ... getting DIG ERROR.  I
have not seen other posts about it so I thought maybe it was just me?????
This has been the case for me since I became a member of the list several
weeks ago ... I notice the site in general is under a bit of construction,
so I thought that might be it????  I am a newbie to the VW world and I have
a lot of the kinds of questions that have probably been asked a million
times if I can get access to the info.
