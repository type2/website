Subject: WTB..Vanagon 80-83 propane tank

Title says it gang....I'm in need of a Westy propane under body tank
complete with valves (hose optional, but could use it too) for my 80
Westie project bus &quot;Bluenose&quot;

It goes to paint this week...

If anyone knows about availability of the Boogie Woogie Gazelle cloth
anywhere, I'm in need of a few yards to rework the z-bed, rear cushion
and front seats...I &quot;think&quot; that's gonna be my last obstacle to clear
before hitting the road this summer...
