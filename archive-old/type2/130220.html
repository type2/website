Subject: Re: [T2] VIN swap (was Jay Leno)

In certain of the beach communities here -- Ocean Beach, Mission Beach, 
and so on -- buses number around five or so per city block. They are 
thick here. I live in an area of lower bus density, but even so there 
are a splitty and a '78 on my two-block street. The '78 was hit from 
behind at one point, smashing up the rear quarter panel. It was 
repaired and in new paint in a week's time.

But except for restored splitties and really late Vanagons (especially 
Syncros), buses are NOT associated with rapid upward social mobility 
here.
