Subject: At what point are you addicted?

hey now,

at what point are you addicted when it comes to vws? when you get your
second one? 5th one? 12th? or, *gasp* does it happen with your first one?
do i need help? will i survive fuel injection? should i have stayed with
carbs? when should i switch to 10w30? 2.0L? 1.8L? Gas leaks? changing
cv joints? dropping valve seats? timing? dwell? ohmygodithinkineedavwfixnow!

will rumba the '74 Retrowestie get along with the newer FI '77 Westy? will
they be jealous? should i keep them apart?


don't mind me, just frolicking on a friday!

jonathan :-) :-) :-)
