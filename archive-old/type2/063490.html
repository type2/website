Subject: oil Filters

        Jonathan, Volks,
        I've successfully used Fram, Bosch, Wix, Lee, Penzoil and probably
others on a Rabbit, Golf (II) and a 914. About 350,000 miles collectivly,
which suggests about 100 filters. No explosions. My '70 hasn't got a spin-on 
and my Corrado uses a canister. I always liked the nice orange color of 
Frams, and they have recieved high marks from 'european car' and that
kind of organization.
        WIX uses cut-open examples of thier and other filters as a
sales tactic, but you can't see how good the filter medium (paper)
really is with your eye. I've heard that Fram's filtering ability
is better than average.
        AC and WIX, for two, encorporate spring-loaded relief valves
in their filters to allow dirty oil to bypass the filter if
the filter becomes blocked. With frequent oil changes, and
a low-dust environment, I can't see how this becomes an issue.
        Fram do not have the built-in relief.
        I've never had problems with any of the above, and would
probably buy Fram if I had to go buy a filter tomorrow.

        Happy Motoring!

        Bill
