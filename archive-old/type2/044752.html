&gt; Matt -
&gt; 
&gt; On the thermostat note:  my recent experience is that different ranges might
&gt; possibly mean different connections.  I've a type 4/1980 Westy.  I went to
&gt; repl the thermostat _at_ a local VW shop.  They gave me the wrong one because:
&gt; 1) it was a lower range (possibly 65-70, I don't recall exactly; mine is
&gt; 85-90, I think) &amp; 2) the means of attaching the cable were different.  My
&gt; old one had a connector nipple (?) threaded on the outside, &amp; the thermostat
&gt; cable side connector screwed down over this.  The new/wrong one had inside
&gt; threads on the connector, indicating the cable had &quot;outside&quot; threads.  I
&gt; imagine, however, that for every thermostat, there's a cable.

Yes, but I have found that on the inside threaded ones (generally for bug
engines) you can unscrew the post from the body of the thermostat and lo and
behold, it will now fit the outside thread on a type IV cable.
