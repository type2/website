No. I'm only saying if your distributor is good you'll see most of the
benefit from the CDI.

Speaking of Mallory, I installed a non-VW unit into another car two nights
ago. This was a unilite with vacuum can and it was way too tall to fit this
car. It was sent back to Mallory at their request and they swapped it for a
smaller bodied version, sourced a hard to find low profile cap from their
warehouse, spun up the distributor on the tester and gave us the curve. They
did this all for $65. Quite amazing service...
