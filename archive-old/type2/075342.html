&gt; This is how I've broken in street engines for years.  Vanagon motor has

&gt;
&gt; The paragraph:
&gt;
&gt; &quot;An engine's initial run should be used to bring oil and coolant (air,
&gt; oil, and/or water) up to operating temperature only, with little or no
&gt; load, then shut down and allowed to cool to ambient temperature.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; is your 2000/20.  Beds the cam and lifters. The rest of it is road stuff
&gt; and the usual recommendation. Moderate speeds, no lugging, occasional
&gt; short bursts of full throttle acceleration, CHANGE OIL.  typical
&gt; break-in stuff...
&gt;
&gt; The BMEP comments are fluff to stretch the article. (Getting paid by the
&gt; word?)  The meat is in the last few paragraphs.

I'm probably a bit less charitable than you.  Seems to me that the BMEP
stuff is BS to impress the reader.  It is impressive if you don't know
anything about BMEP and how it is used, but the whole premise falls apart
if you've ever studied it.  I try to resist the urge to do this sort of
thing, as there always seems to be one or two people around who can see
through this approach.  As Robin Williams said in one of his routines:
&quot;That's not writing, that's just typing!&quot;
