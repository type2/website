Subject: Dixie Bus Gathering Report and Pix (Very Long)

WhooooooHoooooooo!
Now that was a genuine throwdown.  I gotta believe a good time was had by
all.

Pictures are located here if you choose not to read my person by person
report.

We had a 50/50 raffle that gathered $70 dollars.  Impressive to me on
account we only had 15 buses.  Thank you Casey for helping.  We have a check
to donate to the type2 list for $35.  I also received a few donations for my
chili escapade, and I am donating this to the Fullmoonbus club, a check in
the amount of $35 to the moonies.  Snoopy just tell me where to send it.

I want to thank everyone for making this another successful event.  We had
absolutely no complaints from the nearby campers.  They must have enjoyed
John and Terrys music and singing.  Thank you to Terry and Dwayne for
helping to keep the coons out of my food each evening.  Thank you to all my
chili cooking volunteers.  And than you to Momma Bus for helping me to find
my lighter.
Dwayne and Nellie were the first to arrive on Thursday Evening. Now this
young man has learned quite a bit since our excursion to Buses N Boats.  He
now sports a screened in canopy, tent, and Nell made an awesome connector
from the screen room to the bus.  Truly awesome.  Yes, he did bring more
than a six pack this time, but when time came to refill, old habits came
flooding back and he bought a sixer.
Friday as everyone arrived, I spent most of the day getting ready.  Needed
the trash cans for the community area, needed to get a stick or two of
firewood, never know, somebody may build a fire!  We had a quaint little
community cooking over the fire.  Brian and Liz Powers graced us with their
presence once again, from Syracuse NY.  Brian must have really liked Rustic
Knolls, about an hour into it he was ready to call his father to invite him
from Syracuse.
Kevin and Joyce made it from Laporte IN, 4 kids and 6 bicycles in tow!  The
kids must have had a great time, I didn't see them the entire weekend.
Joe from Richmond Oh surprised us, 30 day tags and all.  Who needs to camp
at the COVVC site when you have a genuine gathering going on?
Joe and Erin and Joe made the maiden voyage from Pittsburgh.  Talk about
happy campers!  Glad you made it.
Matt from Toledo and his daughter brought the 71 bug for the show.  Hope you
had a good time.  Catch any fish?
The Warners brought the clan.  Their agenda was rest and relaxation!  I
trust you found some peace in my little area of paradise.  ABSOLUTELY NO
NEED TO APOLOGIZE.  Looking forward to the bird at Richmond.
Ted E Bare Finesman is  a stand up individual.  Great Jewelry.  I would love
to make the Jewel trip with you next year.
Traci and Kevin got shamed into joining us Saturday evening after the show.
They got lured into camping with the show people Friday evening.  Kevin has
the awesome purple Hippie Bus.  Glad Michele made it from Eaton Oh, yes a
bus is nice, but who needs it to have fun?  Thanx fro riding over with me to
the show.
Of course we had the world famous John Baker grace our little event.
Breakfast for dinner, water for breakfast....what a way to live.  Thanx for
entertaining us JB.
We had some new folks join us from Charleston WV, they won the 50/50 raffle,
and I 'll be dang if I can remember their names.  I know you had fun.  Find
Newark OK?
The Alexander's came over from Indy.  I met Steve at Buses N Boats, and what
I really enjoyed were the late night fire side chats.  Steve and Momma Bus
did not disappoint.  He and Dwayne make a great pair, Dwayne buys beer by
the small pack and Steve gets money for ATM one dollar at a time.

Saturday morning we had a 10 piece carabus over 34 miles of country roads.
Received great reviews.  We had a few enter the COVVC show.  410 registered
show cars this year!!  Dwayne sold his shirts for a buck a piece, and sold
out in an hour.  I should have bought em for a buck and sold em for two.  We
had our chili dinner, not how I expected it to turnout, but eatable non the
less.  We enjoyed fire, music and libations well into the morning.
Sunday morning we (well everyone but me) hustled around to make breakfast.
Truly awesome!

After everyone left, I laid down for a while to regroup before the arduous
task of packing up.  I took the scenic route home, about a 2 hour ride back
over to the show site to retrieve my signs.  There was a definite sign nazi,
all the egg farm signs were down!!

I stopped and talked with a local about the deer.  We should have went
hunting the other evening.  They have created these little masterpieces for
an auction.  I was told that they are beginning at $4,000.  Maybe we will
just use the picture I took.

Thank You everybody!  See you next year.

Who Built That Fire??

Frank
