Subject: Re: [T2] BustedBus is great!



&gt;Recently received an order from www.bustedbus_dot_com and was very satisfied.
&gt;It arrived quickly, all used parts were clean and looked as close to brand
&gt;new as possible.

    I second that.  In fact, the parts I ordered, (38 amp generator pulley
and a front belly pan) had been cleaned and repainted, in excellent
condition.  Timely shipping, too.  Sure beats going to the pick 'n pull and
getting all greasy and paying more for the parts.
