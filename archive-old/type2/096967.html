Subject: Busted Shock Mount [Was: Rear Shocks]

Well after going to the FLAPS to pick up a couple of CV boot kits and a
new rear 

shock, I discovered the worst when I pulled Kermit into the driveway and
started taking

a good look at the problem.

 

The almost two inches or so of metal around the upper mount has sheared
away from the

rest of the frame.  I am at a loss about what if anything can be done
about it.  The damage

looks pretty recent as the edges of the metal are very shinny and
jagged.  I'm playing every

thing back in my mind about the initial inspection (and I crawled all
over and underneath this

thing) and test drive.  I looked pretty carefully at the undercarriage
during my inspection and

the only damage that still stands out in my mind was a dent on one the
left rear outrigger (opposite

side from the shock in question.  The banging sound didn't register in
my mind until about halfway

back home from Seattle and not at all during the four or five miles
through bumpy Seattle streets

on the test drive with the PO.

 

I am definitely open to suggestions at this point.  Anybody know of a
shop in the Portland OR / Vancouver WA

area that can handle such a repair.  I'm definitely not willing to write
it off at this point.

 

Crying in my Pyramid Coastline pils,

 

Duke
