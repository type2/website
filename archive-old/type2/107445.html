Subject: RE: [T2] ECU faulty?

Good point. I wasn't really thinking solid state. I checked mine, and got
some interesting readings with the engine running. Both pins showed voltage;
one at 14, the other at 13. I only removed one connector though, and was
probably getting some signal back from the other injectors. I would suspect
that a total lack of any signal or ground at the ground pin would indicate
something wrong downstream from there.  I'll try to duplicate anything that
B-Rad comes up with...

Did you use an ohmmeter to see if the ground connections to to
&gt;injectors are actually being grounded when the engine cranks?

Will looking at the ECU transistor drivers with an ohm meter tell you any
anything?  I don't understand this measurement. Ohm meter measurements are
not normally made on active circuits.
