&gt;&gt; Ah, the infamous auxiliary battery.  I am seriously considering mountin
&gt;&gt; one in my newly acquired '81 Westy.  I think I know the basics of &gt; &gt; 
wiring 
&gt;it all up....
&gt;
&gt;I'd be interested in *HOW* to wire it all up!!

Hi!

We bought a deep discharge yaghting battery and a battery combiner from 
West Marine. If you can get your hands on one of their catalogs they 
have a fabulous section on installation with a schematic and clearly 
written text. West Marine is an AWESOME company to do business with - 
here's their number - give 'em a call and ask them to send you a 
catalog.

1 800 538 0775

Oh - I guess you could even live near one of their outlets - being so 
for up in the Sierra, I forget that other people might have direct 
access to things like stores!

P.S. We also bought the little tray that the battery sits is so it's 
anchored well. And Her Majesty has a 110 V (in - con??? verter) unit 
that we also bought from West Marine.
