Subject: WTB: Original VW springloaded pushrod tubes

I'm looking for the original VW aluminum springloaded pushrod tubes,
they were mostly used as replacement for one or two leaky pushrod
tubes on an otherwise healthy engine, so i don't expect to find
a 'complete' set of 8.

Please contact me if you have a few laying around.
Missing O-rings are OK. the tubes must not be dented and still have the
two aluminum washers included.

Thanks,

Brian.
