Subject: Re: [T2] Overheating (long)

How accurate is a head temp gauge VDO? I put one on my new motor and 
When I do 65 it get's up to 450F according to the gauge.
Around town it runs right at 350? My timing is on. The motor only has 
350 miles on it. Am I overheating it?

&gt;
&gt; High idle shouldn't cause the bus to overheat.  Your bumper can get 
&gt; very hot if you don't have the heat shield between the muffler and 
&gt; bumper (under the rear tin).  Other than that, I can't comment because 
&gt; there are way too many variables.  Get some gauges (oil temp and 
&gt; pressure) and some readings from them and we can go from there.  Or, 
&gt; you can &quot;fly blind&quot; like those budget-minded marketing people at VW 
&gt; intended (I'm sure the engineers were in favor of gauges).  :-)
