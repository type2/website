Subject: no sweat (was part# identification help)

hold those cards and letters: it was a horn tapperoonie. i remember
throwing a beat one in the can this week and it musta missed the trash
truck.  heavens to betsy, what a relief. THANKS!

&gt;Hi Stevo,
&gt;
&gt;    That part number is no longer in the price book, buy it looks like part
&gt;of the steering wheel, or column? Not sure.

&gt;
&gt;&gt; just about to cruise out on a dogwalk this evening and found a broken
&gt;&gt; black plastic pile of part shards under the streetlight out front. the
&gt;&gt;pieces
&gt;&gt; were real small. i couldn't make heads or tails of it them, except i found
&gt;&gt; the tiny vw insignia, and gathered three pieces with a nine digit part
&gt;&gt; number: 211.415.671 black, plastic 1-2&quot;, round. hopefully it'll be cheap
&gt;&gt; and replaceable :)       if it was mine, which i suspect it'd be off the
&gt;&gt;68 DC
