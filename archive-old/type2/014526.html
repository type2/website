Subject: Hey Folks, thanks for the helpful suggestions
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Thanks to all the replies that I got, and help from Isaiah in Oshkosh, WI, I 
was able to diagnose the problem and a garage in Appleton, WI,  got my tranny 
unlocked.  The Syncronization is out of wack in the transmission, and is 
still not right.  I'm going to give it my best shot and try to drive it home 
to Boston as is.

My travel route is going to take me through Eastern and South Eastern 
Wisconsin, Northern Illinois, Northern Ohio, Western and Northern 
Pennsylvania, as well as Southern and Central New York State then back to New 
England.

In case I have another lock up that I can't release, I'd like to get names 
and phone number of folks I might be able to make contact with on my way home 
in case I break down.  Any assistance would be much appreciated.   Just email 
me at 

Ricciotti_at_aol_dot_com, and I'll pick up my email from my cell phone along the 
way.   Thanks!

Chris Ricciotti
