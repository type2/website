List,
I want to reiterate i beleive Heinline's (could be wrong) concept of cheap if
not free parts trading between listmembers.  It's tough, i know - but soembody
charging 400 bux for a nose is like my brother- if you asked him a mechanical
question he'd stick out his hand... &quot;Twenty five bucks or i'm not sayin'
nothin...&quot;
Needless to say, my brother was an asshole.
Same guy baja'd a stock 62 beetle once.  You do the math.

Anyway, i just wanted to say i'm in favor of either cheap or free parts
trading between listmembers and will do my best to forward this cause.
However, almost on a backtrack and kindof contradicting myself...
I have a non-list buddy who has a gas heater from a mid-seventies bus.
This guy has few dollars and is restoring a 64 bus.
I've seen the prices on these things new.
So,
Knowing no details other than its stock and still in-situ, what would a
non-listmember price be for this thing come winter?

Thanx volx,

&gt; ...My friend just had a similar problem with a tree and he was able to find
a 
&gt; complete nose for a 71 at a swap meet for 65.00. He said a list member 
&gt; offered him one for 400.00....
