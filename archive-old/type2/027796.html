Subject: type2 price question

hi

im curious....am i likely to find a type 2 camper in good shape (minimal/no 
rust, no rot, mechanically sound, reasonably non-dented, heater works, etc) 
for under $2000? is $2500 more like it? im particularly interested in 78 and 
79 models w/ poptop.

my first foray into the land of camper classifieds online has not turned up 
much in the way of bargains. what i have found are vague ads without pix.

off list is fine.

thanks

kip
