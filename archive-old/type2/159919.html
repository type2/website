Subject: T1 oil pressure sender unit leak woes

I recently installed a rebuilt engine and am having a problem. I have an 
oil leak at the oil pressure sender unit.  It is not the sender.  I 
checked that carefully.  Simply put, even though I tighten the sender as 
tightly as seems safe, I still get a messy, steady leak.

I am working on the assumption that the threads are worn or 
semi-stripped, and am trying to come up with an answer.  I am 
considering coating them with something that would make them tighter, 
like a gasket sealer or red loctite.

Does anyone have any ideas or suggestions?

Many thanks,

John R.
