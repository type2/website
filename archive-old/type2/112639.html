Subject: 81 handle question

The outside handle on on the sliding door of my 81 westy was broken off 
before i bought it. Does any one have a good used replacement they are 
willing to part with? None of the yards around here have any year bus 
for parts.
Also any advice on how to remove the lock cylinder would be most 
appreciated.
Thanks
Tom
