Why do my wipers stop in the up position when I turn them off?  They did
this when I got the bus; but I've been putting off doing anything about
it because I plane to replace the whole nose at some point anyway.

BTW, if anybody has done one of these nose jobs, I'd love to hear how
you did it.  I have a clip from another late bay that was cut across the
roof behind the door pillars, and beneath the big seam just above the
front bumper.
