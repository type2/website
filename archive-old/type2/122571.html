Subject: Carb, Distributor &amp; Points replacement Choices???

Background 
72 1700cc rebuilt by NW connecting rod in Seattle WA.
I have an 009 and a vacuum advance dist. from a 79 2.0L engine in my
possession.
My carb is a Weber progressive.
The overall makeup of this engine is it is far from stock in terms of engine
accessory pieces.
Is there an ideal distributor to run on this engine?  Would one type be bad
to run on a stock 1700cc?  Which one will give me better performance?

I am looking at purchasing a compu-fire points replacement kit, any reason
this is a bad item versus other kits?  Do I need a particular coil other
than the Bosch stock coil?

Is there a dual carb set-up that would be optimal for this year &amp; engine
size?

I have some ideas of my own here but am more interested to see what popular
opinion from the list is.....
