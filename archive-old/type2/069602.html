Look at the output spec for the pump.  You want somewhere around 3
PSI.  Fuel injection systems run more like 30 PSI.  In the carburetor,
pretty much the only thing that holds the fuel back is the float,
which weighs almost nothing, sitting on top of a needle valve.  I
would guess that there are now problems with said float (more probably
with the valve it controls, or the hinges it rests on), since it just
got man-handled far more than it is used to.
