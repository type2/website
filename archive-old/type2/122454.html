Didn't know if anyone had answered your question, but here is one of THE
BEST Turkis double door passenger busses anywhere.

Even has the ultra rare double flip center seat.  I had the honor of seeing
this bus shortly after it was finished and this is one beauti of a bus.

&gt; L380 (42) Turquoise - L289 (17) Blue White
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone have a pic of this color scheme?
