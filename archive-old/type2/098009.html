Subject: Re: [T2] Synthetic Oil

I'm no engineer, but I figure a couple quarts of oil
is really pretty cheap. (a quart of synthetic costs
about same as a St*rbuck's cup o' joe.). doing the
change isn't fun, but even with the screen cleaning,
it's a hour's work.

So I run good dino oil and change it A LOT, like 1,500
miles. I hope that eliminates the problems of thermal
breakdown, molecular fatique, recovered-memory bearing
angst etc.

For what it's worth. I run 40w in the summer. And an
appropriate multigrade in winter.

What are we talkin' here? $10-$15 bucks including
gaskets every couple months? And that's if you're a
daily driver and put 50-1,500 miles a month on the beast.
