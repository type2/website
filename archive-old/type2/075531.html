Subject: VW Electric Power Connections

This site:
http://www.powerwerx_dot_com/powerpoles.html

will describe some power connectors that you might find handy for making 
solid and reliable splices to the electrical runs within your bus.

I use these Powerpole connectors so as to make wiring harnesses / modules 
out of my engine wiring.

This allows me to pull an engine without having to mess around undoing this 
wire, that wire, etc.
A simple &quot;unplug&quot; allows me to free up the engine from all of the various 
wires connected to the engine.

I also use a plug and harness module to make the electrical connections for 
my second battery run as well as the wiring of my starter to the relay used 
in the so-called &quot;hot start&quot; modification.

The 15 amp and 30 amp connectors are the same, with the exception of:
15 amp size wires easily to 16/18 gauge wire
30 amp size wires easily to 12 gauge wire.

As always............ use stranded wire for all VW electrical wiring so as 
to avoid connections vibrating loose or fatiguing as a function of time.
