&gt; I don't know the particulars, but I've had good
&gt; luck with the new engines I've received from Bus Depot.

Actually, I purchased the engines from Ronnie at Old Volks Home!

Both Old Volks Home and Bus Depot are fine establishments, but I wanted to
set the record straight  The engines I bought from Ronnie at Old
Volks Home arrived promptly, were securely packaged, and have run fine
since installed.  I will type up a detailed narrative of my experiences
with these engines as soon as I get a few miles on them.
