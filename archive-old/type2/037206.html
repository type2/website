&gt;Subject: Auto Tranny

&gt;I am having problems with my 74 auto tranny.  I have a 79 and would
like
&gt;to swap them.  Has anyone done this before?  I am running a 2.0L with
&gt;FI.
&gt;Thanks

I have put a 79 A/T in my 72 Bus and have researched the issue well
before I did it.
The post-75 A/T's have the actuating levers on the right. Both the
selector lever cable and the accelerator cable attach here on two
sepatate levers.
On pre 75 A/T's the accelerator cable goes past the tranny directly to
the engine and the selector cable attaches on the left (just like Type
III).
Post 75 A/T have a connecting rod from the tranny to the trottle. This
rod goes through (!!) the main crossframe where the top rubber mountings
are located. The pre 75 Busses do not have a hole there. It can be cut
though. If your car is carburated you need the connecting rod gismo from
a 75 to 79 european Bus.
This job can be done, and can be done well. My conversion looks factory
in every way, but it took me a year of planning, comparing, collecting
the parts. Actual work maybe 3 weekends plus electrics (I converted from
straight shift).
The original 73-74 A/T will work fine if fixed correctly. A rebuild kit
is about $130. New vacuum modulators are available for $5 (!), but need
to be individually adjusted. This way seems easier for you.
