Subject: [T2] Anyone in Gallup NM?

My son and two of his buds are broken down in Gallup, NM _at_ WalMart parking lot
They are on a between semester road trip from Fort Worth, TX.......
They are in a 85 Vanagon and from what they tell me, I think the waterpump 
has gone south........
Does anyone know of a VW shop in the area?   
I'm stuck away from my home and work computers (ice storm in FortWorth) and 
don't have anyway to get to the Vanagon list....... could someone forward 
this to that list?
They are going to call me back when they get a room in a motel across the 
street from where the Van is parked.......
Thanks,   Tom Laney _at_ 817-658-4550
