Subject: Brake pulsing issue

Ok, here's the skinny.

I just finished a major brake overhaul on my 78 Westy.  I replaced the
rotors, calipers, pads, hoses, hard lines to front calipers, master
cylinder, drums, wheel cylinders, shoes, brake adjusting stars and I think
that's about it.  Basically everything except that proportioning valve in
the back and the long brake lines from front to back.  The system has been
bled but the pedal still feels a tad soft.  I can deal with that issue but
the real kicker is that I get a strong pulsing from the pedal during
braking.  It actually pushes my foot up and down.  I've read through the
archives and the usual culprit is faulty drums.  These drums are brand new.
I did have the rear shoes adjusted in a bit far but I've backed them way
out and it still happens.  WTF?  I'm getting the westy ready to sell but I
need to take care of this before I can have it inspected.

One thing that was a bit unusual was that I received two passenger side
calipers originally.  I installed them and then realized that one bleeder
valve was on top and the other side had a valve on the bottom.  I sent that
one back and received a normal two-bleeder valve caliper.  So one side has
a one-bleeder caliper and the other has a two-bleeder.  Is there some
contention between them or is that a non-issue?

Any ideas are welcome as always.
