Rob, That was a great story about your new camper.

The awning that you have looks very much like the awning that I got with my 1971
camper. It was the same color, and in fact consisted of not only an awning, but an
enclosed room that you could set up. I really loved that one. It would drive at 72
mph anywhere I chose to take her. She was heavy enough to stay reasonably straight
with cross winds, and she just went and went! :-}

I miss her :-{

Ron C.
BTW, I called her a &quot;Day Camper&quot;, not knowing what these non-poptops were called.
