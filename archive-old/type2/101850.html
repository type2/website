&gt; Hey Terry...

&gt; Tire shredding has been around for MANY years...we used it in the 60s and 70s to
&gt; get our ice racing tires to &quot;bite&quot;....dirt trackers still do it today...truckers
&gt; do it too, but with larger grooves...they call it re-grooving...

&gt; Not an artform you'll likely see in a &quot;new&quot; tire store, but it sounds like you
&gt; may have lucked out...

You can get it done in many tire stores in the northern tier states.
Seems to me that if it was a good idea the manufacturers would do it at
the factory.  I have a feeling that there is a downside in tire wear
(either faster or uneven)

I know that my Bridgestone RD603s are pretty slippary in snow.  My
solution is to avoid snow when I can!  I have a pair of Uniroyal Laredo
all-season that I carry just in case.  I don't recommend them for normal
use, though, as they are too small.
