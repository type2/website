Mark:

I had been turning the same thing over in my mind for quite a while, but
eventually parted company with $129 just to preclude a charge of
&quot;tampering&quot;.

Having just passed inspection, there is some temptation to remove the
filter to preserve it for next time.

I don't think there's charcoal in there.  I would expect it to be
granular, and no amount of shaking could elicit any sound of such from
the new EGR filter.  I'm guessing that there's just something like steel
wool or (preferably) bronze wool inside the canister.  Can't believe
these things are very sophisticated (other than the weird shapes).  The
price is a matter of what the market can bear.

Has anyone on the List ever cut one open and can testify as to its
contents?

Giff
