I assume you mean engine hatch, if so change in US models occured in '77,
Prior to this they use discreet 3 part (2 halves and a pin) hinges sort of
like single cab toolbox door hinges, after that they use a 2 part sort of
pin and loop arrangement, perhaps superior and less likely for the pin to
rust out, perhaps not.  Who knows.  An interesting note is that apparently
the single cabs went to these as well eventually though I can't hazard to
guess when as the toolbox doors available from California Import Parts and
others over here (assuming of South American origin) also feature the later
style hinge and require slight modification to be used on the typical pre
'71 US bay window single cab.
