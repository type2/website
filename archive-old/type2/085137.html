Hello

&gt; As a new member not sure if you guys can help me.  I have a 73
&gt; bus that I have recently purchased.  I'm currently checking and replacing
&gt; any worn brake and suspension parts.  I am looking at the front bearings
&gt; they sound good and there is no play but I'm not sure if they need
&gt; greasing
&gt; every 30,000 miles or something.  My manual states how to do this for upto
&gt; 72 models but not for later models, do I take it they are sealed unit and
&gt; don't need to be done?
&gt; 
&gt; Can anyone help me!
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
&gt; 
&gt;
