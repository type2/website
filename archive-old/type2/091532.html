Subject: Re: [T2] Explain vacuum

nikki,
	google had the vacuum page cached here:

	http://216.239.51.100/search?q=cache:VzsiRbXw7_8C:www.type2_dot_com/library/fuel/vacuum.htm+vacuum+%2B+engine+%2B+carb+%2B+explained&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8

As far as your question about burning up valves due to vacuum leaks, I
hope this helps. So we know that an engine is basically a pump for
air, sure it does cool things like convert fuel into power, but it's
also a pump. This pump pulls in air from the outside &amp; does stuff with
it. In a good system all the air is accounted for in the fuel/air
mixture. The more air you introduce into the combustion chamber for
the spark plug ignite the hotter the explosion will be. The only
example i can think of for this is a charcoal grill. next time you
grill out (away from you bus :) don't open all the vents on the bottom
of the grill. You should see that the charcoal burns at a lower temp,
which means longer wait for the burgers. The engine works the same
way. since air is a so-so thermal conductor (say verses water) we vw
owners have to watch the temp that our heads get from how hot the
explosion is. 

A vacuum leak introduces extra air into our &quot;pump&quot; which isn't
accounted for by the carb (or fi system). this means that more air is
present than we really want for a good slightly cooler burn. this is
why it's dangerous to run a lean (or extra air) mixture. While it's
called lean, most cases it's actually an increase of air not decrease
of fuel that is the proble. It's just a leaner mixture if we compare
the volume of air. Hope this helps, &amp; good luck.

&gt; I already looked in the Library, hopefully clicked on &quot;Vacuum Explained,&quot; 
&gt; and it linked me to the Carburetor section, and I'm sure somewhere in one 
&gt; of those articles is the information I seek, but I'm that lost that since 
&gt; it wasn't the title of an entry, I didn't know where to start. I found out 
&gt; yesterday there's nothing in Muir, and the only mention in Bentley is 
&gt; regarding the vac adv/ret distributor (which I no longer have).

&gt; Most importantly, I'd like vacuum explained in an overview so it's not such 
&gt; a MYSTERY! So far I gather it's a carb thang? And it's vital to the health 
&gt; of the engine, because &quot;Vacuum leaks burn valves.&quot; How? Why? What to do 
&gt; about it?
