Subject: Re: [T2] bus runs good, then bad

Steve,

Have him look for a restriction in the exhaust..._dot_debris and/or squeezed 
tubing somewhere.

If it was really bad, the engine would start, run fine for a few 
minutes/seconds and then die.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Rob's bus was the fourth I checked.  He had a couple problems, but he
&gt; major one was a sudden loss of power, bus barely ran.
&gt; 
&gt; First, checked the dwell, which was way out.  I pulled th epoints because
&gt; I suspected that he rider on the points had broken, but it was fine.  Put
&gt; them back in and set the dwell.  Ended up at 51 degrees, whihc is pretty
&gt; fine :-)  Of course, I had them set onece, buttoned it up, rechecked and
&gt; they were near 90!!! So I tore it back apart, and reset and reset w/o any
&gt; apparent change...  then the lady who was holding the flashlight asked me
&gt; if the sensor wire for the dwell meter should not be hooked up :-((((
&gt; Some days....
&gt; 
&gt; OK, so...  with dwell set, we checked timing, which was fine and advancing
&gt; correctly both on advance and retard (despite the webber progressive, Rob
&gt; has plumbed in the stock vac advance/retard dist with correct vacuum
&gt; hookups for both)
&gt; 
&gt; Then we moved on to vacuum, which was a major problem.  First, the fuel
&gt; delivery on his bus is a webber progressive, about which I know absolute
&gt; *beans*!  and care for them even less.  Sorry, my predjudice showing.
&gt; The vacuum was slightly less than OK (13-15&quot;) at normal idle (800-1000),
&gt; but after running a minute or two, the idle dropped off to near nothing
&gt; and the engine started to idle like... err...  badly.  The needle on the
&gt; vac gauge also went into a very fast vibration between 5-12&quot;.  I had never
&gt; seen this behavior before, and do not know what to say about it.  It was
&gt; decidedly odd.  anyone out there ever seen this?

&gt; &gt; 72 camper, with new AVP 2000 rebuilt. Most miles on it to and from Everybus,
&gt; &gt; around 200.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My bus runs good for a while, then will start running poorly. The single
&gt; &gt; Weber progressive starts the bus cold just fine. Idles good and even starts
&gt; &gt; out good. After a while though I lose most power, as if I'm not getting
&gt; &gt; enough gas or something. I can drive it, but its sluggish and backfires. It
&gt; &gt; won't idle when it does this either. I don't know why but the second time
&gt; &gt; this happened the rpm's flew up as if the choke was on. I stomped the gas
&gt; &gt; and it ran fine after that.
