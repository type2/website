Subject: exhaust stud dilemma 

Mark:  I tried for an entire Saturday, gave up, and pulled the engine.  
I've found no real alternative to this.  I used penetrating oil, lots 
of heat, the old wax trick, vice grips, screw extractor, cutting a 
screwdriver slot in the old one. You name it. All these either did 
nothing or shortened what was left of the old screw. A machine shop can 
mount a head in a drill press and drill out the old steel stud. Worse 
comes to worse, if the 8mm thread gets ruined, just tap for 10mm and 
use a step stud.
