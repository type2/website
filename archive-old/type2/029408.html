&gt; If you are truly determined to fabricate your own filler hose, try using
&gt; marine exhaust hose material.  It's pretty much bullet-and everything
&gt; else-proof, and can be had with wire reinforcing molded in.  It's pretty
&gt; pricey stuff, but wouldn't be too bad for a short length.  Gates is the most
&gt; commonly encountered brand...

Gates also makes genuine fuel-proof hose in large sizes.  As I recall,
it's called
&quot;Green Stripe&quot;, although this might describe hose other than fuel-proof.
It's pricy too.
