Anything out of adjustment will cause a problem.  Have you visually inspected
the wheel cylinders, shoes, drums, brake booster and hoses (if present) to 
verify
that they are serviceable?

&gt;  Also which way do the stars turn to adjust the rear brakes in?

John Muir's fine old book &quot;How to Keep Your Volkswagen Alive......&quot;
is a wealth of information, presented in a folksy way, for the beginner.

I would also suggest that you replace the brake fluid and the rubber
brake lines, in that order.

Have you replaced all fuel lines and grommets?  Do a search in the Archives
for &quot;engine fire,&quot; if you need convincing.
