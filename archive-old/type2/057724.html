&lt;&lt;Also, in general, does anyone know where I pick up a new O-ring for that

914 sump plate -- is this something I have to go to Porsche for, or is it

standard enough that I would be able to get it at VW or a FLAPS (and will

they know what I'm talking about)?



Anyway, grateful in advance for your help.

I installed a oil temp gauge in my sump plate a couple of months ago.  The
plate was painted on the bottom, and not painted on the inside.  If you use
some Navel Jelly, or other rust remover, you should have no problems.  You
could also just lightly sand off the rust, or use a wire brush.  You should
paint the outside again, but leave the inside bare.

I tried to replace my O ring, but the local VW FLAPS said I would have to
purchase the whole engine gasket kit.  I just reused my old one.
