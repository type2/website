 a 2 L I  think?

Hi John,

Should be a 2.0L and I put a 76 2.0 in my 74 bus.  The problem I ran into was
flywheel and pressure plate to bellhousing interference.  My 76 engine had the
228 mm clutch, pressure plate, and flywheel.  If yours also has the 228 mm
clutch, you could grind out the bell housing for clearance, but you would need a
late starter to clear the flywheel.  I had a friend machine an approximately 12
mm thick spacer for the starter as the newer trans was thicker.  Then discovered
the bellhousing interference (I felt dumb for not checking clearence, all I
would have had to do is try to turn over the engine by hand :&gt;((.)  Solved the
problem by using 218 MM clutch, flywheel and pressure plate from the 74 engine.
If you know what you got and don't street race, the smaller clutch will serve
well.  By the way, the newer starter is much pricier than the early one.

Keep smiling,

Mike

&gt; 73 tranny/bell housing?
