Ok, I found out (after boogering up my crank timing gears) that you can't
use a bench vise (even a REALLY big one) to substitute for an arbor press.
Question is, is there another way to get these gears off without one, or
other special tools I don't have? I should mention that I'm allergic to
paying anyone to do mechanical work I can learn to do myself unless there is
really no other way.
Question 2: what is the bolt size for the attachment bolts on the outer ends
of my 71s front bumper? Is there a parts book availablr that would show
this?
BTW, thanks to those who responded to my ? on engine tin - it was a big
help.

Tom
