Re replacing fuel sender:
I have a 75 bus where the PO had cut a square hole above the gas tank to
presumably replace the sender.   I have a protocol for this somewhere which
was posted on Compuserve, can look it up for you.   While one CAN remove
the firewall behind the engine to see the tank and test the sender, it is
quite long and I don't know if it will clear the floor above when pulled
out.  So you'd end up pulling the engine, which is the Bentley manual
reccomendation.  Me, I'd keep a LOG of when I filled up, or consider
cutting the hole above the tank, which can be covered by a slightly larger
piece of sheet steel, some gasketing, and sheet metal screws.  Others on
this list may have actually tried the latter......MB
