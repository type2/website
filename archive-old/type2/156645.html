Subject: Re: [T2] CHT Wows and Concerns

- yesterday I remembered that
&gt; last year I had noticed that the connecting flexible
&gt; hose from the heater
&gt; boxes to the pipes that look like louvered exhaust
&gt; pipes were shot and was
&gt; going to replace them.  Ooops... didn't do that.  I
&gt; cobbled together some
&gt; this morning for a temporary fix but need new ones. 
&gt; Do you folks think that
&gt; this may have been a major cause for high head
&gt; temps?  Where is a good
&gt; source for this flexible tubing?
&gt; 
Not a major cause - just another piece of the puzzle.
Relatively minor one, I'd say. The gaps from the AC
tin may be more of a cause.

Consider that you're bus is working very hard and
pushing a lot of air... On a 90 degree day it is
generally best to go easy on it. Plan your sections
where you'll need to go fast on the freeway for early
mornings. If you have to be out in the heat, try to
select roads you can mosey on. Without some reference
to see what #1 is doing in that same situation, it is
next to impossible to diagnose or even speculate on
how hot is hot. 450 is hot - but that doesn't say much
in and of itself. -BaH
