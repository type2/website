Subject: firetruck hoses

hey guys, not sure if these will fit but those of you
with firetruck would know anyway but in the
sportsman's guide www.sportsmansguide_dot_com they are
selling german fire hoses so it might be worth a look
if you have a fire truck or are making a firetruck or
heck, if you are a fireman with too much cash on your
hands.
