&gt; Glad this topic came up. I'm a new bus driver and I don't know how/when to
&gt; shift. We don't have a tach yet and I'm trying to shift based on the sound
&gt; of the engine while driving and how much power it gives me after I shift.

most VW speedometers I have seen have the shift points marked with little
red hashes,  I, II, III.

this is a good guide until you get to know your engine/trans/bus
