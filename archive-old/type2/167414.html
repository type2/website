Subject: Re: [T2] Bus motor replacement

Hi Volks,

When I went FI with a 1973 single-outlet tank I cut down a spare  
passenger side fuel rail to make a pair of metal T fittings. One of  
which is in my spares pile, the other has one end attached to the  
tank, one end attached to the fuel filter, and the third end attached  
to the fuel return line.

It has been two years running without issue. All you need is a T, not  
a tank swap.


Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
