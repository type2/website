Subject: Re: It (80 Westi) lives!

There can be lots of FI things that can cause this sort of rich running: 
basic fuel/air mixture set incorrectly, a stuck or leaky injector(s), fuel 
pressure too high, bad temp sensor(s), etc. etc.  There's also the &quot;weak 
spring&quot; problem of AFM's this age, though that seems to make it 
impossible or difficult to pass smog, and I've not yet seen the case 
where it makes the engine run so rich that it bogs down.  There's even 
some pretty obscure and hard-to-diagnose things like shorted coaxial 
cables from the O2 sensor.  Of course, this assumes the problem doesn't 
lie elsewhere, like the ignition system!

Unless you get lucky and replace the right part the first time, you 
really have to approch these sort of problems step-by-step, testing each 
part in the system.  Make yourself a fuel pressure gauge ($10-$15), get a 
digital multimeter ($20 - $XXX) and a manual ($10 - $25).  A good and 
commonly available manual is &quot;Bosch Fuel Injection &amp; Engine Management&quot; 
by Probst.  Start with everything else right (i.e., ignition, mechanical) 
and start diagnosing.

&gt; It's an all california model, emission wise and everything seems to be in
&gt; decent working order. Is there something obvious I'm missing? I've played
&gt; around with it most of the evening, but haven't had any luck. Thanks!
