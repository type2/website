Subject: Re: [T2] Heater Controls

&gt;Have been looking for the heater control cable for a 1974 Westy. The
&gt;cable measures 16 inches. It attaches to the slider nearest the steering
&gt;wheel. It has a connector at both ends. Typical looking VW cable.
&gt;Anybody know where these are available new? Would anyone have a good
&gt;used that they would part with? Thanks.

Check with motorcycle or bicycle mechanics - they maybe able to make you 
what you need.
