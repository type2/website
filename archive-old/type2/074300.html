&gt; To the list,
&gt; I have since pulled my heads (that were rebuilt 4000 miles ago)on my '73 Bus
&gt; (1.7l) and discovered that the intake valve on #1 cylinder dropped its seat,
&gt; jammed the valve open and gouged the top of my piston.
&gt; 	Questions:
&gt; 		1. Why the intake and not the exhaust seat? Is this common?

I think exhaust is more common, but the damage is pretty much the same

&gt; 		2. The seat really trashed the pocket it sits in. Is this fixable/worth
&gt; fixing?

probably would cost more than a decent head.

&gt; 		3. My piston has a gouge were the valve hit it. Should I be concerened
&gt; about the
&gt;                connecting rod and/or the crank? Can I check without
&gt; splitting the case?

see if the rod, piston move freely, if you didn't run it long it probably
is not damaged.  clean the top of the piston, clean up rough edges of
gouge if it is less than half the debth of the piston metal and there are
no cracks the piston is probably reusable

&gt; 		4. If the head is trash, what are my options? Can I replace the one head
&gt; or do I
&gt;                need to do it in pairs? Are their different kinds of 1.7
&gt; heads?

you can do one head.


now Doc Tim would insist on a complete rebuild and I would schedule a
major overhaul at some point, but you probably can easily get many
thousand miles out of a patch job.  heck I did the same thing to mine and
replaced just one piston and cly, and the head without even removing the
engine, then drove it for two more years 20k+ miles before getting it all
together for a complete rebuild

of course YMMV
