Subject: Re: [T2] WTB: '72 Type 2 Owner's Manual

Sir,

I have a used one but it is a little beat up. Every pages is there and very 
readable. Just the back cover is missing and the front is well, not so 
great. If you are not looking for something to put out with your bus at a 
show then give me a call.

-Joe

&gt;I received no responses to my previous request for a '72 owner's manual.
&gt;
&gt; Does anyone have one they would like to sell&gt;&gt;??
