Subject: New VW Camper
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hello,
     I saw in a European VW magazine-Volks World and
ad for new VW campers-bay window style.  The web page
is:  www.beetles-uk_dot_com.  It does not give much info. 
Does anyone have any pictures of any of them-or own
one?  I am interested in upholstery.  I want to try to
look at as many different ideas as possible before I
do it.  I have been wanting to do it for a long time. 
Thanks a lot.  I really appreciate the help.

Peace,
Tim
