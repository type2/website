Subject: Re: [T2] Replacement Panel for a 72 BUS!!!!!!

If cost is no option you can still get them from Axel Stauber in Germany.
It's the shipping that is expensive.
You can use the 73- panels but you need additional panels and some cutting
and welding to make it work with a 68-72.


&gt;Does anyone have or know where i can get a replacenment panel for my 1972 
&gt;bus. Im looking for the entire front end piece. From the bottom of the 
&gt;window frame down to the floor. I need a &quot;decent&quot; one if it is used. PLEASE

&gt;PLEASE help me out. The only ones sold through the vendors are the 73+
ones. 
&gt;Someone must know where to get it! Ok. I hope to hear some good news.
Thanks
