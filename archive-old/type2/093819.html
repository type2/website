Subject: Swing Lever Pin etc.

Can anyone help me with the order of the gaskets, washers, etc. on the
center pin?
I got the center pin kit, got the bushings in and now can't for the life of
me determine the order or where the numerous washers go.
this is what I have:
small cap
big cap with hole (for Pin?)
floppy washer (pretty thick)
medium washer (hole bigger than pin, size of bearings inside)
small rubber washer (for indentation on swing lever?)
really small metal washer (fits snuggly around pin)
relatively big flimsy rubber gasket 

do any of these go on the bottom where the head of the pin is?
does the floppy go under the big cap?
on top is the big washer first then floppy then cap?
I went to some effort to get the beam off and the bushings in and now I want
to make sure I do this right.
Help.
