&gt; &quot;Headlight washers&quot;?  Did i miss something? Somebody hook me up here...

Sounds like a European thing. Headlight washers are really good--check out
the new Mercedes to see what they look like. Headlight washers and headlight
wipers because clean headlights work better than dirty ones and no one ever
washes the headlights. So they put headlight washers in and now when you
wash the windshield, you wash the headlights too.
