&gt; &gt;What is the downside of 79's? i understand tha the 77's don't have

&gt; 
&gt; The '79's have the &quot;vanagon&quot; heads which have more rectangular exhaust
&gt; ports.  As a result of this, I believe the '79 exhaust parts are somewhat
&gt; unique.  Some of the 78 parts won't fit, ditto the 80-up Vanagon parts.
&gt; Not an insurmountable problem, but significant.
