Greetings from South AL....

Daupb!

That's right- I let mom use my bus for a week.  I should have known better-
especially since she hasn't driven a VW in 30 years.  My baby is now giving
me a grinding sound, almost like a starter gear rubbing on the flywheel
sound when in gear but clutched.  Also, even when fully clutched she grinds
into reverse and sometimes will get into a &quot;mood&quot; of barely shifting at all-
almost like having no clutch at all or the shifter is in reverse lock-out
mode.  I can't seem to figure out why and how in the world my mother did it.
ARG!

Anyway- the rest of this only pertains to the South-AL area:

I'm looking for a project bug in the southwest AL/ northwest FL area- $500
or less.  email me for any info.  I now live in the Flomaton/Century area.

Bus for sale- just west of Atmore (south on 31) at the scrap yard on the
left- a kombi Vanagon in good shape, running, he wants $1600 I think.

Dude- I know you are on here- Atmore area- Ghia for sale.... where are
you????

Wade
