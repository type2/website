I am a government employee with a degree in engineering. I am but one of
many who make sure the city has excellent quality drinking water--at least
for the next 84 days. At that point I am moving back to Idaho with or
without a job. I currently have an open invitation to direct and write my
own radio program. I will also be persuing graduate school where I was
approached to teach this fall. Karl von Salzen told me once that if your not
having fun at work, then it is work. Did I get that right Karl? Anyway, it's
time to move on. One of the best vehicles I've ever owned was my 69
squareback. The only problem was, I couldn't cook in it. :-)
