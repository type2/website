Subject: Re: [T2] Bus for sale

Finally (and I can't do better than this):

One day you'll feel like playing hooky. A perfect day, maybe next 
March. It's worth waiting for. You'll call in sick and decide to drive 
on over to Joshua Tree and watch lean climbers scale boulders with 
unmatched grace. You'll cope with the Riverside freeway and wonder 
whether you did the right thing. But at some point you will pass 
through Riverside, glide beyond Redlands, and head out through the 
windmills in the Coachella Valley. And the skies will be filled with 
the sound of &quot;Jessica,&quot; Dickey Betts moving ever onward and upward, 
hittin' the note. Your face will be filled with a precoprolite-eating 
grin. That day, my friend, you will understand the delayed 
gratification that comes with owning and driving a VW bus.
