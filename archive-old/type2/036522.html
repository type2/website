Charles,

There is some good information in the list library - check out Trevor Bessy's
ransvair article in the &quot;engine conversions&quot; section (his was in a '70 Westy
though).  The idea of more horses in the rear appeals to me, especially on the
interstate  :)  After doing some homework and talking to a buddy who's done
similar conversions, I decided that I don't have the cash, time or tools to
attempt it, and taking the bus to my favorite mechanic and saying &quot;Here, you do
it..&quot; is pretty much OOTQ (out of the question).  My 2 pesos ..
