Subject: Powder Coating shops in Los Angeles

Does anyone have any recommendations for powder coating facilities in 
LA.  Turns out that rustoleum paint isn't that tough.  I shot a painted 
part with break cleaner and it took the paint off instantly.  I figure 
gasoline and oil will ultimately have the same effect.  Ugh.. that was 
definately a waste of time to paint all those parts.

So, if anyone has any shops that they've worked with and like the 
service, I'd appreciate the info.  Also, if you have any prices for past 
work, I'm just curious as to what it would cost to do all the tin and 
the fan cooling housing.

thanks,
Mike
