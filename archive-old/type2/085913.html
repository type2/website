Subject: Re: [T2] Looking for Alternator Conversion Kit for 71 Westy

	I would add that if you are running any kind of stereo amplification, or 
air conditioning, or want to add a power inverter, the bigger alternator is 
a good idea.

&gt;I _think_ that the &quot;75A&quot; alternator is a rewound unit, made to replace the
&gt;stock ~50A unit.  I don't really see why you would need the 75A unit
&gt;unless you're running lots of off-road lights.  Better to save the bucks
&gt;and keep it stock!
