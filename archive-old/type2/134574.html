Subject: Re: [T2] CA smog: we're boned - Advice needed.

You could be right. Since getting rid of our smog vehicles, I'm not up on 
the current standards.

----- Original Message ----- 

&gt; I don't think you were smogged at the new standards in March because
&gt; the
&gt; bill was just passed.

The elimination of the 30-year exemption was just passed... but the new
requirements (and dyno testing) went into effect earlier, right?  We
bought a new Passat in April, and a couple of months prior to that had
our outgoing Honda Accord smog'd, and they definitely ran it on the
dyno.
