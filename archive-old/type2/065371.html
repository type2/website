Like was mentioned earlier, the sodium reacts with water to form sodium
hydroxide and hydrogen
2Na + 2H2O gives 2NaOH + H2
While the reaction of sodium with water is fairly violent (you would not
want to get hit with molten sodium) the real danger comes with the hydrogen
that is produced.  As the sodium reacts it heats up and the hydrogen that is
produced can cause real problems.
Just my two cents,
OK I can't take credit for this, I asked my graduate advisor who is a chemist,
brett
