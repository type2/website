Subject: artificial rain gutters

Readers Digest. Illiterates die of intestinal blockage.

I plan to install two pairs of artificial rain gutters on the fiberglass 
poptop on my '78 Westy

How far apart should the be between the front and back pair;  and how far 
should the ear most pair be  from the rear end of  fiberglass top.

I want to be able to put some Thule Bike rack bars on the gutters in the 
future, but I prefer that they be spread as wide apart as possible, and as 
near the rear of the fiberglass top as possible (3 feet??)

Thanks

Oh, yes, I just upgraded my Sprint PCS plan so I can now make and receive 
calls on my trip down to and  through Florida, starting in 9 hours .  571
