Hi Bob,

Surprisingly enough, I've never seen rain make more than a miniscule 
dent in the reading from my CHT Gauge. Maybe 20 degrees, but not more 
than that. A water-spray injection system dispensing a trickle directly 
into the cooling fan would be a lot more effective, and could be set up 
to be triggered under heavy-load conditions where additional cooling 
would temporarily protect cylinder heads from catastrophic failure. 
This would bring the H2O directly into the cooling air stream instead 
of deflecting it as the design of the bus air intakes is prone to do.

Water-injection was used successfully in the fuel system of German WWII 
fighter aircraft. It allowed a short-term increase in power that could 
mean life-or-death to a pilot in a dogfight. You want to remember that 
those engines had a much more intense maintenance schedule than what 
our german iron is usually treated to.

As Scott Lyons said the first time this thread came around: FIRST 
PRIORITY should be to make sure that your existing cooling system is 
running at 100% efficiency, with no air leaks or missing seals.

Happy trails,
