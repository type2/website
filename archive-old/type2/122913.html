Subject: Re: [T2] Loose shifter

Ok,

I have been fighting with my shifting for almost as long as I've had my bus.
But I've finally got it down. I know EXACTLY what you're talking about.  I
fixed this very problem, but ... the thing is, I didn't do it myself.
Regardless, the guy who I paid to do it just replaced the whole darn hockey
stick, I believe that is the rod that goes from the ball end of the shifter,
and ends midway back to the transmission (corrections anyone?).  So, that
fixed the rotating thing.  He also gave me a used shift rod.

I believe this problem occurs when the ball and socet mechanism at the joint
of the shift rod and hockey stick arent connected well.  It isn't hard to
take the shift rod out of the floor if you want to check out the parts for
wear ... just unscrew the  bolts holing the shift rod down.  There's a
spring under that first plate, which sits on top of the reverse stop plate.
Just remember which way the reverse stop plate is sitting there and prepare
to get greasy.

I'm not sure how hard it is to replace the hockey stick, but the shift rod
is a cinch.

Of couse, it could be something totally different for you ... haha ... Good
luck.
