	Hi.  I'm having my usual problem of the non-starting bus.  This seems to
happen to Wolfgang about every 9 months, and I want to fix it with my own
hands for a change.

A little History:

	My grandparents bought it new in Germany in 79.  Manual tran, 2 liter FI,
nothing fancy.  They gave it to me in 90 -- my first car.  I painted it
zevra, drove it everywhere and put all my money into it for 3 years, which
wasn't enough to keep him healthy.  Still ran okay (fuel injection is a
beautiful thing) until I sold it before I got married in 93.

	1997: For the first time in 4 years, I see him in Stow, Ohio parked in a
little lot off of main street... for sale.  Two days later (my birthday), I
buy him for way too much money ($1700) without checking out anything but
the rust and the odometer.  The (very nice but not so savvy) people I
bought him from had paid big money to put in a '73 engine with a webber
2-throat carb.  It seemed to run fine.  It has a really dumb cut-up chevy
air-filter holder which I hope to replace someday.  Later it needed new
coil,etc.


	Summer 1998: Rebuilt the body the cheap way: i'll do it right later when
I'm rich.(?)  Got the carburator rebuilt, and it ran beautifully through a
very cold winter.  

Note: I'm still a beginner mechanic.  If I'm an idiot, let me know and I
will be happy to do something different next time.

	It started to run a little rough through this spring, and the exhaust
started smelling gassy.  (Mixture or weak spark?  I have not yet become one
with my carburator).
On the way to Burger King one day, I was going down a little hill in third,
foot off the gas, and I thought, &quot;It's about to backfire.&quot;  Too late,
*bang*, a big noise, and I'm stalled, coasting with traffic behind me.  I
start it up again fine, but just after catching, it dies again.  Three or
four tries for this, and I get off the road.  While the engine was still
hot, I tried starting a few more times and other than the occasional
momentary roar to life, it wouldn't go.  It sounded sort of like the timing
was off by a good amount, the way it snorted and spat.  Once it cooled
down, It wouldn't catch at all.

After 3 weeks of occasional tries to start it, today my good pal Jim and I
checked it out somewhat today.  Here's what I found:

Nice white spark from all four plugs.
The front (front is front) left plug (#3?) was sort of oily.  All plugs
were black
All plugs smelled nicely of gasoline.
New points are gapped at about .016

All 8 valves are opening and closing.  I don't know if the guy who built
the engine put in hydraulic lifters or not, and I haven't checked the valve
gap.  When I took off the valve covers, they appeared to have a few drops
of water in them.

Spraying starter spray into the carburator doesn't help it go.  

Occasionally a little spray will spurt up out of the carburator when I try
to start it.

It doesn't even try to catch.  Just chigga-chugga-chigga-chugga, and
sending fumes out the (cheap, dual, illegal exhaust put in by the PO)
mufflers alternating as it should.

I haven't checked the compression.

Playing with the timing (by rotating the distributor) makes no difference.

All fuses are intact.

Gas is in the tank.  

Spark is in the plugs.

I don't have a lot of time.

Or money.

But I'm a real nice guy.

Any thoughts?  Me and Jim is stumped.
