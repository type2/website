Subject: RE: [T2] Friday bus sightings

The move is Cheaper by the Dozen, I saw a sneak preview last Friday and I
would give it a two thumbs up, it helps if you like Steve Marten also...
It will be out on the Dec 25th I think, here is a link to the move,
http://www.cheaperbythedozenmovie_dot_com/ I have meet the owner Georgia of the
bus &quot;Holly&quot; once and she lives up near Chicago IL.

My family keeps telling me about a new movie, the trailer, showing a bus...I
believe it's a Steve Martin movie, but I am not sure.
FWIW
