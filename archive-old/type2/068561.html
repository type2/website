Could one take an old rear hatch lock and put it in the engine compartment?
 Maybe mean re-keying or hanging on to another key, but if it would work, it
would be worth it.  BTW, could someone remind me of the way to re-key a lock.
 I thought I read something about it about a month ago, but cannot find the
info.  I thought it was something about repositioning the tumbler thingies in
the lock itself.  

thanks...
