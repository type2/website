Subject: RE: [T2] Main Harness - how difficult to replace

Yeah, that's the one. Where it enters the engine compartment some brilliant
PO had cut the wires. The bus was not running when I got it so I have no
idea of the condition of much of the wiring. I did pick up a brand new
wiring harness for $50 though. I have the engine out now and the dash has to
come out too for some rust repair under and behind the windscreen. I figured
that if I am ever going to do it this might be the time.
 
&gt; When you say main wiring harness just how MAIN do you mean? 
&gt; If you are speaking of everything that hooks to the fusebox 
&gt; and goes back to the motor then you are in for a big job. The 
&gt; big question is if the existing wiring is brittle, or has 
&gt; really been Frankensteined...
