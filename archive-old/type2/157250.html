&gt; According to Bentley, the pistons are oriented a certain way based on
&gt; the rotation of the rotor.  The pistons are upside down.  Bentley says
&gt; to use a special tool to reorient the pistons.  Ri-i-i-i-ght!

No hard to do.  Take a small pair of channellock pliers, put the head
inside the hollow piston. Pull the handles apart and turn to the correct
position.  As long as the caliper has bleeders on both ends it will work
for either side.
