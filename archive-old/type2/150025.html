&gt; Very bizarre indeed....
&gt; 
&gt; Since reproing this item in January 2004, (VWG/Airhead Parts) has sold 263
&gt; of these with nary a peep about &quot;hard-to-fit&quot; or &quot;doesn't fit&quot; from the
&gt; shops that we mainly supply to (including Bus Depot).  I have an NOS Boot
&gt; and one of VWG's here side by side on my desk and cannot tell the difference
&gt; in materials, shore hardness (how hard or soft it is), size or shape that
&gt; would keep it from fitting properly on Troy's Bus.

There ARE shrouds with different size openings. There are actually three
alternator boot part numbers, the early T4 one, middle (the one repro'd by
VWG) and the late 70A one. But I am still trying to figure on how the repro
cannot be fitting, because if Troy had a very early T4 shroud, the new repro
boot would be too tight, not too loose.
