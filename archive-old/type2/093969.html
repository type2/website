Subject: ISO; rear wheel drum 

Hey everyone....
i'm lookin to find someone that can help us out 
with a rear wheel drum, for a 70westie. 
we don't have much green energy on hand to throw 
down on a new one, at this moment. so i figured 
i'd try the list for some luck. 
please send me an email off of the list, if u 
can help us out. *SHINE ON* -Chris
