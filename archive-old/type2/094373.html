&gt; Had to  double check some stuff on the engine so i decided to take a
&gt; closer look at the plug.  There is a low resistance accross  two of the
&gt; pins that makes it look like a pick up.  with engine running i get a
&gt; vaiance.  Though i cant find a description of it it is acting just like
&gt; a magnetic pickup associated with crank sensors on newer vehicles.
&gt; some  newer vehicles also have the same type of pickup in the front

This is what the plug looks like.

I trace it to a plastic connector at the back of the engine going to the
flywheel.  It appears to be the same kind of sensor described in the
Bentley.  I can't read the part number but it starts with 113 so it must be
common.

&gt; pulley setup.  I suspect it was used to feed a  piece of equipment that
&gt; could check timing and dwell without using a light.  This would leave

I'd love to know how I can read this to find out when the flywheel is TDC
without the engine running.

&gt; hands free for  adjusting.  An old  siemens series tester  is  mentioned
&gt; but i cant find anything on it except a general  &quot;engine analyzer&quot;
&gt; description

Mentioned where? Bentley?
