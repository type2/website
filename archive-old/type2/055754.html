Subject: Need Help with VDO Oil temp Sender
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

I just installed a VDO oil temp sender and gauge.  I seem to have everything
hooked up right, but when I start my bus, the gauge slowly moves all the way
to the right.  I rechecked the connections and can't seem to find any problem.

Think I got a bad gauge or sender?

Suggestions welcome.
