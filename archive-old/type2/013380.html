&gt; The book seems to be a great how-to guide for the various repairs

uh, but to actually answer your question,  everything should be taken 
with a grain of salt:
Muir, opinions expressed on the list, etc.  Even if it's in the Type2 
Library doesn't mean that
it's 100% right.  It just means that in someones experience, they found 
that particular technique
to work.

Use your brain, and remember you learn by making mistakes.  At least 
that's what I keep telling myself...
