Subject: Re: Exhaust Coatings

Sorry for the late post, but I am a bit behind in my reading.

In July 1999, just -4- months back, I had a brand new Pacesetter one piece 
muffler coated with the aluminum high performance coating by a shop in 
Maryland.

It looked good when new (4 months ago), but the Pacesetter looks like it 
started rusting through the coating on the bottom, and the Pacesetter tail 
pipe is breaking off!!

The coating cost $70, but since the Pacesetter muffler lasted only 4 months, 
I think I blew it.

I now have my old, two year, rusty muffler back on my '78, and I will take 
it off later and repaint it with POR-15 HIGH TEMP paint.

Unless you have quality parts to begin with, save your money (and, more 
importantly, save your time and frustration) and paint with POR 15 high 
temp!!

BTW, I had my new heat exchangers touched with some POR 15 high temp paint 
2.5 years ago, and the heat exchangers are fine.

I used some NON high temp POR 15 on the (old) muffler and a new EGR filter, 
and that stuff burned off pretty fast.  On the (old) muffler, it burned off 
at both ends first, then gradually the middle of the muffler lost its POR 15 
(non high temp paint. I just had a bit POR 15 hanging around.)

The new EGR filter had its 6&quot; pipe eaten away, and I had to use 6&quot; of hose 
to connect the (old) muffler to the body of the EGR filter.  The POR 15 did 
not help the EGR filter at all.  I believe the 6&quot; of pipe was eaten away 
from the inside!!  Eaten away in two years.


If you still want, you can have your stuff coated by HPCoatings.  Just type 
hpcoatings in your URL and youse pays your money and youse take your 
chances..
