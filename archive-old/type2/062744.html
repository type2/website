Woodstock, NY VW Reunion:

It's in Woodstock, NY this Sunday September 8, 9am-5pm.  It's at the Art
Board Field junction routes 212 &amp; 375.  It looks like rain, but apparently
the show is still on.  You can call GASS HQ at (330) 382-1865 if you want
any additional info.  I expect there to be many buses (there will be 25+
show classes), but we'll see who shows up.  There is a campout at Saugerties
KOA the night before.  $5 admission.

How to get there:  

&gt;From the North: New York State Thruway (I-87) To Exit 20 ROUTE 212 WEST 10
miles to the Junction of 212 &amp; 375.

&gt;From the South: New York State Thruway (I-87) To Exit 19 ROUTE (?) WEST 10
miles RIGHT ON ROUTE 375.

&quot;Show at Junction of routes 212 &amp; 375 in the heart of Woodstock&quot;

Hope to see y'all there.  I'll be in a white on red '71 poptop Westee with a
white spare tire covered nose and a busboys sticker on my rear hatch.
