I didn't see that this post made it yesterday so here it is again.

I agree, you see far more shortened then stretched. But there have been
some stretched. The most impressive is Charlie Hammill (SP?) splittie limo,
WOW! But I lean more towards a bay stretch, ideally as long as possible
with an early westy on the front and a later westy on the back, opposing
pop-ups you know?

Anyway, this guy is stretching a Vanagon now, but he has a shot and
description of a bay he stretched in the past on his site. Probably a lot
of the info about the Vanagon stretch is applicable.
