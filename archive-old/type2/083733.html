&gt; Steve, you should add the word 'bay' in that sentence:

&gt; Vanagon headrests have thinner posts. Lately there are a lot of posts about
&gt; people putting Vanagon seats in late bays.

Whoops!  right you are!!  Vanagon ^= Bay!!!!

Any idea on the '72 with headrest mounts in the seat frames?  Were
headrests a rare option in '72 or did I get a bus with mismatched seats?
