Subject: Re.Backfiring,leaking oil

Daniel,

Forgive me if this has been answered to you satisfaction,I'm in digest
mode and always a bit behind...

 &gt;My bus backfires when I downshift from 3rd into 2nd, not like loud backfire,
 &gt;more like a....for lack of better term.....a fart.  What does this mean and
 &gt;if it's bad how do i fix it??


   Could be just a simple vacuum leak...check line to the carb for
   leaks and/or perished rubber bits...


 &gt;Totally unrelated is my Thing.  It leaks oil inside the engine compartment
 &gt;specifically like just to the left of the pully I see it collect on the tin,
 &gt;and down in the pulley area...I'm assuming it's the seal behind the
 &gt;pulley.....also it pours out oil when parked on a slant...is this indicitive
 &gt;of the pulley seal?  One VW guy said it was the oil cooler.

   Sounds like the one or both of the rubber seals under the oil cooler,
   not the cooler itself.
   Cheap fix,like a dollar or two for the seals but a bit of an PITA to
   access...you gotta take out  the  generator &amp; stand,fan shroud &amp; oil cooler
   to change out the seals.No biggie but takes a little time...

   In a Beetle,you remove the engine lid and can then remove fan shroud
   etc without removing the engine...in a Thing it may be just as do-able
   with the engine in the vehicle but can't honestly say for sure...

   Cheers,
