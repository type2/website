 &quot;im having trouble with that !_at_#$ woodruff key and the end of the

my
fan moves about half an inch back and forth.&quot;

I had the same problem with my 2L in a 74 Westy that I had.  I tried the
loctite and a few other things.  The edges on the groove for the
woodruff key had completely rounded out on the load side.  None worked
for over a week.  I just broke down and spent the money on a new crank
and rebuilt the engine.  The problem was compounded by the fact that I
drove home at one point and the fan stopped turning altogether.  I think
I drove on it in that condition for about 30 minutes.  Anyway, when I
removed the heads for the rebuild, I had some cracks in them.  So I also
had to invest in some different heads.  I'm not sure if the extreme heat
for 30 minutes cracked the heads or not, but I'm sure it at least made
the cracks worse.  The point is you should invest a little now before
the damage is worse.  The crank was about $120 outright and new crank
and rod bearings were about $50.  Good luck and have fun.
