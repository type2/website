Subject: Re: Electric fan cooling proposal

All I want to say is that the stock fan, by testing with dynometer, takes about 7
hp at 4500 rpm.  (my source was several magazine articles concerning vw dyno
tests in vw trends and hot vw magazines, they refer to over 10 hp at race engine
rpms like 6000)

You are therefore looking at matching that sort of power with your two electric
motors.  I think even a 3 hp electric motor on each side is too heavy and
impractical to power at 12 volts, maybe 10 amps each?

I remember seeing the cfm in one of the vw workshop manuals but don'at have it at
present.  I bet the cfm you are working with is too low or is for idle speed?

But if there is massive efficiency to gain from outside air collection, my own
theory is that it will require a duct to the front of the vehicle, forced air
feed to the system would work to reduce the current draw at high loads.

I hope it works out because this is a commendable project for research.

By the way, if the engine access limitation that frustrated you was the need to
pull the engine to replace the generator, I have a simple fix for that.   There's
a way to refit the generator without using two 10 mm nuts that attach it to the
backing plate, and under this method it goes straight in and out in the car, no
problems.  I posted this advice about a week ago

&gt; I propose to cool a 1600 dp type 2 vehicle with electric fans, and get rid
&gt; of the dog house fan shroud along with the sheet metal surrounding the
&gt; engine that seals the engine compartment.
