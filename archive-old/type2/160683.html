&gt; Happy Friday!!!
&gt;
&gt; That was one of the most exhilarating Lost episodes I've seen in a
&gt; long time!  At least 10 minute of bus air time!   Can four people
&gt; really &quot;right&quot; a bus?  How long would you estimate a pre-72 bus could
&gt; sit in a tropical forest, on it's side, and still roll-start? (And
&gt; tires retain air...and beer still be palletable..).
&gt;
&gt; Did anybody recognize what part the Japanese man was holding in his
&gt; hand while reporting that the engine wouldn't run?
&gt; Also, if someone can post a URL to the discussion thread on a
&gt; (probably more appropriate place) air-cooled forum that would be
&gt; appreciated.

&gt; &gt; From the previews, it appears that the TV series LOST will have
&gt; that  blue
