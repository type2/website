&gt; Speaking of this, I will have more of those genuine Hella dual battery
relay
&gt; kits that were so popular in about 30 days, coming on my next shipment
from
&gt; Europe.  As before, list member price will be $18.95.  I sold a ton of
these
&gt; to list members last summer.  They are designed specifically for VW and
&gt; similar campers, allowing both batteries to charge when driving and
&gt; isolating them when camping.  Instructions included.
