&gt; I have recently figured out that my 72 type-2 (still trying to find a

&gt; wearing?

This topic has been discussed quite a bit, and there is a section on
the web site about it, as I recall.

The correct size for all baywindows is 185R14, reinforced (or load
range C or D).  Do _not_ use standard load tires unless you like tire
failure at unopportune times (guess how I know this).  You will also
get much better handling with the stronger tires.

Some folks run 195/75R14, which are a bit wider of tread and a bit
smaller in diameter than the correct size.  Many tire stores will tell
you that this size has &quot;superceded&quot; the 185R14, mostly because they
don't stock the correct size.  I don't like to run the 195/75s, as the
engine spins fast enough without putting smaller diameter tires on it! 
Whatever size you get, be sure that they are rated to carry at least
1540 pounds each.

Reinforced (load range C or D) 185R14s are a bit hard to find, but they
are out there.  If you live near a Firestone/Bridgestone store, they
can get a Bridgestone RD603 in load range D, which is a very nice tire
for a bus.  Continental, Dunlop, Michelin, Yokohama, Hercules, and
others also make the proper size.  Dealers can order the correct tires
for you, but sometimes you have to twist their arm a bit to get them to
do it.  They'll pressure you to buy the tires that they have in stock,
but stick  to your guns and move to another dealer if you need to.

Have fun in your tire quest!
