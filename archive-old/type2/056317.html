Subject: door rattle

Hi List,

I love the new arcjive! Good one.

My sliding door rattles really badly (except on silky smooth roads, not
many around here), the seal is not good, but the rest of the door seems
quite solid (hinges etc). Is replacing the seal all that is necessary here?
is there something I can do about tightening the latch before it breaks up?

We all need a camping trip, but with another fresh one (3 week old girl, to
fill that first row in the back) we will be waiting for warmer weather.
I've now bought every child restraint device available, (except a
straightjacket ;-)).
 
Congrats to Ian Hallet, fellow Aussie, doin' it for Australia!, on the
successful rebuild, another confidence booster for when I start my own
'wonder what's goin on in there' experiment (I'll remember that elusive
13mm nut). 

Here are some scans of the treatment of early aircooleds in Australia's
blistering climate, just leave the engine in the air, less tin required, or
maybe it all rattled off (like my door wants to).

With all the busses I see each week, I am amazed how few Aussies are
actually on the list, I'm thinking of signwriting my bus. 

Thanks for the BW,
Darrell.
