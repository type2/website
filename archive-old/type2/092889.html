Subject: Re: [T2] This seems to be the answer re GL4/GL5 trans lube.

Electricity takes the path of least resistance - why would the oil be that 
path when the tranny case is an easier path?

Not knocking you, just poking around for answers.

&gt; &gt;Volkswagen went to a cheaper
&gt;BRASS  synchro ring.  Brass is an alloy of copper and ZINC.
&gt;Unfortunately,
&gt;in trying to save a penny or so per synchro, VW decided to use an alloy
&gt;of
&gt; &gt;brass that contained a significant percentage of aluminum.
&gt;
&gt;Interesting. With the 12 volt current grounded to the motor/transaxle
&gt;and body, and disimilar metals mating up in the gearbox, this reminds me
&gt;of the sort of electro-chemical corrosion you find in a marine
&gt;environment, usually mistakenly called electrolysis. When two disimilar
&gt;metals come together in the presence of an electrical charge, one of
&gt;them  is usually going to want to corrode, or be sacrificed (I think
&gt;it's the metal that conducts current best, but it may be the other way
&gt;around). On a boat with disimilar metals mated below the waterline
&gt;(props to shafts, say), one usually attaches a zinc diode, which becomes
&gt;sacrificial and is eaten away so the working metals will stay healthy. I
&gt;recall early aluminum-hulled racing sailboats in particular had problems
&gt;of this nature. All this makes me wonder whether the GL5 is just somehow
&gt;a better conductor of electricity, or maybe the GL4 a worse one. Either
&gt;way, somehow the zinc seems to have become sacrificial with the addition
&gt;of whatever was in G5 that was not in G4.

Ciao!
