Subject: Re: [T2] Where can i get Bar Oil?

Bar oil is chainsaw bar oil and can be found at most lumber yards or large
hardware stores.  I'm not a chemist, but there is something in bar oil that
fights rust.  Bar oil is also like honey and will stick to the metal.  Some
people use a spray gun that is designed to spray undercoating and coat the
entire underside of their busses.

When cars were built in the 70's to have rust pockets, an old body man told
me to drill small holes in the door posts and wheel wells and put oil in
there to fight the rust.  He was correct, it really will keep you bus from
rusting further.  You need to oil everything every fall.


&gt;I read about using bar oil as an undercoating in the type2 library, but i
&gt;can't seem to find a place to purchase it. Has anyone used bar oil, and
&gt;where did you get it?
&gt;
&gt;thanks
