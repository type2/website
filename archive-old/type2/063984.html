true air suckers have a thermostat, but it is less critical then on water
cooled vehicles. My bus get up to operating temp within five minutes without
any thermostat. Lets face it, 90% of type 2's have thermostats that are
useless.this is because water is something like twenty five times more
efficent at transferring heat then air. also air cooled thrermostats seem to
stick open (maximum cooling) while water thermos get stuck quite often closed
(a real pain in the ass).
