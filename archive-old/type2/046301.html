Subject: Re: [T2] Building a 1776cc, any tips?

I've recently built a 1776, and didn't find out till afterwards that the
nuts on the rods should be peened to keep them from coming off.  I read
this in a book, &quot;Rebuilding your Aircooled VW engine&quot; or something like
that. I don't remember the author's name...

BTW, mine's running great.
