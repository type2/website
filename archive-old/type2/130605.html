Subject: Re: [T2] engine noises that sound like exhaust

Hi Kyle,

If you have a 73-74 bus then you could be asking about the air 
injection (smog pump) ports. The plugs for these ports sometimes come 
out and the sound is nasty.

The #3 port on my 1.8L used to do this about every 12-18 hours of 
highway running time.

One more reason I love my 2.0L.


Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; it sounds like air being forced.
