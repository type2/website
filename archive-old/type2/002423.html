Subject: Rain Washed Away All My Good Bus Karma!

Hey Folks,
   If there is one thing I've learned over the years it's that there will be
days when nothing goes right, and it's just best to walk away and try again
later. This has been the case with my Westy for the last 18 hours. After
scratching up the sliding door last night trying to install the jalousie
window, this morning I decided to put the passenger door back together.
Well, after getting the vent window jammed in place and putting a couple of
scratches on the door, the black clips that hold the aluminum trim and
channel felt in place all snapped on me, 3 in a row! Those clips are prone
to break anyway. So, I decided to put away the tools for now and try again
another day. Also have some pictures of my new paint on my page, go to
&quot;Restoration Progress &quot; link at the bottom to have a look.  Jeff
