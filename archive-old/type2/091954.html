Subject: Re: [T2] Bus in the 4th of July parade

Make sure your engine is well sealed from air that can enter from below-
it's designed to pull cooler air in from the high vent scoops and indeed
should run coolest at idle.  You can ride in first gear; make sure idle
is not too high (around 800-900).  If doing a lot of stopping-starting
on flat ground, I wouldn't ride the clutch (keeping it in a lot), as
this is hard on both the throwout and the pilot bearing. Ya gotta stop,
pop it in neutral, let it out, and wait to pop it in, go to first, and
go.
