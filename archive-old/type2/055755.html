&gt; Hello Mark,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Haynes isn't (usually!) too bad.  It depends on who wrote it on which
&gt; &gt;make/model/year.
&gt; 
&gt; I am in the process of looking for a better repair manual for my '70 bus
&gt; too and I was surprise to see so much of comments from the Type-2 list.
&gt; Someone did recommended a repair manual called &quot;Shop Manual&quot;. Do you
&gt; have any ideas how good is a &quot;Shop Manual&quot;?

OK, my &quot;official service manual&quot; has been all I've needed so far. &lt;G&gt;

ISBN 0-8376-0092-8
VW parn no. LPV 997 288
Bently Stock No. V278
