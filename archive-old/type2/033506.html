&gt; From: Curtis Long &lt;jclong_at_jps_dot_net&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; For years, I've known about the Nokia Tires (now known as Nokian) from
&gt; Finland and their reputation for superior Ice and Snow performance.  I
&gt; have used and loved the Goodyear F32 &quot;Studdless&quot; snow tires for 3 years
&gt; and was ready to make my decision for new winter tires.
&gt; 
&gt; My Problem (same for most Vanagon/Bus 14&quot; wheel owners) is getting heavy
&gt; duty 14&quot; tires with the load carrying rating required by Vanagons and
&gt; Busses in the new special studdless rubber compounds.  Almost all of the
&gt; best 14&quot; versions are light weight passenger tires or are meant for ice
&gt; but not deep snow..   I needed both ice and deep snow abilities.
&gt; 
&gt; I made one last check to see if Nokia tires were anywhere around and
&gt; found out that Les Schwab Tires is now a dealer for Nokia!!!   ~AND~
&gt; Nokia has just released an 8 ply rated Hakkapeliitta 10 LT Snow tire in
&gt; the size of 185 SR14.   At least that's what the sales guy called it..
&gt; I wanted larger diameter tires, but he said these were a special size
&gt; that was almost as large as my BFGoodrich 8.50x27  TA All terrain
&gt; Radials..    Not sure if he was lying or not, but they are large enough
&gt; to satisfy me.
&gt; 
&gt; The tire claims to be a 185 R75 14 C with a max load of 1875 lbs at 65
&gt; pounds of air cold.   I added the optional studding (though these are
&gt; really studdless class tires) with the usual balance/stem charges and
&gt; tax came to $434.53.  Base price was $89.65 with studs.  $10 less
&gt; without.
&gt; 
&gt; I have already tested them in snow that I would not consider entering
&gt; with the other winter tires and was totally amazed!!   These tires have
&gt; all of the best qualities in one:  Heavy load capacity in a 14&quot; tire,
&gt; Aggressive snow tread with special rubber compound for ice, tall, narrow
&gt; and studdable.
&lt;snip&gt;
&gt; I figure if they save me a tow bill or body damage from a slide and
&gt; maybe even prevent the need for a winter search and rescue, these tires
&gt; are cheap insurance.   Just watch out for the guy behind you that can't
&gt; stop as fast as you.
&gt; 
&gt; Happy Winter Bus Driving!!

Curt:
I'd have to agree that having FOUR studded snow tires is a real
eye-opener! I've been using such a setup on 2 water-leaker Vanagons for
3 seasons now and have been really pleased. The difference between
having 4 studded tires and 2 studded tires is right up there  with the
difference between having 40 lbs of air and 10lbs! (It's a BIG
difference). Here in Iowa we tend to get only a few deep snows each
year, but because of the humidity it does not subliminate (okay physics
people, is that the right word?), but rather turns into packed, frozen,
ice-mud-salt gunk that stays on the road for 2 weeks or so.
If you decide to go with such a plan and buy 4 rather obscure tires, I'd
recommend you buy 5. If you ever ruin one, you may have a lot of trouble
finding another, and besides, it's always nice to have a spare with the
same characteristics.
