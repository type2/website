Hey all,
  I have been on this list for a while now and I have loved it. I have had
several Baywindows over the years and shared the fun. I now have had my 85
Vanagon for 4 months and do not think I will ever own another Baywindow. This
85 Westy is great. I am doing an I-4 VW Jetta 2.0l conversion to it right now.
I am on the Vanagon list and the Wet Westies list. I can no longer keep up with
the mail I get. (1000+ a week!) I can not read it all. So, I will miss all of
you and I have enjoyed the time, but I will be moving off the list. I can still
be contacted at the same addy: solomon_scott_at_yahoo_dot_com
See you all around.
