&gt; My 1.8 is leaking exaust from the joint between the head and the heater

Band-aids or Elastoplast, depending on whether you are in North America or
Britain.

Seriously, this is not that tough, *IN THEORY*.  In practice, tho, it's
usually a bear.

In theory:

You need to loosen the 4 nuts holding the heater box to the head and the 3
holding the muffler to the heater box.  Separate the muffler enough to
drop the box, pop the old gaskets out, put the new gaskets in place, put
the nuts back on the head studs, put a new gasket between the heater box
and muffler and bolt the muffler to the heater box.  Done!

In practice:

The 7 nuts you need to remove have been in place in a hot corrosive
environment for decades.  They have achieved total union with their studs
and they want to maintain that union at all costs!  In addition, the nuts
and studs have corroded to the point where  a 12 or even 11mm socket will
fit on what were originally 13mm nuts. Unless you have done this recently,
they are generally a metric bear to remove, and the access, especially to
the upper nut on the heater box-muffler connection, is impossible!

Once you have the nuts off, you will find that the box does *not* want to
slide down off the studs.  Why VW made the tolerances so tight on those
holes I will never know.

With the box finally off, you will probably find that the exhaust gas has
not only eaten the copper gasket, but has eroded a track in the flange of
the heater box as well.  OR

You will find that the problem is not with the gasket.  The gasket is
fine, but the top flange fitting has broken its welds and is stuck to the
head.

Tips:

The evening before you plan this job, get under the bus and remove the
deflector tins beneath your cylinders, then drive around for 15-20 minutes
until the bus is thoroughly warmed up.  Park it where you will be working
on it, crawl underneath it and hit every nut on the exhaust with Kroil
while they are hot!  Go inside, have a drink (your choice) and go to
sleep.  If you have trouble sleeping, go back out in a couple hours and
hit it with more Kroil.  The next morning, hit it with more Kroil (get the
feeling there is no max limit on this? :-) and start in on nut removal.

All is fair in nut removal. A set of cheap sockets and a set of inch
sockets are good things... those nuts will be all sorts of sizes other
than 13mm and you want the 6-point socket that fits tightest.

Before you put the socket on, take a punch and bang a bit on the nut (stay
away from the threads!)

Once the nuts are off, remove the heater box and the old gaskets.  Look up
there and make sure the seat is fairly smooth. Clean it with steel wool.

Look at the end of the flange.  Make sure it is flat and true, both to the
head and to the other flange on the heater box.  If they are not, then you
need to take it to a machinist to have the flanges trued up.  Also, if you
remove anything from the end of the flange, you must remove that much from
the shoulders or the connection will not be tight.

Coat the new gaskets with a spot of grease to hold them in place while you
are putting the heater box back in place.

If the box was truly impossible to remove, consider drilling the holes in
the flanges a size larger.

Tools:

good 6-point sockets
cheap 6-point sockets
american sized 6-point sockets

grease
Kroil

4 copper gaskets
1 heater box/muffler gasket

Worst Case:

If you have a loose flange on the heater box, you need a new heater box.
Re-welding is, alas, not possible (any contrary opinions are welcome)

If you break a stud off, *PLEASE* take it to a machinist immediately,
unless you are very very good at pulling broken studs.  Machinists hate
dealing with broken extractors and you will have to bear their wrath which
is not a whole lot of fun.

If you run into anything I have not covered, let me know... I have done
this (can you tell) and it is possible, even if it isn't a whole lot of
fun :-)
