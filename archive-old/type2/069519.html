Subject: Rocker Geometry Questions

Hi,

I'm in the process of re-assembling the 1500 from my wife's Type1 and I ran
into a head scratcher: I decided when ordering parts that the swivel-foot
rocker adjusting screws would be a good move. The set I got said all that
was required to do to compensate for the increased length of the screws was
to shim under the pedestals. In the kit were four shims (washers) measuring
.075&quot; each. That wasn't enough. If I shim a total of .175&quot;, there seems to
be enough clearance/adjustment range. My concern is the rocker geometry.
Who out there has BTDT? Would removing material from the underside of the
rocker arms be better? I looked at shortening the pushrods, but that
appeared that it would make angles worse. Any advice/opinions appreciated.
Thanks,
