&gt; Hi! I just joined this list and I was wondering if
&gt; anybody has had this need before. Several months ago I
&gt; bought a 1971 bus, but the key I have only works in
&gt; the ignition so I am stuck with a bus that has
&gt; unlockable doors. What seems to be the best way to fix this?

Remove the interior panels of the driver and passenger doors, then remove
the exterior handles.

Now, over a clean work surface (small parts can get lost), put your
key into the lock and then undo the screw on the back side of the lock
cylinder.  You can then pull out the cylinder.  The key will prevent the
&quot;pins&quot; from escaping.

Now you can pull the key carefully out of the  cylinder and then pull the
pins out of their slots.  The pins are actually little rectangular plates
with a hole in the middle.  There is a tiny spring behind each pin that us
usually held in place with ancient grease.  Clean all the little bits up
well.

Now you are ready to rekey the lock.  Start with one pin and install it in
its slot.  Put your key in.  Is the pin now flush with the outside of the
cylinder?  If not, try a different pin until you find one that works.  Use
the same process to fill all the other pin slots.  If you have a couple of
pins that don't fit you can leave them out.

Put the lock back together and you now have same-keyed locks!

The sliding door and hatch locks can be changed in a similar manner.
