Subject: Re: [T2] exhaust stud dilemma 

I know I will be flogged for saying this but I'll say
it anyway. To save pain agony and all those bad words,
pull the engine out so you can get to things to work
on it. you have already wasted at least 3 to 4 hours,
and the engine could have been pulled out in at the
most 1 hour, then another hour to pull the head off,
so you can get to the stud. take it to the machine
shop and let the pro pull the stud and replace it for
you. while he is doing this take this time to clean
your engine and tin, and get your gaskets and 'O'
rings for the pushrod tubes. Good luck with it. Phil
