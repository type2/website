&gt; It takes ~22ft.lbs (at the hardest spot) on the pulley nut to turn my

&gt; 22ft.lbs feels like a lot compared to before and I worry that I did
&gt; something wrong. Before the pistons/cylinders were installed, the
&gt; crankshaft assemblt and rods turned super smooh (of course).
&gt;
&gt; Key turning time or dismantling time ??

With the spark plugs installed you are fighting the compression of  
the engine so it's no wonder it's hard to turn especially with the  
piston rings loaded with oil as you describe.

Pull all 4 plugs and try turning the engine over. Use that feeling of  
rotating the engine to gauge your assembly skills.
