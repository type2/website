I think due to financial problems, i'm going to have to part with my baby.
She's a red 71 westy in beautiful condition.  Within the last 3000 miles she's
got:
new windshield w/rubber
new tires
new brakes
new clutch
rebuilt tranny
rebuilt engine
new CV's
new Ball joints

I'm not quite sure what to ask for her, so make offers.
there's very very little rust, just a few small spots of surface rust...very
small.  There's a small dent in the drivers door, but other then that the body
is perfect.
email me with questions or offers.
peace
dave

&gt;  	Who did the rebuilds on the tranny and engine...??
A professional rebuilder in Greenfield, MA...it was sent to them by Metrix
Auto in Northampton, MA
&gt;  
&gt;  	How extensive were the rebuilds...??
there was a crack in the case so it was replaced with one from I believe a 76
beetle (would that make sense?)  they put new seals, new bearings, new rods,
etc.

she's a california bus only in MA for a couple years...and she's never been
driven in the winter since she's been over here.
peace
