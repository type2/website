Barry -

You do have a stand-alone AC source there. Depending on the model of the
UPS, you should get at least 10 minutes of 115v, depending on the current
draw. UPS's are only there to allow a computer to shut down gracefully.

I think the bigger the battery, the more time you'll get. Try to find the
UPS's website and get the skinny on how many AC amps and time/current draw
you have.

Good deal on the AC inverter, though!

&gt; As the thing will run a desktop computer for
&gt; awhile on a tiny 12v cell, I see no problem. Anybody???
