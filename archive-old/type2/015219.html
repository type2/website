Subject: Unusual Intake
Mime-Version: 1.0

On my 1600SP, on the driver's side of my intake, I have about a 4&quot; tube
sticking up that has a cap screwed on it.  THis &quot;tube&quot; is welded to the
intake.

Has anyone ever seen this, or is it some homemade backwoods engineering
something or another ? 

Thanks!
Derrick
