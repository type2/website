Subject: correction

I did not mean to imply that the crankshaft main bearings or the crankshaft
to connection rod bearings are oil splash lubricated. I was trying to say
that the rings, piston, and cylinder walls are lubricated by oil splash in
addition to the oil spray that &quot;leaks&quot; onto them from the outside edges of
the oil pump - drilled oil passage- oil pressurized bearings.
