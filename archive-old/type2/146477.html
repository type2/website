Subject: Re: [T2] It just wont run

&gt;&gt;did you clamp off any fuel lines and forget to
&gt;&gt;unclamp them?


Actually I did, but I found it a few days ago.

Im still thinking that its a matter of low fuel.  I let the tank get
really down so that I would have less trouble if I decided to remove
it for what ever reason.  HA!  Like I'd have done that anyway.  It
seems that there just isnt enough fuel to get into the filter.

Well, Ill know this afternoon when i get home from work.

Dave
