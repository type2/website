Subject: Re: [T2] them city officials gives me blues


&gt;Anyway, I'm venting and I'm gonna have to stick it in my meager garage 
&gt;where it will take up all space.

Push it out when you need to work and push it back in when you are done.

That is what we have been doing with our '78 Westy during it's extended 
off-the-road-because-I-procrastinate-too-much process.

City regs are a real pain. We're in the regulation free county and hope the 
city stays over the hill where they belong.
