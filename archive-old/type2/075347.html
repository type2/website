Subject: '71 tranny nosecone refurb -- some queries

Folks, I've read the Nesstek piece* and scanned the archives.  Coupla questions:

1) Bentley is the only source for instructions &amp; photos?  (I gotta buy a-freakin-nother Bentley when I've got the early 60's beetle &amp; bus ones? :-)

2) Has anyone gone the route of just swapping out the whole nosecone with the Transform/Weddle late-model replacement &amp; steel ball?  Does the $50ish price tag 
include the whole schmeer, hockey stick and everything?  Seems like a deal -- but maybe I'm not clear on what parts/work the replacement thing eliminates the 
need for.

3) Seems like the inner shift dustboot is hard to find - anyone found one or had success using the shifter base boot as an alternative?

4) Anyone find a front tranny mount source?

General updates/disagreements/clarifications relative to this operation would be appreciated!

Thanks,
Joe

*The parts list at http://type2_dot_com/rvanness/transmis.htm puts the input shaft seal among the nosecone parts.  Doesn't it belong with the bellhousing parts?  Who 
edits that page?
