Subject: Question on exaust in cab.

        Re: flap valves, I've never seen one in good enough shape to be
functional.  I tore mine out and fabricated one out of a large size
aluminum dryer exhaust flap and lined the seal with cork.  Mounted it
further forward and away from engine and exhaust area.  Repositioned
control cable.  Works dandy.
        Re: testing heat exchanger for leaks.  It required taking them out
of the exhaust loop, but once they were out I made two wooden plugs (still
have 'em if anybody wants to borrow 'em, fine) Prior to installing the
plugs, I put two drill holes in one of them.  In one hole I put a bicycle
tire valve and in the other a tube upon which I fitted a balloon. I put one
in each end and sealed them with that acrylic latex caulk. (seals well and
comes off easy)   Once the caulk was dry I pumped air into the plugged-up
heat exchanger to fill the balloon, disconnected the bike pump and waited
to see if the balloon deflated.  Any leak would have deflated the balloon
soon after, but I opted to leave it a while (3 days) and no deflation
occurred, so my xchangers passed the test.
        Rather involved, but left no doubt in my quazi-intact mind.
