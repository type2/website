Subject: Distributor shaft seal

Does anyone who if that is what this Bus Depot part is?

   http://busdepot_dot_com/busdepot/details.jsp?partnumber=111905261

It doesn't really look like the photo of the seal in the Bentley manual 
(the one that sits between the clamp and the case), but I can't compare 
it to the one that came off my distributor, since mine is in maybe 8 
pieces (gee, wonder how long that seal has been leaking...)

Thanks!
