Subject: Re: [T2] Auxillary battery

Hi John,

On the &quot;United Empire Loyalists Fall Colours Tour&quot; and the run down to 
John Brown's Buses  my wife and I enjoyed the use of kid-distracting 
electronics. I have offspring aged 8, 10 and 12.

I purchased a cheapo 13&quot; $95CDN TV set from Walmart, and plugged it 
into my son's Sony PS2. Both were powered from a 400 watt inverter 
running from a spare battery hidden under the rear-facing seat behind 
the driver. We rented a couple of DVD's the kids hadn't seen yet and 
brought along a couple of games they like. The television is rated as 
drawing only 53 watts, the PS2 says it needs 375. I'd have to figure 
they inflate their power numbers slightly while the inverter would 
probably be under-rated. I built a small plywood stand that sits just 
behind the walkthrough and houses the PS2 and TV with room for movies 
and controllers underneath.

The inverter is behind the drivers seat, and powers a 4-outlet power 
strip mounted on the rear-facing seat. The power bar can be easily 
unplugged from the inverter and routed to shore power when it's 
available.

After about 40 minutes into our first roadtrip with this rig I remarked 
to my wife that it was amazing how the kids hadn't started whining 
and/or beating on one another yet.

The inverter did just fine for the first two hours, but sometime near 
the start of the second film the warning buzzer on the inverter started 
up. I connected the inverter to the buses 12V power outlet in parallel 
with the auxilary battery and things were quiet once again. Sometime 
soon I plan to wire in an inverter to isolate the alternator output so 
that the bridge wire won't be required.

We had five kids in the bus watching Sponge-Bob Square Pants on 
Saturday morning at John Brown's Buses, it was quite cute.

&gt; Hey Y'all,
&gt; This weekend I took a 4 hour trip in my bus with a 5
&gt; year old and a 12 year old. After I yelled &quot;keep your
&gt; hands and other body parts to yourself&quot; for about the
&gt; 90th time, I decided that I need to purchase a 12 volt
&gt; tv\vcr combo for these occasions.  I also have plans
&gt; of adding a gas heater.
&gt; So would electrical requirements for these things
&gt; dictate that I hook up an auxillary battery??
&gt; In the T2 library, found an article about hooking one
&gt; of these up, but the reading wasn't very
&gt; user-friendly. I will never have a need to run a
&gt; fridge off of this system, only small 9 inch tv\vcr
&gt; and a gas heater. Anyone have any advice about an easy
&gt; set up to do this??
&gt; So does someone sell a kit to add this, I need easy
&gt; install and clear directions.
