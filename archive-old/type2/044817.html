Hi Bob,

You're right, I would not reccomend replacing a manual with an automatic, but
whatever anyone else wants to do is up to them and I would assist in anyway I
could.

I was able to get the seals, o-rings, clutches, gaskets, etc., from a local
transmission shop.

What do you consider late model?  And the shop manual is really good?

I know my limitations.  I've rebuilt Chrysler TorqueFlights (Easy) 70 and 79 VW
automatics (Easy), Ford C-6s (Moderate), GM TH 200s, 350's, 350Cs (Moderate).  The
TH700R-4 (Too Hard) went to the shop after my first attempt and failure.

I am not familier with the trans you mention, does it actually use a vacuum shift,
or are you referring to the vacuum modulator ?

Keep smiling,

Mike
