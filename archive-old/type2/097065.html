Subject: Re: [T2] engine wiring - 76

Sounds like it could be the TDC sensor, which I believe is/was used for vw

&gt; I have a 76 bus, and found a disconnected wire in the engine compartment
&gt; recently. It looks to be nearly round, with three female connections
&gt; within. It is over by the battery, like it is coming from the factory
&gt; wiring harness..
