Anyone on the list going to the Show in Ennis on the 6th of May?

There is a samll caravan going over from here in West Texas, would love
to meet other list memebers there.

We are going down on Saturday, camping out at the Corps of Engineers park
on Lake Bardwell.


Hope to se any and all of you there.

If anyone has some good heads or even a good 1800 engine, I will be there
looking!!
