Having recently put together two Vanagon 2.0l engines I can attest that 
they have quite a bit of apparent endplay when the crank is loose in the 
left case half, and yes, it WILL affect your walk-out test.  The cam 
needs to be shoved back toward the flywheel end of the engine to perform 
this test or you'll get funky results.  My stand was at such a level I 
could push the crank back with my knee and hold it there while using both 
hands to rotate the crank.

&gt; Further question for the gurus:
&gt; 
&gt; I don't know why a new case would have this much endplay (1/8&quot; appearant with
&gt; case open) BUT since the case is open and no flywheel is installed AND my
&gt; engine stand kinda hangs the engine (not even close to level) would this
&gt; affect the walkout test? Should I put the flywheel and shims on?
