&gt;&gt; Incorrect.  Seat rails changed in '76.  I know this from
&gt;&gt; experience.

&gt;
&gt;BS, I have a '73 1/2 or a '74 front seat in a '76, the seat is the
&gt;early non headrest type with the big circle handle tilt back 
&gt;adjustment.I then used the frame from the origional bolstered '76 
&gt;in the '78. This is fact, the buses are within miles of my 
&gt;residence, could at a whim go swap the '74 seat into the '77 or 
&gt;'78 or '81.  Although the style of seat varies greatly the runners 
&gt;are compatible.

I should clarify that the change, from what I've seen, was late in 
'76 (perhaps for the '77 model year) - but I know for sure that 
there was a change.  My '78 parts van's seats would not fit my 
friend's '71.  He finally ended up bolting the '78 drivers seat in 
place because it did not fit the '71 tracks.  Also, at one time I 
had both a '76 and a '77 (manuf. 10/76) chrome yellow Westy, both 
completely identical buses in every respect except that the seats 
were NOT interchangeable.  I tried.  Looking at them side by side, 
the difference between the seat tracks was unmistakable.  Anyone 
else have any experience with this?  (Or care, for that matter?)
