Subject: FI hose clamps on sale

I located some sweet fuel injection hose clamps. I test fit them to some
Continental 7x3 hose and a spare fuel rail and they are perfect. They're
stainless steel and Made in Sweden.

I later discovered they are the same clamps that Kenneth Wilford sells in
his Vanagon 7x3mm hose clamp kits. He says, &quot;They work the best of any
clamps I have used. I have been selling them in kits for over 5 years now&quot;.

I bought them from Steve D'Gerolamo at Ultimate Garage. He still has 20 bag
of 50 clamps for $50 left and then they are gone.

Please tell him I referred you.
