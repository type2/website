	I ran one set of Michelins well past 70,000 miles
on my Rabbit- finally I noticed a vibration at speed... it was
the out-of-round tire defeating the shock.. worn down to the metal
belts and no longer round where they'd been ground off. A back tire
of course- on a FWD vehicle the rear tires get nearly no wear.

	Still, I take facts over opinion most days :)
