&gt; I've got a 75 1800 with factory air. Neither myself nor the PO have had it

yes they can be made to work, and they work much better than the stock
heat.

he understates the case

that belt is an absolute nightmare, if I ever catch the designer in a dark
alley he is dead meat!

needless to say the A/C is more good idea than actual fact. it works well,
but it is a real pain to keep working and the big problem is they really
suck power from what must be acknowledge to be a barely adequate engine.

in town acceleration is non exsistant, and on the road expect to lose
5-10 MPH off the top end and 2-3 MPG less fuel mileage.  also the engine
will run hotter.  

me when I used it I used it to cool the van down then shut it off, finally
when it broke last time I just pulled it out.  (if you need parts I kept
some around, as weights, so if you need em their yours)

good luck
