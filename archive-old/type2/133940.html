Subject: Re: [T2] Travel to Buy Bus

This thread is like a really odd echo.

&gt; She knew what I was thinking. I was calculating my odds of driving it
&gt; from Hungry Horse to San Diego with a minimum of three breakdowns, only
&gt; one of them catastrophic.

With so many milage numbers from &quot;engine&quot;, &quot;last rebuild&quot;, &quot;vehicle&quot;,
and mine: &quot;when the odometer was stopped for some reason&quot;, the only
real mileage that seems relevant is: Estimated maintenance free miles
before breakdown.  ..wonder how that compares to &quot;Miles and years
since last tune-up&quot;?

Gullible purchaser of &quot;2 years, 200 miles since rebuilt&quot;...&quot;Porsche
engine, ya know&quot;*...&quot;Holley's more powerful and dependable than the
old fuel injection&quot;, and &quot;Front brake sticks a little&quot;** ,20 miles
from home, and magic $1500 price tag, and &lt;snip/&gt; tires,.`ly yours,

Dean

If it weren't for this list and related community, it'd be dumped at
that garage sale where 4 different folks asked me if I was selling it.
:-P

Thanks for the muffler thread, btw.  I thought just becuase my muffler
was &quot;burnt orange&quot; ;-) I was due for a replacement.  It's not quiet
like modern cars, but you can easily hold a conversation while
watching it idle. :D

*Nope
**Translation: $500 job for the works up front. Stupid me: No estimate
or contract up front.  I don't think the number was horribly off, I
did get new parts and lines, but sure felt greased over...especially
when I found they didn't include emergency brake verification and fix.
