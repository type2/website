Subject: Re: [T2] Looking for 74-79 bus frame in SouthEast/mid east
  coast...

To who ever it was that bought the 72 bus body from me I don;t have your name 
and am tired of the bus still sitting here after 5 months . The point is you 
have to the end of the year to get it after which I'll give it away with no 
refunds to you . sorry to bother the list with this just hoping that whoever 
he was is on the list. Later and have fun  Mark Dearing Salem Import Service
