Subject: Re: [WetWesties] Aftermarket Oil thermostat/oil coolers - Long

Since the coolers were mounted in the luggage rack before i bought the bus,
and the holes were cut in the pop-top, I have no intention of moving them to
a better/different location. When the coolers were still hooked into the
system I had little plastic covers that i could &quot;snap&quot; into place that would
cover the coolers (not 100% though). I lost them during my spring break trip
last year down the Oregon coast in 75mph side winds (that was scary).

I had been contemplating aluminum or some kind of metal cover for the
coolers - but never fabbed anything up.

If you haven't seen where the coolers are mounted take a look at this pic:

(Above the windshiled) You can even see one of the coolers had the plastic
covers I lost

&gt; I've always been nervous about the reliability of oil thermostats and
&gt; prefer
&gt; to maintain full oil flow through the coolers.  Then I perfer to control
&gt; the airflow through the coolers by means of baffles or restrictors etc.
&gt; as a means of adjusting the overall temps during cool weather.
