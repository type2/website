----- Original Message ----- 
&gt;&gt; &gt; I've often wondered if those skylights (standee windows) could be put 
&gt;&gt; &gt; in a
&gt;&gt; &gt; bay....
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I've thought about adding similar features to my '80 Vanagon but don't
&gt;&gt; think it would work very well.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; ...a bay is close enough it might.
&gt;
&gt; now to find a bunch of windows in decent shape and some decent seals...


I had a  15 window bus that I was planning on making magnetic decals that 
&quot;looked&quot; like skylight windows..   over 20 mph,, I bet know one would know 
they wern't  O G
