Subject: [T2] fusebox/battery

Question #1:

I went to my FLAPS and I was flabbergasted when they told me, &quot;We don't 
carry a battery for a 76 Transporter, nor do I even have a listing for it.&quot;
Hmmm, so, to those of you out there with a 76 Westy (or otherwise), what 
kind of battery do you individuals recommend?

Question #2:
Has anyone ever tried to rig a second battery to operate say...radio, 
lights and other such things.  I was thinking of what to do while camping 
without city power.  I want to be able to run some interior lights, a 
stereo and a cigarette lighter (for a computer...I know, I know....) from 
auxiliary power, so as not to drain the main battery.  Also, how would this 
battery be connected so that it could be charged while driving?  Could I 
install some sort of switch...you know...park, turn of the bus, flip the 
switch...aux. power!

If anyone knows of such things OR could direct me to a web site...that 
would be glorious!

Thanks in advance!
Missy:)
