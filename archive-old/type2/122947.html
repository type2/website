Subject: RE: [T2] Propane heater

Just a personal experience with Propane units.
In my tree planting days we had Propane water heaters and in our
quest for greatness and glory in the bush we decided to create a
sauna with the shower. Silly us, We didn't separate the tent for the unit
(which normally would have had it outside the main shower tent) and
I was the first one back to have a shower that day before supper.

Don't even think for a second you will feel it and have time to respond
once you get short of Oxygen and CO starts to hit you. In seconds I went
from amazingly good to-feeling off. They found me with my shorts half on
laying half out of the tent.  I woke up strapped to the flat of a board in
a 1 ton truck on route to the hospital.  Note: I didnt walk out of the tent,
I luckily passed out and fell through the tent opening part way.

Rest of the story : My friend found me, worried that he was going to tell
my dad I was dead. If you knew my dad it would make you smile.  He also
had the decency to pull my shorts up the rest of the way before the female
treeplanters got to the scene &gt;phew!&lt; I did get a neat set of pj's from the
hospital though!

It hits HARD and FAST.
