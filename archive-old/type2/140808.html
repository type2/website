Subject: Re: [T2] Headlight aimers??

From: &quot;courtney hook&quot; &lt;courtneyhook_at_shaw_dot_ca&gt;
&gt; Has anyone ever come across a cheaply priced headlight aimer like you used
to see in the old days at any garage. They would suction cup it on to your
headlight then adjust your headlight to the correct specs?? All the ones I
see are 1000's of dollars!!

I found one at a yard sale or something a while back.  Never used it though.
I just found a convenient section of white cinder block wall and did the old
fashioned way.

I might try the thing just to see if it works.  I haven't seen them in
stores in ages.
