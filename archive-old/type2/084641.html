Subject: Nikki off to Atlanta!

Volks,

Nikki will be leaving Dallas this afternoon, heading out I-20 towards 
Atlanta.  If you see her red, highroof Adventurewagen give a wave.  I spent 
a good hour simply drooling over the marvelously straight and rust-free 
chassis (well, except for the deer-massaged nose which will soon be fixed) 
and nice paint on that bus.  Poor Bluto was jealous, paint-challenged as he is.

Her engine is running fairly well now although there are still some 
issues.  First of all I have to say I was impressed with how clean the 
engine was, and how many parts that usually aren't present in a bus like 
this were actually there.  Things like the little plastic cylinder in the 
throttle linkage and the heat shield above the muffler.

The engine felt sluggish and as Art had mentioned would not idle higher 
than about 800rpm.  Timing was to spec at about 7.5ATDC and vacuum lines 
were all hooked up correctly.  I checked manifold vacuum at idle and it was 
only ~7in.  Unhooked the vac retard and the idle did not increase like it 
should.  At that point I decided to remove the carbs and check them 
out.  The left carb had a 130 main jet and 175 air correction (73 
specs).  The right carb had a 127.5 main and 140 air correction (74 
specs).  The left carb's throttle stop was adjusted in about 5 turns too 
far and was never closing (contributing to low vacuum at idle).  The 
throttle shaft bores were a little worn and had not been rebushed.  I asked 
Nikki if these carbs had been rebuilt and she confirmed that they had (Hmmm 
#1).  Maybe when she gets home she can mention who rebuilt them so we can 
NOT go there.  It looks to me like they simply dunked them in parts cleaner 
and installed a couple of $20 gasket kits.  I synced the throttle stops, 
put 130m/140ac (140ac for extra insurance pulling hills) jets in both carbs 
and reinstalled.  Vacuum at idle up to normal, set idle at about 1000rpm, 
checked vacuum advance and retard (working).  Throttle response much 
improved, idled smooth, woohoo we're done!  Road tested the bus but it was 
still stalling on decel and by the time we got home it was &quot;chugging&quot; again 
at idle.

Sigh.  #1 and #2 were not firing at idle but appeared to be contributing at 
full throttle.  Classic symptom of plugged idle jet on right carb, but it 
wasn't plugged.  I knew those cylinders had been firing earlier because 
they passed the wire-pull test.  Basics first - got out the compression 
tester, #1 and #2 were around 60psi.  #3 and #4 around 125psi.  Rechecked 1 
and 2, now nearly 70psi.  Compression increasing as the motor cools.  Next 
step, check valves.  Suprise suprise, #1 and #2 exhaust valves have zero 
lash.  Probably held compression when the engine was cold but valves began 
not closing when the engine warmed up.  Backed them off and compression 
came up to normal.  Replaced trouble-prone idle shutoff solenoid with one 
from my parts box that had the plunger clipped to solve the 
dying-at-stoplights problem (gave up many years ago trying to get it to 
work right on my bus - once they get sticky it's game over).  When I was 
adjusting the valves I noticed that the left head had an unplugged hole 
under the valve cover meaning it was not a bus head but from some other 
type4 application (hmmm #2).  Right head did not have the hole.  My bus has 
those holes in both heads but I specifically requested them from MSHP so I 
would have lots of PCV.  I doubt Nikki requested it from AVP.  Anyway, I 
would have plumbed this hole to the air cleaner but the small pipe insert 
was not present so for now it is open to the atmosphere.  It needs to be 
corked (anyone up the road wanna volunteer?).  There is also a hole in her 
left cylinder cover (temp sender hole?  Maybe wrong year tin?) that needs 
plugging.  Replaced some questionable wiring, added a couple of hose clamps 
and then another road test, this time all is well.  We went out and had a 
nice, liesurely dinner then reset all valves when the engine was cold.

Overall I'm impressed with the resilience of this engine - it's still 
running well despite the best efforts of some non-listmembers who have been 
separating Nikki from her hard-earned money.  At least we got to visit with 
Nikki and her cat for a while, which is always a pleasure.

-David
