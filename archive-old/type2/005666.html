For a 90MPH bus I believe you are right.

However...  Ron Bloomquist's ROADCOW, a '71 poptop Westfalia powered by a
1981 Toyota Corolla 3TC engine, has been known to cruise comfortably at
80MPH for extended periods.

See    http://www.mcn_dot_org/b/roadcow/picts.html

Then click on &quot;Details of ROADCOW&quot; for how the conversion was accomplished
and how it worked out.

&gt;&gt;  In case you haven't noticed, the front of a Bus is shaped like a brick
wall.
In order to get a Bus to go 90MPH without straining the engine, you'll need
many hundreds of horsepower...so yeah, a Winston Cup race engine will
probably do it. Maybe.  &lt;&lt;
