&gt; I assume that that unit works on a similar principle to the

Thanks for all the cool info Ron. I could have gone out and actually 
read my manuals and stickers, but you saved me the trouble.  :-)

But something about the above two statements doesn't seem quite right
unless YOU are the &quot;P.O.&quot; who installed the Dometic a la Salvador Dali,
(or unless you were spending time and money messing with Koolatron while
driving around with an unused propane 'fridge already installed in your bus?) 

Did I miss something? 
Care to come clean on that count, or right the record for us? ;-&gt;

Thanks again for the info,
Surfer Bob
