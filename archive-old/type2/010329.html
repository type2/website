Now that we're close enough to get a decent weather report (see 
&lt;http://www.weather_dot_com/weather/us/zips/19534.html&gt;), it looks like it'll be a 
nice weekend, especially Saturday.  

Also, Blue Rocks tells me there's plenty of space for last minute folks.  They 
may give you a &quot;wilderness&quot; site with no power, but you can hang with us.  
They'll let us double-up if necessary.  So if you had plans and they fall 
through at the last minute, stop in for the night, just the potluck, or the 
whole weekend.

Remember that the caravan leaves around 10AM on Saturday, so if you want to be 
in on that (including picnic at Clover Hill Vineyards), make sure you're 
around.  I'll have caravan maps for those that need it.  

If you miss the caravan, join us for an afternoon hike on the Appalachian 
Trail, specifically up to Pulpit Rock.
