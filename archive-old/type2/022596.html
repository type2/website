hi
this is longish and probably not going to be if interest to 
those not in europe so you may which to delete now and save 
time, sorry... 

i know that the majority people on the list are from the 
states / canada and i don't recall seeing the statistics 
posted recently that say were we all are and what buses we 
all have,  but i know from the addressess that there are 
quite a few of us in the uk and other parts of northern 
europe. 

anyway after reading  about the exciting plans for the 
'great american bus trip' and also reading over the past 
year about the many other varied campouts and other shows in 
which list memebers from the states have met up with each 
other, i am feeling quite jealous that i live on the other 
side of the atlantic.  this is probably the first time (and 
probably the last) in my life i have had any desire to live 
in the &quot;great usa&quot; :) 

Although i have since i bought my bus, met many wonderfull 
people who also share the passion / madness that owning a 
bus brings, i have not met anyone else on this list.  There 
are often postings to the list from people in the states 
saying what shows etc are on and asking if anyone else from 
the list is going, arranging to meet up, and then after trip 
reports about what they got up to, what they saw, bus 
reports etc. 

 However  i don't think i have seen very many such posts 
&gt;from uk based list members, despite the fact that there are 
many summer vw festivals in the uk, and no doubt in other 
parts of northern europe within easy reach of the uk.

So i just thought i would see if we can at least try and not 
be so outdone by our non-european cousins.  Do you think it 
is possibe that we could meet up in any sort of way? Perhaps 
it is ambitious to attempt anything like their american bus 
trip, but it would be nice to meet up with some of you some 
time.

So is anyone going to any shows over the next few months? 
i know there is bug jam next weekend, for those who like to 
party, and also vanfest in september, both of which i will 
be attending, and perhaps the london to brighton run to the 
sun.....

any takers? 
anyone fancy meeting up with other european list members? 
 
i know that our first languages may not be the same but that 
should not be a problem, by way of illustration a tale : i 
have just come back from one month in france were i had a 
wonderfull final evening of my trip on a cliff top campsite 
in Fecamp, Normandy, spent in the company of 4 east germans 
who were travelling in a vanagon, who came over to my 75 
devon and asked in french if they could borrow a corkscrew, 
but later admitted they did not need the corkscrew they just 
wanted to look at the van. It's a quite stock 1975 devon 
conversion.

 Anyway to cut a long story short the evening ended with the 
east germans from  the vanagon, some dutch people with a 
eurovan, who had previously owned  a bay, and myself and 
partner, all sitting around swapping vw stories in a mixture 
of french, english, spanish and german.  (the complex mix of 
languages was a result of lack of one common language, the 
east germans had all taken russian as their second language 
at school and the third language varied with some speaking 
french, some english and some spanish, i speak a bit of 
spanigh and a bit of french, and my partner speaks a bit of 
german, the dutch people as usual spoke every language that 
exists to perfection :) (sorry Jan, but every dutch person i 
have ever met is wonderfull in 3 languages).  Even though we 
had no one common language we all had thorough inspections 
of our buses, and swapped information and tales.  And 
everyone tried to help get my fridge working but with no 
success... but a wonderfull time was had by all.  Three 
generations of buses, from three european countries, all 
enjoying the same things in life....vw busses, camping, 
(+good food +alcohol...)

i know it would have been even better to have met a 
splittie, and completed the whole family, but whilst 
travelling in france for a month i never saw any split 
screens, and only saw 4 other bays, but plenty of vanagons 
waved as they passed me.  I did not realise that older buses 
are not as common in france as in the uk, or perhaps they 
were all out travellin in other countries?  But the people 
in france certainly showed an interest in my van, as when 
ever i parked up, especially if the roof was up, i always 
returned to a crowd of people looking in the window, and 
taking her photo.  The problem then was  i had to be 
van-proud and always wash up and make the bed before i went 
off for the day...

Sorry for the ramble but the postings from the states are 
making me feel quite lonely, it am pining to get back out in 
the van and meet some like minded people.

I know that people *have* posted in the past about meetings 
in Europe and i am sorry that i did not attend, i realise 
that we are not as numerous as those in the states and so 
getting together may not be as easy.
i do especailly remember the posting about the meeting in 
Beddgelert, north wales, which i was really sorry that i did 
not go to, as i have been camping there before, it was 
february + snowing and i had to wear five pairs of socks and 
two sets of thermals but the scenery (and local pubs)  was 
worth the pain of sleeping in the van in winter.

anyway sorry for the bandwith, but let me know if anyone is 
going to bugjam next weekend, or van fest....

peace
