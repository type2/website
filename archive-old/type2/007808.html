Subject: transvair pics, did they work
Date: Sat, 21 Nov 1998 09:04:28 -0800

I was just wondering if the pictures I sent out to everyone worked and you
were able to download them, I know someone who e-mailed me and said he
recieved the file but could not read the pics.
                          let me know..............if so I will send in a
diff format....Keith
