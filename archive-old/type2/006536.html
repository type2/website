As I have had a chance to re-read the problem that Simon is having I
realized that my problem is less similar than I thought.

When I fill the tank the needle will indicate that I have a full tank. So
far so good. After approximately 50 miles of driving the needle will drop
the the empty position. Common sense tells me that the tank isn't really
empty so about 150-200 miles later I will fill it up. Knowing very little
about the world of sensors, wiring and gauges I am guessing that the problem
is with the sensor because of the relation to filling the tank.

Anyway, I need a new front axle beam much more than I need a working fuel
gauge.
