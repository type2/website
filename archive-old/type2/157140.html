Subject: [T2]drivers window replacement

my window has broken off the holder inside the door frame....

i can see how the slider comes out with like four 13 mm bolts but the window... how do i get it out...

the window is not broke it just broke off the slider it sits on... the metal frame on the bottom of window has rusted loose from the slider..
so i can set it on the slider but must use both hands to roll up and hope it dont fall off of slider... once hig enough in door though it will slide into place but at the top almost...

anyone know how to get the window out .. the slide is rocking loose.. so it surely needs replacing...i just cant get over how to get the window out...?

thanks in advance
chai
