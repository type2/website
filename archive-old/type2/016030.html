Hi all,

I had this submitted to me for inclusion on the commercial links page of the 
VW Type 2 Owners Club web page (www.vwt2oc_dot_org_dot_uk) but as it clearly says on 
the page we only do links for UK based companies but I though it might be of 
interest to folk on the other side of the pond.
Claims of uniqueness are rather exaggerated as these bumpers are still 
available in steel or Fiberglas, and price seems rather high....but if you 
want a bumper for a 67 to 72 then it could be of interest.

Good luck

&gt; To whom it may concern _at_ vw clubs;

&gt;  that makes a rear bumper for the same years as well. Anyway
&gt;  please see my web site,
&gt;  http://www_dot_users.qwest_dot_net/~baybusbumper for more product
&gt;  information. Also find cost and how to order if any of your
&gt;  members are interested.
&gt;  My e-mail baybusbumper_at_qwest_dot_com
&gt;  My phone #(503) 973-5080
&gt;   Thank you very much for your attention to this notice of a
&gt;  new vw product.
