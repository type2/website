Subject: Re: [T2] Corvair Notes

Hi John,

I guess that's a difference in the economics of wrecking yards then.  
Near here, if it sits for more than a few months they crsh it. A bus  
in a scrapyard here hasn't been sitting long enough for the engine to  
seize up. If it's there at all.

Happy trails,

&gt; No, east coast (Maryland). Anything from the 70s on back is not  
&gt; likely to have a usable engine.  I have three engines in my garage,  
&gt; a 289 Ford, Corvair, and a Mercedes 2.4 L diesel.  I should rebuild  
&gt; one of them as a learning experience.  I (we) must learn how to do  
&gt; this so we can keep all of these great old cars going.
