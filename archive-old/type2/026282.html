Alexis,

This normally happens when you take lots of short trips and the engine
doesn't get to warm up properly.  Next time you go for a good long run,
it should clear itself up again.
Dumping the crankcase fumes outside won't stop the gunk from building
up, all it will do is add to the pollution already emanating from your
exhaust.

&gt; The oil filler tube and tube going to the air filter contain some
&gt; funky gunk,tan in color(possibly f/moisture and oil mixing while
&gt; engine breathes).
