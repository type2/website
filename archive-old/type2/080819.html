&gt; Hi Bill
&gt;
&gt; the early buses didn't have that sheet metal panel between the engine and
the
&gt; gas tank,, and I have seen some early Bays without it also, I dunno what
year it
&gt; was installed for sure,
&gt;
&gt; If you have one,, or can get one,, you could put it in,, but Unless
someone
&gt; comes up with a serious problem with out it,, I don't think it matters,,,
ymmv
&gt;
&gt; But on the rag in the fan thing,, First thing I tell people who i see
leaving a
&gt; oil rag in the engine compartment is the dangers of it getting caught in
the
&gt; fan, and choking off the air intake, overheating,, etc!
&gt;
&gt; My Rule of Thumb,, DON'T carry the oil rag in the engine compartment!  and
if
&gt; you do put a screen over the fan intake,,, make it look like a french fry
&gt; basket, or a dome, a salad strainer,, not a FLAT screen,, cause the rag
will
&gt; stick to the screen and cause the same misfortune.

&gt; &gt; When redoing my engine I noticed that my bus (1970) did  not have a
&gt; &gt; &quot;bulkhead&quot; between the engine compartment and the gas tank compartment
like
&gt; &gt; is shown in the manuals.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Should I put a bulkhead in?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Also, a friend told me that his T2 engine once sucked up a rag from the
&gt; &gt; engine compartment.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Should I install a screen over the fan intake hole on the engine shroud?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks.
