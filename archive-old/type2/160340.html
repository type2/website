Subject: PDX air-cooled weekend?

For a few years, Discount Import Parts, The DDB and others sponsored a
VW weekend around a VW Burn at the Woodburn dragstrip.  The Friday and
Sunday events didn't happen last year, but I'm not exactly sure why.  I
think one of the key sponsors was doing something else that weekend. 
Anyway, I've seen that the VW Burn is on the Wet Westies calendar for
June 2nd, but I haven't heard anything about the rest of the weekend. 
Does anyone know if the other weekend events are happening?
For those that never heard of this, the Friday event was basically
grabbing burgers at a local non-chain burger joint.  The Sunday event
was a swap-meet.  At least that's what was done a couple of years ago. 
If there's no formal plan, I'll meet whoever at Giant Burger (same
place as 2 years ago) or any other agreed upon place on June 1st.  I'm
just trying to get the conversation started more than anything.
