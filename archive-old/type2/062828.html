Subject: Re: Advice needed for a 78' bus (fwd)

Get it running. Unless you're living in it, the cosmetics are secondary and
your budget should first go into the mechanicals (my .02). Besides, winter
is around the corner. If you're like me, you'll want it dependable by then.
No sense breaking down in the cold.
&gt;
&gt;I just bought a 78 bus for $400. It has a progressive dual carb rather 
&gt;than fuel injection so at least one thing is in my favor.
&gt; The transmission is stuck in second and 

Check the linkage. With any luck, something's come loose and jammed up and
you'll replace a screw and be on your way hollering &quot;Yippee!&quot;

&gt;the muffler assemble is in the back seat. There is some heavy rust on 
&gt;the corner front wheel well and holes on the steps.  But in general the 
&gt;body is whole. The help I need is trying to figure out where to start. 
&gt;Take out the rust on the edges or get the damn thing running. The engine 
&gt;does run but the CV are currently in the back seat. 

Do you know how to check the CVs? They should be tight and move through
their full orbit. Make sure they're good! Clean and repack them. Make sure
there's NO dirt or sand in them. My guess it they're out as part of the
intended repair for the tranny, which probably minimizes the chance that
it's just linkage. Still, for $400 in the bus, you can afford to replace the
tranny if you have to.

Oh yes the heater 
&gt;pipes are missing under the body. 

If you get these at a junkyard, be sure there are no leaks. The leaks cause
CO to get in the cab, killing you or causing brain damage...okay, you'd bail
out before it killed you, but if you're like me, you need all your brain cells.
