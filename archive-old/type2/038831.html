Subject: Re: Camping Stool Needed

[...]

&gt; Hi Folks, I need the camping stool, that fits between the front seats, for
a
&gt; ' 78 Westy. The green plaid would be nice, but I'll take anything, as long
as
&gt; it's in good shape.

I am sure both of you mean the storage box/stool that sits between the front
seats. Be warned that there are 2 different ones. The difference is in the
height. 74-75 is 11 1/2&quot; tall. 76-79 is 14 1/4&quot; tall. The reason is: 76-79
seats sit taller because the passenger seat swivels. The correct box will be
the same level as the seats. Both boxes have the same side dimensions: 11
1/2&quot; x 13&quot;.
Good luck finding one with the original yellow plastic covered trash can!
