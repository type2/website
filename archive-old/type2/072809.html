Subject: Need '78 crossover pipe

Greetings all:

A relative recently purchased a nice bus (thanks Jerry) with some kind of
cheap extractor system on it.   He is trying to restore the exhaust back to
stock and quiet this thing down.  He needs everything that extends from the
heat exchangers to the elbow.  I know that this includes the crossover
pipe, but is there another pipe between the crossover and the elbow?

If anyone has a used crossover pipe in good condition, that they would like
to sell, please pmail me.

Also, Ron at BD, could you please pmail me with your pitch and pricing for
converting to this to the earlier/'79 federal exhaust system.

Thanks,

Tim Woenker
'79 Westy
