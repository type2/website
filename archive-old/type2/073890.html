Subject: Re: [T2] Propane Heaters

Which type are you talking about?  I have a Mr. Buddy and have used it for
over a year now and really love it.  For extended use, buy a long rubber
extension hose and a 5 lb. bottle of propane.  Filling the big bottle will
cost about what 2 small bottles cost and you won't have to change out the
small bottle in the middle of the night.  In dry and cold areas, the propane
heater will put some needed moisture in the air which is an added bonus.

Used my heater last weekend for 2 nights in temps down to 25F, had to run it
on low because it works so well.

&gt; I'm considering buying one of the new portable propane heaters designed for
&gt; indoor use (Comes with a low oxygen shut-off sensor) has anybody tried one
&gt; of these? Afre they safe to be used in a bus. I checked the archives but
&gt; didn't find anything  about these particular heaters. Thanks for your
&gt; opinions.
