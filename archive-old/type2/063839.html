So BUDWIL_at_aol_dot_com says:
&gt; After seeing some of the older model type IIs at the VW Jamboree in Costa
&gt; Mesa this weekend I had a question concerning license plates I hope someone
&gt; could answer.  I saw quite a few vehicles with the original (black on yellow)
&gt; California license plates.  Did these people just get increadibly lucky and
&gt; purchase their resto projects with the original plates?  Or is there a way to
&gt; go through the DMV to get the original plate re-issued?  It seems like

I think it comes down to which DMV you go to and whether or not the parti-
cular clerk feels like doing the paperwork or not.  You need the plates
with the sticker on it for the same year as your vehicle.  If you get
a clerk that says the you can't do it, then come again some other time
and try to get another clerk or go to another DMV.  Persistence usually
pays off, but I think it's pretty lame that the people who are supposed
to be working for us, can get away with some of the bullshit they do.
