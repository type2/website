Subject: CHT sender location (was my weekend with Lurch)
To: type2-digest_at_lenti.type2_dot_com, mldwyer_at_saber_dot_net, TRGundlach_at_aol_dot_com

I am just now getting to reply to e-mails and such since my trip to the NC 
mountains.  The trip went without a hitch.  The music was great -- the place 
was great -- the place was great.  A good way to spend the weekend (and a 
birthday present) all around.

Anyhoo, you may recall from an earlier post that I moved the location of the 
CHT sender from underneath a &quot;stud&quot; just above the #3 spark plug.  I was 
getting maximum readings of about 350 (under load) before the sender broke.  
While I had the engine out, I had the heater boxes welded up tight (no leaks) 
and I had a stud welded onto the side of the exhaust pipe just downstream 
from the #3 exhaust port.  Now my cruising temp is 400 and my load temp is 
450+  This is when I'm pulling a 3% grade in 4th at 60 mph (about 3300 RPM) 
towing a small trailer.

Overall, I'm happy with the performance.  My oil pressure light does not come 
on at idle (PSI used to 5, now it is 7).  I put a new (used) head on the left 
side, and although I haven't tested the compression in #3 yet, my vacuum 
gauge reads a steady 15 at idle (without oscillating).  I still have 
backfiring, but I did notice a small leak at the downstream end of my 
(Thunderbird) muffler.  I painted it black (with Barbecue paint) before I put 
it back on, so now that leak may not be so visible any more.

Thanks for the bandwidth.
