Subject: re: No title for my bus

In some states,you can take the VIN number to the
local police or DMV and ask them to check to see if it
is a stolen vehicle.  Getting a title replacement can
be a pain in the neck (I've never done it, but have a
friend who did) but can be done.  I'd call the local
police department and check into the process if you
are ever thinking of buying a vehicle without a title.

Of course if the seller runs in the opposite direction
if you mention doing this, you can suspect something
is wrong.
