Facts count, memory is falable. If you write facts down they become data
which is vastly superior to memory, if accuracy be recognized as valuable.

&gt;&gt;Yesterday...seal replacement...oil was clear as new.  Transparent.  changed 
&gt;&gt;last month.
&gt;
FRAM / AC Delco filter

Use Mann or VW filter. Not optional. Check the archives. All kinds of
problems with this motor and most other brands of filter. It has some
special provisions required by your particular motor. No one has yet
verified that any other filter meets specs. Many can be easily identified
as not having these provisions. 

&gt;&gt;This morning, easy drive....13 miles.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;checked oil...oil is DARK, not clear....oil in pushrods BLACK...did not
&gt;drain pushrods. I should have, though.)
&gt;
&gt;Good procedure to fill the pushrods with clean oil on assembly. Provides 
&gt;lube to valve train MUCH quicker upon initial startup. They just need to be 
&gt;checked for blockage and cleaned.
&gt;
&gt;*** Yes, I now understand the importance of refreshing the pushrods on 
&gt;reassembly.  But I kept them mostly flat, so not much oil leaked out.
&gt;
&gt;*** I pulled 8 decent pushrod tubes from a spare '77 2.0 liter engine, whose 
&gt;history I know.  I blew out each of the aluminum pushrods, and saw the oil 
&gt;in 7 of them.  One of the pushrods was just plain dry. No oil inside.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Check your valve gaps. If one of them has
&gt;had poor lube it will be wide from excess wear. That's not likely 'cause
&gt;long before full blockage she will start tap tap tapping at ya in a few
&gt;miles.
&gt;
&gt;**  I have a '78 hydraulic lifters 2.0 liter engine. I guess I don't gap the 
&gt;valves.   

Right, but if you pull the rockers to replace the PRT seals, they must be
set up to spec upon assembly. People have been trying variations upon spec
setting for resolving percieved problems. Read the Bentley procedure, then
ask Boston Bob about variations. 

This is the third time in 8 months for the pushrod tube seals 
&gt;replacement

I suspect the new seals are being damaged as they are forced into place
during assembly. They are very easy to tear. Required: everything must be
clean, yes, you have to clean all the grundge off from around the holes in
the block. The bores for the seals must be pristine and bone dry.

Use silicon paste (SylGlide). Put a thin film on the seals before you put
them on the tubes and wipe a thin film on the bores in the block and heads.
Position the tube in preparation for installation and push it resting
lightly at the top of the bores. Eyeball the seal at the head end at the
top. As you apply pressure to push it in watch out for that seal to hang
and start to pinch. 2 out of 3 will fight you. Use a small screwdriver to
tuck the seal into the bore as you apply pressure and it will clear and
push down to the seat nice and smoothly.

&gt;1. Adequate change interval (detergent package never overloaded)
&gt;
&gt;***  No, I religiously change every 5,000 miles, both filter and oil.  I use 
&gt;Castrol nondetergent, but I don't kill/hurt the engine.
&gt;

The only way a 5K interval can be adequate is if the use ensures that, in
the main, every time you start the car you drive long enough to get the
motor to full operation temperature and keep it at that temp for at least
20 minutes. It takes that long to drive all the condensation out that comes
from overnight sitting then the initial warmup cycle. If you drive 3 miles
to work and back every day, you should change your oil every 4 to 6 weeks,
because the volume of condensed water will overload the detergents in the
oil very quickly. Once they are overloaded the varnish buildup in the
crankcase and throughout the lubrication system begins. 

&gt;Tell us of your change interval over the last several years, or since the
&gt;last motor assembly, and the type of use, commuting distances, ect.
&gt;
&gt;*** Engine has 140K miles, I talked to three of the four previous owners.  
&gt;Never rebuilt, but real clean and nice. I changed at 5k miles for the past 
&gt;45K miles I have owned it.  Commute 13 miles oneway. 

The best way to change your oil is not by milage. It's by inspection. If
it's changing from brown to black, change it BEFORE it gets black. (Note:
Does not apply to diesel) If you change the oil and it is black after a few
hundred miles, it is proof that the varnish build inside is bad. The fresh
detergents at the oil change dissolve this contamination and load up
quickly. Then for the next 4500 miles you building up more varnish 'cause
the detergents are full and the contaminants got nothin' to do but become
varnish and stick to all the surfaces.

&gt;
&gt;***  OK, here is the bad part.  I was using/will use the AC Delco PF13, 
&gt;listed for the 2.0 transporter.  However, since this was difficult to get on 
&gt;and off because it touches the heat exchanger, I looked for a smaller 
&gt;filter.  I bought the FRAM PH2870A, used for the rabbit and other minor VW 
&gt;vehicles.  The FRAM was the filter that had all the BLACK oil in it.  And 
&gt;this was my second use of the FRAM.  After seeing the BLACK oil, I put on 
&gt;another AC Delco PF13.

All your filter problems will be resolved by the OEM filter.

&gt;
&gt;Type and weight of oil?
&gt;
&gt;***  Castrol 10W30 (I know, it is recommended to go to a 20W40 or even 
&gt;20W50, and I did, just a year ago.  But, after a while, I came back to 
&gt;10W30.

Use spec weight oil per the owner's manual. Use the temp chart to select
the optimum weight. Use only the manual recomendation, not what someone
said in some e-mail or what Dad used in his Oldsmobile. Someone and Dad
don't know squat compared to the Neandereers who designed your motor.
Neither do I. My knowledge tells me, do it like THEY say. I've been doing
it their way for a long time and will report that the results are
AUSGEZEICHNET. 

&gt;
&gt;Before the leak, rate of oil use?
&gt;
&gt;*** Before the leak, and if driving 65 MPH and below, the oil use was maybe 
&gt;1 qt/2,000 miles. If pushing it at 70 MPH, even for just a few (like 50) 
&gt;miles, I went down a 1/2 quart.

1 qt in 2000 is within spec. 1 qt in 100 is not. This is indication of
wear, likely at both the valve guides and rings. If compression and
emissions is in spec, continue use but don't push it 26 miles per day. In
either case, monitor the oil level and record the addage and milage. You
can then review this history and know if the rate goes south.
&gt;
&gt;How long since you pulled the screen and had a look? Look and tell us of 
&gt;anything good, bad or ugly.
&gt;
&gt;*** Probably pulled the screen twice; once when I got the Westy in August 
&gt;1995 and it had pretty much 'some' shavings.  Shinny, with some gritty 
&gt;black, 

That gritty black is carbon. It is created when the varnish build up on the
back of the pistons gets everything baked out of it except the carbon.
Eventually, it starts to breakup and fall out with much potential to score
cylinders, clog screens, and jamb up oil pumps and galleys. Proof positive
than oil change interval has been inadequate for many many miles. If change
interval is adequate, the inside of the crankcase will be as clean as the
day it was assembled at the factory. Clean crankcase is spec throughout
operation life, BOTH the inside and outside.


 'death rattle' coming from the fan 
&gt;at the rear of the engine.  Also a little sloppy fan belt, and the 
&gt;alternator was shaking as the engine idles.

Loose bolt and or broken bracket. You could be within a days commute of
failure here. Fix this ASAP. Do not rev the motor. If it's just a loose
bolt and you continue to drive, the vibration will break the bracket
quickly. Plan to replace the belt. The vibration is hard as well on that
very expensive alt. Think how the bearings are being loaded back and forth
and back and forth. What does a gyroscope do when you try to wiggle it
quickly back and forth? It resists=loads the bearings.

&gt;
&gt;There is only one way I can think of that the oil in the crankcase can be 
&gt;transparent clean and the the oil in the filter is black. No flow through 
&gt;filter. That's why I said check the bypass plug.  But it would also mean 
&gt;that the last oil change you never changed or drained the black oil????????? 
&gt;You didn't leave that part out, did you? No, of course not.
&gt;
&gt;*** No I change oil and filter together.
&gt;

Put an OEM filter on there.

&gt;***  But my oil turned DARK (not BLACK) during my ride to work this morning. 
&gt;  I went out to check the oil level and I was really surprised to see the 
&gt;oil on the dipstick without having to get the light reflected through the 
&gt;oil.

Proof posative of varnish buildup from inadequate change interval. Stop gap
wizbang is to drain and refill with a quart of Risalone or Marvel Mystery
Oil (any FLAPS). Run the motor 50 to 200 miles, drain hot. Idea is to
disolve a whole bunch of varnish and crud with a big detergent boost then
drain it out and viola, clean motor inside, valves stop sticking, piston
rings reseal, yadayadayada. Won't work if you drive 3 miles per day till
you hit 50. The 50 to 200 miles must be ONE DRIVE, not 10 miles each day
for 3 to 20 days.

Reality is, (not too likely but nevertheless possible) 1. a chunk of carbon
will come loose and get jambed between the piston and cylinder and score
the hades out of it and you will loose that cylinder compression. 2. many
chunks of carbon will foul the screen, oil pump, galleys, pressure and
bypass valves. 3. The load of varnish particles and chunks will clog the
oil filter and your on full bypass sending a heavy contaminant load to all
things designed for clean oil. 4. a bitsy piece of carbon will fall from
the back of the intake valve and get mashed by the valve &amp; seat which
unseats the valve and you lose compression or burn the valve if it should
happen that one gets caught on the exhaust valve seat or just bangs around
till it scores the cylinder from the other side.

Even without the stop gap wizbang, any of these things can still happen
with a contaminated system.

Your problems are explained by. 1. Non spec filter. 2. Non spec oil. 10/30
is a later day spec for later motors. It might be appropriate in winter
Wisconsin, but not more temperate zones.
20/50 might be approriate for Arizona summers. Check the manual. Temperate
zones shuld use 10/40 or 15/40. 3. Interior wear from contamination. 4.PRT
seals, either the bores are scored or the seals are being damaged at
installation.
