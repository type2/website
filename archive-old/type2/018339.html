Bus Boys,

I contend that gauges make me less aware of my engine's health. To think the 
opposite is an American
phenomena, and it also the position that usually promotes Air conditioning, 
radios, electronic ignitions and
other creature comforts that have been known to sell alot of american cars. 
it's the american way.

Therefore, I am against guages because they will make **ME**  lazy and out of 
touch.  Not for everyone, but 
definitely for me.

my .02 cents

Chris
