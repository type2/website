Subject: Re: [T2] Rebuild steering box? 

&gt; Is it possible to rebuild a steering box? I have an
&gt;original 72 steering box out of my van, which needs
&gt;to be replaced. Can it be rebuilt?

&gt;&gt;The amount of resistance they want to you measure is
&gt;&gt;in inch pounds, so you'll need to devise a system to
&gt;&gt;measure inch pounds of torque. Torque wrenches in
&gt;&gt;this range run around $300 when I checked.

I bought an inch pound torque wrench at a FLAPS the
other day for about $25. It was a beam type but I
think plenty accurate for bearing preload adjustments.
