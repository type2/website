Subject: Re: [T2] Tire shop apes broke my bus (long)

Jason,

Sorry to hear about this :-( 
I also have a horror story about full-serve gas stations. DON'T USE THEM 
or if you have to watch the person filling your bus like a hawk.
Over in N.J. everything is full-serve and so these guys go to fill out 
my tank. They can't quite get the nozzle into the filler hole and so 
decide to jam it in which winds up ripping the rubber filler elbow. Gas 
everywhere.

I guess the moral of the story is that no-one, even if they are getting 
paid, is going to care about your vehicle as it were theirs.

Good luck with it!

Cheers,
Harry
