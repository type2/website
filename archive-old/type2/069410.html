Hello.

What characterizes a Westfalia? 
I had guessed, long before I actually knew
anything about VW (Engine's in the BACK?),
that it referred to the popup tent, and that
it was some kind of aftermarket thing, thus
the non volkswagen name.  I assumed it was 
an australian deal.  

Well, I'm wrong.  So what's the straight dope.
Why are some busses &quot;campers&quot; while others are
&quot;station wagens&quot; and &quot;transporters&quot;?

What are you looking at when you say &quot;That one's
a westy.&quot;
