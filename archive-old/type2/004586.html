&gt; I just read the post &quot;AM engine code&quot; and am wondering. My 70 Westy,
1600sp,
&gt; 009 distributor runs on sometimes. I thought I had the timing set to spec,
&gt; left notch in line with engine case line at 900rpm. Am I too retarded  (be
&gt; kind) or too advanced if it runs on? And which is which,: should the notch
&gt; be more to the left of the case split for advance or to the right? I have
&gt; not put a lot of miles on this bus yet, but it seems to run OK.

For some unknown-to-me reason, 'run-on' has been associated with
timing.....not sure why.
Run-on is actually 'dieseling'. You have fuel, you have air, you are short
on spark except for the heat from the hot cylinders. If you look at a diesel
engine...they have fuel, they have are, but they do NOT have a distributor.
They fire from compression.
Look at newer carbs like 34pic...they have an idle solenoid on the side. It
stops dieseling by shutting off idle fuel.
The correct fix for run-on when you do not have an idle solenoid is = lower
your idle speed!
If your timing is set to specs....leave it alone....it is not your problem.
900 is too high.
