Bob Hoover tried this back in '96. Here is one thing he wrote about it:

Subject: Re: LPG powered air-cooled VWs

Additional comments:

Air-cooled VW's powered by LPG have been featured in the VW-specific
magazines.  Information on such conversions is available from a number of
sources.  The Industrial Engine Division of VOA offered LPG-powered engines.

Despite a number of on-paper advantages, conversion to LPG has proven
impractical for the majority of VW owners in the western United States for
two reasons, non-availability of LPG, and the size of the tank needed to
achieve a practical driving range.

LPG tanks are pressure vessels similar to the propane tanks seen in rural
areas.  The lower energy content of LPG dictates the need to carry twenty or
more gallons of LPG to achieve the same range you would get from ten or
twelve gallons of gasoline.  Fitting such a large pressure vessel in a sedan
makes the back seat unusable for passengers and raises the vehicle's weight
by a significant amount.  Use of a smaller tank ties you to the vicintity of
the fuel source. 

Canada has addressed the problem of LPG availability in a more intelligent
fashion than has the US, with LPG available at nearly every service station.
 But for the forseeable future the use of LPG-powered vehicles in the western
United States is only practical in those areas where LPG is readily
available, which as of summer 1996 means metropolitan areas only.

Last thing I heard: he gave up because of the size of the tank needed.
