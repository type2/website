Subject: Re: [T2] Overheating

Thermostat flappers open?

Clogged carb jet?

Timing?

Missing tin or rubber?

Did you tear down the engine (split the case)?



&gt;I have a 1970 van which has developed a strange overheating problem. Last
&gt;Summer I completely overhauled the bodywork and removed the engine for a
&gt;clean, new wiring and new set of gaskets.
&gt;Ever since, I have had a problem with the running of the van after about
&gt;one hour of running. The revs will suddenly drop right off, sometimes cutting
&gt;out but often just idling. I have to pull off the road very quckly. The 
&gt;accelerator
&gt;pedal has no effect on revs. If I turn the engine off and wait 10 minutes,
&gt;she will get going again and run for approx 45 mins. Same deal, 10 minute
&gt;wait and off until the running time and waiting time are the same if not
&gt;worse.
