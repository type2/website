&gt;Oh, experienced ones,
&gt;
&gt;I am looking to convert my 74, 1800cc stock dual solex setup to a fuel
injection system from a &gt;79 non-California and was wondering if anyone has
any experience on doing this.  Basically, &gt;what components will need to be
replaced?  The following is what I have come up with as far &gt;as what will
need replaced:
&gt;
&gt;1. Heads
&gt;2. Intake manifolds
&gt;3. Fuel pump
&gt;
&gt;I also think that I would either have to replace the fuel tank or at least
modify it.  Is there &gt;anything that I have missed or overlooked?  If anyone
has done this before, I would really
&gt;appreciate some feedback on what was involved.

Ed,
I think others have answered most of your questions, but I just want to
clarify one point - you do not have to replace your tank - but you should
modify it. However, no welding should be required. The fuel rail circulates
gas from the tank back to the tank. This provides a constant supply of cool
gas to the injectors. This is very important in that it avoids vapor lock
which may occur in hot weather if the return line is just plumbed back into
the source line. A friend put FI on his '72 and had just this problem with
the 'loop' type of plumbing. His solution was to drill a hole and attach a
copper fitting to the top of the tank - near the sender unit so he could
thread a nut on the inside. Obviously care need to be taken when drilling in
a filled gas tank. This also requires cutting an access hole above the
sender inside the bus. Another method might be to plumb the return line back
into the fuel filler neck.

You may find more info regarding this issue in the archives.

When I helped my friend convert his '72 to FI we had it running the first
day. I wouldn't expect a conversion to go this smoothly, however.

Good Luck!
