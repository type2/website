I have used these for years, but only on smaller cars. They are very good,
but to lift a bus &amp; have it roll in a CONTROLLED manner is going to be VERY
difficult &amp; the stress on the chassis is Mega! Also I don't think you could
get it back up again! So I would NOT recommend these for busses, bugs yes
but not busses.
