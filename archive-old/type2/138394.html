Subject: Things I wish I'd done/thought to do

1. The nose on my reconditioned crankshaft is pitted. I didn't notice 
that until it was far too late to exchange it. Wish I had.

2. I had Adrian press the gears off my old crankshaft and swap them 
onto the new one. In retrospect, I'd rather that I'd had him press them 
off, then bring them home and clean them up before trying the 
gear-in-boiling-oil trick to put them back on myself.

3. I should have cleaned up the dishwasher rust on studs before putting 
the case together. It isn't going to make any difference, but it's 
evidence of impatience.

4. I put the camshaft end cap in with Permatex, as I hadn't yet seen 
how easy it would have been to do it with the Loctite. Here's hoping 
the two sealers don't interact in any bad way where they meet.

Having used it now, I am impressed with the Loctite. It's the way to 
go. Thanks Scott and Michael.

5. Another inch of clearance between the flywheel end and the engine 
stand would be helpful.

Geez, it's just a gall-darned engine [he says, without any conviction 
in his voice].

Oh, and a trick I discovered for putting head studs back in: coat 
threads with sealer and then start threading the stud in. When is 
starts to show some resistance, toss a nut from the bearing bolts on 
the other end and turn with ratchet. The nut and the stud threads 
aren't the same, but there's no really danger of cross-threading. As 
soon as the stud seats, stop, back off, and the nut comes off. You 
won't find this tip in any book, because it's bad practice, and there's 
a slim chance that the nut might lock in. (That didn't happen once in 
sixteen studs.) Anyway, it works.
