Subject: RE: [T2] have to double pump my clutch

I'm having the same problam right now, but it seems to come and go. My van 
is an 82, aircooled, and it is a hydro clutch system. The slave cyl is on 
the drivers side, visible through the rear wheel well. I noticed that mine 
had quite a bit of play in it when it was being engaged and disengaged. The 
whole unit was moving up and down about a quarter inch (maybe less, I tend 
to exagerate sometimes...:) ) and it looked like the problem was in the 
bracket that holds it on. I couldn't find any loose bolts or broken bits, 
but it was dark and wet. I'm planning on having a closer look when the 
ground dries off in the next few days (I hope it does) so until then, let 
the double pumping commence!
