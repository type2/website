.... This
&gt; model camper has the stove, sink (with external pump), refridgerator (does
&gt; anyone know if this refridge is propane fueled -  how I may find out?)....

If it is indeed a westy, the fridge runs off 12V battery.  Mine was wired to
an Aux battery when I bought the bus but it can also run off city power if
you switch the Batt/city power switch.  I own a 77 mostly original Westy and
I can only assume that mine is set up like yours.
