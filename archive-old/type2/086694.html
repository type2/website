Subject: Re: [T2] Aftermarket Tents

&gt;&gt;I see all this stuff on side mounted tents, and I keep thinking.........
&gt;&gt;Once the tent is set up, you are stuck to it.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;A separate tent allows you to stash your stuff in a bit more security
than
&gt;&gt;just setting things outside on the picnic table, and you can drive away
and
&gt;&gt;return later

We purchased a Komet side tent from Steve at Eurocampers last spring and it
is AWESOME, the best $300 we ever spent.

We have 2 kids and when we travel the camper is full to the brim. When we
stop the first thing I do is set up the tent, which takes me about 15-20
minutes with my 2 year old son &quot;helping&quot;. All the poles are springloaded
and lock together and the only a second person is handy is pulling the tent
over the frame, but I've done that myself too. Then we unload the bus into
the tent. Plenty of room for 2 car seats, plastic tubs of gear, cooler,
table and chairs, etc.

Most of the time we camp we don't leave the site but we camped for a week
with my parents and drove away twice. It is tricky getting repositioned,
but the tent has a boot that gives you about 6 inches of leeway or so. The
tent zips up completely when not attached. My parents have a 22' Toyota
based Winnebago which is real nice but when we were camping with them we
ate dinner every night in our tent because there was so much more room then
their Winnebago.

I just ordered a 45 liter bottom mount water tank from Steve so I can pull
the water tank out of the cabinet and get more storage space and water
capacity. I'm moving my propane tank to the driver side (like the Vanagon)
and this tank will mount on the passenger side. I already have an RV style
water pump that can &quot;pull&quot; the water up from the tank, so the only tricky
thing will be the filler. When I get it installed I will take some
pictures.
