Subject: Re: [T2] RE: Brake Booster Removal


Not sure about rotor spec. I have had to file the edges of brake pads to
get them to slide and once had to sand down the pad a tiny bit to get it to
not bind, but that was with new rotors and calipers. I think the pad size
is probably generic and is mass produced to fit a number of different
vehicles. Quality control on $10.00 (my cost anyway) brake pads is not
likely to be that great. Just a thought...

Guys,

Sorry I didn't cover it from the beginning.
Now that I have your attention, I asked the question last
Friday afternoon after I had it off...

Not one person replied...what do you think you guys were
doing....taking friday afternoon off????&lt;grin&gt;


*Yes*, I have replaced everything(almost).  New cylinders in the rear, new
hoses all around, *new* german calipers, new master cylinder, new shoes,
pads and backing plates..  I pulled the booster off to clean it
and paint it and found the brake fluid in it.  The old mc was *not* wet
inside so I have no idea how the fluid got there(132k original miles).

Cleaned the fill tank and the little &quot;resevoir&quot; on top of the mc as well.

I am ready to bleed the system this afternoon when I get home.

Can someone verify for me that the Bently is correct on minimum
rotor thickness on the front of a 78.  When I pulled my rotors and checked
them, they were both .440.  Damn, book says minimum is .452....so I
ordered some new ones.

Put everything back together so i could bleed them this evening and
the new calipers/pads are  very close/lightly rubbing on the old rotors.
If new rotors are about .512? then I'm not sure I can get them in!  New
caliper cylinders are definitely not extended at all.

Cheers ,dave

&gt; &gt; Mine had brake fluid in it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Maybe 1/4 cup.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Rinsed it twice with a bottle of alcohol each
&gt; &gt; time.  Shook it out let it dry over night...hope it works fine&lt;grin&gt;.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If it worked with the brake fluid in it, I suspect it would work just
fine
&gt; &gt; without it also.
