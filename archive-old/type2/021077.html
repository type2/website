&gt; Any bug engine with a doghouse set-up will give you all the parts you need
&gt; EXCEPT the front upper tin. That piece is 71 bus ONLY. Make sure you also
&gt; get the L bracket that mounts on the oil cooler. Nick-named the 'hoover
&gt; bit'.

Karl, list:
Also necessary on some early single relief engines are the stepped seals. I'm
looking for a set of these right now to put a doghouse cooler and alternator on
a 67 1500 engine. The seals I need are part number 111-117-151b (need 2 per
engine) or kit number 111-198-029.
Anyone listening have these?
Thanks,
