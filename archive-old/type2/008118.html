Truck parts places are good for this kind of stuff.

Be sure that the hose that the FLAPS sells you is made to work with
fuel.  I've had them try to sell me radiator hose saying &quot;it's the
same stuff&quot; but, trust me, it's not!  Fuel hose should say what it is
right on the hose.

The elbow is a great idea.  You can either have a muffler shop make
the correct bend, or you can cut a wedge out of a length of tubing and
weld/braze up your own elbow.
