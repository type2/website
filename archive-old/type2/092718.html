Subject: Re: [T2] Splitting cases; WHY didn't someone mention this??? :-(

Why not hang the engine from each cylinder at a time and tap the piston 
with a wooden block and hammer forcing the piston to come out?

You have to catch the engine with some cardboard and old rags or carpet and 
a sheet of plywood of course. I wouldn't let it drop more than an inch or 
so. Repeat for each cylinder. Use the engine's weight to your advantage.

Maybe heat the cylinders with a propane torch.. An oxy/acteylene torch 
would work but you'd have to be careful not to melt anything.

Suspend the engine using vise grips hanging from wire loops on a cross bar 
of steel or wood beneath a step ladder (or something similar).

Not very scientific...

&gt; &gt; Pull the piston circlips and tap the wrist pins out.
&gt;
&gt;Chris, Thanks for the reply.
&gt;
&gt;*That* is the problem; if only I could pull the circlips and pins. As I wrote
&gt;in my initial post, the cases are split and separated by nearly 3&quot;. This
&gt;means that the pins are down inside the bore where they are inaccessible.
&gt;And, the cases won't rejoin, so I just can't get to the clips and pins.
&gt;
&gt;If i can't get the case halves to rotate back into alignment, I'm going to
&gt;have to hacksaw the rods... all of them, to get the cases apart.
&gt;
&gt;I've taken a break from the job and will wait until I have help tomorrow. I
&gt;think if someone else holds the cases up on end (one set of pistons down)
&gt;maybe I can find what is causing them to lock out of alignment. Then, if i
&gt;can get the cases to rejoin, I can get to the pins.
&gt;
&gt;Cheers/Don
