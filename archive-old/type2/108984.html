Subject: RE: [T2] growling while driving over 35mph

Could be lot's of things...wheel bearings &amp; tranny's come to mind. Does it
occur in more than one gear? If you shift to neutral at highway speed does
it stay or go away? Does the tone change with vehicle speed or engine speed?
You can usually narrow the source down by considering what parts are moving
at what speeds under what conditions. Also, crawl under the bus and look at
and wiggle all the drive line and suspension related parts.

Have you hit any bumps lately? A seriously misaligned tire might make funny
noises. Tires inflated correctly?

I've found the Muir book to be very helpful diagnosing funny noises.

I have a question: When driving over thirty five miles
per hour, I get this kind of continuous growling/low
rumbling noise. It is the same kind of noise one might
get if the steel belts on a tire were exposed (if you
can imagine that). This goes away under 35mph, and
therefore cannot tell if it is doing it going around
corners (would be an indication if it were front
bearings). My question is, has anyone else had this
happen to them? Where to start troubleshooting?
