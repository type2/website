Subject: Re: [T2] My Top Ten Things I hate about Owning a Bus.

Youve got to add odd smells in with the odd noises thing.


&gt; 10. There are only 3 days each year when I am not either hot or cold.
&gt; 9.  New Noises.
&gt; 8.  Hearing tire dealers say, &quot;they don't make tires for that any more&quot;
&gt; 7.  Hearing tire dealers say, &quot;passenger tires are fine on that&quot;
&gt; 6.  Jerks who break off my antenna and scratch &quot;f*&amp;% you&quot; on my door.
&gt; 5.  Jerks who break in and steal my tools.
&gt; 4.  Annual safety inspections.
&gt; 3.  Rust.
&gt; 2.  electrical component decay.
&gt; 1.  Waiting on parts.
