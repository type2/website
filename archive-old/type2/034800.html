Subject: Re: shift knob extensions?

&gt; I want to put the VDO 3 guage under dash console in.  My shift knob will
hit
&gt; it in first.

If you haven't already, you could put a quick shift kit on it which shortens
the throw of the shift stick about 40%. It took me less than ten minutes to
install and cost a whole $2 from jc whitney (i have seen them everywhere
though). It works great. This might be enough to prevent the stick from
hitting the gauge...
