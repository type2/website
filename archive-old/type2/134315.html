Subject: Re: [T2] Bay clocks

George asked:

 Is it possible that the early clocks were electric with mechanical
 movements and the late clocks were electronic?  That would explain the
 difference in motion.

No, the 75 grey faced clock and the later black ones are 100% quartz.

The earlier one with the silver center are mechanical with an electric winder.
These clocks do not have a 2nd hand.
