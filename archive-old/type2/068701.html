Subject: '70 Heater Cable bellows booties available anywhere?

        Volks,
        Title says it- for our single cab. Existing booties are all 
cracked and fallen to ruin. Anyone know of a replacement or cross-out 
from another model or brand? 

        Years ago, Automobile Atlanta sold little rubber bits for
914s that sealed their heater control wires, which were solid wire
with a plastic coating. No bellows, and the plastic coated wire
slipped easily through the rubber part. It fit about an 8mm
cable tube. I may try those if I can't find replacements
for what it should be.

        Bill
