Subject: airflow sensor on a 77 Westy

Recently I checked the flow sensor on my 77 Westy, and the resistance 
values came up a little higher then the range of specs in the Bently 
Manual.  Is this OK or is the sensor bad.  Also the flow sensor is a 
rebuild (originally a Bosh) and the part number doesn't match what the 
Bently manual has.  Is this possibly a problem?

thanks 

Andy
