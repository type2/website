Subject: Re: [T2] FI Fuel pump runs. And runs, and runs.

&gt; I think I have a fried double relay.  The fuel pump was running on this
&gt; morning and the bus started right up.  I installed the Pertronix set,
&gt; adjusted the timing, and it idled and revved good.  I went inside to get my
&gt; wallet, and then the bus either wouldn't start and/or wouldn't idle.  Later
&gt; in the day I ran Mike's suggested tests on the double relay and everything
&gt; looked ok, except the fuel pump wasn't getting any power at that point.  I
&gt; plugged the double relay back in, and it clicked, but I got no fuel
&gt; pressure.

hmmm, wonder if you have a bad wire running from relay to fuel pump.  does
the fuel pump run when you push the AFM air flap??

&gt; At this point it looks like my double relay is fried - it keeps the pump
&gt; running on sometimes, and at other times it won't make the pump run at all.
&gt; Could there be other culprits?

I would still suspect a bad connection...somewhere.

&gt; I'm hoping that replacing the double relay will get me back on the road.  I
&gt; tried to buy one locally but couldn't locate one at the local dealer or Peak
&gt; Performance (closest VW shop).

boy if Peek doesn't have it I can't think of anyplace local that might.
