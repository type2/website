Subject: [T2] Free stuff in MD - needs to picked up TODAY
Content-Disposition: inline

Listers,

I moved out of my house but could not take all my bus parts. A cleaning crew is coming tomorrow morning - everything that is there at that point will be junked :(

I have: 1 rust free and dent free 79 nose (cut through floor and roof)
Steve, do you want to get it for Niki?

misc engine parts, including fan housing, alternator, sheet metal

These parts can be picked up at 604 Elm Ave, Takoma Park, MD 20912 (just north of DC)

Call me at 01149 - 179 387 5 387 or Gil at (301) 332 7467 to arrange a pick up time TODAY.

Do not reply by email - I won't check my mail again until it is too late.

Marcus

back in Germany, just fired up my 74 Westfalia Offenbach again
