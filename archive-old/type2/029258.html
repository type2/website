to chime in a bit:

In order to keep water mud and much from entering through the breather in my
steering box (land Cruiser), I loaded it with grease.

It's an old trick that also happens to retard leakage.

Actually, bus boys and wolfgang both recommend a thicker lube for
steering boxes, not to alleviate play, but to retard leakage.

Not much play can be adjusted out of the boxes.  If it's really
that bad, then buck up and have it rebuilt, or find a good used one.
