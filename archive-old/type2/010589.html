Subject: Ever a bad idea  to rebuild?
Message-ID: &lt;19991111175519.41589.qmail_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt;

I have a '74 Transporter with 145K original miles on the engine.  I've 
practically replaced everything on the engine (carb, fuel pump, etc. etc.), 
and I'm thinking of having the engine rebuilt.  Is this ever a bad idea?  
Will the engine ever be as good as its early years?  Is $900 a decent price 
to rebuild, including new pistons, rings, cylinders, etc.?  Any suggestions?

Thanks,
Dustin
