I didn't want to bring this up until Friday, but it has relavence to the =
fire thread.  While watching USA's Cannonball run, the race was delayed =
due to a fire on the highway.  Joking to my wife, I said it was probably =
a bus.  Sure enough, when the cannonball car with the camera crew rolled =
past, there was a late model bay on the side of the road...  All that =
was left was a shell.  Glass, tires, paint, interior, lenses, everything =
appeared to be destroyed.  Was this a case of &quot;VW Fuel Line Syndrome =
(VWFLS) or a careless cigarette?  We may never know, unless the owner of =
said bus is on this list.  Vehicle fires are very scary things.  I have =
seen 2 up close and personal.  One was my friends loaf, the other was =
some older lady's N*va, (funny story, she pulled into the gas station i =
was at and parked next to the pump).  The bus lived on with some major =
rewiring work.  The nova looked like instant scrap metal after 20 =
minutes... Earlier this year there was a thread on installing some sort =
of automatic extinguisher system in the engine bay of a bus.  A good =
idea?  Yes.  Expensive?  Quite possibly.  A family's lives saved from =
incineration?  Priceless.  Are Vw's more prone to fire?  I think that =
answer lies in the owner not the engineering.  Any negligent owner could =
have a 30 year old burning heap of ford as easily as a VW.  Saftey =
should come before cosmetics, and that includes doing the most basic =
maintenence routines to your vehicle.  I replace my fuel ring with =
mercedes benz high pressure fuel lines every 3 years. (I've had this bus =
for 6)   I routinely look at my wiring in the engine compartment when i =
adjust timing/change points/spark plugs/fidle with idle adjustments.  =
When an oil leak sprouts, track down the culprit and fix it properly.  A =
fire can not exist without fuel.  Sure the magnesiam cases of the Type 1 =
motor will burn very hot, but they will not reach high enough =
temperature to spontaneously combust!  You will melt your valves/seize =
bearings/whatever before that ever happens and that is not even a =
concern with the type IV case.  Bottom line folks:  don't let gasoline =
leaks go unattended.  Better yet don't let your vehicle go unattended.

Sorry about the length of this post, but some topics get me fired up!!!  =
 ;-)
