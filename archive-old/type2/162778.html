  Question

Jon,

I have had to do this on an engine I built many years ago.

I made a template from a block of aluminum and very carefully adjusted
the drill stop so this I didn't drill too deep.

It has worked well for years.  The main concern is drilling and taping 
&quot;straight&quot;  so that you don't get into the oil chamber.


Cheers, dave

&gt;
&gt; My brand-spanking-new 1600 DP doesn't have the stud for mounting the
&gt; thermostat so I had to omit it. My previous stock motor had the thermostat
&gt; and it ran like a champ.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Does anyone know if I can or should drill and tap a AS41 case for the
&gt; thermostat mount?
