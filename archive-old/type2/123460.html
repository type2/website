Thanks Bob but I bought this engine with the Bus and it was a trade for a 
'72 Super Beetle to boot. I don't believe that I have the Small Warranty 
card. Plus I don't feel like I would have them replace/repair anything that 
I want to use in any vehicle I own. If it is worth doing it is worth doing 
right. Thanks for the imput.
