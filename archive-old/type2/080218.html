Subject: Re: [T2] black crud coming off my 1970's steering wheel

ashes to ashes dust to dust so too goes my bus.  Paint fades steel rusts
entropy strikes again.  Its jut the natural breakdownof the rubber used to
make the wheel, most rubber revitalizers that i have tried seem to make
the problem worse though i think its not true rubber but a vinyl foam.  A
good question though is does this happen in drier climates as well? Is
moisture catalyzing the acceleration of the materials decay?  If so then
we have a chance of putting up a good fight otherwise encapsulation may be
the only answer, every old car that i have driven with a wheel of a
similar material has done this  including my old toyota and friends fox.
i have a theory though that it may be the result of driving with greasy or
oily hands and the oil irepairably damages the foam, it makes sense, i
know i have driven after making roadside reapirs with filthy hands.
anyone have any support for that idea?
