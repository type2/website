&gt; The best defense is keep an eye in your rear view mirror when

&gt; and you hear locked up rubber sliding on the pavement.

   I was stopped at a red light in my Bugeye when a Ford wagon rear-ended
me...The guy claimed he didn't see me... 
   I suppose if I was really alert I could have avoided him by running out 
into
the crossing traffic... ;-(
