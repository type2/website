Subject: Re: [T2] 6K for a 1970 hardtop Westie? How to buy a bus.

[...]

Too much unless you planned to buy a bus an completely repaint it as this one was done.  If you keep this bus for a couple of years then try to sell it, you'll have a tough time getting $3000.

&gt;I've found a bus that is really nice, but I think they might be asking too
&gt;much, so I wanted to get your opinion on the bus.   It's a 1970 westy
&gt;hardtop (supposedly).   The price they're asking is $6000.   Its been
&gt;completely stripped and all rust removed then repainted to white.   The
&gt;interior is completely redone to (supposedly) original condition.   The
&gt;motor and gearbox have been rebuilt approx. 10k  miles ago to original
&gt;specs.  It has a new braking system including master cylinder and all drums
&gt;and shoes.    The seller showed me receipts that totalled to about 10k.   3k
&gt;alone for the body and paint.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;	Mike, 
&gt;	Buy the most bus you can get- usually this is the nicest bus
&gt;and the most expensive. The newer you are to this, the more
&gt;important it is to start with a good vehicle. My first bus
&gt;was a '69 I paid $1200 for. It grenaded its engine after 2500
&gt;miles. I'd barely learned to do valves and oil changes, and I
&gt;couldn't come up with money and time to rebuild the engine :
&gt;
&gt;	THERE IS NO PERFECT BUS. BE PREPARED TO WALK AWAY FROM ANY BUS
&gt;YOU ARE OFFERED. ANOTHER WILL COME ALONG. REALLY.
&gt;
&gt;	$3K for body and paint is about right for  a good quality job if 
&gt;the shop is good, but it wouldn't pay for completely stipped to bare metal, 
&gt;windows removed, interior removed. Did the owner do the prep-work?
&gt;But $3K might pay for a nice paint job. Personally, since I'm in 
&gt;California, I'm not a fan of removing the factory paint. The respray 
&gt;primer and paint may be good, but the factory stuff, if undamaged, is 
&gt;better than anything a body shop can put on for $3K. Stripped to bare
&gt;metal and painted with Imron? Sure, better than factory, but not
&gt;for $3K. 
&gt;
&gt;	We paid $1200 for our 70 single-cab, as a glider, no engine, and getting
&gt;it to move under its own power with a new motor, new CVs, master cylinder,
&gt;new tranny seals, welded up battery tray, new battery, odds and ends,
&gt;brought the grand total to $4400. 5 years ago. In that light, $6K for
&gt;a hardtop Westie that's done right is a reasonable price. 
&gt;
&gt;	Buy the Muir book, read the chapter about buying a VW, do the
&gt;several-hour inspection yourself or do what you can and hire a local
&gt;shop to do the compression, and so forth. DO look for rust under the
&gt;mats, around the front windshield seal down by the wipers, under the
&gt;battery, under the carpets. DO look at the color of the brake fluid
&gt;in the resevior, (clear-to faintly yellow? Or filthy black?)
&gt;oil on the dip-stick (Honey color? filthy black?), underside of engine 
&gt;and tranny. 
&gt;
&gt;	At 10K miles, engine and tranny should be clean, dry, neat.
&gt;CVs, ball joints in front suspension, brake master and slave cylinders
&gt;are all wear items to check- no leaks anywhere, right? There's a
&gt;seal around the shifter at the nose of the tranny- check there. For
&gt;$6K, it should still have the snow-saucer sized cover that goes under
&gt;the pedals and keeps dirt and water out of them and daylight from showing
&gt;around the pedal shafts where they come through the floor. Of course
&gt;the sliding door should operate smoothly opening and shutting.
&gt;
&gt;	ALL the locks, all the electrical bits, all the windows should work
&gt;for $6K. Bumpers should be firmly attached, head liner clean, seats
&gt;comfortable, seatbelts present and working well. This is 'high market'
&gt;and lack of original paint means its NOT a low-wear creampuff.
&gt;
&gt;	Your milage may vary, and its your money. Something WILL go wrong
&gt;after you buy it, expect the unexpected, be prepared to spend $500
&gt;in the first 6 months and be happy if you don't.
&gt;
&gt;	Happy motoring!
&gt;	Bill
