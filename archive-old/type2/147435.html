Subject: Re: [VB] DIY Westy Plaid!

Mike, listees,
I have no ambition of wearing a Westy Plaid kilt or having as much as a 
Westy Plaid silk snot rag. I was amazed that one could use the 
internet(s) to recreate a Westy plaid to use as a wallpaper or a web 
page background or a skin for the app of the moment on their PC or cell 
phone. There are other tools available, search on &quot;tartan design&quot; for a 
bunch of 'em.  If they're limited in the color range, pull out a 
graphics editing tool and substitute their bland yellow with a real 
chrome yellow. You never know, somebody at this moment might be feeding 
walmart pillow cases into their HP inkjet printers to sell on Ebay 
tomorrow.

If you need real, authentic, ancient Westy polyester plaid look up my 
buddy Karl here in Fresno. 

  -Harry

p.s. If you look into tartan sites you'll find one designed for the 
&quot;Craik of Assington&quot;, no lie.
