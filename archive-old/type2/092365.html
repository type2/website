Subject: WTB: CA 81-83 air cooled Fuel Injection &amp; Ignition System

Hi All:

I am looking to buy a complete (or as much as possible) CA fuel
injection and ignition system for my 82 Vanagon. I am converting mine
from federal to CA so that I can have the O2 sensor (better fuel
mileage, emissions, longer life on the catalytic converter) and the
electronic ignition. I have put together a list of the parts I believe I
need. Please feel free to add any that I have missed. The parts list is
derived from ETKA and Bentleys.

Yes I know that it would be cheaper to either use Megasquirt or
something like Pertronix to achieve this goal, but for now I want to try
getting the stock system first. Pmail me if you have any parts
available.

Regards,
