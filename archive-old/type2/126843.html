&gt; Let's put the creativity I know you all have to work!  I look forward to

Hmmm, what kind of wheelchair do you use?  Entry to the bus is not hard,
what with the big sliding door, but getting into the driver's seat will be
a challenge.  You can't cut down the pedestal, as it is also the front
wheel well.  You'd have to devise a way to transfer to the driver's seat
from the rear.  This may or may not be a challenge depending upon your
ability to transfer back and forth.

I don't mean to discourage you.  Any and all problems can be overcome with
application of money and creativity.
