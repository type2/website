Yup,

I do this job on stands with the wheels removed for easy access.  I also find it
easier to rotate the half shafts to position the bolts for torqueing. Maybe this
way is just easier for me because I am left-handed.  I always had a difficult
time with the wheels on the ground.  Do what works for you.
