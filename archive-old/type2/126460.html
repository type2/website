Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Swap Info?

I don't think that you're the only one who prefers stock transporters
on this list. I think that most people are just understanding the
benefits.

If the 1000-ish people on the list preferred a swap, KEP would be
overloaded with orders. ;-)

I personally prefer a perfect stock engine to the Toyota, but there's
more to the equation for me than just a vague preference. I think most
of the list would agree that VW did a kick-butt job in designing the
air cooled engine in general and the Type 4 engine in particular.

&gt; I am really astounded that in this community of interest, which
&gt; includes over 1000 subscribers, I seem to be the only person that
&gt; actually likes and prefers transporters pretty-much-as-designed. Or who
&gt; thinks that one of the things that is most attractive about baywindow
&gt; buses is that they are slow and underpowered, requiring us (as drivers)
&gt; to think and drive differently from every other driver on the road.
&lt;/snip&gt;


30 years ago I'd say we need to go smoke the peace pipe. ;-) But now,
I'll just have a beer  and respect your opinions.
