&gt; hi all, i am taking a trip next week in my westy and wonder about one of my
&gt; tires that has a plug in it.  what's the deal with plugged tires? can they
&gt; be used hard, what kind of life expectancy does a tire have with a plug?  -

In the old days, plugs were temporary fixes only.  These days, some claim
that they are as sound as the original tire rubber.

However, if it's _my_ bus on the line, I insist that the tire be removed
from the rim and a patch applied to the inside of the tire.  The added
expense to do it right is worth not having a problem down the road as the
tire wears.
