&gt; &gt;I just filled out the survey, for my '67 &quot;vanagon&quot;. They didn't even have a

&gt; What did you all put for the 'extra credit essay' at the end, entitled
&gt; 'how do you like your car?' ?
&gt;
&gt; Here's mine --
&gt; &quot;My bus is like my best friend.
&gt; You could not name a single car in the world that I would swap it for,
&gt; other than to sell that car in order to buy back my bus plus a hundred
&gt; other buses (and maybe a couple Porsche 356's if I had some money
&gt; left over :-)&quot;
&gt;
That sounds a lot like what I wrote.
I thought it was pretty funny, in the sections where they ask what work you
have done/ had done to the vehicle, and I checked that I had rebuilt the
engine, and the entire brake system, as well as some wiring. I then, quite
honestly, checked that I was very satisfied with the conditions and performance
of those systems. Boy, I bet they'll wonder what kind of fruitcake enjoys that
sort of thing. I tried to explain in my essay that it was a restoration, but it
still seemed vastly different from the norm.
