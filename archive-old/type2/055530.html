Subject: MORE owners manuals

I've spent the last three days sorting VW literature of all kinds.  Of
course I found tons more than I ever thought I had.  I have every year
Owners Manual form 1968-1982 Type 2.   Maybe I can help lots of you;  All
buses had the same O.M. regarless of the model.  Sometimes the car came
with a special supplement, but the books were the same.  Only 1 exception,
you can guess what it was, or yell it at me if you know.

I do have several camper BROCHURES 68-71ish, multiple page color
propaganda.

Some service coupons

Tons of original LIFE magazine ads  and other magazines 59-late 70s

some BLUE POUCHES

Color wiring diagrams,LAMINATED

Anyway, I'm headed to the LA VW pa- pa- pa- pa- Porsche  Toy and LITERATURE
show this evening, Sat show.

If you are going, come by and say &quot;HI&quot; I', the one with the MASSIVE amounts
of VW literature and the BIG SMILE, I am the perfectly happy man you
know-100%

see you there I hope
