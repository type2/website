I say well done to the Admin! Keep the subject VW (Having said that in a
couple of months when our baby's born, your gonna hear about it whether it's
Friday or not!)

Well, Andrew, at least mention something about how you are planning to
retrofit or baby proof your hi-top for the new passenger!

Actually, I will soon be a proud, but waaay too young, &lt;shudder&gt; grandfather
and I would like to obtain the front baby hammock that installs over the
front seats of my 71 Westy.  I figure I can easily make the canvas part, but
I need the two poles.  (I already have the clips.)  If anyone has a pair
they want to sell or any leads on where I could obtain them I would be most
grateful.

Thanks,

Alan
