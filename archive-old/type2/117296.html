&gt; Anyone ever pushed this limit and lived to tell?&lt;grin&gt;

with my old 1960 23window I towed some 33ft long lengths of railroad rail,
1,400 lbs, fortunately I only hauled them about a mile at VERY slow speed
but hauled about 20 of em one at a time......woould NEVER be so cruel to
my bus again.  Never got out of first gear....and didn't bother putting
them on a trailer, just hauled em dragging along behind the van....
