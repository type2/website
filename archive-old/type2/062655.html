Subject: TRANS SWAP-THE SAGA

OK- we now know that a '75 tranny will fit in a '72 with a bellhousing swap. Now, will that '75 trans go into my '69?  I know it's a longshot, but I'm exploring all of my options here.  This jumping out of second gear is becoming a nuisance while trying to climb hills.

Any comments will be appreciated.
