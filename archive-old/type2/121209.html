Subject: Re: [T2] Experience with aircooled_dot_net Oil Pressure Relief 
  Valve Resurfacing Tool

Hi Scott:

How much did your idle pressure improve (i.e. what was it before/after 
and at what engine temperature)? Did you use the tool with the engine 
assembled? Did it leave any shavings that were hard to clean out before 
reassembly?

Thanks for the information.

Regards,

&gt;yes to all. it worked for me. i wish we had them to rent/sell also, but i'd
&gt;feel bad about stealing the idea :-)
