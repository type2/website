Guys:

As a retired LTC, Armor, I know that the military has been using Halon
extinguishers for at least 40 years in the automatic fire retardant
systems in their tanks.  A tank has four crewmembers.  It costs a lot of
time and money to train new tankers.  Therefore, I suspect that so long
as you are not breathing Halon directly from the bottle under pressure,
it should be safe to hose down the engine compartment of your busses
with the stuff!

Regards,

Don Kaag
