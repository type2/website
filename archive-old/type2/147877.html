&gt;I haven't made it to fusion yet, but I do *burn* the stuff.  There's really
&gt;plenty of room to store hydrogen in a Bus if you're creative!

I like to replace the seats with air mattresses and store my hydrogen in 
them, then, when my butt hits the deck I know it's time to refill the &quot;tanks&quot;

&gt;My primary hydrogen storage is in two long cylinders that I've mounted in
&gt;place of the old front and rear bumpers.  I also keep a reserve supply in all
&gt;four of my tires, though I haven't figured out how to connect them to the fuel
&gt;system yet.  Or how to solve the issue of the tires going flat when I access
&gt;their contents.

Ahh.. been there tried that..  The tires also can't seem to keep the temps 
under control.  However, for access to the spare supply, the inflation 
system off a Hummer works great, just run it in reverse to get the fuel out.

&gt;Since there are times I need extra power, I keep a premixed supply of hydrogen
&gt;and pure oxygen in a third tank that I've custom-mounted in the unused space
&gt;in the engine compartment -- you know, directly above the engine.  This &quot;turbo
&gt;boost tank&quot; is ported directly to the intake manifold, so when I need to pass
&gt;a Ferrari or whatever, I can just pull a knob on the console to open the
&gt;valve, and then hold on tight.  At least that's the theory!  I'll be testing
&gt;it out tonight.

The other cool trick is to use rubber cement and Hydrogen Peroxide.  This 
is what powered the first private space vehicle designed by the legendary 
Burt Rutan.  Just be sure to coat the intake manifolds with plenty of bear 
grease so that the rubber cement doesn't stick.  I would recommend WD-40, 
but for some reason my manifold keeps exploding whenever I open up the 
oxygen valve.. I'll have to work on a different WD-40 injector system it seems.
