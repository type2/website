Subject: Re: [T2] [Friday] Make your own bus!

&gt; &gt; I'm gonna print it black and white so it's not that awful snot green color.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Hahahaha, here come the flames from all the owners of green buses.
&gt;
&gt;you mean the baby shit green????  first thing I did with my green bus, was
&gt;PAINT it blue.......Bob

And then there were the Cow Poop Edition busses in the late 70's. We 
thought that a Champagne Edition bus would be a Champagne color like two of 
our Hondas. Doesn't matter - it's VW Tornado red now. When Cow Poop 
Editions are valuable based on their colors, we'll paint it again.

Ah the colorful 70's. I'm not responsible - - I was too young...
