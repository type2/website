Subject: Re: [T2] turning brakes/my bus baffles me...

I had a similar problem on my Beetle.  Turned out that one piston in 
one front wheel cylinder was frozen (corroded) in place.  You might 
want to take off the your left front drum, and then have a helper 
SLOWLY depress the brake pedal.  See if both wheel cylinders are active.

&gt; For those that haven't been paying attention to my problems, my brakes 
&gt; used to make my bus turn to the left, pretty hard. So tonight I 
&gt; replaced both front brake hoses, bleed the brakes and took a test 
&gt; drive.
&gt;
&gt; Now it still turns to the right, but not nearly as drastically. 
&gt; Improvement for sure but not perfect.
&gt;
&gt; Any explanations out there? Are the pads worn unevenly? Could a rear 
&gt; brake be causing this? Am I simply asking too much out of my bus to 
&gt; want to brake in a straight line??
