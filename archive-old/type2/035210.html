&gt;Dave's suggestions are quite good.  The only thing I would add, related to
&gt;the preheat, is the fact that you might be experiencing some carb icing.
&gt;Next time it's cold and you start your bus, check out the intake manifold
&gt;(the steel piping that the carb is mounted on that runs to the block) and
&gt;see if you're developing a frost right underneath your carb(s?).

I'll bet this is in the archives somewhere.

Know all ye Type I motor heads that most have been assembled improperly.
The carb pre-heat tube that runs from no.4 exhaust pipe to under the carb
and across to the no. 2 exhaust pipe will not flow warm exhaust gases with
the same gaskets at the pipe flanges. One of the gaskets must have but a
5mm or so hole only, so a differntial in pressure will create a cross flow.
If your not set up this way, you are throwing away 5% or more in gas milage
and will not get the immediate benefit of fast warmup from cold start.
