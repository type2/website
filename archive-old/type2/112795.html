Subject: Re: [T2] very good horn question

the 12 volts doesn't go to the column.  It goes to the horn directly. 
the column only grounds it and makes the horn blow.  Pull the wires from
the horn (have to turn ignition on) and check which one is hot. (then
turn ignition off)  The other wire will go from the other connector on
the horn to the base of the steering column outer tube and hook to the
bottom of it just above the steering box.  The wire that goes from the
horn button goes down the middle of the shaft (not the column outer
tube) and hooks to the steering coupler.  In essence, when you mash the
horn button, it grounds the shaft to the column thereby grounding the
horn, making it blow.  I hope this makes sense.  Greg
