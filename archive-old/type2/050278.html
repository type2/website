Subject: [T2] Loud clunking noise

    Can anyone suggest what the cause might be of a loud clunking noise
coming from I think the rear undercarriage of my 79 bus?  My mechanic  just
replaced the rubber engine mounts and that did not solve the problem.
Exhaust system is tight, shocks appear to be OK.  I live on a gravel road
any bump makes the car sound like it's drumming, very loud, like metal
hitting metal.  It's not noisy on a very smooth road.  Nothing is obviously
loose.  Any ideas on how to diagnose the problem?   thanks,  Mimi Cantwell
