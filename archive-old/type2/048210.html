&gt; Hey All --
&gt; bus.  Great fun, but we had our share of anomalies -- and there is one I
&gt; want to ask about.  Cruising SW through the incredible Monument Valley (UT)
&gt; at 60-65 MPH, we noticed some irritating scratchy sounds coming from our
&gt; door-mounted speakers, nearly drowning out my Neil Young tape.  Immediately
&gt; after, I felt the engine miss significantly.  I turned the cassette player
...
&gt; miles as the missing would apparently subside and we would became tired of
&gt; the silence, we would try the cassette player/radio again and after awhile
&gt; it would again emit scratchy noises and then the engine would very
&gt; noticeably miss soon after (and continue to do so at intermittent
&gt; intervals).

Sounds like a milder (and more frustrating) version of the problem with my
wife's bug.  Electrical short causes sparks which interfere with the radio
and then cause the engine to cut out.  You might want to examine the wires
and harnesses near the engine where things vibrate.  It could also be an
intermittant
open.  If you can get it to happen at predictable times, you can hot wire
the distributor with a jumper from the battery and see if the problem
disappears.
