Subject: Re: [T2] So a fellow paints his bus

I received a rediculous quote on the weekend to paint my bus.  It was $5,000, not including any parts.  1 week to prep, 1 week to paint, 1/2 week to put back together.  The cost of the paint alone was $1000.  Obviously, this vw shop didn't need the business.

Some kind of interim paintwork done by me is starting to sound like a better idea all the time.
