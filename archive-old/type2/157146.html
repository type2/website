Subject: Re: VWoA still being VWoA

Unfortunately, not only is the &quot;VW&quot; logo trademarked,
but so is the likeness of their automobiles, and the
use of the term &quot;beetle&quot; or &quot;bug&quot; and a bunch of other
stuff, when used in relation to automobiles. 

Most companies would just stop at the name. But, VW,
knowing that they have created icons with the bug and
bus, decided to go a step further and go for the whole
&quot;likeness&quot; thing. 

And although cafepress may be considered &quot;public
domain&quot;, VW will not think the same way about their
trademarks, which are not public domain. 

Unless you draw something that looks nothing like a
bus (you might call it, a &quot;plane&quot;) they will nail you.
Even if it's your &quot;artistic rendition&quot;. 

It's lunacy, and it's been covered here before. Feel
free to paruse the archives for stories of people who
have gotten nailed for painting mugs with peoples own
vans on them, or making jewlery with VW symbols on the
beads. 

This is why even if VW did make a new &quot;bus&quot; it would
never have the 'heart' of the old one.

&quot;Hi Don,
It would appear to me that they would not be able to
enforce a cease 
and
desist order on an artist's rendition with no logos on
it. I think you 
would
have a good case.  

I must say that I am no lawer, but I did stay at a
Holiday Inn last 
night.
