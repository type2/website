Subject: RE: [T2] Westfalia concept car

I am not sure about the normal clearance, but if you watch the video on the
site, the bus lowers itself when you stop to camp. I just barely noticed it in
the video, but the first thing it does when it stops is lower down. I am sure
the clearance does not compare to our busses, but not everyone needs that much
clearance. I have never been &quot;off road&quot; with mine and never plan to. So it is
not an issue for me. Of course I like a lowered bus anyway :)

I have to wonder whether one of the reasons for the favorable responses
to this design is the ground clearance. The concept is based on a
lowered bus. That's one thing that I really don't like about it. It'll
be pretty near useless for real camping.
