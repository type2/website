Subject: Re: [T2] replacing the master cylinder

&lt;&lt; I have to replace the master cylinder.  It seems to me that someone
mentioned that I should soak the new one in brake fluid before putting it
on.  Is that right?


Tim &gt;&gt;

Not soak, but &quot;pre-bleed&quot;...If you can, put it into a machinist's vise and
fill the reservoir on top and using short sections of brake line (some
MC's come with plastic plugs and lines to facilitate this...) pump the
brake fluid thru' itself to remove as much air from the MC as possible
before installing it...Saves a lot of pumping after installation pushng
those air bubbles thru' the lines to the bleed screws at the wheel
cylinders...I try and save the plastic plugs that come with MC's and
calipers to hold the fluid in the MC while it's being installed...Never 
been completely successful the position of the MC under the Bus and
you under the MC means some (OK, lots) of brake fluid on your hands...
