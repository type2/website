Subject: thanks and a quick electrical question

thanks to the list and the archive I discovered that my starting problem on 
my 71 westy was the ignition wire assembly...who'da thought?
quick question...my high beams are stuck in one position...the wire had come 
off of the top of the turn signal assembly. i soldered it back on, but the 
high beams dont change. the dimmer relay does click however...if the relay 
got messed up by the wire coming loose (or water going in...I read that that 
happens), could it still click but not change the high beams?
thanks
wink
