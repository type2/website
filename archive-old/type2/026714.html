Subject: RE: Installing VDO oil pressure sender on Type 4 engine?

Sorry all, I got the answer from the supplier of the VDO.  He recommends
installing a 1/8NPT adapter into the engine case hole, a 4&quot; extension pipe,
and a &quot;Y&quot; adapter into which I can insert the original &quot;dummy light&quot; sender,
and the new VDO sender.  It also seems that I needlessly ordered the nylon
tubing kit (for a mechanical sender/guage) since my sender and guage are
electric.  Live and learn.  Off to the hardware store!

---
&gt; I am completing the re-assembly of my type 4 engine (73 Bus) and bought a
VDO oil pressure sender and guage for it.
&gt; The kit comes with a sender that screws into the place where the original
sender goes, a tubing that connects the sender to the guage which is mounted
in the dash.  My problem is the following: the tinware hole above the oil
pressure sender hole is too small to accomodate the VDO sender.  How do
people resolve this problem?
&gt; 1. enlarge the tinware hole?
&gt; 2. install some kind of pipe fitting extension in the oil pressure sender
hole to that the sender sits above the tinware?
&gt; I was thinking of doing something along the lines of option 2, but will
welcome any suggestion of how to best do this.  Thanks!
