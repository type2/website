Subject: engine displacement

Good morning and weekend...
I have 2 possibly dumb questions but I'm not totally awake yet.
 
1) I have a 73 type IV Progressive..how do I know what displacement it is?  I know that it is not the original but from a later year..how do I know if it's a 1700/1800/2000?  Can I look up the # off the engine to find out what year it is and will that be the answer?
 
2) also, just wondering..what is the diff. between the 1600 upright and the Type IV's (besides displacement)..what makes them &quot;upright?&quot; 
I'm new, forgive me
