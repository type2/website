&gt; I have done it myself, twice a few months ago.
&gt; You can take the cooling housing off, and access the oil cooler.  I drive
a
&gt; 1973 with a 1800 cc just like yours.
 &gt; I was surprised how relatively easy it was.

That's easy for you to say :)
Try the same job in a 914, where the fan housing
will not remove so easily, but still doable.
In fact, the 914 cooler seals can be replaced
without loosening the fan housing, I've done it
Mostly necessary when there is an AC belt involved

( And we liked it :)
