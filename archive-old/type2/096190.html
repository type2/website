&gt; This thread on Mexi-buses reminded me of a question
&gt; I've been meaning to ask:  If I were to go to Mexico, would
&gt; I have any problem coming back into the US with a small truckload
&gt; of things like new cylinder heads, P/Cs, rods, etc...?
&gt; 
&gt; Also, I assume these things are available at Mexican parts houses, what
&gt; types of prices could I expect?  Would it be worth the trip/trouble?

remember the 2 liter engine wasn't sold in Mexico so parts are likely to
be non obtainable...
