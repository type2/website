Subject: Re: Alcohol + Bus

Hi Folks,

The only time I've had any contact with the police while drinking in a Bus 
was in St. George, Utah.  A friend and I were there for the weekend to buy a 
Bus for him, and we had just finished a hard day's work removing the engines 
and transmissions from both his old Bus and the new one.  This was in a 
condo complex parking lot, and somebody had called the police because there 
were 2 &quot;hippie types&quot; drinking in their parking lot -- in a VW Bus, no less!

We told the officer we were buying one of the Buses and would be gone by the 
end of the weekend, and were there with the PO, so it ended up as a 
nonissue.  He told us to make sure he didn't see us driving around that 
night after drinking, and we told him we wouldn't have an engine in either 
Bus until the following day.  I guess ours was a special case, but he didn't 
seem to have much of a problem, even for Utah.

As always, YMMV.  Good luck!
