Hi Bob,

Seattle is a pretty big place.  I'm sure bowwow has them, but they are
expensive.  If you are going down south past the airport, I would recommend
you phone Autosport or Oval's... both are more competitive on price.

I have a Seattle VW area web page at:

Also note that almost all the flaps are closed on Sunday :)

You can also mail order too.  I'm doing Internet work with Ronnie in Arizona
at http://www.OldVolks_dot_com/ -- consider that as an option!  You could
probably have it at your place by Monday at the same cost :)

Hi,  I can't find a pertronix in Vancouver BC these days as all FLAPS are
out of stock here. I am going to Seattle this weekend and would like to pick
one up there. Can a listee between Bellingham and Seattle advise of who
might have them?Preferably at a competitive price.  Bob
