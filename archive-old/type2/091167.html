Subject: Leaky Valve Covers

Morning, Frank

Tell you what I do with mine, and it works for me.

I have seen the bail wire that holds the valve covers
on upside down.  Mess with them to see that they are
on right.  I got rid of the chrome valve covers that
PO put on the bus because the bail wires didnt have
the proper &quot;angle&quot; to really seat well.  Stock covers
and bail wires worked the best.

Always new gaskets.  Take the valve covers off and
clean, clean, clean.  Make sure any old gasket sealer
used to hold on the old gaskets is removed, scrape and
lightly sand the area so you cant see any scratches,
etc...

Attach new gaskets to covers with a good gasket
sealant.  Allow to dry.  Clean the seating area on the
heads and lightly sand til smooth.

Put valve covers on and hold in position, while moving
the bail wires into place.

Works for me.
