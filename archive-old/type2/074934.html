&gt;On the Type 4 2.0L engine, there are two holes on the oil cooler housing
where the oil cooler is attached to the engine.  Can someone tell me how
the oil is routed?  Is the top hole for oil OUT or IN?  I am trying to set
up and remote oil cooler and need to know how the oil flows through those
two ports.

Don't know, John. What I do know is you can fill the crankcase with oil and
hit the starter and you will surely know which is which when the gusher
gets going. I suspect that if you don't have a bench adaptor to put a
starter on it, you could pour oil in each of the holes to prime them, then
turn the motor over by hand to see which one is which.
