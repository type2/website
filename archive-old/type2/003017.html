Subject: Too much oil

Volks:
My 71 Westy is using too much oil, It doesn't seem to be burning it, and
although it has a leak it is very, very minor. The engine is running great,
good fuel economy. but every 100 miles or so, I need to add about half a
quart. Any ideas? Thanks in advance

Vic
PS.
I realized that the oil was low when the light started flashing-on when I
took a tight curve.
