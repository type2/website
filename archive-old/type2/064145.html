Subject: Dutch Translator Required

Dutch translator reqd. 
To be paid in Karma :-)

There is VW content!!

I have acquired some Split Screen bus original sales brochures,
but a couple of them are in Dutch. I have already roped Pim
Van Loon into translating them, but as I type them out (quite
difficult to do in a language you don't understand!) I wonder if
it isn't just too much for 1 person.

One day I'll get round to scanning &amp; uploading these things. 
It goes without saying that anyone who helps will get full credit
for doing so.

Any takers?

Sarah
