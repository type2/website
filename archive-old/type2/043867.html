All,
	This happened on my old 66, sitting a long time the inside of the pipes
swell and finally close. I always replace them in a found bus

&gt;problem still existed, turned out to be the hose, guess they can constrict
&gt;to nothing  given enuf time, or also start to deteriorate to create 'check
&gt;valves' inside the hose.
