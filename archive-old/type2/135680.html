Subject: Some freebies in Anaheim, CA

I need to clean up my crapola soon for my move to Denver. So...

I have a tired front bumper from my 73. Many layers of crap paint and
one end is bent: http://www.donimages_dot_com/1973bus/front-before.jpg ...
It can probably be bent straight, sanded/stripped, and repainted to
look half decent. I have new chrome bumpers (that are ALREADY
RUSTING!!!) so don't need to save this...

I also have a pair of 73 Westy louvered windows. I have sliders to
swap in, and if you come before I get the sliders in, then the price
is your assistance in getting my sliders installed. (Just stand there
and hold the window in place while I pull the cord.. LoL!)

These are free for you to pick up in Anaheim, CA. I don't think the
louvered windows are really shippable, so come get 'em!

I'll be gathering more bits as I clean up my backyard.
