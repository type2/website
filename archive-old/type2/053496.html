   Just a note to say that our German Accents VW Club in Melbourne
&quot;caravan'd&quot; (9 VW families) to Lakeridge Winery last year for Harvest

Festival and it was absolutely great!  Was one of the nicest VW
family
events we've had.  Weather was quite warm, but the winery tour, arts
and
crafts vendors, food vendors, live music, grape-stomping contests,
and
great people made it all worth it.  Hope those of you who haven't
been to
Lakeridge Winery take advantage of, and enjoy, this wonderful
opportunity!
