Subject: Re: [T2] idiot light

Hi Kevin,

Mine was doing the same thing last year, not too long before it quit.  
If the alternator is more than 8 years old, I'd suggest to not waste $ 
$$ on a gauge, just get the alternator rebuilt. I had a 70A  
alternator rebuilt last year by a local shop for about $125... They  
cleaned it up and rewound the armature, replaced the diode pack and  
the bearings. it looks like new and works perfectly.


Happy Trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; Hey, guys.   My idiot alternator light is coming on more and more  
&gt; at idle lately.  Is that a symptom that the alternator is on its  
&gt; way out?  It was on the bus when I bought it 8 years ago.  Where  
&gt; does it actually measure the voltage?  In the guage itself?  The  
&gt; alternator still works fine otherwise.  And I've got a good  
&gt; battery. Never considered putting in a real voltmeter. May have to  
&gt; rethink that.   Thanks...KR
