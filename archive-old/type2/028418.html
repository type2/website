&gt;I was wondering if any of you know anything about the
&gt;odometer/speedometers for the early Bays. I found one and would like to
&gt;know if they are rare, or common. Were they available all years? Dealer
&gt;option or factory? Any info would be nice. I am not interested in selling
&gt;it, just finding out more about it.


CAn you send me more info about this, I might have one and would like to be
sure... Barry Wright
