Subject: pertronix wiring

could anyone tell me the proper wiring for a pertronix?  Do you need to run a resistor wire or ballast resistor with a blue coil? I found a unit in a box of stuff that came with some carbs i bought for my '75 bmw 2002.  It fits the bosch breaker plate and says 24P-S on the module.  Although I thought all vw's used the 1847 series? Paul.
