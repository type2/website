Gentlepersons-
                       The Road &amp; Track 100 best cars of 100 years lists the 
Beetle (natch),
as well as the Bus. That's two for me so far...As well as my Bugeye/Frogeye 
(Austin-
Healey Sprite '58-61 models), and my Morgan (being rebuilt in my basement). 
Since
Morgan made their really big change in '36, going from three wheels to four, 
not a lot
different from my '62 4/4. Now if only the Karmann Ghia had made the cut...
