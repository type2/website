Hi All!
I have several pieces of glass from what I guess must have been a 70 bus. I 
kinda inherited them in a lot of parts i bought for my bus. I don't need 
these though! Looks like the rear four...not jalousies though. Do have vent 
windows. I'll be glad to give them to anyone who is willing to come get the 
lot of them. I'm in Southern Maryland, I'll be willing to meet someone 
closeby (40 miles or so) if you are interested..as the folks house is hard to 
find!

I'll probably come across lots more stuff to give away as I start to clean 
out my garage before I move to Germany. I'll only be there three years, so I 
think the aircooled VW's stay, but have to make more room!

Anyone interested, let me know (preferably off the list!)
