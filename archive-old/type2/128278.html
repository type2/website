&gt; 1) I have looked in the Library, and I have even checked the Bosch website
&gt; itself; both state that I should have either a 0 231 167 055 or 0 231 173
&gt; 001 in my bus. Two very reliable sources in my area -- one of which only
&gt; does VWs -- say that they cannot lay their hands on these and that the 0 231
&gt; 178 009 (with no vacuum lines) I have in there is fine, really. It should
&gt; give better performance, they say. I understand from looking in the Library
&gt; that an 009 *may* work... (remember: no flame war, please)... but is it
&gt; really the *best* thing to have in there? I've seen other possible
&gt; aftermarket options, like ANC's SVDA

the 009 will work just fine. You have an upright engine so the advance
curve (while not load sensing like the vacuum advance ones) will be
about right. You shouldn't have to worry about burning up the engine
with it, at least. That aside I have one of ACN's SVDAs and love it.
They push features like improved gas mileage and cooler running
engine. I keep track of my gas and temps. I did not see really any
change in fuel economy, but a tremendous change in drivability and
engine temp. while the 009 will get you there having a vacuum advance
distributor is a great investment.

&gt; 3) My bus must have originally come with an AE engine case. What came with
&gt; it when I bought it was a fresh AM type from a local bug shop. The Library
&gt; states that this is a *possible* case for 1600s, but, again, I wonder if it
&gt; is the right or best one for mine.

The big thing with engines in early baywindow buses is the ability to
mount the mustache bar to the engine. This supports the rear of the
engine and should be attached. I don't know if the AN is a universal
case, but if so the bar should be attached to provide support. Other
than that anything goes :)

&gt; Okay, those are my questions for now. Any opinions and subsequent advice
&gt; would be helpful and appreciated.

congrats on getting it all back together, a task not to be taken
lightly :)
