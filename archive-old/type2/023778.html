Subject: Re: replacing exhaust manifold gaskets
Date: Tue, 3 Jul 2001 13:15:54 +0100 

Hi Missy,

 I'm thinking that these are the oval copper gaskets?

 The basics are simple- unbolt the heat exchangers, remove the old gaskets,
install new ones and reinstall. As you're probably anticipating, however,
this
description can hide a range of challenges which need to be overcome.

 I've done this a couple of times. Each time I've ended up dismantling the
exhaust system, as I couldn't (or didn't even try to) remove the exchangers
with the silencer (muffler) in place. It's possible your system is more 
complicated than mine (I only have the two exchangers, silencer &amp; tailpipe-
no catalytic converter or sidebox) which might present another option for
disconnecting the exchangers.
 You should use plenty of penetrating oil on the exchanger nuts (some
recommend
lots of heat, too: I havn't tried that) and get a good, tight fitting socket
on them. Don't worry too much if the stud comes out with the nut (you can 
reseat or replace it) but try to avoid shearing them off, if you can, as
that
will present another challenge to overcome... :-(

 Once the exchangers are off you can clean up the mating faces and make sure
everything's nice and smooth so it will seal all round. I've seen a 
recommendation to file an edge into the exchanger face so that it cuts into 
the gasket slightly for a good seal, but havn't tried it. It might be worth
doing if it won't compromise the flatness of the sealing faces.

 The two mating faces where the exchanger goes onto the gaskets should be
flat in the same plane as each other, if you see what I mean. They both have

to mate up to the exhaust ports, so getting them individually flat is only
half the battle.
 A smear of grease on the gaskets will hold them in place while you offer 
them up to the heads. I fit the exchangers to the heads and then worry about
getting the exhaust to attach to them- I'd rather file out the mounting
flange
on the silencer than risk a poor exhaust port seal.

 If you need to remove the silencer: I've found that a nut splitter- a
little
tool with a ring that goes over the nut and a chisel-head that's driven into

the nut with a bolt is effective on the top nut- it can be a pig
to get at and rusts badly. Access through the engine seal slot.

 You'll probably be gathering that it's useful to have replacements for some
of the parts you'll be attacking- silencer gaskets, exhaust nuts, washers,
exhaust studs (funny size? 8mm/9mm) and so on.

 Compared to this the steering coupler is a breeze- undo the outer part of 
the steering column (two screws at the base in the cab) and lift it up to
get access. Undo the four nuts&amp;bolts that hold it to the column base &amp; the 
steering box (watch out for the horn connection wire). Slide out the old 
coupling and replace (trying to avoid rotating the steering wheel), then
tighten it all up again and replace the bits you moved for access. Early
vans had split pins on the nuts but my '77 doesn't.
 Check the horn (and the indicator (turn signal) cancelling) when you're 
done.

 I don't know anything about fitting gauges. I live in a cool climate and
feel that adding gauges is complexity (failure points) that I don't need.

HTH: good luck!

Cheers,
	W.
