Subject: Re: [T2] NJ inspection woes

Re inspection in NJ-  You can cover (bridge) rusty areas with aluminum
body tape (it comes in 4&quot; rolls) and touch up with the same color tape.
This worked for me in rocker areas.  Regarding seats, I never knew they
looked that close, but I use pile seat covers that feel great (warmer in
winter, won't get you singed when in the sun) that would likely hide any
seat imperfections.

&gt; My '77 just failed safety inspection due to the rust (&quot;no sharp edges
&gt; allowed&quot;) and because my front seat springs/frame is poking through.  Short
&gt; of having the rust fixed and replacing my front seats, the bus will never
&gt; pass inspection.
