Subject: Shims on generator/fan

Hi, y'all.  Got a question to see if any of you have
run into this.

Yesterday I changed my carb/intake
manifold/distributor back to stock on my 70
Sportsmobile (1600 dual port).

When I pulled the generator/fan assembly, I noticed 1
shim on the generator side of the fan and 3 shims on
the side towards the front of the bus, next to the
retaining nut.

My 71 KG (1600 dual port) only has 1 shim on each side
of the fan assembly.

I would think that having that many shims on the nut
side doesnt effect the position of the fan in the fan
housing?

Any ideas why this would be??
Should I remove them??
What have you all found?

Thanks,
Chuck
