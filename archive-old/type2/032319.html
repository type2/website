&quot;POR&quot; is a rust converter product that has received rave reviews from
restorers.  Mar Hyde has a product that comes in an aerosol can.  Mar Hyde
is great for those hard to get at places, but doesn't provide the film
depth/coverage that the POR product does.
One of the acid products I used Years ago was called Rust Mort.  The
labeling on all these products will have info re: acid - rust converter.
Most rust converters change color when they come in contact with rust to a
dark black.
Mar Hyde is sold in most automotive stores like Als or Schucks or whatever
and are less expensive than the products sold in an automotive paint
supply store.  POR-15 is not cheap, and I find the aerosol spray to be
better for sheet metal surfaces that will be painted.  The POR product
does especially well in those areas that are somewhat hidden and take
quite a bit of road abuse, like fenderwells, front/rear suspensions,etc.
It's important to note that once these materials are applied, should you
scratch their surface, the possibility of rust getting in there increases.
I would perform all needed body work and just prior to squirting on the
primer, then shoot it with a rust converter.  It will penetrate the
porous bondo compounds and react with the sheet metal underneath.
You cannot use an acid product after body work is completed.
