&gt; &gt; &gt; OK, it's Friday....
&gt; &gt; pushing my 65 Westy up Red Mountain Pass at night in Colo on two lane US
&gt; &gt; 550 out of Silverton to Ouray.

Well its not Friday anymore, but I'm still awake.  Next time you're in
Colorado, try the &quot;shortcut&quot; between Aspen and Leadville: Hagerman Pass.
Not open in winter, not graded in summer (in August 99).  Busted the spade
connector off of my sump plate temp sender. Jeep Cherokees turned back in
despair, but the good old type2 made it.  There was a buggy up there too.
11512 I think!

Will and '70 Westy &quot;Rebertha&quot;

PS. I wouldn't do it again.
