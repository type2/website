Furthermore:

&quot;The camshaft for dual-carburetor or fuel injection engines used with manual
transmissions are different from those used with automatic transmissions. The
camshaft for engines used with auto. transmissions have two narrow bands cast
into shaft on each side of the center bearing journal.  Camshafts for Hyd.
lifters have no cast bands at the center bearing.&quot;

I can find no information about lobe positioning or height/radius.
