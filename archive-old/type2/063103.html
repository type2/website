Come on, guys! Waving has way more to do with the culture in which you're
traveling than with the type of vehicle you drive. Granted, you may get a
wave simply because you're driving a vehicle the waver identifies with.
Rorty (some anal-retentive guy who studies social groups and is
nearly worshipped in academe) might say that you share that same
worldview.

But try this simple experiment. Drive through a busy area...or better yet,
go some place where people fear each other. Try waving. (In some parts of
LA County I understand, this should not be done in an unarmored vehicle.) 
Now drive out to &quot;the country.&quot; Try waving. 

In many parts of Arkansas, waving is mandatory. It's considered rude if
you don't wave...at EVERYBODY! **I'm serious!** You can get away with the
one-finger (*index finger*, guys!) wave if you don't know the person, but
still, you MUST wave...and if you miss a chance to wave, you're sure to
feel guilty...or go to hell, or something like that.

I don't know about all this waving exclusively between bus lovers. Why not
wave at everyone? Can't we all just get along? ;) Joe
