Subject: Re: idle problem in 73 dual carb

&gt; I believe
&gt; it's purpose was to prevent run-on after the key is shut off

That's what Bentley says. I been studyin' the sh!t outta carbs lately,
so it's fresh in my mind. 

Thanks to everyone who gave me the low-down on adjusting and
synchronizing. Funny thing -- the more info I got, the more it makes
sense. I was afraid of sensory overload.

Now that I've got valve adjusting down, I guess I need a fresh hell.
Carbs it is. :-)
