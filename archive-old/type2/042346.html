Hi Volks,

I recently acquired a little book, smaller than an owner's manual, published
by VW, which ...&quot;contains all major measurements and adjustments for Type1
,2, and 3 Volkswagens imported into the USA and Canada from 1960 through
1970. (there is a second volume for later models)

For all concerned about oil pressure, the factory spec. for a new engine is
42 psi _at_2500 rpm with SAE 30 wt. oil at 70 deg.C. with a wear limit to 28
psi.

Oil consumption 1.7 -4.7 pints per 1000 miles.

More factoids to come........ TBear

Don't take life too seriously- you'll never live through it.
