&gt;faith wrote about her unnamed 71 transporter:
&gt;I have a major oil leak going on and since I was out
&gt;of town, a friend looked underneath and told me he
&gt;thought it was coming from the differential...

&gt;I'm really new at this, but in looking at the weir
&gt;book, i couldn't see where oil was really involved in
&gt;the differential...besides thicker, grease oil...
&gt;any advice on this?

Wow, you must have the special VW book entitled
What A Long Strange Trip Its Been, by B. Weir -good job on that
rare find!!

The most common leak is from the Rear Seal where the front of the
engine connects with the transmission (differential, in your case)
you can usually spot the oil dripping down from the crack between
the two components. If your leak is regularly bigger than an Eisenhower
Dollar you should consider replacing the &quot;rear main seal&quot; which is
actually the seal in the Front of the Engine (Front is Front per Weir)
of course, you can also drive forever like this - depends on if you consider
oil on the street the same as your own blood. If the leak is farther forward
(toward the front seats) or if it is thicker and smellier than your normal
oil, then you are looking to replace the transmission input shaft seal, but
if you have a major leak - it's probably coming from this area, and you should
consider pulling the engine to replace one or both seals, check endplay &amp;
renew the clutch (per Weir/Muir) good luck
