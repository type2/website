Subject: Re: [T2] a few more questions

Matthew Kirk sends:

&gt; now, what grade of oil should i be running in a 76 FI 2.0? i currently run HD
&gt; SAE 30 non-synthetic (cash issues). it seems to work ok. i also add STP oil
&gt; treatment every now and again, i figure it cant hurt, please let me know if it
&gt; can.

STP can't help either. The oil available today has a very good additive
package already; why add anything else to it?

As far as grade, that 30-wt non-synthetic is fine. Following some
suggestions on this list, I have switched from Castrol to Shell Rotella T,
which is working great, thanks guys. Two caveats: it's not sold in every
store--Wal-Mart doesn't have it--and it's not sold in quarts. It's intended
for large diesels that hold 11 to 13 gallons of oil, so it comes in gallon
jugs. NAPA has a neat little oil can that works wonders for the Rotella user
who doesn't need the whole jug.
