&gt;Hey sean, The thing I like most about that powerstroke is the 2nd gear take
&gt;off's just like first gear, even with 1,000 pounds of goodies in the cargo
&gt;area...

Also would like to know, Jake, how many miles thus far on a powerstroke do
you know of??? A lot would depend upon the right foot of the driver I'm
sure as to reliability of not only the motor, but the tranny and CV's and
such. Husky torsion and roll bars sound in order to push the G's uphill
through the corners without losing momentum. Load range D tires for sure to
cut down on the sway and waffling seems a necessity as well. What do you
run for rubber???
