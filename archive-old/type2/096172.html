Subject: Re: [T2] piston/cyl cleaning &amp; resto

&gt; I'm in the thick of my first rebuild here, and now I'm down the pistons &amp;
&gt; cylinders.  The main problem with the engine has been the head (the 3/4
&gt; side needs to be rebuilt, since the #3 exhaust valve seat dropped).  So,
&gt; The cylinders are pretty rusty on the outside, but seem to be fine
&gt; inside (ie: no obvious signs of wear such as scoring or strange wear

as soon as they get hot the rust will be &quot;burned&quot; ?? off

&gt; So, what types of solvent can/should be used to clean these parts up?  How
&gt; do I scrape off the burnt carbon deposits?  I am afraid to scratch the
&gt; pistons too much.

3M trico well   (I like grade 7S)

&gt; As for the cylinders, I'd like to eventually paint these black to help
&gt; with heat dissipation once they are cleaned.  What kinds of paint can be
&gt; used on these rusty things?  Will POR-15 work or will these get too hot?

leave em bare metal
&gt; 
&gt; Sure would be nice to get fancy new cylinders (check these guys out:
&gt; http://www.lnengineering_dot_com/) to help cut down heat, but $750+ seems a
&gt; bit steep ;^)
