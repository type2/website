Hi,

   can anyone advise regarding my dual carbs (solex 32-34 pdsit-2)?
My emmisions are way over the British limit and my local garage tell me that 
there is no adjustment on the left hand one, due to it being worn. Thing is: 
what is worn and can I strip the carb down and replace whatever it is? Is there 
a small spare part involved which is obtainable? Much obliged for any answers 
to the above-
              Miles

              Suffolk, United Kingdom.
