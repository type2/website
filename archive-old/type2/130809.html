Subject: RPM Question

I have a '72 Transporter with a 1700cc pancake. I just put in a
tachometer this past weekend to get an idea of how many rpms I'm running
while cruising on the highway. Switching through the gears doesn't seems
to cause me any alarm but when I reach cruising speed of about 65mph I
am registering my rpms at about 3800. Does this seem a little high or
within an acceptable range. I know that on my non-VW vehicle. I need to
be in excess of 80mph before I even hit 3000 rpms. Any thoughts? Any I
potentially causing any harm at such a high rpm?

Chris
