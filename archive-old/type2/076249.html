&gt; &gt;   The square box type is the ones used in the buses this is the BN-4
&gt; 
&gt; My memory of BN-4s is of a torpedo or tubular shape, not a box and not
&gt; square.  The Borg-Warner is kinda box shaped.  Are we just thinking
&gt; differently in description?

I think so, the BN-4 fits into the left rear corner of the bus, the BA-4
fits over the rear axle of the 411/412    the BA-6 fits under the
bus.  the BA(BN) 2 I don't know what it looks like.
