Subject: Re: [T2] Trip Report: The Estes Park Day Trip That Wasn't

I had a feeling it was going this direction.....

Does she think other cars don't break down? How many broken down late
model vehicles have we passed in our buses?

And how do you put a value on the fact that you know your bus inside
and out and really keep on top of keeping things in tip top shape?
Many people can't even afford to take their cars to the shop to keep
them running let alone safe and in top form.
