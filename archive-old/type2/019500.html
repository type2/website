Hi Eric,

At light throttle cruise you can run the full advance of 38 - 40 degrees
with the mech / vac distributor.  When you get into a load condition or
full throttle application, your vacuum falls to 0, or near 0, degrees
and you are in effect using only the mechanical portion of your
distributor which is engine speed dependent.

To fine tune a mech / vac distrib for your specific engine requirements
and available fuel, you disconnect and plug the vac advance hose to the
dist. at the carb.  Load the bus up to near its max weight, find a long
steep hill and accelerate (uphill) in 3rd gear listening for ping.
Advance initial timing to your ping point then retard 2 - 3 degrees.
reconnect the vac advance.  Several after market performance advance
kits instruct in just this method.  (As far as I know, these performance
kits are only available for domestic (USA) distributors.)  You could
fine tune the mech dist the same way. I have a Sun distributor machine
and can set up custom advance curves.  You can speed up or slow down the
rate of advance and total distributor advance in any VW mechanical or
mech / vac advance distributor to match your individual requirements.
The specs given for the various vac advance units help me adjust for my
particular engine.

Anyone out there remember the 60's  and early 70's Japanese cars and
trucks?  Most came with a vernier type adjustment screw to externally
adjust the distributor to its ping point as specified in the Owner's
manual as part of a regular tune up.  It was always great to work on
those as the instructions called for full throttle accelleration runs to
adjust.  &quot;Honest officer, it says right here, I have to drive like
this.&quot;

If you are traveling to an area (Mexico) where the supply of premium
fuel is in question,  follow this method with a regular grade of
gasoline and note the timing for future refference.  That will give you
a premium setting and a regular setting.  The book specs are only a
starting point.  Almost any rebuilt heads have been fly-cut and
compression is increased over stock requiring less advance.  If the
heads were not cc'd, the deck height checked, and the compression ratio
calculated, you have no idea of what it is.Some of the factors effecting
spark advance are: engine load, engine speed, engine temperature,
cylinder bore diameter, compression ratio, volitility of the fuel,
air-fuel mixture, knock rating of fuel, and others which escape me at
the moment.

Does this help, or did I just add mud to the water?

By the way, I received a rebuilt GEX head from Rocky Mountain and upon
checking, found the combustion chamber volume to be off by 3 CC's in the
same head.  Took a lot of careful machining to match the chamber volume.
That is why I use new heads when available.  The extra material appeared
to be a result of the welding repairs to the spark plug and valve seat
areas.  Take a close look inside the ports of a rebuilt head and compare
to new.  You might be surprised.

I will try again if this is not clear.

Keep smiling,

Mike

&gt; Hi Mike:
&gt;
&gt; Sorry for the delayed response to this thread, I'm catching up.
&gt;
&gt; Mike Dwyer wrote the stuff quoted below, but what really caught my eye
&gt;
&gt; was the part that went: &quot;...  That is why you can time a combination
&gt; vac
&gt; and mech unit to a total advance of 38 - 40 degrees BTDC and a Mech
&gt; only
&gt; unit to 30 - 32 degrees BTDC at full advance.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; The problem is, after re-reading this a few times, I still don't see
&gt; why
&gt; you can time the mech/vac to a higher total advance.  Are you saying
&gt; that the 'extra' eight degrees of advance is ok because it is in
&gt; effect
&gt; when you are timing the engine but not when you are cruising at
&gt; highway
&gt; speed?
&gt;
