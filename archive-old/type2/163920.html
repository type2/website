Subject: Re: [T2] seat belts in a splitty

&gt; I just put a back seat in my 1960 bus and was wondering how you guys are
&gt; doing seat belts.  Are you drilling holes in the floor? or attaching belts
&gt; to the
&gt; seat frames?
&gt;
Floor...With plenty of spacers to spread the load out would be my guess...I
wouldn't trust the frame to hold much in case of a severe shock load... ;-(
