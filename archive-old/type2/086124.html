Subject: RE: [T2] Rear side taillight for 79 Bus

&gt; I am searching for a passenger side, rear SIDE tail
&gt; light (the small red one).  I need to buy the cover,
&gt; as well as the housing.  I have been unable to find it.

&gt; They are hard to find in any decent shape at all.
&gt; West Coast Metric has the lens, but I don't think the
&gt; holder is made anymore.

&gt;  I bought a set of the lenses and bulb holders from
&gt;  the Bus Depot not very long ago.


And I still have them.  The rear side marker housing/bulb holder is $19.95
(part # 211 945 351A).  The lenses are available in either red (rear lense)
or orange (front), each with your choice of silver or black trim, for $9.95
each.  (Part numbers 211 945 363 for red or 211 945 119 for orange - add
either an &quot;A&quot; to the end of the number for silver trim, or a &quot;B&quot; for black
trim.)   Prices will be 5% cheaper if your order exceeds $50, as the
listmember discount kicks in.
