Subject: RE: [T2] Overheating your air-cooled bus

X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL



&gt;With all the recent talk of gasoline additives and how driving
&gt;your bus at 55 mph during the summer might be a good idea to 
&gt;prevent overheating, I was wondering how adding a modified, 
&gt;higher-volume, sump would effect this problem.  

Adding a sump will only work on Buses with an upright type engine(pre 72). I
do not know of any deep sumps for a type 4 engine (at least one readily
available in the USA).
The deep sump will slightly lower temps if all other factors are the same,
mainly they give more oil and oil is a &quot;coolant&quot; as well as air.
To take advantage of the extra oil, you would also want to install an extra
oil cooler. You would want this to be hooked up to a thermostatic valve so
it only cools the oil after it get to a set temp. If its 30deg outside, you
don't want to cool your oil right after start up, its way too cold as is. 

The main thing to do to offset the bad gas would be to install larger jets
for summer driving, back to normal for winter. Side affects would be slight
decrease in MPG. More fuel will make up for the added alcohol. It will also
help cool the heads. FI Buses(and Bugs) will require tweeks that are beyond
my abilitys. 

Basicly theres more to it than just &quot;bolt on&quot; some fancy dodad, figure out
why it overheats, then attack the problem. If you live where its realy hot
most of the time, extra measures may be required after everything else is
made in good working order.

Its amaizing how much difference it makes just fixing all those little hose
in the cooling tin and replacing that old worn and broken engine compartment
seal. My engine would turn on my GBE temp dipstick when I first got the car,
after just replacing the engine seal and pluging a few small hose in the
tin, I could drive faster and harder than before and never light the light.
No extra dodads, just fixed it to the way VW made it.
