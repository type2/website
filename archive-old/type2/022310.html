Subject: [T2] Installing an engine hatch 
Mime-Version: 1.0

The search is on.

I'm planning to install an engine hatch from a later model bus into my 1971 
Riviera camper. I have a 1980 Vanagon parts bus, but after measuring I see 
the engine hatch is just a bit too big. It measures almost 48 inches 
across. My bus has the cabinetry inside. Without it would not be a problem. 
I just had knee surgery. The thought of resting on my knees with my head in 
the engine compartment door does not sound appealing. The hatch is the only 
way to go.

Can anyone tell me what sizes are available on other models? Someone 
suggested a hatch from a Type 3. I remember the hatch from my 1974 was a 
bit smaller as well, but can't remember the size. Is there a list of sizes 
and model years around somewhere?

My plan is to take it to my local VW repair shop, have them remove the 
engine and gas tank. Deliver it to my favorite body shop and have them 
install the hatch and paint the engine compartment while they have it. Then 
it will go back to the repair shop to have the engine and tank put back.
