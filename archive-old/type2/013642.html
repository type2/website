Subject: FREE 81 poptop, still needs home (pics up)
Mime-Version: 1.0

OK to be fair I put some pics up (well actually David R did, thanks)
sorry the pics are monstrous, I emailed them from the parents
and had no way to condense them off the camera.

is the index the Pxxxxxx09 - 15 are the '81.  You MUST take the
entire van, you can sort of see the tow bar.  I got a lot of interest
but no definite takers.  Needs to be gone week of July 24-28 or
maybe I'd hold on till Aug 15-20 or so if you give me good
assurances.  I don't know folks, I've seen people say canvas a lot
worse than that is &quot;good.&quot;  You can (and should) take the entire
top structure, I say that as I've seen a rolled California Camper
vanagon, and I've rolled an '86 van, and I wouldn't have wanted to
be in the CA Camper.

also, the '87 is pictured in the other pics if anyone is interested in
the interior.  That is the condition it is in, but it has been full of junk
for 2 years since.  It would clean up to that condition.  Looking for
offers on it.  Both in northern WV.
