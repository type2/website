Subject: Counting VW's

&gt;From reading this dribble that apparently boost the ego's of those who have
more yard than sense, I have come to the conclusion that many of you
essentially own junkyards.  

Although this is a respectable vocation, I have to wonder how much profit
you are making from your assorted dying vehicles.  If your making none, I
guess it would be better to term it a &quot;graveyard&quot;.

I have an aquaintance here in Saint Louis that claims to be a collector of
VW's, yet all that he aquires he lets sit out in the elements rotting to
rust and dust.  

Many of the units were solid when he purchased them, but now they are
shells of their original selves.  Yet he refuses to sell any of them.  I
think this type &quot;collecting&quot; is an abomination in the sight of God, Dr.
Pon, and all of mankind.

PS:  I am only semi-serious folks.  I simply hate to see busses go to waste
all in the name of &quot;collecting&quot;.
