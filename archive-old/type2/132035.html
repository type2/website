Subject: Re: [T2] More foam seals - engine compartment

&gt; Hi Chris,
&gt; 
&gt; Forget the hardware aisle and head over to &quot;Sports&quot;. I was thinking
&gt; about trying a poly-urethane foam &quot;Swim noodle&quot; in this application.
&gt; Buy a 3&quot; diameter noodle and slit it lengthwise almost to the centre on
&gt; both sides.

for goodness sakes, the original seal is 30 dollars. i can understand making
the part if it is either very expensive or NLA, but this seal is neither,
and it is a critical part. it is available at any vendor that sell bus
parts.

hey, i am all for fabricating parts, on my thing restoration project i have
&quot;cheaped out&quot; in many places where taking apart and rebuilding or even
making from scratch was more cost-effective than buying a new part, but this
is not the place for this sort of experimentation.
