&gt;One thing that I think gets a bad rap is Bondo. When Bondo
and other like fillers are used properly, the repair is permanent and should
not pop off, crack or cause rust.


I am in accord with David.  From what I read, the modern fillers are much
better than the original formulas, which were similar to drywall mud.  They
keep a bad reputation because there are too many lazy people who slather
them on and do not take care to prepare the metal underneath.

According to PPG, the bond between the filler and DP epoxy primer and the
primer and clean metal is stronger than the bond of the filler directly
applied to bare metal.  I prefer to  strip parts, do the basic hammer work,
and then shoot epoxy primer and guide coats before filler.  The reason is
that when you shoot the primer and guides, you can begin to see additional
areas that you can address with the hammer, dolly and files.  With the
primer, the metal is not in danger of rusting during this period, which
allows you to take your time.  Once the metal work is finished, you can
reshoot the primer and then begin applying light patches of bondo.

Grant
