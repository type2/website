Subject: Re: [T2] Bleeding Lifters, without doing weird stuff!

Since I am surfeit in bicycles spokes, I recall using them to reassemble 
a lifter under oil- but that was 100,000 mi ago or so- I think I used 
one in the side bleeder hole to hold something down inside (the piston?)
  as I pushed from the top- or was it that I stuck it through the hole 
where the pushrod lets the oil in?  Don't have one in front of me, but I 
did not need a press!
------------------------------------------------------------------
quoth Zack:

What I did, and it was messy and a pain in the neck, was to
  disassemble the lifter, then reassemble under 40 wt oil.  The problem
  with this technique is that the bore is completely full of oil and it
  is impossible to push the socket far enough into the lifter bore by
  hand to install the circlip that holds the whole thing together.
