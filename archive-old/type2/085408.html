Subject: Vacation travels

Hmmmm....

This idea has merit. An Air-cooled Interstate Tourism Board perhaps????

Happy trails,

&gt;&gt; Now there ya go. If 'we' plan a vacation for one, then we outa just plan a
&gt;&gt; vacation for each and every one of us in our respective regions. I can see
&gt;&gt; it now, uh boss, two weeks isn't going to do it, the list said I need at
&gt;&gt; least four.
&gt; 
&gt; Chuck, that's exactly what I said in my original post!  four weeks is a
&gt; minimum!  The active thought here is that if you get back and you remember
&gt; your password, then you were *not* gone long enough! :-)
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Well we can dream can't we!
&gt; 
&gt; Indeed we can!  and *big* dreams!
&gt; 
&gt; I like the idea of assembling a list of regional sites by natives, BTW.
&gt; Each of us almost certainly knows sites near our homes that are fabulous,
&gt; but unknown to non-natives.  Here in DC, ferinstance, I would recommend
&gt; the Capitol Spring (center of the NE lawn of the Capitol), tho it is
&gt; probably guarded these days :-( and for those who think they have twisty
&gt; roads... I recommend Beach Drive!  :-)
