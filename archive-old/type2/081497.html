Subject: Re: [T2] Points keep frying...

Sounds like you need to add an external ballast resistor to lower the voltage
going into the coil. Almost all Bosch coils have an internal built-in
resistor. Most after market coils do not unless it says it has one on the body
of the coil.
Years ago I used to get a Delco D1110 resistor to fix this, but I am not sure
they are around any more. They were used on 55-57 Chevys. [I am dating myself]



&gt; Hey all...
&gt;
&gt; I'm usually pretty good at figuring things out myself, but I'm stumped on
&gt; this one. My points keep fouling after 50 - 100 miles.
&gt;
&gt; Here's what I have...
&gt;
&gt; (71?) Mexican 1600 w/Pict 30/31 Carb (new carb)
&gt; 009 Distributor
&gt;
&gt; What I've done...
&gt;
&gt; 1. New plugs, points, condensor, coil, wires, cap, rotor about 5 months ago
&gt; with less than 2000 miles since.
&gt;
&gt; 2. Broke down last month, replaced points (fried) and plugs (black) --
&gt; everything else looked good. Plugs were black due to old carb problems --
&gt; didn't replace plugs w/new carb install.
&gt;
&gt; 3. Broke down last week. Thought it was a fuel issue, but turned out to be
&gt; points -- replaced. Checked plugs -- beautiful condition.
&gt;
&gt; 4. Broke down yesterday. Points had a little of that solder-looking stuff,
&gt; filed it off (didn't have a new set on-hand), re-installed and she ran fine.
&gt;
&gt; Other info...
&gt;
&gt; 1. The coil is not the Bosch Blue -- it's a black one from the local FLAPS.
&gt;
&gt; 2. Plugs are Bosch (regular, not &quot;super&quot;).
&gt;
&gt; 3. Rotor, cap and wires are from FLAPS.
&gt;
&gt; 4. Points are Bosch
&gt;
&gt; 5. When she runs, she runs great -- smooth idle and acceleration, no
&gt; backfiring, no hesitation. When this happens, she basically just cuts out
&gt; without warning -- no sputtering, etc.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; What am I missing here? I know that points are a regular &quot;wear&quot; item, but
&gt; they've always lasted at least 5000 miles for me. Any ideas or suggestions
&gt; appreciated...
&gt;
