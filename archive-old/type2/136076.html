Subject: Trendy VW Bus marketing craze...

Well, yesterday my wife received a catalog in the mail
from the uber-trendy company &quot;Urban Outfitters&quot;.
Flipped through it and right in the middle, covering
the two open pages was a white late bay westy
surrounded by Urban Outfitters merchandise.
I'm am not sure if this kind of thing makes me sick to
my stomach or proud to have been on the &quot;Bus
Band-wagon&quot; before it became so trendy!!

Peace, John Baker

&quot;So we got into the red VW microbus with the shovels and the rakes and the implements of destruction and we headed on to the police officer's station...&quot;
