Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [VB] Wheel Powdercoating not a good thing?


&gt;Generally your vehicle handling will tell you something is wrong long 
&gt;before you separate from your wheel.  Ball joint separation or axel nut 
&gt;loss are more likely causes of lost wheels.

I drove a Volvo that lost a wheel. A friend had asked me to drive it and 
see it I could diagnose a wandering feeling it had. I got about half of a 
sentence out of my mouth about the lugnuts probably being loose and the 
wheel fell off. We went to the dealer and got new studs and nuts and all 
was well. No body damage.

Went to pick up a VW Beetle parts car and lost a front wheel on it. Didn't 
check those lug nuts.

Had a CR-X that aggravated me for a whole trip to and from TN (from 
Norfolk, VA) and I realized that the rear wheel bearings needed adjustment. 
Took care of a wandering feeling it had (I did check those lugnuts 
immediately!).

If anyone feels strongly about powdercoating leading to lugnut failure or 
loosening - then take a Dremel tool and sand the powdercoating off of the 
lugnut seating surface and/or the back of the wheel where it touches the hub.

You'll get some warning and you should be checking the lugnut torque 
regularly for a while anyhow.
