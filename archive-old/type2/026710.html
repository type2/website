Subject: thermostat for Type IV engine?
Date: Wed, 18 Jul 2001 09:14:16 -0400
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Hi,
Am rebuilding my 1800cc Type IV engine and decided it was worthwhile to put
a thermostat in.  I obtained a replacement cable, and tested the existing
thermostat (is supposed to open up at 65-70 degrees C, according to
Bentley).  It didn't open up, so I decided to order another one from the
dealership.  Tested it when I got home, and it also didn't open up.  Read
the fine print on the thermostat and it says &quot;85-90&quot;, which I know means
degrees C.  I checked the Bentley again, and the specs for the engine
indicate the thermostat should open at 65-70C.  The original thermostat on
my engine was also 85-90.
QUestion: is it safe to go ahead with the 85-90 range thermostat in my 1800
engine?  Is there actually a 65-70 range one available? (the VW dealer told
me this one is the only type that was left in their national warehouse).
Thanks,
  --Robert
