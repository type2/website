They all have bad dimmers. Is it the current that burns them up? If so how
about a control circuit that only draws minimal current from the switch
pot and supplies enough to keep the dash and whatever assc gauge lights

a couple other minor bits could swing it.
Or maybe I want to clap on clap off my dash lights? hmmmmm
