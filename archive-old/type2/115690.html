&gt; It's sometimes called a fuel pump or combi relay.
&gt; 
&gt; You need the 11-pin version. It's at least $60.

This is good info, richard.

If you can be a bit patient, and are willing to use ebay, this part is
available there for much less. It is used on a bunch of other cars and I
have seen them go for about 15 bucks. You have to scour carefully. If you
were to search for &quot;bosch relay&quot; right now you would not find one, but there
is a similar bosch relay for an alfa romeo that is selling for 12 dollars.
