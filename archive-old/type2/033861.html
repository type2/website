Subject: Operating Temperatures

Volks ,

   I finally figured out how to hook up my temperature gauge and was 
wondering what normal operating temperatures should be. The library talked 
about 71 1600ccs. I have a 72 pancake with 1800 P &amp; C s and found my temp on 
semi flat terrain to stabilize _at_ about 225-230 F with about 30 degree out 
side temperatures.
  Is this hot, cold or  normal.

  Thankyou,
    David
