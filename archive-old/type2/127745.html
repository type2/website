Matthew,

I had the same problem on my 71 Westy.. About 10 years
ago I decided to &quot;go electric&quot; and just added an
electric pump into the line off the tank (make sure to
mount pump BELOW tank so it's gravity fed/primed) and
put a switch on the dash.. It's still working great,
and it's more reliable than &quot;pumping up&quot; the tank
every time and putting stress on everything!!

It might be (like mine) that your switch is leaking,
and you'd need to bypass it anyway if you go with an
electric pump. You may have to replace the lines
anyway if they are perished, but if it's just the ends
then cut 'em off and refit them, hopefully they'll
still be long enough..

Think there are some &quot;kits&quot; now for this, although
I've only seen them for bugs and not for busses..

Good luck,
David Burton
