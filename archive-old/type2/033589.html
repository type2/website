Subject: Need help to pass emissions check

Hi all. I need some pointers on how to tune my '81 Vanagon to pass the
Ohio E-Check (emissions test). We tuned the van up before going, new
point, plugs, cap, rotor, air filter, timed to Bently spec. The only
thing I didn't do this time was run the &quot;Guaranteed to pass emissions&quot;
gas additive in the tank before taking the test. Here were my results:

                                Reading    Units    Limit    
HC:  (loaded - on dynomometer)  45.2       PPM      220.0    Pass
CO:  (loaded - on dynomometer)  2.45       %        1.20     Fail
CO2: (loaded - on dynomometer)  13.1880    %                 
HC:  (idle)                     50.0       PPM      220.0    Pass
CO:  (idle)                     2.40       %        1.20     Fail
CO2: (idle)                     12.7780    %                 

I recently put in a Tiger 581 CDI module, would this have a negative
effect? I assume that it would have been beneficial for the emissions.
Should I have reverted to the old ignition system before the test.
Also, I don't understand the relationship between timing and emissions.
Anyone care to give me a technical explanation of this? My hsuband the
engineer wants to know. I need to get this done quickly, as my plates
expire at the end of the month. Thanks in advance.
