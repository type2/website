Subject: new/rebuilt engines-where to buy
Message-ID: &lt;381519C7.3C34CE5A_at_cartsys_dot_com&gt;

hey, just a quick question:
where should i (or should i not) buy a rebuilt/new 1600dp engine for my
71?
i have been in the middle of a rebuild since this summer and just dont
have the time. any good/bad experiences? how much is it going to be? i
have a crankcase that ive got the machine work done on, and i have an
acceptable camshaft and pistons and cylinders that just need to be
re-ringed and honed. everything else i gotta buy; i think. any
suggestions? i m just worried about time, cash, and quality (i dont know
if i could do a good job with the limited time [1st rebuild] and if i
buy from someone else i want to know that i m getting quality). thanks a
lot!!
