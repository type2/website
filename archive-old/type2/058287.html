Subject: Re: Best accelerator pedal lube [was WD-40]

&gt;Yo,
&gt;
&gt;Did y'all know that the WD in WD-40 stands for Water Dispersion?
&gt;Eug

Doesn't. Stands for Wisconsin Deodorant. Wotate Dammit? Worry Despair?
Weasel drippings?

Actually I find that CRC 5-56 seems to attract less dirt and lubes longer
for things like the accelerator pedal and exposed cables, but I don't know
about loosening stuff and fighting rust. But seriously, what does work best
on those grubby pedal pivot points. I had a 68 once that actually chewed
through the hinges of the pedal because of all the dirt and water that sits
down there.

Don't get me started on what CRC stands for.

John
