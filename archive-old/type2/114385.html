Subject: RE: [T2] Condensation??

The drop in temperature of your intake manifold tubes and subsequent
condensation on the outside of the tubes is cause by the venturi effect
of the carburetor and the vaporization of fuel. Whether you have
problems depends on how and where you drive. If your air/fuel mixture
gets too cold, the fuel will re-condense before its gets to the
cylinders.... especially while idling. Since the engine isn't getting
the proper air fuel mixture it doesn't run right. If you were up north,
you'd probably be having problems during the winter. Because of the mild
climate you're in, you may never notice or have a problem. I'm not that
familiar with type IV engines, but, if they're anything like the type
II, typically aftermarket intakes don't go through the trouble of
installing intake manifold heater pipes. These pipes use hot exhaust to
warm the intake manifold thus keeping it from getting too cold. I don't
know if your intake is original or aftermarket. Another method of
warming your intake involves drawing intake air off the hot engine.
Factory filter boxes do this when the engine is cold. Maybe someone out
there can set me straight.
