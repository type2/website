&gt; Hello everyone.
&gt;   After many long hours I have finally got my new web page up. It is
&gt; completely different from the old site and has a slightly different
address.
&gt; Please go take a look and see what you think. I still need to add some
&gt; better pictures of the 71 Westy and the Vert, but it is a start. And just
so
&gt; you know, it was completely created useing only MS Notepad and a little
&gt; photo editing from Adobe photo shop 5.0. There is a nav bar that will take
&gt; you to the type 4 conversion page and one for the 71 westy, the other
pages
&gt; are Bug and a for sale page with nothing on it currently.
&gt;   Please let me know if something does not work right or needs correcting.
&gt; Today is its first day up and running.
&gt;
