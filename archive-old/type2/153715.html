Subject: Heat exchanger back for a 76 bus

I have been looking for exhaust for my the pickle my 1976 bus, and am running
into problems.  I appears this is a &quot;unique&quot; set up with the triangle three
bolt flange's coming off the exchangers.  The current set up appears
aftermarket, and the muffler says thunderbird on it. The problem is that it is
ugly rusty, and the support that was welded to the muffler fell off, and the
muffler is going to break off anyday now.

I like the looks and design of the dual tipped GT style from mid america, but
I am not sure if it has the correct flanges.  I have heard there is a system
called the pace setter, but just the name seems cheasy.

I want a good flowing system, that sounds and looks good.  It also must just
bolt on.  Any suggestions?

Thanks
Eric
