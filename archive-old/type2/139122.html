&gt;&gt;  I dig Richard's ratwell_dot_com site - lots of excellent write-ups!
&gt; 
&gt; Although I'm sure you will without prompting, be sure to thank Richard
&gt; for all the work that went into that site. Also, try to buy something
&gt; from Scott Lyons at German Supply, who provides some kind of
&gt; sponsorship for the site.
&gt; 
&gt; There are several suppliers who are helpful to type2_dot_com listees. Scott
&gt; is one. Ron Salmon at Bus Depot is another.

List,

germansupply_dot_com is not just me, in fact it was started by Collie, AKA
Collison Corner, who has been around this list a lot longer that I have. We
run it together, he is the brains, I am the muscle :-). About 6 months ago I
began doing most of the order processing, phone answering and email, and we
both love being part of the type2 list, which is great community.
