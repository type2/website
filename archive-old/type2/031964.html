A few years ago I installed 3 point seatbelts from a Rabbit (I think-
maybe an Audi of some sort- got 'em already removed form a junkyard) in my
1978 VW bus. I manufactured an L-shaped bracket with two holes to bolt the
seatbelt spool to and one bolt to the floor of the bus next to front
seats, outboard. I replaced my receivers on the inboard sides of the seats
with the junkyard ones since they don't quite fit the original ones. I
like 'em OK but there are at least three problems with them that my
passengers (most notably my luvin' wife) complain about chronically: 

Problem1- The lock is a tad sensitive. You have to pull them out slowly 
or they lock on you. I never have trouble with this, but the impatient 
jerk on them and complain every time.

Problem2- The Rabbit (or whatever) is a smaller car than the bus. There 
is barely enough belt to work in the bus. I run out of belt if I lean 
forward much. A large friend of mine doesn't have enough belt to buckle 
the thing. I can imagine ways to manufacture an attachment point for the 
spool end of the belt somewhere partways up the column behind the front  
doors, but then it might interfere with turning the passenger seat around 
to face aft. In any case the stock attachment location results in a lot 
of belt used up between the spool and the shoulder attach point. 

Problem3- the receivers are a bit low- my passengers are always fishing 
around looking for them and complaining. I have no problems.

Folks have been lobbying for years for me to &quot;solve my seatbelt problem&quot; 
when I thought I already had. I've found this solution to be less than 
optimal.

Your actual mileage may vary...
