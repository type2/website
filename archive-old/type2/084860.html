Oh boy - now you've done it. You've mentioned the dreaded T*re word!!!

That thread comes up so often that a tire question often causes the list to 
moan.

There are articles on this topic at:

www.type2_dot_com

and

www.vanagon_dot_com

I would suggest a search in both list archives as well. To give you an idea 
of the size of this topic - I subscribe to the Vanagon list and the Type II 
list and a couple of other VW lists. In just a couple of months I have 
collected about 2500 messages on this topic!

In short if the tire has a &quot;P&quot; anywhere in the size number then you don't 
want it. You need a stronger tire. The average tire store clerk hasn't a 
clue about what you need and will try to sell you a &quot;P&quot; tire. You will have 
to educate yourself. Archives and both list libraries.

Go check out Nokian tires.

When you've got specific tire questions holler back at me and I'll be glad 
to help you out.
