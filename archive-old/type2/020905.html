&gt; Howdy All,
&gt; It's official, my wife is going to kill me.  I bought another bus!  A 73 Westy.  My questiion is this :  I have a 75 Westy with good top, canvas and interrior but bad engine, the 73 I just bought has great engine ,sucky top &amp; canvas.  The 75 pop-top pops up with the front of top toward the cab going up, the 73 pops up opposite, when popped up the the front of the top is lower than the back.  So I want to put the 75 top on the 73 Westy.  Anyone done this?? Is it possible?  What problems might I face?  Will I ever get a brain??

John:
I believe there is substantial difference between the opening size of the 73 and 74 pop tops. 68-73's were made from sunroof equipped kombis (hence the 231 serial numbers). 74 up were made by cutting a bigger  hole in the roof, I believe. At least pop top Vanagons are and I believe clear back to 74 with the 2 person bed in the pop top.
The only practical answer here is to fix them both!!! It doesn't have to make financial sense to make sense.
Trust me, at only 5 VW's your marriage is still on firm ground!
