Concerning replacing the dash, it would be interesting to here from anyone 
who has rescued a dash from a donor vehicle and installed it.  I have located 
serveral decent donor dashes for my 69 bus ( mine is cracked on the oh-shit 
handle on the passenger side and several other places ).  I have wondered how 
difficult it is to install, obviously ripping a part out is quite easy ( 
especially if you do it the way some people hack them out ! )

Anyone ?
