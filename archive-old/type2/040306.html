Subject: starter RELAY

this seems to be a frequent thread, I'll answer it though,

the Bosch starter relay is not exactly like the Muir F*rd solenoid fix;
the relay just makes a low amp circuit to and from the key starter switch,
while making a short loop from the battery positive (starter terminal) 
wire to the solenoid. It does not draw big current throught the keyswitch.

The Bosch WR-1 kit is easy to install, has color coded wires and
instructions, and costs around 10 bucks if I remember correctly. I have
one; have experienced no starting problems since installation.

If you're crafty you can add a &quot;remote start&quot; button for the engine
compartment, but only if you're the type of person who parks with the
gearshift in NEUTRAL every time and always sets the e-brake--be sure to
double check.
