Subject: Removing fuel pump and stuff...

Hello,

This is my first question to this list, so if I break any unwritten
rules, please forgive me.  That, and the bad English.

I drive a 1979 Kombi equipped with a 2.0 liter engine. &quot;Dual&quot; Solex 34
PDSIT carburettors, mechanical fuel pump. Lately, she (&quot;VT&quot;, don't
ask) has developed problems with speeds over 70 kmh. (~40 mph?) It
takes up to a full minute, with the pedal floored, to get to 70 kmh,
and there she goes no faster.

Last weekend, I overhauled both the carburettors; adjusted, cleaned &amp;
lubricated them, but no sign of big trouble there. At idle the engine
runned more smoothly (progress!), but the car still didn't go any
faster.

My trusted Haynes indicated that maybe the fuel pump may be at fault.
Today, I tried to remove the fuel pump from the crankcase. My
questions start here:

* How in the world is one to undo the above bolt that holds the pump
to the crankcase? The Haynes simply states: &quot;clean, undo the hoses,
then remove the two bolts&quot;. I removed the hoses (no fuel spilling!),
but I can't reach the second, above, bolt! There seems to be an air
duct from the motor cooling (?) in the way, that I couldn't remove. I
can see the same thing on the picture in the Haynes, I must be doing
something wrong. Ideas?

* Since I figured that I might be able to reach to the second bolt if
I removed the first one, I did just that, but then oil started pouring
out! It it supposed to do that? Haynes doesn't mention it at all. I
cought most of it in a cup, it is quite fluid. I let it flow for more
than a minute, but it kept on flowing, so I put the lower bolt back
in. I have searched the type2 archive, but did not find a message
mentioning that. I did find more than one reference to gas leaking
into the oil via the fuel pump. Is that what is happening here? My
dipstick does smell gas-like.

* Any other reasons why my engine lacks power? I didn't check the
air-tightness on the manifolds yet, I postponed that.
