Subject: Everybus anyone passing through Ohio?

Hey Volks,
wondering if anyone is going to Everybus from or
passing through Ohio. My brother lives there, wants to
attend and may need a ride. He's a Scirocco guy and
although its still a VW it's not quite the same as a
Carabus. Thanks for any help
Giles,
Anya 78 T2
