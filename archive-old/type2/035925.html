Subject: battery saga

Hello  Thnks for the replys.  I ran th eohm test by pulling each fuse and
watching the meter between the + and - connections.  No change ever so I
proceded to charge my battery and then return it to the retailer.  Her
conclusion was bad battery.  I knew I wasnt loosing my mind.  Thanks again.
 I hope I did that test right?
