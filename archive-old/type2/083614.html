Subject: Re: [T2] What is the toughest climb you ever drove?

OK Im a flatland woosie (sp?) and High Country is the worst Ive ever done
in a bus. Thats enough for me I just dont seem to have sea legs er...
mountain butt.
Why dont you all come down and well camp in the Keys and swim and eat
Florida Lobster tails....


&gt; I think I missed the beginning of this thread, but the most difficult climb
&gt; I ever did in my bus was up to the top of Grandfather Mtn at High Country
&gt; Bus Festival two years ago.  We were doing okay until the last curve and my
&gt; bus just cut out.  The engine stopped and I was holding the break down with
&gt; all I could.  It was pretty scarey to me.  I let her roll back onto a
&gt; flatter area and let her cool down.  Eventually we got to the top using
&gt; first gear and parked on the cliff and looked over.  It probably wasn't the
&gt; smartest place to try and drive a bus to, but now I know.
