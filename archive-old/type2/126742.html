&lt;&lt; Aren't we supposed to be running 38 degrees on Type 4? &gt;&gt;


Yes, that's the primary problem with using an .009 distributor in a type 4 
engine.  Unless you adjust the internal spring/weight assembly, you have to 
fudge the timing at either idle or full advance to get a sort of &quot;OK&quot; timing that 
won't hurt your perfomance and fuel economy too badly at either end.

The .050 distributor gets you a bit closer to the correct advance curve; 
several iterations of the dual advance distributors get you even closer yet to 
best possible performance.
