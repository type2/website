&gt; Every now and then, someone posts on the subject of towing a Type II.  I'm 
&gt; looking at a tow bar ~400 miles from here, wondering how to get it transported 
&gt; at reasonable cost.  FedX is quoting $85 and the seller would need to make a 
&gt; box for it.  Questions:

As other's have suggested. Greyhound. They don't WANT it in a box unless
it's something that can be easily damaged otherwise. They pack for space
and crates take up extra space. I've taken Greyhound trips and watch my
bags being stuffed in among uncrated steel fenders, bumpers, etc. And
they're generally quite reasonable. 

If it's an item is under 100 pounds and small emought to fit in one of
those HUGE cargo bays they'll take it. The towbar will probably have to be
wrapped in bubble wrap to protect other baggage from it's edges.
