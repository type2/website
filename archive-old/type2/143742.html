Subject: Re: [T2] Egg on my bus

I'm pretty sure that we all can agree on ONE thing:
Vandalism of VW Buses is NOT an appropriate form of political expression.

 THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
         that we
   UNANIMOUSLY CONDEMN
       said act of
   SENSELESS DEPRAVITY.

Whew!  That felt good.

Now, let's move on before someone says something that upsets someone else.  I
really don't like it when people start exchanging political rants on the
list.

Cheers,

Miles Erickson
