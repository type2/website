I just double-checked.

The only electrical connections that I removed were the AFM and 
throttle switch.  Both are now connected.

Checked again for leaks in the throttle boot by listening while my wife 
cranked the engine over.  Seems sealed up tight -- I can hear the flap 
in the AFM as the engine cranks over.

Went over the vacuum hoses again:

	- IAD connects to EGR valve, FPR, distributor retard,
	  and decel valve.

	- Throttle connects to distributor advance and air cleaner
	  charcoal can valve.

Hm... could a leaky oil breather gasket cause a starting problem?
