Subject: Engine rebuild. Engine case needed, possibly

I'm getting ready to rebuild my 2.0 FI engine for my 78 Westy.

The engine had very low compression in #1. I removed the heads and
found a burned valve on #1 and one that looks bad on #3. I'll get new
heads.

But what concerns me more is that the #2 main bearing saddle shows
some discoloration and the thrust surfaces on main bearing saddle on
the flywheel end are rounded and not sharp edged. A new .010 bearing
doesn't fit tight in there. The PO of this engine had it rebuilt many
miles ago.

Am I correct that it will need an align bore and .020 bearings?

Does anyone have a good case that they would part with for the right price?
