Subject: Re: [T2] oil filter removal tool

I ended up finding a multi-size plastic oil filter wrench that fits at
Wally World.  You use a 3/8&quot; std drive in it...  It's orange,
multi-sided, plastic, 2 pieces that nest together.  Works pretty good. 
Standard oil filter wrenches are a joke for us.  I've seen a slipon
metal one that's kinda just a tube in the manuals, too...

Teri
