Subject: Re: [T2] Going back to stock, more hardware required

Whew!

Jules, you are liable to get all sorts of opinions on this one, so here is 
mine.

You change your oil while the engine/oil is cold, right?

You fill it with the correct amount so that the dip stick shows full after 
the oil change....at this point, there should be *no* excess oil anywhere 
to drain back down anywhere.

So, how much oil is it using?  After sitting 3 years, I would expect you 
to use some oil the first few hundred or thousand miles, so might be best 
to wait on that.  You might want to try and use some Marvel Mystery oil in 
it for awhile on the first oil change.

A suitable new distributor(Single Diaphram Vacum Advance) should be 
available from www.aircooled_dot_net or from www.cip1....
We try to support John at aircooled since he was the &quot;originator&quot; of these 
when everyone else seemed to be on the 009 kick.

Someone else will have to pick one on the samba for your year as It's been 
a long time since I looked at one.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; now. I think the major source of my problems now are this darn 009
&gt; that i'm ready to get rid of in exchange for the stock distributor.
&gt; I've read the articles in the library regarding the 009 and 34Pict3,
&gt; and I've seen the disdain on the list for the 009.
&gt; 
&gt; So first off, where's the best place to pick up the stock distributor?
&gt; It's the 205 DVDA if I'm correct. Am I correct?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The problem is that my engine appears to be burning some oil, my
&gt; theory is that with the extra oil capacity, when the bus sits for a
&gt; while the extra oil in the cooler is flowing back down into my engine
&gt; and filling it with too much oil. Could this account for the burning
&gt; oil? Any possible solutions? I was thinking a one way valve could
&gt; prevent the oil from draining back but I'd like to hear of similar
&gt; experiences.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance
&gt; peace
