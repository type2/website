&gt; &gt;Well, it's now 4 months since they received the cores and no refund or
&gt; &gt;explanation.  I've called 3 times and each time they say they will look &gt;into
&gt; &gt;it and call me back...
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Needless to say, they haven't called back.  Has anyone else run into &gt;this
&gt; &gt;problem?
&gt; 
&gt; Indeed I also have had this problem.
&gt; MSHP still ows me $200. They never return phone calls and can never tell
&gt; you anything.
&gt; I am sure this is their business policy, no company can be that
&gt; incompetent, and it definitely increases their profits.
&gt; I am also not so thrilled by their technical capabilities. Both heads
&gt; they send me had flaws. One head I sent back on warranty and they never
&gt; refunded the shipping (another $15). This head had a bad spark plug
&gt; thread. Talk about no quality control.
&gt; I've given up on them and my money. Now everybody knows.

Martin:
It's good to know this.
Has anyone had positive(mail order) experience with anyone else?
I'd prefer my own heads back. Back in the 80's I dealt with Competition
Engineering, owned by Ray Litz. Very knowledgeable guy, good prices on
parts, good service, etc. Is he still around?(He was getting up in years
15 years ago!)
Any other good reports?
I've got an 80 vanagone that needs a top end rebuilt and was considering
MSHP but now I'll reconsider.
