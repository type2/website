Subject: Re: [T2] New dual carbs. Linkage binding.

Paul,

Just call John at aircooled and ask him...

John is a serious supporter of his products...personally, I would just 
grind it down just a little(item b below).

&quot;b&quot; is the least destructive of your choices...heavy springs will just 
make your accel cable work harder.

Cheers, dave

dual weber ICT's on my 1700. I got the kit from aircooled_dot_net. 
The hexbar linkage appears to be just a smidgeon too long. 
snipped

&gt;  
&gt; Should I: a: grind the bushings down a little on each bracket?
&gt; b: Grind the hex bar down, ever-so-slightly?
&gt; c: Remove the jam nut from one side of the linkage which would make it 1/8&quot; shorter?
&gt; d: Just replace the throttle springs with some that are really, really TIGHT?
&gt; e: Grind down each jam nut until they are even thinner than they were originally?
&gt;  
&gt; You can see the carbs near the bottom of page 10 at www_dot_cardomain_dot_com/id/deathead777
&gt; You can also see my nearly finished interior on page 9.
&gt; Thanks alot, list.                                             -Paul Deatherage
