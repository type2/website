Subject: [T2] Wow Were we lucky!

Yesterday morning, Jan &amp; I left in the refurbished single cab to see Clara's 
brother Barnaby in the city with a table resting on some blankets carefully 
wrapped with plastic in the truckbed. As we got on the freeway someone in a 
white mustang tried to undertake us on the onramp. He did a two complete 
rotations (a 720) and went in front of us and into the edge by the side of 
us. The road was a bit slippery but I guess that his silicon valley testerone 
pumped in and he used WOT. I just sorta slowed down and kept going straight, 
and we were not hit!
A few minutes later he shot past us on the freeway at great speed, so I guess 
that he is all right.
I do not know whether to be thankful that no one was hurt or to be mad at him 
and say he got his just deserts.
Anyway the 63 singlecab performed flawlessly and the first 100 mile trip was 
excellent. SO we will be at Kelley Park, hopefully with Robert Davis' slats 
installed.
I now have a properly working Digital camera, so the website of the renewed 
truck will soon be up to show the great work done by Clara and the painting 
by Tim.
