Subject: Re: [T2] Back brake stuck onto wheel

&gt; My rear right side brake (I presume the hand brake) seems to be stuck to
&gt; the wheel . I release the handbrake and the van won't budge. It was only
&gt; a few days since I was last driving it but had been raining a lot if
&gt; that has anything to do with it.

Mark
Its been raining in miami like 21 days straight and Ive been noticing my
rear brakes have grabbed on a couple times recently too.
Hopefully with a little back and forth throttle persuasion you can get
them to let loose.
good luck
