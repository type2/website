Subject: Re: [T2] Ticking bus still won't start.

Do check the ground strap at the front tranny mount as well as both ends of 
both battery cables, all clean and tight. Also, imperative that you verify 
the battery is fully charged, even a new one. Then disconnect the wire at 
the starter from the switch and have someone turn the key to start and 
verify the voltage. Should be same as battery less a fraction of a volt. 
Then hook the wire back up and see if you have at least 10 volts when the 
key is turned to start. You really need a better quality VOM to actually 
resolve starter/charging problems. There are no shortcuts to PROVE what's 
happening.

&gt;Acts like a dead battery.
&gt;When you turn the key to on the idiot lights come on dim. If I turn on the 
&gt;radio or CB or anything else they all get dimmer or just go out.
