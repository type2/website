&gt; Some of the artists for Veggie Tales must also be VW Folk. there was a
long segment in Jonah, where they were riding in a Bus. My kids made me
watch the movie just to see it.

Hey, I'd forgotten about that.  Good excuse to get another Veggie Tales DVD.
Love that down hill careening slide sequence...

And no, no kids under 16 here.  I watch the Veggies. :O)

(No trip to Chuckie Cheese's is complete without Larry singing a Silly Song
during the videos!)
