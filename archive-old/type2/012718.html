&gt;The big problem with that is that Outlook will only put 32767
&gt;items in a folder. Anybody figure out a way to turn the items
&gt;in the folder into regular files? You could put the files in
&gt;a directory and use grep to find what you want.
&gt;

If you're on a Mac you can simply use AppleScript to export your messages 
to a FM Pro database... Scripts are available here:

No clue what the windoze equiv. is...

Rumor has it that the admins are working on a more permanant solution 
anyway, so I'm not too sure this is worth the time it will take...
