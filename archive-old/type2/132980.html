Subject: Re: [T2] Painting wheels with POR

Jim,

Ok, I'll call yer bet&lt;grin&gt; and raise you 8 to 12 wheels.


From my *personal* experience with at least three vw's and one Ford SVT
of mine, here are my results.  All four cars have had the rotor's/drum's
painted with either por15 or black spray paint.  The bus absolutely
has the two drums and two rotors covered at the mating area with por15.

Admittedly, the rims were not painted on the mating area on the bus, 
except as they *came* painted in that area from the factory.  Think about 
that one....every steel painted wheel i ever had on a vw or other auto 
came with paint in that area....

Last time I took the Ford wheels off, they were at a higher torque than 
the 62 lbs I put them on with cause I used my clicker torque wrench to 
take them off the same way I put them on.

Vw's, no problems so far, but admittedly, the bus only has about 1,000
miles on it.  I have probably 25,000 miles on the other vw as i drove it
to work every day 60 mile round trip...with por15 painted drums and chrome 
wheels on a road advertised by the corvette club as one of the 10 best 
&quot;test&quot; roads in the country&lt;super grin&gt;.

Just my personal expierience....anyone else have any *real world* personal
experience with their wheels *ever* coming off...painted or not? because
of powder coat or painted mating surfaces?...in other words for any reason 
besides not tightening them down good to start with?...and I never put 
them on with an air wrench and I lubricate the lug nuts/bolts and the 
mating area on them with a thin film of grease before I put them on cause 
they always seem to have about twice as much torque on them when i try and get 
them off!

We are basing this whole discussion on one story and one failure blamed 
on the perceived powder coat/paint  issue and nothing else.

Cheers and happy friday, dave

&gt; &gt;From the Bench Racing file - I call Hog Wash on the &quot;painted/coated rims

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;...It is highly recommended that all paint be removed from the mounting
&gt; surfaces of the rim and hub. (Paint burns, blisters, and peels, allowing
&gt; the lug nuts to loosen.)...&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; I would posit that one of the premier off-road racing sanctioning bodies
&gt; knows a thing or two about how things get to loosen up - know what we
&gt; means, jelly-beans?  Personal experience dictates SEVERAL regular
&gt; re-torques of the fasteners on freshly prepped rims, which is what I
&gt; perceived as the problem with the Trashed Splittie epic.  The freshly
&gt; refinished rims were mounted up and the owners took off on a road trip
&gt; to attend some bus event and failed to recheck the torque.  End of
&gt; lesson some 400 miles later.
