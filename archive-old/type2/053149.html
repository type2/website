I do believe you're getting the hang of it.

I had a '66 Sun Dial many years ago, and I think (don't take this as gospel)
I found a plate somewhere that identified it as such.

Itch has a couple of plates (see http://home.earthlink_dot_net/~visket/Itch for
details) that identify it as 1) a California RV, and 2) a Westy.

I'm sure each conversion must have an identifying plate somewhere.

When in doubt, take a few pictures of the exterior and interior, upload them
somewhere, and post a message here with a link to your pics. I'll bet your a
dollar (mark / franc / pound / lira / shekel...) to a doughnut that someone
will identify it in 24 hours.

Also, take a look at the links on the (shameless plug) Bus Names page (end
shameless plug). You may find something that you have with what that owner
thinks he/she has.

&gt; Let me see if I've got this right.  VW just made transporter buses and ALL
&gt; the busses with camper gear (fold down seats, poptops, cabinets, power
&gt; outlets, fridge/stove/sinks, etc.) were transporters that were redone with
&gt; conversion kits?
