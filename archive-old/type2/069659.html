Paul,

In Maryland, you will fail with body perforations. I bought a pickem-up 
truck  once, with holes. Went to the FLAPS, got the typical bondo, and 
expoxied some windowscreen in behind the holes to serve as backing for 
the bondo. Did not have to sand or paint, just fill the holes.

I think your strategy is good though. In the DC area I always advertise
&quot;Maryland Inspected&quot;, and it definitely boosts consumer confidence.

Good luck,

Tom F.
