Subject: suggestions as to the essential things we would need

Hi Everyone,
   Recently Brian and Shannon asked for
            &quot;suggestions as to the essential things we would need
to take with us.  Not only for the bus but for ourselves as well.&quot;
  Well my years of hiking and busing have taught me to travel light, but on 
a trip like that I wouldn't be without Duct Tape.  It's amazing what you can 
do with that stuff when you have to.
