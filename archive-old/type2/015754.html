Subject: Re: Isolator vs. Relay
Mime-Version: 1.0


Hi all dual battery owners.

This thread comes up now and then so I figured I'll throw my 2 Finnish
Marks worth in it:-) I'll vote for the relay. With a few additions it works
just great. It's simple and cheap, a new relay can be bought almost
anywhere. Ask for a new isolator at the shade tree mechanics in Outback
creek and see what he says:-)

Some years ago I bought a 12Volt freezer box to have in my Kombi for the
weekend trips. Together with it came an &quot;cut out&quot; unit that shuts down the
power to the freezer when the voltage goes below 11,5 Volts. The devise is
meant to be inline with the power cord between the cigarette lighter outlet
and the freezer box. It's rated for max 5 Amperes and that's about what the
freezer box draws at maximum. 

Beeing an electrician I cold not leave the thing alone..... Today the unit
is connected to a relay after the extra battery. This way the cut out unit
cuts the power to everything  connected to the extra battery when the
voltage drops too far.Things like the freezer, stereo, inside lightning and
the 12/230 Volt inverter. The cut out unit only have operate the relay. 

The only problem is that after the cut out the battery regains it power and
the cut out unit pulls the relay back on after a while. Nice surprice in
the night if the stereo is left on:-) The good thing is that if only the
freezer box is left on it starts now and then and keeps the food cool
during the night. With a fresh battery the first cut out comes about 6-7
hours after the engine stop. The &quot;cut off and on&quot; process goes on for
another 5-6 hours. YOU CAN'T HAVE YOUR EBENSPRACHER IN THIS SYSTEM. It has
an after run fuction that cools the heater down, this doesn't work if the
power is gone. The heater should be connected before the cut out relay.
This sytem has worked well for a few years now and I never have to fear
draining the extra battery, no isolator voltage drop either.

Since I like relays there's another one in the system. That makes three of
them. This is a  relay between the isolator relay and the extra battery. It
cuts out the power while the starter cranks the engine. This is to avoid
draining the starter battery to the extra battery. The effect of that can
be discussed since the drained power is still &quot;in the bus&quot;. The reason I
use it is to protect the max 40 amperes rated isolator relay if the starter
battery for some reason is drained. If that happenes the starter tries to
pull hundreds of amperes trough the isolator relay. Jump starting from the
extra battery should allways be done by bypassing the isolator relay.

If someone needs a sheme I can draw one and attach it to a P-mail.
 See ya!
