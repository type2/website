Subject: RE: BUS / VANAGON Tires (Michelin)

	I've put the majority of my near half-million personal driving
miles on Michelin tires. Less than 10% driving a bus or vanagon I
admit, but from economy tires to performance tires I've had zero
problems with them. That said, an archive search is always in order,
but I'm really skeptical, particularly of wisdom coming from
a Che*vy truck list- :)
