Subject: 34-pict-3 Question

'K,

So I'm driving along, come up on traffic, push in the clutch and let off the gas, and
lo and behold, the engine dies.  I'm overdue for a tuneup, so I figger Tardis is just
reminding me.  She proceeds to stall whenever I take my foot off the gas.

However...

When I get home in the evening, I check her out and it turns out the wire to the
choke and fuel shutoff is disconnected!  Well now, this surprises me because I didn't 
think the engine would be able to run with the fuel shutoff valve not getting juice.

Question:

So now the question is, what does the fuel shutoff valve do?  I know it designed to
prevent diselling, but I thought it was supposed to prevent the car from running
altogether?!?!

Anyway, 

if someone can shed some light I would appreciate it.
