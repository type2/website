Subject: adhesive/ glue
Message-ID: &lt;c.397ff097.2ee08b92_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

I just bought a new emblem for the front of my 1971 Westy. I will use
the
snap on pins, but I also want to glue it on to make it a little harder
to
remove. To keep it from getting stolen again.
T temperature here only reaches 52 degrees F. Any recommendations as to
a
good adhesive.I`ve been told that if I glue it on, the thief will
probably pry
it off and damage the paint, but that is Okay because I will not buy
another
emblem, I will just have the Bus painted since it needs it anyway.
any advice will be helpful
