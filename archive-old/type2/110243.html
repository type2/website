&lt;&lt; Hi,

I have been off list for a while but I wanted to check in and find 
out if there are any known Internet bus buying scams that are popular 
at the moment. I also want to pass on some odd buyers I have 
encountered. &gt;&gt;

Thanks...But have you considered contacting the police...? While not
on the same scale of scam as Enron or Halliburton, they obviously 
are working the net for possible gain... ;-(
