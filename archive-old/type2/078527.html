&gt;Evening,
&gt;I  have another question I hope someone can answer. I have a 78 Westy
&gt;with a stock 2.0 and the threads for the temp
&gt;sensor on the head are buggered up. I can't get the sensor to sit flat.
&gt;What size is it so I can get a
&gt;tap and clean up the threads.

M10 x 1.0, extra fine 10mm, sort of hard to find but a good Ace hardware
and I mean good or machine supply place should have it.  In a pinch you
can &quot;make&quot; a tap to chase the threads or even cut new out of an old worn
out T4 valve adjusting screw.  Just grind/file 2 or 3 cutting edges into the
screw and grind the end to a bit of a taper.  I used one of these for some
time till I finally broke down and bought one.
