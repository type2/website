Here's an assessment of several years of ACVW parts buying and several days 
of trying to understand what part of &quot;10 working days&quot; is so difficult to 
understand.

1. If you want the best possible price on a common item or a &quot;from a dusty 
shelf in Germany&quot; rare item; you know exactly what you need; and you have 
planned well so you can wait 10 WORKING days, Order it from Bus Depot.

2. If you can't wait 10 WORKING days; are not quite sure what part you need 
or have other related questions;  pay a bit extra for expedited delivery, buy 
a phone card and still order from Bus Depot.

3. If 3 day delivery and an 800 help line are more important to you than the 
price of the part, order from any of the other equally reputable parts 
vendors, let the counter person hear you out and sell you whatever they think 
you need and damn the price!

4. If you need it tomorrow, go to the FLAPS, sigh heavily and hope that 
whatever the guy/gal with the chromed out, lowered honda out front orders for 
delivery by noon tomorrow is the correct part. 

Now isn't that simple if you think of it as 1-2-3-4?
