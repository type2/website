&gt; &gt;If ignition is retarded, temperatures go up.  However, if the

&gt; &gt;is no advantage to using high-octane fuel.  For example, my Mexican engine
&gt; &gt;wouldn't knock if I ran it on tequila!
&gt;
&gt; Our engines are designed to run on 87 but it seems that running an
&gt;aircooled engine at sea level and climbing the hills at altitude cause it
&gt;to run at vastly different termperatures compared to a modern watercooled
&gt;engine.

Not really surprising, since the airflow is constant.  If the engine is
making more power it is also making more heat.  To get rid of more heat at
constant airflow requires a greater difference in temperatures between the
heads and the air.  You're going to see a lot greater variation in
temperatures than you would with a watercooled engine.

In fact, a
well-designed watercooled engine should show _no_ variation in temperature
no matter how much power it is making.  Any variation indicates that
either the radiator is inadequate or the thermostat isn't controlling the
coolant flow correctly.


&gt; How this temperature increase compares to the pressure increase from
&gt;increased compression that requires higher octane would be interesting to
&gt;discover.

Theoretically, a high compression engine should actually run cooler than a
low compression engine, as long as it isn't pre-igniting.  The theory is
this:

High compression means higher chamber pressures, which means that more
work is done per power stroke.  The temperature within the chamber will be
a bit higher as well, but the improved efficiency of the engine (due to
the higher pressures) would mean that fewer power strokes would be needed
to supply the same amount of power.  The engine should therefore run a bit
cooler if the power output is the same.

That being said, it would be pretty tough to restrain oneself from using
all that delicious high compression power, which would run the
temperatures even higher than the low compression stock setup!


However, this leads me to another idea.  It used to be that you tuned your
engine to run on regular for economy, and to run on premium for power.
Back then, regular gas cost, say $1.00 a gallon and premium $1.20, a 20%
differential.

These days, here in SoCal, regular costs $3.13 and premium costs $3.33, a
differential of only 6.4% in cost.

That means that if a high compression engine that requires premium can get
more than 6.4% better mileage it is actually more economical to use the
high compression engine.

I wonder what the real difference in mileage would be.  I know that my
low-compression Mexican engine isn't the greatest thing for mileage,
although it is great for travel where the available fuel is of iffy
quality.
