&gt; &gt; So I am winding my window closed at the end of a drive.  It chatters a bit
&gt; &gt; (as it has been doing lately) and then the window falls into the door with
&gt; &gt; a &quot;thunk&quot;.  I take the panel off the door and have a look-see what is
&gt; &gt; going on.  Well, the metal clip at the bottom of the window and the tab
&gt; &gt; that connects that clip to the winder mechanism have parted welds.
&gt;
&gt; Hate to be the bearer of bad tidings, Steve, but you've got to replace the
&gt; entire regulator ( winder ) mechanism, the &quot;clip&quot;, as you put it, is welded
&gt; onto the rest of the winder mechanism, and therefore can't be replaced
&gt; separately ( you've also got to pull the quarter window frame out to replace
&gt; the winder mechanism.

well I have changed the winder without removing the vent window.  I used a
rotozip to cut a 2in X 3in or so hole just back of the crank, the location
will be obvious.   but it is a real PITA job....
