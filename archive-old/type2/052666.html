Subject: [T2] Re:Archives

I agree that the archives have been invaluable to us. But the reason they were so useful is that they combined so many peoples experiences. Until such time as there is a
new archive we still have an entire list of people with varying experiences willing to share knowledge.  I think that is Type2's greatest asset.
