I thought I'd make this a general post in case anyone else has had
similar problems.

Thanks everyone who contributed to solving my choke problem.  Following
David Lambdin's advice, I went out last night to look at the fast idle
operating rods (or whatever).  These aren't mentioned in either of the
manuals I have.  If you take the choke heater off you can see a cam
which is connected to the choke butterfly.  This engages with a pawl
when the butterfly is closed (or partially open).  The pawl operates a
connecting rod to the throttle lever.  The more the butterfly is closed,
the further out the pawl is held, the faster the idle.  With me so far?
The best way to see how this works is to open it up and see for
yourself.

Anyway, in my case both rods had been adjusted *way* off so as to have
no effect whatsoever.  I adjusted them so they looked about right (don't
ask me what the correct adjustment is, I have no idea).  At least I have
a fast idle setting now.

I also noticed that there is a step in the cam at the &quot;butterfly closed&quot;
position, so that the throttle is open a fair bit more when the engine
is first started.  I also now know why it is important to pump the gas
before starting.  This not only primes the carbs but also resets the
chokes.  You can then leave your foot off the pedal when turning the
key, safe in the knowledge that your butterflies will be closed and your
throttle will be partially open (thanks to the step in the cam).

Sorry if this is all common knowledge to most of you, it certainly
wasn't to me (or my PO) so hopefully it might help someone.
