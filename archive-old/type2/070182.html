Subject: Re: Tool storage locations

&gt;.._dot_deleted Ron's description of his tool storage in back of bus.
&gt;
&gt;I thought about that too, Ron, but opted for further up front due to fire
&gt;hazard. I tend to carry lots of tools, and though I probably couldn't save
&gt;the floorjack in the event of an uncontrollable fire, I'd have a good
&gt;chance at the main box, behind the passenger seat.

Oh man, and I even saw that PBS show on the Ki-Bird.  Hmmm...tools going up
in flames--well, good point!  But brother, if after all the work I put into
my '71 it decides to freak out on me and flame up, it can keep the tools
'cause I ain't putting any more sweat and love into a VW bus, nosir! ;)
Well, unless it's a nice splitty westy or a doublecab or...

&gt;I do check and maintain good fuel lines and connections, but the hazard
&gt;still exists. With the box, I can lug it around to wherever I need it (as
&gt;long as I've had my wheaties). 8) Joe

Maybe we could install ejection compartments so we could eject the tools at
the first sign of fire?  Or engine release thrusters to shoot that burning
magnesium clear of the chassis.  In any event, I don't think I'll be in the
frame of mind to worry about saving the tools--the rescue squad will
probably have to pull me out of the bus as I ramble out tune-up specs and
m-codes!
