&gt; Went to fill up the truck yesterday and checked the engine

&gt; just like I should... gas leak, the hose I did in a loop from the
&gt; steel fuel line to the intake of the fuel pump. Fabric outside of
&gt; hose was soaked and it was dripping gently on the tin. Drove home
&gt; and replaced it IMMEDIATELY with new piece of hose. I replaced all
&gt; my hoses less than 3 years ago. Check your bus regularly!
&gt; Time to go buy more hose and repeat the &amp;#_at_)$*# process.

If the line is bent in a tight loop, that might be a contributing
factor to the short line life.  Stressed rubber deteriorates more than
unstressed rubber.  I suspect that the stuff they are passing off as
&quot;gasoline&quot; in California these days also contributes to rubber
deterioration.  I do fuel lines every two years, just in case.

&gt; So, since a fully &quot;Hoverized&quot; case gets painted black, to reject
&gt; heat and stay cool, shouldn't those in search of heat from the stock 
&gt; set-up take their heat exchangers off, clean 'em up and paint them
&gt; WHITE? 

That would be the logical color, but I doubt that the increase of
convective heat transfer to the air flowing through would be noticable.
