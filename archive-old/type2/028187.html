I talked to a guy in Longmont Colorado that is in need of an auto tranny for 
his 81 Vanagon. Does anyone out there have one or could post to the Vanagon 
list? He has been looking for 6 months(I think he said) and here is the info 
he sent me. I ASSSUME a later model bay window bus tranny would work, but 
thats up to the VW gurus to say for sure. Can we get this guy back on the 
road in his VW ????

I need 1981 VW 2.0 L automatic tranny and am willing to pay a
reasonable
price + shipping to Colorado...
