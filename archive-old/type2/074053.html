Subject: Re: [T2] Re: heater box-exhaust header options

Bob:
Actually, the VW factory made some light duty heater boxes and put them on 411's. (Possibly 412's too, but I've never dissected one.) These were
the same fittings as the 72-74 type 2's, only they just don't have the aluminum radiators inside. Quite a bit smaller on the outside, too.
Apparently all 411's had Eberspaecher auxiliary heaters, so didn't rely too much on the engine heat. I saw some NOS ones on *bay a while back, but
around here we need heat!

&gt; &gt; You're talking about J-Tubes, here, I think.  I've seen them for Type I engines, but not for Type IV. They probably exist somewhere, though.
