Subject: solenoid problems??

hey pholks....
just came back from a show in effingham., and the bus did fine on the
way there, got a ton of compliments. i started it,
drove away from the show, and 5 miles down the road, i
stopped, got some food, went back out, turned the key,
NOTHING!  the head lights work, the radio works, the battery is fine.
the starter was replaced about a year ago.
it push-started, and took me 60 miles back home., but now it still won't
start. is it my solenoid? help!!
