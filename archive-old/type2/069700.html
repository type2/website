Subject: Injection Brain Information Needed...

Greetings all:
        I apologize if this is a little far removed from this lists normal
topic, but I need help.  Anybody have any experience with the Bosch inj.
control brains?  My question is this:  What does the three digit number in
the oval signify?  The reason for my question is that the brain for my '85
GTi engine went out, and I discovered this brain from an '85 4000 S.  The
Bosch part numbers are identical, as are the VW/AUDI part numbers, but the
three digits in the oval underneath the Bosch ensignia differ. 

Both boxes have the Bosch number of 0 280 8000 140, and VW/AUDI number of
 811 906 264 A.  The GTi box has the oval-number of 810, while the AUDI has
the oval-number of 078.

 Any ideas?  No one, including the area dealerships have a clue.  Should I
risk it and connect it and see what happens?  Any information would be
greatly appreciated.

TIA
