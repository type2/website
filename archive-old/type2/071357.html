Subject: HEAT! And Stupid PO Tricks
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

My '77 Westy has heat! And not just a little, but a lot! Finished up 
yesterday replacing the fuel lines, did the line from the tank to the filter, 
also put on a new fuel filter, which seems to have cured a 
stumbling/hesitation problem. In the MANY hours I've spent under the '77 
since I bought it, I was amazed at the condition of the heating system, 
everything is there and in good shape. Somebody at some point added a blower 
up front, and on today's 25 mile cruise I turned the blower on, and I got 
LOTS of heat, hot enough at the front vents to make it uncomfortable to hold 
my hand over the vent! Proof that the stock heating system DOES work! After 
my drive I came back home to scrub and sand the pop top. I've already done 
the luggage rack section, now I am  ready to do the rest (epoxy-based 
fiberglass paint, available at any boating supply store). Anyway, the old pop 
top seal was shot, and the stupid PO had used anything he could find to try 
and reseal it. It looks like a combo of Permatex (blue) and bathroom tub 
caulk. It did nothing to seal the top. It did, however, make one Hell of a 
mess for me to scrape off. Anyway, it ran great today, and I feel comfortable 
in taking it anywhere now. On to Everybus!       Jeff S.
