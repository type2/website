&gt; Okay, next question, anyone do this before?  Do you have to drag a full size
&gt; 12 v car battery around on a road trip in a 6 v car in case you might need to
&gt; run the timing light, or can a small/tiny 12 v battery of some kind do the
&gt; trick?

Have a 12V or 14V cordless tool of some sort?  The battery of one of those
should run a timing light for quite a while.
