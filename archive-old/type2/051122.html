Subject: [T2] eingine rebuild and compression ratio

Hello all, It's never easy.  I'm in the early stages of a 1800 rebuild, 
initially I was just going to do the top end but now I've decided to split 
the case and take a look at the bottom.  My goal is to make this a 2l FI.  
So, I talked to the machine shop and they said they could offset grind the 
crank to accept 2L rods.  Then I just happened to talk to an Older guy (age 
&gt;75), not that it matters, at work whom I never would have imagined knew 
anything about air-cooled vws but apparently he does used to drive them for 
years.  He told me that today's unleaded fuel is going to destroy my fresh 
rebuilt motor unless I have someone &quot;a professional&quot; build the motor and get 
the compression ratio decreased so that I can use today's fuel.  He was sort 
of discouraging me from doing the job my self, and didn't offer any info on 
lowering the compression ratio but told me to go figure it out.
So that's what I'm planning on doing but I need some direction.  First 
question how much truth is there in this gentleman's statements.  Second 
question does anyone have any good links to sources that will help me 
understand this.  I've read Tom Wilson's book but I didn't remember anything 
about decreasing compression ratio.  This guy only works on weekends so I've 
got this week to figure all this out and then I'm going to explain it to him 
and show him that I know what the hell is up.  If the stock set up is OK then 
that's great and please let me know but I still want to have a &quot;basic&quot; 
understanding of the calculations that go into engine building.  As always 
you feedback is greatly appreciated.
Marcus
