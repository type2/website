&gt; Every six months or so I ask this question. One day I might get
&gt; lucky. Here goes: I need the cooling boot for a 70 amp alt., to be fitted
into a ' 78
&gt; 2.0L Westy. This sucker is NLA and made of Unobtanium. I've been
&gt; sitting on a freshly rebuilt 70 amp. alt., (built to 90 amp by my local
&gt; electrical wiz) for a year now. Just need that freaking boot, or an idea
on how
&gt; to fab one myself. Anyone out there want to trade my first born, dog,
house
&gt; or wife for one?


If this is the part number I think it is, I don't believe it is
discontinued. I recall that we get them in in dribs and drabs from VW as we
need them for customers.  They were backordered for a while but not
discontinued.  Check with your dealer, for part # 021 903 655D and if that's
indeed the one you need, he should be able to get it for you for about $16.
