I though this was true, as well, until yesterday.  I own the CD, and went to
the website looking for some of my favorite pep-talks, that I've referred 
several
Listees to.  A few are there, but many are not.  I believe Bob added quite a
bit of material to the CD, that wasn't on the website, at that time.  The 
currently
available website appears to be identical to the early (Bob approved) website.

That leaves two ways for this invaluable information to reach the hungry lips
of ACVW aficionados--putting the CD back on the market (mine is worth every
last penny I paid for it!!), or the E-mailing of pertinent sections by 
those who have,
to those who need.

Perhaps a Petition, &quot;signed&quot; by interested/concerned Listees, beseeching Bob
to make this information available again?
