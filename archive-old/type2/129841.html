&gt;if you have new exhaust parts, or slightly used ones, ceramic coating is the

&gt;after 2+ years including some ontario winter driving (slap, slap, bad owner,
&gt;you shouldn't do that to your bus...) my ceramic coated heater boxes and
&gt;muffler are still rust free.

I've seen the silver ceramic coating discolor. How well do the blacks stand up?
