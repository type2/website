Subject: Re: [T2] AC

&lt;&lt;compressor, receiver/drier,&gt;&gt;


&lt;&lt; control valve.&gt;&gt;

What is a control valve in a Golf?

Do you mean the expansion valve?


&lt;&lt;When time came to fill the system it seems to take a very small amount
of freon (1/3 lb) until the pressure gauge reads 35psi (fully charged).
AC clutch kicks in, air blower blows, cold-warm air flap works but still
no cold air in the car.&gt;&gt;

First off--how long did you suck the system down, and waht reading did
you have on both sides?

Ah-Ha!
No gauges no vacuum pump--right?
It'll have a hell of time taking any freon without being evacuated
first---
this probabaly is it.
OR--if you did suck it down--
If the low side gauge you have with the Wally World fill-er up set up
reads high right away--the expansion valve is plugged--and this is why
you weren't getting any AC in the first place.
Pretty common problem in an older car where little particles of garbage
float around.
The capillary tube in the expansion valve is tiny--real small and if it
gets plugged up---No fredonia will be flowin' thu the system.

If you had a manifold with both gauges you'd see the high side going
nowhere.

&lt;&lt; I do not have a high pressure reading gauge (yet)&gt;&gt;

Get some--it'll tell you a bunch real fast.
Also grab a Happy Snappy Truck--they usually have a great book on basic
AC principles---good book to have.
It'll show you a lot and tell you a lot on AC systems.

Good Luck,
