DETROIT - VW AG, flush with the success of the new VW Beetle and the
payoff form its gamble on nostalgia, is working hard to come up with a
modern version of the 60’s era Microbus.  
	The automaker wants to accomplish with a new Microbus what it did
so successfully with the new beetle: warp the spirit of the original
vehicle In a thoroughly modern package.  “
	“We have been trying to create a vehicle that resembles the
Microbus as much as the New Beetle resembles the old one, because that
would make sense on the emotional side.” said Jens Neumann, VW AG board
member in charge of No American strategy.  “We have tried 3 times with
studies.”
	Unlike today’s minivans, which have the engine in the front, the
Microbus had a nearly flat nose and its engine in the rear.  This is a
barrier preventing VW from getting past the design stage.
	“The downside of all of these came out pretty clear  - safety
issues,” Neumann said in an interview at the N.A Auto Show.
	“If you have  a steep nose, then you run into these safety
issues. The safety regulations practically require to have some sort of
nose, whether it’s shaped this way or that way.”

NEW NOSE = NE NEWS
	Get rid of the original design, and “then the whole idea of the
Microbus is gone,” Neumann said.
Design studies for a new Microbus too closely resemble VW’s T5 - an
internal codename foe the next EuroVan, he said.
	But VW will continue to try, he said, and the reason is clear:
Nostalgia sells.  The automaker sold 84,434 New Beetles in the US in
1999, its 1st full yr. of production.,  Indeed, sales of the New Beetle
ran 2nd only to that of the Jetta sedan, which sold 130,054 units last
year.
	&quot;You can't turn around physics,” Neumann said. “And the looks,
this retro feeling together with some futuristic design, can only be done
if the nose is really flat .&quot; 
	VW produced 3 generations 

VW Maker may revive an old favorite con’t

of the Microbus, also known as the Type II, between 1950 and 1992.  In
its 3rd generation, it was called the Vanagon, but it remained true to
the original design.  Sales peaked at 66,069 in 1970.

NICHE CONTENDER
	Bob Kissick, who has a VW franchise at Boardwalk Auto Center in
Redwood City, CA, says a Microbus could become a popular niche vehicle.
Young families would be attracted to this product, he said.
	“Some of these parents probably remember being driven around In a
 Microbus as kids,: Kissick said.  “I can’t see this being as popular as
the New Beetle, but I think there is a definite market for it. It just
has to be different than anything on the market.”
	Kissick remembers selling the Microbus in the 5-; and 60’s/
	“It was well built, extremely agile, very inexpensive, noisy -
and there was nothing like it in town,” Kissick said
	It could carry up to 8 people. The Microbus was popular because
its unique look, its price and its versatility, said Jeff Wiliams,
general manager of Williams Auto World, a multi brand dealership in
Lansing, MI
	“VW really was the creator of the minivan with its Microbus.”
Williams said. “It was the hippie generation of the 60’s that really
boosted the popularity of the vehicle.”
