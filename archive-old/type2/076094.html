Subject: Clutch Cable Grease Suggestions?

Hi All,
I recently had to a first-time, emergency clutch cable replacement in my 79
bus and although I replaced the cable OK (w/ three manuals spread about), I
had to put it in with very little lubrication - I had none on board, and
all I was able to use was what grease was still on the old broken cable and
its clevis pin.  Since each manual I have (Muir, Bentley, Haynes) called
for the new cable to be lubricated liberally, I assume this is important
and plan to re-remove the new cable, grease it up and re-install it.  But,
I have no clue what kind of grease to use for this - can anyone suggest
what would be the best stuff to use for this application?  Thank you for
your help!
