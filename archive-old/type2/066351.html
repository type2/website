Subject: what are these?

While we are on the subject of parts (well, I was...) - does anyone know
what these are?
1) what appears to be a wiper motor, reads 111-955-113-12v. Bus or bug?
Years? I have two. presumably because one's shaft won't turn.
2) strange but neat little gas can, red stamped steel body; nozzle swings
back to transform into handle! Stamped &quot;ALLBOY&quot; and &quot;Made in Germany
Aust-PAT&quot; I assume this isn't VW, but it did come with my 65 singlecab. Any
info?
