Subject: Trade? '72 Westy AC pts for Htr

I have '72 Westfalia with AC unit under jump seat behind driver's.  I
plan to remove this unit and install a gas heater in it's place.  Black
plastic outlet vents come up behind driver's head.  There is also a coil
under the bus which I hope to remove.  The condition of these is not
known as the AC has not been hooked up since I have owned this
originally from Texas vehicle (+/- 13 years.) If these parts are of
interest to anyone, please let me know.  Compressor is missing.

Any tips re: the heater type or installation are welcome.  Currently
planning on a Stewart-Warner from JB's in CO.  He warrants his rebuilds
for 1 year.

I also need Westy cabinet handles.
