&gt; Daves,
&gt; 
&gt; Dave H. is talking about indexing the distributor drive pinion, not the cam
&gt; gear and crank. Wilson's book is not very clear on how to do this.


Actually I am talking about the cam/crank gears.  I have the distributor
drive lined up no problem, with the slot in the drive at 12 degrees to the
case as well.  The only thing that doesn't make sense in Wilson is the crank
to gear relationship (i.e. which way the dots are pointing when #1 is at
TDC).  Thanks for your input all, I will go ahead and join the case now.
Wish me luck!
