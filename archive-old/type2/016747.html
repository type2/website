&gt; armed with the Muir manual, I gave the bus its first (to my knowledge)
&gt; home-grown valve adjustment. I managed to completely ignore Muir's advice
&gt; in setting the distributor to the piston #1 firing notch, but instead, if
&gt; memory serves, left it on #3 (directly opposite the notch), with the
&gt; timing notch on the flywheel properly placed at 0 degrees on the little
&gt; timing strip. After that blunder, and noticing that the valves all around
&gt; seemed REALLY tight, I proceeded to set intake at .006&quot; and exhaust at
&gt; .008&quot;. It runs a lot louder now, but seems happy. 
&gt; valves on cylinders #1 and 3 be in the same position at TDC for #1?
&gt; Couldn't one feasibly open both valve covers, and reset valves on each
&gt; side in tandem rather than hand-cranking the engine all the way round
&gt; (i.e, #1 and #3 at #1 or #3 TDC, and then #s 2 and 4 in the same fashion)?
&gt; Or did I just totally screw up and set my valves super-loose?
&gt; 
&gt;         Thanks in advance,
&gt;         Ian
Ian:
Yes, you just totally screwed up. 
Indeed, you COULD just set cylinders 1 and 3, and cylinders 2 and 4
while the engine was in the same position, except that cylinder 3 has
its timimg event (and fires) 360 crankshaft degrees after that of
cylinder 1, which is half of a cycle (180 CAMSHAFT degrees) away from
the heel of the camshaft lobes (which is where you want to adjust for
clearance). As it is, you adjusted this number 1 cylinder for .006 and
.008 clearance when the valves are in the process of lifting and
returning closed, so they have about .020-.040 too much clearance on
that cylinder. It'll run there okay, but eventually all that hammering
will take its toll in damaged/worn valve train parts.
Actually, in addition to setting the engine to where the rotor is
pointing to #1 at the notch, make sure that #1 wire is really at that
position on the cap. A non-VW-savvy mechanic may have timed the engine
incorrectly.
