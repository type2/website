Subject: Re: master cylinder replacement report

Hey, just read your post. With the O'ring from the hardware, some rubbers
aren't compatible with brake fluid and will swell and go soft in it. Can't
remember which materials off hand, but keep it in mind. It would be a pain
to remove the MC for a dodgy o'ring.
With the heater bellows, if I'm thinking of the right part, aren't they
filled with cotton waste?? Should be safe.
