Hello Mike Shaw
I experimented the same problem twice this summer.  Our pumps on 1600 
engines are hard to prime.  If your gas tank is low, 1/3 for exemple, the 
pump wont be able to suck the air inside the fuel line.  two solutions. 
drain your line, bled it! or ad a 5 gallon of gas in the thank.  An engine 
will fire if you see fire and gas.  It may be running sqare but it will 
always start.


: list Just installed a new Brazilian engine in my '71 Westy. Won't start 
and we have traced the problem to a fuel problem. The fuel pump is a new 
Bucar (VW of Mexico). No fuel is getting to the pump. From the fuel pump 
intake line back is clear because we blew air into it and it went all the 
way back to the inline filter (which is full of gas) under the bus. 
Wondering if the pump rod is the problem. What is the problem????? Thanks,
