hi volks,
    the adventure continues, fun and all. It seems i do have a 215mm clutch,
yet there are still 2 choices from the dealer. Does this mean there are 2
different clutches or will both work?
     The choices are part numbers beginning with LUK then a bunch of numbers
(the same for each) followed by an F or an S
     Gonna go visit a mechanic on monday with diapragm and what's left of
the old pressure plate (all metal).

     havin' fun, gettin' greasy
