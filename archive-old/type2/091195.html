&gt; As a toyota driver I find that highly offensive:)
&gt; 
&gt; If you took the NEW Microbus parked it in a lot and asked
&gt; &gt; people what it was they would probally say Toyota. We know what it 
is only
&gt; &gt; because we have followed it from Concept.
-------LMAO!-------------

&gt; so whats next for the copy cats at the &quot;new&quot; VW? a retro Ghia?
----------ever compare the ghia to the audi t4? coincidence? i think
not... lol, just kidding. i think it looks as much like the ghia as the
new beetle looks like the original beetle.

&gt; Nope , Ghia is a trademark of the ford motor company.
--------WHAT???---------

&gt; I would love to have a EV doublecab or singlecab. 
---------this is a good point... even the vanagon had a &quot;truck&quot; version,
didnt it? i hadnt thought of that..
 
&gt; The fact that our busses are going on 30
&gt; years and older is what gives us that feeling, the fact that our busses
have
&gt; seen things that we can only imagine.They get more charater as they 
&gt; get older ,more personallity and fewer people will be able to remember 
&gt; when they were new adding a whole new mistique about them . 
--------excellent point... i think their age DOES have something to do
with their character, and it is sad to think of a day when no one can
tell younger people what it was like to own a brand new splitty, bay
window or even vanagon... *tear*

&gt; This is something the new bus doesnt have but eventually will have in
40 years.
--------unfortunately, i dont believe ANY car made today will be around
in 40 years. i hate to say it, but &quot;they just dont make 'em like they
used to!!!&quot;
 
&gt; When the new bus drivers wave and honk i will just wave back 
&gt; politely and go on my merry way , in my old bus.
--------why would they wave? new beetle owners dont wave, regardless of
the retro image they were going for. well, not in these neck of the
woods, anyway...
