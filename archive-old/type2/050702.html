Subject: [T2] Re: plans

Hi guy's,
Could the people who I sent the plans for the seat/sink unit etc (or those
who downloaded them), please send a thank you email to the guy who drew them
up. I think he's a bit peeved that his site www.spacecraft-uk_dot_com was not
mentioned. His email address is steveparry_at_spacecraft-uk_dot_com , great if you
can. We might get some more plans latter then!

Andrew Davies
