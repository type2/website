Subject: Re: [T2] Type IV Case Align Bore Question?

On Sun, 22 Dec 2002, Jeff Strickrott wrote:



&gt; I am in the process of rebuilding my Vanagon type IV 2.0L engine. I

&gt; time to align bore the case.


my understanding is that the alum cases of type IV engines should not be
align bored, but I am not an engine rebuilder so maybe some of the wiser
engine folks will say for sure
