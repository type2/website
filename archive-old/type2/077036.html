Subject: Re: [T2] oil psi

&gt;If the engine is a recent rebuild or a good engine it can 
&gt;produce 100 PSI with 20/50 Motor oil at 30 degrees.

!!That's too high!  I know what the weather is like in Texas and fully agree 
with the use of 20/50 oil for summer time use.  But you should really switch to 
something a little lighter for the winter.

&gt;My gauge is 6 BAR (approx 108 PSI) and it stays pegged out 
&gt;for the first ten minutes, them settles in at 55/65  PSI at 
&gt;highway speeds, 35/40 PSI normal city driving and 20-25 PSI 
&gt;at idle of 800/900 RPM.  The same engine can easily run at 
&gt;60-70 PSI at highway speeds, at 200/250 degrees temp. 

Ah.  Now I see what's up.  Your conversion for bar to psi is wrong.  One bar is 
approximately equal to 14.5 psi (not the 18 that you are using).  So your 6-bar 
gauge will measure up to about 87 psi.  What you think is 55-65 is probably 
more like 44-52 psi and your 35-40 is 28-32.  These are actually very good 
pressures and are not nearly as scary as what Stan stated.
