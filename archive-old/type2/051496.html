Subject: [T2] Bad news on heated blanket group purchase

Sorry I have not replied sooner about the group purchase, but my rep was
researching the part number........

It seems that RMMW has a problem with their vendor supplying the blankets in
a timely fashion, and thus are not carrying them anymore.

I guess that kills this thread unless another alternative pops up.:(
