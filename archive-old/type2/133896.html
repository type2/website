Subject: Re: [T2] Rear Wheel Not Turning

&gt;&gt;Maybe it's too far adjusted in and needs
to come out a bit to clear?&lt;&lt;

This makes sense to me. So the shoes might not be &quot;balanced&quot; so to
speak. With the screw all the way in, one end of the shoes sticks too
far out. Therefore, the drum contacts that end as the wheel turns.

I will move the adjuster screws out a little and see if this helps. 

Thank you.
