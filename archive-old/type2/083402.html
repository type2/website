&gt; I replaced my 150,000 mi cluch friction disk (was going on a long trip;

&gt; lining came off the rivets on the pressure plate side, worked itself
&gt; into the outside edges of the flywheel, and cause odd grabbing syptoms
&gt; when fully clutched and also some chattering in traffic.  Inability to
&gt; shift and a &quot;chirring&quot; noise required the pull- The pressure plate was

&gt; The original long milage disk was dry and still had a mm of lining- keep

Better to buy a new disk and keep it for a spare.  If you put the old one
back in it won't last all that long!
