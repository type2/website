I had almost forgot that those brand new spark plug wires were also from
JC whitney. Pulled the wire off the tractor and sure enough, bright blue
spark to the fan housing. 

none of the FLAPS around here have the wires in stock, so I ordered some
and they should be in by monday. Hopefully wire set #3 will work better
than coil #3 :-(
