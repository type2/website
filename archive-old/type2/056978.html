Subject: RE: thermostat missing/other alternatives?

Tom,

The thermostat pulls the air flaps CLOSED, not open. If all of your air
flow hardware is still in place, a spring pulls all air flaps open.
Reach behind your dog-house and near the base will be 4 little arms
sticking out that are all tied together with a metal bar. You should be
able to push against the spring's force and close/open your flaps. 

For your overheating problem check the following:

- Make sure your flaps are open.
- Check Ignition timing.
- Your engine compartment seal. If this is missing hot air is sucked
back into the engine compartment.
- All of your engine tin needs to be in place.
- Spark plug holes in engine tin needs have a good air seal.
- Check your oil cooler to make sure it is not clogged (externally, for
air).

Forget the thermostat for now.
