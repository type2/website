List people and Ron Salmon at Bus Depot

Ron, the new German heat exchangers arrived today. In words of one
syllable - WOW!
People, when was the last time any of us saw a brand spankin' new German
Heat Exchanger?That's what I thought. Well, I just received two brand
new ones courtesy of Ron. They arrived in perfect shape.

Ron, thanks again for a good deal. I'm tempted to get another pair. What
are the chances? Any left?
