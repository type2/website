Subject: Re: [T2] weird bay camper

Greg..

that was a &quot;home built&quot;   I knew the gentleman who originally built it....
( he is no longer alive)    he had built it using a 1979 pannel van, and
chopped the back off and built the back end using composite construction,
the rear half is suprisingly light, strong, and insulated...........    the
cabinetry in it, and most of the parts used in triming it were in fact VW,
or Westfalia............

Oh and he powered this thing with a 1600cc engine, and used to MAKE his own
mufflers.......

&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt; 
&gt; I saw a Westfalia camper similar to that one last year at BusFusion. It  
&gt; was based on a cube-van version of a baywindow.
&gt; 
&gt; There are pictures online here:

&gt; 
&gt; The windows, cabinetry and interior trim are just like what you'd find  
&gt; in a regular Westfalia.
&gt; 
&gt; Happy trails,
