Subject: Re: Electric Heater  Q's

&gt;A coworker has offered me an electric heater for my '66.

Using a 12V heater to heat any car is like hunting rhino with a pellet gun.
The device will operate, but you'll get frustrated because it won't provide
the service you expect, and then either you'll freeze or get gored to death.

A 12V battery can't provide enough current to make such a heater useful.  If
you're in a cold climate it's best to consider a gasoline heater.
