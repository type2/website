Subject: busses, environment, etc.

This whole environmental thread is right up my alley here and I have a 
few thoughts to share:

There are down sides to the ownership and use of a 26 year old vehicle, 
like emmisions, oil leaks (like that MAJOR oil leak! yikes!), etc.  BTW, 
a large percentage (I don't remember stats off the top of my head) of oil 
pollution comes from things like leaking cars, improper disposal, small 
things that commonfolk are responsible for.

BUT, the greatest thing about owning a bus is it is the perfect 
automotive example of reduce, reuse, recycle.  We are reducing the number 
of new cars being produced, which contributes to all kinds of &quot;bad&quot; 
things, environmental and not.  We are reusing old parts.  I got my doors 
and other assorted things off of another bus and I know I'm not the only 
one who gets parts from junkyards and parts busses.  In a sense, this is 
also recycling.  We aren't necessarily regenerating products from what 
would be waste, but we are taking what could have been waste to put 
together a really great vehicle.  

So even though I am a &quot;tree-hugger&quot; (see my homepage to verify that), I 
have few qualms about driving an emission producing, oil leaking bus.  
It's just a big recycling project.
