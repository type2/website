Subject: [T2] ADMIN: Quoting

This guide to quoting was written by Erik Meltzer.  It is accurate, well
thought-out, entertaining, and the administrators of this list agree with
it 100%.  Please read it and consider modifying your posts if necessary to
conform to this guide.  It will make reading the list and searching the
archives an even more pleasant experience than it is currently.

Quoting


Many an article has been written on the subject, so
here's mine.  The topic today is how to quote
effectively, or rather, how not to quote as ineffectively
as many on the List do.

The most frequent mistake is the &quot;text-above-fullquote&quot;
message.  That should be avoided.  It looks, roughly,
like this:

Arthur --
You ought to check the turlingdromes on the right
rear flutzpah, at least that's what was wrong with my
'74 last year.  About your last question, you don't
really need to with a '77, it's got autosassing.

HTH, Zaphod.

 &gt; Hi!
 &gt;
 &gt; I've been at Buses by the Bridge.  It was wonderful!
 &gt; Me and Fenchurch went in the '68, which performed
 &gt; flawlessly.  We met Trillian, Ford Prefect, and a
 &gt; couple other Listees whose names I've forgotten
 &gt; already.  Sorry Volks!
 &gt;
 &gt; I've a question about the flutzpahs of my '77 Westy.
 &gt; Lately they seem to be acting up; I can hear a
 &gt; subtle roar from the foobars whenever I try to
 &gt; sklark rapidly.  Also, I don't grok the concept
 &gt; of frooding -- what's the point?
 &gt;
 &gt; Keep on Bussing!
 &gt;
 &gt; Yours,
 &gt;    Arthur.

Note that on reading Zaphod's message, while undoubtedly
helpful, we have no idea what he's talking about.  We
need to scroll down to Arthur's message, wade through
that until we found the question, and maybe even refer
back to Zaphod's because by then we forgot the answer,
in order to grasp what's being suggested.

Now, let's have a look at the &quot;normal&quot; quoting style,
as widely (though, unfortunately, not universally) used
on Usenet:

It's much more readable, isn't it?  No need to scroll back
and forth, no need to re-read Arthur's depressing
signature, no need to wade through the now-useless
drivel about the Bus campout -- just read from top to
bottom.  Question, answer, question, answer, name, sig.
All there in the correct order, instead of answer,
answer, name, question, question, sig, sig like in
the first example.

It's even shorter by about 30%.  That means less online
time, less disk space, more content per digest -- all
sorts of good things.

But that's too much work to write, you say?  Well, on
a list like ours, the time one person spends writing
a well-formatted message, eight hundred persons
save reading it.  A win-win situation, because when
everyone does it, we'll *all* save time.  Yes, it
*is* a little more work, but it's not so hard after
all.  The most frequently uttered argument for not
doing it is, &quot;But my mail program quotes below,
and sets the cursor to the first line.&quot;  My point is,
that's perfect.  My mail program works the same way.
And even if yours puts the cursor on the bottom of
the quoted material -- you need to go up anyway in
order to write a text-above-fullquote message, don't
you?  So you have the same chance to do it right.

Here's how:

All you need to do is delete what you don't reply to,
and reply underneath what you didn't delete.  In the
above example, Zaphod would write &quot;Hi!&quot;, hit Return,
and, holding the Shift key, go down to the end of
Arthur's first paragraph with the Down Arrow key
(selecting it in the process), and hit Delete.  Then
he'd scroll to underneath the second paragraph, hit
Return, and write the reply to it.  Repeat the
process until all that's to say has been said, delete
the rest of quoted material, and sign.  Easy.
Piece of cake.


Too hard, too time-consuming?  In the above example,
it takes around 35 keystrokes more to do it right, not
counting the words &quot;About your last question,&quot; which
aren't needed in the second example.  35 keystrokes
are half of what's needed to write a sentence like this
one.  And it doesn't take much longer either -- once
you do it habitually, it'll be, well, a habit, and
will happen almost automatically.

Try it.
