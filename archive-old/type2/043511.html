Subject: Thanks To All

This was my 1st engine drop and I ran into a few snags and I really
appreciate the help from all involved. The pilot bearing incident, starter
malfunction, and noisy hyd. lifters almost had me in tears. and just got the
engine back in and everything seems to be fine. Filled up my gas tank for
the very first time ( thanks to my new filler elbow) and didn't spill a drop
on left turns. And ultimately, I fixed all my many leaks which was the
reason for the drop. Thanks again.
