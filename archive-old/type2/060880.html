Subject: Re: Parts Failure Survey and Speedo Question

Hi,

&gt;  I am anticipating a long trip with another '76 out in
&gt; the boonies and would like to have the known high failure parts on
&gt; hand.  Not that I would carry a spare mirror, but a good directional
&gt; switch would have been very handy when it broke, if you get the idea.


 Be proactive! Don't carry replacement parts- fit them!

Cheers,
             W.
