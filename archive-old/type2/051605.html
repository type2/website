Subject: [T2] Wheel Bearing question

Hello all,

I need to repack/install new back wheel bearings on my 1970 kombi. Now I 
have read thru the Bently and it shows that I need to remove the brakes and 
the backing plate and use this huge looking puller to pull off the 
housing.  My question is it possible to remove and replace the bearings 
without pulling off the housing?  From looking at the whole area it looks 
like it can be done but I am unsure

Thanks,
Mike
