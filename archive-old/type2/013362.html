To try and make a long story short.  My 73 Bus started having problems
shifting, particularly 1, 2 and reverse.  The shifter that came on the
bus was an aftermarket (JC Whitney?) that had been modififed some to
fit.  It's too tall for the hand brake anyway so replaced it with a
new stock shifter.  Shifting was alittle better but still hard for 1,
2 and now no reverse.  Replaced the shift coupler (it was really bad
but couldn't tell it right away) and now I am a happy shifter except
for one problem.  I grind 2nd gear when I down shift from 3rd.  Not
all the time but it's a fairly easy thing to do.  So my question is: 
Is my shifter not adjusted right?  Is this a common problem so that is
why people go with the aftermarket shifters that you have to pull up
on to get into reverse?  Is there another problem?  The coupler is
installed correctly with the set screw and little wire.  Had I gotten
this problem (shifting, not grinding) fixed last week I could have
made it to the Baker's Boat Bash, sorry John I was really looking
forward to it also.  

Again, any ideas, suggestions, recommendations would be appreciated. 

Kevin
