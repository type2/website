My younger brother is on year 20 with his turbot diesel Mercedes and he
swears by Mobil Synthetic. My hang up in using synthetics is that they
recommend longer oil change intervals and that is OK for the controlled
environment of water cooled engines but I'd always feel that 3000 miles
was maxing out my oil life and tipple my maintenance by not trusting the
oil.
I'm going to make the change soon (as a test) but I have been advised
that using it on a brand new engine (mine has 1200 miles on it) prolongs
the breakin period to almost indefinite. One list member said he had 8000
miles on his new engine and didn't feel that it had completely broken in
even at that mileage.
The price of synthetic oils would break me from buying by the case and I
always take enough spare oil. filters, oil screen kit and oil plug
washers to change or supplement my oil as necessary if a catastrophe
happens.
Definition catastrophe:
I blew the scraper ring on #4 cylinder at about 80MPH and the only thing
that saved the engine was that I saw all that oil deposited on my clean
back window just before the oil light came on so it actually never ran
with the zero oil pressure.
I drove the van 250 miles home by adding a quart of oil ever 30 miles or
so and it took a full case of oil and two head gaskets to get back home.
(you just don't know how embarrasing it was to be the crippled VW Van
slowing traffic).
I have since added oil temp and oil pressure gauges although I'm not sure
it would have helped in the situation I described above.

&gt; &gt; Here's a particularly interesting quote from that Redline site:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &quot;Synthetic Oil has 10% better heat transfer than Petrolium
&gt; &gt; based lubricants.&quot;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If you believe Redline, then this is a really good reason to
&gt; &gt; run synthetic
&gt; &gt; oil in a bus!
&gt; 
&gt; I have to say, that early this year, I switched from dino to 
&gt; synthetic
&gt; without any other changes and noticed a 10-15 degree drop in my oil 
&gt; temps
&gt; under the same driving conditions (weather stays the same here in CA 
&gt; for a
&gt; lot of the year, easy to do comparisons).  My oil temp went from 
&gt; 215-235
&gt; doing 65-70 on flat highway to 200-220, and I can now push hwy 17 
&gt; over the
&gt; Santa Cruz mountains at 50-55 without getting too hot.  Hurray for
&gt; synthetics.
