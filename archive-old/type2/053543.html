Subject: Re: Progressive Weber Kit

I found that my progressive carb kit had a spacer about a 1/4 inch thick on 
one side. I was told that these spacers are used on 914 engines but not on 
buses.  I also had to cut about a quarter on an inch off one of the intake 
pipes to make it fit properly.  If you need one of these spacers I can send 
you one.  Can't speak about how it works yet since I have some more work to 
do before hitting the road in the Bus.  Seams to run OK, I went with the 009 
dissy.
