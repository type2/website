Dunno, might have to disagree here - my '71 Westy was cheap to buy, is
cheap to maintain, and is more reliable than my '84 Japanese p/u was.
Return on investment? Well, I have a feeling that I will leave this bus
as worthless as I found it, but over the years I intend to drive it, I
think the operating cost ain't bad, and heck - for a mini-RV it's quite
a deal! And this for an admitted mechanical idiot.

Course, I haven't replaced the engine yet. Did that on a bug, though,
and it didn't break my bank. I just happen to think that aircooled
vee-dubs are still some of the best &lt;$1500 cars you can buy. Ugly, yes
(I mean cheap ones. I by no means mean that VWs are ugly!) but all in
all pretty reliable. And you can almost always *will* them to go a
little further, something my beat-up pickup did *not*.
