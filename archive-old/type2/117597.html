Subject: Re: [T2] VW Hippie Bashing (fwd)

John,

Keep suit on for a few moments yet...&lt;grin&gt;

I was there in the mid 60's and I *do* remember!
And I did have a 65 double cab and a 67 bus and a 72 bus.

Previous examples are the &quot;utopian&quot; movement and Henry David Thoreau.

What caused it was &quot;the war&quot;(vietnam that is) along with lots of other 
factors having to do with a nation growing up(or trying to anyway).

VW buses came to be associated with &quot;hippies&quot; cause they were cheap
used vehicles that you could live in, or haul tons of people to the
nearest concert with.  Cheap, cause you could use parts off of the tons of 
older vw's in the junkyards.  You could haul &quot;all&quot; of your musical 
equipment in them and still live in them after you got there...

They got fairly good mileage...think gas cost split X ways.

Once a few of them got started like that, all of us &quot;hippies&quot; went, 
&quot;this is the good life&quot;.  It is also awfully easy to &quot;disappear&quot; in an RV 
type vehicle if you don't want to be found for some reason or another.

&quot;It was the best of times, it was the worst of times&quot;

My last comment on this thread before the &quot;admin&quot; kills it!

Cheers, dave

&gt; &gt; I'm curious why all these past tense terms are being associated with this
&gt; &gt; culture?  Seems to me &quot;Hippie culture&quot; was around long before the 1960's,
&gt; is
&gt; &gt; still alive and well, will no doubt be around for some time to come!

&gt; 
&gt; No, nothing like it before or since. (Asbestos suit on).
