&gt; that was disconnected. I am reconnecting the blower fan (all the wires
&gt; were cut and removed). I have one final wire to find:
&gt;
&gt; If you scan along the bottom of the diagram for earth/ground
&gt; connection 68 this is for the blower fan. Now scan upwards and you
&gt; will see two live 12v feeds on the other side of the J14 relay.
&gt;
&gt; 1) Why are there two 12v feeds,  one from the coil (N) and one from
&gt; the alternator (D)?

actually it is one from the alternator then to the coil...

&gt; 2) Which should I use?

you need both

good luck
Bob
