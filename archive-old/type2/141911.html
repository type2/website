Subject: Is my engine supposed to idle down over a period of about 15
  seconds?

I notice that when I come to a stoplight, my engine will be idling at about 1200rpm and slowly idle down to 950 over a period of 10-15 seconds. Is there a deceleration valve on this engine or something? It's a box stock 77 westy 2.0L engine. I don't recall my other engines doing this.
