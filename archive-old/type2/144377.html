Subject: Re: [T2] Pressure Relief Valve 74 Westy

John,

Thanks for the info.  Knowing that, I need to take care of the spinning 
nut dilemma.  If the valve is inside, and the nut is spinning, how 
would I go about fixing this?  I can't seem to pull it out or tighten it. 
Also, how is there a trick to  accessing the valve? Then once it's out I guess I 
need to check the valve, retap the hole (?), and reinstall it.

Hi Matt,

You need to distinguish between the pressure valve and the cap. You
can replace the cap with a temp sender, but the valve is deep inside
above the spring. The valve is crucial to your motor.
