&gt;Saturday night I left a party with my van running fine. Half way home the

&gt;simptoms like the cable being stuck? I will check that and the pedal again.
&gt; Then I will check the idle adjustment screw.  Possible vacum leak in the

&gt;down shifted you could really here the difference in the engine. This time
&gt;that is not occurring so I think i have a different problem.  Maybe the
&gt;auxillary air regulator? Any help or past experience will be greatly

If the weather is cold enough, and the electric choke is disconnected or
goes belly-up, you can get this.
