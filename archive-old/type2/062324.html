&gt;VanBondo wakes up from withdrawl symptoms and replies to Tim 
&gt;Smith:
&gt;That was cold you Turkey! ;-)
&gt;
&gt;Now that I am &quot;restricted&quot; to only one account I might have to 
&gt;cut back to responding to every other message to the list(s)~!
&gt;
&gt;Like you said,
&gt;&quot;Um, like I'm a netaholic and Um, like my name is like uh, 
&gt;Rusty?...&quot; &lt;insert appropriate Beavis or Butthead/Letterman 
&gt;voice&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Everyone yawns from lack of sleep due to sitting in front of the 
&gt;CRT all night doing the mIRC thing at #vw and searching Netscape 
&gt;for just one more vw related url.  With their crippled carpal 
&gt;tunnel ridden hands and frozen right shoulders they sit down 
&gt;their cup of double expresso paw at the ergonomic keyboard that 
&gt;the doctor prescribed for them. Over then next half hour they 
&gt;manage like Christopher Reeves doing the Macarania are able to 
&gt;type in &quot;Hi Rusty!&quot;

&gt;BTW:I am under a killer deadline this AM so I wont have time to chit-chat
today!
