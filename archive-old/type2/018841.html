Thanks to everyone who replied and gave suggestions.  Did compression test
yesterday.  Start w/#3 of course.  Hey, it's 115 lb!  Check #4.  It's 120 !!
Dropped #4 sparkplug into the engine tin again, durnit!  MANY thanks also to
whoever suggested the little supermagnet-on-a-pen thing to retrieve spark
plugs.  Check #1.  Zero.  Gulp.  Check #1 again.  Zero.  Oops.

I get to pull a 300 lb engine and do my first-ever valve job.  Luckily I
have the luxury of doing it at my leisure, since Maureen isn't my daily
driver.  And I'll get to clean up her engine proper and fix that pushrod oil
leak.
