Subject: Re: [T2] i got stopped by someone from sirius radio while
  driving my bus

I'm a prop guy and use vintage vehicles fairly often in shooting  
commercials and films. We just used a '56 Metropolitan for a movie  
shot in Spokane, WA.

Rental rates vary, but don't sell yourself short, especially if it is  
a flat fee with no fuel/mileage reimbursement.
minimum day rate on a vintage vehicle should be no less than $350. If  
the vehicle actually drives in the shot then it needs to be more like  
$400-500.
Of course it also is dependent on how many days they use your  
vehicle. You migt negotiate a lower day rate in exchange for an  
increased number of days.

Also be sure to clarify whether you are going to be the driver. We  
had to have actors drive the Metro in this movie and they burned out  
the clutch.
The production company should have a teamster or transpo person to do  
any driving of the vehicle that is &quot;off-camera.&quot; If not, ask that you  
be paid to be on set to drive it into position for the next set up/shot.

Oh and a biggie is to do a walk around with a production company rep  
before they shoot so you both see an notate what dings &amp; dents are  
there prior to shooting. Accidents do happen, but make sure the  
company reimburses for any damage, however minor.

You gotta keep production companies honest. They got the money, but  
try to pinch every penny they can:)
