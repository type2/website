Subject: oil pump

I putting my engine back together now, I took off the oil pump to check for 
wear and found there was a gasket on it.
It is in BAD condition and I cant reuse it, very old.
Could someone tell me if I could install the pump without a
gasket, just using sealant.
I can't find anyone that just sells the gasket, and
I don't fell like ordering a entire gasket set. $60 bucks
and another week for shipping time.

I asked this question a few days back and no one answered :(
Comments, suggestions good or bad _please_

By the way its a type 4 engine,2000cc
Thanks;
Alex Wisniewski
