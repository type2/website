My orange (and white (ish)) is called Polly (put the kettle on) - kids
again.
If this doesn't translate too well on its way across the Atlantic, please
feel free to ask for an explanation.

BTW - sorry to be serious on Friday, but is it possible for anyone anywhere
in the world to buy NEW Brazilian bus parts - like fuel filler necks of
tanks or whatever?
