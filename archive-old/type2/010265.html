&gt; Hey Volks,
&gt; 	It took five guys to help me carry my type IV 1800 into the

I rebuilt my motor in the basement too (nice in the winter with the wood
stove) - a more safe way to move the type IV is to tie it to a pallet. 
In  a friend's garage I    used a chainfall to hoist it in the air then
set it on my trailer all by myself.  After backing the trailer near the
bulkhead I slid the motor on the pallet down doubled 2 x 4's ramp.  I
tied a rope from the pallet to the front of my h*onda C*ivic and eased it
down as the wife guided me.  Once down cellar I used PVC pipes as
rollers.  (did use some help to get on the engine stand).  Put a
woodstove down my cellar by myself also using the H*onda!
