&gt; older story about my 1960 23window deluxe.
&gt; 
&gt; I was a scout leader at the time and our troop was at the annual Camporee
&gt; and we were having a good old time, When late Sat afternoon we suddenly
&gt; get hit with a tornado.  (yes one boy was killed) most of the scouts did
&gt; the right thing and formed up on a nearby beach.....
&gt; 
&gt;    Since the campsites were destroyed and everything bar none was soaked
&gt; the kids were loaded into cars, parents were called etc.  but no scout was
&gt; allowed back into the campsite.
&gt; 
&gt;   I stayed behind to guard and help clear the campsite up, also I was the
&gt; only one left who was medic trained...My van was parked between two other
&gt; larger vans (fords I think) in any case a tree crashed down and clobbered
&gt; both other vans, mine was untouched and just needed a little brush
&gt; clearing and driving it into the clear.
&gt; 
&gt;   In anycase the next day the leaders who remained went in to recover as
&gt; much gear as possible.   drove my bus into the site after some trees were
&gt; removed.   looked around at the destruction and tried to figure out what
&gt; to do next????
&gt; 
&gt;    I opened the sunroof on the van and started throwing gear into the van
&gt; over the top.   when finished I lashed my canoe onto the roof and drove
&gt; back to the church.  I arrived with all of the gear and tents for 23 boys
&gt; and  3 other leaders, and my stuff all in this one van.  water (everything
&gt; was soaked) was dripping out of the side door and I was down on the shock
&gt; stops, probably could get it up to 35-40mph.  well the kids were waiting
&gt; and one runs up to the bus and opens the side door, and gets hit by a
&gt; tidal wave of water that had drained from all of the wet stuff!  
&gt; 
&gt;   That probably was the heaviest I ever packed any of my vans, soaking wet
&gt; gear was up to the sky windows.  It was also one of the saddest uses of my
&gt; van, three days later we used it to haul a half dozen of my scouts down to
&gt; the funeral of the scout that was killed....his scoutmaster was a friend
&gt; of mine and he was totally destroyed, never was the same after that
&gt; 
&gt; in any case, just thought I would share a &quot;survivor&quot; tail in which the VW
&gt; bus played a major role.  more than utilitarian that was for sure
&gt; 
&gt; this happened over 20 years ago and it is still one of those &quot;moments&quot; in
&gt; history in my life.
