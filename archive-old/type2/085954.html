I had similar intermittent problems. The tip off was with the lights on I 
could measure a small voltage between the negative battery strap terminal 
(at the battery) and the chassis ground. The voltage would vary as I 
manipulated the strap.
I finally pulled the woven strand battery to ground strap. I measured the 
resistance as I twisted it and noted a changes in reading. It seems in 
certain positions only a few strands were conducting. Maybe some would fuse 
under an increased (lights or starter)load and cause problems. I installed a 
big fat Napa strap and have had no further problems.

The tip off was, with the lights on, I could measure a small voltage between 
the negative battery terminal and the chassis ground. The voltage would vary 
as I manipulated the strap.

I will suddenly lose all power to the motor,
&gt; &gt; lights, radio - everything!

If you lose all (I mean all) power and it comes back on later and acts 
normal it is the battery cables or terminals opening. Nothing else will 
cause this condition.

A positive battery cable short would cause insulation to melt. Opens do no 
such damage.

A total open (many ohms)shuts every thing down if the open is in either 
positive or ground cables. A few ohms causes relays not to work and other 
strange symptoms.

&gt;
&gt;Just a guess, but I would check the dimmer relay. The headlight switch 
&gt;sends
&gt;power runs through the dimmer relay en route to the high and low beams.
&gt;Turning the lights off and on may jolt a failing dimmer relay unshorting it
&gt;for a while.
&gt;
&gt;Cheers,

&gt; &gt; Hi all,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My 68 Bus has been having the worst electrical problems. Right now after
&gt; &gt; driving for a few minutes I will suddenly lose all power to the motor,
&gt; &gt; lights, radio - everything! It became the most noticeable in the past 
&gt;few
&gt; &gt; weeks when I would turn on the directional and the indicator lights 
&gt;would
&gt; &gt; not come on and sometimes I would also get the dim generator light but
&gt;this
&gt; &gt; would only last for less than a minute then all would be fine again. 
&gt;More
&gt; &gt; recently I would get this same problem but now I would have to shock(?)
&gt;the
&gt; &gt; power back on again by turning the headlights on which simultaniously
&gt; &gt; results in a quick loss of power to the engine (would almost stall it 
&gt;out)
&gt; &gt; but then this (headlight flashing action) gives me my power back again.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Right now when I go to start the car it will usually start but then it
&gt;will
&gt; &gt; suddenly lose power and stall as if the battery is dead (very very dim
&gt;dash
&gt; &gt; lights). When this happens I can eventually get it started by just 
&gt;playing
&gt; &gt; with the headlight and or ignition switch a few times when it will just
&gt; &gt; suddenly come back to life as if there was no problem. If this happens
&gt;while
&gt; &gt; I'm driving I can get the power back by using my light switch shocking
&gt; &gt; method. When I get the this problem while I'm still in the driveway I 
&gt;jump
&gt; &gt; out and start wiggling all the battery connections and starter wiring
&gt; &gt; connections (which all seem very solid and clean) but this never fixes 
&gt;the
&gt; &gt; problem like fidling with the light or ignition switch does which leads 
&gt;me
&gt; &gt; to believe their is a wiring problem somewhere else. I have even 
&gt;removed,
&gt; &gt; cleaned and replaced the large red wires connections going to the light
&gt; &gt; switch and fuse box and still no change in this problem.
&gt; &gt;  Over the last year I have replaced the battery, starter (bad solenoid),
&gt;the
&gt; &gt; positive battery cable connector, and since this problem has been 
&gt;showing
&gt;up
&gt; &gt; I recently upgraded to a new Bosch (internal regulator) alternator 
&gt;(which
&gt; &gt; did not fix the problem or change it in any other way).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Please help I am completely losing my mind over this.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Brett
