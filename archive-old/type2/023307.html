Subject: Re: [T2] lowering a bay-window bus

Better start searching the archives. The answer is there because we beat 
that dead horse regularly.

Back: adjustable trailing arms, adjust torsion bar settings. Saw lowering 
bracket for adding drop between trailing arm and torsion bar arm. Dunno if 
these are safe or where to buy one.

Front: adjustable beam, no such as dropped spindles YET.

Porsche Wheels: restud the hubs --- but the front hub is too small for the 
pattern really.

Adaptors are possible and available BUT most are for show vehicles, not 
safe (strong enough) and many folks mention lug nuts spontaneous loosening. 
Also contributes to unsprung weight. The 'good ones' I found were VERY 
expensive - almost $100 a wheel. Still the manufacturer warned they were 
for light duty use - which led me to wonder what the heck was light duty on 
a regular road going vehicle - avoid the pot holes or your wheel comes off? 
&lt;grin&gt;

Check Mercedes wheels - some have the right offset, and all are the right 
pattern.

&gt;
&gt;That being said...
&gt;
&gt;What methods do the custom bay drivers use for lowering their busses? I'm 
&gt;guessing adjustable front beams in the front.
&gt;
&gt;What about the rear?
&gt;
&gt;And while I'm asking, what about getting the Porsche wheel bolt pattern. 
&gt;Is there a way to do it without using spacers?
