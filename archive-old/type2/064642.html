Subject: stiff brakes

Then one time I called on a professional to do work on my car had to do with
weird brakes.  I needed the car to work with and I couldn't solve the problem
myself so I paid someone (way too much) to do it for me.  The symptoms were that
the brakes would pump up and lock.  The answer had to do with adjustment of the
stroke on the piston on the master cylinder, But I never could get it right.
The mechanic who took the car in called the problem &quot;hard pedal&quot;.  Sounds like
your problem might fall in this category...John Jensen In Annapolis
