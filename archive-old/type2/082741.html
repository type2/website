Subject: Front axle beam - inserting unwelded leaves

As Bob says, this was more fun (NOT!) than should be legal.  What finally
worked:

The set looks like this -
                      Leaf names (for shorthand)
       _____            small
     _________          outer middle
     _________          inner middle
   _____________        outer central
   _____________        inner central
   _____________
     _________
     _________
       _____

What I wound up doing was inserting the two outer central leaves, then the
inner central leaf between them.  Then the outer middle leaf then the
inner middle leaf behind it.  Last, the small leaf.  The three central
leaves have very definite orientations because the set screw indentations
are in them.  The small and middle leaves do not, but I did my best to
preserve their orientation, because reversing the direction of twist on a
20+ year old torsion member is probably not a good idea :-)
