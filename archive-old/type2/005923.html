There has been some posts concerning timing notches and which notch is
0dTDC.  My 1600 upright had a few of these notches and the way to figure out
which is 0 degrees TDC is to get your engine at 0 degrees TDC either by
sticking a pencil in #1 spark plug hole and rotating engine until pencil is
highest or by observing when your distributor rotor is pointing to the #1
spark plug wire and then looking at your pulley and see which notch is lined
up with the crank case split.  Hope this helps someone!
