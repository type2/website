Subject: Steering Freeplay - How to Fix?

Hi Folks,

I've noticed that my Bus has more steering freeplay than it had before, and 
I was wondering about a good course of action for fixing it.  I checked the 
archives, and there was mention of replacing the drag link and mention of 
adjusting the steering box.  I was intrigued by the steering box adjustment 
-- is there something easy that can be looked at to tighten the box itself, 
or does the box require replacement?

If my understanding of the system is correct, I can see the tie rod ends, 
the drag link, and the pitman arm bushings as all being places for potential 
wear.  Is there more to it, or is this it?

Thanks in advance for any help or suggestions.
