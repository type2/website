&gt; I have it on good authority that Bill Gates hast spoke to Robert Bentley...No
&gt; CD's for you, MacApostate.

Yeah, yeah, yeah...someone else reported that it's cross platform. (If it is
PDF, it's not only PC-Mac cross-platform, it could be considered &quot;pan-
platform.&quot; Adobe has Acrobat PDF readers for Linux, SGI, Sun...you name it,
if it's got a graphic interface there's an Acrobat Reader for it.)

Edelstein update: Floor restoration continues apace, though not at a rapid
rate; I had to work all weekend (how else do we get Bus money?) and tomorrow
I've got to change a clutch cable in my Bug. I got an impact driver last
weekend; went crazy impact-undriving things and now am down to the hinges
that hold the engine compartment door on. It's hard to use those things on
that set of screws; very little room to swing a hammer.
