&gt; I follow your method with two switches, and correct me if I'm wrong,
but don't you mean DPST to get away with one switch? How would you not
'crossfeed' the batteries with SPST? Wouldnt' both the battery leads be
on one side of the switch and the connection to the meter on the other
for basic on/off operation this way? You would get an average of the two
&gt;voltages (parallel ckt).

Hmmm, have to think about that a bit.  What I should have said was &quot;SPDT&quot;
not &quot;SPST&quot;.  You want a switch that will connect your voltmeter to either
of two wires.  The voltmeter connects to the center terminal of the
switch, while each battery wire connects to one of the end terminals
