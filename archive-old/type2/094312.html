Subject: Motor changes for the bus 

That's right I forgot the 356 and 912 had the 4 cylinder motors . It's not
easy keeping up with all that . I don't really want speed , I was just
curious if anyone had done it . I used to be a Mustang man , so I had my
days of speed and lived to tell about it . I'm certainly not a GM man ,
after 13 years working on cars I would never have anything GM . The Corvair
is an interesting car , it's good to look at only - for me anyway . The one
thing that does concern me about the van is how fragile they are at highway
speeds , how people look at you because you simply can't maintain the speeds
that everyone else is going . I understand that my 1979 has 70hp and weighs
5200 lbs , just imagine the earlier ones with even less power . When I do
rebuild this one , I want to do some upgrades that will reduce the
temperature of the motor for safer highway travel .
