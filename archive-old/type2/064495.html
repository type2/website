Subject: Re: gas tank panel removal _at_#$%??

&gt;   cleaner stuff, the left hand side carburetor, and managed to get the
&gt;   panel to move
&gt;   freely but not drop down or come out.

&gt;   tin. If anybody
&gt;   can understand what I am taking about, advise would be appreciated.

I'm not sure I do, but I should point out that there are 2 screws holding
the firewall from beneath the chassis. They are not mentioned in Bentley
and it took me a while to figure out why the darn thing wouldn't come out.
So slide under the bus with a flashlight and take a look. Maybe that was
your problem?
