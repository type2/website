Subject: Compression Ratios

Dear buses,

Since I'm not supposed to attach a simple spreadsheet, I would like to
offer the approximate equivalent.  Certainly this is elementary for most,
but with people saying they have 7.0:1 with a stock engine, or 6.7:1 with a
69x88 and Berg heads I thought I'd post it.

bore(mm) x bore(mm) x stroke(mm) x .0031416 = total CC
85.5 x 85.5 x 69 x .0031416 = 1584.65 CC

Head CC = 	~50cc stock (&gt;48cc, &lt;52cc)
		52cc stepped head (sometimes called a &quot;smog&quot; head, used in type-3 FI)
		57cc Gene Berg Semi-Hemi 85.5
		59.8cc Gene Berg Ported &amp; Polished Semi-Hemi 90.5

bore x bore x deck x .01996 = Deck CC
85.5mm x 85.5mm x .067&quot; x .01996 = 9.78 CC (Stock Deck CC for most cases) 

bore x bore x shim x .01996 = Shim CC  (IF USED)

85.5 x 85.5 x .04&quot; x .01996 = 5.84 CC

One cylinders swept volume = 1584.65/4 = 396.16 CC

Head CC + Deck CC + Shim CC = Trapped head volume CC
57 + 9.78 + 0 = 66.78 CC  (NO SHIM, BERG HEAD)

396.16 + 66.78 = 462.94 Total volume

So the ratio is Total volume over Trapped volume;

462.94/66.78 = 6.93 CR 

My favorite stock CR, runs on regular 87 octane fuel, 13 deg BTDC static/w
009, 140 mains, plenty of power, runs cool, average 19.7 mpg over the life
of the engine.

Thus a stock engine with Berg heads is closer to 6.9:1 than 7:1.
and a stock engine with stock heads is closer to 7.6:1 than 7.3:1 which is
what the manual says it is.  

Case deck heights do vary and the VW factory changed the compression year
by year with the case DECK height so yours may be different, but most cases
new are about .065&quot;-.067&quot; when measured with the pistons and cylinders
installed.

Head CC can also vary rather widely from stock depending on the whether
they were cut or something in which case they could be way under 48cc.

Stick this all in a spreadsheet with a couple scenarios and you get a
better idea of whats really going on.  Jack up the bore or stroke and
things get crazy.  I don't use a deck height tool or a head cc tool because
I think I get the basic idea with a straight edge, a depth gauge, and a
guess, but I've always wanted them.

An 88mm bore slams a stock head up to 7.95:1 (can you hear it ping?, try
160 mains, 3-5 deg BTDC static timing, better have super cold plugs) and a
Berg head up to 7.23:1 (still needs high octane fuel, can barely hold 7.5
deg BTDC static timing without pinging).


Hope this helps, 

Sincerely,
Eug, expounding on the older 1600cc engines, doesn't know much about the
type 4, but suspects they're alot alike.
