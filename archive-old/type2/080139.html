&lt;&lt; But wouldn't the tire and wheel also serve to spread the impact over a

greater area and therefore provide a greater amount of structure to absorb

said impact? I thought that would be a good thing.

PS: I didn't take physics.

Only if it was filled with an an energy absorbant material (sand would be 
fine)
mounted on a frame to spread the impact across the nose, rather than 
through it which is why the &quot;flimsy&quot; modern plastic energy absorbant bump-
ers are better for the occupants of cars than older and heavier metal ones.
