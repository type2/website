Subject: Re: [T2] Praise for Bus Depot (Longish)

     Well, I personally think that we have a certain responsibility to 
defend people that are unjustly bashed for things that simply are not the 
case.  Ron does allot for this list, and I feel that more people should 
praise good experiences because most of us do not.  Perhaps this is not the 
soap box for this kind of thing since what we are discussing is not strictly 
a VW bus technical issue, but there are over a thousand people here that 
could possibly get the wrong idea about one of our best vendors if he is not 
defended.  These people are his primary customer base and that kind of 
silliness can really affect a small business.  Like all messages on the list 
you have the right to simply not read it.  That is after all what the delete 
button is for.  The fact that you don't care for a thread matters very 
little unless you are an administrator and would like it ended.  Other than 
that, I, and probably many others probably don't care that you do not like 
this thread and do not really have any need to know.  I also don't 
appreciate that your humor seems to some degree at my expense, and that it 
was sent to the public forum.  I especially don't appreciate that when I 
asked you about it in a private mailing you decided to post your reply again 
to the public forum.  I find these emails kind of rude, and maybe I'm just 
too sensitive, but you kinda hurt my feelings Courtney (obviously).

Harmoniously,
Jay
