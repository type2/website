Subject: Re: [T2] Darn pesky little fresh-air lever spring-clip!

&gt; one of the little spring clips used to secure the lever's operating rod &gt; 
&gt; So I need two.
&gt; Are these things available anywhere? Has anyone found a cheap and cheerful 
&gt; substitute?

I just sold 4 not 5 minutes ago. These are a bit expensive so sit down 25 
cents each.

give him a minute but Ron probably has em too.

In order to get them from me you'll have to call and talk to the owner (me) 
you know, the guy with greasy busted knucks.
