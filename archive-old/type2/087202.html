Subject: Re: [T2] ground


When I replaced my ground strap in my 78, there seemed to be someplace 
that I read that it was supposed to be a certain length....

What I wanted was a battery connector that was made like the original 
rather than the goofy(poor fitting) standard &quot;lead clamp&quot; method.

I found a good ground strap like I wanted at the local flaps.
It has 2! frame ground connectors.  Seems like it was for a Hon** of some 
sort.

It has worked really well....worth the extra $5.00 or so.

Cheers ,dave

&gt; Lots of talk about good grounds. I had to replace my
&gt; battery ground cable. I bought some flat/braided
&gt; ground strap and new connectors. I made one for the
&gt; battery to chassis ground and another to go from the
&gt; chassis ground bolt direct to the engine. I know that
&gt; the tranny ground strap handles that function but it
&gt; is old. This gives a good direct ground to the engine
&gt; and is a handy place to connect to if you have to jump
&gt; someone or get a jump that is a reasonable distance
&gt; from the battery.
&gt; 
&gt; Also my son wants a squareback. Any leads to some good
&gt; info sites would be great. P-mail me off list. I am
&gt; looking at bug vrs. squareback crashworthiness for
&gt; one.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!
