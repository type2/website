&gt;O.K. Volks, I've seen a few posts asking for where ya get this stuff, I
have no idea of quality or anysuch, I don't even own a westie, but they do
have a cool online catalog.  Heres a link that I got off this list.  If
anyone has any actual experience with these people now would be a good time
to post.&lt;


I will certainly interject my complete satisfaction with PLFVW's quality. 
I ordered the replacement canvas for my orange 74 Westy and I truly believe
that the PLFVW material is superior to the original material.  I also sent
PLFVW an old vinyl front spare tire cover and they duplicated this and this
also is better than what I had originally.  I had to send them the old one
so they would have a pattern.  Now I believe that they will now start
selling the spare tire covers.  I would highly recommend PLFVW's products
to anyone.
