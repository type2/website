Subject: Accelerator Cable

Wooh! Thanks a lot to everyone who gave me advice/comments on putting in a
new accelerator cable.  I pulled it off without a hitch, my first vehicle
self-repair!

Now I have MORE problems (natch).  The exhaust leak I was told my bus had when
I first got it is getting worse (she's stinkier) and when I started it
this morning I noticed the engine was 'wobbling' a fair bit, more than I was
used to.  Also it seems to be running a tad louder lately.  I'm going to be 
picking through my muir manual again tonight, my first thought is to
check the compression, and all of the parts of the exhaust system.  Any other
suggestions would be most welcome. 

thanks again!
