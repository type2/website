Subject: Re: [T2] A/C Condenser fans needed

David,

Don't forget to tell all of us where you found them so it will be in the 
archives.....I will probably be doing the same and looking for some for my 
78 soon.

Cheers, dave

&gt; I just wanted to say a public &quot;thank you&quot; for the great response to
&gt; this post.  Several people have offered up sets of fans for the cost
&gt; of shipping and several others replied with helpful advice or tips
&gt; on where to find alternate fans.  Because of the kindness of my fellow
&gt; listmembers, I will be back in business soon - I sure appreciate it.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I am in need of a couple of fans, the ones that sit on top of the large
&gt; &gt; &gt; square A/C condenser that is attached underneath many busses that were
&gt; &gt; &gt; fitted with aftermarket air.  Both of mine have died.  :(
