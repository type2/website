Barry or others....

I didn't see this posted to the list, so forgive me if I'm going over old
ground...
I'm not sure which Solexes you have, but on my 34 pict 3 (and I presume all
other carbs with a mixture adjustment screw), clockwise leans the mixture
out.  Think of it as the needle point on the screw as blocking off more and
more of the fuel passage, the more you screw it in, the more screw is
blocking the fuel port in the carb.
A simple explanation, I realize.
Cheers,

Someone on the list the other day mentioned the direction in which to turn
the air mixture screw on a twin solex carb setup...  was it &quot;turn clockwise
for lean&quot;?  This is on the left carb on a 72 1700cc motor...  The Follys!  I
now know I really screwed up and thought the air mixture was the idle speed
screw.  I know... Stoopid!
But that super rich set up might explain the gas in the oil!
Barry!
