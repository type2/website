Subject: Re: [T2] Vanagon Fuel Injection on Bay Window?

Scott Lyons posted


if you get all the parts it will work. most important is that the harness,
AFM and ECU are a set. many of the other bits are common to most years. do
some research in the library (FI section, there is a good part numbers
interchange matrix) and check the applicable part numbers to make sure you
are getting a matched bunch of components.


Scott,

I was told that most of the components would/could work, but that due to 
their location/placement that I might have to modify them to work. As I said 
I am new to VW FI but Vanagon, too....forget about it. Thanks for the help 
though.

Travel On and Enjoy,
