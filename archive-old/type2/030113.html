NO!!!!  

Volks, 

I had an exchnage back some years ago about finding vaccum leaks in a bus
using flammable solvents as leak detectors.  May I humbly submit that this
is not wise???  Starting fluid is an ether and has a flash point that is
*very* close to room temperature. It is also explosiver in a very wide
range of air/fuel mixtures.  This is why it makes such a wonderful
starting fluid.  Propane and acetylene are just above it and are also
incredibly flammable. To get a really damaging explosion, you need air,
fuel, spark, and compression, as we all know.  

Air:  Yup, it's planet earth and the air is present.

Fuel: ethers and gasses are explosive in a wide range of mixtures as I
said! 

Spark: Now, Bob mentions not smoking, but heck, the engine compartment of
any car does not need the introduction of a cigarette! The coil, and that
marginal HT lead to the spark plug will be *happy* to provide just the
spark you need!

Compression: Five of the six sides of the engine compartment box are
sealed with steel.  Side number six is sealed by *your* head and
shoulders. Where do you thing the weak point is? Can you say &quot;Hello, Mr.
Piston!&quot;? 

Vacuum gauges and all gauges are not 100% accurate, but they are sure as
heck safer than ethers!!!

Safer alternatives in the gas department...

CO2 -  dig out that tapping system from your college days...  CO2, being
non-flammable will cause the engine to slow when you point it at a vaccum
leak.

WD-40 - Again, it is way less flammmable thna gasoline, plus it will seal
the leak if it is thin and cause the engine to slow down.  Yes, it makes a
mess, but you are alive to clean it up.
