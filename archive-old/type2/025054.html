Subject: new screen and seal
Message-ID: &lt;9ad23ec6.243eb80b_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

I need to order a new fuel tank screen (for 72 Westy with 1700 pancake) and 
seal, when i took the old one off, i didn't see any seal on it, or one around 
that might of fallen off, however my pops said it would leak without one and 
it didn't leak, regardless, does anyone know where the seal goes in relation 
to the screen-tube-nut?  Thanks.
