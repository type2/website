Subject: Re: [T2] '78 battery drain

&gt; Before doing anything, I would recommend turning off the bus and putting an
&gt; ammeter across the battery poles. Start pulling fuses until the meter reads
&gt; ZERO. 

An ammeter has to connected in series in order to work.
It has to go between a battery post and the cable to read draw.
A small lightbulb will draw about 300ma. This will drain a low battery overnight.
