Paul raises a good point about young kids and opening doors.  But isn't the
rear door just the same as any door on the bus, though?  I mean, kids can
open the other doors if they have the dexterity and strength to do so.

Russell, who's coming up on 18 months now, loves to &quot;drive&quot; the bus while
we wait in the ferry line-up.  I've had to make sure the front doors are
locked so that he doesn't fall out of the bus, since he's figured out the
latch.  He's also nearly figured out the door lock knob, and after that, I
don't know *what* I'm going to do....

Point being, all doors hold a risk of kids falling out when they're romping
around inside the bus at the camp site, in a parking lot, where ever.
Maybe a soft pad to break their falls is called for?  Bungee the kid?  :-)

I sure hope no one on this list considers the rear door safety latch a risk
to kids while *driving*.  If so, the existence of a latch is the least of
your safety problems.  =:-O

Happy camping!

Tobin

Russell also knows how to insert the ignition key, turn it to start,
release the parking brake, and take the bus in/out of gear.  Ask me how I
know.  :-/
