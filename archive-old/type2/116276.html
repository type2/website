Subject: RE: [T2] Re: my bus has NOTHING to do with ScoobyDoo!!

It's funny that you guys mention that. I recently bought a 73 VW Bus for my
fiancee (Erica). We're in the process of moving into a new house together,
but for right now it's parked in front of her condo (it's registered and
insured). The girl just across the parking lot from her absolutely loves the
Bus. She's really into Scooby Doo and insists that the Mystery Machine is a
Volkswagen Bus. She showed me several pictures she has and says.. &quot;If you
had that spare tire on the front, it would look more like it&quot;. 

To make it worse of course, Erica has a brown Chessapeak Bay Retriever..
which resembles a Scooby Doo looking dog... 
PLUS, the Bus is a Neptune Blue!
