Subject: Re: [T2] How do you turn a tight engine

At 08:25 PM 03/19/2003, you wrote:
&gt;I explained that I could manually rotate the engine when I first put
&gt;it into the Vanagon but was now no longer able to do that, even with
&gt;the spark plugs out. The engine had less than 120 miles in it.
&gt;
&gt;Leonard said that it was perfectly normal: as long as the starter
&gt;could turn the engine, it was okay and that I was worried for nothing.

I disagree, but he is the one responsible, so do as he says. The first
thing I do upon receipt of a reman motor is install the dizzy, then grab
the pully and turn it by hand through 7200. If I can't do that, I won't
waste my time installing it.

&gt;Now, according to several people I talked to, including the local VW
&gt;shop, a tight engine like that is a precursor to overheating and an
&gt;engine failure.

If this is just a problem with a slick or loose fan belt, then do as he
says and resolve that. If the belt does not slip and you can't turn the
motor with a big wrench on the alternator nut, then I concur with the above
statement.


&gt;So I don't know how long that engine is going to last.
&gt;
&gt;Any ideas what I should do?

You should follow the advise of your builder, and if it fails, make him eat
it if you can. I'm so glad I NEVER have these issues with my rebuilder. You
might want to have someone with experience verify the problem before you
scream bloody murder.
