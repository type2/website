Howdy folks,

I have a set of 1700 P&amp;Cs for sale.  I bought them, washed them, then
realized I had 1800 heads.  It was my first rebuild, a total newbie:)
Anyway, I oiled them, then bagged each one in a zip lock and stored them.  I
have now use for them, I just looked at them and the are still oily and
ready to be used.  They are cofap brand.

$200

Anyone want them?  They are in Portland, Oregon.
