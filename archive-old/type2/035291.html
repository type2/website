Subject: Dual pressure relief?

According to the engine code my engine should have Dual pressure relief. 
First of all this may be a stupid question but what is dual pressure relief? 
Second is there some way you can tell by just looking at the engine. The 
reason I ask is because on my 1600 DP engine there are two hoses on the left 
hand lower side of the engine and there are to fittings with a hose joining 
the two together. Sometime ago the hose that joins these fittings together 
broke and I lost all of my oil. So when I look at it I thought it might be 
something the P.O. did and it still might be I not sure but anyway I tried 
taking out the hose and the fittings and installed two plugs.   Well, 
whenever the car would idle the oil light would come one and if I ran the 
engine up past an idle the light would go off. So I took out the plugs and 
installed the hoses and put an oil filter inline with the hoses this seems to 
work okay. So I was wondering if this had anything to do with the Dual 
pressure relief or not. If not has anybody ever seen or heard of the kind of 
thing before?
Thanks
