Subject: Turn Signals not working?!

Hey guys,

    It Turns out, that my turn signals aren't working properly. Not sure
what to look at first. When I hit the turn signal stalk, both the left and
right turn signal turn on (as if I had just turned on the hazards). 
Is this a wiring problem? Or is it a problem with one of the relays?


Thanks!

Todd
