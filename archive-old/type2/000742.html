How do I get piston#1 to firing position at TDC?  I could do it if the
distributer was in, but I am reinstalling it after a rebuild and need to get
it setup right. The fan marks dont help either as it was painted.   All the
manuals say to get #1 to TDC and then install tthe dizzy, but they dont tell
me how to get to TDC in the first place.  I need help soon! TIA
