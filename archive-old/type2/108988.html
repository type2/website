Subject: Re: [T2] 009... Why?

I had Philbin Group  http://philbingroup_dot_com/rebuilt/distributors.htm
rebuild my stock dizzy a couple months ago. He did a great job and for a
reasonable price. Total was $85 for complete rebuild and setting the correct
advance curve. Everything was either replaced or sand blasted and painted.
Looked nice when done. The above price did not include shipping because I
live close to the shop.

  Does anyone do this, or are there
&gt; rebuild kits available?  Do I need to spring for an SVDA?  My advance
&gt; quit advancing, and the timing jumped around a lot as indicated by
&gt; timing light.  Diagnosis: worn out.  Right?  Anyone do quality rebuilds
&gt; out there for less than the cost of a new unit?  TIA
