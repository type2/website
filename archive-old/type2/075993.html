Subject: Re: [T2] solid/hydraulic swap?



&gt; Before I started this as a profession I played for years, I can honestly say
&gt; that I have built good engine from junk, old parts. For years I never had
&gt; cam problems, mismatched lifters and etc were just fine, then all of a
&gt; sudden it all changed. for 13 months straight we were absolutely plagued
&gt; with cam failures, from every suplier except web cam.

&gt; Try the swap, drive for 100 miles and remove the oil filter, cut it open and
&gt; see what you find.if it is magnetic particles, then hold on you are in for a
&gt; ride!

My mistake, I guess I never understood YOUR problem.

Your whole 'mismatched hardness' opinion is based on aftermarket CRAP you buy.
You put together how many engines in a 13 month period that would not last more
than 100 miles using 'mismatched hardness' aftermarket parts?
I put together 2 engines over 6 years ago that have a combined mileage on them
of over 175,000 miles using Original Equipment good used parts that have matched
hardness....
And then you say I must have LUCK??

End of discussion.
