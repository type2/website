Subject: Re: gray paste in oil sump

Sami &amp; List,

I'd be very careful handling and disposing of that stuff. If the engine is
old enough to have burned leaded gas, then the gray paste may well be lead
residue. The lead didn't all go out the exhaust pipe, some of ended up in
the oil and then in the sump.

&gt;Dear List,
&gt;
&gt;I found a little bit of a deposit in the oil sump of a 1600, a gray-ish
&gt;paste. Magnesium? Tiny little specs of shiny metal could also be seen once
&gt;the paste was spread on a clean rag.
&gt;
&gt;TIA,
&gt;
&gt;Sami
