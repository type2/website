When I bought my '81 Vanagon it had a rotating pass. seat. This was not a
welded in construction. It used a swivel plate that fits on top of the
existing track and was screwed down.  It has track on top so you can use it
with the standard seat. It will raise the seat by about an 3/4 of an inch.
This was a standard VW part (still had the sticker on it). I took it out and
replaced both seats with Sportscraft seats. One of them had a built in
swivel so I did not need it any more.

Since late loafs and Vanagons have the same track I guess this part could be
used on later loaf.
