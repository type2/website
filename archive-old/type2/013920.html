Subject: Re: [T2] oil screen



&gt; 
&gt; Dang it list, what's the deal with the oil screen plate nut? Does it damage the camshaft after a meager 9ft/lbs as Muir states? Or is this 
a bunch of hooey?
&gt; 
&gt; What I'm sayin' is I'm leakin' oil. Can I get out tonight and crank this thing even more than I have or what? 

No personal experience, as I don't like to tickle the dragon, but I think that the torque warning is in enough places as to be taken 
seriously.

I've been using Hylomar non-hardening sealer on drain plugs, gaskets, and similar sealing surfaces and it seems to really help oil weeping 
problems,  It's now sold by Permatex for about $4 a tube.

&gt; 
&gt; Also, when you get the gasket kit, is it:
&gt; 
&gt; Crush washer on drain plug or screen nut?
&gt; 
&gt; With the two paper washers, I'm assuming you put one between top of oil screen flange and the place it hits the sump and one on top of 
the bottom plate that holds it all in.
&gt; 
&gt; Yea/Nea?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks, Billy.
