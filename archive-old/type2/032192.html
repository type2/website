i had the same problem in my 69 westy.  i just took a grinder and
carefully whittled away the metal until the stereo fit.  just take your
time and try not to melt the dash cover or lite anything on fire with the
sparks coming off the grinder.  and be sure to use that metal strap that
comes with the radio to support the back of it.  i attached it to the
ashtray mount and also use it as a ground.
