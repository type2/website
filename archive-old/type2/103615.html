&gt; Hi Richard,
&gt; Thanks, that's a good tip. They use it on some police cars &amp; ambulances
&gt; here too. I can only imagine the number of people who will
&gt; automatically hit the brakes as that bright white stripe is suddenly
&gt; illuminated 

Have you seen a School Bus in the Dark lately,, WOW! Captain reflection! 

I can tell you from experience,, that reflective tape works GREAT in the USA
[eastern portions I have been thru anyways]

There is a *noticable* difference in the proximity to your rear end ... Big
trucks change lanes way before I am cringing,, sometimes I can see people staged
far enough to the rear until they realize it isn't an emergency vehicle,,,
It appears to me that different states or counties us different types of
vehicles,,

Here in Eastern Canada [Ontario to Maritimes], people are too accustomed to the
same Ford Crown Vic or Chev Caprice being the cops so the reflective tape
doesn't fiz them as noticibly, they just continue to drive like idiots !  LOL
