Subject: [VB] Kelley Park musings, &amp; black wipers ??


&gt; Kelley Park this year was great for me.
&gt; I decided to park in the side lot and got in with Clara easily at 8:10 AM
&gt; when the show opened at 8 AM. No hassles and right by the side gate. We
were
&gt; cheerily let in by Lois and the entrance was right by the main swap area.
&gt; Maybe the second swap area in the back created more space than originally
&gt; planned but it was fine.
&gt; Here I made two major scores
&gt; 1) a pristine set of rear over-riders for the 63 singlecab
&gt; 2) A really nice front bumper with over-riders fro the singlecab.
&gt; Now I can USA-ize the pritschenwagen!
&gt; On the way out we found a neat guy from Pennsylvania who was selling
&gt; brochures.
&gt; He had three 63 commercial brochures
&gt; 1) Dutch language
&gt; 2) British European
&gt; 3) USA version
&gt; I bought the USA version and was staggered that some of the pictures were
&gt; identical to the European version except that had added over-riders! I do
not
&gt; know if they re-took the photographs or airbrushed in the over-riders.
&gt; I will be scanning this in and adding it to my literature site.
&gt; BTW I noticed that all the trucks had black wiper arms &amp; blades.
&gt; Has anyone ever seen black wiper blades for a 63 splitty?
