I have used the oven cleaner method for cleaning my engine tin and have to say
that it works great.  I spent a few days with carb cleaner and soap and water
with a lot of time wasted.  I spent about a total of 20 minutes with the oven
cleaner and it comes out a lot better.  I have found that it helps to scratch
up the part that you are going to clean with a metal brush so that the oven
cleaner has something to bite in to.  I let it sit for a couple of hours and
then back with the brush.  Clean metal.  I am now trying to get everything
painted and am unsure what type of paint to use.  I know flat black but I have
been told that Krylon is junk and not to use the Hi Temp Krylon as it holds
heat better.  Some one from the list posted last week that they used
&quot;Hammerite&quot; .  I sprayed a few parts  with this and it looks nice and shiny
and not really black but like a gunmetal gray color.  The can says that is
&quot;Reinforced with GlassGuard Protection.&quot;  I am thinking that this is not
really what I want as this may hold heat in more than get rid of it.  What
type of paint brands would you recommend??  I want to go flat black and not
have to do this in another year as it is a project.
