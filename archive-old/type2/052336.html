Subject: Re: [T2] how check a fuel pump?

[...]

I just replaced the fuel pump on my 71 because the diaphram was
leaking.  When
I drained the oil, five quarts came out instead of the usual two and a
half.
When I took off the fuel pump, I still had both fuel lines connected and
could
see fuel dripping from the base of the pump which was an obvious sign to
me
that the diaphram was leaking.  I installed a new Bocar pump that cost
$15.

&gt; I pulled the fuel pump from the engine which is now up on my test stand.
&gt; It appears to be a replacement unit for it has none of the features shown
&gt; in Bentley which would allow it to be disassembled and examined.
&gt;
&gt; Can anyone suggest a way to test the integrity of the diaphram? I've
&gt; disassembled much of the engine, so I can't at this time  measure fuel
&gt; pressure or cc/min delivery.
