Subject: Re: [T2] Exaust Leak

Steve:
At least a propane torch to heat the nuts red hot before trying to move
them. This is one place where you REALLY don't want to break off the stud!
Use all the normal precautions regarding burning your bus/ garage/ house
down. I really prefer to do such things outside, weather permitting.
Remember there is gasoline nearby. Best thing is to have a helper to hand
the torch to and hand you the wrench/ fire extinguisher.
I usually get the nut red hot and then move it back and forth 90 degrees or
so while it cools. There will be a bit of rust coming out, so be sure you
use safety glasses/ face shield.  After this initial breaking loose,
penetrating oil will work fine to move more rust bits out from inside the
stud/ nut. I have NEVER had much luck getting these off without the use of
heat. Penetrating oil is damn near useless untill the nut is freed. (I do
live in Iowa- center of the rust belt!)
When putting these new gaskets back on, I like to use some special exhaust
pipe sealer. I've used Walker brand- I think it's mostly clay- turns into
ceramic under the high heat conditions of the exhaust.
Another key to keeping these from leaking is to make sure you have the
prober hangers in place to support the heat exchangers. These are often
missing. That will let the heat exchangers sag at the outer edges and can't
help the sealing.
Maybe Ron or Bus Boys could get some of these re-popped or find an old
stash.
there are 2 or 3 different styles. On the bays, at least the right side is
also the alternator adjusting strap.
