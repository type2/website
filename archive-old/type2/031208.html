&gt; I am having a problem with the idle speed on my 76 westy.  When it it warmed
&gt; up everything is fine.  When it is cold, the speed is too low &amp; the engine
&gt; dies unless you keep your foot on the pedal.  I have checked the aux air
&gt; regulator.  It passes air when cold.  The hoses are tight &amp; leak free.
&gt; Everything else seems fine as far as the running goes.  Any ideas?

check the temp sensor on the #3 cyl
