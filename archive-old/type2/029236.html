I have a technique I use for a tarp. i saw it at a show and used it ever
since. I juts use the smallest spring clamps you can buy, 4-6 of them.
Spring clamps are found in woodworking tools and are kind of like big
clothespins. The have vinyl covered jaws. I fold the edge of the tarp over
a couple inches, wrap it around the lip of the drip rail and then put the
spring clamp on it. I have never had a tarp blow loose, even in pretty high
winds. The only drawback is the low roof height of the tarp. I carry an
adjustable pole to hold the middle up too.

The spring clamps come in handy for other uses when your not camping.
Another tip for you as well, if you end up desiring to put up a tarp when
parked in a parking lot, you may wonder how to run out your guy lines (I
usually only use 2, one at each corner). You can drive nails into the
asphalt easily but this is kind of obnoxious. You can also use two milk
jugs full of water although they will move on a windy day.
