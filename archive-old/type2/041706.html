Subject: California Smog Test - latest wrinkle

Those residing in California and facing the biennial test may want to come 
prepared for their next inspection with a new gas cap. Inspections now 
include a separate pressure test to verify that the gas cap retains vapors 
in the fuel system, rather than allowing venting to the outside. I recently 
'passed' emissions on an '87 Nova and a '75 Westy with flying colors, except 
that both required the purchase of a new gas cap in order to complete the 
test. You can do better by going first to your favorite FLAPS, than getting 
stuck with buying whatever the inspection station offers at an inflated 
price.
