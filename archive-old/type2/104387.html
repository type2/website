Subject: Nos Type IV case found

I have found three NOS type IV CU style cases (have port for fuel pump).
The cost about $480 without shipping (which may be up to $290 for one
case). I can get a 10% discount on price if I buy all three and maybe a
break in shipping. Though import taxes may be a problem. Anyway if you
are interested in a new case let me know and we will see what we can do.

By the way i think that I also have a line on some cases from South
Africa. I will know more by the end of the week.

Regards,
