Subject: ENGINE/TRANS WANTED WEST VIRGINIA

I am in WV, I would like to find somewhere an engine and transmission to go
in my '70. I think the Corvair engine and trans. are going to have to come
out.  Would like a good transmission, engine rebuildable or better.  Need
carb, starter, and generator too.  Thanks! Glen Ward
