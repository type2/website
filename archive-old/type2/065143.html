&gt;   On my '73 the hi-beam headlights stay on. When I try to click them
&gt;   down to
&gt;   low beams they don't.

Yes, it's most likely the relay. It's one of those silver cubes under the
fuse box. You have nothing to lose, so pry it open, experiment by applying
12 volts to the terminals and observe the mechanism at work. You'll see
how a small brass spring blade needs to be bent ever so slightly. Or
simply buy a new/used relay.
