Subject: Re: [T2] Pulling a Vintage RV with a Bus

1500 lbs is fine in Kansas. 1500 lbs in Colorado might be different. 

One our Bus the question is how much heat the engine generates/cools, how much brakes it can stop. Our bus does fine stopping 1500 lbs on dry pavement in TN. Colorado might be different... 

Wind resistance is another factor. The bigger, the more HP you consume. 

I'd hitch up to your ideal trailer and try it for a mile or two. Can you turn or stop? Can you keep up with traffic? 

Does that help? 

Personally I think towing a bus is better than a bus towing..
