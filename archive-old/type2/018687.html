&gt; When I rebuilt my engine, I had a piece of plywood on a small frame with

&gt; around the garage.  For removal, I stacked a couple of 2x12x12 blocks on my
&gt; floor jack and was able to balance the engine.  Then two of us moved the
&gt; engine from the jack to my little roll around piece of plywood.  Use your
&gt; imagination.

Just got the latest JCW catalog for VWs in the mail last week.  One new item is
a three sided engine dolly for under $30. As I priced out the wheels/casters to
make one at about the same price, one is currently winging it's way to me as we
speak...

For dropping the engine, I made up a 12&quot; square of 3/4&quot; plywood bolted to a
disc/ post set-up that fits into my floor jack (replaces the OE metal
cup/post)...  Also making a tranny adapter out of HD angle iron that fits the
same jack.

Last, but not least just finished fitting the JCW bench mounted engine stand to
a floor stand that I have had sitting around unused for a few year by cutting
off the plate from the tube and welding it into the floor stand head.  This way
if I need to use the original stand for say, a W/C engine I'll just grind off 3
small welds pop the tube out and slide the old mounting plate back into the
head.  With the VW mounting bracket I can fit a cut bell housing/starter
bracket on the engine....  Voila, instant test stand....
