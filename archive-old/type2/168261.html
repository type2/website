&gt; ooooh!
&gt; a toaster and a loaf in the same driveway. Lets make some grilled cheese!

&gt; My girlfriend's Scion constantly reminds me of old VWs. I always tell her
&gt; it
&gt; was the modern VW bus when I drive it. Its not the toaster, but the little
&gt; station wagon scion She calls her Suzie. She looks like a suzie.
&gt;
&gt; It is simplistic yet unique.
&gt; Extremely low cost of ownership.
&gt; Low maintenance
&gt; Relatively easy to fix
&gt; Reliable
&gt; Ridiculously economical; 38mpg highway ( the bus blushes in the driveway
&gt; next to it)
&gt; Tons of character
&gt; Fun to drive
&gt;
&gt; Sounds like the same things that VW made a name with in the 60's.
&gt; I love her Scion.  I never thought I would like a modern car for the
&gt; reasons
&gt; I love my buses. I was wrong
&gt;

For the love of all things sacred, PLEASE do not tell me you are putting
that bonsai mini-van (xB) in the same zip code as a bus!!!  Those things
have about as much panache as a PT Cruiser (oops, I think I just threw up in
my mouth a little).

Toyota did a great job of making a really bad looking car somehow &quot;cool&quot;.
That is the marketing team that VW needs!
