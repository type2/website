Subject: Subject: RE: [T2] 74 hi-top camper

&gt; What is the type of camper that has a large fiberglass (non 
&gt; pop-top) top?

depends, does the roof have a luggage rack notched into the fiberglass
top or is it straight?

it is either a Safare camper or an Adventurewagen. Their is also one
other that has the hardtop that actually extends past the rear of the
bus at a reverse angle, don't know what that style is called. Look for a
plaque by the side of the door with a number on it. My Safare Custom
Camper #902 has one. Does it have any conversion company stickers on the
hardtop, this might be a clue.........

I love the hell out of mine, had it two months and slept in it 5 times
when the ol' girlfriend celebrates the moon (HAHA).
