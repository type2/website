Subject: WTB: front door lock cylinder

hello, i have two type 2's on my use, -72 kastenwagen and -76 (or -77)
combiwagen converted to fire truck. on both cars the lock on the
drivers door is malfunctioning and i would like to buy new ones but
no one here in finland seems to sell them. if anyone of you have 
spare lock cylinders available could you please mail me.

i can notify you later when i get scanned the photos of my both
busses.
