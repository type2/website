Subject: Financial report of the fund drive

Hi Volks- I finally had time to add up the figures and the lists were very
generous.

PayPal- We had 44 donations totaling $969.00. The total fees were $42.74.
Cash donations totaled $686.00, so far.
The bank balance as of today is $2431.50.

I want to thank each and every one of you for the out-pouring of your
generosity.  This will keep the list free to all and we  know what a great
resource it is for our buses. Keep up the good work....... Ted
