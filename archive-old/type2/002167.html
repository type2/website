&gt;
&gt; &gt; I'm in the process of removing the interior of my 72 Westy and was
wondering
&gt; &gt; if anybody had changed the color of the seat fabric? I have an
industrial
&gt; &gt; sewing machine ( don't know how to use it yet) and have bolts of tan,
white,
&gt; &gt; light blue, dark blue, and brown vinyl. The Westy is white so I'm open
to
&gt; &gt; any ideas especially if you have pictures of the finished project. One
more
&gt; &gt; question, has anyone covered the wood in a Westy on the ceiling? I was
&gt; &gt; trying to be different and quiet the darn thing down a bit.
&gt;
&gt; What color's the exterior?


I believe it is mustard vinyl in all Westies up to 72. 73 had mustard cloth.
Starting in 74, the different color plaids arrived, depending on outside
color. You might check here:
