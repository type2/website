&gt; Are seat stand SIDE panels still available for my '78 Westy? I know people
&gt; have restored '78 Westy's before (Richard Atwell), what is being used to
&gt; recover the sides of the pedestal(s)? I see them at WCM, but only up to '76.

Is there any different from 76-79 in the pedestals?  I've own both years 
of buses and I remember them being about the same.

thoughts?
