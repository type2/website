&gt;Okay kiddies, 
&gt;
&gt;The first rule for this list is that each message MUST have bus
content,
&gt;Obligatory Bus Content - check the message you got when you subscribed.

&gt;Only exception was on Fridays when BUS humour was tolerated.

Thanks Cal.  It's about time someone pointed that out again!  

Nothing about this entire thread has done anything to improve the value
of my buses or anyone else's.  All it's doing is taking up band width,
wasting people's time, and getting a lot of good people mad at each
other.

Mr. Fitzpatrick, Mr Dolan?  Can we get a ruling?  PLEASE?
