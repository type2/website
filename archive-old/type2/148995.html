Subject: Distributor C(r)ap

So I got one of those new SVDA Mexican distributors from CIP, and got 
it all installed in my bus.  No workie.  After about three hours of 
diddling around with this and that, it turns out that the center of the 
rotor didn't touch the center of the cap.  The cap and rotor came 
installed on the distributor (both are brown).

Has anyone else had issues with cap and rotor parts not really fitting 
correctly?  I got it to work by leaving off the dust-cover and putting 
the rotor on the shaft without pushing it down all the way.  The good 
news is that it works way better than the crusty DVDA I had before, but 
it sure was a waste of time getting it to actually fire off.

Thanks to everyone who helped me figure out that a new distributor was 
probably going to fix by problems.

Enjoy,

Jonathan
