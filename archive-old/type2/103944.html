Subject: Re: [T2] Firing Order

&gt; the next person goes in to try and tune it up they will be confused. Another
&gt; issue is that the stock vacuum can and condensor can get get caught on the
&gt; case if you're trying to time a motor with a mis-aligned drive gear. So it
&gt; is always preferable to straighten out your drive gear to the proper
&gt; orientation when you get the next opportunity, but don't lose the spring in
&gt; the case.

Be very careful of that spring under the distributor drive dog. I got to
overhaul my engine at Xmas because the spring 'sprung' into one of the oil
galley holes. Muir recommends using a broken coat hanger to guide the spring
into place. I do to.

Of course, I found that my cam and crank gears were off by a tooth when I had
the engine apart. The engine runs _MUCH_ better now that the time can be set
right. Also, I found that my fan is mounted 180 degrees off so my timing marks
are 180 off. Aren't these things fun!
