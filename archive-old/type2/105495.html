&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, I have remembered that part of bus driving.  Hence my desire to move
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the spare to the front of the bus.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;I don't think VW had that add-on in mind when they did their crash testing

What crash testing, we are talking the semi dark ages here.

&gt; &gt; &gt;because the body will deform before the bumper can absorb the impact. The
&gt; &gt; &gt;Euro models had the extended bumper for the tire carrier for a reason: with
&gt; &gt; &gt;the tire mounted you increase your chance of nose damage if someone
&gt; &gt; &gt;accidentally backs into you.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Most of the cars on the road match the bumper height of the bus relatively
&gt; well, particularly if overriders are installed.  The bumper is designed
&gt; with a little &quot;give&quot; to it (that's why the mounting holes are slotted, to
&gt; allow the bumper to slide).  If you get hit on the bumper at low speeds
&gt; you are unlikely to sustain damage.
&gt; 
&gt; OTOH, the tire mounted above the bumper will transfer any impact loads
&gt; directly to the front sheet metal of your bus.  There is no &quot;give&quot; to
&gt; that, it just dents.

then there are the exceptions, couple years ago a tractor trailer driver
fell asleep at the wheel on I-81 near Scranton, he drifted sideways
accross three lanes into my side, turned my bus sideways and hit the tire
mounted on the front with the side of his trailer near the rear
wheels...the imprint of his tandem rear wheels remain in my bumper and
tire cover to this day.....I was one lucky SOB as he didn't even break the
windshield, had I not had the tire on the front I probably would have been
pulled under the trailer into the rear wheels...and not speaking here
today

&gt; PS:  Driving as if you were an Aztec sacrifice strapped to the front of
&gt; the vehicle is also helpful.  This was one thing that John Muir was
&gt; correct about.

for sure
