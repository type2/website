Subject: A Chicago mechanic?

Hello,

I need a good mechanic in the Chicago area. Anybody know one?

I am new to this list (about a month) and I have enjoyed reading your mail: Very
interesting. Thank you.

I have a '74 bus that I bought in Arizona and took with me when I moved to
Chicago for school.

[&quot;When the bus is full, I'm packed.&quot; I did the 1,600 miles in two days, stopping
only for naps and gas. Slow and easy all the way. The bus performed flawlessly.]

In Arizona old VWs of every type are everywhere. In Chicago I have seen only two
Type 2s in the three years I have been here. (Go figure.) Unfortunately,
mechanics are harder to find than Type 2s. Even the dealers I call say they do
not work on them anymore.

I need a mechanic. It is time for a thorough going through.
I also need a body and paint person. I plan to replace all the rubber and have
new paint and rust proofing applied.

Anybody have any recommendations?

Thank you for your help.

Bob
