Subject: Re: [T2] Sink stopper needed

[...]


&gt; Does any one have a spare sink stopper for a '78 Westy?  Some low-life took
&gt; mine at the last show I went to.  I was away from the bus all day at my swap
&gt; space, so it probably occurred then. I just noticed it was missing when I
&gt; went to drain the tank for winter today.

??  The stopper is the chrome drain strainer in the bottom of the bowl. Is that
what you lost?
Or the cap that screws on the bottom of the drain pipe?
Not sure how you noticed either missing if you drained the tank at the petcock
below the tank :))
