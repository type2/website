I didn't like the decaf either... so i saved everyone a bit of tactless
grief and went back to *real* coffee. 

 You cannot possibly expect a bus to
&gt; take the Canadian Rockies at a minimum of 50-60.

...unless you plan on spending a lot of money and time to get it in that
shape. You want unerring reliability, power, etc... right? The easier
option is to go with an engine swap to something a little more
bulletproof, like a watercooled setup... pushrod Subaru, TDI, et.al.. A
net-search for Kennedy Engineered Products will yield some info on how
to get in touch with them. Get a catalog and peruse it for the best swap
for your bus. Keep in mind that you will probably have to beef up the
tranny to handle the increased power of the engine... Search the
Archives for juicy bits on what to do/not to do.

 Either learn to deal with
&gt; the consternation of your fellow travelers

...and listmembers ;)

 in a serene way, or get
&gt; something stronger, because as things sit a bus is not for you.

Pshaw... keep the bus, accept it for what it can do... give in to it.
Let it gently subjugate you and assuage your innermost insecurities.
Drive it hard and fix whatever breaks. Admire the curves of your bus by
moonlight &lt;shiver&gt;... See it's reflection (and yours) in shop-windows as
you drive around &lt;careful...&gt;. 
Besides... in the nicest possible way, (and I *do* have a soft spot for
Fords) I don't think you'd like the Ford List(s?) as much :)

oh, geez. Look at the time... the drawback to sticking with real coffee.
It keeps me awake too long.
