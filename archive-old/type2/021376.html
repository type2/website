Subject: Start Troubleshooting

I'm having starting problems on the '79.  According to paperwork, the
starter was new last April, hot start relay installed in August.

She was just in the shop and the guys verified that all is hooked up
correctly.

But just 'cuz they're relatively new, doesn't mean they are good...

I figured I'd pull both the starter and relay, get a new relay and take
the starter down to the local rebuild place that'll bench test 'em.

All the wires look good, and connections are firm, but I'll take an even
closer look when I disassemble.  Battery connections are newly cleaned
and tightened.

What else can I do?  I've searched the archives and other than Bob's
story of the melted ignition wire the relay seems to have solved
everyone's problems.

Teri
