Subject: RE: [T2] Clutch friction plate

Better to buy a new disk and keep it for a spare.  If you put the old one
back in it won't last all that long!

I agree. And as for replacing all the clutch parts at once ... if you don't 
know how old a pressure plate is, you're gambling if you leave it in there. 
Pressure plates *do* fail, and they don't always show signs of wear before 
they do. I learned this lesson the hard way ... on a dirt road in Utah 30 
miles from the nearest town, which had a population of about 200. Luckily, 
one of those 200 was a retired Volks mechanic who found me a junkyard plate 
and let me pull the engine in his yard, God bless him. But, not the way you 
want to spend two days of your vacation. If you know your plate/bearing/disc 
have only 30 or 40 or 50,000 miles, fine. But if they came with the car and 
the engine's out, replace them. And happy motoring.
