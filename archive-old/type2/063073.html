Subject: Re: New purchase 

Greetings-

A friend of mine (with no online access) just purchased a '76 bus, 
cheap.  It was _very_ low on power, and the owner said &quot;it has a bad 
cylinder&quot;.  He bought it anyway, and we did a compression test tonight.   
Had 85 pounds in numbers 1, 2, and 3, and 0 in number 4.  

It looks to me like the bus has run hot.  There were no spark plug boots 
on the ignition wires.  The fuel injection has been disconnected, and a 2 
barrel Solex was installed.  The engine is extremely dirty.  The bus 
appears to have 140,000 mile on it.

My best guess is a holed piston.  I'll do a leakdown test when he gets it 
over to my house where we'll have some compressed air.  

A few questions for this list, since this is my first type IV rebuild:

Any point in going with a larger than stock p/c set?

Are the heads rebuildable, or should we look at new heads?

Any recommendations on engine kits?

Thanks for your help.

Martin Scarr
