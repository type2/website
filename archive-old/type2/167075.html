Hi Adam,

You forgot to add the obligatory reference to Petra dancing naked in  
the moonlight.

Happy Trails,

&gt; Well the header says it all.
&gt; For no good reason, except to camp, I will be holding my annual  
&gt; salute to the end of summer.
&gt; Busquinox.
&gt; Held on, or close to, the equinox, we get together for a weekend of  
&gt; nuthin'. Just Camping.
&gt;
&gt; Activities include, sitting, drinking, cooking, sitting and  
&gt; whatever else you feel like doing. In the past people have lit a  
&gt; camp fire, thrown a frisbee (very popular) and even gotten lost in  
&gt; the rain. My goal is to relax, I hope yours is too.
&gt;
&gt; The cost is whatever the gate charges, plus $4 to cover the  
&gt; reservation fee that they hit me with. Usually the gate charges $26  
&gt; per night.
&gt;
&gt; Held at the lovely and scenic Valens Conservation Area, there are  
&gt; hiking &amp; biking trails, look-outs, and cook-outs. There is a nice  
&gt; beach, swimming area, and FLUSH TOILETS.
&gt;
&gt; For more information, pm me, or google &quot;Valens Conservation Area&quot;.
&gt;
&gt; If there is interest, I will extend this to include Friday night,  
&gt; but I need to know soon. Please PM ME if you are interested in  
&gt; going both nights, as I am on digest mode for the list, and I often  
&gt; lose track of the digest posts.
