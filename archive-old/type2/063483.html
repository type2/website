Howdy again Volks!

I knew this one guy a few years ago with an '85 Dodge/Plymouth/Mitsubishi Colt.  He had a CD player in it that worked wonderfully(even if the car didn't).  FYI, The colts of this vintage have a nifty floor-console mounted radio that stands at around 75 degrees off horizontal. (points almost straight up)  This is a much more extreme angle than the average loaf.

Just a thought,
