&gt; I wish I new the story of it's paint history..  maybe it belonged to a
&gt; worker at the tub and sink coating place in town.

&gt; &lt;thinking&gt; ,,,,, I wonder if a bus body will fit on that paint line...

You can buy tub and sink paint at a decent paint store...
It's a two part epoxy based paint that can be sprayed...
Ask about the correct tip, I used a borrowed HVLP gun
to respray an old clawfoot tub...Prep is everything...
You've got to get &quot;tooth&quot; on all the surface you're
painting. And watch the time! If you don't clean the
gun before the epoxy sets...you've got a permanent
gun to set on the mantle...
Also, there's companies that'll come to your house
to respray your tub...They'd probably spray your bus
for a fee...But my guess would be that the prep would
be up to you and no guarantee on the finish...As I un-
derstand the formula, it's got minute particles of glass
in it that gives it shine and durability...

Oh yeah, you'd better LOVE white... ;-)
