Subject: Fire in the Engine Room

  Similar scenario, a couple of posts have spoken of needing to
 get into the engine room quickly in case of fire.

 I don't like that approach.

 The one fire I've had was a smolderey thing till I opened the hatch.

 I'd like to pursue the feasability of a CO2 bottle connected to the 
engine room and tripped from the outside essentially smothering it.

 Now the question or plural. How does a pilot know he has a fire in
the starboard engine outside of physically seeing it?

 I'm asking if there are sensors for this purpose that might be adapted.

 TIA   west
