they _should_ be if they are stock but because of the poor quailty
mufflers avaliable for that exhaust system many folks are going to an
older 72-74 system which is much better.  this has the heater box  and
manifold together and it is (more or less) a header.  these are avaliable
new from a number of sources.

one way to tell is does your connection between the exhaust and the
muffler have a triangular connecter or a sort of loaf shaped rectangular
connector.  the triangular is the 75-78 the loaf shape is the 72-74, all
have oval ports.  (I would suspect the 72-74 would transfer more heat as
it has more transfer surfaces too.)

the heads are the same but the exhaust and heater boxes are different

this is why my old ones are avaliable, I found a complete early exhaust
system and swapped it out.  got tired of replacing mufflers every 10,000
miles..I told the story here of crawling out from under my 78 and bending
the whole exhaust system by pulling myself out with it.  and it was almost
brand new and the best I could get for that model.

Ron from Bus Depot could give you all the details and prices etc.

you might want to give this some thought before spending $$$ on a part
that is really less than well designed.  little bit more up front but less
in the long run.  

&gt; be removed to get this info?  Also, I am in search of a fuel filler

one of the list members got some new from VW in Australia and had em
shipped about a year ago... I don't think he has any more and getting em
here is a exercise in frustration.  there are some fixes listed in the
library I think, I know they were posted
