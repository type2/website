Subject: Thanks from the bottom of my boots

To many of you...
(and you might have forgotten who you are)

John Muir, were he with us, would attest that I completed the hands-down
messiest job of VW ownership yesterday - not the first time, probably not
the last -
Servicing my CV joints!
Every time I tackle this I forget how much my arms, neck and back ache when
you're through.
No exception today. Ouch.
I also forget the particulars of the job til I'm elbow deep in the
gray-black moly grease void. Ick.
Anyhoo, special thanks to the posted advice on this job in our wonderful
archived library (ie: Joel &quot;half a tube per boot&quot; Walker, etc)
Before doing any work on the bus, I consult CW in the form of the archives
- even if I 've done the work before. Always pick up a new tip. It's great.
Just wish I had more luck with those steenking pinch hose clamps on the
small end of the boots. They slip and squirt off every time I go to tighten
them, until - as I know ya shouldn't do - I break down and cinch a
screw-down hose clamp in place instead.
I wish such maintenence jobs on no one. But if they must be done - and from
time to time they must - thank goodness for those archives!
Jeff
