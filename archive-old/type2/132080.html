&gt; Scott,
&gt; 
&gt; Just one question-
&gt; 
&gt; What's the benefit of dropping in a oil temp gauge that you can't keep
&gt; an eye on when your driving the vehicle?
&gt;
 
Terry, List,

I don't see I that way at all.

Let's say you have a concours restored 356. You have a new engine built and
put in. You are dialing in the engine and doing some drive, stop, adjust,
drive, stop adjust etc. Ever done that? I do it all the time, and I am in
the back of the vehicle seconds after I stop. Now you see the gauge and it
WILL tell you important information. And you have done this without cutting
a hole in your dash, running wires etc. Once the engine is dialed in, the
engine condition is known and confirmed, you don't need it as much at that
point in time.  I have seen this product, it is beautifully designed, well
made and I can see a real usefulness to it. I wish I had designed it.
