Michael
  Having seen posts from you in the past I have to say I  believe you..

I am definitely NOT an expert and apologize if I have ever written
anything to present myself as knowing more than the difference between
my ass and a hole in the ground.  
.....LOL!!!

I apologize if I've misled anyone at any time about my level of
knowledge -- hey, I'm just a common spud with an old bus that I drive
every day... certainly didn't mean to step on anyone's toes... kinda
baffled at the level of venom in the post I received...

I have experienced e-mail as being a rather misleading form of communications
as I tend to joke around a bit an it seems to get lost in the translation in e-mail.
Sometimes we read meaning into statements that is not there ... A deep breath and restraint
should be the first reaction. Then get a clarification from the sender.. If indeed it
is a msg worth slamming then go ahead. This kind of instant knee-jerk reaction
is very similar to road rage.... Impersonal, remote and assumption of bad intent. I
expect more from this crowd actually and have almost always gotten it. Any times
I have made an error in giving info or advice I have been gently corrected. This is
one of the more civilized worlds that I deal with these days... Lets keep it that
way and move on Volks.

            Peace,
                    Daniel Axel Simmons
