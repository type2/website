Subject: Driving with open engine compartment

Hey everybody, happy Friday.

Every couple of days I see a fella driving by in his 68-70 bus with his 
engine compartment door off (meaning not just open, but not there).  I 
only get a quick look as he speeds by, but his engine looks like the 
same single port 1600-ish engine I've got.  Is there any good, possible 
reason for him not to have the engine bay door?  Just wondering in case 
I ever meet up with him...
