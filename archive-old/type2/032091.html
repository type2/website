Dear Mark,

Welcom to the family. I have a '78 too. By many estiomates, it's the best
year for fuel injected buses, in some ways the best year of all.

I'd echo everything that Pete Galt wrote about the fuel system. And when
replacing all rubber fuel lines, don't forget the little secion in the
driver's side air tower, which is almost invisible up there unless you are
specifically looking for it. You can feel it easily by sticking a hand up
there.

There have been discussions here before about the procedure for pulling
the gas tank.  Someone once wrote that it IS possible to remove the gas
tank with the engine in, but it's DEFINITELY a severe PITA. I think you
probably need at least to strip down the top of the engine to make room,
i.e. remove the plenum, oil breather, heater air fan, lots of hoses and
other paraphernalia to make as much room as possible for that tank to come
straight out and up from it's resting place behind the big cover at the
front of the engine compartment. Do yourself a favor and just drop the
engine. Then it's pretty easy.

I had a host of very annoying intermittent fuel delivery problems until I
pulled my gas tank (with engine out) and had it steam cleaned out by a
radiator shop for about $50. Sounds like that's exactly what you need.
It's a common problem.  Cleared up all my fuel problems at the time.

And to Pete: You can replace the fuel level sender in place if you
carefully cut a hole in the sheet metal above it. The PO of my bus did
that- I've got about a 4&quot; on a side hole directly above the fuel sender in
the metal that's under my way back  cushion in my Westy. And my gas gauge
works.

Drive safely,
