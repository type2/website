Subject: Re: [T2] Parcel Tray

As far as Underdash Parcel Trays, there are choices....
 For the past 13 years Bus Boys has manufactured an almost exact repro of
the original Dealer Accessory Tray. Go to this link:
 http://www.bus-boys_dot_com/bbaccess.htm#parcel
 The photo was provided by me in 1993 taken from the Dealer Accessory Book.
Yeah, a bit pricey at $195, but looks so kewel and original.
 If you're into Bamboo Repro ($109) of a similar vein, check out:
 http://www.airheadparts_dot_com/index.asp?PageAction=VIEWPROD&amp;ProdID=4942
 or if in Vinyl ($159):
 http://www.airheadparts_dot_com/index.asp?PageAction=VIEWPROD&amp;ProdID=4939
 Unfortunately, they don't have photos yet uploaded, but these are really
nice and fit very well, even though they're made in the Far East.

&gt; I've wanted BD's plastic ones for a while, but just can't justify the $$
&gt; when there are so many other things I need. I think I may see about making
&gt; my own when I get my cabinet finished (half way done!)
