&gt;  By the way, this is a single reservoir
&gt; system, huh?  Damn, is there an upgraded mastercylinder for these things?

No, you have a dual master cylinder with a reservoir on top of it. The
little single up on top is a second reservoir. When you fill it, it keeps
the main one filled.
If you just lost a rear cylinder, you have something wrong with the front
brakes. The pedal should have stopped about 3.4 the way down and stopped the
bus on the fronts. The fronts are a lot larger then the rears. The fronts do
about 2/3's of the stopping power.
