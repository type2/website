&gt; the reverse threads is because propane is considered a fuel, like Acetylene.  
&gt; That's why - so you don't get them mixed up with the &quot;air&quot; or &quot;oxygen&quot; 
&gt; regulators and stuff!

Aha! I never use those other gases so I had no idea. Clever clever...

&gt; ...Or maybe just a 
&gt; way to hook a 5 gal. tank inline... (Any ideas??)..

I think Ron Salmon or someone was selling new tanks once. Ron?

I've looked into it just a bit. The stock stove wants low pressure gas. 
The stock tank has a pressure reducing thingy in the line. The Coleman 
stoves want high pressure gas. So you'd need to either salvage the 
existing stock pressure reducing thingy and use it or else put another 
one in the line from the tank to the existing stove. 

I don't think you need to actually remove the old one to get it 
inspected. You just need to figure out who inspects them. last time I was 
in San Diego looking, no one could tell me where to go, but no one would 
fill one without a certificate of inspection from someone that they 
couldn't name. If yours is safe, then you should pass the inspection no 
problem once you figure out whointhehell the inspector is.

Drive safely,

PS- Get a better sleeping bag for those cold nights before you die of CO 
poisoning in your bus, you silly, dear person!
