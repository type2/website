&gt;Really, I guess it's a good question, why do I need three?? It seems 
&gt;obvious to me, but How do I explain it?? Anybody else been in this 
&gt;situation?!?!?!?

&quot;The same reason you need _____ (10, 20, 30,?) pairs of shoes, darling.&quot;

:)

My husband and I have a deal - he can collect as many classic arcade 
games, LPs, and live music CDs that take up about as much space as 
does my bus.  He's just about there.
