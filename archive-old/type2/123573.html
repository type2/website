Subject: new key without locksmith

is there a way to determine the key code for our ignition locks (in my case
75) without pulling the lock - is the code stamped on the cab door or cargo
door handles (same key), or can the code be requested in the states or
germany? the dealership in eugene sez no dice. i do have two steel key
blanks, but would hate to make copies from my lone wimpy brass and clearly
fading existing key.   - steve
