Got this off the woodworking news group.

&gt;About 25 years ago, a friend of my father was tearing down an old brick
&gt;house and offered my dad free bricks.  Dad decided that a new brick patio
&gt;and front walk would be just the ticket.  We removed the middle seat from
&gt;our VW bus and headed to the site.  We spent a couple of hours neatly
&gt;stacking bricks in the bus until we had a cube about 5x5 feet x 3 feet
&gt;high.  I have no idea what it weighed, but the bus wouldn't even move.  It
&gt;just groaned and stalled.  So we spent another hour unloading two-thirds of
&gt;the pile. Just because it fits, doesn't mean it's a good idea...

I carried a ton of manure in bags in my '59 w/36hp once. Slow to get going
but it was a smooth ride.
