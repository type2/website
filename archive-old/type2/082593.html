Subject: Re: [T2] Timing for 009 Distributor? 

Edward writes:

&gt; Just upgraded to a 009 Distributor and Pertronix Ignitor (Part Number 184=
&gt; 7V) on my '71.  Stock engine.  Still had the original Bosch distributor w=
&gt; ith points.  Timing for that was 5 degrees ATDC at idle.  Was told that i=
&gt; t's 7 degrees BTDC at idle for the new arrangement.  Sound right?  

perhaps, but not necessarily.

Your 1600DP should run at 29-30 BDTC when fully advanced.  In other
words, when your dizzy will not advance the timing any more (which
is at about 3200 RPM for the 009), the #1 should fire at 30 BTDC.

The stock vacuum adv. dizzys had ~34 degrees TOTAL ADVANCE, so by
timing them at 5deg ATDC _at_ idle, you knew you'd be ~29 deg BTDC
when fully advanced.  Since the 009's don't have a reliable amount
of &quot;total advance&quot; you time them at their full advance (3200 RPM)
to 30 deg BTDC.

Hoop goes into a lot more detail here:

Any more than 30 deg BTDC will cause your engine to overheat...ask me
how I know.
