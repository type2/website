Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Swap Info?

This entire argument about real busses, right busses, good busses and 
so on will never be solved.  Didn't Emanual Kant, the philosopher 
explain that truth, goodness and even morality is unique to each 
individual since we all view our world from a slightly different 
perspective?  I started driving VWs in Southern California in the mid 
sixties so a modified (more power and better handling) aircooled bus is 
right and good to me.  It may not be for the other 999 people on the 
list.
