Subject: Re: [T2] Fri--What is it with the dead?

&gt;what is interesting about the greatful dead, and what is their connection 
&gt;to
&gt;busses?

I can't explain a single other thing about those guys, but this one's easy: 
it was a hippie thing. The Dead had a lot to do with drugs and hippies, and 
buses did have a big part in the hippie movement.

I don't get it, personally. I do love the way it shocks people when they 
pull up alongside a big old &quot;hippie van&quot; which is blaring the Sex Pistols, 
though.

&gt;Pardon my pedantry.  I have only come here seeking knowledge; things they
&gt;would not teach me of in college.

Good quoting job!
