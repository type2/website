Having now put 17,00 miles in a 74 bus with an upright motor, I feel I
mus put in my two cents. It was a wise decision! I can keep up with
traffic and if I wanted to go 90 mph I would have not bought a bus in
the first place. Same for A/C, and we had over 90 days of over 100
degree temps in Laredo last year!
