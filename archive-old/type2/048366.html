Friends,

My bus and I are embarking on a journey from Austin, TX up to Minnesota in 
ten days or so, and I have a few questions for you.

1. I need a place to sleep in Wichita, KS and in Sioux Falls, SD. If any 
listees live in or near those cities, please let me know. I am not too too 
sure if I want to be sleeping in the bus in these wintery temperatures.

2. If I dont find anywhere to crash in the aforementioned cities, do you 
folks think I would be okay sleeping in the bus? I have no source of heat 
once that 1600 is shut off, but I have plenty of blankets. I have never 
travelled up through the midwest before, so any advice would be appreciated.

3. My oil light doesnt seem to work. A teacher of mine (with a volks) told 
me that the light should come on when the connector is grounded to the case 
if the wire is good. Well, mine doesnt (and yes the key was on). Any ideas? 
Id like to have an oil light for this trip, as Im sure you folks can 
understand.

4. Is there anything I should tune differently or any adjustments I should 
make for the cold temperatures?

5. I am going to put new oil in my transaxle, and I was wondering if the 
80-90 weight would be suitable for the cold. I cant get my bus into first 
once the outside air hits 45F...so naturally I worry about the transaxle in 
temperatures of around 20F. Should I sink money into the Amsoil synthetic 
stuff or will the regular 80-90 wt be okay?

For your information: My bus is a 1969 SO-67 Westfalia. Engine: 1600 DP with 
a 30PICT1 and an 009. Everything else is stock.

If the list would like I would be happy to write a few trip reports along 
the way.

Thanks,
Ethan Simpson and Panama Red the Bus.
