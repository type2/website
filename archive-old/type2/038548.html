Subject: Re: Hose running to the Air cleaner?? Need Advice!!

I know this one! It's the breather box hose and mine wasn't even on my
bus when I got her. Two months and a couple of mechanics later, David
Schwarze was the one who notice it and mentioned I might want to get one
of those. It's not vital, but it's a good idea. I think he said it
routes the blow-by gases to the air cleaner so it doesn't gunk up your
engine (correct me if I'm wrong, David or anyone else). If I recall,
it's standard 1/2&quot; air hose, available at any FLAPS.

Of course, you have a 71 which would have the upright engine, and I have
a 73 which has the pancacke engine so I may be wrong.

&gt; Hello Everyone..I am a bit confused...today I was driving my newly bought 71
&gt; Westy out around town..made a few stops..it was driving great..just
&gt; purrring...then of course I stop at the local AutoZone to pick up a few
&gt; things--come back out and my engine will not turn over...so I had to get a
&gt; jump from someone..and figured I would go back later to get a new
&gt; battery...But here is where it get a little hairy...I was snooping around my
&gt; engine..trying figure out how to get the battery out..and I noticed a
&gt; hose(Does'nt look like a typical rubber hose..but it has that sort of fabric
&gt; outside to it) was connected to one end and seemed to have slipped off the
&gt; other end..If you visualize the where the dipstick is...there is a metal line
&gt; that comes straight up from there..attaches to this hose I have just
&gt; described and then It looks like it runs to the air filter...Could that have
&gt; been my problem with it not starting?? Hope it didn't screw up my
&gt; engine...but I guess what I am asking is: That hose is meant to connect to
&gt; the air Filter? If someone could help me out I would appreciate
&gt; it..Thanks..Adam
