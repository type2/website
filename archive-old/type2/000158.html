Subject: Skid Pan?
Message-ID: &lt;0.c966f828.25313051_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

I have two buses, a Seventy and a Sixty-nine. Both are missing the pan like 
cover under the center front of the bus. I checked the local junk yard and 
only one bus had one still on it. That pan was pretty beat up. Besides junk 
yards is there any source of these pans? Does someone make an after-market 
replacement? Obviously it is not essential, so many do not have them. It may 
help protect several components during cold/wet weather. Maybe someone with 
one in good shape and the entrepreneur spirit would use it to make fiberglass 
copies for those of us without one(or two).     
Thanks
Dana
