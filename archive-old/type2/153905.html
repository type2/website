Subject: Re: [T2] Hydraulic lifters and Webcam 107i

Well,


I have used this same motor set up in the past.

It is not mandatory to use 1 1/2 turns of preload.  Why not try zero lash  + 
1/4 turn?  I have done such minor things, and had full lift AND quiet 
lifters.  Experiment.

You have already discovered your issue..............the preload of 1 1/2 
turns is not letting everything open and close properly.  It may work fine 
on a worn out motor, but on a new one, everything is still fresh.  Back off 
on the preload and all will be well.

Plus, remember you are experimenting with a new FI system.............you 
can bring the idle up by adding advance because you have a vacuum leak with 
the valves not closing all the way :)
