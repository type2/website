Hi all, I just recent bought (at a very reasonable pirce) my first vw bus..
it needs some work..  Ok, this is what happened... the engine was running
fine for about 100 miles, then all of a sudden there was oil on the back
window (a light splatter) and smoke coming out of the engine compartment..
the smoke after about 3 miles wasn't to noticeable... Anyway, I stopped at a
gas station and went looked under the back side of the bus and there was a
steady stream of oil leaking out. .. at the time of the smoke I was going
about 60-65 through out the journey, and I just turned on the heater right
before it happened (though I'm not sure that has anything to do with it..)
Anyway do I have to replace a seal and is there an easy way to do it besides
pulling the engine?  Thanks again, and it's good ot be here..

Mike
