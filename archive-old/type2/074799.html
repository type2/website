Subject: FS: 1978 Standard Poptop

I am selling my 1978 Standard Poptop camper.  119K miles, Sage Green.  Has
the following new items:

Clutch kit (pressure plate, clutch plate, throwout bearing - front engine
seal (flywheel seal) also changed, engine compartment seal (foam) also
changed)
Clutch and Accelerator cables changed (preventative!!)
All fuel lines changed, new unleaded upper elbow (gas filler hose)
Rebuilt wiper motor
New outside rear mirrors
Rear shift coupler changed to urethane
Berg Locking shifter (30% shorter throw)
Retractable seat belts (new)
New tires (including spare) - Yokohama Y365 LT 195/75R14 Load range D, 1700+
lbs./tire
Rear brakes rebuilt (new slave cylinders, shoes, springs, etc.)
New windshield and seal (no leaks)
Locking gas cap

Engine and Trans are original, and run/work fine.  Engine (2L w/hydraulic
lifters) has lots of power (for a bus, let's be realistic!!)  Has had a
recent tune up complete with valve adjustment, and lots of oil changes
(comes with 4 or 5 Mann oil filters).
Comes with a full van cover, owners manual, camping supplement, etc.
Original paint is faded (surprise!!)  Some light surface rust (cosmetic) -
no rust through / holes
Shocks were replaced by PO with hydraulic KYB in front and Gas-A-Just in
rear
Muffler was replaced by PO, no leaks
Has face off Pioneer AM/FM/Cassette in dash w/door speakers
All camping gear in good condition (shows some wear, but not worn out)
including Kid Kot.

I bought this from the second owner, who bought it from the original owner
when it was ~9 months old!  Any questions, or if you would like photos, let
me know.  I am in the SF Bay area of California.  Asking $5750 OBO.
