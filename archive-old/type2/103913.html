Subject: RE: [T2] Optima Batteries

I had one - forget where I got it.  It was pretty wimpy, so much so that I
could not tell whether or not it was actually working.  It did manage to
light it's LED when the sun shone on it.  I killed it when I left it on top
of the bus in the rain - turns out it was not the least bit waterproof.
IMHO, save your money.

  Any one use those genuine VW solar trickle chargers that are being sold on
&quot;an internet auction site&quot;, they plug into the cigarette lighter of any car?
The run about $25 with shipping.  Laura
