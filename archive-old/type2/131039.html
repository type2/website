Subject: noise identification

Hi all

I have a noise coming from the driverside wheel.
It's a rotational squeak. It will sorta go away when the brakes are
pressed. At first I thought it had something to do with the used
(but new) disc pads from my other bus (with calipers) but now
I don't think so.

Is there a bearing in there that has to be greased? Or do they
just get replaced? Any thoughts about the culprit?

If you do, whats the verdict on degree of swearing involved to
fix it and money :) Can I do it myself?

Thanks ahead of time.
