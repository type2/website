Re. condensors and reliability:

I had a stutter in my '78 after a rebuild. It got worse at high speed. 
little hesitations and dropouts. I went to the dealer (VW in Encinitas, 
CA). The mechanic cringed visibly when I told him I'd just rebuilt my own 
engine and it had a problem and I wanted him to fix it. He smiled big and 
relaxed when I opened the hatch and he saw a really clean and nice engine 
with everything in order. 

Anyways in something under an hour he determined that the screw holding
the condensor to the distributor was not tight enough. Since this screw
serves as the condensor's ground, this was causing my stutter though the
condensor was brand new and fine. 

It was a very quick and easy solution to a vexing problem that could have 
taken all winter and many hundreds of dollars not to solve.

Check it out before you do anything expensive.

Good luck,
