&gt; I was just thinking... If I just dropped an intake seat on #1, what are the

who knows, if the seats were put in right they shouldn't come out, one
thing might be to get a temp guage and make sure you don't overheat that
is the biggest enemy of an air cooled engine

&gt; Should I sell my VW and buy a small block Chevy?!?

nah, they have their own set of problems
