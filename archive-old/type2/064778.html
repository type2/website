Subject: vibration and hard gear shift  - '74 1800

Hello all

I've got a problem with my '74 1800 camper which I think is related to the 
gear shift linkage. When using the engine to slow down in second gear, eg. 
slowing down for a sharp corner, sometimes there's a loud vibrating noise 
which seems to eminate from underneath the cargo bay floor, and which I 
can be felt through the gear stick.  I'm convinced that it isn't related to 
the gearbox as I've put in another gearbox recently and the noise is still 
there. Also, on both gearboxes third gear is hard to get into from second 
gear, either when moving or stationary. I've read Bob Hoover's sermon on 
'Hard Shifting in the VW Bus' and am now suspicious that the two problems 
are related and are symptomatic of worn nylon bushing(s?) that contain the 
shifter-rod in the housing.

Has anyone else dealt with these problems before - am I on the right 
track?

Cheers
