Subject: RE: [T2] Polarity flip!

A little late chiming in on this one but here goes...



It's true that this can happen.  I can't recall the chemistry of the
situation but this reversal of polarity is a big deal when batteries are run
in series banks.



As far as I remember it can only happen when a battery is deeply discharged
under heavy load.  Recalling my submarine battery days there was a low
voltage limit at which the battery bank would have to be disconnected to
prevent too deep of a discharge.  If one cell were to reverse it could
supposedly cause a fire due to circulating currents or something.



My head hurts from thinking now.
