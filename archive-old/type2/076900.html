Subject: Re: [T2] Happy Friday - Bus encounter...


&gt;I see the same thing here in the Toronto area. When the new beetle came out
&gt;the price of aircooled beetles doubled instantly, they were &quot;Collectible&quot;.


Same here in tiny town Tennessee.

&gt;They sit unrestored &amp; forgotten until they are too rusty to move and 5 hard
&gt;winters later they go off to the crusher without doing anyone any good.
&gt;
&gt;Now buses are going through the same cycle; a rusty wreck that hasn't turned
&gt;a wheel in years will still command a US$2K asking price, even though it
&gt;will need at least that or more just to get it back on the road. And I have
&gt;yet to see a single ad that doesn't mention a recently rebuilt engine.


Me neither. I would always plan on a new motor no matter what - look how 
many folks have new motors that croak on this list.

&gt;Well, what can you do? Just be all the more appreciative of what you've got,
&gt;that's what. Look after it carefully, tend to its troubles regularly and it
&gt;won't wind up in the care of those not-so well-meaning.

I am careful to grab up what I figure will wear out on my bus when the 
cheap opportunities present themselves - extra transaxles, motors, 
starters, etc. Most of them have value as cores and little else but 
sometimes these old parts will last long enough to save up money or time to 
repair my good stuff (or just rebuild your cores ahead of time).

I just wonder how many VW's have to disappear before they reach collector 
status. I don't expect our VW's to reach mid-fifties T-bird, Chevy or 
Corvette status of course.

180K miles and shooting for 400K miles.
