Subject: STUPID QUESTION... PLEASE HELP

I have a 76.  Have never pulled the engine, til last
week.

Normally, on older and newer bus, the trans swings
from the main mount, towards the front of the van.

My 76, .... Lifted the van, pulled the four main
bolts, lowered (tried) the engine, but the damn trans
hung up.  Eventually, I wiggled the damn engine out
and away from the bell housing, but shit.  Next
morning, I looked closely and saw two bolts at the top
of the bell housing, probably suspending the transaxle
up.  I thought the darn thing was just hung up on a
stuck cv joint.  Of course I placed a jack beneath the
tranny, just in case.

QUESTION.... ARE THOSE BOLTS REQUIRED.  SHOULDN'T THE
TRANNY SWING FREE WITH THE ENGINE WITH NO MOUNTS IN
THE MIDDLE OF THE TRANS AND ENGINE (I.E. ABOVE THE
BELL HOUSING)?????????????????
