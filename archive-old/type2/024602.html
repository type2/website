With all this talk og the Bulley website (fantastic !! by the way) I too now
have a question;

My 73 is completly gutted of the interior and being prepped for the noise
solution presented by Bulley.  My question is &quot;Should I go ahead and paint the
floor with POR 15 before the rest of the suggested coatings or will it be
terribly redundant?&quot;

TIA
