Subject: Re: [T2] Power Inverter in a 74 Westy question for the electronics
 wizards

What you have is a transformer. Somewhat like a battery charger.

It is easy to take alternating current and make direct current out of it 
and to reduce the voltage in the process.

It is &quot;relatively&quot; difficult to take direct current and convert it to 
alternating current of the correct frequency and voltage.

So no, you can't just run power through it backwards and get house current. 
I wish we could though...

A transformer is used to take 110v to 12v. It is also used to go from 12 
volts to 110 volts BUT it can not change direct current to alternating 
current.

To take low voltage direct current and make higher voltage alternating 
current you need an inverter.

I saw a low wattage inverter yesterday (maybe 120 watts, 120 volts) at 
Lowe's for $45 yesterday - that's enough to run a TV (better to use a 12 
volt travel TV), laptop, battery charger for a laptop or camcorder, etc.

Any accessories that you can buy to run directly on 12 volts would better 
(more efficient) than doing a bunch of conversions which all have their 
inefficiencies - generally lost as heat.

Look at www.howstuffworks_dot_com   for better explanations.

I have a 6 year old 600 Watt Inverter from the &quot;Power to Go&quot; Co. Has been 
very faithful. Never ran hot enough for the internal fan to come on and it 
has been roughed around a bit.
