Subject: upright conversion (engine options)

List,
So Mark Dearing is working on an upright conversion... I did an upright conversion on a 2.0L, Joe Cali style.  I am very pleased with the results so far.  I would be interested to see what you come up with Mark.  Are you designing a new concept?  Will it be something the bus enthusiast could accomplish at home?  Will you sell kits?  I had a lot of fun and got a lot of satisfaction out of doing it myself.  I am of course not completely finished, I still need some sheet metal painted, etc... but I've driven it on a few long distance camping trips, with the wife, 4 kids, and a small trailer full of &quot;stuff&quot; and I am very pleased with the power it has over the 1600 dual port that was in there.  And it also went into a 68 camper, which has issues all of it's own in the form of no transmission mount that needed fabbed, etc.  Please keep us posted!

I am also looking to rebuild my carbs (Dell 40 DRLA's) for the first time, and I am a little nervous.  Just the fact that I have never done it before, I guess.  Any pointers or advice on this would be greatly appreciated.      

Mark
