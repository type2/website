&gt;Anyone ever visit Wilson's Salvage in Oklahoma City?
&gt;
&gt;Derrick Zimmerer of WayOut Salvage in Kingston, AR said it was the largest
&gt;VW graveyard in the US.
&gt;
&gt;Anyone care to confirm or refute this?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks! Joe

Yes, they say it is the largest, and it probably is.  Trouble is it is not
the best run, as several parts rust out in the open (convertible early
Ghias, some cars left with windows down, interior floods).  They are pricey
too, unless you put up a fight.  I go there regularly for myself, and for
parts to sell.  Anybody that comes this way to find parts, bring your tools,
or an attitude, you will need one or the other.  Incidentally, if you are
looking for something, drop me a line (as they are often good about not
checking to see if they have something, instead they just say &quot;No&quot; and go
on) if you are trying to find something.  They do give me a better price
than the public.

I slam these guys because so many good vehicles have wasted here.  Believe
it or not, he ( the owner ) crushed a 21-window.  Body was complete with
almost all the glass!  Damn waste!  I feel bad putting down a 'friend' in
the business, but I figure you guys (and gals) need to know the truth.
