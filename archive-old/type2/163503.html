&gt; This stuff is high and getting higher.  I do not know of a way to avoid or
&gt; minimize these expenses.
&gt;
&gt; Paint guns and computers get less expensive all the time to compensate, I
&gt; guess.

Gillette usta run specials...Buy a coupla packs of blades and they gave you
the
razor free...
Printers are like that too...a coupla cartridges and you've spent the cost of
the
printer...Epson, for one that I know, puts a chip in the cartridge that tells
the
printer that it's too low on ink to print. Even if you use the refill kit,
the chip
won't let the printer print... ;-(
