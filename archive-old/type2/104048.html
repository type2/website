Subject: Re: [T2] remanufactured half axles reliability??

&gt; &gt; Well, I am finding that it will cost me more to replace boots etc. on
&gt; &gt; my current that to pay for replacements. Any body have experience with
&gt; &gt; auto zone or other remanufactured half axles????? Do they last? TIA!
&gt;
&gt;Considering that the life of CV joints is usually over 100K miles
&gt;(sometimes _way_ over), there is probably not enough data out there for
&gt;the time that the reman axles have been available.
&gt;
&gt;I'm a bit suspicious of the idea of &quot;remanufacturing&quot; CV joints.  Sounds
&gt;to me like they are taking old axles, keeping the OK CVs, and making up
&gt;the deficit with new CVs.  Could be a good deal, could be a
&gt;failure in
&gt;1000 miles.

I'm told that a typical rebuilder bores out the grooves to a larger 
standard size and then reassemble the joints with larger diameter balls. 
Now whether anything is heat treated as well as the factory or not I do not 
know. I'm not too worried as they are easy to swap unlike an internal 
engine or tranny part.

My question is how long will the boots last?
