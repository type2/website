&gt; the connection points are unattached except for the front passenger side
&gt; bottom.  Can anyone help?

Figure out why, look carefully 3 attachment points, oddly the bottom
is the one that usually goes, if it is intact and keeping the door in 
position and the track is not rusty, look further.  The center point
attachment slides on a rail under the trim cover below the rear window
a screw at the front and rear hold the cover from below, then you pull
out the bottom of the cover and shove/bang it up hard as it is secured
along the entirety of the top edge in a little channel with a plastic
fender bead.  So now you tip the door back up putting the top roller
into its roller track, then put the middle roller back on its rail.
This has to be done at one of a couple spots, you will notice this 
little wheel rolls on the rail then this little nylon slider block
a couple inches from the wheel hold the thing in, the rub is that the
slider block only goes in in a couple of places along the rail where
a little notch is missing.  If I have to guess likely the top roller
became loose and allowed the top first to fall out causing the problem.
The top and bottom rollers are adjustable to make them tighter in their
tracks and to adjust the position of the door in frame.  The adjustments
are obvious use common sense to put it right and clean all the tracks
with solvent then lube with a good moly or marine grease.

PS the door is very heavy, quite a bear in fact, 1 person can just
remove/install if you know what you are doing and risk hitting your
paint.  Best to prop the rear end on something (milk crate nice) when
installing alone while putzing with the forward end or have somebody
help.
