Subject: Fuel pressure and mixture
Message-ID: &lt;C51ED84B6F47D211917A0000F8BCBD11011F4C3B_at_zcard00g_dot_ca.nortel_dot_com&gt;

One of the manuals I have in its explaination of the FI system explicitly
states that the
fuel pressure regulator adjusts the fuel pressure at the injectors, and
hence the mixture
as a function of engine load. I states that engine load IE: Throttle
position, RPM... is related to 
the manifold vacuum.
