&gt; &gt; What we call &quot;vacuum advance&quot; distributors are't really advancing with
&gt; &gt; vacuum, at least not manifold vacuum.  The vacuum signal to the

&gt; &gt; opening and airflow through the carburator.
&gt;
&gt; huh???  how do the Fuel Injected ones work then, no carb yes the vacuum is
&gt; in the air intake flow but not part of either the Carb or Fuel injectors.

I've no idea, as I don't have FI.  Isn't there still a throttle body with
a butterfly valve?  This could be a place where the signal is picked up.

My take on how the vacuum advance system works on a carb is this:

Closed throttle, no airflow past the signal hole (it's slightly above the
butterfly), no vacuum signal.

Part throttle, rapid airflow past the signal hole, strong vacuum signal.

Wide Open Throttle, slower airflow past the signal hole (as butterfly is
not restricting the flow area), moderate vacuum signal.

Whether the &quot;moderate&quot; signal is enough to keep full advance in I do not
know.
