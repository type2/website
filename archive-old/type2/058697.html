Adam,
        For some mysterious reason, parallel wiring of two batteries does
some mysterious stuff.  It seems the lower charged battery pulls from the
other, then vice versa until they both pull each other down.  I am sure
there is an electrical engineer-type out there that has a good explanation
of this phenomenon.

        You could order an isolator from JCWipme for about $20 bucks.  It
is easy to hook up and you could do it yourself.  I did this and it worked
great for about a year until it burnt out and stopped passing a full charge
onto the batteries.  A listee from the UK said that he had similar
experiences until he paid top dollar for a heavy duty isolator.  As with
all electrical equipment, it seems we always go back to the &quot;you pay for
what  you get&quot; motto.

        Listee, David Schwarze, is the real gadget guru on the list.  He
recommends a relay-type system for charging two batteries.  I would check
with him directly for his opinion on the different supplemental charging
systems available.  Request that he post his notes to the list so we can
get this info added to the TYPE2.COM resource Library as this has been a
pretty hot topic for us camperers.
