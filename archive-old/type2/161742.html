Subject: RE: [T2] Subject: Small cracks in heads

&gt; last time i heard:&gt; &gt; any cracks = buy new headI know in the Bentley for the
VW Corrado it clearly states small cracks are acceptable and it gives some
specs on what the should be within.

I can't remember if it states in same in the bus Bentley but the price of new
type 4 heads would probably make me think twice about if I could run some with
small cracks.

If money is no problem then of course, buy new heads!!!
