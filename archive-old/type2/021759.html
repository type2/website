Subject: Re: [T2] Westfalia Epilepsy

For the brake vacuum line, there's a hard hose that comes through the
firewall on the driver's side of the engine compartment and makes a
90degree turn towards the intake manifold and then hooks up to the
manifold.  This piping is hard, not soft like rubber tubing.  Make sure
it isn't leaking anywhere because then you'll get incorrect FI readings,
not to mention dirty air.

I'd make sure that &quot;S&quot; tube is AIRTIGHT!  Any leakage from that tube
would again cause incorrect readings for the AFM (bad).  Next, make sure
all vacuum lines are hooked up and not leaking.  Spend the 6 bux and buy
all new vacuum lines to replace the ones that run to the distributor,
air filter (if you have that one), decel valve, fuel pressure regulator,
retard line (if you have it) and any others in case I forgot.  Make sure
that the vacuum advance that's hooked up to the throttle body is hooked
up to the advance side of the distributor vacuum can.

also make sure that the big hoses that go to the decel valve, aux air
valve, and the other one( can remember where it goes) are all snug and
airtight.

Next, make sure your timing is correct and steady and not hopping all
over the place.  Make sure it's also advancing correctly.

check the fuel pressure, both with the vacuum line on and off.

Check you compression... check your valves (they do need adjusting every
now and then -- couldn't hurt and very easy to do)

that's about all I can think of now... just make sure those air leaks
are fixed!  and also make sure you're not sucking duct tape into the
engine!!!

&gt; Volks,
&gt; 
&gt; 78 Westy 2.0l F.I.:
&gt; 
&gt; Replaced my calipers today, and subsequently rediscovered the serenity of
&gt; smooth, silent braking.  Just after the operation, I took it for a _at_10 mile
&gt; test ride, lotsa braking from 25-35 and some good downhill - all without
&gt; **any** problems.  I additionally sealed a crack in the air
&gt; cleaner&lt;--&gt;intake distributor boot with weather stripping and duct tape
&gt; (BusDepot doesn't carry the part - anyone have a lead??), and patched two
&gt; small chip-holes I discovered in the air cleaner with squares of duct tape.
&gt; Also replaced the air filter.
&gt; 
&gt; Upon return, I scrubbed, showered and dressed for a dinner trip with my
&gt; wife; destination about 20 miles.  On our trip, Petunia put a stake in my
&gt; heart with the following symptoms:
&gt; 
&gt; - Lurching, misfiring, **something** _at_ low-to-medium RPM in every gear.  At
&gt; lower speeds, e.g. say the typical RPM at shift from 1st to 2nd, and 2nd to
&gt; 3rd, the shaking, or 'lurching', was nearly violent.  Taking 2nd high into
&gt; the RPM band before shifting to 3rd had some effect, taking 3rd high before
&gt; 4th was slightly better - as the shaking became less violent.  Taking 3rd to
&gt; _at_ 50mph **generally** resolved the shaking (on the umpteenth try), but the
&gt; moment I put it into 4th, again with the seizures.  Subsequently, I drove
&gt; home in 3rd, as it was unbearable to try accelerating through the shaking in
&gt; 4th.  There seemed to be no clear rhyme or reason as to why she'd suddenly
&gt; cough her way out of the problem.  It is definitely **not** a
&gt; clutch/transmission problem, as listening to the engine during and after
&gt; these seizures revealed a &quot;suffocated&quot; sound - not enough noise back there,
&gt; ya know?  Like it wasn't firing on all cylinders?? During one particularly
&gt; bad episode, I pulled to the roadside to permit a line of followers to pass,
&gt; ran to the back and toyed with the throttle.  On some accelarations it would
&gt; do the same, sputter about and almost die, on others it sounded fine.
&gt; - Decrease in idle/wants to die if I pump the brakes at a standstill, in
&gt; neutral.  This sounds like a vacuum thing, but I honestly don't understand
&gt; how the vacuum system works vis a vis the brake system.  I couldn't even
&gt; find the appropriate vacuum hose in the engine compartment - don't know
&gt; where to look.  I do know that at high speeds, the brakes start biting
&gt; sooner in the depression, and later at lower - but beyond that, I'm in the
&gt; dark.
&gt; 
&gt; Now: (1) Can there be any way that these problems are related?  (2) Is the
&gt; sputtering problem definitely a fuel issue, e.g. suddenly clogged fuel
&gt; filter, or jacked-up fuel pump?  (3) Where do I find the vacuum for the
&gt; brake servo? (4) Anything else I'm missing?
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry for the verbosity, but I wanted to provide as much detail as possible.
&gt; Help!!
