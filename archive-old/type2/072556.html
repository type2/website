I have had many calls and emails from people giving me thier condolences.  Thank you all for the wonderful support!  Many of you have asked how they could help out the family, and if there is anything we need done.  The funeral has passed, and we have plenty of food.  What we are asking is that if you would like to do something, that you donate to the scholarship fund that we have set up in Jonathans name. This scholarship will be donated to a senior at his high school every year for as long as possible.  If you would like to send a donation, the information is listed below.  Thank you to all of my VW list family for helping me through this tough time!
