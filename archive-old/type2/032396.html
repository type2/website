Happy Friday All!
This is a Friday-ish posting.  I collect old magazine advertisements for VW buses (mostly from ebay).  I once saw an ad somewhere (can't remember where) that I MUST HAVE!!  Maybe some of you all could help a brother out and direct me to somewhere I might find this particular ad (sorry for the terrible grammar, but i have a degree in Physical Education!!)  Anyway, I will describe the ad as follows:  Pretty sure it was an ad for a 1976 Campmobile.  It showed a camper in the woods with the pop-top up and the caption at the bottom read &quot;HOME IS WHERE THE BUS IS.&quot;  Anybody have any ideas where I might look???  I continue to follow ebay, but it seems they mostly just list the same old ads over and over, which I already have most of these.  Anyway, just thought I'd take a Friday priviledge and ask.
Peace, John Baker
