Subject: 78 westy...auto tranny...stumped!

---------------------------------
      o.k....I'll do my best to explain this and see if anyone out there can help  I have a automatic 78 westy with a weber progressive carburetor. Transmission has worked great since I've owned her. Just had to have engine rebuilt and when I was cleaning the engine compartment I accidentally got water in the transmission fluid (aaahhh!!!) I've had the fluid changed out twice now and I'm still having major problems, here they are..... Drive works great! &quot;D2&quot; works great! &quot;D1&quot; and Reverse....help! When I put the bus in reverse it makes a &quot;clunk&quot; sound and if I put my foot on the gas it will go backwards, but feels as though a really strong e-brake is on...like it's straining against itself...it does the same thing in &quot;D1&quot;. Like I said, it works in drive, however, I drove it about 15 miles, it started smoking like crazy and I smelled tranny fluid and when I parked her, tranny fluid was coming out in a stream from what appeared to be where the torque converter is...tranny
 fluid was basically sprayed everywhere and dripping from a lot of places...not good  Could this all be caused by water in the fluid??? Is there any way to fix this or am I looking at swapping out my transmission? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! 
Thanks!
