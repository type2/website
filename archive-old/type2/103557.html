Subject: svda

I was reading an article posted on the web about bosch 009 distributors in 
stock 1600. I am having problems getting a good idle and clean exhaust smell. 
According to the article it suggests either an original vacuum advance or to 
get an SVDA from aircooled. Any suggestions on this matter. Thanks Dylan.
