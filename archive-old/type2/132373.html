&gt; Hello Richard    Only number 2&amp;3  are correct.

Let me elaborate because I didn't provide carved in stone rules.

&gt; First off the large chain
&gt; stores cause more problems and rip offs. This is mostly true with tire and
&gt; brake,muffler places.

In my limited experience, if the shop is specialized like a tiny alignment
only shop they have no incentive for you to come back for more expensive
service later if they've scrwed you.

&gt; Shop recommendations mean everything coming from the
&gt; right 
&gt; source.

It's still no guarantee. The right source is only yourself having been to
that shop before and it's still possible for future screwups to occur.
