Subject: Re: [T2] my dilemma

When faced with these decisions it is best to flip a coin. 
Decide which is heads and which is tails. If when the coin 
hits the ground you want to change the procedure to two out 
of three you have made your choice.

Thanks,
Chris

&gt;To: &lt;type2_at_pon.type2_dot_com&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Hey everybody,
&gt;
&gt;I have a dilemma that I'd love to hear some opinions about.
&gt;
&gt;I currently have:
&gt;
&gt;-73 sunroof bus - decent shape, pretty straight, strong 
engine, everything
&gt;works well
&gt;
&gt;-71 westfalia - newly rebuilt 1600 engine, very rough 
interior (PO's dog
&gt;chewed everything up) except the cabinets are still nice, 
needs steering and
&gt;brake piston repairs.
&gt;
&gt;-complete riviera poptop including excellent canvas
&gt;
&gt;-a wife and 2 young children who want to go camping.
&gt;
&gt;-$500 worth of parts from a local boneyard in exchange for 
helping him sell
&gt;a 87 westfalia quickly ($8500 steal if anyone is interested).
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I'd love to keep both vehicles, but finances require that I 
keep only one.
&gt;The riviera poptop would provide better sleeping 
arrangements for the family
&gt;than the westfalia poptop.
&gt;
&gt;The options I'm considering are:
&gt;
&gt;-keep the '71 and replace the existing poptop with the 
riviera poptop.
&gt;-keep the '73 and convert it to a &quot;west-viera&quot;.
&gt;
&gt;I need to be able to sell the remaining vehicle for more 
rather than less.
&gt;
&gt;Any thoughts?  Obviously there are mechanical differences 
between the
&gt;vehicles to take into account as well.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;
&gt;Brian
&gt;
