Subject: Parts cleanout -- wiper stuff, lenses, heater cables, Westy hinges, driveshafts

(If any Vintage listmember would be kind enough to forward this on, I'd 
appreciate it. There is some split bus stuff in here.)

Time to clean out the closet:

1 late split/early bay tail light lens (oval), no cracks

3 silver frames for above lens

1 pair replacement visor clips for bay windows

1 original German wiper switch (fits Bug 68-71, Bus 68-72, Ghia 68-71, Type 
3 68-71)

1 pair of heater cables for '55-'67 bus (5175 mm)

1 6V wiper motor for buses before '65, orginal SWF German, most linkage 
parts included, have not tested, probably a project

1 set of front bumper step pads for '68-'71 bus

1 complete set of Westfalia hinges and supports for early style ('68-'74?) 
poptop. One hinge has a welded section; everything is straight and 
functions.

1 set of driveshafts (2) and CV joints (4), used, mileage unknown, removed 
from bus when purchased last year, boots in good shape, bagged for storage, 
will fit any bus with IRS ('68-79)


They say one man's stash is another man's pleasure, or something like that. 
Make an offer on any of it.


Thanks,
