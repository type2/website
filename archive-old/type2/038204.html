Subject: Re: pushrods?

In the process od buying a '79 bus for parts for my 78. Will be parting out a
lot of stuff off the 79. Also have two a/c units if anyone is interested.

Chris


&gt; Anyone on the list parting out a type IV engine
&gt; that could sell/give me a few hydraulic pushrods?
&gt; There for a 79 engine.
&gt; I would prefer not to buy new, to save some bread :)
