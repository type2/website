&gt;    Can anyone recommend a mail order site for an oil galley plug for a 79

&gt;Any installation tips welcome.  Thanks   Mimi Cantwell

Only way to plug these are to tap em for 1/4 or 3/8 normal pipe and
use a socket head pipe plug.  All T4 galley locations can be tapped
and this done, but those and others are tough to do.  Depending which
you mean, I'm guessing that one is 3/8&quot;.  It is a very invasive job to do
some of those around the oil cooler and relief valve, and requires you to
grind your reamer and tap short enough to tap the shallow holes.

Anything push in is going to fail again.

Sorry to say it but,  do it right or scrap the case.

John
