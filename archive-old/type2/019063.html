I arrived home at about midnight my time. I had to fill my roommate in
on my adventures, and now I can send off a quick note to y'all before I
get some sleep.

I just want to say a big THANKS! to everyone for their support and good
wishes for my trip home after I hit that deer on I-10 in Texas last
Thursday night. You've made me, and my parents especially, very happy.
What could have been a potential disaster has been elevated to the realm
of adventure. My bus did fine on the way home, and we've arrived safely.

Unfortunately, many people seem to perceive the road as hostile to women
-- I got a lot of this: &quot;You traveling alone?! You have a boyfriend or
husband? You sure are brave!&quot; Yes, no, not really. In a perfect world,
it would be a non-issue.

Thank you, Art Lynch, for making the world a safer place for mothers,
sisters, wives, and daughters. If anyone happened to wonder just why Art
would go to all this effort for li'l ol' me, I think it may have
something to do with the fact that he's got two college-age daughters
and would want them to get the same good treatment were they in my
situation. Plus, he's just a decent guy and would do the same for
anyone.

I had a great vacation! It was a big adventure, I loooooved Texas
(people wave at you on the road!), and I wanna do it again next year --
minus the deer part, of course. Maybe then I'll have the time to meet
David Hunt, Bob Perring, and Seth Avant. If they're half as nice as
Craig K., Mike Gensler, Art Lynch, and David C., it'll totally be worth
the detour. Mike let me drive the über-bus -- it was cool, huh-huh,
huh-huh.

Now I know how to do a valve adjustment (yes, it took 3.5 hours!), and
I'm motivated to learn to do more of my own bus maintenance. If ya want
something done right.... I was getting 20 mpg on the way home, go
figure. I checked my math three times on two separate fill-ups, and it
works out.... &lt;baffled look&gt;

Valve cover gaskets go on my list of spares. There were none to be had
in San Angelo. Also, I'm really glad I had an air compressor. I found
out I'd picked up a nail in my tire when I went to remove the left valve
cover. After I finished the valve adjustment, I just filled up that
(flat) tire and had it repaired at the closest Firestone place. No
problemo. And a real boon since I couldn't find a rim to replace the
spare that disappeared along with the deer. (David Schwarze has a line
on a spare for me already.)

So, Joshua Tree, November 13-14. We'll be there! Not as pretty as
before, but stronger and wiser. Yeah! Looking forward to it. I'm really
looking forward to meeting yet more Listees -- I'm thinkin' they're the
greatest volks in the world.

Nikki
