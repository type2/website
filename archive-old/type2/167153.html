Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Depot's Spacemaker Tent

I would like to see how they hook up in the flesh.
Being that we camp continuously in the summer our main
concern with a tent would be how good it hooks up
due to mosquitos and blackflies getting into the bus.

Anyone know how tents are in that regard?

I don't own one but I have seen one &quot;in the flesh&quot; and they look very well
put together.  For what you get, I think it's a very good price.  These have
been designed specifically for VW buses.
