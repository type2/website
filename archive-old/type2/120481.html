Subject: '69 and a '71 bus comparison !

I sold my bus and could kick myself silly ! it was a
'70 rust free.

In a month or so once i move and get resituated I'll
be in the market for another bus.

I like the upright motor scene so im considering
'68-71. I had the '70 and it had a couple one year
only items such as the fuse box. So i may vere away
from that year.

I would like a '69 since its the year i was born, but
I just wanted to know are there any one year only
parts?

I like the '71 for its disc brakes, are there any one
year only items?

Please help with your comments regarding the '69 bus
vs the 71 which would be a more sound buy for the
ultimate long haul of life, as this will be my daily
driver of over 60miles a day..

TIA,
