Subject: Re: [T2] 75 FI bus finally starts-4 blocked injectors and mouse
  nests!

In 20/20 HS you have to reason if one clogs why not all?

BTW it sounds like you have a input air leak. New injector seals (1 large &amp; 
1 small) are a must. Torque retainer nuts to 60 cmkg (52 in lbs).

From your questions it also sounds like you are tackling this job without a 
Bentley manual.
