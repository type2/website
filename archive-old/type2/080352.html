Subject: Re: [T2] late Vanagon bed in a Bay Window?

I assume you mean the westfalia-made rear seat z-bed,
the style with storage (and a rear heater) underneath
and a mattress for the rear deck.  These were in early
weekender, Carat packages, and in most of the later
vanagons.  This seat would be too wide for a straight
swap.  

Think somebody mentioned cutting the width a little
and installing it in a loaf.  The rear deck height on
a loaf is taller (from the middle floor section) than
a vanagon.  So you might have to increase the height
of the seat portion someway (either a taller cargo box
section or raising the whole box by a few inches).  

The vanagon bench/bed combo is merely bolted to the
body in six places as I recall.  Four are in the
corners of the cargo box section below the seat. 
Another two are on the rear deck.  Assuming you got
the width and heigth correct, drilling and bolted
would seem to be easy enough.

If you are talking the folding rear seat out of the
more plain jane vanagon (still plush by loaf
standards), you'd have even more problems.  The
vanagon has a large bolt on which the upper portion of
the seat attaches when the seat is in the upright
position.  You'd have the same width and height
problem with this seat PLUS the need to weld an
attachment point for the vertical part of the seat. 
This seat, when folded forward, does not have the rear
cushion and isn't long enough (front to rear) to be a
comfortable bed.  

Good luck,
Ray

&gt; Hello List,
&gt; 
&gt; I was wondering if any of you knew if the back bench
&gt; seat/bed from a late model vanagon would fit into a
&gt; bay bus. I have the opportunity to purchase one
&gt; locally for cheep. Thanks!
