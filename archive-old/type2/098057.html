&gt; The plastic ones seemed to move pretty
&gt; easily so you can line up the holes with the
&gt; allignment screw, but the new copper bushing now in
&gt; there will not budge to line up with the allignment
&gt; screw.  Any ideas on how to make this thing move
&gt; around?  thanks

_Don't_ bang around on it with a punch or hammer!  You'll mushroom the
ends making the problem worse.

Use a wooden or plastic drift to move it around with hammer taps.  You
might also get hold of it with a small set of water pump pliars
(channelocks).
