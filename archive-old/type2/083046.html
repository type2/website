Subject: RE: Am I sitting on a bulkhead bomb?

I will give all I know...
I have my boyfriend's 68 for reference and had a 70,
both Westies.  The 68 does not have the bulkhead
seperating the gas tank from the engine compartment,
while my 70 did.  The 70 I owned was built in
September of 1969...
  I hope this helps if you are interested... if not
just ignore.
