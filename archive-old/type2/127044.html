&gt; OK I just got a 78 FI standard 2 L engine and want
&gt; to put it in my 73.
&gt; 
&gt; It looks like everything came with the engine except
&gt; the brain for the FI
&gt; that is attached to engine.
&gt; 
&gt; What else might I need.

Snoopy,
Don't forget you will have to take the 73 flywheel and
put it on the 78 engine, otherwise, she no work with
the 73 tranny bell housing!
I put a 2.0 litre FI into a 72 that I sold a while
back and I just took the old Sawzall and cut a hole in
the place where the brain is supposed to be mounted,
slipped it in and screwed it down.
