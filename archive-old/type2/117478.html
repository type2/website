great!

&gt; What I'd like to hear about are ways you all keep your camper organized

?????ORGANIZED??????? huh, what's that?

&gt; How about mosquitos? We have the rear screen, and I know a sliding door
&gt; screen is available, but it's a little pricey if I recall correctly . Have
&gt; any of you thrifty people come up with a cheaper alternative? How about the
&gt; front windows?

I have some pieces of screen materiel that is cut about an inch larger all
the way round than the front windows, hold the screen up against the
inside of the windows with magnets..you can get a roll of magnetic
material and just stick it on the screen. fast and easy.
  still haven't done anything about the door, in a past life I had the
door screen and it was more trouble than it was worth YMMV

&gt; Outside. We have a largish pavillion type of thing with a roof and no sides
&gt; which folds up nicely. It's nice for sunny days, however, it's worthless in
&gt; the rain. The rain splashes in, and if we set it up right outside the
&gt; sliding door the rain pours off the roof and gets the inside of the open
&gt; door wet- I know, close the door, but it's nice to have it open. I'm going
&gt; to get a tarp to bridge the gap- any other cheap alternatives?

I have a cheap plastic like tarp 12X16 if I recall, attach one of the 12
ft ends to the driver side of the bus, throw it over the bus and pull it
off on the other end, gives a nice 12X10ft area or so in front of the door
and nothing gets into the bus...fast, easy, simple the tarp was about $15
bucks at Home Depot and maybe a few dollars for the bungee cords that hold
it on/up   

&gt; Rain- what do you all do in the rain?

get wet ;8*{

&gt; have to take our shoes off to keep the inside clean/dry. Any suggestions for
&gt; camping in the rain? PA has had an exceptionally wet summer this year.

Maryland was pretty damp too, it's gonna rain on a camping trip, required
by the campers code, so you either fight it or roll with it, gave up
fighting a long time ago.  bring lots of towels, get wet, dry
off.....repeat as needed
