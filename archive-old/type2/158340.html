&gt; Chris,
&gt; Did you try contacting Bus Depot before posting this message?  Not
&gt; everyone gets everything perfect on the first time.  I hope you're not
&gt; trying to put down Bus Depot as we are more than grateful to have them
&gt; around.  Everyone is human - if you haven't already, give them a chance
&gt; to rectify the problem before you complain to the list.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks!

You could try my local VW dealership (Essex Sportscars, nee Maplewood
Air Cooled) and ask the service and parts department. But I wouldn't
really recommend it since they have a policy of not looking up any-
thing over fifteen years old....;-(
