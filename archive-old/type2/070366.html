Subject: Re: Brake bleeding Process

A simple self-help, no burp, hydraulic brake bleeder gadget looks like 
an I.V. (introvenious) bag. The bag is hung higher than the wheel 
cylinder(s) with a wire or string.  A small transparent tube moulded 
into the bottom of the bag is pushed onto the bleed nipple.  As long as 
the master cylinder reservoir is kept full and the I.V. bag is kept 
high, entrained air bubbles rise into the bag along with the dirty 
fluid during the bleeding process.
