Subject: [T2] 1 5/8&quot; piped heater boxes ???

Anyone remember, or know someone, that makes SS 1 5/8&quot; (or larger) piped 
&quot;stock locking&quot; heater boxes for a 71 Westy...

I need the performance of the larger pipe going throught them, and will not 
live without the heat, so header pipes are not an option.

I remember seeing them produced somewhere... or if there is a handy man out 
there that could do this... here is your first customer.

Mykl and
Rusty (71 Westfalia)
