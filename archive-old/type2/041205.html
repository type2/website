Subject:  Admin - subject line rules?

can we make some kind of rule similar to the vintage bus list [VB], where we
put something in the subject line of the message like [T2] so that it is
easier to sort the messages?
some people are using nicknames or cc: for thier messages and they end up in
my general mailbox.
