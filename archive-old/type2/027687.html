I am not sure how many miles the engine has on it. From running the numbers,
it was purchased &quot;over the counter&quot;. I have measured the rod side clearance
as best I could without splitting the case, and they are all well within
spec. I have sent an e-mail to Boston Engine, to see if they sell short
blocks, since I already have new heads, P&amp;C's, etc..... This list has been a
great education. The only problem is I now know too much. It was learning
how important it is to have the engine compartment sealed well that led me
to pull the motor to replace the front (FIF) engine tin with the correct, 71
only piece, which led to seeing that the top tin needed replacing, which led
to seeing the hole in the exhaust, which led to pulling the heads to get
stripped exhaust studs replaced, which led to seeing the cracks in the heads
and buying new ones along with new P&amp;C's. If I had only remained ignorant, I
would be driving the bus already (or at least having it towed from the spot
it died at.....LOL)

The question is, how many miles/hours has this motor been run? 

If, however, this is a high milage motor that has developed wear beyond
spec, it's long block time. 

Excess end play means every time you use the clutch, the crankshaft slips
back and forth. This misaligns the rods too much if the end play spec is
too much. The rod bearings wear excessively at their edges. Excessive end
play in new assemblies is the root of many 20k- life motors. 

Gee, if I spend twice as much for a 100k motor than I do for a 20k motor,
am I fool for value or what???
