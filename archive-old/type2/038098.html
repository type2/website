Subject: Need thermostat for 34 PDSIT 2/3

The male connector on my right carburetor (73 Bus) broke during the time of 
the PO. They soldered the wire on, but it only works a while then the 
vibration works it loose. Does anyone have a working out housing with that on 
that I can obtain. 

Thanks

Tom
