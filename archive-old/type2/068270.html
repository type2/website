Subject: VIN info from Volkswagen/M Codes?

Volks,

I received a letter from Volkswagen AG today. They answered my query 
about my bug and my bus. Here's what they said:

VIN:             5 019 076
Model:           VW-Sedan
Engine No.:      7 120 274
Color:           White
Production Date: October 5th, 1962  &lt;-- this is cool, cause it's my 
birthday too!
Delivery Date:   October 8th, 1962
Delivered to:    Giessen - Germany

VIN:             266 2 116 441
Model:           VW Type II Double Cab
Engine No.:      AS 3 87 854
Color:           Green
Production Date: not registered
Delivery Date:   March 3rd, 1976
Delivered to:    Netherlands

Unfortunately, they weren't able to provide any information regarding the 
m-codes I sent them. So, I'm still looking for a good source on m-codes. 
Let me know if you know of something.

Should anyone care to get information on their car, you may request 
information from:

Pre 1955 vehicles: 
VW Brezelffenstervereinigung e.V.
    Ernst Peter Hagen
    Amselweg 4, D-
    3073 Liebenau
    GERMANY

and for all other VWs:
    Kundendienst / Customer Assistance
    VOLKSWAGEN AG
    D-38436 Wolfsburg
    GERMANY

&quot;Brezelffenstrevereinigung&quot; means Pretzel Window Club and refers to the 
fact that the Beetle's early rear window looks like a European Pretzel.

cheers,

Bren
