First off- Is this the one year only true '68 002 with
the bolt on side cover flanges or has the later style
screw in sidecover trans been retrofitted??

Normally there should not be any axial play with
the CV flange and the differential.  They do ride on
splines but the snap ring under the seal in the
middle of the flange should secure it.  A * very* 
slight side to side (backlash) rocking movement 
between the flange and diff splines is OK but it
should not be able to move in and out of the trans.

Given the age of the trans it wouldn't surprise me
if someone else has got in there before you and 
may have left the small split thrust ring from under
the flange, where it butts up against the differential
inside the transaxle, off.  If they did leave it off it
should give about a fat 1/16th of an inch movement
in and out.
