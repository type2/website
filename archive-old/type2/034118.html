Subject: Re: Installing FI system

Ed, I did something like this to my '72; that is, I installed a '77 FI
engine. You *will* need the fuel tank and I'd recommend getting a good one
from a FI bus, since the modification would require welding and that can be
either expensive or dangerous on a tank that's had gas in it.

You will also need a wiring harness for the fuel injection. It will hook
into your normal harness. I don't *think* there are additional mods, but I
honestly don't remember. If there are, they are minor.

I think there may be a slight difference in the tinware because of the fuel
pump, but since you're not switching engines, that should be no problem for
you...just keep the fuel pump connected and keep your tinware as is.

I actually just bought another engine 1800 w/fuel pump because I'm going to
have to pull the 2.0 for deep work. I elected to go with a mechanical fuel
pump because of the versatility it affords me (read, quick recovery from
on-the-road problem with FI if parts aren't available).

Oh, one more thing you'll have to do/figure is what to do about the EGR
valve. I plugged mine, but I don't think I can get a perfect adjustment to
the fuel mixture like this.

Also, you need a temp sensor on one of your heads and I don't think your
heads have that stock. You also need some ground connectors on the engine,
but this is minor stuff and maybe you can pull these when you pull the FI
system.

Oh, and you'll have to figure out where/how to mount all the FI stuff--AFM,
brain, double relay, series resistor, pressure regulator, etc. I didn't
mount mine in standard locations because I've never seen a FI bus engine
compartment. I found where it would fit and put it there. There are some
concerns with doing this, as my brain may be getting hotter than it ought
to, etc.

Can't think of anything else....but come to think of it, this is not a
trivial task after all. In the end, you'll probably be happier with
performance though. FI is better if it's right; worse if it's broken. MHO;
YMMV.

Have fun! Joe

&gt;I am looking to convert my 74, 1800cc stock dual solex setup to a fuel
injection system from a 79 non-California and was wondering if anyone has
any experience on doing this.  Basically, what components will need to be
replaced?
