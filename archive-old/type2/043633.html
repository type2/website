Subject: RE: Plaids for campers

&gt; &gt; For example, in 1976-77 if you wanted a poptop Westy with no stove,
&gt; &gt; you got a chrome yellow camper with yellow/green plaid. If you
&gt; &gt; wanted a model with a stove (and other &quot;extras&quot; such as front table,
&gt; &gt; trash recepticle, and electric fridge) you got a sage green camper with
&gt; &gt; green plaid.

&gt; Then how did I get a 78 with no stove etc. but it's sage green? I
&gt; thought it wasn't a delux but still a popup.


Re-read my statement above.  This referred to '76-77.  You have a '78.  In
'78-79, only the non-deluxes (no stove) were sage green.  Deluxes were
either beige or 2-town brown/white (Champaigne Edition only).
