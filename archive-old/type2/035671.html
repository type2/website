&gt; one nut on each refuses to back out.

&gt; How much torque can I put on those? I really

&gt; Will an impact wrench bust it free if 3-400 ft lbs

Ok, you have some options. 

You can brute force it.  If you twist the stud
off, you just press it out of the hub and replace it.

You can employ the &quot;blue wrench&quot; (torch).  This often helps loosen
stubborn nut.  This might be contraindicated if you have a gas leak.

You can use a nut splitter (or educated use of a sharp chisel) on the
offending nut.  This will get it off without damaging the stud.

You can use the &quot;bathe it in Liquid Wrench (or Kroil, or whatever)&quot;
routine.  Regular soakings for several days.

Put a socket on the nut and give it a healthy rap with a hammer.  This
might loosen the threads.

Have Fun!
