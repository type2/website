Hi- yes, sounds too much, but you need to check underneath for more extensive 
rust..windows seals leaking? sounds like seat belt mounts and front wheel 
arches will need replacing. Difficult to say without seeing but a resto 
project would be 500-800 (or lower) pounds depending on state and 2500-3500 
for reasonable bus with interior for camping and good engine (with MOT). Body 
work is the most expensive repair and resprays are not cheap but not sure of 
the market in ireland..there are plenty of buses here so you can afford to be 
choosy. Engines are relatively cheap for type 1 (500-900 pounds depending) so 
best to get as good a body as you can afford..cos that's were the money will 
go in the longer term..anyway-just my thoughts
