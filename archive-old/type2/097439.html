Subject: Re: stranded - Bad Starter? Help!

Yep I'm with John on this one. Classic symptoms of a stuck solenoid. I've
had 4 of these vehicles so far, and 3 out of the 4 had this happen. Heat
affects the starter/solenoid over time, so heating it is justing adding more
fuel to the fire. As John said, give it a nice  massage with a hammer, but
don't hit it hard enough to leave dents!! If it's gonna fix it, it will do
it after a couple of good whacks. If it is a standard just pop start it in
second gear with the ignition on and a couple of line-backers pushing. :-)
Then go out and buy a new starter, or have yours rebuilt, and consider
making some type of heat shield for it like GM finally had to do for their
similar problem in thier small block vehicles.
HTH,
Courtney
