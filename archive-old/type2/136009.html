Subject: Re: [T2] Official AIRS Update... Take 2

guys all this talk about where to host it and what to have it written
is somewhat moot. AIRS is kinda a pet project of the type2/vb list. We
already have a solid server and a way to pay for it's use (via
donations). The added complications of an additional server and ways
to pay for it seem over the top. Greg is the man in charge now and can
make that determination, but i'd guess that the added stress of
managing finance in addition to this quite large undertaking might be
a bit more than he counted on.
