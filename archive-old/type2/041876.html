&gt; Just wondering if there is a way to verify that the cam timing is in synch
&gt; with the distributor/crankshaft timing (not sure if I'm using the right
&gt; words here).

Yes.  It takes a couple of people, but by having one person turn the crank
(by hand) while another person watches the movement of the rocker arms, it's
possible to see if the crank/cam timing is correct.

&gt; I'm also wondering if it is possible to put the distributor
&gt; drive shaft in wrong (ie forcing me to rotate the distributor so it hits
&gt; things on the engine before my timing is right).

Yes.  As long as you can turn the distributor enough to compensate (i.e.,
get the ignition timing right) it's not a big deal to be off 1 tooth here.
If you can't get the ignition timing right then you've got to reset the
distributor drive shaft.
