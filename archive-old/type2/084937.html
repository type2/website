Subject: Re: [T2] Junk Vehicle Law

You sure those regulations didn't come from Russia by mistake???

Quite extreme IMHO.

At 08:45 AM 5/13/02 -0400, you wrote:
&gt;New York State law forbids the possession
&gt;of one (1) or more motor vehicles which are
&gt;unlicensed, unregistered, or uninsured or
&gt;any combination thereof.
&gt;These are considered &quot;junk&quot; regardless of the fact
&gt;that they have a value in excess of scrap metal.
&gt;The same law forbids possession of parts or
&gt;materials stored in open areas of premises.
&gt;Some communities have taken this a step further,
&gt;to include legal vehicles ( properly lisenced, registered
&gt;and insured ) temporarily disabled at a residence.
&gt;This would include a vehicle on jack stands for the
&gt;purpose of changing a tire.
&gt;
&gt;Exceptions include vehicles displayed at licensed
&gt;repair shops for the purpose of repair or liscensed
&gt;dealer or wholesaler lots for the purpose of sale.
&gt;Lisenced junk yards are also exempt.
&gt;Also exempted are those vehicles stored in a building.
&gt;Car covers and tarps do not satisfy this exemption.
&gt;
&gt;There are no legal collectors of vehicles
&gt;who do not satisfy these regulations.
&gt;
&gt;According to New York State Executive Law
&gt;section 382(2) you can be fined up to $1000
&gt;per violation per day and imprisoned up to
&gt;1 year or both.
&gt;
&gt;I am currently considering my options
&gt;regarding &quot;alledged&quot; violations of this law,
&gt;both to satisfy the authorities and to allow for
&gt;the continuation of my activities.
&gt;
&gt;Any advice will be appreciated.
