Subject: [T2] Big Bend (FL) Bus Drivers

I'm taking a stab at forming a loose association of bus enthusiasts in
the Big Bend area of Florida.  Mainly email-based, with perhaps an
occasional campout, etc.  We're kinda halfway between the Peach State
Transporters and the Bulli Brigade, so maybe there's a geographical
niche.

If it sounds interesting to you, I've created an &quot;egroup&quot; and mailing
list at http://www.egroups_dot_com/group/bbbd.  Many of you are already
familiar with egroups -- but if you have any trouble getting on the list
please let me know.

Thanks &amp; have a great weekend!
