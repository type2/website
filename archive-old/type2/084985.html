Subject: Re: [T2] dellorto rebuild

Start looking for Fiat and Alfa Romeo catalogs.

They will have the kits that you need.

These carbs originally came on the Alfa Romeo Alfetta - late 70's, early 80's.

Maybe NAPA can even get these because you can tell them what car to look for.

At one time CB Performance carried alot of Dellorto stuff. I have a pair 
for 45 or 46 mm side draft Dellortos I'd love to trade for another pair of 
36mm Dell DRLA carbs if anyone wants them.

&gt;We have a pair of baby dells, not computers. 36mm dellortos and want to
&gt;rebuild them does anyone carry the kits at a good price. and has anyone done
&gt;any jet work for a 2000cc other than keeping them stock.
