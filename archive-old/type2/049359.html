Subject: [T2] Re: Bus list years

Jerry,

I am sorry, I just answered you off the type2 address and am checking my
&quot;spam&quot; address and see this question...

Jerry, *any* year bus is fine to post on a &quot;for sale&quot;!  50-99, all are
fine.  We tend to concentrate on the bays, of course, but I very much
encourage for sale posts, especially those like yours that are serial!!! I
would like, somewhat belately, to thank you, and Sean Bartnik, and John
Perry for the service that you are rendering!  I value &quot;for sale&quot; posts
highly.  The reason is not only to fill list members current desires at
the current time, but for reference in the future.

If your bus is involved in an accident, a reference of prices paid/asked
for a similar year bus go a long way toward a fair insurance settlement!
And a large database of &quot;for sale&quot; ads in the archives really help with
establishing that valuation!  Please, Jerry, continue!  and any bus that
you find is fine to post &quot;for sale&quot;, whatever the year. 

If anyone else who lives in a bus-rich area and wants to start a series
of &quot;for sales&quot; for their area, they are very welcome to do so!

                           H Steven Dolan

&gt; &gt; Jerry,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Well, the official line is '82.5.  Type2 covers air cooled buses from '68
&gt; &gt; thru the end of production is what I think the charter says, but we
&gt; &gt; discourage discussion of current production Brazilian buses, and I beat
&gt; &gt; anyone who mentions importing them into the US to death with a large carp!
&gt; &gt; Is that clear as mud? :-)
