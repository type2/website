Subject: Re: [T2] Email virus: Helvetica

Folks, the list charter specifies that message content is to be limited to
bus topics only.  We all know what a virus is and what to do about them.

Apparently a listee has acquired a virus that is using his address book to
propagate itself under many different userids.  The messages are not
coming from the list, period.
