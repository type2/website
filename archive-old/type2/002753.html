Greetings..

I'm curious to know what type of atmospheric science occurs inside an engine
at different operating speeds :).  For instance (and this may be related to
oil pressure as well), during acceleration or idle, there seems to be a
consistent pressure inside the crankcase.

But when overrevving the engine (coasting down a hill in gear, or
downshifting when coming to a stop) what happens?  Does pressure increase
solely based on rpms?

I guess my questions is: physically, are conditions different inside the
engine when driving at high rpms (cruising along at 60:)) vs overrevving the
engine?

I ask this because I seem to be getting some oil blowby and a strong burning
oil smell whenever the engine (once warm) overrevvs.  I don't smell this
when I'm driving along the highway, but rather when I'm coming to a stop and
downshifting.  It seems like overrevving increases the pressure or somehow
reverses the pressure in the crankcase which is causing oil to leak when it
normally does not do so.  I believe the leak is at the base of the generator
stand and blows onto the hot intake manifold, burning, and being forced up
to me in front.  Yes, the smell is much stronger when the heat is on.  I
know if I fixed the leak, the problem would go away, but that's not my
question.

Any thoughts or descriptions of these processes inside the case?

Cheers,
