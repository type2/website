Subject: Re: [T2] 412 motor in a 75 bus

I think you have a good thing going the 412 engine
should take the 75 bus engine tin and flywheel. The
rear (wing) mounts will have to be changed over to the
Bus one, I think the heater boxes and exhaust could be
used but you will have to use the bus intake manifold.
The easy way would be to strip the t-4 and load it
with the bus exterior parts. Phil
