&gt; Has anyone ever gone over the boarder and bought a longblock. I do not know

I went to Germany and shipped my car over, put in the engine while there
and then shipped it back to the USA installed in the car.  I would suspect
it would be a LOT easier if you put the engine in while in Mexico, doubt
if they inspect the serial numbers on the engines when you cross the
border, and besides just tell em you broke down and had to get it fixed
while there.  if neccesary put a junker engine in for the trip down
