Subject: Re: [T2] TRW Steering Box

Thank you George.

This brings me right back to my original question:  Why doesn't anybody make 
a repro steering unit for our early bays?  They could even update it from a 
peg to a roller.  I assume VW upgraded the box for reliability.

No, the later box uses different mounting holes and the &amp;quot;neck&amp;quot; is larger,
so it won't fit on an early Bay.  This has been discussed before and the
consensus is that modifying to allow use of a later box is prohibative.

Makes me be very gentle to my existing box!

George
