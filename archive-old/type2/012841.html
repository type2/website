Hi List:

Has anyone out there tried the Mallory Unilite distributors for the type 1 engine?  It sounds pretty good.  The advance curve can be adjusted with an optional spring kit, and has more total advance than a 009.  It's a little pricey, so I want to get some feedback from people I trust before I buy one.

Thanks,
