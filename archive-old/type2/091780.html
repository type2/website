Subject: Just a Couple of Questions

Just a couple of questions concerning our 75 bus.
 
1) At what location do I connect a vacuum gage and what should the vacuum
be?
 
2) My compression gage is the screw in type with a hose 12&quot; attached to the
gage.  The problem is the fitting goes all the way into the motor sheet
metal and I am afraid that if I screw it in by turning the hose, I will not
be able to get it back out.  Is there a trick to this or a better type gage
to use?
 
3) I want to be able to listen to the radio when the motor is off but have
read on the list that the points may weld together if they happen to be in
the wrong position.  How can I avoid this, I have a 0231 181 012
distributor.  Can I use a breakerless system in this distributor, if so is
there more than one brand and which is best and why?
 
4) For the first ten minutes of driving or so when I come to a stop the bus
doesn't want to idle and dies.  It starts right back up but why wont it
idle?
 
 
Thanks 
Don Miller
