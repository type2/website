Subject: [T2] Westfalia Child's Hammock -- Cot

&gt; Karl [aufever_at_prodigy_dot_net] p-mailed me some info that I think should be in
&gt; the archive.  I have edited it for clarity and key-worded the subject:
&gt; 
68 - 79 Westfalia Child's Hammock info:

*	The half-moon mounting brackets are the same from 68 to 79 -- 2
lefts and 2 rights.
&gt; *	68 to 73 bars are 56 1/4&quot; long.  68-73 were stored above the right
&gt; side cabinet.
*	Your 68 bars should be round and black.
*	Starting in 69, they were 3 sided galvanized steel -- much stronger.
The round ones bend very easily......
&gt; *	74 and up, the half-moons were moved lower on the posts.
&gt; *	From 74 you would need bars that are 57 1/4&quot; long.
&gt; *	74-75 bars are one piece and store below the full width bed/bench
&gt; seat.
&gt; *	76-79 bars are 2 piece collapsible. The reason is because of where
&gt; they are stored. The bed/bench seat is 3/4 width.
