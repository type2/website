Subject: Re: [T2] Swap for '72 owners manual

** From: john kolak &lt;jkolak_at_gmail_dot_com&gt;

** How about a 74 here?

Thanks for the info, John, but as someone else mentioned, the '73, '74, '75, 
'76, '77, [no '78] and '79 are STILL available NEW from Bentley for about$20 
+ shipping.  I called Bentley, and Jacque confirmed that they did not have 
the '72.

The 1872 is the really rare one, but I will settle for the 1972....
