&lt;&lt; Hi Volks,
 
 My mechanic can't get the steering wheel off my '70 bus and doesn't have
 a puller.
 
 Can anyone help us locate one in the Santa Monica/Los Angeles, Calif.
 area? &gt;&gt;

Harbor Freight sells a gear puller set for $40.  This set will pull just about
anything you'd care to pull.  It includes the clam shell type puller you need
to pop your steering wheel off.
  Peace, Love, and Santa is supposed to bring me one for Christmas-I've even
found a way to be naughty and nice at the same time!!
