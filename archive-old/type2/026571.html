&gt;I was wondering what year throttle cables will fit my 74 Bus
&gt;I have one that is 3650 mm long and would like to use it as a 
&gt;spare, no use carrying the wrong one, but I didn't want to pull 
&gt;the 74 out to check it's lenght I think this one came out of a 78

RMMW catalog shows the following for buses:

68-69 (to ch#219060788)     3670mm/144.49&quot;
69-71 (from ch#219060789)  3680mm/144.88&quot;
72         3700mm/145.67&quot;
73-74    3655mm/143.90&quot;
75-79    3458mm/136.14&quot;
