Subject: RE: [T2] 68-69 vin plate locations

The VIN is also stamped in the engine compartment, right side, in front of
the oil filter tower. You should have two riveted information plates, one
behind the pass seat (serial numbers), one behind the driver's seat
(m-codes) and a VIN sticker behind the driver's seat.

That doesn't mean there are some variations, especially in the 68-68 model
years.

&quot;Any list members have a 68-69 bus. I just bought one of each and the only
vin. plates I can find is behind the pass. seat. What year did they start &quot;
