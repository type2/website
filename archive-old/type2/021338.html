Subject: wiper shaft seals

I just repaired some very minor rust around my windshield. I now need to
find new seals to go around the shafts from that hold the wiper arms. I
tried to find something that would work at  the local hardware store
with no luck. Anyone
have a suggestion or source?

Thanks,
