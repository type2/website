Subject: wire diagrams &amp; siting

A while back I offered to make color photo copies of some color
wiring diagrams I had.  I ended up with two extra copies, one for
a 1970 and one for a 1971 bus.  Some of the people who sent me
money gave a little extra and said to put it to good use.  So, I
will give away the two extra copies I have to the first people to
respond.

This happened on Friday,
My bus and I made the Front Page of our local news paper.  We had
a huge traffic snarl.  I think I was stuck there for a good 10 or
15 minutes. Ha ha ha.   Notice the shiny front turn signal lens
that I just traded a piece of engine tin for from another list
member.   Check it out if you want to see it.
