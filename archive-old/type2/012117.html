To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Stuff to try:

1. Vise grips and a hammer - a lousy method, but
occasionally necessary

2. Cut a slot in the top of the bolt, and try using a
big screwdriver.

3. Take your chances with a torch and paraffin wax,
and then use vise grips and a hammer. 

4. Use a die grinder to grind the heads off the bolts,
and worry about how you're going to get the rest of
the bolt out later.

5. Panic.

&gt; Any tricks to getting those 2 nuts off if they are
&gt; stripping?  I'm leery to
&gt; use a torch to heat them up because of proximity of
&gt; fuel tank and lines.
&gt; Any advice would be greatly appreciated as these are
&gt; the last 2 bolts
&gt; required to take the tranny out.
