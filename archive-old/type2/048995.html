Okay. --KH]

  I have a 1975 VW Camper and a 1974 Transporter that I am giving away.
They are in need of some restoration.  I don't have the time or space to
work on them.  I hope you can find someone who is interested in them.  I
live in Weems, Virginia and my phone number is (804) 435-1289.  My
e-mail address will be changing as of December 1, 2000.   I don't have a
new one as of yet.  You can usually reach my by phone between
7:30-9:30pm eastern time.  Thanks Sam
