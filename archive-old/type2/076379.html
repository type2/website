Subject: [T2] Westy interior panel patterns

I've completed and checked patterns for the sliding door and rear hatch
panels.  These are based on my 71 Westy, and, I expect, will be applicable
for 68 thru 72, and possibly others as well.  So now I need someone to step
forward and provide space on their webpage to load these files so list
members can access them. Perhaps the Type2_dot_com page can accomodate this.
These pattern files are presently in AutoCad 2000 .dwg format, but I can
convert to AutoCad 14 .dwg and/or .dxf - whatever the consensus determines
to be the most desireable format.

Hal will be tracing additional panels and sending them to me in the future,
so, before too long I expect there will be a complete set of patterns
available.
