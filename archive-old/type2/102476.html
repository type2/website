Subject: Re: [T2] suspension

Source for those coilovers?  I've been looking for new front and rear
shocks, not having much success and haven't seen any coilovers so far.  TIA!

Tor
'71 Mystery Highroof &quot;Mo&quot;
'00 Cannondale &quot;Lefty&quot;

&gt; Add coilovers.  My '70 has them.  It adds a respectable amount of stifness
&gt; to the rearend.

&gt; &gt;Anybody know if/how I can stiffen the suspension on a Baywindow?
