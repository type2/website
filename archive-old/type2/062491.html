Subject: Hypoid oil

        I hate to disagree with Lessie in Alhambra but hypoid
oil is needed for more than just the final drive- our realtively
quiet transmission gears are are 'constant mesh' as opposed to
'straight cut'- I can't think of the word for this and the dictionary
is no help today. But the gears are cut in a curve that leaves them
engaged continuallly, and thus subjects the oil to *SHEARING*
action, not high heat.
