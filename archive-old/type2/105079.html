Subject: Re: [T2] rebuild and honing

&gt;How do you bring up all of these facts to your mechanic without feeling 
&gt;like you are insulting them, or without making them feel like your being 
&gt;overbearing? I don't know that either place would intentionally make 
&gt;someone feel this way, but typically, doesn't that feel like how ppl react 
&gt;when you question and question their practices, with the only thing to 
&gt;back you up is an online community? Many seem to write all of us off as do 
&gt;it yourselfers without a knowledge of what works and what doesnt when you 
&gt;do this day in and day out VS a few one time, at home tests.

Well I wouldn't worry to much about hurting his feelings. I'm not saying 
you should be rude but ask questions freely. If he can't answer the 
questions in a reasonable tone or with some reasonable answers that you can 
check out later you don't want to do business with them. My point is if he 
can't discuss this like an adult would you be able to rely on him or her if 
there was a warranty claim because the engine died?

Ask him your questions. Try to know something about what your asking, 
research his answers a bit to confirm the truth, ask about materials, 
tools, procedures.
