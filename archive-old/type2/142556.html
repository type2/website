You've determined that you're not getting power to it or that it's not injecting fuel?

&gt;I understand it only
&gt;works while the engine is cranking and will automatically shut off after 10
&gt;seconds. I assume these two protections against flooding are handled by the
&gt;central control unit.

The thermo time switch (TTS) controls how long:

The element will warm and reduce the cold start valve operation interval based on ambient temperature.

It's mounted on the engine like so:

The initial air temperature will govern how long it will initially operate. As the engine warms, the interval decreases because of the heat radiated from the case.

TTS is connected to terminal 86 of the double relay which is powered by Terminal 50 on the starter and/or ECU pin #4. See N17 and F26 at the very right of the diagram:
