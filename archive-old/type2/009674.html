Al Brase gave some good advise on carb cleaning.  I'd like to add one more 
thing.  When spraying carb cleaner in the passages please wear safety 
glasses or goggles.  I just finished rebuilding a 34 PICT 3.  I wasn't wearing 
glasses while cleaning the carb body.  Fortunately I was close to a sink and 
flushed the carb cleaner out of my eye before it caused any damage.
