Hi,

Glad to see that Ron is now willing to increase my credit card debt:)&gt;

However, my shopping cart keeps coming up empty after I enter quantities and
I tried the email link on his page but keep getting an error. Ron or someone
please help me before Michele realizes that I have the VISA card!
