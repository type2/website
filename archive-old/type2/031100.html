&gt; I am rebuilding a 2.0L 79' FI from my '79 nine passenger.  I am having

&gt; 1972-1979 Type-2) says to &quot;remove three bolts in center of fan and work
&gt; the fan off the engine...&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; It is not that easy... It seems that there is something else to this...
&gt; 
&gt; Anybody have more specific instructions...?

is engine out of the van?

the fan will come off, wiggle and pull, straight out.
