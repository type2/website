&gt; Hello list.  
&gt; I purchased new disk brake rotors for my '76 from Bus Depot, and got
&gt; ready to install them.  I was impressed by how much thicker they are
&gt; than the very worn ones that I had on my bus.  That is the problem. 
&gt; They are so thick that when I bolt on the new rotors, I can't get the
&gt; calipers to slide over the rotors so that the calipers line up with
&gt; their mounting holes.  I am confident that I've got the new rotors to
&gt; mate up flush with the hub, but it seems that I'm lacking 1/4 of an
&gt; inch of clearance.  This is not a result of the calipers being pushed
&gt; out -- it is the caliper frame that snags the rotor.  (Pads are not in
&gt; the calipers).  Any ideas?  I think I may have the wrong rotors, but I
&gt; measured their thickness, and they are 13 mm which Haynes says is the
&gt; right thickness, and the other dimensions look correct, though I can't
&gt; be sure.  The only thing that I can think of is that I didn't get the
&gt; wheel bearings back on all the way when I repacked them while I had
&gt; the rotors off, but I really don't think I've got both bearing sets on
&gt; wrong.
&gt; 
&gt; any suggestions are very appreciated.

Is it possible that you have somehow gotten early (71-72) spindles on
your late bus?  A long shot, but possible.

Pull the disks off and measure the distance from the mounting surface
(where the end of the hub bears on the disk hub) to the inner surface
of the disk.  Compare this measurement to the original disk.  If it's
more than a mm or two different then you've got the wrong disk for
your spindles.
