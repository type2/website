&gt; Open your engine lid and look at the big hoses going to your decel valve and
&gt; your aux air valve. One of them blew off. Reconnect it.

or possibly, your backfire has caused the air flow meter to jam.....take
off the air cleaner. look into the opening and you will see a flap.  take
a pencil eraser and push this flap it should move smoothly..  also check
the plug behind the air flow meter to see that it is installed tightly.


&gt; &gt; Hey everyone- came out of work Saturday morning and my 78 bus started
&gt; &gt; right up but then died.  Started it up again and the same thing
&gt; &gt; happened.  It is cranking fine, it just won't keep running unless I keep
&gt; &gt; my foot on the gas revving it, and it backfired a few times.  When I
&gt; &gt; turn the key to the accessories position I can not hear the fuel pump
&gt; &gt; running.  Does this mean bad fuel pump?  I am getting it towed Monday-

no, but when you turn the key can you hear the double relay click, up on
the fire wall top left side in the engine compartment, has two big plugs
with wires on em plugged into the bottom

this really doesn't sound like job that needs to go to the shop and cost
big $$$$$ most likely something worked loose and just needs to be found,
cheap to fix probably expensive to find when paying by the hour
