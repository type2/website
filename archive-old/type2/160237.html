&gt; Does this sound like a seized transmission?
&gt; If so what parts typically fail on a manual?
&gt; I'll probably embark on the rebuild myself if it turns out to be bad though
&gt; I'm assuming it's going to be a big project.
&gt; Thanks!

If the engine's out AND the bus is up on sturdy jackstands AND
if the rear wheels are off, you should be able to rotate the trans-
mission mainshaft through each of the gears by chucking the shaft
in a 1/2 inch variable drill or rotating the brake drums to see if the
shaft is rotating...
