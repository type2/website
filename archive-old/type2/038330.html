Subject: anybody got some vanagon belts?

Anybody have 2 good condition (not out of a crashed car or
brittle/rotten) front seat vanagon belts and hardware lying around at
their house?  I would really like a pair for the front seats of my my 70
bus.  Any info or leads appreciated.

Much Mahalos!!

Greg
