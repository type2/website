Subject: Re: [T2] re: Westy extinguisher size?

I guess if the guy hadn't has full coverage insurance he might have been
more grateful.
Its nither here nor there.
I put a pretty good fire out in a El Camino with a six pack of cola after
I shook the cans real good to get range.

&gt; &gt;The guy didn't even say thanks.
&gt; 
&gt; I wasn't going to mention it but the same thing happened to me.  Now 
&gt; I will 
&gt; start with the small extinguisher and they will have to pay in 
&gt; advance if I 
&gt; need to use the large one.
