Subject: Radio interference?

My radio gets a lot of interference when my  bus is running.  It is even
more noticeable with my CB.  Is this common  with the old points ignition?
I have  only had cars with electronic ignition in the past.  I am using
Bosche Platinum spark plugs and my bus is a '77.  Is there anything I can
do to reduce the noise?
Thanks,
brett
