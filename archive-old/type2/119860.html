&gt; I am suspecting that I have a bad CV joint - a couple days ago it started to

&gt; with the speed of the rear wheel - It comes and goes - I can hear a click
&gt; when I spin the rear wheel - It always goes a way - it did this for a few
&gt; mins last summer and when I took it apart it went away- didn't reappear for
&gt; 4mos.
&gt; Does this sound like a likely candidate ? There does seem to be a bit of
&gt; play in the suspect wheel

If you can move the road wheel in and out while it is off the ground to
any sensible extent then your inner ball bearing is dying.  If you can
move the road wheel up and down or fore and aft then the outer roller
bearing is dying.  On a truly worn rear end you can actually feel the
slack come out of the CVs and differential as you rotate the wheel back
and forth.

CV noise typically appears or disappears in cornering, bearing noise
appears or disappears under acceleration.

                             OOK!
