Subject: [T2] Adding Oxygen Sensor.

&gt; I have an 82 Federal Vanagon, aircooled 1970 cc with FI. The 82's came
&gt; with Bosch's L-Jetronic FI, which for federal vehicles run open loop
&gt; without an oxygen sensor. [snip]
&gt;
&gt; From what I can tell the ECU can accommodate an oxygen sensor on pins 24
&gt; and 23 (shield). Has anyone ever added a sensor to a federal vehicle?
&gt; Does only the ECU for CA support the oxygen sensor as I think the ECU's
&gt; for CA have different part numbers than the federal ones?

I don't know if the federal ECU can support the use of an O2 sensor, though
I'd doubt it; why would VW (Bosch) build in a capacity that wasn't needed?
One thing you might consider if you're going to the trouble of welding in a
bung for the O2 sensor is just monitoring its output yourself, in the cab.
It wouldn't provide &quot;on the fly&quot; feedback information to the ECU, but you
can tell if the fuel/air mixture is essentially set correctly and re-adjust
the mixture if it gets out of whack.  I've seen instructions for various
do-it-yourself O2 sensor monitors on the 'net, and I think these things are
even sold commercially by various outfits.
