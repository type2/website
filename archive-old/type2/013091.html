The best way is to get the complete wireloom (engine compartment) FI
Control Head, Double relay, Resistor unit its pretty much very simple if
you have the wireloom.

You can contact me if you want a wireloom $ 60.00, Double relay $30.00,
Resistor Unit $30.00
Wireloom from body to left side of the double relay $ 15.00

&gt; Volks,
&gt; I am swapping a working FI system to my carbureted 2 liter.  I know 
&gt; about
&gt; the gas tank and fuel pump.......
&gt; 
&gt; My question regards to the wiring at the double relay.  I plan on 
&gt; swapping
&gt; the FI and components, and since my van was carbureted, my fuel pump 
&gt; is not
&gt; wired from the double relay.
&gt; 
&gt; I am wondering if I just hook up the harness to the coil for power, 
&gt; will my
&gt; FI work?  Or what will I need to do electrically to make it so?
