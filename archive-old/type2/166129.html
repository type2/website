Subject: Re: [T2] Paint question...

I remember painting a replacement rear engine lid for my 71 back in the 
70's-kansas beig-?Ditzler lacquer paint- spray, fine sand, spray, fine 
sand, etc- that sucker shone like you wouldn't believe when I was done. 
  Scratched way too easily, buffed out just as easily with rubbing 
compound. The bus is in the woods now; all the paint fell off the front 
where a shop had weld-seamed half a panel and bondoed the center overlap 
(poor priming?-told the insurance co they replaced the whole front 
,,,,,,); my lid still looks great!

&gt; That paint was called japan paint.
&gt; Model T's were refinished this way as well as horse drawn coaches.
&gt;  
&gt; Sand,paint let dry, sand , paint let dry,---until there was enough paint
&gt; on the surface to sand and rub out.
&gt; 
&gt; I believe it was a lacquer based product, and mostly black in color.
&gt; 
&gt; Big tedious process.
&gt; 
&gt; There was no &quot;In by 9 out by 5&quot; back then.
