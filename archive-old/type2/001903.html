I had a problem like this once ... turned out to be a plug wire with a high
resistance. If you've got solid copper wires this is unlikely. Is your
ignition wire from coil to cap also solid?

Try running it at night in the dark. Look for any arcing. Try pulling off
one plug wire at a time and sense if one particular cylinder is not firing.
Careful of getting jolted - that Crane Cam ignition could damn near kill
you. When I try this trick I use a plyers with thick rubber handles.

Also, I don't think you mentioned that you have replaced the coil yet (?).
This sounds a lot like a coil problem.

At idle, if you disconnect the vacuum hose to the fuel pressure regulator,
you should see the pressure drop about 4 psi.

Lastly, and unfortunately, this could also be your Mass Air Flow sensor gone
flakey. Check the archives on that to do about this - there have been some
good posts on shifting the PC card in the MAF sensor if the wipers have worn
thru the resistive layer. I wouldn't try any such trick unless you know for
sure that this is the problem - no need to introduce more problems.

Good Luck,
