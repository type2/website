&gt; Subject: fuel pump
&gt; 
&gt; I am still having problems to start my 78 westy. It is a 2L fuel
&gt; injection. It was parked for winter
&gt; It will start and stop after a few seconds. Sometimes I will run for
&gt; maybe 5 seconds but as soon as I press the gas pedal it dies very fast.
&gt; I checked the cold start valve, it works. Changed the fuel filter.
&gt; When I turn the ignition key on I hear a click from the little box on
&gt; the fire wall (drivers side) I guess that's normal? But I don't hear the
&gt; fuel pump. I disconnected the pump and it works with a small battery.
&gt; Any ideas where I should look?
&gt; 
	And sez me:

	Brian: two thing to look for:

	Are your main injectors working? Had this once. No 
	power to main injectors. Van would start on cold start
	valve, and run for a few seconds. Any throttle, and it 
	got too lean, and died.

	Second, check for a big vacuum pipe off. I had the one from
	the decel valve or the brake booster blow off due to a backfire, 
	and got the similar symptoms, although
	at the moment I can't remember the explanation

	Good Luck
