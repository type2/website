Mike, it's really impossible to say, given the information you've provided. We don't know what year bus (more importantly, what type of motor--1600, Type IV, etc.). We also don't know where the oil was coming from under the bus.

There's a seal in the front of the engine (front means toward front of car) where it meets up with the tranny that could have blown out. There's a couple seals where the oil cooler attaches to the engine that could have gone. The oil pressure sender could have popped out (just below the distributor).

The first two require an engine pull. The latter doesn't.

Try to first isolate where the oil is leaking from (side, front, back); then let us know.

Also, you could simply have a pushrod tube that's got a hole in it and is leaking. It could have been temporarily patched with silicone that's now displaced.

Did your oil light ever come on? Don't ever let it come on...the general rule is that except at startup, if the dash oil light comes on, the damage is already done and your engine will need to be overhauled. Oil is the mainstay of the aircooled cooling system for the inside of the engine (where the heat is produced, afterall). So make sure it's filled to the proper level and never let it get much below that. Don't overfill either; that causes pressure problems, but that's another story.

Good luck! Joe

&gt;Hi all, I just recent bought (at a very reasonable pirce) my first vw bus..
&gt;it needs some work..  Ok, this is what happened... the engine was running
&gt;fine for about 100 miles, then all of a sudden there was oil on the back
&gt;window (a light splatter) and smoke coming out of the engine compartment..
&gt;the smoke after about 3 miles wasn't to noticeable... Anyway, I stopped at a
&gt;gas station and went looked under the back side of the bus and there was a
&gt;steady stream of oil leaking out. .. at the time of the smoke I was going
&gt;about 60-65 through out the journey, and I just turned on the heater right
&gt;before it happened (though I'm not sure that has anything to do with it..)
&gt;Anyway do I have to replace a seal and is there an easy way to do it besides
&gt;pulling the engine?  Thanks again, and it's good ot be here..
