Subject: help with idle and cold start

	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I wrote asking for help with this once before and got no response. I =
guess I will try again. I have a 79 westfakia that runs great with an =
engine w/aprox 2000 miles on it. Cold starts do not happen unless I step =
on the gass. I have been told that w/fuel injection this should not make =
a diff., but it does. Idle once started is low and/or non existant - =
stall. Once I have driven down the block a couple of stops signs later =
though it idles fine 900 rpm. I also have problems with stalls/idle =
after driving for various periods of time both short or long, stoping =
and running into a store and then starting up again. Same sort of =
problem happens here - stall/low idle, drive a little -good idle. Some =
times I get an in between state where the idle is low 5-600 rpm, but I =
can almost hear something kicking in that raises it to around 900. Where =
should I start trouble shooting with this. I have read the bentley =
before with respect to the cold start but find it extremely confusing (I =
will try again - if at first ...........).=20
One last thing, while checking the electrical connection to the =
coldstart I noticed two wires on one lead and only one on another. I =
have another coldstart that I pulled off another 79 (new this by =
checking the front window id#) at a junk yard. This cold start has only =
two wires - not sure what this means but ..... maybe I need to trace the =
wires?? TIA for any help
