You said the key will turn enough to unlock the wheel? Does it turn
enough to move the ignition switch to the on position? This would give
you all normal power, and you wouldn't need that jumper wire to the
coil. You could also try inserting/removing the key several times to
see if it's just a mechanical part of the switch that is hanging.
pretty strange though.
