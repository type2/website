&gt; time it is going to be too expensive.  so, i was wondering if any
&gt; of you out there have painted your rims yourself.  please report on the 
&gt; materials you used as well as long term results. i really dont want the
&gt; paint to start chipping/flaking 6 months down the road.


just cleaned mine real good and then painted em with Rustoleum....3 years
ago and still no problems.  (wrought Iron Black is a great flat black
color)
