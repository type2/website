Dear listmembers,

First I'd like to publicly thank the many listmembers who replied to my
previous message and offered to help my two friends in case of bus trouble
as they take their 2-week trip from Montreal to Alabama. Claire is so
amazed by the many offers for help, she is now almost hoping the bus *will*
develop mechanical problems, just for a chance to meet some of the generous
people. :)  She'll probably join the list once she's back in France.

And now for something completely different: lifting up the poptop has
become increasingly difficult over the last couple of years, in part
certainly due to the additional weight of the 4 solar panels (perhaps 50
lbs.?). As I introduced the bus to Claire and Geraldine, we found that even
working together, the two did not have enough strength to pop the top. So
yesterday I resolved the check the poptop spring mechanism of this '75
Westy. It seems that over time, the coils inside the lower legs of the
articulations have lost some of their strength (and some of their length).
I'm hoping to restore some of their usefulness by adding a stack of washers
into each leg. If that works, I'll let the list know.

Unfortunately, the weakened coils are not the only reason for the problem:
the left rear &quot;scissors&quot; hinge must have been slightly bent for some time
and created a lot of friction. Yesterday, I saw it collapse completely,
i.e. bend into a &quot;C&quot;.  Soooo..., would anyone out there in bus-land have
such a part readily available. I'll pay a fair price plus UPS shipping. 

BTW, it's just 11 days left until the big *Tadoussac* camp-out... 5 hours
Northeast of Quebec City on the St-Laurence river. We're expecting up to 50
busses! See http://www.leswests.qc_dot_ca/ for details.
