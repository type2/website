Subject: Re: [T2] [Q] Number of Gallons to Paint

&gt; How many gallons of paint does it take to spray a Type 2?  Specifically, I
&gt; &gt; have a '71 Camper which should take a bit less than others, given the
&gt; &gt; fiberglass top.
&gt;
&gt; it will take at least one more gallon than you buy....

Unless it's a custom mixed non-returnable...Then
you'll end up with an extra gallon with no shelf life... ;-(
