Subject: Perceived Value of T4 2L engine cores and avoid being ripped off
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

I has come to my attention that there are some of you that think that the T4 
2L engine is basically worthless as a core and you should actually pay 
someone to take it away. (So that they can then sell it at a mark up...)

The core value of the basic T4 2L with nothing, is at least $400 (or more, 
some have a $650 core for the T4 2L) according to most shops. 

True in the past, the valve of the engine has not been much due to high 
rebuild cost and a few plaguing problems.  BUT Now that the they have been 
solved, the value has increased.  Add to the fact that the T1 folks are now 
swapping them for the T1 engine, the value again has increased.


FACT:
Supply: Limited  
Demand: Increasing.

So if you have a 2L core do not get taken advantage off by selling it to 
someone who is telling you &quot;that it is worthless and I will take it off your 
hands.&quot; When in fact has much more value.  Ask yourself: WHY DO THEY WANT IT 
so bad,  if it is &quot;So worthless??&quot;


Example of increase in perceived value:

The WBX engine (that is a T1 engine with waterjackets: Vanagon) has been 
perceived as a bad engine, but some on the VANAGON list have found that with 
the application of some T1 performance parts, a computer chip, some corrosion 
protection and MAINTENANCE, it is perceived as a good engine after all and 
the WBX cores are now increasing in value.  A good used 2.1L is _at_$1000+ up 
from less than _at_$400 a few years ago.
