Subject: RE: [T2] h4 headlights

&gt; If you haven't done this simple SIMPLE upgrade yet, DO IT NOW.
&gt; 
&gt; I didn't even get the nice ones, rather some cheaper versions off of 
&gt; eHaaay for $30 and they are SOOOO much better than the stock lights.
&gt; 
&gt; I have already upgraded the wiring and improved the ground connection, 
&gt; but this was night and day better than even those improvements.


This is a really cheap and easy upgrade that makes a huge difference. We
sell 3 different options, starting at $35/pair. It's worth noting that
technically H4 headlights are not street-legal in the U.S., so it is
possible (athough rather rare) for you to get hassled at inspection time.
(So it may be worth keeping your old sealed-beams; it only takes a few
minutes to swap back.)  Therefore we specify that they are intended for
off-road use only.  Hella does make a street-legal version (also on our
site), although it is pricier and not quite as bright as the others.

Link (note that some are priced each and some per pair, and that some come
with bulbs and some not, as noted):
