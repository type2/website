Subject: removal of heads

--part1_2b.2b62501a.2a841434_boundary

i need to replace my valve seals and push rod tube seals.  i am wondering if 
i need to lower or remove the engine to remove the heads and also what 
gasket(s) will i need to purchase before i start?  another thing--i was 
reading the article   &quot;Hydraulic Lifters and Type IV Pushrod Tube Seals&quot; by 
John Anderson from the type2 library and i was wondering where i can find the 
Viton seals that he mentioned.  This is what he suggested doing:  &quot;Do the 
same to the bores over on the heads. Install Viton o-rings with silicone 
grease (or at least oil) and those tubes won't leak again.&quot;  
one more thing, does anyone know of one supplier that could get us all of the 
above-- the Viton seals, the gaskets needed for the head and valve seals?
any help would be appreciated.  thanks, michelle
