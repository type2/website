Subject: Re: [T2] Need help with the transmission

Csaba,

Ok, this one might be very easy.

There is a coupler between the shift rod and the transmission.
The coupler is made up of two metal &quot;cage&quot; parts with a molded piece of 
rubber in between them.  Frequently the rubber deteriorates and will cause 
the problem you describe.

It looks like this

and is just at the front of the transmission.

Have a friend try to shift and watch this part from underneath...if this 
is the problem, it should be obvious.

Your English is good enough....but you say change &quot;gears&quot;, not 
speed.&lt;grin&gt;

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hi! 
&gt;  
&gt; I'm desperately in need of some help. I have a 1978 Transporter. 

&gt; transmission. After much trying, I found speed &quot;3&quot;, and had to hold it 
&gt; in that position till reaching home, and unable to change to any other 
&gt; speed. 
&gt; (Sorry, if there is any confusion with my wording - I'm hungarian, 
&gt; with limited english in automotive topics) 
&gt;  

snipped
 What should be the problem? And how can I repair it? 
 Can anybody refer me to some webpage to see how should I uninstall the 
 transmission system, and repair it, then put it back again? 
 Or I would welcome any help by mail too - am only asking to please use 
 regular words for parts and tools, or try to explain it to me, as the 
 words used in automotive-repair texts are many times nonexisting ones 
&gt; in my dictionary :( 
&gt; I did much repair work on my bus, this is not a problem, but need 
&gt; words even your wife or mom would understand :) 
&gt; Thanks!
