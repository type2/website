Subject: [T2] Acessory Question on a 70

Hey list...  I wanted to know if the side &quot;camper step&quot; is actually a 
practical option?  I want to buy one but does it really help out much?  Also, 
a question about the heat tube:  Is there a way to put a small fan in the 
duct under the car for a little extra boost of air?  And my last question...  
Does anybody know if rubber clamp downs were acessories in the front of the 
68-73 poptops.  I have seen some with two rubber clamps in the front and this 
may help when the top blows up in high wind.  It just rained hewre today with 
high wind and water got the canvad wet through the lifted part in the front!  
This gets aggrivating!!!!!Well thanks for letting me bother you all with my 
small questions!
