&gt; hey list
&gt; this may sound like a naive question.  i am in putting new pistons and
&gt; cylinders on my engine.  they have come in a box already put together. do i
&gt; have to take them apart and use a ring compressor or can i just put them on
&gt; together without taking them apart?  id appreciate the help.

I just got my case back from the machine shop (yeah!) and the machinist
warned me against just putting them on without pulling the pistons first
- seems he had purchased a set that was missing two rings on one
cylinder, and all the grooves were lined up nice and even on another...
I'll be pulling mine apart when I get them!
