&gt;&gt;  The side view mirrors on my '79 are in great shape except for the gray
&gt;&gt;  plastic that holds the mirror in place is badly deteriorated and I'm
&gt;&gt;  concerned about the mirrors popping out.  Anyone have any thoughts on
&gt;&gt;  replacements or repair?

&gt; That gray plastic is only like a bumper guard. It is not for retaining
&gt; the glass in place.

If they deteriorate too much, the glass will pop out.  I had this happen,
and the glass miraculously landed on grass and wasn't broken.

I put the mirror back together with outdoor-strenth double sided foam tape
between the mirror and housing.  I filled the gap between the glass and
housing with hot-melt glue.
