Subject: tune-up sanity

Thanks to those who held my hand, I got my worn points
set to about 44* -- close enough for me.
For the record, here my method: I eyeballed it using a
.004 feeler gauge as a guide. I think i could get it
closer, but life's too short, eh? I'm ordering a new
set of points, so it'll be easier next time.

As for the mismatched crankshaft pulley, problem. I
checked the timing and it was approximately at 7.5*
btdc (except there isn't a notch). That's what the
books says it should be for a '67 engine and the bus
seems to be running well. So, I made a reference dot
with pink paint, voila! We'll see if I have to change
it. Besides I live at about 4,000 feet altitude and
drive often to 6,000 and up, so the timing is probably
off a little off much of the time. 

The pink dot looks real good in any case.
