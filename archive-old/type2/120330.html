Subject: Re: [T2] Distributer, schematic request (long)

IF you still have the original distributor in your 76
bus it can be one of five different numbers depending
on the build date of the and the vin number of the
bus. 

If it was built before the end of 12/75 and it has a
dual vacuum unit on it, and it is a manual trans bus,
it should be part # 021-905-205AB or 022-905-205AB

If it was built before the end of 12/75 and it has
dual vacuum unit on it,and it has a auto trans, it
should be part # 021-905-205AC or 022-905-205AC

If it was built after 1/76 and it has a single vacuum
on it, it should be part # 021-905-205P or
022-905-205S

 What is the number on my distributer you may ask? 
 No idea.  If I
 find that out I will post it if you want to know.  I
 have not felt
 brave enough to remove the distributer from the
 block yet just so I
 can read the tiny numbers on the backside.
