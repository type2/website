Subject: Re: New stereo placement (long and stupid -TGIF)

Morris Arthur ASKED:::

Me too! My Bus has never had a stereo, and I will feel bad whenever I 
break down and drill a hole in the body for an antenna... One day I plan 
on putting speakers in the doors and maybe the back walls, but does 
anyone have antenna alternatives?


I ANSWER:::

Now, wait a minute.  This is COMPLETELY way out, but . . .

I bought this $5 portable walkaround radio w/speaker at Wal-mart.  I
wanted the headphones that it came with, for my PC's sound card at the
office.  

Recently, I was parked and taste testing a 6 pack of Coors when I
decided to play some mood music.  I tried the $5 portable radio inside
my '78 Westy.  Reception was spottty.

I broke out a bunch of light gauge wires with alligator clips, to try
the conection of the radio [ &lt;&lt;--$5 ] antenna to various parts of the
Westy.  (I could get a good reception if I held on to the antenna, or if
I situated my body in a particular position, relative to the radio,  in
the back seat.) 

Wel, it was four down, two to go, and I remembered this little home-made
embossed sticker at the front/center catch of the pop top.  It said
'antenna'.

Could it be that I finally found the meaning of this ¿antenna¿?

Yep, to make it short, I clipped the radio  &lt; still $5, but now worth
its weight in Cools lite &gt;  antenna to the metal part of this catch and
I received a PERFECT reception.  No touching, no body positioning
needed!!

Of course, this was while at rest (both the Westy and yours truely).

I will investigate the reception while driving, but if it works, you
could run an antenna wire from the radio, behind the dash, UP THE FRONT
DOOR PILLAR and along the side and to the center passenger's compartment
and connect to the latch by the passenger compartment head lamp.  (Yes,
you have take the overhead pannel off.  Lots of screws, but easy to do.)

Can any one else out there try and see if their pop top locking latch is
a good antenna for their portable radio?

Lord, I LOVE FRIDAYS!!
