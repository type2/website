Subject: Re: [T2] Accessory Vespa for Bus 

Also, I am concerned not at all with looking like 
a &quot;stupid trend hopper.&quot;  I'll save that for the folks 
snapping up vintage Vespas to look Retro Cool. 

..ouch .. older, classic vespas and those that own them and work on them do 
it for the same reasons we own and work on our VWs .. I have many friends 
that put just as many hours in turning wrenches and polishing paint on thier 
little two strokes as i do on my bus .. peace .. scott 71 vesty
