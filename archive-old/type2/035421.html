Subject: Carby, Oil and Air Coolers + Tinware
Content-Disposition: inline

&gt;2. the 'pan' type of air cooler (with the oil in it), is that better than
&gt;the foam filter type I have on at the moment....?

If you have a working one, yes it is and you should go for the original. If you don't
the foam filter will do.

&gt;The carby is shot (huge backfiring, fuel leaking [okay, pouring, the float
&gt;is not floating,] and sticky accelerator probs),

I guess you either plan to rebuild it  or replace it. If rebuilding, have the kit
and the Muir book,  a pan to soak the metal carb pieces, and access to a gas station
with an air pump that has a trigger action air release so you can blow out all the holes
in the carb halfs.

&gt; the oil cooler valves (I think) are shot because it gushes oil when its warm,

Oil cooler gaskets? Verify by running the motor and looking up in that area for leaks
(make sure it isn't just the left hand push rod tube gaskets that are leaking, but it would
be logical that your oil cooler is leaking, because....)

&gt;and the round tinware (on the fan housing) behind the generator it turns out was actually for a
&gt;beetle, not a kombi and is pushing everything out of line. (belt jumps off,
&gt;bad thing right?)

Yes that's bad. You have a bug/superbeetle backing plate on your generator, but your
generator is the longer type for a 69-71 bus, right? The correct backing plate for the 69-71
generator is dished like a spoon around the generator to compensate for the longer length
of that generator. If you use a bug backing plate it will push the stock generator out past the
the proper plain of travel for the fan belt, resulting in slipping and breaking fan belts and
overheating oil thinning and leaking motors, and possibly leaking oil cooler gaskets.

&gt;So.... since I'm a bit fiscally challenged at the moment, I've decided to
&gt;save and do the job myself. (It's taken 2 months to get to this stage. At
&gt;3. to exchange the tinware (that round bit on the fan housing), am I better
&gt;off not attempting that myself? (I'm brave, but not totally stupid.)

Sounds good, you need either a bug generator or a bus backing plate to make that work. You
also need a good pair of vice grips, a 30mm socket, extention and breaker bar to crack the fan
nut behind the generator. remove the fan from the housing, remove the generator pulley and lock
the vice grips on the boss of the generator shaft, then lay the vice and generator on the ground
so the vice hits the ground when your turn the gen nut counterclockwise. Now stand on the vice
and gen, while slipping a 3 foot pipe over the breaker bar with your other hand and bear down.
It helps if your strong or have a helper to stand on the assembly while you crack. That's the hardest
part of the job. good luck
