Subject: vacuum booster check vavle ?

--0-1413920804-1023073589=:88686

Hello all,
    In the quest to solve my rough idle, short of putting a rivet in the
throttle plate on my 34pict, I was looking at the vacuum booster check
valve. My wifes 96 Jetta the manual says the check valve should be only one
way. (makes sense to me) On my bus I can blow through both ways with one way
a little more restrictive. Does any one recall these little animals?? Should
I just replace the thing??

Thanks again list members,
Paul Saulsbury
