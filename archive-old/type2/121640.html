Subject: Re: [T2] Heat: Atwood Bilge Blower?

I want to do this on my 71 van. What I want to know is how I could put in a 
multi-position switch or, even better, a continuous resistor to control the 
speed. How much power will they draw? How hefty a resister will I need to 
control the speed? It would be ideal to use a stock VW switch, but the only 
pot on the dashboard controls the instrument lights, it can't be over 10 
watts. If I had to use a multi-position switch, could I use the windshield 
wiper switch and put an inline resistor for a &quot;slow&quot; speed? Sometimes I 
would want to clear the windshield right now, then turn it down for a boost 
while driving.

&gt;I've been using a Detmar blower for almost 2 years now, and I'm very happy
&gt;with it.  I mounted it under the front belly pan where the flex duct goes
