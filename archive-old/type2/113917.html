Subject: Re: [T2] RE: AC Delco Alternator

Well, not really.. my original point was that the alternator be attached to
a bracket where it would be housed exclusively inside the engine compartment
(attached to the motor) and not housed within the tinwork.

Sigh.  Your premise is incorrect. 

The alternator in a 72-79 VW bus is NOT in the engine compartment.

The alternator in a 72-79 VW bus is in a small space that is more-or-less
between the fan housing, cylinder head and exhaust manifold.
