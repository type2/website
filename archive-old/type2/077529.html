Subject: 71 heat control levers

Hi Folks,
  I've been laying on the front floor of our '71 wondering how to fix =
the broken heat control levers in my dash.  The only parts yard around =
here with buses doesn't have any for an early bay.  The metal levers are =
broken off just above the dash and of course there are no knobs on them. =
  So I'm wondering;
    1.  does anyone have a pair of these levers to sell me?
    2.  what do I use in place of the plastic rivet that holds the 2 =
pieces of the lever together?  The dealer says the OEM part is no longer =
available and I dont see anything in the usual catalogs.
