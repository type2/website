&lt;&lt;That's a good point.  On cars with rear disc brakes (more and more of

about that one.&gt;&gt;

Emergency brake on four disk brake cars, Mercedes uses the inside of the disk
as a little brake drum with tiny shoes, cable actuated by the pedal left of the driver
(in LHD cars), the Golf 16V has a cable attached to the rear calipers which clamps
the caliper to the disc mechanically. I would not recommend a park-lok or similar
device as it is not a backup for the main system, bear in mind that an emergency 
brake should always be mechanically actuated, not hydraulic, pneumatic, or 
electrically.
