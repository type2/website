Subject: Re: [71-72 &amp; 73-79 bus brake servos.  what is difference?]

&gt;  &quot;Joe&quot; &lt;jmitchel_at_xxxxxxxxxxx&gt;  said:
&gt;Gary,
&gt;Ron's AKA the busdepot ,info is correct, to be a little more specific the
&gt;chassis numbers for the corresponding change over is, brake servo ATE
&gt;'71-'74 (214 2110 465) and brake servo Bendix '74 (214 211 466)-'79. I
&gt;cannot say for sure weather they will switch out or not. My head says no.
&gt;Also I wonder if Ron's AKA the busdepot ,rebuilt/ new is transposed, the
&gt;rebuilts are usually the old ones and the new are the newer although his
&gt;part numbers look good,

Then Gary Akers spewed forth voluminously:
I salvaged a white-on-blue sticker off my 1971 Westfalia Brake servo which
says:
v
Bremsgerat T 51           (the a has 2 dots over it)
3.6142-1202.4
ALFRED TEVES GMBH FRANKFURT/M.
v
I found this OE part# 211 612 103 A in catalog _at_  www.ate_dot_de
Is this the new one or the old one?  Was the original 73-79 servo
10 inches in diameter or 9 inches?  Is this replacement ATE
part suitable for any type II, both or neither. Source of confusion
is that from archives, I would have expected an 8inch ATE for
early and a 10inch Bendix servo for late busses.  What will
9inch T52 part below fit? Will pushrod clearance be close enough?
*Iff* it bolts on right on a '71 and a *little* rubbing on the handbrake
cable is the *only* problem, I'm thinking of using it on a '71.

CONTINENTAL TEVES (ATE)

OE Number: 211 612 103 A
Trade Number:  300044
Properties:  Parameter T52, Diameter [in] 9, Pneumatic
  ---end---
If I'm wrong, I'm [ouch] out close to $400 and a rebuilt unit goes
on instead;  If I'm right I get a factory new servo on my '71
