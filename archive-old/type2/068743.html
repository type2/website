Subject: heater fan

I've got the fan housing off the motor and the fan.  To get the fan off the
motor, it looks like a weird clip thing that I have to pinch and then slide
to get off the little pin.  Is this correct?  Please tell me what to do
next!  Its not as straightforward as I thought it would be (duh, its a
Volkswagen!!!!)  TIA
