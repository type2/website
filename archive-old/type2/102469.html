Subject: Re: [T2] suspension

Add coilovers.  My '70 has them.  It adds a respectable amount of stifness 
to the rearend.

Eron

&gt;Anybody know if/how I can stiffen the suspension on a Baywindow?  I use
&gt;the Single Cab as a work truck (a very sexy work truck, I might add) and
&gt;I'd like it to be able to carry the necesary weight without looking like
&gt;it's laying an egg.
&gt;It's rated as a one ton I believe and not that I'll ever load 2000
&gt;pounds onto it, I'd like it to handle better when it is under load.
&gt;Thanks for your help.
