Subject: Re: [T2] Starter woes - Did I screw up!!!!

&gt; When I pulled if off I counted 5 wires off of the nut - 5 I counted.  Then
&gt; when I put em back on I looked around and cleaned up - i thought - 5 - plus
&gt; the two connectors the push on.  So I put the starter in and put the wires on
&gt; and ... missed one - a big one.  My wife put the wire on the battery terminal
&gt; as I was going to try and start up the bus.  It started but the starter was
&gt; wrong - so I ran around back and pulled off the wire to the battery.
&gt;
&gt; I went back underneath and notice a big wire that I missed was on top of the
&gt; starter - I'm not sure if it was the wire from the battery or the other big
&gt; one.  Damn.

A zip-tie will prevent this embarrasment, I promise you.  Various years ov
Volkswagens have varying numbers of ring terminals attached to that post,
but the one characteristic they all share is that they are all full rings.
A zip-tie or the twit-tie from a bread bag will keep them all in one place
an prevent &quot;lost&quot; or &quot;forgotten&quot;  wires.

&gt; So ... I took the wire that I had missed and cleaned up and put it on the
&gt; starter and tried again - the solenoid was really really hot hot hot.
&gt;
&gt; So I waited a little bit then tried to start it again.  This time the starter
&gt; wouldn't disengage.  I turned the key off but the starter kept running.  So I
&gt; ran around back and disconnected the battery again.

I agree that your solenoid may be cooked.  It may be savable with removal,
lubrication, and reinstallation but since you can buy the solenoid
separately for only $20 or so this is probably not worth trying.

                             OOK!
