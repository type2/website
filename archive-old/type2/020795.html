Subject: query on using new archives on type2 site..
References: &lt;3.0.5.32.20010316074339.007a1a70_at_pop3.rockisland_dot_com&gt;

I had reason to go to the new archives to check out rear engine seal
replacement and noticed 2 things-no way could I combine rear + seal or
real and seal or &quot;rear seal&quot; so it recogizes I want those words together
and not separately in same message (ie, got 577 hits -adding engine to
search helped a bit :)- The Boolian choice didn't work.  Can this be
done?  Also I seem to remember the old archive gave the POSTER of the
message in the excerpts pulled by the search- not so in this one- why? 
(IE, I value certain people's advice over others).
