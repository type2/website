Subject: Dormobile drivers cab bunk.....101

This is aimed specifically at Dormobile drivers.......we're, that's us 4,
are off for a trip north to Norway coming October and as 1 of the 4 is only
2, the other 2, being the adults, excluding the new 1, not yet born,  would
like to know if any 1 out there has the illusive front cab bunk....to house
the 1 who will by then be 2 !!!
A fun numeric folly but with all serious intent as 1 can muster on behalf of
3 becoming 4 looking forward to 4 travelling north in 1 that hopefully wont
go 86 !! ( as my previous 1600 did )
