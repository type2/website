Subject: Re: [T2] Gen/Alt Pedestal Assembly

Thom sez:
 
&gt; So, does anyone know off the top of their head:
&gt; 
&gt; a) whether the metal &quot;baffles&quot; (for lack of a better word) on the gasket
&gt; point up into the pedestal or down into the block
&gt; (i seem to recall down into the block)
That&quot;s Correct down
&gt; b) which direction the )))) point in (left, i believe).

The tops of the archs face toward the center of the case.
 
&gt; I've got it on there, and it looks right, but I'd rather get
&gt; it right first off and my bentley, which i'm assuming has this
&gt; sort of info, still hasn't arrived in the mail.  *sigh*
 No fear, I have an extra Bently I'll loan you today......
