Subject: tires for 74 westy

Joel if my information is correct you should not buy trailer tires.  I
have been told that trailer tires have a very short tread life.  They
are made to just transport trailers short distances, like a house
trailer from one site to another.  Surely your tire dealer wouldn't sell
them to you.  Good Luck
