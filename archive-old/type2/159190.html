Subject: Re: [T2] Yet another Not-a-new-bus

Open-source cars? The automakers like to make lots, and lots of money or 
they would be building cars like the original Beetle which could be 
repaired for-damn-near-ever. I think if they had their way we would only 
be able to buy repair parts and repair services from the dealer. There 
is a HUGE amount of inertia in the auto industry and thus things change 
very slowly or not at all. I deal with the auto industry through my job 
and am surprised at how screwed up some of these companies are that we 
deal with. It is a wonder that any of the domestics even manage to build 
a vehicle with the cpmbo of union tension, management issues, Asian 
economic pressures and design processes. My boss told me after an 
especially trying week of dealing with Ford that if he had a Ford he 
would sell it TODAY b/c it is a wonder that they are able to build cars 
with the way they operate, andhow good would it be? D-C and GM are no 
better.

The inertia in the domestic car makers is demonstrated by the 
unwillingness to build desirable cars while they let that market slide 
to the imports. Once the Asians get around to building REALLY, REALLY 
good trucks (they only build REALLY good trucks now).  If you pull 7K lb 
loads regularly - ie need a dually - you can't buy Asian - yet. 
Eventually the Asians will beat Detroit at that game too and then 
Detroit will be TOTALLY screwed (instead of just mostly screwed now). 
I'd like to see the domestics win but they won't make the changes 
necessary. We have domestic cars in the extended family and ALL of them 
have had some major failures along the way under 135K miles. Our Hondas 
and VWs just keep going with some minor attention hear or there. When 
they need attention it has been easy to repair, economical to repair, 
and minimum of hassle.

We are doing open-source cars right here on this list. We have learned 
our Bus designs and we have made improvements. We have traded our best 
ideas and methods openly and we are all better for it. If we could take 
a bus chassis and reengeineer the chassis to make it more modern, more 
safe and add things like power accessories and a/c and 200 HP (that is 
make it equal to a modern Toyota) then we'd be like Linux - totally 
capable and mostly equal with some details better refined... &lt;grin!&gt; 
(and a big secret to the average person).

That is what I am doing with my vintage VWs. Refinement, resurrection, 
reegineering what I can, and repairing everything.
