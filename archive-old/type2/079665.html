Ok, so I have to move in the next month or so, and I have some stuff =
lingering in my basement that I don't want to have to relocate.  Here =
goes:

Type IV longblock
    I dissasembled this two years ago with the hopes of rebuilding it, =
and ran out of time.  Put another rebuilt engine in Frances instead.  =
Original case and heads (I believe) of a 200,000 mile engine as well as =
all other parts.  Make me an offer.

BN4 Heater
    Bought from a listmember 1 year ago for ~350.  Never tried to get it =
working, but I think all the parts are there.  Make me an offer.

All stuff is in Berkeley, CA.  I would prefer not to have to ship, but =
what the heck.

Later,
Niall (Frances '76 Westy)
