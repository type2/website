I'm betting you put a brand new Bosche 009 distributor in there.

If so, find a good stock dizzy and replace it if you wish not to live with
the surge.  The vaccuum advance in the stock dizzy takes out the delay/surge
(that's EXACTLY what it is for, to advance timing based airflow, rather than
engine speed).  The 009 was developed for racing engines, and so peformance
at low rpms was not a concern.  Obviously, in daily driving, it is.

aircooled_dot_net may have some rebuilds, but you can't get them new, I
understand (and am happy to be corrected).

Hey Volks,

My recently rebuilt 77 2.0 liter FI engine hesitates slightly when I
accelerate, then surges strongly. Once under way, it runs fine and is very
responsive. Also I can detect a very occasional miss when the bus is idling,
which may or may not be related. What is going on here?
