Subject: Re: [T2] Side View Mirrors

I replaced both of mine with the OEM chrome mirrors from the Bus Depot last
summer. So far so good. I'd be concerned about glass falling out if I was just
replacing the glass, especially at $30 a crack.

'76 Westy &quot;Peapod&quot; 175k (still hibernating, &amp;*^%&amp;*$ salt!)
'80 MB 300SD &quot;Phoebe&quot; 160k (same as above)
'96 MB E320 &quot;Dixie&quot; 130k
'87 BMW K100RS 100k

  They wanted $30 per mirror. Is that a fairly standard
  rate? Anyone else had to replace a mirror lately?

  I just thought that $30 per mirror seemed kind of
  steep. Especially when I can get the good OEM ones
  from BD for a few bucks more new!
