Subject: Re: [T2] Friday bus sightings

Since it's Friday and all, just for the record it's not a &quot;new&quot; movie, it's
an old movie being recycled with a new cast. the original came our in the
60's, so I assume this new version will have a few bits that wouldn't have
been acceptable in a family movie 40 years ago.

Geez, I feel old!
