Subject: Need door panel fresh air ducts

Does anyone know of a source for the fresh air ducts that mount on the door
panels of late model buses? I bought a couple from an online vendor and one
of the two was broken along the rear edge and missing a mounting tab. The
vendor's explanation was &quot;it is difficult to find uncracked ducts&quot;. I'm
looking specifically for an unbroken right side duct in black for a '71 bus.


To any potential vendors out there. . .

What you want from me:

	My return business.
	Recommendations to my friends and associates.

What I want from you:

	Knowing the condition of the item I have purchased BEFORE you ship
it.
	A trouble free transaction.

I don't consider a broken part a &quot;quality used part&quot;.
