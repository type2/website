Subject: Power Bleeder

Dear List-

I am going to be digging into my brakes again this weekend.(1974, stock
brakes) I've been looking at power bleeders on the net and I've had an idea
that I want you folk to shoot holes in. What if I carefully drill and tap my
reservoir cap, fit it with a nipple and hook it up to a garden sprayer? When
I'm done I can just cap the nipple. Is there pressure in the reservoir when
braking? I notice that the cap is vented, so there can't be too much
pressure, right?

Tell me why I shouldn't do this and maybe offer alternatives if you have any
ideas.

 Thanks in advance,
Dave
