Subject: RE: [T2] nose panel???

&gt; The replacement nose panels I have seen around seem to have a 
&gt; little raised area where the emblem is mounted. Anyone know if this
take 
&gt; the standard 7 inch emblem, or do they take some wierd smaller version
like 
&gt; the Brazillian models had?

They take the stock 7&quot;  '72-79 emblem. 

&gt; Also, only the chrome ones are available now, can I just have 
&gt; the body shop blast that and paint it white like the original?

Actually, we now have a small quantity of white emblems in stock. This
is the first time we've had them in years. Besides being the &quot;correct&quot;
color, they're also $10 cheaper than the chrome ones (which are actually
just chrome colored plastic anyway).
