Volks,
  Whilst perusing the local auto wreckers as one does after church on a
Sunday afternoon, I came across a rather new looking voltage regulator in
the remains of what was by now a rather beat up '74-75 bus. Of course,
anything new and shiny looking in a scrapped VW is removed first and
examined later, and upon inspection the voltage regulator I found appears
to be identical to the one I have in my '74 bus, except that the
inscription on the side of one reads 'BRASIL   AD1/14v', whilst the other
says 'SPAIN  ADN1/14v'. Anybody out there know what the difference is, if
any?
