Subject: [T2] brake lockup

My 1969 Bus had this same problem, and I paid a mechanic to find the 
trouble, as I was away from home, and I had some reservations about driving 
her home in that condition. So, I shelled out the bread for a brake job. 
They did cylinders and pads, not the soft lines. Lo and behold, they locked 
up on me once again. So, I took her back to the mechanic to fix the problem 
I had paid them to repair in the first place, and they just charged me for 
more unnecessary work. I decided they would never touch my bus again. When I 
got home, I checked the archives, and I found that the master cylinder 
pushrod simply required an adjustment. I did it in less than five minutes. 
There is a diagram in the 68-79 Bentley book of the proper pushrod 
dimension. I apologise for the long post, but I just want you folks to know 
to check that pushrod first before you pay some pseudo experts to have their 
way with your bus.
