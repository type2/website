&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; So 3 busers walk into a VWFLAPS; a barndoor owner, a splittie owner, and
&gt;&gt; a 'loafer.  They walk up to the counter and the loafer says:
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; &quot;I want to get a price on the complete exhaust system for a 79 bus&quot;
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; The parts man falls to the floor laughing, incidentally hitting his head
&gt;&gt; hard on the counter.  The fellow employee dials 911, but it was too late.

Then the splittie owner says, &quot;wait a sec...&quot; and runs out to his vehicle.
He grabs his BA6 heater and asks the other guy behind the counter for
a LONG piece of gas hose.  Also grabs jumper cables and a new battery. Guy
behind the counter says, &quot;wait a minute, I need to look that up....&quot;

NOW it's too late.

Not much better, but....
