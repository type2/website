Subject: Re: [T2] Re:  Bus Sub Questions - water leak, will a deep cycle
  run an  amp?

&gt; door, was very wet First question - Does anybody have
&gt; a &quot;9 times out of 10 if your floor is wet right there
&gt; it is from...&quot;&lt;&lt;


Hi,

My guess is that its leaking in through the driverside middle window. Are 
the deals old and kinda hard?

If so the water is seeping in under the deal, running down the door panel 
and then pooling on the floor in there...

Thats assuming it rained or u went through a car wash...

:)
