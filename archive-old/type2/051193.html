Subject: [T2] Importing German-spec Eurovan into the US -help

My folks will be retiring next year and moving from Germany to the US (Wisconsin).  They would like to bring their '94 Eurovan Westfalia to the States with them.  It is a German-spec camper, 2.0 4-cylinder 5-speed, &quot;California Coach&quot; model.  I have tried to find out if/how it would be possible for them to legally import this vehicle and basically come up empty.  The actual shipping is already taken care of - we're only interested in what it will take to get the van legally registered.  They are sentimentally attached to this vehicle and would probably not flinch at spending a significant amount of money on it if necessary.  If anyone can help, my parents and I would sure appreciate hearing from you.

Thanks,

-David
