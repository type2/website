Subject: Re: [T2] 71 Westy

 And sadly, the last year for the removable rear apron...;-(

Yeah, but the engines were too much for the carrier system that were used,
especially when the engines got bigger. Too much torque.

I am the proud owner of three '71's.. It was a somewhat practical decision,
since all of them were intended for use, saving the best one for possible
restoration later on. For that I can consolidate the best seats and goodies.
I figured that I could get a little stash of spare parts that would serve
all of them down the road. I just bought two fuel guage sending units and
put them up for future. Not many things irritate me more than a funky fuel
guage.
About the front end, I heard that if push comes to shove, the front ends are
pretty much interchangeable.. that you can take earlier/later front ends and
swap them out with the '71. Any thoughts on that?
