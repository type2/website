Subject: a bus sighting &amp; sun visor question....
Mime-Version: 1.0

Good morning!

First, I rented Almost Famous the other night.  For one, it was a fantastic 
movie.  And second of all, just about every scene in the movie had a kombi 
or a loaf in it!  I saw a few crew cabs too.  I think more movies should be 
made with the VW lover in mind.  This one gets my thumbs up!

Second...Well, my sun visors on my 75 Westy are toast.  The foam is all 
gathered at the bottom of them, and the passenger's side was recently 
broken by my dumb ass.  So, has anyone found a visor from another vehicle 
that would work?  $40 just seems like a lot to me to spend on new sun visors.

I'm junkyarding it this weekend, and thought I might be able to find 
something....but I needed some guidance first.

Thanks

Missy:)
