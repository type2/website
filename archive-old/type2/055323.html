Subject: RE: racing steering wheel

&gt; &gt; To answer the silent question &quot;how much harder could turning the wheel
&gt; &gt; possibly be?&quot;, the standard wheel is about 18&quot; OD. Following
&gt; &gt; is a table of
&gt; &gt; wheel-size and additional force required (rounded to the
&gt; &gt; nearest %) to turn
&gt; &gt; the wheel:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 13&quot; = 28%
&gt; &gt; 12&quot; = 33%

it may be harder to turn the wheel, but think of the advantages of the
smaller wheel:

Quicker steering response, for when you want to enter autocrosses.
More room for your knees, if you're a very tall fellow.
Easier to drive while wearing handcuffs.
