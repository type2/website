The steering column is also different. I would have to say no. I am thinking
that you have an early 74 with the dreaded non padded steering wheel.
Unfortunately the column from the two type 2s are different not allowing a
padded late type 2 model to fit. The question now is can you switch out the
steering column. Let me check on that and get back with you.

I have the parts to check it out, but I'm hoping that someone has BTDT
before me...

Will an '83 Vanagon steering wheel fit on a '77 steering column? The
'77s wheel is cracked and way too thin for my big hands.  The Vanagon's
wheel is big and cushy and just what I'd like to have.

TIA.

Jim
