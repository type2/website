Subject: RE: [T2] Injection problems - maybe the fuel pressure?

&gt;Disconnecting the fuel line and making the pump run into a jar 
&gt;produces a bit less than a quart each 30 seconds, which is about 
&gt;2 liters/minute.

One test for fuel injectors is to unbolt the FI rails from the heads and
stick each of the 4 injectors into 4 separate baby-food jars.  REMOVE THE
BIG FAT WIRE FROM THE COIL TO THE DISTRIBUTOR AND INSULATE IT(wrapping it in
a thick, clean, dry shop rag works fine).  Now have someone crank the engine
for 10 seconds or so.  Check the level of fuel in each of the 4 jars to see
if all 4 injectors put out the same volume.  This doesn't tell you if their
pattern is nice and pretty, but it'll tell you if they're putting out fuel.

And don't forget the obvious:  Firing order for a type IV is 1-4-3-2 going
CLOCKwise around the distributor.  If your dist drive is installed
correctly, #1 should be somewhere in the general vicinity of right/rear of
the bus, #4 should be towards #4 cyl (left rear), #3 should be towards #3
(left front), and #2 should be towards the right front of the bus.  Note
that this means the wires for #1 and #2 actually must cross each other's
path to get to the right place while #3 and #4 run straight from the dizzy
to the plugs.

Besides the firing order being correct, you need to check the spark at at
least 1 of the wires.  Points not opening (or not closing), wires connected
to the wrong place on the coil, bad coil, etc. can prevent the plugs from
firing.  To check for spark, remove one of the wires from a spark plug and
pull the metal part of it free from the rubber part then wrap it in a nice
thick DRY rag and hold it about 1 inch from the engine case.  Have someone
crank the starter for just a second or two while you watch for a nice pretty
spark to jump from the end of the wire to the case.  Do be carefull with
this test and make sure you're engine compartment is well aired-out (no gas
fumes in there) and the area where you're testing the spark is likewise free
of explosives substances.

So that covers fuel and ignition.  Only other problem would be air.  No air,
no explosion in the cylinders.  Only way I know for air to be wrong is if
you left papertowels stuffed into the intakes in the heads or if the air
filter is so clogged with oil that it can't pass any air.

Hope this helps.
