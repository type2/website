Subject: '70 Westy for sale
Content-Disposition: inline

A friend who often travels to New Mexico is looking for a 68-71
camper shell (I have a good engine/transmission) for me came
across the following:

1970 Westy - straight, rust-free body, 1600 dual port, runs good
for $2,000.  Owners name is Barry (505) 344-2676.  You know as
much as I do.

1966 Type I - Missy
1969 Type II - Shannon (almost done and ready to come home!)
1997 Jetta GLS - another 600+ miles this weekend - love driving
                 this car!

Getting somewhere without experiencing the journey is never as
much fun.
