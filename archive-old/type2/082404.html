Subject: A few questions...


I'm getting ready to install a donated FI engine (from a 78) into my 79, =
and
of course I have a few questions:

On the right side of the engine, there is a plastic sheath of wires that
come up through the engine tin (right above the mustache bar), it looks =
like
it may be the wires to the alternator.  The wires fork, one set going to =
a plug
that appears to belong to the voltage regulator, and then there is 1 =
single
heavy gauge wire (red) that has been cut-off.  I assume that this wire =
goes=20
to the + side of the battery, sound correct? =20

Then, from the voltage regulator plug, there is a short wire (blue if I =
remember correctly) that goes to a small plastic connector, sorta looks =
like 1 side of an in-line fuse connector but rectangular, any idea what =
this connects to?

Right now, the engine sits on my shop floor, pretty much the way it was =
given to me, still
has all of the tins and such bolted on.  Do I need to remove these =
before I install the engine?  When I removed the previous (non-FI) =
engine, I pulled the rear tins (per Bentley) but I'd rather not do that =
again if I can avoid it.

Also, any sugestions on how to best jack the bus up?  I used the engine =
as a jack-point last time, but of course the engine isn't there now.

Thanks,

Rob
