Thread-Topic: 120V GFI in 71 Westy?

Subject: 120V GFI in 71 Westy?

I've looked through the archives, and the concensus seems to be that the =
little button next to the 120V outlet is a circuit breaker.  =
Unfortunately the button on mine has long since broken off making =
resetting a little difficult.  My question is: Can I simply install a =
GFI outlet instead, and just exclude the breaker altogether?  If not, =
does anyone know of a source for a replacement breaker?
Thanks,
Hal Landvoigt
