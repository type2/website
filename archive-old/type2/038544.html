&gt; All,

&gt; After a few listee's comments on replacing dashlights
&gt; with LED's (apparently a 'Hooverism'), I went to Radio
&gt; Shack and checked out the various options.
&gt; 
&gt; 12v LEDs do exist, but they only have them in amber,
&gt; red, and green....no clear. They have clear in 2v, but
&gt; I figure that'd be way too dim. It seemed like the
&gt; colored LEDs were in a colored-housing, and might have
&gt; a clear diode, so I bought a couple to try out....

RS does sell a &quot;high intensity&quot; LED.  I use one as an indicator for my
alarm system.  It in on the dashboard in an existing hole just behind the
windshield.  It is bright enough to be visible in direct sunlight!

The bad news: Despite the clear housing, the LED glows red.  the color is
the nature of the beast, and a white LED is a rare animal.

This LED needed a dropping resistor to run on 12V.  Just divide 12 by the
LED's specified current in amps and you'll get the value of resistance you
need.  Get something close in 1/2 watt and it'll work fine.

If you want way kool red-illuminated instruments, that is!

I've been thinking of making some taillights out of these LEDs.  Some
truck lights and 3rd brakelights use LEDs very successfully.  After
chasing corroded sockets and burnt out bulbs, it would be nice to have
something that doesn't burn out.  I could even arrange the LEDs in a VW
emblem that gets filled in when I hit the brakes!  :)

 &gt; &gt; Well, it
was indeed a colored housing, but the diode &gt; was colored too:-(
&gt; 
&gt; Also, I compared the OEM light vs. the LED, and the
&gt; OEM was *MUCH* brighter...bummer. If anyone has any
&gt; other suggestions; I'm all ears.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Still, having replaced the single bulb that was
&gt; burned-out (I'd really hoped there were *several*;-),
&gt; my dash lights up to a reasonable level. I guess I'll
&gt; just have to dim the VDO tach (now mounted where the
&gt; clock goes in the guage cluster) so that it doesn't
&gt; overpower the other guages.... Oh, well.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for everybody's help, I appreciate it!
