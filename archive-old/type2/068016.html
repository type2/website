&lt;&lt; I've got the Jacob's Bugpack on my type 1 engine.  I like it.  It
   definitely seemed to make the engine run smoother at idle and have more
   power ( all seat of the pants measurements ). &gt;&gt;

  I picked up a copy of  &quot;The Doctor's Step by Step Guide to Optimizing Your
Ignition&quot; by Christopher Jacobs Ph.D., E.E. at a used book store,,, makes
interesting reading for you techies!!    PINK
