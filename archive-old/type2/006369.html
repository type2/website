Subject: Re: [T2] water on the floor question
Date: Wed, 10 Jan 2001 04:56:52 -0800

There are/were seals at the floor for the clutch and brake pedals, and for
the accelerator linkage.  These can be fabricated from flat foam
weatherstrip material, or even chunks of old carpet in a pinch.

There's a molded boot that covers the base of the emergency brake lever and
also functions somewhat as a seal.

None of these are truly effective if the splash pan under the pedal
assemblies is missing.

If an &quot;official&quot; splash pan isn't available, a substitute can be fabricated
from sheet aluminum.  That pan provides protection to a bunch of important
bits and pieces as well as deflecting water/snow/etc. away from the various
openings in the cab floor.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  ...wondering if there are seals for the accelerator rod going thru the
floor and the E-brake handle as mine does not have any.  &lt;&lt;

&gt;  Yes there are seals here but if you have water coming in through these
holes you should really think about getting a boat instead of a VW.  &lt;
