Subject: Re: [T2] accelerator cable

Thanks, Don.  I'll probably get the dual carb one and try that.  I can't see that I'd need the longest cable.  Heck, at a shade over $3 apiece, I could get all three and then return the ones I don't use.  If Ron would be into that.  

I think the fraying was my problem.  It had tape on it but it had come loose.  It probably came unraveled and then each individual wire popped until the last finally broke.  Live and learn.  I'm going with solder this time.  Cheers...KR

As long as the linkage lets you pull the cable through, just get the
longest and trim to fit. If you have a soldering gun or iron, solder
the cut end so it doesnt' fray. Or wrap some tape around it.

The stock dual carb one (and others I assume) has a nice cast end on
it to fit the linkage... Something for the set screw to tighten down
on. If you find you need something similar, a bit of solder at that
point works wonders as well.
