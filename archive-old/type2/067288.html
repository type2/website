Subject: Value of T4 Engine

Hi All

I need some help trying to establish the value of a 1.7 T4 engine from a
914 I'm parting out. It is complete with the D-Jet FI stuff. Haven't done a
compression test, but seems to run OK. What have others in the list paid or
sold something like this for? I obviously don't want to sell it _too_
cheap, but would like it to be a fair price for buyer and seller. I have
someone whos offered me $350. Considering I paid $500 for the whole car
(wrecked) this sounds pretty good, but the engine is just about all that's
good on this hulk. Any and all opinions appreciated.

john
