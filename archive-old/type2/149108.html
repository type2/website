&gt;  hey guys  I made my own holder many years ago and still use it   I
&gt;  took a piece of metal block and some all thread  drilled two holes in
&gt;  the metal block one the size so that the alltread would go thur and
&gt;  one hole the size of the shaft of the dial indicator  . at the dial
&gt;  indicator hole I drilled and tapped a hole perpendicular to it an
&gt;  installed a set screw to hold the indicator  used two nuts on the
&gt;  allthread to hold this in place  then used two nuts to mount it to the
&gt;  block   I'll try to take a pix

There is also a simplier design that Mark describes but I can't find it
rightnow.
