&gt; Just went to the Raby site referenced in the July issue of VW Trends.
&gt; Very interesting offerings and opinions for those interested. In
&gt; particular,Raby sells a &quot;Powerstroke&quot; 2165cc motor (stock 1.8 liter heads, 
&gt; 78.4 mm crank) that he makes some pretty strong claims for. See for
&gt; yourself at:

Well, I've seen a lot of these &quot;experts&quot; come and go.  This guy seems to
be more interested in 2nd gear burnouts than in longevity.  He tends to
use more hand-waving terminology such as

&quot;It alone makes the huge differences in power and torque, while keeping
temperatures well within parameters.&quot;

than I would like.  What the heck is &quot;within parameters?&quot;

the real find would be a rebuilder who can produce a stock engine with
quality equal or better than the original.  It's a lot easier to produce a
hotrod engine than a well-built stocker capable of delivering full new
engine life.

It can be done (and is in the aircraft business), but without tight
regulation such craftsmen are few and far between.

Before money changes hands you should make sure that this guy can deliver
on his promises, and define exactly what will be delivered.
