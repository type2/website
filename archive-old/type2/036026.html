Subject: Reliability cost

Here is a number worth considering: $100/month for an always-reliable 
bus. I got it by looking at recommended maintenance schedules, the 
experiences of people on the list, and by leaning toward conservatism and 
pessimistism in making up numbers.

Here's the first set:

4 oil changes/year (with filter at each change)		$60
4 sets of valve cover gaskets/year			 10
1 transmission oil change				 10
1 brake fluid change					 10 
1 cable replacement per year (average)			  8
1 wiper blades replacement/year				 10
1 tune-up/year						 24
grease for cv joints, axle, etc.			 10
fluids for maintaining window seals, vinyl, paint, etc.  50

Total annual standard maintenance cost			$192

The rest of the numbers assume 12,000 miles per year and average luck:

							Annual outlay

1 rebuilt head (Type 4) per 1.75 years			115
1 rebuilt engine per 10 years				110
4 tires per 4 years					 80
replacement of brake shoes/pads per 3 years		 20
replacement of brake hoses per 5 years			 10
replacement of fuel lines per 2 years			 20
clutch disk per 3.5 years (with change of heads)	 20
battery per 5 years					 12
4 shock absorbers per 4 years				 25
transmission replacement/repair per 10 years		 60
cv boots per 2 years					 40
muffler per 3 years					 30
annual expense for dealing with dings, paint chips,
	etc.						100
estimated replacement of FI parts			 35

Subtotal for replacement schedule			$677

Total for regular maintenance and replacement		$869

Monthly cost (rounded)					$75

This estimate assumes that a bus is already in very good physical and 
mechanical condition, and that steps have been taken to keep rust in check.

I can imagine that $75/month will sound like a lot of expense to some on 
the list who don't spend that much in a year. But the point of this 
exercise is that beginning with a bus in good condition, driving 12,000 
miles/year, it should cost about $75/month to have a bus that will always 
start, always get you where you are going, do it at legal speeds, and 
will always get you home at the time you promised to be home.

Argument?
