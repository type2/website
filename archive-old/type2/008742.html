Anyone know why the following wouldn't work?

1. Get a metal fuel filter with threaded ends
2. Fill it with activated charcoal (from a fish supply store)
3. Fabricate pipes with flange ends and flared ends/nuts
4. Put some kind of screen at both ends to hold the charcoal in
5. Screw the thing together and fit it in

Total cost (estimated): $25

Savings over RMMW price: $104.00
(Ron's price is a little bit better, but the savings is still enough for 
six CDs)
