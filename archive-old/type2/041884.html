&gt; On my 61, yesterday the generator light started acting up... its wierd.
&gt; 
&gt; At low RPM's the light is off.  As soon as i get to highway spped its
&gt; glowing softly.  As soon as the rpms drop, it goes off again.  the bus
&gt; appears to be charging just fine, its wierd for sure.

Having just gone through this, my advice is to check the generator
brushes.  If the top of the brush is below the top of the holder it needs
replacing.  Check both brushes, as they can be considerably different.
Ask me how I know!

Even if this isn't the root cause it will make troubleshooting easier!
