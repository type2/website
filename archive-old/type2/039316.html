Subject: Portable fridge advice needed

Hello everyone,
I have began looking at fridges because I am going to be
doing a lot of traveling this summer, on the road 2-3 weeks
at a time. I dont want to use a cooler since I'll be
on the road so long at a time and figured this would be a
wiser choice.

So the fridges in the camping world magazine which
ran of DC only brought down the inside temp 40 degrees from
the outside temp. I think they called them thermoelectric fridges.
So if its 90 degrees out side would it work harder and be able to
keep the milk and other food from not spoiling?
I know I would have to buy a extra battery and do the
isolator setup to keep the two batteries separate while the
ignition is off, but what else should I be expecting in trying
to do a setup similar of a westy fridge.

ANY advice welcomed and appreciated on what you guys have done.

thanks a bunch
alex,
