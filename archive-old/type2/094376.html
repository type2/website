Subject: two questions


    Hi Everyone,

    I am almost finished restoring my '79 westy, and I had another couple of
questions. I'm trying to eliminate wind noise when driving on the highway.
This may be too vague for anyone to answer, but I have a noisy passenger
door, and a noisy fiberglass top at the back.

    The seal on the passenger door is fine, but I get &quot;blowing wind noise&quot;
on that side, and I can't feel any wind coming through. Is this common? Any
idea what might be causing it? And secondly -- the large fiberglass top
makes creaking and wind noises. I suspect it's because I do not have a
proper seal on it -- just a back skinny seal, without the extra round part.
Does anyone know if buying the proper seal would help. I only ask because
it's very expensive.

    Many many thanks,

    Sheldon Krasowski
    '79 Westphalia
