Subject: Davis/Northern CA VW Clubs, Alcohol Conversions

Hello all,

I'm new to the list, I finally got a 1976 camper! 

I'm wondering if there are any VW clubs in Davis or Sacramento, Northern
CA in general. Is there a central list of these clubs anywhere?

And alternative fuel conversions. I've heard it is possible to run a
high percentage of ethanol for the 110 octane and emissions benefits.
Would the ethanol eventually only eat the  fuel hoses or could it damage
the metal parts, too? Any ideas on how to find replacement resistant
hose? 

Finally, does anyone know of propane or natural gas conversions that
have been done on VWs? My Volvo ran on 35 cent natural gas for years.
Does the 2L Porsche motor have one or two fuel intakes? That was the
only barrier we found to conversions before, that some VW buses have
two carbs and the natural gas carbs are harder to sync...

Cheers,
Nick in Davis
