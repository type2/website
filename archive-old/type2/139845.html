Subject: Re: [T2] stuck bolts

volks

I had a bad gasket on my exhaust and with emissions coming up I need to
get it fixed.  spot of problem was known and involved taking the 1-2
exhaust header off.  got the 4 studs loose to the head with little
difficulty.
  I have a 78 but have the 72-74 exhaust system.  there are three bolts
holding the exhaust header to the muffler...managed with much verbal abuse
to get the top bolt out.  the other two broke the heads off.  header is
off and the repair needed was made but 2 days of fighting the remains of
the two bolts are still not moving.... have tried
. PB blaster again and again
. heat from torch
. wax from candle
. every bit of profanity that I know.
. getting ready to weld a nut on to give my breaker bar something to grab.

or I have thought of just leaving the remains in place for alignment. put
in the top bolt and use clamps to pull the bottom in tight then a couple
spot welds between flanges to hold em.

any ideas before I start the mig welder up.... has anyone else welded
these together and had good/bad results???

dern problem with the SS muffler from Bus Depot is the mating surfaces are
just regular mild steel not Stainless.  muffler is holding up well, but
the flanges are not.

thanks
Bob
