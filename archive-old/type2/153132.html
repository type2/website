Subject: dome light - ON!

many thanks (again!) to will, who provided me yet another needed 
part... a dome light that works!
at frist, it DIDN'T, oddly. mine, the switch   went OFF - DOOR - ON. 
figured mebbe the wires were fubared after all. then decided to 
experiment - will's goes DOOR - OFF - ON. wired same  as the old one.

it looked like the two lights are actually *different* in the switch 
construction, and i'll take pics tomorrow. i can't describe the 
difference too well now... it was dark out :)
anyways, i need to dig out the wiring charts  again; will, do you 
remember what year bus this one is from?
  like i said, vw had a new - often subtly different - wiring pattern 
for this light each year for the years 68, 69,70 and 71 that i 
recall, so they tinkered with this dang thing quite a lot it 
seems..........
