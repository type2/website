&gt; How about the vehicles in Germany during WW2 that ran on charcoal?
&gt; 
&gt; Now that's_ really_ an &quot;alternative fuel&quot;!
&gt; 
&gt; I wonder if any VWs were wood/charcoal fueled back then.....

Yes there were.  The &quot;cooker&quot; was built on the back of the beetle and
looked a bit like a 19th century locomotive stack.  Wood was heated in a
chamber and the combustible gases stored in another chamber for use by the
engine.  Heaven help you if the apparatus sprung a leak and managed to get
air into the gas storage chamber!

&gt; Is anyone aware of a bus being set up to run on alcohol?  Back in the '70s
&gt; gas crunch a lot of vehicles were modified to run on straight alky, so it
&gt; seems likely a bus or two made the switch.

Brazil had quite a few VWs that ran on straight ethanol.  This isn't
terribly practical in the US, as the agricultural production needed to
produce alcohol for a significant percentage of our cars would require all
our arable land and more.

OTOH, if you have a source of surplus grain and the knowlege of how to
turn it into Everclear, you could run your bus on it.  You would also be a
hit at bus gatherings, but remember to save enough fuel to get home! :)
