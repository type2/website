Subject: Re: Thanks to Karl von Salzen &amp; the List

&gt;&gt;Hello all,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Many thanks to the generous list members, and 
especially to Karl
&gt;&gt;(Also, my p-mail to him is being returned so I have no 
other way than
&gt;&gt;this to thank him.)
&gt;&gt;

&gt;
&gt;Yeah Karl - I tried to acknowledge the light switch you 
sent, but your mail
&gt;is bouncing!
&gt;Get it fixed so we can ask for more things you will 
then pull out of your hat!
&gt;

I have no idea what's going on with Hotmail. For the 
past 2 weeks I have been having problems. Hotmail can't 
find anything wrong.

If anyone emails me and gets an error message, please 
forward it to my Webtv address so I can forward it to 
Hotmail.  aufever_at_webtv_dot_net
I will leave this address in all my messages.

In todays Fresno Bee [Fresno, Cal.]:

66 Bus, new engine, 12v, good body, runs great.$1850  
209-637-0404

That's all I know...
