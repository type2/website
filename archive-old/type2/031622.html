&gt; I am seeking knowledge (no, not enlightenment...yet) and advice on an engine
&gt; transplant from a 411/412 to a '70 Bus.  The engine is in a low mileage

I did this for a spare engine for my 78.

&gt; vehicle, still owned by the original owner's family.  What I am curious
&gt; about are the engine specifics.  I was hoping to grab a 2.) 914

USA, 71-72  was 1700
USA, 73-74  was 1800

all were Fuel injected

&gt; case/longblock, and rebuild it to push my Big Green Behemoth (I mean it in

sorry not compatible

&gt; on these.  Are the calipers the same as the late Bay's?  Are they

no

&gt; injection setup on the motor eventually as well.  Short of the type 4

as I believe someone else stated, there is the rear mount problem....and
the cooling tin is different

as mine is a 78 and has a type 4 engine it was a fairly easy fit, but with
a 71 there is the mounting/cooling problems... but it has been done.

I used a 71, 1700 as a spare engine to swap into my 78 daily driver when I
needed to work on the 2L engine.  I used the 78 fuel injection but
everything else was pretty much the same.
