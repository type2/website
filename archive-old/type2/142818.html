Subject: Re: [T2] Intake manifold leaks...

&gt; Did you retune the carbs because now you've eliminated a big leak?

Heck, I can't get them tuned for love or money now that the leak's gone. :(


&gt; I had the same problem with the dual solex manifolds and carbs. The
vibration keeps loosening those nuts and I had to use some loctite to secure
them once and for all.

Why didn't I think of that? Doh!

I just did another run to Colorado Springs. Just showing off the bus
to the family. ;) Too bad it overheated and ran like crap all the way
home. I even took it easy because it was hotter. Sigh. Now I need to
check the valves. I'm afraid of what I'll find...
