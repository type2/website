&gt;BTW, somebody mentioned they could pull their trans in 20-30 minutes, how on
&gt;earth so fast? It took me an hour to undo the driveshafts!!! Was he using a
&gt;powered ratchet driver? Did he not have to rotate the wheels to get to all
&gt;the driveshaft nuts? FLT for lifting van over drivetrain (took me 30 mins
&gt;to drag it on a board out and to rear of van!)?

Hmmm... I think I mentioned 45 minutes - 20-30 would be difficult, but not
impossible with power tools and a friend helping.  I back the bus up onto
some ramps which gives me the clearance I need to get the engine and tranny
out without moving the bus.  I was able to get the drive shaft bolts out
without turning the wheels.  You're undoing them at the transaxle and
letting them hang, right?  No need to take them all the way off.  The first
time I ever did it was a bear because they were covered with grease and
some were stuck, but now that they have been taken loose a few times I can
remove them quickly.  To summarize:

Drop exhaust, remove rear engine tin
Rear tranny bolts
Front tranny bolts
clutch cable
shift linkage
reverse light switch
ground strap
Engine crossbar mount bolts
CV axle bolts
fuel line (disconnect and plug)
Carbs, air cleaner
Brake booster hose
wiring plug at regulator
starter wiring

There might be one or two things I forgot.  I do the carbs, intake, and
exhaust to make it less bulky, they are not technically necessary to remove
to get the engine and tranny out.  I think it's easy to do all of the above
in an hour and I've done it in 45 minutes.  The whole assembly balances
nicely right about where the engine and tranny mate, a bit farther back if
you still have the exhaust attached, and can be dragged out from underneath
the bus on top of your average 2-1/2 ton shop floor jack.  Don't try it
with one of the $20 Pep Boys special floor jacks though, you're asking for
trouble.
