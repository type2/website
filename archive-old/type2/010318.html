Subject: Heater cables question ('75 Westy)

I've got one of those aux gas heaters mounted under the van. It is 
getting colder and I wanted to check the cables.

I took the instrument panel off and looked at where the cables attach to
the levers. To my disappointment, the two outside ones are busted off
(i.e., not attached to a level). Now, my Bentley just came today, so I
cracked it open and found that the photos for this procedure clearly
show only two cables coming up.

My levers are marked (up to down):

leftmost: heat - def.;  centre: Off (temp) Max; rightmost: air

The leftmost cable to the leftmost lever is not connected and the
rightmost cable (presumably to the centre lever) is not connected.

I suspect that the left broken cable goes to the device that directs air
into the rear of the bus and that the rightmost broken cable is the
cable to the right hand heater box valve.

The cables that are actually connected seem to me to be connected to (L
to R), the valve that sends air to the defrost ducts under the
windscreen and the left hand heater box.

Can anyone confirm or deny any of this?
