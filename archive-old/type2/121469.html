&lt;&lt; Apparently we are both right.... from 65-69 the 912 used the 356 motor, 
but in 1976 it was reintroduced as the 912E using a type4 engine. I 
seem to recall reading that Jake Raby owns two of them.

If the donor car is a 912E then the engine will be a LOT easier to get 
parts for.

Happy trails,

Either way, my recommendation stands...Unless you've got pockets
deep enough to enjoy the Porsche benefits in your Bus, the money
you'd get from the Porsche numbers guys would buy more VW on
a price per pound of parts...
Same reason that I sold a 912 ('69) that I had gotten for free for
a very tidy sum...The Porsche didn't run and I didn't/couldn't put
that much $ into it to enjoy the Porsche experience...I've driven a
friend's 911 (he's a real mechanic and rebuilt the entire car, start-
ing with a non-mover that was left for repairs with him and never
picked up) After I saw the bills cross the twenty grand line, I knew
I had made the right decision...There's no free dog, even if it's a
pur sang pooch...;-(
