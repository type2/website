Searching through the archives for a quick cure for my icing Weber
carburetor, there were a couple of notes referring to an English product,
the &quot;Inlet Manifold De-icing Unit (IMDU)&quot; that is a miniature heated blanket
that wraps around your intake manifold.

Wondering if anyone ever dove in and got one and how well they think it
would work on a single carb setup.

In a note I received from Dave Moore of IMDU he says that the manifold
heaters are:
 3&quot; H  12&quot; L    the extra long are 3&quot; 14&quot; L

Thought maybe two of them, on either side of the carb, might do the trick,
or maybe help anyway.

Driving down to Colorado in a week so I'm more than a little worried about
getting stranded when the temperature drops along the way.

IMDU's website is at:
