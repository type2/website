Subject: Stella's shifting problem... part 2
Message-ID: &lt;376AF647.C689C79C_at_mail.ripon.k12.wi_dot_us&gt;

ok.....now that I've got the old lady fired up and ready to go..... I
tried (with little success but more knowledge :-) ) to fix my shifting
problem.  For those of you who remember my previous posts..  the shifter
swivels and slips out of the joint underneath the splash pan.  its more
like a pin in a slit.....the pin sits very high in the slit, therefore
pops out to both sides of it whenever I move the shifter left or
right...its fine forwards and backwards...
my question is....how can I fix this??? ( the million dollar question!)
I tried bending the pin down...but it springs back up to its original
position....I tried bending the bar that holds the whole rod underneath
the bus back to the tranny up...but it wont budge...

any comments??
I tried to take off my shifter plate inside of the bus...2 bolts... but
someone stripped and welded the forward bolt....dumbass

any help here??  I would like to do this before work tommorrow (11 am)
so that I can work with a clear head and not worry about her....any help
would be greatly appreciated....
