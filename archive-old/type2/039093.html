&gt; Surprise!!  Tirerack sent me load C tires.  Twice!!!
&gt; 
&gt; On the third time, I got my load D tires.

Nothing like service!

&gt; You know, I had both the Yokohama C and D tires in my garage at one time, 
&gt; and side by side, I could not feel any difference.  The sidewalls seemed to 
&gt; be the same in depth and firmness, by touch.
&gt; 
&gt; The load range D say  8PR, while the load C say 6PR.
&gt; 
&gt; But the 8PR have ONLY six ply, as stated on the sidewall.
&gt; 
&gt; Could it be that the 8PR have a larger load ratine, simply because of some 
&gt; testing, and NOT because of a difference in construction.

I really doubt it!  Are you sure that the C-rated tire didn't have 4- or
3-ply sidewalls?

BTW, the idea of &quot;ply rating&quot; isn't a blatent attempt to mislead.  All
tires used to be made with cotton fiber plys and back then an 8-ply tire
really had 8 plys..  Later on, stronger materials (Rayon, nylon,
fiberglass) were used and the ply rating system was invented so that
the strengths of the tires could be compared to the older materials.
Obviously, the ply rating system has outlived the use of cotton
plys!
