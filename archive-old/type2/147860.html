Hi Emily. I remember you from &quot;back in the day&quot;.

At 12:00 PM 9/16/2005, you wrote:
&gt; &gt; it deserves to be loved.  One winter I rented a garage for it, but that
&gt; &gt; isn't available anymore.  We don't have a garage -- if we did it would be
&gt; &gt; pretty easy to park her in there and feel OK. But it's just not right 
&gt; to let
&gt; &gt; a Type 2 sit in five feet of snow for five months.

I had the same problem with my '71. Drove it less and less every year. Soon 
I wasn't driving it for months at a time. I ended up spending $200 on a 
10x20 canvas carport thingy that I figured would keep the worst of the 
weather off of the bus for &quot;a couple of years&quot;. Well, 6 years later it is 
still up and protecting someone elses car now. I have a garage now that I 
live in Orlando. But, between the $200 I spent on the carport thing and 
$150 I spent on a good waterproof cover, the Bus was in almost as good a 
shape as could be expected. I still have to replace window rubber and some 
rust patching, but at least it doesn't get wet inside every time it rains.

I wouldn't junk it or sell it just yet. Throw a couple of tubs of Damp-Rid 
in it, get it covered well, and run the engine every month or two. Roll it 
back and forth at least a couple of feet every time you start it and change 
the oil once a year, at minimum. It isn't the best storage, but it 
shouldn't get much worse for years when treated like this. Mine didn't. 
Trust me, the time will come when you want to drive it more and more. It's 
a hassle with the little kids compared to another minivan with automatic 
doors, AC and all of the other luxuries, but the nostalgia can't be replaced.

Chris
