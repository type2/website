&gt; SamiYep... you don't want to turn down undersized rotors. As you know, 
warped rotors are caused by excessive temperatures, and the usual causes 
are from riding the brakes (ala riding the brake w/ left foot, while 
driving down the road), or from the brake pads rubbing. A lot of GM cars 
came from the factory with this problem, in the 80s.

When you rebuild the brakes, a light polishing (shining) of calipers and 
pistons (use emery or crocus cloth) can remove any corrosion &amp; make them 
slide freely. If they are free from pits, it's much cheaper to put in a 
rebuild kit, and you probably have a system that works better than new.
