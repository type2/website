Subject: Re: White LED's answer..... and request for 81'Vanagon AirFlow Meter.

the AFM  circuit board is &quot;segmented&quot;- the meter jump
is normal, but a bad trace is not repairable. as long as
the readings scale normal, don't spend $ until you at
least check the exhaust system-especially the copper
gaskets at the exhaust ports and the muffler gaskets.
look for external carbon deposits....Dave...
