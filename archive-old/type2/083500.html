Subject: Re: [T2] Wiper Juice coming out my Steering Wheel.

Hello,

I think this happens to most first time bus owners. It
happened to me. To fix it, I had to replace the washer
hose that went from the sprayer nozzle to the steering
column and the washer hose that goes from the washer
bottle to the steering column. If you really want to
do it right, you should replace all the washer hoses
but these 2 are the ones that are causing the problem.


To replace these, Disconnect the end of the hose
attached to the bottle and disconnect the end of the
other hose attached to the sprayer. Make sure that the
bottle is empty first. Then bend open the metal clamps
that hold the hoses down. I know there is one of these
clamps at the steering column but there may be more.
See the box right underneath the steering wheel where
the turn signal lever comes out? Take the two screws
out that hold this housing together. You may have to
remove the plate that is under this box as well. These
2 halves come apart. Remove the old hoses from the
valve in there. Be careful not to break the plastic
nipples! Cut 2 new hoses the length of the 2 old ones.
Fit on the new hoses. If I remember correctly, there
should be metal clips that go around the end of the
old hoses. Remember to use these on your new hoses. If
there isn't any, I would suggest buying a pack of
clips and put one on the end of each hose or else you
may have a leaking problem again. Now just put
everything back together. 

This is what I did to fix my leaky steering wheel. I
apologize for the wordy instructions but I tend to do
everything the hard way. If you have any questions,
feel free to email me or the list. Good Luck!

&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; I tried to get my wiper juice working for the first
&gt; time, and when I
&gt; pressurized it, juice started coming out of the
&gt; steering wheel.  Is this
&gt; normally wired this way?  Has anybody else had this
&gt; problem?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for any help on this issue.
