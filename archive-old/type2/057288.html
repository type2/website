Ron,

The fact that you're tuning-in to your client base, and are willing to
address possible deficiencies/mistakes in a public forum, demonstrates to me
a higher degree of integrity and customer care, than I've experienced from
most service industry businesses.  I'm glad to see you respond so
directly and quickly.

What are the best times to call The Bus Depot?  or conversely, What hours
are high traffic and should be avoided??
