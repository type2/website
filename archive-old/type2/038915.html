...and the reverse mojo theory.

I have this theory that if I'm thoroughly prepared for a disaster, said
disaster will not happen. It's not a fool-proof theory, but it works
more times than not.

Now, I know many will tell me why having metal bars on my front bumper
will be useless in the event that another kamikaze deer steps into my
path one of these nights. Even halogen lights mounted on the front
bumper won't help if Bambi decides to just drop in front of my bus at
the moment of impact, like that one in Texas.

BUT! I'll feel better having the bars, lights, spare tire, etc., on the
front of my bus -- the reverse mojo factor. No deer will dare cross my
path, cuz I'm ready for 'em! I'm also not worried about having bars
attached to my front bumper bending the frame cuz I won't be hitting
anything, see?

I *do* draw the line at deer whistles, George -- I'm not a total nimrod. :-)

Nikki
