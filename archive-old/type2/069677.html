&gt;think I'm going to have to take mine to a shop to get some diagnostic

&gt;it is supposed to do but it did not work well enough to let me travel with
&gt;the Inuvik trip.  A major disapointment.  Now I guess I will have to try
&gt;to find out what is really wrong.

Johnny, 

Thanks for the confirmation on the vw hubcaps.

Just tonight I picked up and put a few new seals in the engine compartment:
the oil filler tube boot, the oil pressure sender boot, seals for both heater
tubes, and the large grommet covering the hole through which the accelerator
cable passes in the front tin. I would guess that I covered 3 or 4 sq. inches
of &quot;leak&quot; especially that around the filler pipe which is a direct feed of
hot air into the motor. I also changed my sparkplug wires which included new
seals for those holes as well. Then I went for a test drive.

Digressing a second, I also fiddled with the timing by ear til it sounded
better. That was a mistake. Within minutes at 60mph the temp shot up to 250
and showed no signs of stopping. I pulled over and backed the distributer
clockwise (retard or advance?)about 1/2 inch which lowered the idle for which
I compensated with the idle screw until all seemed happy again. My point is
not to demonstrate my foolishness but the fact that timing obviously does
have a big bearing on temperatures.

Back on the road, I simply could not get it to exceed 215 and for the most
part it maintained 210. Granted it was a relatively cool night but that is a
huge improvement for me. I also let it stand for a while and it had no
trouble maintaining 210. In addition the engine cover which normally heats up
quite a bit, was very cool while the deck area ahead of the engine
compartment which has lost most of it's insulation was fairly hot.

You may have caught my post last week about using some tin to fabricate a
replacement for the missing heat shield over the muffler. I think that was a
big part of my problem and seemed to make a big difference during my last
road trip. I'm making that same 200 mile trip this weekend and If I continue
to hold my road temps under 220 I will become a fanatical member of the air
leak gestapo.

Hope this might give you an idea.

Weston
