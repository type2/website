Subject: 79 Westie camper FS

This is a hard one for me...the Roadwarrior is a special bus to our
family, but with the impending closure of my work facility, I'm going to
have to start selling off some of my &quot;stuff&quot;..

I don't need more than one camper....

Body originally came from Aridzona, and has not been winter driven....no
holes, but does need re-finishing...driveline is 1.8 with approx 30,000
miles...interior is orange plaid...has box, and stool options....and a
good awning...

Fresh brakes, KYBs and the correct bus tires...manual transmission.

I wouldn't hesitate to drive this bus anywhere in North America.

Have a JPG if you'd like to see it.

Asking $4500 (US$)...make me an offer...

Den.
