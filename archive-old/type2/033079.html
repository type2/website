Subject: gook in the idle jet

To paraphrase another listee, I'm getting way too good at cleaning out my
idle jet.  I yanked my tank, had it completely cleaned and lined, new carb
not too long ago, new gas lines, filter, etc.  I still get some tiny clogs
that lodge in the jet and manage to wreck the idle.  I take it out, blow it
out, and off we go.  Now, assuming the gas tank renew folks are being square
with me (good local rep, I believe them), I figure the only place the stuff
could come from is from flaking off the fill tube sleeve, which is original.
After 30 years, I'd say it has a right to get a little flaky.  Anybody got
something to say about that?  Thanks, and have a good holiday.
