&gt; &gt;Your prayers may be answered.

&gt; Ooooohhhhhhh... now you've done it!  :)  I had no idea these were
available.  It's not clear from their web page whether or not the stock
hubcaps fit - they say the Vanagon hubcaps will not fit but I thought
those were a direct swap for the bay ones?  I will call them as soon as
they open to find out - I wouldn't want them unless the stock hubcaps
fit.

From the sound of it, the &quot;chrome center caps&quot; are the stock VW hubcaps,
but I'd want to make crystal-sure before dropping three bills on 'em.  My
measurements of the pix on their web site shows that the hubcap
circle is very nearly the same on the 14 and 15 inch wheels (in proportion
to the bolt circle)

&gt; As for tire choices, they mention 215/65-15 as being commonly available
(and isn't that the Eurovan size?).  I just spent 15 minutes on Tire
Rack's web site and most tires in that size have a max load of 1510lbs.
In the ballpark but a hair under spec - right George?  :)

IIRC, 1545 is the magic number.  I'd rather be well over than slightly
under, particularly if a Westy is involved.

The other consideration is one's steering box.  I don't think that '73 and
up folks have anything to worry about, but '68-72 buses have fragile
worm-and-peg boxes that are already stressed by the switch from bias to
radial tires.  The added footprint of the 7 inch wide wheel and wider tire
will require more muscle power on the wheel and more stress on the box.

&gt; I need $350!

If someone gives me $700, you get the first $350 of it!  :)

George
