&gt; &gt;Has anyone here ever AutoCrossed their Volkswagen Transporter or
&gt; &gt;Westfalia? Just curious.
&gt; 
&gt; In the early 90's when my 73 Westy was fairly new to me, I used to joke that
&gt; I should take it out and autocross it.  I was pretty good with my 87 Honda
&gt; Prelude SI and figured I could race just about anything.

I used to Rally in my old 1960 23window bus. not fast but we were pretty
good.   

I did autocross in my FibreFab Avenger, 1500S VW powered but that is a
different story.

&gt; Then one day I changed my mind.

but the experience will save you on occasion,  BTDT....
