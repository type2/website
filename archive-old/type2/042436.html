Subject: RE: music festival in NY...anyone?

&gt; since ill be leaving next friday for NY, i was just
&gt; wondering is anyone will be going to the Grassroots
&gt; music festival in Upstate NY?   i know dave wolfanger
&gt; and andy kleinhenz are both gonna be there.   just
&gt; wondered if any other listees are plannin on goin or
&gt; even live in the ithaca ny area.
&gt; see ya there!....hopefully in the bus.


I, my wife Evon, and 2 year old Haley go every year.  (This will be Haley's
third fest; she was 2 months old for her first!)  We have friends with VW
vans who we meet there, and we always camp at on-site vehicle camping.  Look
for the &quot;wagon circle&quot; of 4 VW Vanagons with side tents and awnings and
you'll find us. Mine is a blue '89 Westy with a BUS DEPO license plate and a
Westfalia/Grateful Dead skull sticker on the front bumper.  Hopefully we'll
see some of you there!

For anyone interested, the Grassroots festival is about the most fun you can
have on a weekend.  Dozens of bands, ranging the gamut - rock, folk,
bluegrass, world music, funk, reggae, you name it.  Lots of vending and good
ethnic and vegetarian food.  A Zydeco dance tent that goes on almost all
night long.  Kid friendly, too.  Located near Ithaca, NY.  Website is
