Hi all,

Re. egr and those smogtest blues:
 
AS I understand it, egr systems are primarily intended to reduce
NOx emissions, which they do by reducing the combustion temperature.
This can be a good thing re. avoiding overheating, as well as making
less of that ugly brown NOx we all love to hate.

My '78 camper also passed all emissions tests with a nonfunctional egr,
but those tests measure CO and HC, not NOx. I was really tweaked about
that blasted egr functional test requirement until I learned a little
more about its function. It's still annoying, but at least the requirement
makes a bit of sense to me now.

The market for egr parts is grim. My local VW dealersip's parts guy told me that
egr valves are no longer available for '70's buses from VW. A mechanic told me 
they still are available but are,&quot;Ungodly expensive.&quot; I'm not quite sure how 
much that is, but you can guess. I have it from several sources that the egr 
filters are available from VW for about $175. I managed to clean my own 
nonfunctional egr valve up with a lot of oven cleaner, elbow grease, small 
files and picks. Cleaning out a lot of rusty, carbony crud eventually did 
the trick. If you need one in two years, now might be a great time to start 
looking for one at any opportunity. Legally required, scarce smog control
equipment tends to get very pricey at junkyards, since they enjoy a very 
inelastic market (i.e. they have you over a barrel). It sucks, but there it is.

Note that restoring a functioning egr system will lean out your fuel mix, so you
should have a shop reset that with an exhaust gas analyzer after you reconnect
egr. Running too lean will definitely heat up (burn up) your engine.

Drive safely,
Surfer Bob
