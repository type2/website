Wahhoo!! Yeah. Add me to the stats. I picked up my orange '73 Campmobile on
the 3rd September (Matilda). As already posted I managed to break off the
inside sliding door handle on her first camping trip with me.

Otherwise she performed admirably, and the top didn't leak a bit despite
heavy rains.

I noticed although the top has no holes to speak of, the two side vent
zippers were broken (eg. they wouldn't unzip and the track seemed torn). The
back vent is okay.

1) How do you repair this? Is is easiest to remove the canvas and if so what
is the best procedure? or maybe I should just duck tape them permanently
shut to prevent further tearing. It didn't leak..so I am not terribly worried.

Otherwise this vehicle is in fine shape, having passed a scrutinous safety
inspection (required when one vehicle comes from another province (BC to
Alberta). It has a relatively recently rebuilt engine... with a compression
of an even 130-130-130-130 (after an oil change), a new steering box, rear
brakes, and ball-joint, and a new transaxle (replaced this July).

No major rust to speak of, minor ding in rear fender (more like scrape) and
a few chipped paint spots on the nose (from highway driving).

Came with cool funky adjustable front bike rack on front bumper as well as
all receipts since 1973.. all of the PO's previous oil changes, tune-ups
etc... back to her birth. I am the 4th owner.

Every electronic component works, including BU lights.

The driver and passenger seat are pretty beat everything else is good (no
tears in fabric... stool is still there all original manuals, VW maintenance
tickets etc.)

Where is a good place (inexpensive) to get new vinyl for the front?

How much can that cot really hold? It says in my user manual 150lbs (the one
in the poptop... not drivers seat)... anyone tried a larger individual in it?

I am happy not to have the stove, I like the '73 config... with the
jumpseat.. I just wish my fridge would work on 12V to keep things cooler on
long trips... anybody done any good mods or can suggest a good mod for 12V
coldness?

Anyways,... gotta go... I NEED to drive it somewhere... ANYWHERE... I just
HAVE to drive it... EGADS... I am already becoming an addict.. ( i added the
eyebrows and talked to a few VW mechs around here about beefing up the two
Solexes... they suggested going to a single Holley retrofit. Anyone have any
experience with it? Mechs say cuts down gas mileage but will substantially
improve power)

How often should i adjust the valves and rods?


Wow.. too much at once...

Brian
