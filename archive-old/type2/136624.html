Subject: Re: [T2]Blowby out dipstick update update

ok so put rag into breather hole after taking breather off the other night and no oil showed up in the peanut butter jar..

fixed my breather up so that there was no restriction and there was a minimal blowby but not much..

got a new breather all cleaned up and all today and put it on and now my peanut butter jar is over filling again arg*&amp;^(*&amp;^(*&amp;^*&amp;^&amp;

what in the world is going on here..?

why is it with a brather on it has blowby and other times when there is just a rag shoved down in it there is no blowby?

i am confused really bad after a long day in the garage..

if anyone could PLEAsE help me figure this out...this is very frustration i would liek to be abel to ride down the road with my dipstick in the correct place rather than have a peanut butter jar filling up every few miles or so..?

seems to be getting worse with new breather than with the old breather..?

 

 

peace and love

Chris
