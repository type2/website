&gt; I'm new to the list and immediately wished I'd checked it out earlier as I
&gt; did the exact same thing described below. Unfortunately, things are not yet

&gt; valves adjusted, new fuel, fuel pump operational, etc. The bus cranks
&gt; fine, starts to start, and just as I am congratulating myself, it
&gt; dies. I suspect the cold start valve, but I thought I would ask for
&gt; suggestions before beginning detailed troubleshooting. I recently
&gt; acquired a VOM to test the FI system, but I'm hoping it's something
&gt; simple that I've missed. Any help greatly appreciated.

sounds like it might be the double relay, check the fuel system, there is
a switch in the ignition system that turns the fuel pump on to start the
van, but as soon as the van starts it shifts to being controlled by the
AFM. (which also could be a problem, that plug is notorious for working
loose) it sounds like your starting circuit works but as soon as it tries
to shift to the &quot;run&quot; circuit the fuel pump shuts down and you stall
