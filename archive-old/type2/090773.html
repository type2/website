Subject: Re: [T2] Gas in oil

Yes TOO HIGH . 
After 20 years of working on them I have seen compression
reaching nearly 170 . That's too high . With worn rings and even a worn
cylinder , oil and oil pressure can make it into the cylinders . Just
because you haven't seen it , doesn't mean that it hasn't happened .
