Subject: Re: [T2] solid/hydraulic swap?

Plated crap has no smell, the plating process seals the terd forever. it is
definately worth the added money..

Don't bother going into the hills, I'm there now, the terds go up hill too.

I never stated anything to offend anyone, I could care less if people want
to take risks with patching things up, it does not and will not have my name
on it so in reality I posted here and got in trouble, as always.

&gt; &gt; karl,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; what is your problem?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; scott lyons
&gt;
&gt; I don't have a problem.
&gt; People spreading false information and bullcrap have a problem.
&gt; Like I said in my last reply to Jake. End of discussion.
&gt; All of you guys can sort thru the piles of BS and spend big $$ for gold
plated
&gt; crap. I don't need this. Have you noticed there in no reference to VW in
my
&gt; email address? It means gold fever. I am going back up in the hills. It is
nice
&gt; and quiet and peaceful there.
