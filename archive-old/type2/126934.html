&gt; Hi All,
&gt;  Has anyone tried mixing the components of a
&gt; westy interior?
&gt; Say the X-Bed from a 75-76 with the Table &amp;
&gt; Jumpseat from a 71?
&gt; I am looking for something like that. A little
&gt; bit more seating room, View
&gt; thru the right rear window, but still a bit of
&gt; storage. I am not sure that
&gt; I want a Sink/Stove/Fridge yet...
&gt; 
Yeah, that's what I have, and what Greg Potts
had.  http://www.pottsfamily_dot_ca/westfakia/
And almost what spiffy had

I think it's a great setup for me because I have
children and never cook in my bus.
