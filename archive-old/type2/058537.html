This came to me on another (non-VW) List, but the message is universal.  

Here in Tacoma we've had 4 broad-daylight, busy-street rapes and attempted 
rapes in just a couple of weeks.  The world is changing, and we are well 
advised to be more vigilant even as we regret the need to do so.

&gt;&gt; A good reminder to use common sense over common courtesy when your instinct 
tells you to...

This happened in Columbus:

A woman was shopping at the Tuttle Mall in Columbus.  She came out to her car 
and saw she had a flat.  She got her jack and spare out of the trunk.  A man 
in a business suit came up and started to help her.  When the  tire had been 
replaced, he asked for a ride to his car on the opposite side of  the Mall.

Feeling uncomfortable about doing this, she stalled for awhile, but he kept 
pressing her.  She finally asked why he was on this side of the Mall if his 
car was on the other.  He claimed he had been talking to friends.  Still 
uncomfortable, she told him that she had just remembered something she had 
forgotten to  pick up at the mall and she left him and went back insid the 
mall.

She reported the incident to the mall security and they went out to her car.  
The man was nowhere in sight.  Opening her trunk, she discovered a briefcase 
the man had set inside her trunk while helping her with the tire.  Inside was 
rope and a butcher knife!   When she took the tire to be fixed, the mechanic 
informed her that there was nothing wrong with her tire, that it was flat 
because the air had been let out of it!

The moral of this story...learn to change your own tire, call someone you know 
and trust to help you or call mall security in the first place to assist you.

Please Be Safe....and not sorry.   Although this happened in Columbus, it 
could happen anywhere - there are many dangers around. Just a warning to 
always be alert.

Pass this along to every woman you have access too.  Never let your guard 
down.  That feeling in your gut may be the voice of an angel.
