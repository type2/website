Subject: Re: [T2] Part number match/ compatabilty

&gt; sounds like people are thinking that the decel valve
&gt; has fuel connections. (&quot;drying out&quot;)
&gt;
&gt; it doesn't. it's a vacuum part.

I am still just beginning to learn about this engine and how it works. I've
never worked on a FI engine before and have just the most vague idea of how
the whole system works. I was thinking more in terms of the fuel pressure
regulator, also a very expensive item, btw.. but it appears that most of the
parts on this system are. I just bought a new oxygen sensor (Bosch) for
about $30.00, and that is probably one of the least expensive components on
the system. I guess that they're only good for about 30K miles.
Hey! If a used part might work, then go for it. For $5.00? Heck yeah!
