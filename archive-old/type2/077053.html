Subject: Re: [T2] do i have the correct camshaft?

&gt; Bill,
&gt; How many miles on the engine since the rebuild? How have you broken it in? Could simply be the rings haven't seated yet. Check the archives. Lots of advice there on break in procedures. I bought a Ch*** back in the 70s for $200  because it was a dog after a complete rebuild. The P.O. was
&gt; disgusted with the results and just wanted to get rid of it. Gave me the receipts from the rebuild. Looked like all the right parts for a good hot rod rebuild.
&gt; Changed the oil, and took it for a long drive from Phoenix Az. to Flagstaff Az. First some flat easy driving then some heavy duty mountain roads. 2000 ft to 6000 ft change in elevation. Seemed to get more powerful by the mile. Changed the oil in Flagstaff then returned to Phoenix. The
&gt; following weekend took it to the drag strip and clocked 13.2 sec. 1/4 mile. The best $200 I've ever spent even though it was a Camaro.
&gt;  This isn't how you want to break in an air cooled engine but it is important to put a load on the engine to get the rings to seat properly.

&gt; &gt; rebuilt type2 1975 1.8L
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; here's the problem: got everything together and it ran quite well but had no guts so i checked and compression was 80 all the way around... rebuilt heads, new mahle p&amp;c's... hmmm...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; the only thing i can guess is that my cam is wrong (it was meshed with the crankshaft just fine), put the wrong size shims under the cylinders, or gaskets btwn cylinders and heads, or my valves aren't making a good seal... but to start i thought i should make sure the cam is correct:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; here's the number for the cam:
&gt; &gt; 021-109-11-b-19H -3
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; that's on the gear... on the shaft itself i find, in between the lobes, from the gear back:
&gt; &gt; F7
&gt; &gt; C1
&gt; &gt; CWC
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; does this mean anything to anyone? incidentally, my machinist ordered me regular bearings and such and said that nothing needed to be oversized or reground or anything when i got the stuff back...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; any ideas?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; thanks!
