&gt; Bob,
&gt; My story started like yours, but turned into a worst case scenario.

trying to make me feel good eh???

&gt; Busdepot new elec portion

yeah my probable route

&gt; Removed my elec part, installed Busdepot new one, no go.
&gt; Removed Busdepot part, installed used elec part from &quot;bus&quot; housing, no go.
&gt;
&gt; Removed my housing and worked all combinations elec switches with my
&gt; mechanical and key, checking for results with my VOM, no go.
&gt;
&gt; Mech switch had some wobble in the part that engages the elec switch,

seems like that is an awfull precise fit then.

&gt; and taught myself how to pull the tamper'd mech portion from the bug
&gt; housing over the course of two hours.  Broke down my unit and did the
&gt; same with minimal help from Bentley.

duh looked today that is a contortionist nightmare getting up in
there.

if it is the mechanical part I think I might end up with ye olde
push button on dash for starter

thanks
Bob
