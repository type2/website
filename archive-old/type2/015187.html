&gt;Hi David,
&gt;
&gt;Did you have a chance to check out your Freeze 12 on a
&gt;real hot day?  I hope it's still working for you.  I
&gt;can't seem to keep some of the blends I tried in my
&gt;old cars cooling for more than a couple weeks.
&gt;
&gt;By the way, Freezone has a nice web site with info on
&gt;many types of refrigerant &lt;www.freezonerb276_dot_com&gt;.  It
&gt;turns out that Freezone is almost exactly the same as
&gt;Freeze 12.  They both have about 20% HCFC 142b and 80%
&gt;R134a.  I've heard that both work well, but wanted to
&gt;hear how your Mustang is cooling these days.  I'll
&gt;have to order through the mail, and although Freezone
&gt;costs more at $10/can, I think you can buy just a few
&gt;cans to try it.

Rob et al,

I saw an ad for &quot;Enviro-Safe&quot; refrigerants that claim to be the equivalent 
of 18 oz. of R-12 or 16 oz. of R-134a.  Claims 100%  compatibility with both.
A 12-can case of this ES-12a is $68.00.  Order/info site is:

http://www.autorefrigerants_dot_com

or you can call them at:

1-800-524-5987

Any BTDT?  Caveat emptor, YMMV, etc.
