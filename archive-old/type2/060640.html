Dan is right that the VW kit is better than many of the aftermarket kits,
but I have found an additional trouble spot in this setup.  On mine, the
clevis pins and cabl end used to go bad with amazing speed and a close
examination showed that the hole in the plate on the arm was very oval.  I
replaced that dog-bone shaped plate and have had no trouble since.  Take a
look at the plate that the cable goes thru if the cable is breaking at the
clevis pin.

In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. 
But, in practice, there is.
