&gt; I've just replaced the beaten and worn twin carb setup on my auto bus

&gt; Having done this, the only cuplrit left in my stalling problem is the
&gt; auto tranny itself.

did you have problems with the tranny before you changed the carbs?

&gt; The transmission drives fairly well, engaging a little heavily but
&gt; driving just fine, for the first 15 minutes of operation.  After that it
&gt; begins to engage very heavily, and slowing down to a halt or any slow
&gt; speed maneuvering becomes a juggling act, driving with both feet and
&gt; three hands.  The drag from the transmission appears to be enough to
&gt; stall the engine, which would normally tick over just fine.

?????  the 73 auto tranny has a vacuum shifter, and it can be adjusted,
there are complete instructions in how to do this adjustment in Bentley
but I would check everything else first

&gt; I know very little about ATs, but I'm willing to do as much spannering
&gt; as I can in order to get the bus in such a condition that my wife feels
&gt; happy driving it.

take the four bolts off the sump pan (drain ATF first)  on the under side
there is a round plate with a &quot;tail&quot; off to one side, it is held on by two
screws, remove this plate, it is the filter, and clean well, replace and
clean sump pan.  replace the ATF and see if this helps

sounds like you ATF pump is starving, also if the ATF pump fails this is
also a symptom, fixing it is next to impossible.
