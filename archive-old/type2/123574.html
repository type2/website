   Hijacking your topic here:
   The orignals keys were chrome plated brass and the newer copies are
steel right?

i was thinking the other way around. originals were steel, and repros made
from sausage. my 12+ year old brass key looks chicken spicy. at least its
doing more for me than my steel half-cut fish tank ornament. should i get
some plastic plants, pirate chest, and a filter?
