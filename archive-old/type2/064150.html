&gt;This is the story: This bus has a recently rebuilt 1980
&gt;engine but the nice old german guy who did the work (used to be on the line
&gt;in Wolfsburg) told me that the 1980 heads are of poor quality and prone to
&gt;failure of the valve seats...

Are the l981 Westfalias also prone to this problem if this is indeed
a problem?  I am having  a head replaced Wednesday and I
don't want this to be a perpetual ordeal.

Because it's Friday, let's sing a little VW Camper song (to the 
tune of Donovan's &quot;I Love My Shirt&quot;):

I love my bus,
I love my bus,
My bus is so comfortably lovely.

Do you have a bus that you really love?
One that you feel so groovy in?
You don't even mind if it starts to rust,
That only makes it a better Campbus...
:)
