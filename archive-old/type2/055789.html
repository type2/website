Subject: diversity (F)

    Since we all share this common interest and communication device, I
sometimes forget how diverse a bunch this really is. In the interest of
mutual understanding, some of the local cultural norms are defined below,

car horn....... a device to be used when riding around town behind the fire
engine in a car parade to acknowledge the triumphant return of the H.S
cross-country team with their state championship trophy.

freeway......... a place to express anti-Karaultian sentiments, satisfy a
burning desire to be bored, and eat food with a plastic fork. I-90 across
Minnesota and South Dakota fills the bill nicely

Vdub bus...... an artifact suitable as a prop for statistical surveys as in
...what percentage of of folks you will encounter locally who are likely to
state &quot; I had one of them things once...froze my ass off in the winter &quot;

waving from vehicle.... around here you wave *to * people to say hello not
*at* people to let them know you are pissed

friggen groovey..... the closest I can come up with is Flamin Groovies a
60's band some of whose tunes translate nicely into accordion driven polka
jams.

Someone once said &quot; anywhere you live it's a compromise &quot; very true.......
sometimes I wish I could get a triple mocha just any old time I felt like
it...... alas, it's not to be.

Just a little perspective from a Rockwellian enclave in the upper mid-west
of the good old USA

Thanks for listening, and have a great weekend
