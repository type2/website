Vintage price lists for just about anything....
Some that I loked at over the past year seem to be pretty close to what
the market is paying...be sure and check out the price for a cherry 1967
21 window deluxe.  $$$$$$$$$$

&gt; For a few years I have been trying to update the value of the VW Bus--If you
&gt; had seen how Low they were some years ago--you would know why the Insurance
&gt; Companies were Not paying market value for accidents involving the VW
&gt; Bus--Just recently I was able to get the Binz listed--It took a lot of
&gt; talking for NADA to believe me.-- About twice a year I receive a form to
&gt; update prices--I could really use all of your help to upgrade the value of
&gt; the VW Bus--It is Most important when trying to get the Insurance Companies
&gt; to pay out fair market value in accident and theft cases.--To date I have
&gt; not lost a case--But the value on The VW Bus is still not were it should
&gt; be--Hopefully I will receive some favorable input from the list regarding
&gt; market value of the VW Bus--
