Subject: Clutch abuse

Hi Volks,

It's amazing how much abuse people can throw at a bus and it will  
still keep running:
http://www.pottsfamily_dot_ca/westfakia/SmokedClutch/

The throw-out bearing survived the return trip to within a mile of my  
house. I was able to nurse it home by shifting without the clutch.  
But by the looks of the flakes and powder in the bell housing  I  
don't think the bus would have gone too much further in that condition.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
