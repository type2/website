Subject: Removing under dash air conditioning?

Hello again, While I am waiting for my sending unit
O-ring, I want to remove the underdash air
conditioning unit from my 75 Riviera. Looking at it,
it appears that it is screwed on from the back side of
the dashboard. 

  Do I have to pull the whole dash off to remove this?
Any pointers from anyone who has removed one before
would be great?

Also once I get this stuff off, I will put it up for
sale. But I don't really want to have to ship this
stuff, because it is kinda big and heavy. So if
someone wants to come pick it up let me know. I am in
southeast Idaho. I will post everything I have for it
after I get it all off.

Thanks,
Shawn R.
