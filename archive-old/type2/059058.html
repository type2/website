&gt; &gt;I want a sunroof in my '74 bus and I am thinking of installing an after market
&gt; &gt;unit. The archives seem to indicate that this can be done.

&gt; &gt;Any recommendations re manufactures?

Off the top of my head..

Webasto, SFC (Stretch Form...), Britech (for sliding vinyl)

&gt; &gt;Any recommendations re type (i.e. sliding ragtag, or other)?

Hmm.  Britech makes a manual sliding rag, but it is only a 36x36 roof.
(36 inches long, 36 inches wide...)  About the highest quality of all the
sliding rags, other then OE, but a 36x36 is a bit small, for a bus.. The
sunlight opening is only around 20 inches, the rest of the hole is covered
by the folded roof.

Webasto has their Big Sky, which is a full power, one touch open, sliding
vinyl roof....NICE!  But pricy.  ~900 bucks installed, if I recall the
last time my boss quoted one correctly.  And i dont think it ends up being
any bigger than the Britech units though....

Stretch is just going to produce your normal pop-up removable glass units,
ranging in size from ~15x22 (or is it 15x20? we never ever see these...)
to a 22x38, which is HUGE for anything except a bus....:)

Stretch makes a few different lines of sunroofs, but the Newport and
Genesis roofs are the ones i'm familiar with.  both feature lifetime
guaranteed silicone seals.  Will not rot, and they wont leak as long as
you install the glass properly, keep the seal clean, dont tear the seal,
or warp the roof/upper frame!  (no sitting on the open sunroof!)
Occasionally, mounting hardware may break, or vibrate loose, which can
cause leaks.  Easy to fix, and not to often, compared to how many of these
roofs there are.   The Genisis has a sleeker look, and on the outside,
looks much like the more expensive power roofs.  (no visible mounting
hardware, which the newport has)  Expect to pay ~100 more for a Genisis

Expect one of those to run 200-350 or so installed.

Stay far far away from Farmont and ASC products.  Many reasons, but the
biggest would be short operating lifespans....Farmont's topslider and
popups are easily replaced, but ASC's inbuilt units are a genuine bear.  

Webasto's inbuilt full power glass units are very nice, too.  The lastest
line, the Air One, is easily one of the best designed units i've worked
on.  Found in 99 Lincoln Towncars, if i recall (from the factory)

  The Starlight series, while more then a few years old, is still a
very good roof.  Starlites have been used in numerous makes and models
from the factory, from BMW to Cadillac.  

There are also your external power sunroofs, like those found in Acura
Integras, and such.  Tilt up, and slide back.

Webasto X48 and X48SS (builtin sliding sunshade, for the sunintheeyes
problem..:) are proven reliable units, with silicone seals, and (with all
Webasto power sunroofs) lifetime warrenty on parts.

Hollandia makes decent inbuilt sunroofs, as well.  I dont know much about
them, but we rarely see one for repair.  Hollandia topsliders are known to
have motor problems...but are a lower profile (inside..) and slightly
larger than the Webasto topsliders.


Whatever you decide to do, it is important to find a reputable installer.
Go in, and watch them work.  Or at least show up a few times, and wander
around the shop till they run you out!:)  (before you purchase, see what
they do to other cars!)  Ask questions!  

After you get your sunroof installed (and I HIGHLY recommend you have it
done by a professional, who does it everyday, and knows the ins, outs, and
quirks of the roofs he works with!) and you have any trouble, take it back
to the installer at the FIRST sign of trouble, or at least give them a
call, and explain what you see as a problem.  Many major problems have
simple solutions when they first start.  (ie:  that sudden
knockknockknockknock coming from you motor tells you its cheaper to pay
the tow home, then buy a complete new engine!)  If leaks develop, and are
allowed to continue unfixed, then eventually the entire car will be
destroyed.  Carpet, seats, dash and plastic pieces will rot from the
water, not to mention rust....

(and all of this applies to factory sunroofs too.  Be they in toyotas or
VWs.)

I'll stop now.:)  any further questions, feel free to email me.

&gt; It was quite an improvement if you like sun in your eyes and rain in your lap.

Rain in the lap could have many causes, from loose hardware, improperly
installed glass (nudgewink:), damaged or dirty seals, or kids (big OR
little!) using the sunroof as a highchair....
