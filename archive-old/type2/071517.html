Here are the stats..
'78 Westfalia, 2.0 liter FI..naturally.
I take off in first gear just fine, but when I grab 2nd it hesitates bad, 
almost dies, but if I toss it in 3rd and lug it, it goes. As soon as I'm up 
to speed it's fine. It only does this after I've come to a stop. Idles fine. 
I've done everything within my own power ie; plugs, wires, cap, rotor, 
points, fuel filter.all cylinders are within specs as far as compression 
goes. The only thing I couldn't do was check my fuel pressure....I don't have 
the guage for it. I eliminated all of the easy stuff. If anyone has had a 
similar problem and fixed it, I'd love to hear about it.
