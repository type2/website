&gt; --Karl,
&gt;
&gt; what does it mean if there's no aspect ratio, what is the assumed/standard
aspect of the tire in this case?
&gt;
&gt; it is a ratio of how the tire &quot;stands up&quot; yes?

The aspect ratio is the ratio of sidewall width to tread width measured in
percent. As an example, if you have a 70 series tire with a 10&quot; wide tread,
then the sidewall would be 7&quot;. 60 series, same 10&quot; tread, 6&quot; sidewall. 50
series, 5&quot; sidewall. And so forth.
A tire with no middle number has an aspect ratio of 82%. Using the same 10&quot;
wide tire as an example, the sidewall would be 8.2&quot;. Lets say you have a
choice between two 10&quot; wide tires, one with no middle number and the other a
75 series tire. The height difference would be almost 1&quot;. 8.20&quot; - 7.50&quot; x 2 =
.90&quot;

&gt; &gt;WRONG size!!!
&gt; &gt;The correct bus tire does NOT have 75 in the middle.
&gt; &gt;It is 185R14.  NO ASPECT RATIO!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Hey Ya'll,
&gt; &gt;&gt; I have been my due diligence on research, am ready to order.  Is there
any
&gt; &gt;&gt; reason I should not order this tire???
&gt; &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, $71 per installed from Discount tire.
