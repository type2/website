I don't believe I said we were going to fabricate such a hose for the filler.
 I did say that we're attempting to bring them in ourselves from either
Germany (expensive, I'm sure) or try to see if the Mexican Buses use the same
hose and get them from there (if they're made there) to see if they're more
reasonable in price.  No news yet, but I'll keep the list posted when it
happens.
