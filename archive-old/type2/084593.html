And your data, please??? Your response is just a testimonial, with citings 
of other testimonials.

&gt;While the Doktor has many opinions regarding many things, I responded to
&gt;this question presented on the list from my own personal experience,
&gt;through year's of hand's on use of Marvel --no guessing games here--no
&gt;hypothetical garbage I've read somewhere.

So you must have data??? Did you put engines through hundred hour torture 
testing with and without the snakeoyl having weighed all the bearings both 
prior to and after testing to determine precise wear measurements????  Give 
us your observed bearing clearances on a particular new assembly, then the 
maintenance schedule for life to failure and the observed bearing clearance 
upon teardown, with the hours and milage of operation. You see what I mean. 
The factory engineers have so much more real data than you or any of us 
that you look rediculous in comparison. My only opinion is, that they know 
more than you, so do as they direct if you expect to get the kind of 
results they expected.



&gt;I have used Marvel Mystery oil in a broad expanse of many vehicle's,

Show me your broad expanse of data. Extends beyond the factory data???

&gt;Nor have I ever had any rings seize in their grooves, or lifter's
&gt;fail,or stick------period.

The same can be said of spec motors with adequate maintenance and no 
snakeoyls at all. What does this prove??????



&gt;Snake Oil?
&gt;
&gt;I don't think so ---
&gt;
&gt;The product has been around since God created earth, and has been
&gt;forever a well regarded product by many---

So has sin.


&gt;Marvel Mystery oil is in no way, shape, or form, a substitute for
&gt;regular periodic maintenance, nor will I implicated that.

So how would you know if the proper maintenance alone was not responsible 
for good results??


&gt;However, for older air cooled engine's, that were designed to run on
&gt;leaded fuel's, and hardened seat's, and updated valves weren't used, it
&gt;most certainly will help in preventing valve and seat failure due to the
&gt;lack of tetra ethyl lead.

The German seats NEVER had a problem with no-lead. Overheating from poor 
maintenance and adjustment is the foundation of most valve failures.


&gt;re many different types of friction interfaces in your engine. The
&gt;current spec, off the shelf, name brand dyno oils are designed to
&gt;address the whole lubrication requirements with no extra additives at
&gt;all. Todays standard dyno oils are a very very much better lubricant
&gt;than the standard in play when your T-II was produced. This is one of
&gt;two reasons later model engines are lasting much much longer than they
&gt;did in earlier decades. The other reason is they are very much leaner
&gt;and cleaner burning which means a lower rate of lubricant detergent
&gt;overload. This is what your earlier engine lacks. In excellent running
&gt;order your 70's era engine is not as clean burning as the newer, higher
&gt;tech engines. Along the same vein, a 79 FI T-IV is a very much cleaner
&gt;running engine than any earlier carb tech.
&gt;Bottom line, ignore all testimonials for all snakeoyls. Only use an
&gt;additive that you can find independent test results on. Do not rely upon
&gt;the snakeoyl manufacturers research, either their in-house or for hire
&gt;'independent' contractor. The engineers at VW know at least a hundred
&gt;times more about VW engine lubrication than the engineers at Marvel.
&gt;You can buy a NAPA brand fuel injection additive off the shelf for about
&gt;$3.99 retail, $1.99 spezial loss-leader discount. 8 oz, 1/2 pint of pure
&gt;100% kerosene. That would be $32 per gallon or the super discount price
&gt;of $16 per gallon for kerosene typically available at less than $2 per
&gt;gallon, $0.25 cents for 8 oz. compared to $2 to $4 for exactly the same
&gt;thing. Read the labels of any bottle you pick off the shelf. If the
&gt;ingredients are not specified, put it back on the shelf. If they are
&gt;specified but you don't know what they are, put it back on the shelf. If
&gt;they are specified and you know what they are and they are available at
&gt;1/8th the cost elsewhere, put it back on the shelf.
&gt;Put the money saved from waste on snakeoyls into improving routine
&gt;maintenance by inspection. Your results will be far better insured at
&gt;less cost per mile for extended safe and reliable life.
&gt;And just to show for every rule there is an exception, manufactures data
&gt;in some cases is valid. Consider that Dupont spent millions of dollars
&gt;on determining the acceptable applications of Teflon and concluded that
&gt;it should NEVER be used in automotive crankcases, yet it is sold every
&gt;day based upon testimonials primarily, pages and pages and pages of
&gt;&quot;Works great, I'm sold!!!&quot; A. Acme, backed up by highly biased research
&gt;data and conclusions funded and directed by the sales staff at WIZBANG,
&gt;Inc.
&gt;And know of a certainty, a half-hour infomercial of constantly repeated,
&gt;canned applause and &quot;OOOOHHH&quot;'s and &quot;WOOOOWWW&quot;'s proves nothing but the
&gt;gullibility of ignorant consumers funding the rich life for charlatans.
