&gt; Have you checked for gasoline in the oil?

Fred,

This may make sense, as my oil, while it didn't smell like gas, did
seem pretty thin (which I attributed to the fact that it was 95++ out)
when I changed it on Sunday.

Since that oil change, I have seen the problem once or twice,
but not regularly.

I'll check the plugs for a rich mixture today.

thanks!
