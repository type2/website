Subject: Re: [T2] More hubcaps

Heck, at that price grab 'em all!  If nothing else, you'll have plenty of
parts pans or, with a little cleaning, some unique snack dishes for your
next party!

&gt; Hi group.
&gt;
&gt; Just a quick question about hubcaps.  Every week I go to the junkyard and
&gt; there are any number of VWs with the familiar small moon &quot;VW&quot; hubcap, most
&gt; just need a quick polishing to be perfect.  Hubcaps at this particular place
&gt; are $3.83 each, and I was wondering if it would be worth it to horde all
&gt; these hubcaps instead of send them to the crusher.
&gt;
&gt; I've always heard they are so rare, and the vendors have replacements that
&gt; don't look 100% correct, but I often see them everywhere.  I could end up
&gt; with quite a collection.  I already have a dozen or so.
