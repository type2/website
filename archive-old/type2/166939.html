Subject: Not the 'T' word...

Just for general information.

I recently fitted Hankook RA08 tyres on the rear of our bus.  They  
are 195R/14 and were fitted at the reccomendations of the list.

For interests sake, I measured the diameter of the tyre (by marking  
the tyre, rolling the bus forward until the mark was at the
bottom of the wheel again &amp; measuring the distance).  The measurement  
came in at  2009.1 mm (6.59 feet).

I then got the gearbox ratios from:	 http://sandlizrd.baja_dot_com/ 
gears.htm 	for our '76 2.0 litre.

I then entered the ratio information &amp; tyre diameter into the gear  
calculator program at 	http://www.locost7.info/gearcalc.php.

This came up with a result of 29.98 kph (18.63 mph) at 1000 rpm in  
4th gear.  Which means that 100 kph (62 mph) = 3350 rpm.

Hope this is of some interest to others.
