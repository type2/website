Hmmm- wonder if my symptoms are related to what experience you had (Matt O)
re pilot bearing.... 53K ago I pulled my engine just to check clutch before
long trip (it had 150K on it...) Replaced the disk and front seal, but
forgot about the pilot bearing.  Out in Montana somewhere, on a real damp
foggy morning, I went to start the car, put it in first, and started it
with clutch in, and it &quot;jumped&quot; forward.  A quick check showed clutch
adjustment was OK, and I &quot;broke it free&quot; by starting the car with brake on.
  I envisioned driving the rest of my drip with no clutch use (I can do
that, but stopping, starting is a pain)- but I had no problem after that
until now, 53 K later.  Maybe just stuck due to the damp weather??
However, I do have shuddering/chattering  in traffic when a lot of shifting
is needed- I always push the clutch pedal in and then out again to stop it.
 I wonder if the pilot bearing is involved in some way in that last symptom?
