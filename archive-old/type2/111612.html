Subject: RE: tuned exhaust

Twas written:
&lt;&lt;What do readers recommend for a tuned exhaust/muffler combination. I like an
extractor style, but they are too loud to enjoy my radio. A stock exhaust
strangles the engine and sounds tinny. I also like the look and sound of the
4 tip Monza, but they seem to wear out quickly and don't do much for
performance. What free flow exhaust and muffler combination are available
that give you the performance boost without the extreme noise? Is there such
a thing?&gt;&gt;

You didn't mention what year bus you have (and wheither it's a stock motor), so
this may limit your options. Here's my feelings on the subject.

The free-flowing extractor exhausts are great for a high revving motor, but
with my bus seldom seeing the high side of 4000 rpm :), I chose the stock 72-74
muffler (I've got a 79).

When the muffler on the extractor that came w/ my bus rotted out I tried to get
a replacement extractor system, but all I got from the vwflaps was an EMPI
extractor that leaked at the welds :(

I ordered the stock 72-74 muffler from Busdepot (the stainless was bo'ed at the
time), and was pleasantly suprised with the low end torque gains I got w/ going
back to a stock style setup.

My advice, go w/ a stock type muffler. The backpressure that it supplies helps
with low end torque, which is exactly what a 4000lb box on wheels w/ 67hp needs
:)

If you've got a Jake Raby special in the bus, disregard the above :)
