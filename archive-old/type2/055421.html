Subject: 1800 valves

Volks- I haven't driven my bus in a few months (doing major body work). I
was also leaking oil from the pushrod tubes, so I took them out, cleaned
them off and put some permatex on them. After I re-installed them, I
didn't adjust my valves, because all the driving I was doing was pulling
the bus back into the garage each night after working on the body. Of
course, my valves sounded funny. So after about a week, I got down and
adjusted the valves cold. I have an 1800 pancake and my Bently says to
adjust the exaust valves to .008 and the intake valves to .006 because
they are sodium filled. Muir says all valves should be at .006.  How do I
know if I have sodium filled valves, and what should I set my valves at? 
All of my valves were good after adjusting them, but when I got to head
#4, intake valve, the valve (or should I say rocker arm) was doing
something funny. All of the other rocker arms, when the piston was at
TDC, would either stay on or off the valve stem head, depending on where
I placed it (if you have adjusted your valves, you should know what I'm
talking about), but this one rocker arm would always stay pressed against
the valve stem head. I loosened it up and that didn't seem to help. I
could hold it off the stem head with my finger, but when I took my finger
off, the rocker arm would snap down on the valve stem head. I ended up
holding it off the valve and setting the lash at .006. When I started up
the bus, shure enough, there was a funny noise comming out of that side
of the engine. I don't want to drive it with it like this, but I really
don't know what to do. Any ideas?
