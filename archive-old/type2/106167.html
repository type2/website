Subject: Re: [T2] Newby

&gt; I've been told by more than one mechanic to get rid of the FI at the
&gt; first opportunity.  It's a bear to work on, evidently.  My own opinion
&gt; is to keep it as long as it's working just fine.

there are a couple of mechanics to steer clear of.
they are too lazy to fix it right so they want to change it to make it
easier for their minimal intelligence and skill level.
