Subject: Re: [T2] cats and rev limiting rotors

&gt;I was reading the Bosch L-Jetronic Lambda FI manual and came across an 
&gt;interesting passage that basically stated that a rev limiting rotor cannot 
&gt;be used with a catalytic converter because at the rev limit when the 
&gt;distributor cuts off, the unburned fuel would pollute the catalyst so 
&gt;instead the engine speed has to be limited electronically.
&gt;
&gt;Do the California ECUs have this feature or did they still rely on the 
&gt;04016 rotor? It would seem to me that all ECUs with the trigger wire going 
&gt;to the coil wouldn't pulse the injectors at the rev limit and this would be 
&gt;the equivalent of electronic engine speed limitation.

Who knows. Bosch does not seem to share the ECU schematic diagrams with the 
public but if you run across one I am interested.

Leaning out the air fuel mixture at max RPM would not seem be the safest way 
to limit RPM, spark or no. Trying to kill spark and shut off the injectors 
at the same time would be hard to do as a  smooth function since the high 
voltage rotor circuit does not talk to the ECU and that is where the spark 
limiting takes place.


As you know at upper throttle  settings the EGR feedback is cut off. Alas, 
just when you need it the most.

With no EGR and a super lean A/F mixture the engine would be prone to 
detonation.

I have come to the conclusion that the non lambda, FI, Cal, VW T2 in SMOG 
tune(1% CO) is a marginal design at best and an engine eater at worst.
