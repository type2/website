Subject: [T2] Hydraulic lifters for '75 1.8...question

Your advice is sought.

I'm taking down the engine in China Cat for inspection, as we bought the bus 
non-running and I want to be sure there aren't any &quot;gotchas&quot; hidden in there. 
One mod I had intended is converting to hydraulic lifters to reduce the 
required maintenance.

Just now, reading through &quot;How to Rebuild Your Aifcooled VW Engine&quot;, it said 
so not mix lifters and cams between mechanical and hydraulic types. DANG!!!

I hope not to have to split the case, and hadn't planned a cam changeout 
unless absolutely required. Here is the question (at last): Is this an 
absolute rule? Are there aftermarket hydraulics that are designed for the 
normal mechanical-lifter cam profile? The engine is code AE.

TIA and Cheers/Carron
