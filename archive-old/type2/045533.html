Subject: [T2] Things for the new motor

I have decided to purchase a motor from Ronnie at Old Volks home.  I
wanted to build a nice solid stock motor.
    I was thinking of putting on a stock muffler.  Is stainless worth
the quadruple in price ~$70.00 for stock muffler and $300.00 for a
stainless?  I was thinking about buying a stock muffler and coating it
with por 20.  Any recommendations?
    I also wanted to switch from the 009 distributor to a stock
distributor.  Aircooled recommended a SVDA distributor that is modified
to work with the 34 pict 3 which I own.

Your input oh mighty list????
