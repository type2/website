&gt;I just encountered my first problem with the 78 bus that I bought a few
&gt;weeks ago.
&gt;
&gt;As I was driving down a busy road (at rush hour!), I depressed the clutch,
&gt;stopped at a red light, and took the bus out of gear. When the light turned
&gt;green, I stepped on the clutch and tried to shift into first. I couldn't get
&gt;it to go into gear.
&gt;
&gt;After fiddling with it for a few minutes, I finally got it into first. But,
&gt;there was a problem. When I put my foot on the clutch, the bus still wanted
&gt;to move forward. Shifting was absolute hell.
&gt;
&gt;I fiddled with the wing nut that adjusts the clutch play, and things got
&gt;somewhat better. I could drive home.
&gt;
&gt;Now, the bus runs, but I still have to give the stick a good shove to get it
&gt;into gear.
&gt;
&gt;Should I continue to fiddle with the wing nut, or do I have a bigger
&gt;problem.

Ronald,
I think you have a bigger problem.  I had a similar problem on a '78 I used to own.  When I was coming to a stop, I pushed the clutch, heard a popping noise and the engine stalled when the Bus stopped.
I assumed the clutch cable had broken, but that was not quite what happened.  What had instead happened was that a couple strands of the cable had broken, so its effective length was greater and it was not releasing the clutch like it was supposed to.
A new cable fixed the problem.  If yours was a sudden development then I suspect you have the same problem, though not quite as bad as mine was (since your engine didn't stall).

Since the transmission is a syncromesh transmission, you can safely drive without using the clutch.  The only gear you need the clutch for is engaging first gear while the van is stopped and engine is running.

To work around that, pick the flattest or most downhill route home, with the fewest stop signs and traffic lights.  If you do have to stop, turn off the engine, and with the engine off, place the stick in 1st gear.  When you are ready to go, take your foot off the clutch, give it some gas and turn the key.  The starter will propel the bus forward and if you are giving it enough gas the engine will catch and you can drive off.  Shifting is done gently, by moving the stick out of gear and then matching the rpm of the engine with that of the tranny.  When you've got it right, the stick will pop into the next gear like you were using the clutch.  It takes practice, but you can do it.

So I'd say off the top of my head that if you replace the clutch cable you will be OK.  If the cable has indeed stretched like I described above, it will soon break, at which point you will find the preceding paragraph very helpful.

Mine had stretched so severely that there was not enough adjustment left on the wing nut to get it to work correctly.

Good luck!
