Subject: Awful knocking noise from rear axle .... Help appreciated

Hi

I can hear a pretty bad knocking noise from the rear left ( if looking 
&gt;from behind) of my 72 bay.  It seems to be coming from either the 
wheel or the rear wheel shaft but I'm not sure as it only happens 
when driving along.  One thing which might help in diagnosis is that 
the noise seems dependant on whether I have my foot on the 
accelerator or not.  If I'm accelerating then the noise seems to 
retreat and if I take my foot off the accelerator the noise seems to 
come back.  knock knock knock... It also seems to be slightly 
worse when cornering.

Anybody have any ideas as to what this could be ???

TIA

Nicholas Buttle
