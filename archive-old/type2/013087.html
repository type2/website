&gt;So, that said, has anyone tried out any of Koolatron's Coolers?  They've
&gt;got a 52-quart chest cooler that's 12V DC and the &quot;right&quot; price: $185
&gt;
&gt;Here's the cooler:

&gt;
&gt;which is said to &quot;cool to 48°F below the outside temperature.&quot;
&gt;(basically all I would need/want it to do)

I posted about one of these many moons back, here's the link to the 
archives:

Short version: use your money to buy something useful. Unless you live in 
the pacific northwest, and never intend to stop for more than 12 hours at 
a time without AC hookups, these things are pretty much worthless 
overpriced coolers. You're gonna have to add ice, so why drop more than 
20-30 bills for the cooler?

Oh, and when you spend $1-200 on a cooler and a bear gets it, you have to 
chase the bear and get it back. Good for adrenaline, but I'm getting past 
my days of wanting more adrenaline...  ;-)
