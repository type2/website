Tom,

Glad you're on &quot;our&quot; team.  So what you are saying is that Tex-exhaust is no
hotter that Wa-exhaust, right? ;-)

Me thinks now the ceramic coating may be a real bad idea for air cooled
beasties of the street for the reasons you outline.  I definitely want
immediate heat dissipation from the exhaust ports.._dot_can we say overheating
and cracked heads?  It would be more conclusive if someone had accurately
measured temperature at the head before and after installing a ceramic
coated exhaust...anyone done this?  Or maybe someone with a 1776cc engine
and ceramic-coated headers could contact me and we'll set up a test and
measure...before I replace my header. Fluke meter anyone? John?

My research today is turning up many reports of cracking on 304 stainless
exhausts, with the better quality stainless being cost prohibitive.
Sigh...it's hard being so AR!

I found myself writing a long lesson on heat transfer and thermodynamics
which
I may at some point post to the archives or post a url to, but is
probably too long
to post to type2 (and which I don't have time to finish).

Suffice it to say, it can be summarized as:
