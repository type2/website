Subject: Re: [T2] Help with buying brass drift for wheel bearing race

Jason:

If you're punching out the races because you're going to replace them then
just grab something suitable and tap them out.  There's no point in saving
old races that I can see.  Brass drifts are designed for situations where
you want to make sure you don't mar anything, which doesn't exist if it's a
&quot;remove and replace&quot; operation.

Subject: [T2] Help with buying brass drift for wheel bearing race


&gt; Hello,
&gt;
&gt; I am about to ride my bike to Sears to get a brass drift set. I need to
&gt; punch out the front wheel bearing races on my bus.
&gt;
&gt;

pid=00946515000&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Will this set work fine? None of the FLAPS have any drifts, just
&gt; punches. And nothing in brass.
&gt;
&gt; Will this set also work for the rear bearing races, for future reference?
&gt;
&gt; Is a drift just a punch with no taper at the end?
&gt;
&gt; Autozone loaned me a race driver set, which was nice of them, and they
&gt; stock inner and outer Timken bearings, in case anyone is looking on a
&gt; Sunday (like me).
