Subject: outside lighting _at_ camp

A while ago I took an old hurrican lantern that leaked and put in a 12
volt light socket where the wick is (was).. mounted a little switch on
the fuel tank part... drilled a rather large hole in the bottom so I
could clean it out real well. got some lamp cord and wired it up with
the other ends having battery post clips (clamps?).
  It was very portable and was nice if I needed to work on das bus on
the side of the road... gave off lots of light! 
  I ended up giving it to a kid I met at a VW meet here in Seattle. He
lived in his bus (I dont) he needed it (I didnt). But I did field test
it for around a year before giving it up... think I will make another..

Also, it worked well when the power went out.
