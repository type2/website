yes, it is the right length cable.  It said on the packaging that it was correct...and
I got it from a VW garage.

There was nothing wrong with the old cable even...so I saved it for a spare......if I
ever get to drive my bus again.



&gt; Are you POSITIVE you have the right length cable? I had a garage sell me the wrong
&gt; size cable on time... pi$$ed me off.
