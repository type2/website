My '75 owner's manual shows the gas tank capacity to be 14.8 U.S. gallons.
The pressure for the windshield fluid container is 42 psi max.
And when the needle reads on the lower white line of the fuel gauge, I have 
been able to then refill with 13.4 gallons; e.g. there must be still 1.4 
remaining when you &quot;exit&quot; the reserve zone. However, individual gauges will 
vary.
