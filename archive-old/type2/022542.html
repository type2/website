Subject: New Tires- OUCH!

Well, my '77 Westy is one step closer to hitting the highways with the
purchase today of new tires. On my old '76 Westy, I took the cheap route
with tires, buying NTB's ( National Tire &amp; Battery) house brand of light
truck tire _at_ $48.00 each. These tires did nothing for the stability of the
bus in crosswinds. After doing some reading here on the type2 library, I
decided on Michelin Agilis light truck tires. At $112.00 each, these tires
cost almost as much as I paid for my Westy! I've read that these are very
good tires for a bus/Westy. I hope so, as it will take a while for the
wound in my wallet to heal.      Jeff S.
