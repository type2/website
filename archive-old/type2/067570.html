Subject: CD ignition on some ~'80 vehicles?

Someone mentioned that certain circa-1980 vehicles (non-vw)
shipped with capacitive-discharge ignition (CDI).  Being cheap,
I'd love to go strip that off a junker.

Any specific make/model on that?  I could spend all day
in the yard going from car to car trying to figure out whether
it's CDI!!!

Thanks

        Gary
