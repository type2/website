Subject: RE: Strap holder behind passenger seat

That sounds pretty original as emergency triangle and first aid kit are
required in every vehicle in Germany. BTW, my first aid kit (usually comes
in a rectangular plastic box) is mounted on a holder below the dash ('74
Westy). Most likely no flares - never seen them back home.

Mine holds an emergency triangle folded up in a blue-grey plastic box, about
14 x 3 x 1 in. Maybe it originally had flares.
