Subject: Re: [T2] pair of wiper arms 68

&amp;gt; No. Only '68 wiper arms will fit in a 1968 Bus.
&amp;gt; By the way: is it possible to change them for a later model wiper arms? If so,
&amp;gt; what do i need to do?

joao
it might work but I would suspect you would need the entire wiper assy.
that might be easier to find over there than 68 wiper arms.
