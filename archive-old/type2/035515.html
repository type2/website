Subject: 1500 parts free for the taking

when i got my bus, it had an extra engine and tranny. i dont want either of
them. i dont want them in the back of the bus, and i dont plan on ruining my
knees for another 3-4 months by carrying yet another engine up to my room..

sooo...if anyone wants any 1500 parts, just let me know what you want. the
engine appears complete, except for the dizzy. the 6v generator is shot (a
tangled mess of copper wire is coming out of the holes). ill be dismantling
the engine soon. if no one wants the parts, ill just toss them in the trash
and burn the case (i really want to see that!)

anyones welcome to the tranny too...its a type 2...


enjoy!
