Subject: Weber conversions

My '73 Westy w/2.0 '77 engine (converted from FI) has a 2-bbl. Weber conversion on it,
which I have been using for about five years, so I have some mileage on the thing.  When I
got the engine, it had been converted to dual used VW carbs, but they were shot, and
needed replacement, and the replacements were ungodly expensive.  My mechanic and I
consulted, and I ordered the Weber conversion kit from a VW store in Portland, OR.  I had
the thing installed.  The only problem was that it needed a plate fabricated to get the
carb high enough off of the manifold.  And the next day we left for a drive from Idaho to
Wisconsin.  We got about 9 mpg.  I ate the cost of the gas, because it was at least
running fine, and when I got back to Idaho a month later, my mechanic and I pulled the
carb out to see what we could see.  It seems that the store had sold the kit to someone
who returned it to them.  They checked in the box, and everything was there, so they put
it back on the shelf.  The original shade-tree mechanic, for whatever reason, had reversed
the jets, and put the large one in the first barrel.  It was simple to switch them back,
and I've been getting about 19 mpg on flat road at 60-65 mph ever since.  But you should
have seen my GAS BILL for the trip.

Moral:  Always check the jets before you install a new carb, even right out of the box,
and don't leave on a major trip after a major modification without giving yourself a
couple of days to drive around and check out any problems.  That way, if you need helfp,
you are not in the middle of Montana...
