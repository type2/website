the question is, did it keep the bus warm???

Bob

&gt; Chris,
&gt;     In 1980 I worked for KLM Airlines at the airport in Amsterdam, Holland.
&gt; They had a number of baywindow buses with upright engines that we mechanics
&gt; could use to haul parts, tools, whatever, around the airport.  A couple of
&gt; them had hot water heat.
&gt;    There was a special tailpipe that ran through a &quot;can&quot; of about 8 inch
&gt; diameter.  Protruding from the side of the can were 2 nipples, each with a
&gt; rubber hose attached.  These hoses disappeared up into the engine
&gt; compartment.  I was told that in the can the tailpipe was wrapped with
&gt; copper tubing and that's what the nipple was that stuck out through the
&gt; side.  In the cab there was a heater box. It contained a heater core and a
&gt; fan with 2 or 3 speeds.
&gt;    Anti-freeze was circulated through the copper tubing and heated by the
&gt; tailpipe.  I hate to say it but I can't remember what was in between the
&gt; tailpipe and the heater box.
&gt;     So to answer your question, yes it can be done.  But like I tell my
&gt; sons, you can do ANYTHING if you are willing to spend enough time and money
&gt; on it.
