Subject: Re: [T2] cargo door handle problem

Ok, thanks Greg and Ian for replying.   Umm, do you have any suggestions for
a retarded owner?  I was a bit embarrassed for not seeing the obvious, when I
read your replies the minute I walked in from work.  Then, I put the handle
vertical and took one of my cats for his first bus ride.  He freaked, and got
a little loose in the bowels.  I was laughing hysterically, which took the
edge off of my embarrassment.

So, I've just posted to this list three times, with specific
questions/problems.  I feel like I'm getting to know some of you, just by
reading your posts.  I'm learning a lot, and am really appreciative of all
the experienced people here, who help us new guys.  It's very very
reassuring.  Hope everyone has a cool weekend!  Anyone from Tucson going to
the Jerome Jamboree?

Jon
