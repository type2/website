Subject: Westy Electrical Panel Question

So I was gettting things sorted out last weekend to get Possum's fridge and
second battery going. Found a broken wire near the panel that has the
fridge switches and the battery tester guage. Well I was being stupid and
fried my transformer by not remembering to unplug the 110 cord when fixing
hte wire... I think I can find another stock transformer from a boneyard.
My question is regarding the battery tester guage on that panel. There is a
rocker switch that energizes the guage when you hold it down. Between the
switch and thguage is a tiny resistor. It is fried and the guage is a bit
corroded. The rest of my panel is in good shape I think. Doesn't look
corroded anyway. Does anyone have this guage and the resisitor theywant to
part with? I have seen the whole panels I think on Go-Westy but man thats a
lot of bread... I suppose I can always wire an aftermarket style tester but
it would be cool to keep it stock.
