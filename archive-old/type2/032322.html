Sheila and I took a few days of sick leave last week and went on a 6 day
excursion.  Same game plan....we just headed out for parts unknown.
Our relationship is better for it.  I've been road tripping since my first
west coast fantasy trip in '69.  Didn't know how Sheila would do since
this was our first trip together.  But can say that we'll be doing lots
more in the years to come.
We went to Coos Bay and hiked a couple of miles in the sand to get a close
up look at the freighter that ran aground there and got to see it burning.
And on Hwy. 101 in a small little podunk town of Cloverdale, Oregon there
is a place that goes by the name of Beaver Creek Bob's.  Ended up chatting
with this guy for over 2 hours.  He has an incredible stash.  One of the
other reasons we clicked so well beides the VW connection was that he also
had a '48 Panhead chopper, a '67 FLH and a '46 Flathead Trike.
He had literally piles of cylinder heads (no 25hp stuff tho) and tin, and
heater boxes, split case and tunnel trannies, etc. etc. etc.
Out back he had a couple of split Busses, Bay window Busses, an oval
windowed Baja, and then a couple of dozen '71 and earlier Bugs.  He's up
on his prices!  I would have spent a ton if I could have got anything for
a great deal, but he wants pretty much top dollar for stuff.
All his stuff is organized and under cover.  He's been salvaging and
collecting for well over 32 years.
For those tripping up and down the coast Hwy he's at 24215 Hwy 101 So.
