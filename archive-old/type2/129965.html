&gt;I've got a page out of a old vw trends/hot vws mag of a company that used to

When I was looking around for info, I found some references to T4 J-tubes 
that someone got from European Motorworks, but I couldn't get their webpage
working to verify it.

You want to talk abour pricey?  See if you can find info on the Tangerine Racing
header systems -- and make sure you're sitting down. =)
