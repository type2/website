&gt; I have the new gasket (025 133 073 ) installed on my throttle body

&gt; this.  They look different as you can see in these pictures.
&gt; 073 Has more ribs on the outer part of the seal. Improved design?
&gt; It appears to seal well.  I've verified vacuum and readings seem good.
&gt; I'll leave Mr. Dolan to give the final word though.

Richard, Alex,

Actually, I was mostly checking to be sure that the part was available
today.  I have installed a couple, but the most recent was a year or two
ago and by times I have been caught by VW obsoleting a part between my
last purchase and my saying &quot;yeah, it's still available.&quot;  I had also
planned to take pics so everyone could see old vs. new but Alex has beaten
me to the punch on that.

But the important datum is that the gasket does appear to be available and
it's fairly cheap. If you have a low vacuum reading then it should be on
your list of bits to replace.
