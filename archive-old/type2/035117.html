Tony, My impression of the book was that being about both the bug and the 
bus, it was a little too general. The type2 library/archive is more 
specific, more thorough, and therefore more useful.

&gt; 
&gt; Gentlepersons- &gt; Anyone familiar with Lindsay Porter's &quot;VW Beetle and &gt;
&gt;Transporter: &gt; Guide to Purchase and DIY Restoration&quot;? Does it cover the
&gt;Bus as well as his &gt; other &gt; books cover their respective topics...911's,
&gt;MGB's, etc. If so, then I'd &gt; recommend &gt; its purchase, even if it
&gt;requires a little translation...Checked your &gt; &quot;gudgeon pins&quot; &gt; lately? &gt;
