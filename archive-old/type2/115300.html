Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Injector Plastic Tip

I asked:

&gt; &gt; I am re-doing some fuel injectors on my '78 and I want to replace the
&gt; &gt; plastic tip that covers the injector.

&gt; &gt; Any suggestions?  -what are they called;

Scott said:

&gt;  It is called the pintle cover.

&gt;If the pintle covers are so bad as to need replacing, there might be other 
&gt;issues with the injectors also.

&gt;   Scott Lyons

}}  Scott, thanks for the info.  I did a search on 'pintle cover' and caught 
a site that had a review on a fuel injector rebuild shop.  I got some good 
idea that FI rebuilding is not a simpleton's job.

My pintle covers are in excellent physical shape.  These is just a slight 
discoloration which I cannot remove with manual cleaning, so I thought I 
could simply slip on new ones.

Yes, I know that the pintle covers would not be visible once installed, but 
I was going to put this set of four FIs on the shelf, as 'stash' items and 
trash my other FI's and  intake manifolds.  I have just put four 'new' FIs 
on the '78, and these four 'stash' FIs are proven good.  They deserve to 
look good, too!!

On the 'stash' FIs, I did replace the 2&quot; hose segments with 7.5 mm FI hose.  
I got the M Benz hose that Karl recommended.  It was easy and fun!!  I also 
have some hose from Ron Salmon that I have used for other elements of the FI 
rails.  This is pretty adequate; slightly larger than the 7.5 mm, it is a 
non-metric size that converts to something between 7.5 and 8 mm, but I 
forget what.  Works well on the rails, but I don't feel it would be as solid 
a fit over the FI 'barbs'.

I used the existing 'cap' at the base of the 2&quot; FI hose, just like the 
original.  I don't feel that FI clamps are needed here, even for fail safe 
considerations.  When the FIs are installed on the rails, the rails press 
the ends of the FIs towards the intake manifold, so any influences are 
directed to keeping the 2&quot; FI hose on the barbs, and not pulling the 2&quot; FI 
hose away from the barbs.

One note:

People were talking about the 'Hoover bit' to protect the fuel hose as it 
goes through the firewall.  Well, my FI rail is LONGER than normal, and my 
metal FI rail goes thru the firewall, connecting to the fuel pump in front 
(FIF) of the firewall.  I have a few other rails that show them to be SHORT, 
and they would use a longer rubber FI hose, one that would thread through 
the firewall.

I now see what the problem is (for other people).  I thought that I was 
normal, and I couldn't understand the need for the 'Hoover bit'

So, as a hint to you junk yard scroungers, if you come across a FI system, 
where the left (FIF, so LIL!!) fuel rail goes thru the firewall, it might be 
worth recycling that piece.  Save for our children!!
