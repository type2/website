To you admin troops, all of ya, I like the new format, ie, without the hassle 
of having to download attached files. Also, BZ (that's a &quot;well done&quot; from the 
Naval Signal Book) regarding the throttling of a couple of recent threads 
which were getting out of hand, off content and far too personal. Keep up the 
great work. Ray in Spokane, 68 Campmobile, 69 Transporter
