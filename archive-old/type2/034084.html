Subject: banging in new rebuild

I have an AVP rebuild, 2.0 L, hydraulic lifters in my '78 Westy that has
about 3,000 miles on it. I broke it in as described in the Wilson book
and it's been running great. But the other day I started her up and
noticed more noise than usual from the engine. It can best be described
as a consistent banging sound, over and above normal noises. I tried to
hunt it down and it sounded like it was coming from the vicinity of the
#2 cylinder. After pulling the valve cover, I noticed that the #2
exhaust valve seems to be moving less than the others on this side while
running. Any ideas? Thanks!

Gordon
