Subject: 2.3 Watt wheat bulbs

I am excited.  I found some Sylvania bulbs that are the same size as the 
instrument panel wheat bulbs, but at 2.3W vice the standars 1.2W

Sylvania 2723 pair of wheat bulbs at 2.3W, about $2....

I installed them in the fuel, and speedometer lights.  I also had a 3.0W 
single bulb I put in my clock.
