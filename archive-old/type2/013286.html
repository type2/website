Subject: Virginia Emissions-80 Westy Passed!
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hi Volks,

I got my Westy through emissions yesterday.  !980s
must pass Va emissions at two speeds, one at idle (up
to 1200 RPM), and one at 2500 RPM.  They don't have to
go on the dynamometer/treadmill.  Also, 1980s only
have to pass HC and CO emissions.

From my experience, you definitely need a working
catalytic converter to get the HC in spec.  Also, mine
easily meets the 2500 RPM emissions, but just squeaks
by the CO at idle.  However, I found out at higher
idle speeds CO decreases.  I usually run my idle speed
around 1050.

The results expressed with limits/measured are:

IDLE HC 220/124  CO 2.00/1.97  RPM  1200/1037
2500 HC 220/28   CO 2.00/0.79  RPM  2500/2435

The only other issue, was returning to idle after the
2500 test.  My Westy either has a sticky throttle
valve or a kink in the gas cable because it is slow to
return to idle.  Also, whether it returns to a slow or
fast idle seems to vary.  It almost failed because of
this slowness to return to in spec idle (I probable
need stronger throttle return springs).

Here's a question for those who have FI Type IV VWs,
what do emission results like these say about engine
running characteristics (rich or lean?, low or high
power?,...).

Rob
