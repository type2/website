Subject: hard start relay
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Has anybody out there ever installed one of the bosch
hard start relays in their bus?
I am doing so in my 72 and have one question.  There
is a black wire with a spade connector which is
supposed to connect to the 50 terminal on the starter.
 There are already two red wires connected to each of
the two terminals at this side.  Does the black wire
replace one(or both) of those red wires or does it
need to splice in?

thanks y'all
