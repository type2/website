&gt;In the archive there is a recommendation to remove or plug the retard vacuum

That can be done.

&gt;Old Volks Home distributor info says to set the timing to 5 ATDC for this DVDA
&gt;distributor (it's from a 1976) and keep the retard vacuum on.

That's right. I'd set it there AFTER verifying that the vacuum can is working. You must do this before relying on the vacuum can otherwise the engine can slowly overheat. I use a mityvac to check the advance at idle by changing the vacuum level.

&gt;My VWFLAPS has a Bentley (I don't - yet!). They said the spec is for 7.5 BTDC
&gt;with retard vacuum hoses on.

Bentley doesn't have complete info in that area.

&gt;Local VW mechanic says to set the DVDA to 0 TDC with retard on, and adjust to
&gt;5 ATDC for smog test later.

But then it will advance 5 deg more than necessary.
