&gt;  Because you sit pretty high in these vehicles and your line of sight is
&gt;  naturally a little toward the ground. They did not bother trying to 
overcome
&gt;  this. They figured that seeing cars on the ground behind you was adequate
&gt;  and surveying incoming air traffic was unnecessary.  :)

This isn't quite true VW did fix this problem but only if you purchased an 
optional extra. 
Rear view mirrors were produced in with three different length stems, as 
standard the shortest length was fitted. 
I cann't comment on the medium length of stem but if you can get hold of a 
long stem mirror they are brilliant as you look back along the road instead 
of down onto it.
Over about 5 years of searching I've found three - one is in my van and the 
other two are in friends vans who also value the considerable improvement.
So keep on looking in those boxes of mirrors that you see at swop meets and 
auto jumbles.

Good luck
