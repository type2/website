Subject: HEAT:Combustion or Friction?

I think I can settle this once and for all.

Next time your van runs out of gas at the top of a very steep hill, put 'er in
4th and ride down the hill with the engine engaged (being turned by the force of
gravity, not internal combustion). Think she'll get hot? I *don't* think so.
Might louse up something else, but it won't be from heat. 

Which came first? The chicken or the egg? When you compress anything, air, for
example, it gets hot. That's how air conditioners work; they raise the temp of
the refrigerant by compressing it, not by heating it with the friction of the
rings of the cylinder. You can compress something by forcing it to occupy a
smaller space by physically giving it less space to occupy. Think about this
(here is the chicken/egg thing): Can you compress a gas/liquid/solid by allowing
it to occupy the same space while causing it to expand by heating it? How about
heating it AND compressing it at the same time? Like on the upstroke of an
engine timed BTDC? HEAT is what makes an internal combustion engine run. If
there was as much heat produced by the friction in an engine as there was by the
combustion process, the van would go nowhere. The name of some law of physics
escapes me at the moment, something about the conversions of energy. You can't
get movement of mass (acceleration) AND MORE ENERGY from the HEAT PRODUCED BY
FRICTION than you put into the combustion process in the first place. The laws
of physics prevail. TANSTAAFL. There is absolutely NO WAY there can be more heat
produced by friction than by the combustion. I suspect it is in the order of
fractions of a percent.
