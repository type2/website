Subject: Re: Short range FM transmitters

&gt;The poor audio quality got me thinking about those  
&gt;wireless connectors to feed the signal from a CD walkman or an ipod  
&gt;into the FM radio. That then led me to wonder.... what's the range on  
&gt;one of those things? 

I have one that I use with my iPod... effective range is probably about 3 feet.
