Hi Anton,

Canvas does shrink a fir bit when washed. Sunbrella is very stable...  
We've had a sunbrella top on my brother's boat stored outdoors 24/7  
for 14 years and it's still in decent shape. That kind of treatment  
would have killed 3 or 4 sets of canvas.


Happy trails,

&gt; Question: Would washing the *new* canvas shrink it enough that one  
&gt; would not have to guess-timate over-sizing it?  Does the Sunbrella  
&gt; stuff shrink as much as cotton?
