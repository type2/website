Subject: Thanks RE Long starter bolt
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Again, thanks to all who have helped w/ starter bolt issue ... I was in a
tight spot when I took the starter out and when I put it back ... didn't
look closely enough and assumed the top bolt went into a threaded hole like
the bottom bolt ... well you live and learn I will fix it tonight ... you
guys are great about putting up w/ my simple questions ... the muir and
bentley books should be on my front steps when I get home tonight ... in the
future, if I ask a question you know is in the archives, give me a hint as
to how to find it ... the stuff is not always easy to find ... believe it or
not I am the type of person that will try to get the answer myself before
asking as long as I am not in a pinch and need the info quick.  Thanks
again!!!
