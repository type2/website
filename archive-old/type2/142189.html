&gt; How can I test voltage regulator and alternator?

What is the battery voltage with and without the alternator running (engine on/off)?

&gt; How do I remove the alternator? Does the engine
&gt;need to be removed from the vehicle?

No.

&gt;There is one bolt
&gt;that goes into the &quot;adjuster&quot; side, and a nut/bolt
&gt;that goes on the &quot;pivot&quot; side of the alternator...
&gt;it looks like there is some tin in the way. If it
&gt;comes out underneith the motor, I'll need to
&gt;remove the heater box/exhaust/ some tin. If
&gt;it will come up from the top, it looks like some
&gt;tin needs to be removed.
&gt; any tips?

The bolt on the bottom connects the alternator to the supporting bracket. The top mount is that t-slot nut where you tighten it done.

On the back is a boot with a clamp that has to be removed with a phillips screwdriver. You also have to remove the alternator wiring harness from the back.

The tin in front of the alternator is held in place by the bottom bolt so you can't remove it without removing the bolt.

You don't need to remove the heater box to replace the alternator but the whole just is somewhat awkard because of the limited access.

Bartnik wrote up a replacement procedure that will help you:
