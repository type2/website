&gt; I did not see the aircooled dizzys on his site but thats not my question.

He sells whatever he has rebuilt in stock. I don't know the turnaround time
if nothing is in stock. I think they go for about $85 when you send in a
core.

&gt; What I did see is Pertronix kits for $81.95. Thats seems pretty cheap, does
&gt; anyone know if he sells the kit I would need for my 78' 2.0 FI for that
&gt; much?

Get 1847 V from RMMW. It's $59.95.
