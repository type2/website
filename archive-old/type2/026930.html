I have a 68 transporter which I just started today.   It starts right up and 
idle's fine.  When I drive it it is extremely weak.  I took the air filter 
off which is the oil kind and it idle even better and ran stronger (a lot 
stronger) but it still is weak. How can I go about fixing this.


Thank You,
Jon
