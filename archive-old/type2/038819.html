Well that red oil light in the instrument cluster is usually a clue.  It
should come on before the engine is turned over, and stay off when the
engine is running.  When it comes on while driving, it means &quot;stop right
now!&quot;

Figure about $1500 for a new long block and misc. parts.  About four hours
of labor (perhaps more) to install it at whatever is the going rate.

Or, do it yourself for the same parts cost, takes a full weekend (or two) 
to do
right (you'll do a better job than a mechanic) and you'll get a full
education in the workings of your bus.

Good Luck!

PS, don't even start the new engine without the oil light working
properly!
