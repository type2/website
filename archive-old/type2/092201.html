Subject: Re:76 can't have hydraulics if original

Regarding the 76 bus and why I said it couldn't have had hydraulics-, I
said this because he implied it had its original engine:

Vanagon man wrote:
&quot;The motor is a type 4, 2l with hydro lifters. It only has 50,000 actual 
miles on it, not rebuilt and not removed from the bus since it's
original 
installation.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; Totally possible someone did a motor swap and put a 2liter in the bus...
&gt; Rare to find original engines in these old cars.
