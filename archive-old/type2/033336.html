&gt; Ok, ok -- what's all this math that you guys are doing? I understand
&gt; that in 185R14, the R stands for the width of the tire and the 14 is the
&gt; size of the rim so the 185 is the diameter of the tire, I presume, but
&gt; where are you getting these decimal numbers and what does it all mean???!!!

    WHOA....

    Let's start over...

    185 is the cross sectional width.  185mm from sidewall to sidewall at
proper inflation.
    R= radial tire

    14 is wheel diameter in inches

    tires without a percentage # are automatically 82%

    So the 185R-14 would otherwise read 185/82R-14.

    Then it really gets confusing when you start looking at &quot;rolling diameter&quot;
vs &quot;static diameter&quot;, Load ranges, sidewall &amp; tread plys, plus 1 &amp; plus 2
options, etc...

Having attended numerous schools put on by the many tire manufacturers while a
salesperson at Costco Wholesale club, I learned alot of good info.  One of the
many things that stuck in my mind is the fact that tires with the same size
designation are not always exactly the same (even within the manufacturers own
line) due to different contruction methods for passenger, LT (light truck), and
performance tires.

I still have a few books from Yokohama, Michelin, and Uniroyal that explain the
differences and give stats on things like: revs per mile, rolling/static
diameters, etc...

During the time I worked at Costco I was the only one who actually cared enough
to learn manufacturer recommended exchange sizes.

For VW Busses and Vanagons with OE 185R-14, both LT195/75R-14 and 205/70R-14 C
load range are acceptable upgrades.  I ran Yokohama y356 205/70HR-14 C load
range tires on my '85 Vanagon GL weekender for 5 years and 64K miles without
any problems at all.  Vehicle was a daily driver and used weekends for swap
meets where it was loaded to the roof with stuff to sell.

    just my $.02 worth...  &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;
