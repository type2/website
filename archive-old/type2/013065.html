Hello AC Lovers,

In case you need refrigerant and don't want to try the
R134A conversion, I've been hearing some good stories
about an R12 replacement refrigerant called FR12. 
It's made by Intercool and supposed to be a drop in
replacement for R12.  For some reason I can't find it
in Northern Virginia, but I understand it's popular in
sun belt areas like Texas, Georgia, and probably
Florida.  Anyone have any experience with it, or know
a cheap supplier up North?

Rob
