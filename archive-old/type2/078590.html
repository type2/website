Three responses in one:

As what to do about a daily driver you want to paint:

Just keep driving it! This is bad I know. Don't really do what I did. The
pic is a camping trip 2 hours away we took while I was removing the old
paint.

A rattle can paint job was my only choice at the time because I removed
everything and then lost the money to get a real paint job..don't ask!
http://www.72camper_dot_com/colors.htm the rattlecan paint looks pretty
good...from far away. I plan to really paint my bus as soon as I am happy
with the mechanicals (new engine). But I smile every time I look at my bus
even when I see the funky paint.

There is a guy named Jim that came to Everybus last year. His bus is the
green/purple paint that changes color as you move around it. It cost him a
lot, but I don't remember how much. It was pretty cool.

&gt; &gt; &gt; What did you do about the really pitted parts, or did you have any?
I
&gt; &gt; &gt; can't see just grinding them all down because the sheet metal would
get
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I wire brush the pits to clean them out, then fill them in with
oxyacetylene
&gt; &gt; and MIG wire.
&gt;
&gt; another great tool is the 3M trico wheels on a power tool  I like the 6S
&gt; or 7S wheels...  probably have to get these from a hardware wholesaler.
&gt; I got mine from L.A. Benson in Baltimore, they do mail order.
