Subject: Loose #4 Exhaust valve?

Figured I would post an interesting occurence.  2
weeks ago I took my 75 to Assateague National Seashore
Md for a fishin/bachelor party trip.  Bus ran really
well, small exhaust leak.  Nearing home on the way
back lost considerable power, cough cough cough.  Took
Friday off to see if I could get it running well
again.  Adjust 1 and 2 no problem.  Pull the cover off
3 &amp; 4, #4 exhaust bolt and nut are just laying there! 
I adjust 3 and then fix 4.  Start up still not right. 
Adjust the timing, check dwell, fix a very low idle. 
We are in business.  Took about an hour and a half to
do.  Woo Hoo.  Took 6 people to see PHISH that night,
stuck in traffic forever, 95 degrees.  The bus
performed like a champ.  So my question is should I be
worried about #4.  I am considering letting the local
guru give the bus a tuneup and put on a new exhaust. 
Or should I just do it myself.  Big camping trip for
August to prepare for.  Give your bus a hug!
