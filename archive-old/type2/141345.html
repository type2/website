Subject: Re: [T2] Uniroyal Laredo All Season? - NOT a tire thread, just 
  help  needed

From Courtney:

OK, it is a Uniroyal AWF all season tire, Type C, 1435lb at 50psi, 195/75-14 6 ply tire.
How's that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------

AWF???  Does not show up anywhere..... AWP is probably what they are. 
From what you list, it appears to be the 1st tire listed here:
 http://www.tirerack_dot_com/tires/Spec.jsp?make=Uniroyal&amp;model=Laredo+All+Season+AWP

Type C has me puzzled with a weight rating of 1435.....  1435 is too low.
That is the range of passenger car tire weight. 
Minimum for your bus is 1540 lbs.
The 93 Load Index puts it at 1433 lbs.
Not sure about 90Q........If Q means speed rating, the max speed is 99 mph. 

6 ply is the tread area.  What is the sidewall rating?
