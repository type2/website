Subject: automatic tranny vacuum hose size

Well,

My subject says it all. I asked the question about
attaching the auto tranny vac. hose to the brake
booster hose with a &quot;T&quot;.  I was told to run both the
booster and transmission vac lines through the
firewall to the manifold. I have already ordered my
booster vac hose. What size vacuum hose do I need to
buy for the transmission? The P.O. had just used a
length of gas line that fit. I would need to know the
metric size and a possible standard size that would
fit. Thanks in advance! P.S. The brake booster uses a
1 way valve in the vac line. Should I install one in
the transmission vac line as well?

Thanks and take care!

Regards,
David Kelly
