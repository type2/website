Greg,

If your lead vehichle can handle it, get the auto transporter from U-haul. 
It's only $45 for a day, (unlimited miles) and you have all four wheels up
off the ground and no worries about ruining the bearings.  I used one for a
short (50 mile) transport and was much happier w/ the peace of mind that
this set up gave me.
