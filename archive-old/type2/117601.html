Subject: Re: [T2] foam under gas tank?

When I pulled the tank on my 78, the only foam was around the hole where 
the inlet and outlet for the FI system goes.  Underneath thetank was very 
pristine looking...the only thing I could think fo would be and sort of 
condensation formed from a full tank of cool gas bought on a hot muggy day 
and then parked.

I prefer to leave out anything that might collect and absorb water.

Cheers, dave

&gt; I removed the gas tank, (78 westy) and found the leak = old hoses for the vent

&gt; installation of foam under the tank?
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone shed some light on this?  There wasn't any there when I removed it.  I
&gt; have some 1/8&quot; thick rubber material.  should I put that under it where the
&gt; tan makes contact?
