&gt; ...Once you get much over 5,000 feet you'll probably notice
&gt; some power loss but you'll just have to go slower over those big
&gt; mountain passes. Be careful not to overrev the motor in a low gear.
&gt; Thats how the PO of my bus grenaded the motor driving over the
&gt; continental divide.

I'll second those observations. My field notes from the luvbus' honeymoon
cruise through the Rockies with my luvin' wife back in '95 include the
following: VERY noticeable loss of power at 9000' feet in N. New Mexico.
Based on inference from things written by John Muir, I advanced the timing
a few degrees (about 5, from 7.5 BTDC to 12? I forget) in an attempt to
compensate for altitude. Also switched to 87 octane gas (that was before I
learned that US and Euro octane measures are different and I thought I
needed to burn 91 octane to make my bus happy).

And then one fateful morning while charging up a steep Forest Service road
in the Wind River range, my crankshaft broke clean in half. I hate it when
that happens! Not only grenaded my engine, but also my torque converter
and automatic tranny. Our beloved bus gushed red ATF like a whale bleeding
grievously to death. A low compression test at first led me to believe I'd
burned valves and left me scratching my head when I got in there and the
valves looked fine. Mail ordering parts and rebuilding the engine in a
remote wood shed was a tale of triumph and failure, but that's another
story. If I knew then what I know now...

A number of people have told me that the crankshaft was &quot;just one of those
things,&quot; unrelated to the altitude or timing. But you're saying otherwise?
Just what is it about low compression plus high revving that might grenade
an engine?

Drive safely,
