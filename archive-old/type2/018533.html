Subject: A Child's Cot!  needed for '71 bus, las call!
Message-ID: &lt;3767EEBD.4E82_at_worldnet.att_dot_net&gt;

Would *reeeeely* like to obtain a child's cot for a '71 bus--what ever
will work, at a reasonable price.  Or even just the poles, at this late
date would be nice.  Anyone have one you wish to dicker about?

I am in southern Ca and would, of course, be willing to pay any and all
shipping and such.

It would be nice to have some storage up front under my son to stuff
things while we are sleeping in the van.

Thanks all,

Lauria Watts
