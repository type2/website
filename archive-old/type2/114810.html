Subject: RE: [T2] h2o cooled

Some have put them in the front of the bus, on the roof and directly behind
the motor (facing out)

 h2o cooled


My only question, and if someone could help me figure it out, I would 
appreciate it, is where would you put the Radiator, I figure you could use a

radiator cooler, but where do you put the radiator.. I want to invest in a 
VW Bus, but do not like air cooled engines, I want to convert the engine 
over to a jetta or scirrocco 8 valve water cooled engine. but haven't 
figured out where to put the radiator.. any suggestions? Appreciate it...
