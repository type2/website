Subject: Re: [T2] DIY Paint

Hi Matthew,

I have painted 2 buses with tremclad enamel using a brush and roller. 
Buy a gallon, it's cheaper than buying 2 quarts and you'll have lots 
left over for touch-ups and to colour-match your camping accessories.

I had &quot;Bob the Tomato&quot; painted at Maaco in 2001 because I didn't have 
time or space to do it myself at the time, it cost 3x as much and the 
paint is not that much better.

I have also seen the same tremclad enamel applied from rattle-cans. It 
goes on smoother, but costs a lot more this way. In either case, you 
have to be careful not too apply too much at a time or you will get 
runs and sags. Better to spray 3 light coats than one runny coat.

Priming and prep-work makes a HUGE difference in a cheap paint-job. 
Make sure to use a primer that is compatible with the paint you are 
using. Don't spend forever working on prep and driving around in 
primer, as the primer is porous and the bus will rust right through it 
after a few weeks. I primed over the bondo and repairs, but where the  
original paint was still good I just sanded it and wiped it with a rag 
dipped in thinner before painting.

Take the time before you paint to remove as much trim as possible-- 
door-handles, lenses, wipers, license plates, door-seals, bumpers, etc. 
Buy a NEW roll of masking tape and be as thorough as possible 
withmasking off everything else. Wipe up drips immediately, it's easier 
to do before it's dry and crusty. It'll take longer this wat, but it'll 
look MUCH better. If you can paint with the windows out (very easy to 
do with Jalousies, less so with the sides) the end result will be even 
better.

Paint the pop-top with Interlux Premium Yacht enamel. Available at 
better marine suppliers, a quart will cover the pop-top with 2 coats 
and leave enough to do the bumpers to match. I used a brush and roller 
on the pop-top and it turned out terrific.

Right now my wife and I are considering something cheap and effective 
for the 77 Sunroof Automatic, and the name Krylon come up...

Happy trails,

&gt; HI All-
&gt;
&gt; Without opening the can of worms as to whether-or-not a DIY paintjob is
&gt; &quot;right&quot; or not to do, what suggestions do those of you that have done 
&gt; this
&gt; have to offer?
&gt;
&gt; -What kind of paint did you use?
&gt; -Roller or Rattle Can?
&gt; -How much paint was required?
&gt; -Did you prime first?
&gt; -What about the poptop? Same stuff/technique?
