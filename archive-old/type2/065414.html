Subject: Vegas Bug-in Report

Well, since I ventured from here in SLC down to Vegas for the 
weekend, I thought I'd best post a little report on the 3rd annual 
Bug-in.

My friend and I and his girlfriend traveled down for Vegas for the 
weekend, to take a break and of course attend the Bug-in on Sunday 
morning.

We arrived at the show at about 8:00am and things were WELL underway. 
The temparature was already on its way to nearly 100, and every bit 
of it was felt on the pavement.  To my surprise they were charging a 
HEFTY $10 entry fee for spectators (I am assuming it was free for 
those brave souls that arrived at 6:00am for the start of the swap 
meet).

The drag racer VW's were already lined up in the pits and ready to 
go.  Spontaneous revvs of loud engines was the order for the morning. 

We began to wander around looking for the show cars.  A large parking 
lot full of racing bugs, ghias, and one bus, and a slew of support 
vehicles greeted us (even one towing trailer that was fully 
carpeted!), but no show of classy vehicles was revealed.  

I was starting to get a bit worried, thinking to myself, &quot;have I 
driven 400 miles for naught?&quot;  At that moment when I mentioned my 
concern to my friend I saw a small sign declaring &quot;Show Cars -&gt;&quot;  It 
guided us to a hidden race oval that was a magnificant sea of fabulous 
Volkswagens!  My disappointment was replaced with the giddy 
excitedness of a five year-old on Chrismas morning!  We hurried down 
and started perusing the cars.  What a sight!

I was immediately drawn to a '57 Oval that is almost an identical 
twin to my '56.  It was the same powder blue color, and had a 
beautiful original interior.

There were plenty of busses, including a lime green &quot;hot vw&quot; sano 
that had PERFECT body work.  Better I'm sure than came from the 
factory.  It even had a feature article that one of the rags had run 
on it.  It was immaculate, but sure could have used an original color.

I was also VERY impressed with a PERFECT Westy.  Probably a late 50-
early 60.  It had the entire interior and was to die for.  A 
beautiful sage green color.

There were also numerous other nice bugs and busses, and a couple of 
ghias and things.  And the obligatory &quot;Neuspeed&quot;-ed out Jettas.  
Whose likes looked so out of place it was funny.  No Type III's.  I 
had my heart set out to see a nice Type III Ghia, but none was to be 
found.  

I'll be putting together a web page with all of the photo's that my 
friend took as soon as they are developed.

And I did finally come to a consensus on what colors the singlecab 
will be.  Lotus White and Velvet Green.

Speaking of which who has the page with all of the color codes on it? 
I'm trying to find the codes for those colors.

We left before the races were over, since we wanted to get back up 
here before too late.  But in passing I'll mention the races; it was 
the first time I'd seen VW quarter mile stuff, and I was impressed.  
Someone had a 3000cc Turbo bug that did like 150 in 9 seconds.  I felt 
more in tune with the crazy guy that took his bus out there.  64 mph 
in like 20 seconds!  :)
