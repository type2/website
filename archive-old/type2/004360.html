	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Hey wilden1,
Go to my site at http://www.dropgates_dot_com and under the 'accessory' section
on page 4, I have a Bosch accessory installation manual scanned. Lots of
wiring diagrams, bracket plans, and so forth in that manual. Should have
eveything you need.

&gt;I have a set of Bosch lights, one is a high powered driving light and the
&gt;other is a wide beam fog light.
&gt;Has anybody got the wiring diagram for these lights ?
&gt;I have the OEM VW Dash switch that goes in the instrument cluster. The
&gt;switch has two positions like the headlight switch has for park light and
&gt;headlights.
&gt;I've got the lights working but I know that the repay is not correctly
&gt;wired because both lights come on.
&gt;The proper wiring will give me one fog light in center position on the
&gt;switch and high power driving light in the full on position.
&gt;The relay has numbered terminals but the switch does not.
&gt;Very confusing. I've blown about a half dozen fuses trying various
&gt;hookups and have stopped because I don't want to blow out this rare and
&gt;probably expensive switch.
&gt;I can't go by color codes because this was added to the original vehicle
&gt;after delivery, i just put it in the same way it came out since the
&gt;colors of the wires don't correspond with any schematics I have.
