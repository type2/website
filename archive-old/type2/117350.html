&gt; this many, many times. The only decent electric solutions I've heard

I got one of the blankets at a pretty good price from a truck stop

&gt; The stock location for a gas heater is in the engine compartment (BN-4) 
&gt; or under the cargo floor (BA-6).  The engine compartment location is 
&gt; easier to install into but it doesn't do much to heat the drivers 
&gt; compartment. I have successfully fitted a BN-2 (Beetle) heater under 
&gt; the floor of the bus inline with the main heater pipe, this gave 
&gt; excellent heat to the defroster vent and to heat the drivers 
&gt; compartment. Look in the library, there is lots of info on this.

I have mounted a BA-4 under the front of the bus where the A/C buses put
an evaporator (or is it the condenser??) with air recycled from the
passenger comp.   details should be in the archives
