&gt;  Sounds like the pin in the ball at the base of the stick may have come out 
/
&gt;  sheared off.  To check, undo the 2 bolts at the floor and pull the whole
&gt;  thing out.  Poking out of the front of the ball should be a pin about 1/8&quot;
&gt;  diameter (you may have to scrape some grease off to see).  If this pin 
isn't
&gt;  there, the whole stick will be able to swivel round.  If it's not fixable,
&gt;  you should be able to get a stick from a junkyard.

Hi Dave, Isaiah and 'the list'

What Dave suggests above may well be correct, but all may not be lost...

Some years back I changed to a Scat shifter, then changed back because 
although I liked it (except it was cold in winter) my gear box did not. By 
the time I changed back I had completely lost the pin and spring through that 
goes through the ball at the bottom of the gear stick.

So I take a 6mm diameter bolt and holding it in vice grips (to protect my 
fingers) I ground down the head of the bolt so instead of being hexagonal it 
is a smaller circle - small enough to fit in the recess for the original pin 
head.

Then just popped it in and it worked a treat. because I didn't have a spring 
fitted it was actualy easier to fit!

Also in the past others on the list have experienced the bracket holing the 
front of the shift rod onto the underside of the van floor coming off which 
would have a similar effect - and may cause the loss of the pin anyway.

Good luck
