Subject: Re: [T2] [Friday] Make your own bus!

&gt; Ah the colorful 70's. I'm not responsible - - I was too young...

I have similar 'issues' with plaid. I got to wear my cousins plaid
hand-me-downs in the late 70s-early 80s when plaid was out of style - at least
the colors of plaid I was having to wear...

-Eric
