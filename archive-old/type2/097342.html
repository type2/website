Subject: 73 Westy with 2.0 engine &amp; other parts, may consider selling
  engine seperately

I'm getting ready to move soon and unfortunately I have to sell 73 Westy
project.  The body on the bus is good.  The fees are current.  Also included
with the bus is a complete 2.0 engine from a 76 bus with manifolds and
injectors, fuel injection computer, fuel tank from the 76 (fuel injection tank
with the port for the return line),  fuel injection fuel pump, air cleaner,
heat exchangers, a complete dash from a 71 bus, 4 or 5 extra bus wheels, an
extra set of bus front seats, extra engine cover, and some other small parts
that I'm going to pull out of my storage unit and throw in with the deal.  I
believe there are some extra fuel injection parts in there and some other
pieces.  I'm asking $950.00 or best offer for everything.  I might be willing
to sell the engine or other parts separately.  Email me for pictures or with
any questions you might have.  Make an offer if you are interested.
