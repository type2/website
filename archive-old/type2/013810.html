Subject: Front tranny mount

Could someone enlighten me as to the proper front mounting bracket
for my tranny?  It just doesn't look right.  No rubber buffers, no
beefy carrier plate like the one pictured in Bentley...just a thin
U-shaped bracket held on by two 17mm bolts about an inch and a half
long.  I got a carrier plate from the junk yard, along with the
rubber buffers, but I just couldn't get the pieces to fit.  Also the
bolts were about three inches long.  The picture of the carrier plate
in RMMW catalog shows a flat plate, the one I got from the junk yard
and the one pictured in Bentley is U-shaped.  Can anyone help?
