Subject: Re: Van Break in

Hi Sam,

You're right, but you're missing the point of the original post,  
which was asking how to prevent the damage done to the vehicle during  
the break-in. Leaving that vehicle unlocked would have prevented that  
damage, which was of a much higher cost than the stereo they were after.

Perhaps the post should have read &quot;Locks only keep &quot;Theft of  
opportunity&quot; from occurring. There's simply no stopping a well- 
prepared and determined thief. They'll haul the whole vehicle away if  
the stakes are high enough. And I have heard of dumb_at_$$ thiefs who  
broke the windows on an unlocked car to get inside.

Leaving the keys in the ignition is another matter though.... Might  
as well put a sign on it saying &quot;Free ride&quot;.\

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; Honest people don't try to get into any car, locked or unlocked, that
&gt; isn't theirs.
&gt;
&gt; Unlocked cars make your car more likely to be the target of crime.
&gt;
&gt; Many times I have read or seen interviews with convicted or former car
&gt; break in &quot;artists&quot; included in crime prevention features.  They state
&gt; that they often would just walk along checking cars and go into the  
&gt; ones
&gt; that were unlocked to do their stealing, or find ones unlocked and  
&gt; with
&gt; the keys inside in plain view to steal.
&gt;
&gt; They were amazed, as law enforcement people continue to be, that so  
&gt; many
&gt; people would leave their cars unlocked or &quot;with keys&quot; making it so  
&gt; easy
&gt; for the thief.
&gt;
&gt; While not all thieves operate in this manner, and some do break into
&gt; vehicles, not locking the vehicle is just an invitation to become a
&gt; victim.  Leaving things of value in plain sight is another.
