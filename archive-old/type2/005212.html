And if you're going to be doing any fuseholder cleaning, etc., disconnect
the battery first so you don't fry all your wires and connections.  It's
almost impossible to poke around much in that area without causing an
unintentional short circuit.

Then when you turn things on to check the results of your work and nothing
happens, remember your battery is not connected :-)

&gt;&gt;  I'd recommend replacing all the fuses with new and making sure that
there is good spring pressure on the fuses before further troubleshooting.
These fuses tend to corrode and make poor connections.  &lt;&lt;
