Subject: speedometer error

&gt;Early bay window Busses will not accurately 
&gt;report your speed if you put 185R14C tire on. ... 
&gt;Eventually VW changed the tranny to make things
right.

Could someone explain how changing the transmission
could effect the speedometer reading. I thought all
bays drive the speedo from the left front wheel.
