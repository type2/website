Hello,

I checked the archives and the library to no exact avail.
the locks (pretty much all) are seized and under the control of some one
other than me. I got a new stereo system installed and it could get
stolen easily if I don't figure out these locks quick. I'd like to rekey
them w/o paying any one. when I bought the bus I got 4 keys lord knows
what they actually go to....
