&gt;We'd get one side in and t'other side would just pop out. Really has us

&gt;a nice warm day in SoCal, so the seal should've been soft enough.

I just got through doing the same thing to both rear windows (I now have a
single piece of glass in the left rear also).  Had no trouble at all - the
seals went in easily.  Maybe Wolfsburg West gave you a bum seal?  I got
mine from the Bus Depot.  The first one was beautiful, the second had
abrasions on the outer the surface as if it had been sanded with 40 grit
sandpaper in places - no good for a concours restoration but okay for my
bus - too much trouble to return for a minor (to me) detail.  Anyway, the
price was right, the fit was great and no leaks in some really hard rain
since I installed them.  I suggest you return the seal and get one from Bus
Depot.
