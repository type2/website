&gt; A few years(maybe more than a few) ago there was a vendor advertising in Hot
&gt; VW's Magazine that offered a Wide-5 disc brake kit for bays that had vented

&gt; haven't seen 'em advertised since.  ANybody else know what I'm talking
&gt; about?  Anybody order from them?

Was it Old Speed in CA?
