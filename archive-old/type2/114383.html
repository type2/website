Subject: RE: [T2] Differences from vw pancake to Porsche 914 pancake

In all, I probably spent about $3500. I did a full teardown and rebuild
of the Corvair engine. If one found a engine and tranny on good
condition, one could probably do the swap themselves for maybe $2500. It
all depends on getting lucky on the parts. There's a pretty large
Corvair enthusiasts group out there. Parts and support are a-plenty
(.... but not as a-plenty as those VW nuts)

&quot;Considering that the flat-six was used in the 911, you are dead-on
there. A
much more spendy option, in fact, is to put the Porsche flat-six in the
bus.
Of course, a solid 911 engine will set you back $3K-$5K minimum.&quot;
