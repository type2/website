Subject: Re: [T2] 1978 T2

Terry,

I can't agree on this one....here's why...

To me, a body in good shape is a *find*.  I can fix just about anything=20
mechanical, but the bodywork/paint is what is expensive for me.

My 78 Champagne edition that is getting painted(professionally) right now
but has horrible compression...around 70# on #1 and 3 and 130# on 2 and 4.

It will still cruise the freeway at 75+mph and get around town fine.
Once it is painted and the windows and interior restored(parts on the way=
=20
now), I will rebuild the engine this fall and winter.

So, as Chris said...what's good for someone else may not be good for me.
If you are a professional painter, then a bus in great mechanical=20
condition but crappy body would be good for you, but not good for me.

A new bus is an adventure....enjoy the trip!

Cheers, dave

&gt; What ever you do prior to even thinking of purchasing this Bus--do buy,
&gt; rent, steal,or borrow a compression tester.
&gt; This will on test tell you more than maybe possibly anything else on the
&gt; engines overall condition.
&gt; Low or no compression---forget it, unless of course your into engine /
&gt; head rebuilds.
&gt; Good compression---it may be a buyer---depending on the overall
&gt; condition of the Bus, and the mood you happen to be in that moment---you
&gt; have to lay out the cash for the purchase price.

&gt; Hello Friends,
&gt; I'm new to the vintage VW scene and need a little assitance. I'm looking
&gt; at and have put money down on a 1978 Type 2 with the 2.0 engine. The
&gt; body is fairly good with minimal rust and the driver side door replaced.
&gt; Chassis rust is non existent and over-all it looks like a pretty clean
&gt; vehicle. I did give it a test drive which went well, tranny seemed fine
&gt; and although it drifted a little it drove fairly well. (I don't have
&gt; anything to base that on since it was the first one I've driven.) The
&gt; one thing that I neglected to do that's worrying the heck out of me was
&gt; a compression test. There was also a small leak out of the left side of
&gt; the engine which I'm told is probably the oil cooler. No leak while
&gt; idling but after running on the freeway for 1/2 hour it dripped for
&gt; about 3 min. a puddle a little larger than a quarter, then stopped.
&gt; =A0=A0=A0=A0Is there any way that I can figure out from driving it how
&gt; good or bad the compression is? It seemed to have fairly decent power
&gt; took a little while to get up to sixty but like I said I don't have
&gt; anything to base that on. Should I be worried and do a compression test?
&gt; Any advice on the oil leak?
&gt; Thanks, peace,
&gt; Giles
