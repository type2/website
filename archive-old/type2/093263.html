Subject: Re: [T2] Starter Wont Do its Job


&gt;             I have a 78 westy currently in the process of being put back 
&gt; on the road. I purchased it after it had sat for about 5 years. I've 
&gt; straightened out all the normal problems,bad gas clogged injection, etc. 
&gt; I have gotten the bus to run and have been able to drive it. The problem 
&gt; is sometimes the ignition switch will not trigger the starter. This seems 
&gt; to happen almost at random. The switch will only turn over the starter 
&gt; about 1 in 20 times. I have replaced my battery terminals and wires, 
&gt; cleaned every contact on the starter, checked for voltage at the starter, 
&gt; and everything seems ok. is their something I don't know about the 
&gt; solenoid that I should take into account? Any possible information or 
&gt; things to try would be greatly appreciated. Thanks

Had a '72 Super Beetle (Italian Spec as I was living in Italy) that 
developed this problem and I had to replace the ignition switch. The little 
nylon nubs that the key housing pushed against finally got worn down to 
nothing.
