Subject: Do T3 brake calipers fit on a T2?

Last week it was time for the annual savetyinspection of my 1971
panelvan again....but it failed. There was a nice list of technical
breakdowns...no welding fortunately.

One of the points was &quot;deteriorated discbrakes&quot; and one stuck brake
caliper. Since the brake system on this vehicle is modelyear '71-'72
only everything is very hard to get and also twice as expensive as the
'73-'79 stuff. So I am thinking of 'upgrading' the discbrakes to the
newer version. I have a complete 1978 front axle but the brakesystem on
it looks horrible. The discs are very rusty and so do the calipers.

I looked in the VW parts catalog ('ETKA') and when I look up brake
calipers for a 1978 bus it gives this articlenr:

  251 615 107

This is a T3/Vanagon partnr. There is also a remark with this item: &quot;See
repairmanual 47/08 1981 for details&quot;. So I guess something needs to be
modified if I want to apply a T3 caliper. Does anyone know what this
modification could be? Does anyone on the list have experience on using
T3 brake calipers on a T2?

The reason I am thinking about the T3 calipers is because I can find the
T3 on basically every junkyard. The T2 is virtually extinct.
