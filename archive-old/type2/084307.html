Subject: Today i started the bus, and it didn't like me at all

So, I just put on my new head, and it went together pretty well without 
pulling the engine.  Also gave it new plug wires, and a couple other 
little things, like viton tube seals and a cv boot.  

    Started it up, and it was loud and smokey, but that was to be 
expected, i thought.  Two things... one, my oil cooler leaks like a 
faucet.  The other is that it won't drop idle, and it smokes smokes 
smokes.  Oil in the exhaust smoke, it is.  

    So, first, can i replace my oil cooler without pulling the engine? 
 Second..... well, i kinda know what to do about the smoke and the bad 
running.  I'll do a compression test to see if i burned a ring, make 
sure all my cylinders are firing and all that stuff.  I just wanted to 
say something about it, because it makes me want to cry, really.  It's 
been in the garage since april, and i'd really like to drive it.  It's 
almost to the point where i'm thinking of taking it to the import joint 
and seeing what they think it is....  Any support, comments, suggestions 
would be appreciated.
