Subject: Re: [T2] Flatbed tower in the DC area?

Where about is Brunswick and where exactly does it need to go to? I have a
tow dolly and a hitch on my bus ... I am in College Park.

From: &quot;Blissful Bus&quot; &lt;blissfullycrusin_at_gmail_dot_com&gt;

So can anyone suggest someone who would be willing to tow the bus from
Brunswick Md to Washington DC?
Thanks in advance!
