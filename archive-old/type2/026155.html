Last night I went out to check that my chokes were adjusted right (it's
getting cold here).  While I was about it, I thought I'd check the
solenoids, remembering the recent posts about them.  Imagine my surprise
when I found that the idle cutoff solenoid wasn't even finger tight.  I
wrapped some PTFE tape round the threads and put it back in.  Why isn't
there a gasket or o-ring on this thing?  And how are you supposed to get a
17mm wrench on it without dropping the engine?  There's probably a special
tool for it.
