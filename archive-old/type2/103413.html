Subject: Re: [T2] &quot;Hooverizing&quot;  my new jugs

I don't see what your problem is with the hover
treatment it's not hard, wash the piston &amp; cyl in
kerosene(take the rings off and clean the groves well
with a brush), rinse in mineral spirits, air dry, tape
off &amp; paint. done in about a hour. Been doing it this
way for thirty years, but hover is right clean, clean,
clean. Phil (WD-40 is a kero base cleaner)
