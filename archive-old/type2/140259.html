Subject: Need help tuning dual carbs

Hello volks,  I need some help tuning in my new Kadron 40mm dual carbs. They
were pre jetted by AJ Simms at aircooled_dot_net They hooked up nice. I just can't
get them tuned in right.  First and foremost. The timing was correct(8* at
idle, 28* full advance) when I had the old carb(single progressive) on. I
didn't set the timing then, it was done by a mechanic. I am trying to get into
taking care of my Bus myself now. So, it's a learning process. The timing
wasn't set when I put the new carbs on. I was hoping it would be from from the
previos adjustment.  With the new carbs, does the timing need set again? Is
the timing(8* idle and 28* full advance) still going to be the same?

Okay, just assuming that the timing is on, here's my problems with the carbs.
There is a black smoke at idle and when I accelerate, coming out the exhaust.

I read that if the carbs are set too lean, they'll detonate, making a popping
sound. Now if I have them running too lean(not enough gas), why do I smell a
rich fuel smell? I checked for fuel and air leaks. None found.

Help me along please and hopefully I'll soon become my own mechanic. Thanks!
