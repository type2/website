Subject: Generator ect.. Replaced

Hey Todd/List,
                  I've already pulled my engine and replaced my
generator. The
fan was moving side to side and starting to make noise. I'm doing it now
cause
school starts in a week and I won't have time to do it. I also put new
seals on
the intake manifold
due to a slight leak. Currently I'm waitng for Monday so I can buy a new
clutch
cross bar and seals. The bushing's hole where the lock nut goes through
had
ovaled out so the throw out bearing wasn't aligned with the pressure
plate. It
totaled the throw out bearing and was making lots of noise. I also
corrected the
flywheel end play which was closer to .006 than .004, hopefully my
bottom end
will last through the next 2yrs of school till I've got some cash to
overhaul
it. I did the top end, heads, pistons and cylinders last Oct. If
anyone's ever replaced the shift coupling I wouldn't mind hearing about
it, my shifting's a bit loose. Also if anyone's got flaps and a
thermostat  kicking around I wouldn't mind throwing some on my engine
before winter hits.
Later.
