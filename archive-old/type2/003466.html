I recently cleaned and rebuilt all the locks on the '81 as they were acting
up in similar manners, the passenger side totally seized and unturnable.  Of
course I'll note all should still lock from inside, an inconvenience but if
at least the drivers side works, OK.  Now the neat thing here is that the
Vanagon cylinders have a number of &quot;improvements&quot; and I use that very
loosely compared to the Bus that should help longetivity.  The cylinder body
is O-ringed in the handle to prevent water from corroding the lock.
Basically though first thing to try for someone not at all wanting a
challenge is spray WD-40 into the cylinder through the flapper.  Let it
soak, try to get it going, let is soak some more, try again.  If this
doesn't help and it probably wont, dissasembly is required.  This is
unfortunately very tough on the Vanagon lock.  The problem is first you must
physically remove the handles (a couple of screws from basically the door
frame side, but you might have to remove the interior panels to get all, I
had them off to replace so don't recall if I needed them off or not.  But to
get the cylinders out of the handles, unlike the Bus which simply uses 1
screw, the Vanagon has tiny pins that must be punched out to remove the
little toggle thingy that engages the lock mechanism.  Very tiny pins, I
ended up grinding a small drill off flat to use as a punch.  Then you have
to get the cylinder out which typically involves inserting the key and
pulling it out, unfotunately if terribly corroded as mine were you can't get
the brass sliders down to get out of the housing, a number of small
screwdrivers and picks worked for me.  Then I pried all the sliders out
(keeping them in order) beadblasted the housing, cylinder housing,
reassembled with drastic quantities of moly grease and all was well.  Entire
process took about an hour a side, but I knew what I was doing pretty much,
this probably isn't a novice job.  You might merely remove the handles and
take them to a locksmith and see if they can get them apart and cleaned up.
Or if the WD-40 frees them up, follow with some moly spray lube or lithium
spray grease, and be happy for a couple of years.  My '81 was a beach Van
and I think being near salt water caused these as well as a number of other
problems.
