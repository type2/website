&gt; Why isn't temp a relative constant?

Well, because it isn't.  Others have said the reasons are complex and I
would add that they are also chaotic in the mathematical sense. The
behavior of chaotic systems is beyond prediction by man or ape and arguing
that old volkswagen buses are NOT chaotic systems is a pointless and
fruitless enterprise.  As Igor would say, &quot;The way to 'test the
proposition' is to slap it on the slab and run a good thick bolt of
lightning through it.&quot;  In this case that means putting an oil temperature
gauge in your bus and taking it on a drive.

I have found that different buses react to engine RPM differently.  I
believe that fuel mixture, state of tune and engine, and oil weight are
the predominating factors in heat generation.  I also believe that
cleanliness of engine and sealing of the tinware are major factors on the
cooling side.  The balance between them is delicate but in my experience
the more RPMs you run the greater the heat.  This is true whatever the
gear.  If you sit in your driveway and start your bus MOST buses will run
cooler at 800 RPM than at 200RPM without ever putting it in gear.  If you
are pulling a mountain grade and have to shift into third because it has
dropped to 40 in fourth you will quickly overheat the engine if you pull
back up to 50 even though the dots on the speedometer say you can do that
speed in third.

                             OOK!
