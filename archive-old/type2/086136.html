Subject: RE: [T2] RE: Mexican hatch seal

&gt; I recently purchased what was advertised as a &quot;German rear hatch
&gt; seal&quot; on an auction site. Bsed on the descriptions of the Mexican seal
&gt; I would say the one I got is indeed a German-made seal. It does have
&gt; molded corners that are flattened to fit the contours of the hatch. It
also
&gt;  has the correct bends for the beltline area midway down the hatch.
&gt; It is composed of 3 or 4 molded sections glued together end to end.
&gt; I haven't installed it yet, but comparing it to the original that's in
&gt; there, I would say it's CLOSE to identical. The quality of the
&gt; original seal looks to be better



I would seriously doubt that this is really a German VW seal, but it may
well be genuine VW.  For a number of years, VW has been selling Brazilian
made seals, even in Germany itself.  I have seen them sold, and even
labeled, as &quot;made in Germany&quot;, but they are in fact not.  I think one
importer may have bought some in Germany and erroneously assumed that they
were German made, not realizing that they were simply VW/Brazil seals
exported to Germany.  They are, however, closer to original than Mexican
aftermarket seal, despite where they're made.  In fact they are exactly as
you describe above: correct corners, etc., close to original quality but not
quite. They are the ones used on the Mexican and Brazilian busses.  I list
them as &quot;genuine VW&quot; but do not claim them to be German because I know
better.  There is also an actual German made seal available in Europe, which
I import from time to time.  This one is apparantly made by the one-time OEM
supplier to VW but is not a &quot;genuine VW&quot; seal (since the &quot;genuine&quot; ones are
in fact no longer German).  I have seen no significant difference in quality
between these and the Brazilian made genuine VW ones, and often I do
substitute one for the other based on availability.  I have not seen these
ones anywhere else in the U.S., at least so far; most of what I've seen
elsewhere are either aftermarket Mexican seals or the aforementioned
errantly labeled &quot;German VW&quot; ones.
