Subject: free middle seat:)

hey everybody,
ive had this seat at my parents place back east for
ever.   i beleive its a 3/4 middle seat, it has the
armrest on the right hand side and the ash tray on the
back, with an 'oh sh#t' handle next to it.   it is the
black basket weave material in good condition except
for a tear that is located on the left corner of the
seat itself, when it is positioned against the side of
the van it is not really noticeable.   i got this seat
out of a barn and actually had it in my old dodge van
when i went cross country a few years back.   the van
has come and gone, but the seat is still around.   so
anyone who wants it, its yours free of charge just
like i got it.   only kicker is its too big for my
parents to mess with for shipping so you'd have to
pick it up.   they are located in upstate ny, just
outside of ithaca, which is about an hour from
syracuse.   anyone out there interested let me know by
pmail and ill get you directions etc, maybe i can even
get you a quick meal from my parents pizza place if
your travelin to get it.
thanks
