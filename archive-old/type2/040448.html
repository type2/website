Subject: Engine binds after reinstall: was Re: too much oil #2 - long

Did you turn engine during reinstall?  This is SOP to make sure you
didn't bind the clutch in some way- you turn the engine as you push it
in to join the splines of trans to clutch disk.  If it turned before,
you likely bound something on reinstall.
   BTW, I'd have done a compression check before the engine pull if it
was turning freely.
