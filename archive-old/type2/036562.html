Subject: Full width bed questions

I've seen a few buses that have rear folding beds that are as wide as the bus 
(read: no closet in the traditional position).  Were these beds available on 
specific models only?  Specific years? Were they a special order item?

There's a TON of junk yards here in So Cal I can check if I knew what years 
to look for.  Also I'd have a better chance finding one on line if I knew 
more about them.

Sorry if some of these questions sound a bit retarded, but I'm not too 
current with my trivia.

On that note? anyone have a full width rear bed/seat they'd be willing to 
sell?  Cushion condition is irrelevant, but I'd prefer a solid base.  I'm 
willing to travel....anywhere in CA south of say Santa Rosa and east all the 
way to Phoenix is within reason

Any help appreciated
