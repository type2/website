Subject: Found A Sidewinder Logo On My 79

Hi
After working long and hard trying to remove years of grime and road gunk
off my bus' body... I notice a faded logo over the driver side rear wheel
fender flare... it says Sidewinder and has some kind of large wheels in a
cartoon type drawing next to it.  I've heard of a sidewinder missle.. and
even Mallory Sidewinder Battery Connector Wires and ignition wires from
Mallory (I used to be a muscle car nut), but I've never heard of a
Sidewinder as a specialized accessory or upgrade component on a bus... Has
anyone?  Please enlighten me... Oh yeah.. I did search the archives...
Thanks in advance for your responses....
