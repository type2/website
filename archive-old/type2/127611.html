&gt; I'm trying to find TDC on Cyl. #1 so I can be sure I'm doing my dizzy
&gt; work right. I popped off the valve cover to watch the valve train open
&gt; and close stuff. I THOUGHT you could tell the compression stroke by
&gt; see'ing when BOTH valves were closed. 

try this. pull off both valve covers. Turn the crank to where the #1
piston is near it's top. You can use a pencil in the spark plug hole
to help make sure. This is TDC. Now look at the valves of #1, while
moving the crank forward/backward about 20 degrees. Do the valve move?
if not look over at #3. If #3 move &amp; #1 don't you are at TDC of the #1
compression stroke. However if the valves on #1 move &amp; #3 remain in
place just rotate the crank 360 degrees.

&gt; But once I looked, it seems that
&gt; they BOTH open and close every 180. Also, on my fan, I have the red
&gt; painted line, then another line 180 on the other side with a painted
&gt; line on it too. ONE of the painted lines is over a filed notch. 

I would suspect the notch is the correct one, but verify first.

&gt; My questions
&gt; 1.   Is the notch factory or PO made?

both my buses have a notch so it could easily be

&gt; 2.   If the notch is Factory, is THAT the mark for TDC of the
&gt; compression stroke? 

probably, but remember the crank can be aligned at TDC of the
compression stroke &amp; TDC of the gas expel/intake. so you need to
verify with valves. Also if installed correctly your distributor rotor
should point toward the small notch on the distributor if at #1 TDC
compression stroke

&gt; 3.   How do I tell witch is the compression stroke? 

see above, but think of it this way. if any of the valves are open
during the compression stroke, how could it compress the air/gas
mixture? 

good luck.
