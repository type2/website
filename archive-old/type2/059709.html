Subject: Cable clutch lever for '81???

       Just discovered that the clutch shaft lever on the 090
bellhousing out of my '81 is a bit larger than that of the '73 002
bellhousing it's replacing --- thus the cable clutch lever I need to put
on there doesn't fit. It had a hydraulic clutch lever on there.
       So is there a cable clutch lever to fit the later shaft, or am I
shafted???
