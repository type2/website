It reduces the lateral shock that you will feel in your steering
wheel when you hit a bump or pothole in the road.  I've never had to
replace one on my bus; however, I used to have to replace them on my
67 Beetle about every 40,000 miles.  They usually fail quickly once
they start to go.

&gt;
&gt;Dumb question, but I want to know the answer and can't find it in a 
&gt;book.
&gt;
&gt;What does the horizontal shock absorber thing on the steering do ? I 
&gt;think
&gt;its the steering damper.
&gt;
&gt;What happens if it's not working ? How long does it last ? I've never
&gt;replaced on one of either my bus or bug. Should I ?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks
