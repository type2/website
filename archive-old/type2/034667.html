&gt;So aside from saying goodbye (till I get another bus somewhere down the

&gt;1.7L. From what I understand, my tranny is geared lower, right?

Yup.  Final drive on his is 4.57 and yours is 5.375.  That means that where
he was going 60mph before he will only be going 51mph if he uses the 72
tranny.

&gt;Aside from
&gt;engine sizes and carb vs FI, what are the major differences? I mean, what
&gt;will he have to change to make the swap? If he'd rather keep his tranny, is
&gt;there much to do to to make it fit in the 72?

The bellhousing goes with the engine.  If he only uses your engine, he
should take the bellhousing from your trans and use that with it.
