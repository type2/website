Subject: RE: [T2] PLFVW and Poptop Canvas

&gt; I was planning to get canvas for my 71 sportsmobile top 
&gt; through PLFVW.  Is there any other source for this type 
&gt; of canvas?  Ron, do you sell it at BD?


As far as I know Dawn is the only one making replacement tents for the
Sportsmobiles and ASI/Rivieras. My suppliers don't, as they are in Europe
and these U.S. conversions were never sold there.
