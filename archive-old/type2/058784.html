Subject: Missing Exhaust Studs

My copper manifold/exhaust and new muffler gaskets came yesterday, so last
night was time to put the heat exchangers/muffler back on and see if my new
exhaust bolts would hold torque. The heat exchangers went back on a lot easier
than they came off. 

The fact that one copper gasket was gone and 3 studs missing before, made a
major difference in the sound of the engine. With the new Empi &quot;monza&quot; exhaust
and everything torqued up--can you spell P-U-R-R. Took a quick spin around the
block around 9:30 pm and nobody had to yell out their window about the
racket--just smooth power! I'm just about ready to hit the road to fun and
adventure. Few more details like fuel lines, CV boots/grease and I'm about
there.

Made sure to re-attach all the hanging straps for the heat exchangers which
the PO's mechanic had left off to protect the new tight connection on the HEs.
There is a lot of weight on those 8 little studs--I can't imagine anybody lazy
enough to not hook back up the support straps. Since the Empi has no support
on it, I'm thinking about rigging a big hose clamp from the pipe going into
the muffler up to the engine support bar or some other strong place. Anybody
done this?
