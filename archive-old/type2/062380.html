Subject: URL of Fire Hazard Report (The Junkyard)

 Several people responded about the FireHazard in late type 2's I forwarded
from a website-got it from a link at this address:
http://www.acvwjyro_dot_com/acvwjy/auntmary.htm
  The JunkYard seems to be a parts source that included the Hazard story
(the loose brass tube in non FI fuel pumps) &amp; (the gas tank/filler pipe
rubber connection)- a bus burned up because of the latter
   In an earlier post I mentioned the cracking of this connector, and using
silicone to glop all over it.  Another poster mentioned a replacement
radiator hose piece from auto supply place will work, but I question if
such rubber is gas resistant?  The dealer wants $90 for a 4&quot; long piece of
hose!. Bus Boys, you said this could be fabricated??
