Subject: Re: [T2] Overhead net

&gt;I was looking through an old beetle accessory catalog (online) and saw a
&gt;great idea: an overhead net for the cab to hold maps etc. Has anyone seen
&gt;one for sale? I just might try to make one.

Just check the local motorcycle shops - they have alot of nice little nets. 
I get them there for my motorcycle and my cars.


Ciao!
