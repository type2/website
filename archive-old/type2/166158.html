&gt;&gt; Is it ok to use these plugs (wr7dc+)?  I just picked them up and I 
&gt;&gt; wanted to make sure they're ok in my 78 bus.  I couldn't find any 
&gt;&gt; reference to them in the library.
&gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Search the archives instead.

Did that too.. and might I mention, the archive search engine is not 
particularly useful.  Isn't there a free google search that can be used 
or something.  I have never found anything useful using the archive search.

anyways, I brought them back to my mechanic and he swapped 'em out for 
w8cc plugs instead.

Thanks!
