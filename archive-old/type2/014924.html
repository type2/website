Subject: Looking for some parts...
Message-Id: &lt;3.0.1.16.19991105105833.28df5da4_at_mail2.spsu_dot_edu&gt;

A friend is looking for some parts for his '72 Westy and the VW Dealership 
did not want to help him...

What he is looking for are:

211 609 831  Anchor pin-push bar from Ch. No. 2122000001
211 609 833  Spring clip-push bar from Ch. No. 2122000001

I tried a search on the Bus Depot site &amp; came up with nothing...
Anyone know a source so my friend can park on hills &amp; set his e-brake?

While we are at it, anyone know a source for:

211 259 157  Seal-Fresh air flap

Thanks for any help,

Dave
