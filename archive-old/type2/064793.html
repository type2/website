Aaron,

Hoping that Mr. Hoover writes and I am just adding a &quot;me too&quot;, let me say
that I do believe that you are on the right track.  Alas, new bushings
are, as far as I know, not available.  In addition, installation involves
pulling the engine/transmission, which may make it worth your while to put
up with the problem :-).  If you do want the problem fixed, you will have
to haunt junkyards and fine a nice shift rod, without knowing what one
looks like, which means finding and measuring half-a-dozen and picking the
best.  An all-round bummer, IMHO.  I have the same problem, and am
learning to live with it, given that I don't feel the alternatives are
viable options :-(
