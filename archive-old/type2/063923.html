     Wow!  Is it beautiful!  Several weeks ago Lea and I rode the Moto 
     Guzzi to a rally near Asheville, NC where we stumbled onto a '63 
     single cab for sale. After two weeks of thinking, negotiating, 
     rearranging finances, we got it!  Picked up Dave Easterwood saturday 
     afternoon and spent the night with Neil &amp; Mary Kay Pickett near 
     Asheville.  Neil is the NC NEATO guy and a gracious host.  Sunday morn 
     we spent 4 hours prepping the single cab for the ride home.  New 
     stabilizer, swapped distributor, adjust brakes, timing, some wiring, 
     new tires and back to Neil's house for burgers, beers, and fix the 
     wipers before heading home.  We had to bump start it twice on the way 
     home but other than that NOT a problem occurred!  We are very happy 
     and Lea is in love, nothing less.  The paint is turquoise and in  
     great shape. You have to look very hard to find rust, anywhere.  There 
     is a small amount of bondo in the rear.  One gate hinge needs fixing.  
     It is straight and mostly original, except for the motor which is a 
     '64 1500 SP.  Many heads were turned on the ride home, many waves, 
     peace signs, smiling faces.  My thanks to Dave and Neil for advice, 
     encouragement, parts, helping hands and beers.  You guys are great.
     
     Joel - add the '63 single cab to the stats if you please.
