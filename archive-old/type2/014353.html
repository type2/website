&gt; Hi Chuck,
&gt; I am getting ready to drop a new Mexican 1600dp in
&gt; my '67.  Is there
&gt; anything that you would have done different?  Did
&gt; you put in an oil temp
&gt; gauge or think it not neccessary?  Did you add an
&gt; oil filter kit?  I
&gt; appreciate your input.

I have had many people e-mail me directly regarding my
new Mexican VW engine since I posted about the valve
adjustments being right on...

Two years ago I paid 1250$ (the price has gone up
since then)for the engine and about 100$ freight. When
I ordered the engine, it was delivered the next
afternoon! Now thats service. I'm talking about a box
direct from VW with VW logos with an engine from the
factory. NEW VW. It came with a new flywheel already
on and a new doghouse style oil cooler. It is however
a Dual Port which I'm OK with. Hell, my 73 beetle
which I have owned for twenty years, has almost
200,000miles on the engine (never rebuilt)and is still
going strong, and it is a dual port.
I was looking for the best possible reliability I
could find, as we do take extended trips with my
family. What could be any better then a NEW engine
from VW.
I put on a new 34PICT3 carb (from Ronnie) and reused
all my other old parts off my worn engine. I have kept
everything totally stock and don't use an external oil
cooler or temp gauges, however it is a doghouse style
cooler, I do keep everything clean and in tune. My
engine starts at the first touch of the key always,
idles perfect and is very smooth. 
Ronnie was very helpful with all of this change to the
new engine and continues to be there whenever I need
him or his advice.
I put the engine in one week before we went on a three
week vacation From Reno to South Dakota and back. I
made sure to drive it a couple hundred miles before we
took off to give me a chance to change the oil and
adjust the valves. We made the trip without ANY
problems and have made several more long vacations
since without ANY concerns at all. I run 20/50 Castrol
in the summer and 10/40 in the winter. 
You should talk to George Lyle as he put one in the
same time as I did and has since put in another new
Mexican VW engine in one of his other VW's.
I have ten cars (9VWs - 7splits, 1 Bug, 1 79 Westy)and
I drive this one as a daily driver.
I don't think that there is anything I would have done
any different looking back two years ago...

Do call Ronnie at 928 680-7664 and talk it over with
him.
Any other questions, let me know

If some of this sounds like a plug for Ronnie, it is
