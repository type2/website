He's a real go getter, but 5 foot 10 and only 113 pounds.  I always tell
him, &quot;In a dog fight, it's not the size of the dog that matters, it's the
size of the fight in the dog.&quot;  However, at 16, everything is unfair and ego
deflating... including VWs.  He used to be embarrassed when I'd drop him off
at school in my bus.  At least until he saw how the other kids looked at it
and would give him gestures of &quot;hang loose&quot; and peace signs.  Now it's the
best thing since peanut butter (of course, I always thought so).  I just
need to learn more about the &quot;hit 'em low, Son&quot; and &quot;If you fake 'em to the
right, they'll....&quot; stuff.  I've fooled him into thinking that I know
exactly what's happening at those games, but I'm really clueless!  I've just
watched enough re-runs of The Brady Bunch and Leave It To Beaver to know
what to say to get him through some frustrating times.  So far, it's worked.

Northern California...  that's on my list of places to explore.  Was hoping
to go over to Eastern Oregon, but heard that the weather will be
unpredictable this time of year.  Ya' gotta love those weekend get away
adventures!!!  What kind of treasures are worth seeing in your neck of the
woods?

but if he shows an undefeated
attitude, he may catch someone's attention and get moved up to first
string.

I'm in northern california, so maybe we can hook up some day.
Certainly feel free to drop in if you are passing through Red Bluff.
