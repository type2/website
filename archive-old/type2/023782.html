Subject: Exhaust stud help sought.

Hi Volks,
		I'm looking for advice on how to tackle an exhaust
stud replacement.
 The stud in question has corroded and lost its threads, so a nut
will no longer stay on. Needless to say the exhaust is blowing.

 I have seen &quot;stud extractors&quot; for sale at the local flaps. I'm not
sure exactly what they comprise but my suspicion is that they rely
on a good thread to lock on to. Is this correct? Are there varying
designs?

 I've seen suggestions to weld a nut on the end (should I be able to
do this in-situ, with a MIG or arc welder?) but am concerned that
I'll just break off the stud, given its poor state.

 I've also wondered whether I might be able to cut a smaller thread
onto the stud, though access is tight. Anyone tried this? 

 Suggestions on how to proceed would be appreciated. I could do 
without pulling the engine/head if there's an alternative.

Cheers,
	 W.
