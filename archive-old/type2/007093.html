Hey Man, get a life!!!!!!!!what is this stuff???

Hello there, I`m deep in the restoration of a UK 1974 Devon 
conversion at the mo.  Getting the bodywork  done next week (new doors
&amp; F/W arches &amp; seat belt pans) while the interior has been stripped. 
Put a reconned Volkspares Gold engine in.  With the van stripped it
goes like a Banshee (well sort of).  Looking forward to camping the
Highlands and Islands of Scotland over the summer, once everything is
back in place.  Hail!! Hail!! The Celts (Glasgow Celtic) are here!!!!
PS Enjoying the list so far, loads of good wee techy tips.  Ally Rees,
Scotland
