Keep that mechanic!  The ones that understand (*truly* understand) and can fix FI
are few and far-between 

&gt; &quot;The &quot;best&quot; carb conversion is dual carbs; my Westy's

&gt;Thats what I have. What kind of gas milage do you get?
&gt;Im getting 16 in mixed driving, 18 on the freeway. 

Can't say for sure, but it was *roughly* 20mpg .. I'm afraid
I can't be more precise than that, the speedometer didn't 
work and the gas gauge was flakey.  I've got that stuff
fixed *now*, but I just put the new engine in yesterday...
