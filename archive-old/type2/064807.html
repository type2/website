&gt; I'm looking for ideas for the engine I'm having built for my bus. 

When I was going through this process I thought of a number of things 
(including a Subaru engine. It's been done). 

When I went for a drive in a double cab ute (pickup) with a 1776, mild 
cam and twin carbs, I decided to go the same way.

&gt; I'm not going to be driving much faster than the speed limit.

That's what they all say. 

If you get a bigger engine, you'll have to keep an eye on your speed. 
You'll be having so much fun, you might forget yourself.
  
&gt; I DO need an engine that will have enough pulling power that I
&gt; won't need to shift to first gear going up a hill pulling this trailer. 

I have found the 1776 to have heaps of torgue. I have a standard 1600 
gearbox and I rarely change down to second for normal suburban corners. I 
only use first when I pull away from a dead stop on flat ground. 

 
&gt; My thoughts are an 1835 with low compression. I want to be able to burn
&gt; regular fuel. I don't want it to overheat. I want the engine to last awhile.
&gt; I don't want to have to spend a fortune on special oil coolers. 

I DO have an oil cooler but I fitted it when I thought I was overheating 
when I wasn't. The original temp gauge was not accurate.

I have been told that 1835s run hot. Others on the list may be able to 
explain the relationship between cylinder wall thickness and the the case 
machining that is required for the bigger 1835 barrels.

I have also been told that you really need twin carbs, or a twin barrel 
single carb to help keep the engine cool.

 &gt; My questions are:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. What engine configuration would you recommend for this situation.
&gt; 
In case you haven't guessed, I am very happy with my 1776 and I think 
that it will probably suit your needs. It will probably be a bit cheaper 
as well but I'm only guessing on that one.

&gt; 2. Who should I get to build this engine.

Sorry, can't help on that one. I had mine built locally and it cost 
$A3200, of which $350 was labour. The exchange rate is about $A1 = 
$US0.70 at the moment. However, VW parts are at least twice 
the price in Australia as what you guys have to pay.

Best of luck in your decision making.
