Steel parts can be protected from rust with a hot dip coating of melted 
paraffin wax. In the U.S., you can find it as GULFWAX in the canning 
section of your grocery store. I believe the factory used this for parts 
protection (sorry, can't remember where I got this from).

When you need use them, you can use a hair dryer to melt the wax off. For 
a final cleaning use mineral spirits (never gasoline;&gt;).

I use this method myself and find it protects my parts at a low price.
