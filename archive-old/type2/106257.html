Subject: Locksmiths?

Hey guys,

	I was told that some of you here are lock smiths and that you would
be able to (for a fee) re-key my sliding and hatch door of my bus with the
same keys that I now have for my front door handles. I just ordered a NEW
set of door handles with matching keys for the front.


Thanks,
