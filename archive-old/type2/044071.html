Subject: [T2] engine and emissions testing

Hi Everyone,
   I've just spent the last hour or so in the archives and am confused from 
reading contradicting posts.  Anyone with first hand experience to my 
questions, I'd appreciate a reply.
   First of all, the situation is this.  I'm considering buying a 76 bus.  
It's just come to New York from Arizona and the U.S. southwest, and has 
almost no rust on the body or frame.  Well there is a little around the 
windshield,as usual, and on the roof, where the sun has baked off the paint. 
  The interior is trashed as a young woman and her dog lived in there.  All 
of that is no problem, I can easily deal with those things.  The kicker is 
this, the engine has been replaced with a DP 1600 that has no compression in 
  one cylinder.  Even that isn't a real problem, what I'm worried about is 
this.  Can a rebuilt, and well tuned 1600 pass the emission tests,in New 
York, that would be required for a FI 2 liter, that should be in there?
   For what it's worth, the engine conversion looks to have been well done.  
Cooling tin and engine compartment seal all around.  Wiring and lines and 
hoses are all neat and secure, ect.  I don't know what has been done to the 
transaxle, and either does the fella who's trying to sell it for his 
daughter.

All opinions and information is welcome
