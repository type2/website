Subject: Re: [T2] paint code or name 70 westy

&gt; Does any one know the paint code or the name
&gt; of the color for a 70 westy?
&gt; I am getting ready to paint mine and I cant pinpoint
&gt; the color in the paint books. 
&gt; My tag is missing.

Do you mean the sticker is missing or is the M-plate
missing?

If you have the M-plate still in your car then there
is no problem. the 1st six numbers on the 3rd line
indicate the paintcolour that was used. The code
problably starts with &quot;523...&quot;

Perhaps the code is on my homepage, but there's a
great chance it isn't. The reason is because I haven't
updated the pages for a long time (sorry). Below is
the URL, if you have any questions about it let me
know!
