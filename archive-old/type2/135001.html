Subject: Re: [T2] VW emblem anchors

From: &quot;Greg Potts&quot; &lt;Greg_at_pottsfamily_dot_ca&gt;
&gt; Lots of those logos are available....  The problem is that they all say
&gt; Ford, Toyota, or BMW.

I had the idea to repro the one that fits the front of my own bus (I don't
have an emblem for it, would have to find one), but got a number of warnings
about the VWoA thing.

It would be nice to have a cheap alternative.  Maybe sell them in pairs.  I
had the idea of scoring the design at the stress points where the emblem
attached to the bus.  If someone tried to remove it would simply break off
at the score, though I'm not sure if the fasteners would hold tight enough
to give the scored lines a chance to break.

The resin I use can be chrome plated, or I can metalize it during casting.
For that matter, it could be primed and painted, too.

Now that things are looking up for the casting business I can get the
projects already in the works going again.
