Subject: Re: [T2] long distance bus purchase

Can you both set something up as a C.O.D where once it is there you can overnight him the money order....?
That way he can send you the title overnighted the same way ...
you will have the bus....
you send him the money (money order,cashiers check....)overnight
he sends you the title overnight...
???
seems kinda the best way...

so someone local out there is driving it to you?
so what is this person getting out of it ?
is it comeing out of your pocket or the sellars?

peace and good luck

&gt;I'm planning on buying a bus, off of a contact made thru the internet.  I'm
&gt;going to have someone local drive and pick up the bus and bring it back to
&gt;me.  Does anyone have any ideas on a safe way for me to pay the seller?  I
&gt;mean, I trust the guy, but I would just feel funny sending the guy a money
&gt;order for that kind of money, you know.......  It is a private seller,
&gt;so....... Any ideas?
&gt;Thanks in advance!!
