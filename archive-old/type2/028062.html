List,
Question:
I have a single 2-bbl Weber on my bus.  I am using one of those little cubical FLAPS $40.00 electric fuel pumps to feed it.  I think this thing is pushing about 14 psi, but i'm not sure - i know the original FI pump ran at about 28.  Should i use a pressure regulator?  Also, will not using a regulator damage the carb or will too much fuel pressure manifest itslef in some other way?
TIA,
-clark gordon
