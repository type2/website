BTDT... Problem with picking up the relay trigger from the coil is that
as soon as you turn the key the batteries are tied together.  If both
batteries have a charge, this works fine.  However, if the aux battery
is absolutely flat, you won't be able to start your bus.  The flat
battery sucks the charge out of your starting battery.  

A better solution is to splice into the alternator idiot light wire at
the voltage regulator.  That way, the relay will not fire until the
alternator is actually pushing electrons.
