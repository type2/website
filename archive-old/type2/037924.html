Subject: Oil leak fixed

Woohoo!  Boy am I psyched... not so much as a single drop of oil coming
from the '79 Westy anymore.  For the sake of posterity, the three culprits
and my fixes:

1) oil pressure gauge sender (on a standoff pipe) leak:
   I simply put some teflon tape on (despite the advice to the
   contrary in the instruction sheet - don't worry it'll still make
   electrical contact with the case) and tightened it up.
2) sump plate leaking: 
   flipped over the o-ring (it actually has a groove which matches the
   plate) and reattached the plate.
3) (camshaft?) plug between oil pump and oil filler:
   slapped some JB weld over the plug and let it dry overnight.
   this was a minor leak.


Voila!  Many thanks to the listees who offered advice.  Hope this helps
someone else out in the future...
