Subject: Re: Anti-Spam Blacklists


Quick Friday update for them few as are interested:

--Mr. Raistrick has turned off one of the blackhole lists, which blocked
open relays. Consequently we are happy to be getting mail again from Kyle
and fellow Qwest subscribers.

--Said Qwest subscribers may note that once again this week your ISP is the
second most egregious source of spam in the entire world, perhaps because
Qwest persists in running open relays that we no longer block, to wit:
http://www.spamhaus_dot_org/top10.lasso

--It is not right to block legitimate mail from subscribers, so we stopped.
It is also not right to pay Qwest to piss in the river. Take it under
advisement, please.

Okay enough already,

--Hoop
