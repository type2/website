Subject: [T2] fuel tank vent lines

     Does anybody know off the top of their head, the size of the fuel tank
vent lines on a 82 Vanagon?  When I fill up, the vent lines on the passenger
side are wet &amp; I can smell gas.  I would like to replace all of them while I
am doing it.  I have not figured out yet if I can do this with the fuel tank
in place.  Any suggestions or tips?

     On another note, I sold the 76 Westy yesterday.  It was kind of sad to
see her go.  I am now down to just the 82 westy.
