Subject: Re: [T2] loss of power and really bad sound

Cracked dizzy cap or rotor, points block broke, dizzy clamp not tight and 
timing slipped, fuel pump failing, clogged fuel filter, loose wire on coil, 
piece of junk clogged a jet in the carb. Those are just some of the 
possibles off the top of my head.
