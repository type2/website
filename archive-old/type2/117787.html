The metal that holds the pin may be fine, but the &quot;curls&quot; on both that 
part and you accelerator pedal are deformed from 30+ years of useage.

You *can* bend them back.  Take the pin out and the pedal off and look
both of them over carefully.  Does the pin flop around int the curls of 
both pieces?.._dot_use pliers and *carefully* reshape and bend them so that 
they are straight and tight like they used to be.

Re-install and then move/bend the whole pedal to one side or 
another(gently!) so that the rod goes thru the hole in the floor smoothly 
without touching the sides.

Be creative.._dot_can you make a better one than the vw engineers did?
In my experience, this is one of those things that we can do a little 
better on in our bus than the original...

Cheers,dave

&gt; In my futile attempt to get an accelerator pedal that won't stick, I think
&gt; I've found a new wrench in the works. My acc. pedal hinge (
&gt; http://www.busdepot_dot_com/busdepot/details.jsp?partnumber=211721613 ) seems to
&gt; be lifting off of the floor a bit. Not down where its welded, but where the
&gt; curl is that holds the pin. This results in my pedal being turned too far to
&gt; the right, thus throwing off all the linkage under the bus. Sounds good, eh
&gt; :)
