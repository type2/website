Subject: Re: [T2] 1600 DP engine (new) with bad #2 cylinder

perhaps the tube is still in the cylinder, shorting out the plug?


Jen



&gt;.  I had first discovered the problem when
&gt; I pulled the #2 spark plug and saw the the electrode was bent so that
&gt; there was hardly any gap.  I looked down into the carburetor and saw
&gt; that the aforementioned tube was missing, so I deduced that is what
&gt; caused the spark plug electrode to get bent.
