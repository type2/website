Quoting Jason Meyer &lt;thesykboy_at_gmail_dot_com&gt;:
&gt; I have looked on eBay, and there are certainly enough copy-cats that claim
&gt; to do as well of a job, but I just wanted to know if any of you have done
&gt; things to better insulate and quite the inside of your buses.

I have installed a bit of Dynamat Extreme in our 78 transporter.  It's
not the cheapest, but it is one of the lightest, while not loosing any
of the performance.  Keep the weight in mind if you plan on doing a
large portion of your bus with material similar to this.  If you are
only doing the loudest areas, the front wheel wells bring a large
portion of the noise into the cab.  I found the best results from
doing just the two front doors and the front wheel wells, although I
have also done the sliding door and the panel opposite it.  Also, the
insulating factor of this material is about as good as the bare metal,
so don't expect anything like that from it. I have also done the
complete top (minus the access hatch) of the engine bay.
