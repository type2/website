&gt; I have a 78 westy, I was wanting to get the stock heater working. Is the

The BA-6 is not &quot;in the way&quot; and the stock heat can work well with it
installed.  If you remove the BA-6 you will need to install a connector
pipe to replace it in transporting hot air to the front.

&gt; Can the stock heater work with the BA6, or is it inline and blocking the
&gt; stock?

The BA-6 is inline, but it contains no parts that would impede airflow
from the heater boxes.  If you are not getting heat at the front, this is
not your problem.

Do you have installed, connected, and sealed to each other:
the fan over the engine;
the tubes connecting the fan to the heater boxes;
the heater boxes;
the metal tubes from the heater boxes up to the flap valves;
the flexible tubes connecting the flaps to the body?

Are the connections tight on the rear air collector manifold?

Is that rear air collector manifold rusted out?

Is it connected to the BA-6?

Is the front of the BA-6 connected to the heater distribution tube at the
front of the bus?

If all thse connections are present and tight you will have good heat.
The problem with bus heat is that there are many connections and all leak
a bit.  After 5-6 leaks, there is no heat left.

                             OOK!
