Forgot to mention one thing that I feel is important. As I've been stripping
the paint off my Westy (originally Marigold, with two repaints of white) I
have been amazed at the number of small rust spots I've found lurking under
what looked like sound paint. I attribute this to poor preparation during
one of the repaints, and that is what I am trying to avoid this time.
