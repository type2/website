&gt; Did you know that you can drive with a broken clutch cable?  Not forever,
&gt; and not at all conveniently, but if your clutch cable breaks, you don't
&gt; *need* to call a tow truck.

I agree, I once drove my car from work to my home, a distance of about 40 miles after the clutch cable snapped as soon as I got out of the base gates. Luckily it was 3.00 am. However when I was a delivery driver I barely used the clutch as the gearbox was brilliant and was so easy to drive without using it. Like you say the problems come when starting and stopping as to stop you MUST stall it and to start you need to operate the start motor whilst in 1st gear, neither of which does much for the engine and gearbox but it will get you out of trouble and is a good reminder to put the spare in the back!! I would advise fiolk who have never tried it before, to find a nice open space, like a runway (unused) and get the feel of it.
I would rather drive without the clutch (except starting and stopping) as you get a feel for the engine and gearbox speeds and of course it saves wear on the clutch and the cable.
The best indication I that the engine and gearbox are at the same speed it when by applying a slight amount of pressure to the gear stick, as you let off the trottle gently you will feel the gearbox relieve the pressure and allow you to change gear, going up that is. When changing down, the gearstick will easily move into neutral when the pressure is taken off the throttle and when in neutral, by gently increasing the rpm you will feel the gear drop in, careful use of the brakes is helpful as well. This is not for folk that cannot easily balance a feather on their nose as it requires gentle throttle and brake movements and a feeeeeeel for the state of the gearbox and engine speeds.
