Subject: EFI sputtering

Problem with 77 Westy with EFI...
After driving down the highway for about the 20 minutes my engine starts 
sputtering eventually cuts out. If I wait 10 minutes or so it will run fine, 
but in maybe another 10 minutes it sputters and eventually dies an ugly 
death. It starts subtly with a few misses and gets more and more harsh. Kind 
of like running out of gas.

The amount of time the engine runs is directly proportional to the amount of 
ride time I get until the sputtering starts. Any ideas?

Thanks! Marvin
77 Westy

PS My tire guys happily swapped out the light truck tyres he installed for 
some C rated cooper tires, he has not installed them yet, but I appreciate 
all of the advice.
