&gt; Now, how can a piece of piston ring find its way to the crankcase without
&gt; lots of bad noises happening?  It's probably possible, but short of a
&gt; major chunk of piston breaking off (which would be really impressive in
&gt; the oil screen) I can't see how it could happen.

If you flip around a piston so you can look at it from the crank side,
you'll note there's an aluminum &quot;bottom&quot; to the ring grooves. This &quot;bottom&quot;
(ring land is the correct term) is only attached to the piston body in three
places; there's a goodly gap between the ring land and the piston wall
almost all the way around.

One of the hunks of metal she showed us all was a piece of aluminum that
looks very much like a piece of a ring land. This is what I'm thinking:

a. A ring land and the ring that it supports broke somehow. It doesn't
matter how. It's nine years old. Who can tell?

b. The ring land fell into the case, followed by a couple of ring chunks.
They made their way to the oil screen, where they were found, photographed,
posted on the Internet and commented on for a few days.

I'm starting to wonder: if this is a bottom compression ring, and the oil
scraper's still in good shape on that cylinder, would the compression in
that cylinder be really noticeably lower?
