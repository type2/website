&gt; Well, after 4 months of constant use, Jasper broke down on me and left 
&gt; me stranded. I was coming down Steiner in downtown SF (that famous road 
&gt; with the pastel houses on it, with the city in the background) and when 
&gt; I came to the bottom of the hill, I had downshifted into first and 
&gt; realized it was not coming out of first. Try as I might, she was not 
&gt; going to let me shift into any other gear. I coasted up the road in 
&gt; first long enough to pull her out of the way of traffic, and turned it 
&gt; off. I could get it out of first finally, so I started it back up 
&gt; thinking it was a fluke when I realized I could not engage any gears 
&gt; when it was running, and my clutch pedal sunk to the floor rather 
&gt; easily. uh oh.

so, it wouldn't go INTO gear, or, once IN gear, it wouldn't go anywhere?

If it wouldn't go into gear, I'd say it sounds like your clutch cable, 
which is not too
difficult to replace ( i carry a spare).  To check this, just get under 
your bus and look
towards to top of the tranny from LEFT (LIL) side.  You should see a 
little lever arm
with a cable attached to it.

If there's no cable, or, if the cable is slack, you've found your 
problem.

The key to adjusting this cable once you get it back in, btw, is to hold 
the cable with a
pair of vice-grips while you turn the wing-nut that adjusts the clutch.  
If you fail
to hold the cable while you're doing this, it will turn WITH the nut and 
eventually start
to fray, then snap.

good luck,
