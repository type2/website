Hey there Tony,

I don't write the ads, I just report them 8-)

Yep, I think you've got it right, 4 forward/one reverse. Could be a
typo or it might be that the seller just doesn't have a clue. At
least they *think* its a manual, probably think it must be like the
honda/toyota/nissan that they drive with a 5 spd. Might be a good
opportunity for a buyer to swoop in and grab a good deal, as the
seller might not know exactly what they've got.

I love seeing some of the ads, like for a 77 &quot;Vanagon&quot;. I used to be
confused about the VW bus ads w/ &quot;open depot&quot; in the description, but
I've recently learned that open depot=sunroof, so it's a good thing.
The best ones are the ones that say &quot;Former owner Jerry Garcia&quot;. If
Jerry owned half the buses that the advertisers say he owned, he must
have had hundreds of busses in his fleet. Ahh.. Some peoples kids...

Later...
