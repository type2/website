&gt;We have a bus with a confirmed dead cold start valve. It helps our &gt;van to floor the gas pedal when trying to start it cold.

The cold start is a fifth injector that fires ONLY during starting to richen the mixture in the manifold prior to the injectors.

&gt;My theory (unconfirmed) is that it moves the flapper in the flapper &gt;box causing the computer to send more gas to the injectors.

Not sure what you're saying. The connector is two prong on my '79 california: 1. signal from the brain(?) and  2. the ground at the c.s. injector. Mine is still well sheathed so I can't see if there's two wires connected to one pin. Is this what you're asking?
