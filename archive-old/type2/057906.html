Subject: Warm / cool air vacuum connection

After helping a friend replace the heads on my '76 2L bus with dual
carbs I'm slowly beginning to realise a few things are not operating
correctly.

The main problem that I just cannot work out is as follows : there is a
vacuum controlled plate just inside the air filter which I believe is
meant to close when the engine is cool (taking &quot;warm&quot; air that has
flowed over the RHS head) and open when the engine is warmed up (taking
&quot;cool&quot; air from the hose that terminates above the battery on the RHS).
A PO had sealed the vacuum connection, but after cleaning this off and
applying some manual suction it seemed the plate was still operating
.... but where does this vacuum line connect to?  Looks like I need a
source of vacuum when the engine is cool that is reduced during warmup,
but neither Muir or Haynes is any help as to whether to reconnect this
line.

BTW, the head / compression problems I was experiencing recently (thanks
to those who email suggestions) were solved by a valve grind,
replacement of valve guides and rethreading of two plug threads damaged
by crossthreading.

Thanks

Mike
