Michael,
This was an excellant peice of information and will help me.  Thanks

Look where the intake manifolds meet the heads. Is the big thick gasket 
between them. Look at your known 2.0L see them. If they are not 
there on the 
engine in question then most likely it is a 1700, also on the 
1700 the heads 
have smog ports 2 per head, one on each side of the intake ports. The 
easiest way to tell is to pull a head off and get the piston 
size. But there 
again you might find something that is last built specific, maybe someone 
bore the heads and put in 102mm or 104mm pistons in.
