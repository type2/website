    &gt; Oh, btw, my sunroof is leaking as well. Where's the best place to get a seal
    &gt; for that? And how tough is it to install?

clogged drain tubes are an ever-present problem.

I deal with it using a high pressure water gun at the car wash;
down/out for the front ones, up/in for the rear (the latter is
sub-optimal as the gutter-lay of the piping does leak when reverse
flushed)
