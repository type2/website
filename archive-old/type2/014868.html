&lt;&lt; Anyone ever have any experience with oil slinging past the oil slinger 
washer, hitting the pulley and making a nice mess of the motor?  This is a 
sudden development on a normally reliable 1600 DP with about 11,000 on it.  
Any ideas how to fix? &gt;&gt;

This seems like it would be pretty rare....the threads on the crank pulley 
actually *screw in* so as to keep any oil that might seep past the slinger 
...it keeps it going back into the motor.  Sounds like maybe the hole is out 
of round. IMHO
