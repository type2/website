Subject: Re: [T2] battery/city power?

You probably have a blown fuse in the back of the transformer. Under the rear
seat, drivers side, under the wood box.

Yes, unscrew the cap and fill the tank.
No, the hose to the city water connection will NOT fill the tank. It goes
directly to the faucet. After you connect a hose and turn the water on, turn
the chrome lever to the right of the faucet. Do not turn the pump on with the
round switch.

&gt;I took Elvis out for 'our' shakedown camping cruise this past weekend and had
a little problem with the city power (I think). The fridge would work when on
battery power but would not on city power. However, the receptacle below the
rear seat did work fine as I ran a portable electric heater all night long.
Kind of a bummer to not be able to use the fridge though. I put a new
auxilliary battery in before I left and I was wondering if maybe I did
something wrong? Another thing, how do I fill the water tank? Is it through
that pvc thing next to the sink or do I hook a hose up to the outside?
Thanks,
Richard
