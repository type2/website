&gt; Hello!
&gt;
&gt;   I just wanted to let you all know about the new Volks Folks Air-Cooled forums. You can visit them by going to:
&gt;
&gt;   http://volksfolks.forumwise_dot_com/
&gt;
&gt;   These forums were created on May 16, 2006. As of yet they don't have
&gt;   any members or posts. I'm hoping to change that by getting the word
&gt;   out.

Not to rain on a parade, but what is the point of starting yet another VW
forum?  Between Usenet groups, mailing lists, and web forums it seems
like things are pretty well covered already.  Is there something unique
about this new forum?
