Subject: fuel line blues

Trying to fix a leak under my daily driver early '68
bus. Argggh.
Stinking of gas and suffering frozen hands, i decided
to back off and ponder this. (And buy a couple fire
extinguishers.)

considering mess and frustration, I might as well
replace the line all the way back to the tank.

How tough is this?

On my particular '68 bus, the line goes from the tank
on the pass. side, over the shifter rod, etc and comes
down on the driver side above the CVs where it
connects to the metal tube that then goes through the
fire wall to the pump. (the leak is at the connection
between the tube and the hose.)

Can I replace the flexible line from underneath
without removing sheet metal, etc.?

I don't have to pull the engine for this? (For the
love of god, say NO!)

(BTW, i checked the TYPE II archives, lib. and Bentley
w/o much edification on this particular point.)


Any help appreciated. Answer on my personal email, if
this is old hat to the folks on the list.
