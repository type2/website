Subject: Horn Button won't come off?

Living in the heat of the southwest, the steering wheel on my 75 bus is
falling apart. Cracks and chips everywhere! I was going to remove and
restore it using epoxy, but I can't seem to get the horn button off.
Seems to want so much pressure to remove that it may break. Any Ideas?
I'm Beginning to think about trying to locate another steering wheel and
horn button before I continue. Any thoughts on the cost?
