Subject: RE: [T2] Ign. Switch replaced, now starter failing]

Billy-
There are two large copper contacts inside the solenoid cap.
They complete the power circuit to the starter, and are often arc-corroded.
This repair will require a soldering iron to R+R the solenoid cap.
While the starter is out, you can disassemble it for cleaning the
commutator with sandpaper, and a little lube at the bearings.
You can't electrically test the starter unless you have a spare
trans bellhousing to support the nose bushing, or you have the
self-supporting automatic-style starter.
Altogether, a very educational experience, you will &quot;think starter&quot;,
And you gain a fresh starter service life, for just a little time.
Dave

From: Bill Price &lt;bprice_at_mcdanielfire_dot_com&gt;

Just replaced the ignition switch, battery about a year old, new
transmission ground a few years back, showed 12.5vdc at the ignition switch
terminal 30 when I was installing the switch.  Solenoid seems to be doing
it's thing, as I can hear it.

Since I can hear the solenoid, that means everything up to that point on the
circuit is functioning right?

So is it mildly probable that it is the starter motor?
