--part1_151.ba07d2a.29dc4fdb_boundary

We are rebuilding a 2.0l for our 72 bus, we plan on travelling alot and 
possibly towing a trailer, but the question is shoulw we use solid lifters or 
upgrade to hydraulic, and would an upgrade in the cam be good, if so what. We 
are also using dual dellorto36mm. thanks
