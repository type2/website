&gt; Head Lights - High Beams only? At least that is what I must pull the switch
&gt; to in order for them to come on.

Make sure that the wiring to the headlight relay is correct. You'll find
a wiring diagram on Thom's vintagebus site
&lt;http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/wiring/&gt; Also, the wiring diagram does not
show the ground wire that *may* be necessary.  If the relay is not
internally grounded it will be necessary to run a ground wire.  Don't
remember the terminal number, (31 maybe?) but check it out.

&gt; 
&gt; Reverse Lights - Not working at all. Replaced bulbs. The 70 owners manual
&gt; say's there is a fuse in the engine compartment mounted above the coil. My
&gt; question is should it be in that location in a 71? If not where should I
&gt; look for it?

In the engine compartment on the left side. Usually laying loose. Wire
runs between the 12v side of the coil to the reverse switch on the trans
to the lamps.

&gt; 
&gt; Back Left side - Works as running light but not for turn signal.
&gt; 
&gt; Back Right Side - Worked for a while as a running light but very dim. Now
&gt; does not work as a running light but does work as a turn signal.
&gt; 
&gt; Back Right - same as above.

Check your grounds!
&gt; 
&gt; I have no emergency flashers either.

Fix the grounds!

&gt; 
&gt; If anyone has any input on what I could do to trouble shoot these issues
&gt; further I would be so thankful. Also if anyone could tell me the correct
&gt; types of fuses to use and which go where in the 12 port fuse box. Ie. port 1
&gt; 8 port 2 8 port 3 -16 ect.. How hard would it be to re wire the buse to
&gt; factory spec? Does anyone know of a vendor that sells a rewiring kit for the
&gt; type 2 bus?

1-8 - 8 amp (white) fuses
9 - 16 amp (red) fuse
10 - 8 amp (white) fuse
11 - 16 amp (red) fuse
12 - 8 amp (white) fuse
