&gt; Nope.  It does try to start a little better, but will

have you checked to see if the AFM is triping the double relay, sounds
like the fuel pump is running on the start circuit but as soon as it
starts it switches to the AFM to keep the fuel pump running.  a bad trace
or the plug is loose etc. could cause just this problem
