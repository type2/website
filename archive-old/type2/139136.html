&gt; I was just wondering. If the Loktite only cures anerobically, what happens to
&gt; the material that mushes out of the gap into the inside of the case? Seems
&gt; like it would be hard to get at with all the engine guts in the way. Does it
&gt; dissolve in oil or potentially slough off and plug vital oil passages,
&gt; especially the smaller ones leading to bearings and such? Would like to know
&gt; because if it works OK, I might like to give it a whirl on my upcoming engine
&gt; build.

It will mix with the oil which is why you apply only as much as you require
to seal the case. AFAIK it's ok that this happens partly because you dump
the oil quickly after you break in the motor.

I've always had helpful replies from Loctite's tech support line. Give them
a call, tell them you are using 574 to seal an automotive crankcase and they
can advise you from their database.
