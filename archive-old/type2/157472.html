Subject: Nokian Tires

Okay guys... I have looked at Nokian Tire web pages
for hours. I have gone to my friendly local Discount
Tire Store where Kevin spent a good twenty minutes on
the phone to their Nokian Tire supplier and the best
he could come up with was &quot;reinforced sidewall&quot;
passenger car tires.

TireFactory is an authorized Nokian Tire dealer. They
show no load range &quot;C&quot; or &quot;D&quot; Haakapaliitas on any web
pages and when I went to my friendly local TireFactory
the manager spent about twenty minutes pouring over
web pages and catalog pages and announced to me that
the best he could get me was the &quot;reinforced sidewall&quot;
tires.

What's the deal with the Nokians? You guys say they
exist; the dealers say they don't! Maybe they no
longer import the 14&quot; van tires but once did? Could
that be?

I was quoted $130 per tire for the reinforced sidewall
ones and one would assume the LR-D (or C, if exists)
would be substantially higher than that. Whichever I
might be able to find would be a mis-match to the
fronts, so that means I have to buy 4 of 'em.

I know they're good... -BaH
