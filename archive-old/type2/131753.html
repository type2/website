&gt;Not butyl, it can't take the heat. Better to leave them off altogether and
&gt;put the right thing on later. I do not recommend any kind of GOOP on an
&gt;engine anywhere. It just makes a mess that you will curse later.


Funny you should mention that. I was just out in the shop testing a piece of 
it with a torch. It softens fairly well with a lot of heat. This a Mastic 
that is used to seal between sections of a Manhole or Storm Sewer 
Structures. Thick, hard but plyable rolls out like a Tootsie Roll. But I am 
going to look for something else. I do have some sheet cork. But I think I 
can track done some sheet rubber. Oh well.

Thanks,

Michael Knight
