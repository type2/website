&gt; I found a rebuilt box for my '68 bus ($250), but so far have wasted 2
&gt; afternoons with 2 different pullers trying to remove the pitman arm. 
&gt; The nut was not very tight -- came right off.  I had started applying
&gt; Liquid Wrench 2 weeks ago thinking this would help loosen things up,
but
&gt; no dice!
&gt; 
&gt; I remember a post (can't remember whose) recommending a chevy
puller. Is
&gt; this worth the purchase for a probable one-time use, or should I break
&gt; down and take the job to my local VW mechanic?  Or is there another
&gt; approach I should attempt?

I used the Chevy puller, but first I had to make a &quot;U&quot; shaped adapter
out of 3/16 thick steel plate to go between the puller and the pitman
arm.  This allowed the puller to get a good hold on the back side of
the pitman arm.  Even with this the job was dicey.  I used my complete
vocabulary of blue words to no avail.  I had tightened the thing down
to the flex point (right before the d*mmit point) and the thing didn't
budge.  I was getting out the acetylene torch to give the thing a good
quick heating-up when the thing let go with a bang!

The Chevy puller was a good purchase, cost me about $12, and is also
good for pulling VW ball joints (much nicer than a pickle fork!).

Without a good puller, there's no way that you'll get the pitman arm
off that I can see.  Keep at it and it will eventually come off.

BTW, if you decide to use heat, you must heat the arm up really
_fast_, as the arm and the shaft are both steel.  You can't count on
different expansion rates of different metals helping you out.  Forget
that propane torch for this job.  You need to use a good acetylene
torch with a big tip (like a cutting tip).  Put the puller on the arm,
put as much pressure as you dare on the puller, and then heat an outer
quadrant of the arm's hub as quickly as you can (short of melting it)
with the torch.  Be careful of the pent-up energy in the puller! 

If your luck holds, you will get the pitman arm off before the heat
gets up the shaft and melts the seal.
