Subject: RE: [T2] engine issues..

I have a 1976 with a similar setup and problems you described.  My 2L
had the fuel injection, however, replaced with a single Weber
progressive.   I had the same backfire problems and sluggishness you
described.

What I found was that my carburetor needed to be reworked and my intake
was sucking some air around the seals.  The cause of the backfires was
mainly a combination of too much fuel, improperly adjusted valves, rich
exhaust, and ignition of the exhaust when added air was introduced via
exhaust leaks in my cracked heat exchangers.

I would suggest...
...check for exhaust leaks.
...check for intake leaks.
...check timing.
...check valves.

Hope this helps and good luck.
