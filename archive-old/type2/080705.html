Subject: Re:  Moving the piston in disk brake

Don't bother with the bleeder bolt - I wedge the caliper piston back by
prying between the rotor disk and the piston.  I cut a piece of 2x4 into a
wedge shape (chop saw) so I can wedge it between the opposite piston/rotor
space, to prevent a possibility of warping the rotor disk.  Then wedge the
piston in with a &quot;pickle fork&quot; or tie rod separator or a small pry bar
levered against the rotor with a piece of leather or such to prevent
scratching the disk.  I think I've done it with another piecer of 2x4
thinned at the end to get in there and wedge back the piston.  You need
about a foot or more of leverage.  Make sure you didn't just top up the
fluid resorvoir, or it will go above the vent hole and soak the surrounding
body.
&gt;&gt;I can't get the &quot;I
&gt; don't know what it is called&quot; to compress.  Does anyone have any
&gt; suggestions as to what I can do to get this job done Thanks for your
&gt; time.
&gt;
