I am wondering if putting another fan (or fans) inside my bus' engine
compartment would be of any great befefit? (72 camper, 1700 pancake, single
weber) Like maybe a radiator fan mounted to the engine lid or some small
fans blowing on the engine. How about some fans mounted in a way that would
&quot;suck&quot; air from my air vents? Just curious if this is a wise or worthy
modification. I read a bus ad recently that stated &quot;has an extra fan
mounted, so it can't overheat&quot;  or something like that. Thanks for any
input.
