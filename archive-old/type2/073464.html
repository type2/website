&gt;The 1973 Bus did not come with a 2.0 FI engine. The 1973 came with a 1700

In the US, all 1973 model year busses came with 1679cc (&quot;1.7L&quot;) engines.
They were all normally aspirated - in fact the only Type 2's that were ever
*not* normally aspirated were those with TDI engines (I don't think there
have been any in the US).  Fuel injection or carburation has nothing to do
with being normally aspirated.  Normally aspirated refers to the lack of
forced induction, such as a turbocharger or supercharger.

&gt;If you are in California, the '73 has the distinct advantage of not
&gt;requiring a smog check. Which is one of the main reasons I own one.

I own one because it was a good deal when I purchased it.  People have all
kinds of opinions on this issue - mine is that any year bus is a good year
- I can't think of any year that I really wouldn't want.  I am very happy
with my '73 FWIW.
