Richard, Stevo &amp; The List:

I don't really know if it was an OG double slider Westy camper I saw
once out at the Aadlen Brother's bone-yard in Sun Valley, CA - but I saw
one there once!

It was built on a '68-'69 body style (round reflectors), had windowed
sliders, and no apparent damage to the body.  I don't remember much else
as I was trying to keep myself standing upright amidst the copious
amounts of drewl and tears leaking from several orifici and/or stumbling
over my lower mandible...  I was really too stunned to 'member much
else, other than it was white, I don't 'member if it was a poptop (I
think it was) or a weekender, I didn't have a camera, and I didn't know
then how to read the &quot;paint plate&quot; data for the M-codes.  Only MUCH
later on did I discover that it is possible to buy vehicles from Aadlen
Brother's - I had always been of the opinion that once cars had gone in,
that was all she wrote...

One day I shall have either a post-'72 full-tilt Deluxe double slider, a
post-'72 double slider Kombi kitted out as a Westy, or a post-'72 double
cab pick-up (and I KNOW where one is)...

I have to stop now - the keyboard is getting too slippery from tears
just recalling all this :-(
