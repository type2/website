Subject: Re: sliding door -- got it open

It is open!  My door ('71) had a solid control rod
at the top of the rear latch and a cable at the bottom.
I had misunderstood the way the latch worked (I was
never going to pound on it -- that was the &quot;restorer&quot;
that did that), and I was trying in vain to operate the 
rear latch by pushing on the control rod.  
v
The solution was to *pull* out on the cable at the 
bottom of the rear latch to disengage it.  Thank you
for helping
