&gt; Since there has been so much talk of improving headlights, I wanted to
&gt; advise those who have a '68-85 bus or vanagon (round headlights) that there
&gt; is a cheap and easy upgrade that involves little cost and no modification.
&gt; I once again have the H4 headlight kits for $34.95/pair.

Ron:
I agree that these are a great way to improve nighttime vision. I had a
set of these (Brazillian Hella, I think) clear back in the 80's and they
were great. Two caveats however:
1. They don't have the alignment bumps on them that sealed beams have,
thus necessitating manual alignment.
2. They do, over time, get tarnished inside in the silvering. I used
mine for 7 or 8 years and could definitely see some degradation inside.
This is why they are not DOT legal and what DOT is protecting us from by
making us use sealed beams. Sealed beams are mediocre, but at least they
won't get worse! I'm sure they could be taken apart and resilvered, like
the lights on your 1934 Duesenburg J, but it might be cheaper to buy
another set for spares in a few years.
I may buy another set myself!
