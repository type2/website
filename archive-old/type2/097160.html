Subject: 78 westy ignition switch

Hello Again,
        I'm needing to install the mechanical side of my ignition switch. The
electrical side is fine and in place. I was wondering if their was anything I
should know before I perform this task. Any helpful tips would be appreciated.
One last thing, The old switch was missing from the bus when I got it from the
PO so I'm not sure exactly how it came out.

Thanks

Greg
