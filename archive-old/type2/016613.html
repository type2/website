    You have to remember that in most European countries registration
fees have to do with the size of the engine... this is why the upright
engine was available so much longer in Europe.  Vanagons were available
with a 1600 flat motor.  For the most part the US was the only country
that really demanded more HP in what was essentially a utility
vehicle...

    Lately I've realized that when I'm in one of my V-dubs I tend to
drive slower, safer, and much more relaxed.  My wife actually dislikes
going anywhere with me when I use her 3.1L V6 Oldsmobile, I tend to
drive MUCH faster and more aggressive...

    IMHO our Busses tend to be just about right for Power, if a bit
under Horsepowered... Even my '73 Westy automatic will do 70-75 mph, but
it takes around 16-18 seconds 0-60...

    Remember... it is all the folks in a hurry that are driving
unsafely... &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;
