I have for sale one Sears Pak-A-Potti with a 3 gallon holding tank and a 1.1
gallon fresh water tank. Unit is green (avocado) and white. It is also a one
piece unit. History of unit....PO purchased and used it for his Westy. It
looks and works good (the water pumps and the flapper works). It came with
the deal when I purchased FreeBird. I am the second family owner of this
Westy, so the &quot;potty&quot; was only used by PO. My family has never used it as we
have another.

Price is $15 or B.O. from listmembers ONLY, plus shipping. Item is not
heavy. I am in MT, USA. If I hear a &quot;really good story&quot; as to why they need
this for their Westy (not the obvious reason), then it's free plus shipping.
:-)

If no takers then it goes with my moving sale....
