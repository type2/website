Subject: Front seal assistance needed QUICKLY please.

I'm in the process of installing the front seal on my 2000. I'm used to
seating any seal to the bottom of its recess, but after installing this
seal I can see that it is not all the way to the bottom of the recess.
It is flush with the outer edge of the recess. This is the edge that
Bently refers to on page 49 figure 15-6. Is this farr enough or should I
drive it to the bottom of the recess? Quick answer would be appreciated
becouse I put a light coat of gasket sealant on the outside of the seal,
The part that touches the recess metal not the flywheel. I dont want it
to set if I need to drive it in further.
Thanks so much!
Tom
