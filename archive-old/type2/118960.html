snip,snip

&gt;Also, I am ashamed to say that I made it only about 10 miles on a recycle
&gt;run with rebuilt 041 heads and Dellorto DRLA 36's on an 1835cc.  I limped
&gt;home and now a few days later, looked under my valve covers.  There appears
&gt;to be something holding #2 exhaust valve open approx. 4 mm.  either that or
&gt;it is seized in its guide, or something else horrific has happened.  Might
&gt;have sucked in a piece of debris or (gasp!) a loose nut or something?!?
(yes
&gt;I have air filters on there) Would anyone admit to having this happen
&gt;before?

In a 30 minute old brand new rebuilt engine, I had my intake valves seize.
You are lucky that you did not have more damage. One of my intake pushrods
got stuck under its rocker and the pushrod broke a huge, unrepairable, piece
out of the head in the pushrod tube o-ring sealing area. DO NOT RUN that
engine another second. You must remove the heads, and inspect the valve
train and pistons, etc.. and perform the necessary re-repairs. In my case,
my brand valves seized in their brand new perfectly reamed guides because of
bad fuel. Somebody put something in my gasoline tank while I was waiting for
parts and machine shop labor. I now have a locking gas cap. I don't want to
say in a public forum what I found in the fuel, but , Will Anderson, you can
email me off list and I will tell you. You should inspect your fuel and
inspect your fuel tank. An easy way to take a peak into the tank is from the
fuel level sender hole.
