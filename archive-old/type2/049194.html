Subject: [T2] split Handbrake as pseudo diff-lock for off-road use!!!

Dear All,
I came across the WWW page of a German Guy form Cologne who has taken 
his T2 all over Marokko etc.
The pictures are absolulty incredible so check em out on:
The text is mainly in German but it is not easy to get around..

He has also installed two extra handbrake leavers in his van to 
breakdown a whell tha is free spinning when stuck in the mud or sand.
Sounds like a very good idea and the setup is great as it does not 
interfere with normal handbreake function.
Has anyone got experience with this? or any thoughts?
The deails are on:
