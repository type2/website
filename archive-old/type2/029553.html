&gt; Hi Paul
&gt; 
&gt; You have 2 options here. Firstly go out and buy a cig lighter socket. You
&gt; will then need to mount it on the dash. Ideally you will get a socket that
&gt; comes with a bracket to mount to the underside of the dash, but in my case I
&gt; cut a hole in the dash. If you do this make sure there is room - I was left
&gt; with a very tight fit up against the glove box liner.
&gt; 
&gt; The alternative is to get a small 2 pin socket with matching plug - they do
&gt; some tiny ones at RV shops. The one I've got is surface mounted just next to
&gt; the master cylinder.

This is the way to go!  The cigar lighter socket makes a _really_ bad
power outlet, since the electrical contact depends upon the friction of
the plug in the socket.  this is great for the lighter, since it only
stays connected for a few seconds at a time and you really don't care
about a bad connection (the idea is to heat the thing up anyway!)

there are a zillion different 2-conductor plug and socket combinations,
but the neatest and cheapest I've found is a 2-pin Molex plug available at
Radio Shack.  Their catalog number for this part ends in 222, but I can't
remember the rest.

These come as a male-female set and cost a couple of bucks per set.  They
come with pins that you crimp and solder to the conductors and then push
through the backside of the connector until they lock.  Very easy!

The conventional way to use these is to use the male plastic socket with
the female pins on the power source.  You use the female plastic part with
the male pins on the thing that uses power.  The positive lead goes to the
&quot;pointed&quot; end of the connectors, and the negative to the square end.

The Molex parts are molded with &quot;ears&quot; that snap into a small rectangular
hole for bulkhead mounting.  You just snip them off for use as an in-line
connector.

The Molex plugs are good for 10 amps continuous and 20 or so in surge.
This is good enough for anything except heaters and cigar lighters!
