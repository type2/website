&lt;&lt; Go ahead and run a tap through carefully.  Lube it often and go in small
steps in and out.  Remember the idea is to clean out the existing threads,
not to cut new metal.

Put on the new backing plates and torque the bolts to the correct spec.
If the threads hold the specified torque, they should be fine.  Otherwise,
you will have to take corrective measures.

Without running out into the sub-freezing driveway to check...Couldn't the
correct size nut be tack welded to the backing plate and a slightly longer
bolt be used to insure 'togetherness' of the parts...?
