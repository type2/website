Subject: gas cap theft
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hey All - 
     Unfortunately, Gertie's gas cap has been stolen. 
Does anyone know of a good place to get one quickly? 
I would like to replace with an original eventually
but need something right now!  Thanks!

Chrissie and Gertie ('78 Transporter)
