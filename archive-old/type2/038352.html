&gt;... Somehow this stuff is so slippery that it
&gt; can neutralize all manner of crud and even after the oil had been drained
&gt; and the coolant hoses cut, it still ran perfectly.
&gt; ...The engine ran crappy due to a half-a**ed hot rod job so I poured the
bottle
&gt; in as insurance until I could inspect the engine and convert it back to
&gt; stock. When the oil light came on during L.A. freeway traffic and the
&gt; courteous drivers would not let me get to the shoulder, I didn't panic
&gt; because hey, at least there are no rocks in my crank case. When I finally
&gt; got to the shoulder the Motor Up was rapidily exiting through a fist sized
&gt; hole in the crank case.  According to the commercial, I should have been
&gt; able to make it to Phoenix and back in that condition.

I love the demonstrations wherein they run the engine with no oil and
water.  Ever notice that they never do the same demonstration with an
engine not using the snake oil?  Engines can take a lot of abuse as long
as you don't care about what the engine is like a few miles down the road.
