Just had a complete tune-up done on my new bus and it seems to be running a
lot better, but I still feel some hesitation in 2nd, 3rd, and 4th gears.
When I try to get on the highway I am lucky to be doing 40 when I merge.  I
can get it up to 65 but that is it.  I read the other day how someone was
able to cruise at 70 all day long, how?  The second I start going up the
slightest grade I am down to 55.  This is my first VW so maybe I just don't
understand, but I am sure these things have a little more power.

What should I do, look at, etc?

My machanic said to oil something in the distributer, that might be what is
causing the hesitation.
I am new to this, and didn't want to sound like an idiot in front of him so
I said I understood, well I don't, what do I oil?  This is a brand new
distributor, what should I be looking at?

Thanks,
Bob
