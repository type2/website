Subject: Re: [T2] Ball joint advice.

Been here done that got a nice ride for it!! Its a PITA to do so if you got
the money and no time I would leave this one to the pros... But if you got
time and no $$$ my case its a good job to tackle but be sure you got a good
source of local help.

&gt;1) I assume I should do upper and lower at the same time. Are
they the same part number? I think so.

I got mine as a set all four for one price from wolfsburg.

&gt;2) Is it worth it to get the German parts?

Isn't it always better to get German. In this case with the $$ you are going
spend and the trouble your going go thru to install them, its a very good
idea to get the best possible.

&gt;3) What else do I need to order? I do not want to be stuck half way through
this job and not have the parts ready. Muir says something about the front
stabilizer bar parts that need be replaced.

I ordered the needle bearings and the front stabilizer bar mounting kit. I
had a problem getting the kit to fit back on right. I ended up having to
send the kit back and getting them from bus boys (I think that's where I got
them) So if you got some extra its worth buying two and sending the unneeded
back.

&gt;4) Any insight would be great.

Have a good place to work on it shielded from the elements of nature because
your going be there awhile. Also get some brakes parts cleaner and engine
degreaser. I also redid my brake shoes and wheel bearings when I did this
job. Everything was off so why not. Also I never would have made it if not
for a good second opinion and insight.

Hope this helps. Its a definite deference when your done. My bus shook like
an earthquake if you hit a sewer cap till you came to a dead stop. What's
the craziest thing is the young PO drove from AZ to AL with it like that.
