&lt;&lt;  (3) Any thoughts on the Goodyear Aquatred II or the Goodyear
 Integrity?
 &gt; I'm looking for a nice street tire, with good grip and quiet.
 
 They have nifty advertising campaigns.  Other than that, you'd be
 better off with the Yokohama or Bridgestone 185R14s.  They'll probably
 be less expensive too. &gt;&gt;

I actually thought the Aquatred gig was a gimmick myself to, until I bought a
bus with them already installed. These are pretty nifty tires!  I am currently
living in Oregon where it pretty much rains at least 8 months out of the year.
I have noticed that my 69' camper (Albert) corners and stops much better with
the Aquatreds (no more sliding into intersections-but watch for flying coffee
cups).   An I'm talking a fully over loaded camper here-kids, wife and all
there unnecessary gear.  I like these tires and highly recommended them if you
have to much money laying around..but then again you have to remember that I
got my tires for pretty darn near free! (bought a bus for $800, sold the bus
for $1,500-kept the tires)
    Peace, Love, and the wheels on the bus goes round and round, round and
round---
