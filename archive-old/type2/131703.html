Subject: RE: [T2] How to check a loose trans and how to set shifter?

&gt;From: benthin_at_prodigy_dot_net

&gt;The 75 worked OK with the later geared 091, 22 mpg, and I'd like to use the 
&gt;76- how does
&gt;one actually test these off the car?

I am very interested in this as well. I saw on vbay two weeks ago a tool 
used to hand turn the tranny for testing purposes. I was tempted to buy it 
but I got some other stuff needed instead. The tool was made by VW and 
looked like egg profile. The bigger side had a hole in it with teeth to 
match the spline an the smaller end had a handle to crank with. It would be 
easy to make such a device, but how do you test the transmission out of the 
bus or in the bus when not driveable?

Thanks,

Michael Knight
