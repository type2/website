Subject: RE:Gas guage calibration, troubleshooting

I have a guage in a 71 that is inconsistant, for the first few miles
(minutes)
it reads too high, then it comes down.  If it is anything I can
understand,
it's likely the temperature of the system affects some resistance that
is
decreased over time and gives lower readings, or does the resistance
make a
higher reading?  I'm thinking it's easy to trade the guage in the dash
vs the
tank as a blind test before I do more.  Been living with it as had the
PO.
