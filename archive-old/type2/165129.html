Subject: Question on seat upholstery reinstallation

&gt;Dear List,
&gt;My wife and I are working on completing a long-outstanding project -- 

&gt;reupholstering the front seats of our 1973 camper.....

I re-skinned my front bucket seats a few years ago.
When I saw your photo, it reminded me of the work.

There is a hem in the upholstry fabric which has a strong
wire inside.  And on the seat frame are metal barbs shaped
like triangles.  The fabric is stretched enough that the wire
goes over the barbs.  Then force the barbs through the fabric.
Hammer the barbs over the wire to hold the wire in place and
smooth out their sharpness.

I remember that the driver seat frame had one place with really
long barbs.  This was to hold down TWO wires.  One wire and
fabric was attached and the barbs halfway hammered down.
Then fabric and wire from the other direction was attached
to the same barbs.  Carefully with these barbs, they can
break off if you hammer and pry up, hammer and pry up again and
again.  Especially with these long barbs which are bent in two
different directions.

I suppose that if the barbs are lost you could try using baling
wire or zip ties to attach the upholstry wire to the seat frame.
