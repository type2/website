&gt; Alright, I'm joining this discussion late, but here
&gt; goes my two cents worth...
&gt; 
&gt; My light on the dash with a &quot;B&quot; on it only works when I've
&gt; got the parking brake engaged. The rest of the time, it
&gt; never comes on. I'm guessing this light tells when the
&gt; parking brake is engaged.
&gt; 
&gt; Am I right?

Not necessarily.  You really don't want to see the light any other time.
Yes, it does tell you when the parking brake is engaged on the later
Buses.  But it also tells you when there is a serious pressure loss in
the brake system.  If there is such a pressure loss, it will light up
when you push the brake pedal.  Of course, you won't need the light
because as you find the pedal going all the way to the floor and bus not
stopping, the light will be superfluous :-)
