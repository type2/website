Subject: Listee in Bellingham?

Hi, Are there any listees in Bellingham WA? If so, and you would be willing
to have parts shipped to your place and picked up by me please respond. I am
in Vancouver Canada and am encoutering problems with shipments to Canada
from US. It is only a 40 minute drive for me to Bellingham which would
amount to less of my time money than the alternative, plus I would get the
parts sooner and most importantly, some people will not ship to Canada or
the cost is outrageous. If you can help, I will be sure to make the
transaction painless and costless to you. 
Bob
