Subject: '68 bus brake parts questions.

Hi!

   I had a question regarding the brake system on my newly aquired '68.  I'm going through the front brakes and master cylinder.

   I'm budget minded and I'm hoping to use parts that I already have

  The questions I have are:

1.  Can I use brake hose that are designed for a '67 (211611701) or are they too short?  long?  ( '68 hose 211611703) 

2. Can I use a '73 and later servo master cylinder to replace my '68 brake master cylinder?

3.  Any tips, hints, or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Please email directly to me as I am not a member of the Type2 list but I'm one of those 'early guys'

THANKS

-Roger
