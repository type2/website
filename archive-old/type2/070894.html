Hello listees,

I know that this has been discussed, but I probably wasn't paying enough 
attention at the time as I didn't know I had a problem.  

I have a specific question and need some advise.  I went to get estimates on 
painting my 72 bay window bus and found that I have a rust hole in floor of 
the front passenger side of the bus.  It is where the floor starts to round 
up towards the seat and is rectangular in shape, about 1/4 to 1/2 inch wide 
and 5 inches long.  Will POR15 work for this type of rust?  If so, should it 
be put on the both sides of the floor?  I have some other rust areas about 
the same size, but the rust  has not gone completely though yet.  It will be 
about $300 for the 3 areas that need work if I have the bad sections cut out 
and new ones placed in.  POR15 sounds cheaper, easier and more rewarding if I 
do it myself.  Any help is always appreciated.

Thanks,
Rob :-)
