hey volks, 
i have a great idea. i think all of us type 2 listees should put a little sign
in our windshields at jerome so we can recognize each other. i think its so
neat to put a face to the friendly(?) chit chat and advise.  
if you see a 72 blue westy anywhere from miami, fl to jerome thatll be me and
the wife. stop me and say hi. 

marty and the wife :)~(:    72 westy (among others)
