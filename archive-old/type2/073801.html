&gt; The Gel type Optima batteries do not ruin your sheet metal if they leak.
&gt; This is the main reason a person will choose an Optima (or other gel-type
&gt; battery) IMHO.  If I have just repaired a floor pan in my beetle, or a
&gt; battery shelf in one of my busses, the last thing I want to do is do it
&gt; again.  With a gel-type battery, my battery shelf will not rust out from
&gt; battery acid ever again!!  I would rather spend $80 extra now, and have the
&gt; peace of mind that another rustoration will not have to be repeated.

Good point.  I had the same concern, so I bought a plastic battery box
from my FLAPS.  It keeps the nasty stuff inside and a little bicarb of
soda in the bottom neutralizes anything that gets out of the battery.

Works a treat, and cost about $10.

BTW, this is a good idea even with a &quot;sealed&quot; battery.  Even sealed
batteries will vent if they are too hot or overcharged.  This prevents the
cases from being ruptured.  Overcharging can happen if the regulator
fails.
