Subject: Re: [T2] Problem: Fan Belt Adjustment Nut

Travis-
You can extend your allen wrench with a 6mm deep socket
and a socket extension. You can also use an allen socket.
You may need some heat ( the &quot;hot wrench&quot;) and all the
disclaimers apply here. The most difficult fasteners
will break loose easily if you apply some heat and then
paraffin (an old candle). Best trick I know.
You may want to do some minor  engine tin disassembly
to have access to the nut and not burn the tin.
Then be sure to anti-sieze it for the next time..

&gt;  Is there a more
&gt; effective tool or method I should be using for this?  Anyone have any other
&gt; tips and tricks for loosening this nut?  Thanks for any help!
