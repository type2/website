Hi All

I'm looking to buy a '73 Riviera Campmobile with auto trans.  The
transmission seems faulty since you have to manually move it from 1 to 2
then to D.  If you try to start off at D it just chugs along.  So I'm
looking at having the transmission rebuilt and I'm wondering if I might as
well just replace it with a standard.  Is this an easy swap???

Thanks


Erich
