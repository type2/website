&gt;&gt;Another minus is that it's difficult to make paint stick to the case.  My
&gt;&gt;ill-fated GEX engine was painted (badly) and the paint peeled from the
&gt;&gt;sump in strips.
&gt;
&gt;This is the bit that bothers me about all this, if the interface between the
&gt;case and paint is imperfect (how can it be otherwise) then surely a loss of
&gt;effective heat transmission follows. I would be seeking truly expert advice
&gt;here before risking the loss.

GEX (and AVP's for that matter) spray paint jobs aren't all that impressive.
On a cleaned (as in cold dipped or pressure cabinet washed) T1 case, paint
will stick wonderfully if applied carefully, and ideally doing little
things like
masking the fastener locations with old hardware while painting, the jug
mating surfaces, any gasket surfaces, etc.  I'd do it by hand with thinned
black paint.

Aluminum cases are different, to get real long term quality adhesion you
need first the dip or the pressure clean then you need to Alodine the case.
Alodine is a relatively cheap brush on aluminum conversion coating that will
itself forestall a lot of corrosion, but not in a real long term sense.
You can
get it at a good machine supply place, or more commonly from your local
PPG auto paint (and I'd guess other brands as well) retailer.  PPG sells it as
their aluminum prep stuff to be used prior to painting in two styles one for
wheels that will only be clearcoated and one that yellows the surface, this
is the one you want.  A quart is pretty $teep from PPG maybe $15+ or so but
can be used in a dishpan and recylcled nearly indefinitely in a home use
sense as long as what you are applying it to is spotless.  You can follow
with paint of your choice afterwards.  But then again the aluminum cases
doesn't corrode that badly even in the salt belt anyway so I'm relatively
undecided on the merits of T4 case painting.  T1's or tranny cases with
magnesium, DEFINITELY need painted for corrosion alone, not to mention
any possible cooling benfits.  The Alodine alone is a good idea regardless,
at the rocket ranch we used it alone often on prototype parts that were only
intended to have corrosion resistance for a few years, anything more was
anodized or hardcoated (thick anodize.)

I'm no expert, but I've painted a few things now and then from cases to cars.
