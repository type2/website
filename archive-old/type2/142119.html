Subject: Re: [T2] help 72 bus - still no power

Does anyone have pictures of the engine compartment
I need to figure out where the timing marks are supposed to be -- what vacuum 
lines are supposed to be there and where they are supposed to be


My 72 is still not running properly

Folowing suggetions completed

Fuel Filter  -- I have checked the fuel filter - it only has a little one in 
the fuel pump (can't find a replaceable fuel filter)
Van sat for 12 years

timing  --  I can't check the timing yet - I need pictures as the scale for 
adjusting the timing seems to have been rubbed off.  It seems to run fairly 
smooth since I finished the tank of premium fuel and put in regular (I got 
that from Muir's -should have read it first) 


Compression  --  not done yet - I hesitated because I need a tester with a 
long reach to get at the plug holes and the van ran well with lots of power 
when I first tried it out  -  during the test driving.  I did overheat it.  
The coil spun in it's bracket and shorted out intermittently.   

Valves adjusted - they were all too tight.

tune-up  --  did the points, condensor, rotor, cap, wires - coil has spark
oil change, filter and oil screen cleaned

new oil leaks around the oil screen now (need to get the seal) and oil 
pressure valve  --  Muir's says there are two valves - I can only find the 
main one
 

carbs  --  dual carbs - opened and junk cleaned out of the bowls

The engine has no guts - like it is lugging too big a load

No gas smell in the oil 

No knocking sounds 

Max speed is 40 mph on the falt  --  15mph on steep hills

I am reading Muirs again -- must have missed something
