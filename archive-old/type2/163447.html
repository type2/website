&gt; Has anyone used header wrap on heater boxes from a 1971 1600cc bus to
&gt; retain more heat in the system? Thanks.
&gt; 

Yes, but not anything commercial, just fiberglass batting wired around the
boxes. What really made the bus &quot;hot&quot; was a three speed Blazer heater
motor mounted in the spare tire well and ducted thru' a hole into the 
engine compartment. I capped off the ducts on the doghouse...The
engine fan was only used to cool the engine. The air from inside the bus
was blown thru' the heater boxes and thru' the (insulated) center tube
to the front of the bus. Since the Blazer fan kept recirculating the air
in the bus, it got very warm and I could actually de-ice the outside of
the windshield from within. Noisy tho' so unless it was extremely cold,
I kept the fan on the lowest of its three speeds... ;-)
