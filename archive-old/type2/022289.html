I drove part of the east coast of Italy around Bari. I lived in Naples for 
3 years.

The place seems to be the wilds of Italy. Pretty sparse but at least you 
are driving a VW and there should be good repair service everywhere if you 
need it.

Right south of Brindisi is a region full of chestnut groves. Gorgeous 
travelling if you stay on the small highways. Try the Via Aurelia. Very 
flat and much drier than the western parts I travelled more commonly. There 
used to be a US base there - a communications base. I don't remember the 
name but I can look it up if it is important.

Are you US military? (I want to move back over someday --- civilian DOD 
contractor or something...)

Be sure to keep the tanks full as - in my opinion - the Agip gas stations 
(the only stations our GI issue gas coupons were good at) were not as 
common as in the denser populated areas.

Beware - my friend in Naples tells me that gas is right around $5.15 a 
gallon right now.

&gt;Have any of you fellow Dubbers done this trip or doing it as I want to meet
&gt;as many of you as possible on this trip so where are the best place's to go,
&gt;I will follow the coast I expect hoping to find some surfer's and learn to
&gt;surf.
&gt;Also I have a palmtop to take with me so how do I go about getting an ISP
&gt;for these countrie's and how do I access this list because it could be handy
&gt;if I hit problems
&gt;Thank's Banny
