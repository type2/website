Subject: Hydraulic Valve Adjusting

Hi Volks,

Having a problem with the archives so here goes.

I have hydraulic lifters on my '78 and AVP, the fine builder of my
enginge, says to adjust them to one turn.

Having never attempted a valve job before and with Muir as my guide I am
guessing that one turn means to tighten the valves all the way then back
off one full turn. No use of feeler gauges.

Is this a correct assumption?

TIA
