Subject: Replacing heater Cables '76
Message-ID: &lt;381346BC.CF6AED1C_at_snowcrest_dot_net&gt;

    Here is what I have learned about heater cable replacement on my '76
Westy (3 months new 2 me).

In my '60 Type 2, many years ago, it was a 'U' shaped wire that hooked
to the heater control knob, but things have come a long way since then.
My bently manual just blew over it as 'body stuff' and after fighting it
at first, had to examine it it the (DM) way so I could experience 'far
fig newtons'.

It begins:

Remove the belly pan.The more bolts you have holding your belly pan on
the luckier you are, mine had 2 :(. The two metal tubes, that carry the
cable from the front to the rear, begin under the belly pan. The third
cable does not have a tube, and only goes to the front-rear heat lever
half way along the heat conduits. The tubes are at the rear of the area
the belly pan covered. I tried to spray lubricant into these as well, to
help forstall corrosion. I first slipped the cables into these tubes
until they stuck out the rear, but the front assembly must be done
before the rear.

The cables go through a special hole in the floor above and to the rear
of where the wiring harness enters the cab and should be fed up from
below. All cables should be layed and curved as smoothly as possible to
avoid any constriction. There are two small white plastic clips attached
to the underside of the floor beside the accelerator cable to snap the
heater cables into.

 The left cable has a metal L shaped hook, and the right a wire ring.

Remove the carbboard kick plate covering the wiring to feed the cables
up to the heater consol behind the dash. The hook slips into a hole on
the left side of the back of the central control lever (a very difficult
place to maneuver in) and the wire ring slips over it from the other
side, held on by a tiny circlip that takes the zen of Buddha to remove
and replace. Maybe it would be easier to remove the consol, but I was
chicken.

Just below this is a nifty cable holder with a clip. The cable housing
ends of the four cables are metal and fit inside the holder and are a
little difficult to get lined up perfectly so the clip can be snapped
over them. After getting this all re-assembled you can proceed to the
rear.

 At the rear where the metal tube ends are 4 components. In order from
the rear: The screw clamp holding the cable to the heat exchanger lever.
A soft rubber 'accordian' that seals in a special brass groove in the
cable at one end, and over the end of the next component, a half rubber
half steel tube that fits tighly over the metal tube that runs from the
front. Inside this is a small white plastic seal that slips over the
cable and inserts tightly INSIDE the tube so that the cable housing
rests against it. It seems VERY (DM)

The first cable I tried to use was not good. It did not feel good when I
bought it, it really DRAGGED in the cable housing even laying flat and
straight. It had a nylon covering over the wire. It was harder to pull
once in was in, with all the twists and turns, and quickly pulled the
metal cable end from the end of the cable. (probably bad manufacture).
The second cable I got was very free moving, just a stainless wire
inside the housing, and I had an easier time spraying silicone into it
because of the extra room. So be sure the cable moves easliy within the
housing before you buy it.

Good luck
