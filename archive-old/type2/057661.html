&lt;&lt; &lt; Multi &quot;cartural&quot; question...
  I have a 1972 Westy... I have a 1987 Toyota Celica GTS...
  The Toyota is available for parts. The Toy dash has all the gauges I
  wish my West had.
  
  Question: is it possible to make it work (using the Toy dash and 
  gauges in place of the Vw's)??? 
  
  I think that fitting the Toyota dash panel to the West is possible 
  (with some work... evidently),  but my question is about connecting 
  or adapting the speedometer, the oil pressure gauge, the engine temp, 
  the fuel gauge the tachometer and the idiot lights. 
  Is that possible???  Any adaptor necessary? If so are they 
  available? Has anyone already done that? Any advice.... 
  
  Thank you
   &gt;&gt;
 My advice-
 Sell the bus, fix the Toyota.

Okay everybody, perhaps I was a little too curt in my reply....unfortunately
it struck me as absurd, and we all should be glad this isn't happening on the
vintagebus list, for we'd all be burned at the stake.
Dennis, I would ask myself the following before attempting this:
Is this all neccessary? I know the lowly aircooled VW's are a little sparse in
the instrumentation, but there are other ways of knowing how the engine is
doing. Yes, you could stick a tach in the clock area, and add a gauge mount
under the dash for the oil temp and pressure, but why? Driving your bus and
paying attention to it will give you just as much information. Checking your
oil, touching the dipstick, noticing if it acts up slightly on a warm day
would accomplish the same. That's just part of the mystique of the VW bus.
It's not a modern day Honda, and you have to pay more attention to it than
that.
I wish you well,
