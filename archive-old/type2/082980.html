&gt; &gt;today i spent some time checking out the bus. nothing
&gt; serious, however i was running the engine, and i
&gt; noticed hissing noises come from the rear of the
&gt; engine(that is, the side closest the the rear bench
&gt; seat and gas tank). what the?!  im thinking-
&gt;      power loss + hissing noises = vacuum leaks

&gt;
&gt; Matty,
&gt; Do not get confused by the 'noise' of air moving thru the thin wall of the
&gt; plenum. The plenum is the black chamber on the top middle with the 4 intake
&gt; runners coming out of it. The wall is so thin, you will swear there is a
&gt; vacuum leak there....

Matty,

I agree with Karl 100%.   In addition, the sound of air &quot;leaking&quot; between
the idle adjustment screw and the throttle butterfly can really fool you.

Really the only way to tell that you have a vacuum leak is to hook up a
vacuum gauge and see what it says.  Before  you do, iit is always a good
idea to set dwell, timing and idle speed.  Then plug in the gauge and see
if you  have 15+  inches of vacuum.  If you do, then nothing is seriously
leaking.

A vacuum leak will usually not cause a loss of power, at least not
directly. It will cause your engine to run leaner and thus hotter, and
once you  burn a valve or punch a hole in a piston, well, *then* you have
a definite loss of power, but fixing the leak will not cure it.
