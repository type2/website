Subject: MANASAS BUG Out List Members Going?

&gt;I know I'm a little premature on this one but I'm going to be in San Diego on
&gt;business next week and would like to meet up with as many list
&gt;members as I can.  If there are members who are going we should try to
&gt;tie up or caravan down there.  I'm in Annapolis and it is a holiday

Like clockwork, I will be there. I dont think I will 'show' my bus this
year, but if there is a great outcry, I can, and will provide drinks,
chips, place to ditch finds for a while, shade, companionship, etc.
for the day. My bus is no 'show bus', and I got two whole points last
year, one for driving in under my own power, and the other
for 'gauges and electronics'. Out of 100 points. But, I did have 
burgers on the grill, soda in the cooler, lawn chairs, and shade!
Douglas B. may be coming with me. He wants me to 'show' again this
year, so we can gate crash early for good parts picking before the 
general admission lets in. I still dont know what I am doing.

&gt;weekend so I would  definately consider camping.  Also as Paul Wies

Camping is cool, and a couple of local Westy guys get together out
at the battlefields, but I dont know exactly what camp ground.

&gt;has pointed out that the Dave Matthews Band is playing 10 minutes

You better be rich, that show sold out in 2 hours.

&gt;away that Sunday night. There is a campground 2 minutes from Nissan
&gt;Paviliion where I have camped before. In addition this Friday at 10:35
&gt;eastern time on TBS they are showing Fast Times at Ridgemont High. 
&gt;Spicolli drove a bus, plus its a classic.

The only time I have had that much smoke in my bus is when
the engine caught fire with the heater on. But, I did come staggering
out, just like Mr. Spicolli, and it was in the school parking lot.
