I've had a chance to speak with the only Type 2 at last years event.  
Needless to say they were lonely.  This year proves to be a much better 
event.  This is just a reminder to those coming that I will be at the Morro 
Dunes the night of the 15th.  I f you would like to join me feel free.  
Please try to attend as it's going to be fun.  If you are going to attend 
please e-mail.  If you need more info please feel free to contact me as well.
Peace Out
Rick
