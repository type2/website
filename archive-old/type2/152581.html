Subject: Re: [T2] Starting Problems

Dave,

Thanks for the response.

&gt; Hmmmm...So how certain are you that the distributor drive is in the right
&gt; place in relationship to the #1 at TDC(on the combustion stroke)??

I'm not 100% certain and will verify, although I suspect that if I'm not in the right place, I'm 180deg out.  

IIRC, I should see the #1 intake closing as I approach TDC then the #1 exhaust opening as I continue turning the engine over, correct?  Same for #2 except with BDC?  (Both to be cross-ref'd with verified with the location of the distributor rotor/wires, of course)

&gt; Spark should always be verified at the spark plug end.
&gt; The results of that test tell you whether the condesor is working or not.

That didn't occur to me but makes sense.

Regarding the idle cut-off solenoid: I have in fact verified that it works (in so much that it clicks when you add or remove 12v power to it).

Cheers,  

     Tom
