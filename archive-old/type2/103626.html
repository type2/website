&gt; Anyone ever taken off the fuel injection system on a

why??  the FI system is the system designed for the 2 liter engine and no
matter what you do with carbs you will never be able to get it to run as
well as it will with the FI system (assuming normal driving)

however if you do decide to swap the systems, let me know so I can make an
offer for the FI system you remove
