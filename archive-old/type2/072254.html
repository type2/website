Subject: doublecab gasket availability

new news on this: part number is 265 841 819A off the bus boys' fiche. word
is, that it is specific to the rear door opening on the chassis. if any of
our dealers can lay hands on it, i'd love to hear. it sptopped being
reproduced seven years ago, which isn't too long - may be on the shelf.   -

&gt;Subject: [T2] doublecab gasket availability
&gt;
&gt;hi - i am wondering whether a certain 68+ rear cab door gasket is still
&gt;available for a doublecab. it is the gasket that lives on the chassis,
&gt;across the bottom of the door. this is not ON the door; it is below the
&gt;floor and above the rocker. i crosspost this in case the splittie crew
&gt;knows whether it is the same on their cargo doors, and can be cut to the
&gt;length i need which is 22.5 inches. or perhaps it is the same length in the
&gt;pre68 doublecabs.
&gt;BIGthanks - steve
