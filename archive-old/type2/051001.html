Subject: RE: [T2] CIS for Bus

I had the privilege of dropping by Mark Fitzsimons house a few weeks ago and
he has this very system installed on his 78 Westy. It was the nicest FI
system I have seen. It looked like it was factory installed. The parts fit,
they hooked up good, the system was very clean. He reports good power and
MPG. Ask Him about it, he will give you more info than I can. He is on the
list.
