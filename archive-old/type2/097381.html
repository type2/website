Subject: Re: [T2] Friday question (was Re: [T2] Top speed)

I don't know about being intimidated by faster drivers,
I kind of like being pointed at, getting peace signs and smiles.
I guess that's why I have added big Smiley faces in the back window.
And Oh what fun is was to drive dressed up like Santa Claus.

The way I figure it is that as the other cars go by, they can't help but to
look over at a piece of beautiful Americana.
As owners of old VW's, buses in particular, we have all experienced the
strangers at gas stations.
You know the ones with their own VW story.
I particularly like our senior citizens and their &quot;I used to have one of
those...&quot;
I don't think there is a real red blooded American guy that doesn't have a
VW story to tell.
Later,
Jim
