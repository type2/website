Subject: The hubcap, my house and the Auburn Hills show

Of all the hubcap signees, I'll bet I had it the least.  I got it from Chris
Huff (who still gets a pat on the back for her work with it) and did no more
than walk it across the the VWofA parking lot at one of the Auburn Hills
shows and give it to Jamie Rivers.  But I get a great kick out of the way
it's wandering around, showing up here and there, getting lost but not
loosing.

My own busdom is in the same fix:  kind of lost but still there, somewhere.
Got through my plumbing rough inspection on my house rebuild except for one
relatively easy fix.  A little rough carpentry, inspection, then insulation,
etc.  It's not all that different than fixing up a bus, only bigger.

And eventually, my new house will show up 'across the Mississippi' and I can
get back to busing like I should.

I'll try to make it to the Auburn Hills show again, say hi to any listees.
You Wisconsin folks going to camp out again?  Maybe I can find it in the
dark this time.  If you don't mind being an hour north of the show, at least
a couple are welcome to camp in the driveways of my two houses (two blocks
apart) in Flint.  Nice neighborhood, you won't be bothered.

Bus on.
