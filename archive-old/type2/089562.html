Subject: RE: [T2] patterns for panels

It's not that hard  - I cut and installed 3 interior panels in a morning
using the existing ones for patterns. I just need patterns. I imagine the
installation may include some minor pain and anguish, but not making them. 


&gt;Save yourself alot of pain and anguish and just buy some restoration Panels
&gt;from the Bus Depot.
