&gt; I am having a similar problem with fuse #8.  I have
&gt; blown 2 of them even with everything turned off. I
&gt; popped in a new one and that one blew immediately.

      That's a sign that replacing the fuse and continuing
      on is NOT cutting it!

&gt; There is a fan mounted to the dash and it
&gt; was on when the first one blew (I was driving at
&gt; the time). My question is how do you trace
&gt; down the problem?  Do you unplug everything or
&gt; should you be able to shut off the lights, fans, etc.
&gt; and then turn each one on until you find the
&gt; problem?

       Sounds like a short somewhere, but I don't
       know where. I have my radio and fan on the
       far RIGHT fuse, that was the one used for
       (frivolous) accessories in my '69 bug, too...
       How much spare time do you have? If not
       much, take it to a VW-friendly electrical
       place(someplace that KNOWS what they're
       doing, not eager learners!)...
