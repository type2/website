Hey People,

Ok I'm trying to get something straight here. This has to do with the oil
screen on a type IV. What I have is a BOLT not a 'screw' that screws up into
a long 'nut' that has threads all the way through and this screws up into a
stud inside the block. This nut is long enough to fit through the center of
the oil screen and butt up next to the plate in which you then screw the
bolt into and torque down.  I recently aquired this bus and when I unscrewed
this bolt I noticed streams of permatex gasket coming off at that moment I
was thinking 'oh #_at_#!!'. In any case I'm trying to aquire the 'nut' and
'bolt' for this and haven't been able to find it. 

Everyone I've talked to says that it's a 'screw' and not a bolt and they
don't have such of a thing listed.The problem is the long hex shaped 'nut'
is stripped out from the inside. The 'stud' looks to be ok as I can take the
retaining screw that was shipped to me and screw it on with no problems
however it's not long enough to catch and hold everything in place. Can
anyone point me in the right direction on part #'s or what to actually ask
for or any ideas how to make what I have work without using form-a-gasket?  

Thanks!
