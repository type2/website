The continue this thread...

I took a look at vacuum can from Autozone (Wells RV1001). Sure enough Bosch
Germany and luckily this can had the part number on the arm along with the
110 number that denotes the arm itself.

2447 is stamped on the arm which Karl tells me is 1 237 122 447 (07 206).

This maps to a bunch of mid-80's watercooled VWs. I'm wondering:

A) Is what you get from Wells a mystery part every time?
B) Is there a Wells number for a vacuum can for the bus?

I put the can under the mityvac and it seems to move from 5-9&quot;; similar to
the other cans I've tested. I haven't mounted it to a test distributor to
measure the advance (rigged for no mech. advance) but when I do I'll post
the specs.

I searched the web for 07 206 and found it for $12-13. If you need a new
vacuum can, it seems like a good buy.

Wells website doesn't have any information &lt;http://www.wellsmfgcorp_dot_com/&gt;.
Does anyone have a catalog that x-ref's their part numbers to Bosch? Maybe
I'll call and try to request it.
