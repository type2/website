Subject: Battery Light

Help,
My battery on my 76 went flat so I charged it. Now the battery light is on
before the ignition key is turned and when the ignition is turned to on the
battery light goes out and the oil light comes on.
Needless to say it does not turn over.
Any suggestions as to what is wrong.
thanks
Jeff
