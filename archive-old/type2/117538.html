&gt; FWIW Bob I had a similar problem in my 78 manual a few months ago. My buddy
&gt; and I drove to Rhode Island from DC and was getting htis weird occassional
&gt; hesistation like water in gas or an occasional misfireing injector. On the
&gt; trip home it became a little more persistant but not enough to really
&gt; inconvenience us just annoying b/c we could not figure it out. When I got

right, no misfiring or sound even, 

&gt; home I took a close look at my points and even though the dwell was fine as
&gt; was timing they were pretty worn. I replaced them and the problem
&gt; dissappeared. Doesnt necessarily mean it was points though, I did the cap

I have Pertronix points replacer, my understanding is they are all or
nothing when they fail they totally fail, I may be wrong but I will check
