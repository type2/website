Subject: Belly pan removal ('62 23-Window)

Hello to all.
We purchased a 1962 23-Window deluxe a couple of months ago
and are now in the midst of doing some mechanical work
and also some work to stop some rust from worsening. 

The bus had no real serious rust (that we've found so far
anyway), but some slight rust through in the front floor pan 
on the passenger side and a few spots with surface rust
which we've taken measures to stop from getting worse.

The bus has a belly pan and we'd like to get it off to see 
whether it is concealing any more serious rust.  There was
onl surface rust spots on the upper side of the floor
pan in the cargo area (and apprently only surface rust
in the underside where the belly pan doesn't cover), but it 
could be getting worse in the areas we can't see b/c of
the pan.

How does one remove the belly pan?  I found no fasteners
(i.e. screws) anywhere.

If anyone has any advice on how to remove the belly pan,
we'd love to hear about it.  If any of the books (at
the moment we have only the Muir book) cover such work,
we like to hear that too.

Thanks.

Brian and Stephanie
