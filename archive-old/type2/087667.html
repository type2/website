Subject: RE: [T2] AVP Engine Swap Experience (long) Part 1.

Well, I am glad that I am not the only one that didn't know this. Lou (my mechanic) was pretty =
harsh on me about this one &quot;everyone knows that...&quot;, etc.

I think you are supposed to support the rear (bell housing side) of the trans with a jack during =
engine removal, then use a coathangar or something to support it once you have the engine out and =
the jack out. The idea is that by dropping the trans a few inches, the engine can kind of slide =
out at an angle.=20

I didn't do this, and I found that the muffler and top of the fan housing wanted to hit the body =
of the bus before the bottom studs were clear of the transmission. I guess if you removed the =
muffler and maybe the fan housing first then it would clear OK. It was only with a lot of wiggling =
and slightly damaging one of the trans holes that I got it out. The process did not look very =
professional. Maybe there is more than one way to do this correctly?

&gt;&gt; needed to be. I did learn a few useful things: There are 6
&gt;&gt; bolts (not 4) at the front of the engine that need to be
&gt;&gt; removed. The four that hold the engine to the trans everyone
&gt;&gt; knows about. However to properly remove the engine, you must
&gt;&gt; also remove two bolts on top of the trans that hold the trans
&gt;&gt; to the frame. The idea is that you are supposed to put a jack
&gt;&gt; under the trans and lower it a few inches, which will allow
&gt;&gt; everything to be removed smoothly. I removed my engine
&gt;&gt; without doing this which is not supposed to be possible.
&gt;&gt; That's part of why the engine removal was such a bear.
&gt;
&gt;Hmm, I'm not sure if I understand.  I've only removed mine (a '79)
&gt;once, but I just removed the 4 bolts (and the engine bearer) and it
&gt;came right out, and I did read the manual.
&gt;
&gt;If you removed the tranny mounts, how did you secure the tranny when
&gt;the engine was out?  Ooh, that just reminded me of a question for the
&gt;list that I'll post later ...
