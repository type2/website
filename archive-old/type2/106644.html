From: &lt;tjaspers_at_ameripath_dot_com&gt;
&gt; I think I may be missing something. I'd like to install an aftermarket
radio, and I've run into a problem. When I look at the radio opening in the
dash, I notice that there is no bracket behind it to bold the radio to.
There is just a rectangular opening. Is there supposed to be some sort of a
bracket behind there?

I just moved my radio (older Radio Shack type, hopefully so out of date that
thieves will look, laugh &amp; leave it) from the Sentra to &quot;G&quot;, and had to
enlarge the opening a little bit (it actually hurt to make the cuts!).  The
radio came with a metal sleeve that fits/locks into the opening in the dash,
and the radio slides/locks into the frame.

The instructions say to use the metal strap on the back of the radio to
secure it, but in the years of use in the Sentra, the strap was never
needed.  In the bus, the angle of the installation seems to make the radio
even more secure in the frame, so I'm not using the strap this time, except
to hold wires up away from the brake mechanism.

I had to Dremel the corners of the radio's face plate to keep it from
stressing the plastic on the dash, but the Dremeled-off corners were done so
that you can't see the missing plastic unless you remove the radio from the
dash.

I was going crazy without music in the bus!  Eventually, I'll add the rear
speakers, but for now... bliss. :O)

I was under the impression that most new radios came with some sort of
universal installation bracket, like the slide-in thing that came with mine.
Have you looked at radios, yet?  You could pick one that comes with an
installation bracket.
