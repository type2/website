Subject: Re: Gas Heaters According to Kath  :-)

&gt;Well, don't answer, 'cause while I was writing this I called Joe at JB
&gt;and he was REAL polite (and remembers you well, Kath!) and told me they draw
&gt;6 amps.  That's alot, and this would only be suitable on a second battery.

Before I get flamed, let me say I only know what I learned in my high
school physics class about electricity (aka- not much at all).  Does Her
Majesty require a second battery?  Is this such a big deal?  Should I even
worry about it?  For some reason, I don't want to put another battery in,
but for that kind of heat and considering I don't have a camper either,
this is really exciting.  I guess I'm just glad to know there are a lot
more options on heat than I originally thought-
