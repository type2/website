Any fair race under these circumstances has to include a rebuild in 
parking lot of an Oklahoma City Wal-Mart. Single-handed. In late July. I 
don't think the Type IV crowd will be so smug in a situation like 
that. =^ )

Anyway the gentleman said his friend could get a free Type I engine to 
go in the engineless 74, so the economics are different than you're all 
proposing. The tinware is not that big a deal, it is available from Just 
Kampers, and I can't believe the moustache bar is that big a deal.

Perhaps Bob Wallace can add a different perspective as somebody who owns 
a *new* bay with a *new* 1600 in it. Well, new-ish.
