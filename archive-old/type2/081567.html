Subject: Re: re: por-15 on pop tops

Is POR15 less effective if it is not topcoated? I used it last year on some
carefully prepped rust spots and it is just coming right through. These
spots are exposed to the sun. It isn't clear in the directions about whether
it is damaged by UV or not, just that it changes color (it does). What has
been your experience on this?

&gt; i'd say go for it, that is the best darn stuff in the
&gt; world.  it does need to be topcoated though and would
&gt; use their top coating that way you wouldn't need to
&gt; use the tie coat between the two and it would be that
&gt; much tougher.  if you don't top coat it it turns
&gt; colors on you.  my silver under the bug turned slight
&gt; brown in some locations and would only be worse if
&gt; left in the direct sunlight.
