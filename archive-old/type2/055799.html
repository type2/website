Subject: Re: Worktop advice needed

If I had to do mine over, I'd go to Hood's (a discount everything place)
and buy a damaged counter top. They come with a back splash. You might even
want to get one with a hole for a sink and put an old porcelain sink in it
to wash parts in. You could hook up a pump to the drain and run the supply
to an old faucet. That way you could circulate the cleaner. Plus you could
make cut outs to cover the sink and use it as a work space. That would be
kick ass.
