Subject: don't bead blast pistons

Hello,

I have never had pistons dirty enough to need to be bead blasted.

I don't know if you have your own sand blast cabinet, which would make it
cheaper to sand (or glass) blast things, but I suggest you spend you money
and time on a better solution.

I am worried about unneccessary wear on the pistons, and grit stuck in the
tiny oil passages.

I suggest that you buy a real commercial mechanic type 5 gallon bucket sized
carburetor cleaner.

I just love my bucket of carb cleaner

I use it to clean much more than carburetors. I use it to clean all most all
the engine internal parts for an engine rebuild.

I clean the pistons, the rockers, solid lifters, the push rod tubes, all the
nuts and bolts, the rods, etc. All the parts come out super clean and
looking like brand new.

It is really fun to put together a really clean engine and the cleaning and
rinsing off time is worth spending to have that much fun.

I also think that getting rid of all that crude probably prolongs the engine
life in terms of cleaner oil with better lubricating and cooling properties
(but I can't prove this)
