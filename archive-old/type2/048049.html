Blue '74 Westy (originally that fluorescent yellow), green plaid
interior, complete and in decent condition, pop-top has only a couple of
very small holes, no apparent body rust. Engine looks clean, has 2 bbl.
single carb. Overall, bus is not perfect, but still pretty nice. Owner
is asking $3500. Please contact Tom Greene, 864-244-4105, not me...
