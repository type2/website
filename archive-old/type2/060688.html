&gt; Hi volks,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I received a phone call this afternoon from a Michelin &quot;Sales
Engineer&quot;, 
&gt; 
&gt;  A sales engineer, huh? Now there's a job title...
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;... this tire is 
&gt; &gt; available only by &quot;special order&quot;.  ...
&gt; &gt;...  He wasn't familiar with our specific requirements, and was 
&gt; &gt; surprised to learn that even late production Vanagons needed a
reinforced tire 
&gt; &gt; in the 185R14 size. ...
&gt; 
&gt;  This is ridicuous! There must be tens of thousands of vans rolling
around Europe (let alone the rest of the world) on 185R14Cs- they are
so common that I've seen them listed on the front page of those
freebie Used Car weekly newspapers in ads from tyre sellers
advertising cheap tyres in common sizes!!
&gt;  There are dozens of different models of tyre from many
manufacturers available in this size and the tyre market is about as
international as any.
&gt;  Sheesh! Only in America....

The problem is that here in the Youess we are relatively free to put
any tires we wish on our vehicles.  Most bus owners outside of the
list are really unaware of the unusual tire requirements of their VWs.
 If you go to a garden variety tire store they will happily sell you
185R14 passenger tires or 195/75R14 LT tires, since these are the
tires they have in stock.  They don't know (or care) that these tires
are not suitable for buses.  

I habitually check out every bus I see and only one in ten or so has
correct tires installed.  Most of the rest have passenger tires.  

Even though I live in Bus-rich SoCal, there are still only 20 or so
buses in my town.  Assuming that each bus gets new tires every two
years, this means that 10 sets of bus tires are sold every year (if
everyone used the correct tires).  We have about ten tires stores in
town, so that means that each store would have to stock a set of bus
tires on the chance that they will sell one set a year.  No tire store
is going to devote storage space to a product that sells so slowly,
particularly if they can talk the customer into buying a faster-moving
alternative size.

I do most of my business with a dealer who also happens to be the
distributor to the other stores in the area.  He's happy to get me the
tires I want, but I have to call him a couple of days in advance,
which isn't really all that bad of a lead time.  I keep two spares
around so I'm never really desparate for a new tire.
