&gt; hmm, seems honeys_dot_com has plundered my address from this list...damn.

This reminds me...  I've been able to track (via Snail Mail) just what 
places compile lists and &quot;sell&quot; my name to another company for advertising.
When I order from a certain place, I give them &quot;different&quot; ways to spell 
my name:

A. L. Lassley
E. L. Lassley
E. Lassley
Erin Lassley
Aaron Lassley
Erin L. Lassley
etc. etc.

I then will change addresses like so:

1222 n 15th
1222 N. 15th
1222 North 15th Street
1222 n 15 Street
etc. etc.

It's amazing that if you keep track of what places you give certain 
addresses to, you can soon see the advertisements from who-knows-where 
with your various addresses on them.  I know COMB and Damark both buy 
lists because I'll receive catalogs from them with all my various 
address combinations...
