Subject: replace original (nicked) window in '74?

Hello all,
I'm the proud new owner of a '74 Campmobile.  I've been lurking in this list
for a couple weeks, and I must say you are a very knowledgeable and friendly
group!

I'll be repainting one day, so I'll have the windows and interior out,
replacing rubber, etc.  Should I replace an imperfect windshield while it's
out?  It looks like it was hit w/ a stone (round mark smaller than a penny,
but the impact didn't cause the mini-crater on the inside of the windshield
that is typical of a hit like this).

The rest of the vehicle is stock, 1800cc engine &amp; blue green plaid interior.
If it seems wise to replace it, I was thinking of replacing it w/ a tinted
windshield.  But does it make more sense to just keep the original,
imperfect one?  Thanks for any and all opinions.
