My opinions on Elephant mirrors:

Ronnie Feitelson wrote:
 1. WCM these seem to be the best but they have
&gt; black arms, I was told by WCM that these are made for/by them, 

As with much of the WCM stuff, these are crap. But unlike the Roscoe's
below, they at least look a little like the original vwoa ones.

2. Roscoe
&gt; elephant ear mirrors, these have the strange clamp down system on the end of
&gt; the arm and are regularly found on buses that don't have the VWoA stamp on
&gt; the back, these have been made in New York by Roscoe since the bus came to
&gt; the U.S.A. or there about, 

I like these roscoe ones. They are a bit funny looking, but the quality
is SO much higher than WCM's mirrors.  Ronnie,( Thom, Ev, Clara, Steve,
whoever?) didnt these originally get put on east coast buses by dealers
as an upgrade before the vwoa mirrors?
