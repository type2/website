Hi David,
The air cleaners would probably fit if you used the KG turn downs for them.  
Though we will not use the stock Okrasa air cleaners for anything, but show 
and tell.  They just filter out the biggest stuff and let lots of small crud 
into wear out your cylinders.  We are looking at modifying some stocker early 
40 HP KG/bus air cleaners for each carb to do the job while driving.
