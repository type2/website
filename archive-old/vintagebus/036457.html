&lt;&lt; I know someone locally with a westy hitch who might sell, but I don't know 
if this hitch is heavy duty enough to tow a bug... BTW, a bug weighs in at 
just under 1800 lbs... &gt;&gt;
Hi David,
What type/year bug?  Our late 63 &quot;Without Guesswork&quot; list the 64 sedan at 
1675 Lbs. (760 KG), the cabrolet at 1786 Lbs. (800 Kg.), and the KG coupe at 
1808 Lbs. (820).  Both the bug sedan and the KG coupe we have extensively 
towed with the much lighter VOA style of hitch than the Westfalia hitch on 
both our 63 SC and 60 panel camper conversion.  When towing in a straight 
line on the flatter roads it is easy to forget you are towing.  We have to 
keep over and over remind ourselfs that we were to prevent going into a hard 
curve to fast or attempting to stop too later for the much heavier load.  
Especially since it it easy to jackknife the two VWs when panic stopping.
