&lt;&lt; There is a strong sharp rattle in the fan shroud or emanating from the
shroud itself at lower rpms.  The sharpness rounds out at higher rpms into
more of a thrum thrum thrum. &gt;&gt;

I have seen this at least a dozen times.  The fan is cracked under the nut.
This can be an easy fix without taking the engine out.  First take the half
of the pulley off generator.  Next slide a big ratchet and a 36mm socket
behind the fan shroud and onto the nut holding the fan to the hub, this can
also be done with a large crescent wrench.  Now with a wrench on the two
flat sides of the generator pulley hub and holding the big ratchet loosen
the fan.  don't remove the nut all of the way yet.  next remove the wiring,
generator strap and 4 screws holding the backing plate to the shroud.  now
very carefully with your had loosen the fan hub nut not letting any washers
fall into the shroud.  you should now be able to pull the generator out from
the rear again careful not to drop any washers or shims and leaving the fan
in the shroud.  You can now take the fan out and reverse the procedure to
replace it.  make sure the fan blades are the same size on the new fan as
the old one.
