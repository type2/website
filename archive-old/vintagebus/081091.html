Greasy Volks, 

SHAMELESS plug for &quot;Tom the Ewte&quot; Buese:

Eric, et al.  Tom's canvas tops for DC and SC cabs are really nice, to
as close as original spec as you can get.  Since Tom is an Architect by
profession, you might want to inquire as to various floorplans.  :-}

He's not in it for the moolah, either.  It's nice to be able to drive
to the VW shows, meets and swaps and be able to write off expenses
tax-wise.  Why didn't I think of that?  HECK, my wife has a $7000
Bernina sewing maching.  Eric, . . . you want yours embroidered with a
VW symbol, . . . how about a peace sign?   ;-}

PS:  Tom's blood runs Ewe of Ewe Red, and he claims his new best
friends are Urban Meyer and Ray Giacolleti.  However, after seeing Tom's
DC  being towed up I-15 by a Redneck Triple A tow Truck , neither claim
him as a friend.  (inside joke) 

Best,

Curt
