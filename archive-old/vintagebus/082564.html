Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [T2] the hubcap?

&gt; OK, I'm a newbie here.  Just what is this &quot;hubcap&quot; thing?  How did one
&gt; &quot;earn&quot; it?  Was it a joke or an honor? I'm seriously curious.  Could it
&gt; be a &quot;gimmick&quot; for our local club?

 It is a mounted vw hupcap w/ many signature, keepsakes, etc. attached that
is traveling the country as it is being passed from 1 volk to the next.  It
has been allll over the USA, but appears to be stuck in the SW for the last
couple of years. Come on youse guys, let's get that thing on the road again!

Tom-hoped to bring it to Utah once
