 Is there any way I can pull the generator assembly without dropping the
 engine?  I am to the point where I can not get the generator/plate/squirrel
 cage out without running into the intake manifold.  I have raised the shroud
 as high as it will go (only about 2inches belore I hit the top of the engine
 compartment).
 
 I think I am sc*ewed, but I thought I would try asking the seasoned pros out
 there before I summons the neighborhood kids to help.

Have you removed the carb?    Doing that tends to help.  

One way to do it is also remove the 36mm nut of the front (towards nose of 
bus) of generator.    hold pulley from turning like when you adjust fan belt. 
   Either you will loosen the nut, which SHOULD be at 80 ft lbs, or you will 
crack the hub for the generator pulley.     If it loosens the nut, carefully 
removed the nut and washers and keep them in order, you can pull the gen off 
the fan, and out of the bus.
