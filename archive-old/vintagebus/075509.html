Subject: Re: bus (still) does not idle

&gt;I'm running a 30/31 and don't have a idle problem but a starting problem.
&gt;It's like it's not getting enough gas and I have to pump to get it going.
&gt;I've cleaned it out and it hasn't helped.  Once going it's fine though.

I thought most cars with carbs and automatic chokes needed at least one
good pump before cranking.  It sets the choke and dumps in a little gas
from the accelerator pump to kick things off.  The VWs I've driven are
like this, and my Dad's '79 _at_ldsm_at_bil_at_ was like that.  Before you touched
the key, if you gave the _at_lds one hit in the summer or three in the winter,
it would fire right up.
