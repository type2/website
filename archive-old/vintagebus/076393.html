Subject: Re: [VB] Quirky SW gas heater

----- Original Message -----

&gt; OK, I got the wiring figured out on my 12 V SW gas
&gt; heater. I hooked it all up and it fired and got HOT
&gt; right away. However, as it continued to run, it did
&gt; not cycle correctly and eventually thr air started to
&gt; blow cool. Turn it off for 15 minutes, restart it, and
&gt; sam thing, gets HOT then peters out to blowing cool
&gt; air.
&gt; Any Ideas what my problem may be?

I wonder if the microswitch on the temp setting is working. On the body of
the burner itself is an overheat switch that will shut it off if the burner
itself get's too warm. The heater should cycle on and off during normal use.
Put a thermometer on the fan outlet. The air coming out should not get
hotter than 200 degrees before the burner shuts off to cool down a bit
before firing back up again, and the cycle repeats.

If the air is getting hotter than 200, that means the temperature switch is
not working, or the heater is not wired so that when that switch opens
(fully warm, depending on the temperature selected), the power to the coil
and fuel supply should both turn off. If only the coil power is
discontinued, the burner will still keep firing, because the fuel keeps
itself ignited.
