Those sandblasters are great for small jobs.I've had one for years and it's
been a good one.Buy a replacement tip while you're at it.

Subject: [VB] craftsman sandblaster


So I just bought a craftsman compressor at Sears.  It's 6.5 HP and is one of
the black ones they say their professional line as opposed to the red ones.
Anyway, craftsman has a sandblaster that comes as an accessory. Does anyone
have any experience with those?  The price does seem low for a good quality
sandblaster and they don't stock them here in Kingston so I didn't get to
look at it but I'm thinking about buying one in the next couple of weeks as
I hear they'll be on sale but I don't want to buy it if it's crappy.  Does
anyone know if they are crappy?

TIA
