I also like hearing real world stories.  The math is real tricky, and it 
doesn't always seem to be like it calculates to be.  

LIke with Phillips&amp;Katherine's 59 double barndoor panel camper, they have big 
nuts, and 205 75 15s on it, do 3500rpmsat 55mph.
my 61 had big nuts, 205 75 15 tires too, and did 3,000 rpms at 58mph.  When I 
took the tranny out I want to count teeth, it was a 4.37 r&amp;p(35 ring teeth, 8 
pinion teeth) Stock gears.  how did that happen?   math don't work, tell me 
real life.

&lt;&lt; &gt; What's the concensus on running a 1600DP with a freeway flier trans in a
 67
 &gt; bus with redux boxes?  Anyone run this sucessfully?  I'd just like to hear
 &gt; some real world driving stories with this setup.
 
 hi nq,
 
     how does the final drive ratio calculate out? if it's similar to, say, a
 '71 irs bus, there shouldn't be a problem with cooling or driveability... if
 you don't know the redux gearing figures, i wonder if you could to measure
 the wheel revolutions vs. the tranny shaft revolutions to get some
 approximate gear ratios...
