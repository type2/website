I would have agreed with freeing the nut up to this last time I pulled the engine in my 65.
I just got a new motor for it with the captive nut. I was dreading putting that bolt in, but I discovered the perfect body position to be in.
Lay on the ground with your feet sticking out the back, your head up by the shift coupler, reach up with both arms and hug the tranny, you should be able to reach up and hand tighten that bolt without too much interference from the clutch cable or the heater boxes. BTW if you live in a warm place and run J tubes, this bolt is WAY easier to get to.
