&lt;&lt; Please, if anyone has the post with the complete description I would be 
very
 grateful if you would p-mail it to me.
 I deleted mine in error and I will be undertaking that project in the next
 couple of weeks.
 I'll be taking the center section tranny out of a '72 super beetle and
 swapping it into my '66 bus.
 I can't believe I lost those messages....
 I'd sure appreciate the help.
 thanks

=========================

72 super beetle- IRS.   

does it have side covers both sides?  half way through the year they went to 
3.88 and only have one side cover.  If it has one side cover, you will not be 
able to use it.  You can use it as a cose R&amp;P to get a high geared trans 
buildt though.

I think you can swap the side covers from your swing axle trans, but you have 
to keep the ring gear and pinion sets together, just like halves of an engine 
case.  SO if you swap over the bus swing axle side covers to the IRS bug 
trans you have to take the bug ring gear off the IRS and put it on the swing 
side cover so it will stay with the pinion shaft in the trans from the bug.   
I have not done this, and I dont know the dtails if adjustments need doing.   
You probably want to read that section in the bus bentley and then a later 
bentley that shows the IRS stuff, and additionally call and ask a couple 
trans rebuilders.  I'm big on calling people up and asking questions.  They 
probably think I;m a pain, but I get info.


remove engine from bus (if applies)
ditto bug
remove transaxle from bus (drain trans oil first)
ditto bug.
remove axles and tubes from bug trans.    ditto bus

remove side covers (outer ring of 13mm bolts hold them in) from bus trans 
(the one you are going to put in bug)  swap them side to side.  This way you 
will have 4 gears forward and 1 reverse .

put bug axle shafts onto the trans going into bug.  use best crown gears, 
measure play with fulcrums all that stuff (its in your bentley)

install axletube, check slide of tube, use as many paper shims as needed 
(usually 3, can be 1 to 5) .  make sure you install the axle tube on the 
correct sides.  gett to spacing right, then take it apart and seal between 
each shim.  torque only to specified torque (14ft lbs) otherwise you can warp 
things which makes leaks. 

put the bug nose cone and hockey stick on the trans to go in the bug.
new nose cone seal?  new shift rod seals?   dust covers?  axle boots?
okay put tranny in bug, put new gear oil in, put motor in.
