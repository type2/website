My 61 double cab is mostly the body color underneath where it isn't
chipped/surface rusty/never painted(?).  By the way, the last line of the M-
code plate is &quot;UN  265  GREY  730003&quot;.  I know the 730003 is the searial
number and  the UN is the destination code, and I assume the 265 GREY is the
color.  Can someone tell me what the &quot;name&quot; of that color is and if there is a
paint mixing number for it?  It is a grey color but has a sort of greenish
tint to it.  I have seen several double cabs in that color and have heard of
several greys that apply to buses, but don't know which one I have.

TIA,

Jon
