Anyway, a question.  I'm about to RECO my first set of

big nut reduction boxes (done a few early RGBs) and I 

noticed that the N207E roller bearing is the first to tackle.

I hadn't really thought about this ....... the puller

I made for the 6206 ball bearing on the early boxes (like

flat sided balls that you stick in and rotate to

grab the inner race) doesn't look like it's going to fit

in the N207E because of the cage...in fact I can't really

see how any 'inner' puller could fit in there?  Do you sacrifice

the bearing and trash the cage in order to get it out?  

  --  -- - -
do you mean the lower outer bearing?   

if so, I have heated them up slightly with a torch to remove.   But then 
again, if it is notbroken, and you are not planning on replacing it, leave it 
on the stub axle. Wrag a rag around it and duct tape it for protection while 
it is bare.  (Man, your ball bearings are uncovered!)   
after removing the RGBox cover, remove the circlip holding the upper outer 
bearing on, remove that bearing and the upper gear, and remove the axle tube 
from the trans.

easy to tap out the upper inner beairng from the tube with a pole. 

remove the lower plug, undo the 40 (41?)mm nut holding the stub axle on.  If 
you have a compressor and impact this is easy.     I used a drill to undo the 
knocked in bit that was tapped to seal it into the dimple into stub axle.  
but yo probably dont have to.  Then undo the nut.   undo the large circlip 
(like the one holding the crown gear into the center section) and tap the 
stub axle out (not onto your foot please)  then remove the inner lower 
bearing from the box or the stub axle as the case may be.  Be aware that 
although the bentley says do not reuse the inner stub axle nts, they are not 
longer easily available AFAIK, and when I asked several reputable tranny 
rebuilders what they did, they all said they reused them with locktite.   If 
you tape them with a label of which side they came off, you can install them 
on the other stb axle, which will like give a new plac eto bend the tab over 
into the dimple thugh.  So, the idea is not to lose these nuts. 

if you have the 6306 or 6305 bearing with the plastic cover over the ball 
bearings on one side, you canpop off the plastic from the othe side and 
inspect for pits or imperfections.
