Subject: Re: [T2] Heat riser repair

&gt; On the 1600 DP engine in the 66 the heat riser has a hole in it, right
&gt; at the bend. I have tried many different &quot;high heat&quot; exhaust repairs,
&gt; but as of yet, nothing has worked for more than 3 days. Has anyone
&gt; else been able to repair this piece? I found plenty of articles in the
&gt; archives about cleaning out a blocked tube, but didn't stumble across
&gt; any repair questions.

Jason
Ive got a few DP manifolds laying about.
Give me your address and Ill send you an unholy one.
