&lt;&lt; And use your psychokinetic super powers to manipulate it in the blind area
 between the belly pans and the floor?
  But seriously, how in the heck can you fish it thru totally blind?  &gt;&gt;
Hi Thom,
We removed some of the rubber drain plugs out of the belly pans for peekview 
access in strategic areas.  Then had one person working the coat hanger and 
the other who would peek in through the drain hole/s to give up/down, 
left/right, directions to get through the tricky center cross member.  Also 
had a non-belly pan bus nearby to referance the location of empty holes for 
the missing tubing/cable.    Eric&amp;Barb
