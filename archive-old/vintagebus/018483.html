Subject: New Rooftop tent source!!!!

I nabbed a '84 FJ60 Land Cruiser for cheaps today.
Kind of a beater but gets me into a do-able
familymobile commuter with A/C and fourdoors. 

While surfing for the sources for sure to be needed
parts I discovered a source for some pretty cool
looking rooftop tents which were previously unknown to
me. Check them out at:

Let me know what you think. I didn't look at the
pricing  and hate to guess. It won't be on my list for
a long time. I did spy one set up that has the rooftop
tent with attached awning/tent and a folding ladder
going up to the rack from the ground. Might be a
bitchen option for someone with a hardtop camper or a
std/kombi of whatever vintage. (Splittie/FatChick-Bay/Vanagon)
