I just got my '62 bus roadworthy again yesterday, in time for the 90+ degree
heet of southern Indiana !   I've had it for about 2 years now and in general 
it's always run very well.   But occasionally it just refuses to idle.   As 
soon as I take my foot of the gas, it stalls.

This morning was a perfect example.   It started up and idled fine.   As I
drove out of town (about 2 miles), it idled fine at both stop signs.   Then
came the 10 mile stretch of 55mph highway.   After that, it died as soon as
I took my foot off the gas.   It proceeded to stall at every stop for the 
next 5 miles of the trip.   But when I pulled into the lot at work, it was
back to idling fine.

Any ideas ?   I *just* did a tune-up (new plugs, new points, set the timing,
adjusted the valves, etc).   

I should mention my '62 has a 1600 DP out of a '73 bug with a Bosch 009 
distributor.

Thanks !

- Matt
