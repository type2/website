in my 62 panel i reused the original horse hair pads (it had sat for 20
years), the reason for this was due to the hump in the backrest (62 only?)
and the inability of anyone i contacted to redo this hump. Boy do i regret
this now, i feel like i'm sitting on the springs, the hump has all but gone
away and every time i lift the seat out i have a mess, so! go with the new,
Wolfsburg West makes and sells these and i also sell their product.

ps; they did last the first couple thousand miles before going south on me.

Subject: [VB] Horsehair Pads - Preserve or Pitch?


Here are the stats and conditon:

1959 Westfalia SO23
Parked in 1976, and sat until 1998-99, rescued and sitting again during
restoration

So, the bus was used for 17 years and has sat for 24 years.  I diassembled
the rear cushions so that the seamstress could make patterns from the old
cushion covers in order to make the new cushion covers.  The horsehair pads
LOOK almost new, no indentations from big, wide butts sitting on them, and
very little hair silt from crumbling/decay.  All in all they're still very
intact.  So what's the problem?

Well, I hate to go to all of the work of preserving the horsehair pads and
stapling on the new cushion covers if the darn things are just going to
crumble away after using them a month or two.  The pads might look good, but
I'm afraid they're so brittle from age that any significant use will destroy
them.  I'm sure they'd look good forever if never used, but I plan on using
this camper after the initial honeymoon/show tour/paranoia months pass.

Any suggestions out there?  Keep the original horsehair in and my fingers
crossed, or rebuild them out of new material for comfort and durability?

TIA.

Robert
