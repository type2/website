&gt; Do you guys know any good sites with info on how to use a paint gun; I have
&gt; done a little searching without any luck.


Kevin,

http://www.autobodystore_dot_com is one of the best most objective autobody
related sites I've ever found.   The bulletin board is really good and
stocked with professionals that will give you an answer to ANY question
you could think of.  I sure there are other sites, but I like this one.
