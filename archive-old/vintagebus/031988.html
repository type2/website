The way I clean the leatherette sounds as kinky as the title of the post.
First your gonna need, a stiff brush, a spray bottle, water, dishwater liquid
(I use Sunlight), a wet/dry vac, and a duck.
   Mix some water with some Sunlight in the spray bottle,  spray you seat and
rub gently with the brush in all sorts of directions.  Vac up the brown gunky
water.  The reason for the vac is so that this doesn't soak into the backing
of the leatherette.  It tends to stretch it and even sometimes lifting ot the
little squares can happen.  
     Peace, Love, and oh, and for the duck--I just like a little company when
I'm working,
           Mr. Bubble Head
