I dont think your neighbor dives his bus enough s mice are making nests in 
there!!!!!


........
Last night a neighbor dropped by with a generator problem,, His brush

springs popped out!

He's driving a dormobile.

When I leaned in to get a good look,, I was surprized to feel the heat,

after some questions, and snooping, I notices some FUZZ sticking out the

spark plug hole in the tin,,

yeeeks!   The Darn mice had made a nest in the shroud on top of the

cylinders!!

By this time, there was no more sense in describing how to replace a

generator with out pulling the shroud off!


I sent him home with a new brush holder assembly, and a bit more work than

he expected!
