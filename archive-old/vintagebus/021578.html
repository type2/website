Fan Mail

Here it is again.  That curious time of year when
otherwise normal folk wrinkle their brow and gaze
ponderously into space in a vain effort to recall the
names of eight mythical caribo.  Donner or Donder?  (I
once won a buck on that one.)  (And no... Sleepy and
Doc are from a different myth :-)

There are more Christmas cards than usual this year,
some with CD covers to sign.  Thank you all.  You are
very kind.

And fan mail too, of a sort... &quot;If imitation is the
sincerest form of flattery, you should send DB&amp;HVW a
note of thanks,&quot;  ...with a big smiley there on the
end... and a xerox of a page from the December
(January?) issue of DB&amp;HVW.  No page number.  The
copier has caused the print to sorta wind off the
right-hand edge.  But you can read it okay.  

It's titled 'Semaphore', subtitled 'Careful Assembly
and Break-in Techniques Can Be the Key to Long Engine
Life.'  It's written by Mr. Dean Kirsten, the Editor of
'Dune Buggies and Hot VWs' magazine.

The article (or rather, the editorial) does in fact say
what I've been preaching for twenty years and more,
including five years of saying it over the Internet. 
But I don't believe it justifies a note of thanks
because Mr. Kirsten isn't imitating me.  What Dean is
saying is exactly what the VW workshop manual has been
saying for the last forty years or thereabouts.  Still,
I'm glad to hear him say it.  It's a message worth
repeating, which is what I've been doing.  

If anyone was imitating anything it was me, waving the
factory specs in your face, pretending I knew what I
was talking about :-)

I've urged you to build your own engines saying it
would be hard to do worse than a factory-built job. 
I've talked about 'Free Horsepower' and how to corral
the several wild horses running loose in your valve
train.  And generally caught hell for doing so, too :-) 
Several have said it couldn't be true, otherwise they would
have seen it in the magazines.

Now they have.  Seen it, that is.  So I guess it's 'officially' true.  
Free horsepower.  Come an' get it!

Of course, nothing is truly free. You gotta pay for
those free horses.  But the coinage is time.  When you
set out to build just one engine, you have time on your
side.  You can afford to spend however much time it
takes to get it right.  

That's what Mr. Kirsten has done.  He has expended the
time it takes to properly assemble an engine.  I've a
hunch he will find it earns him a handsome dividend.

PS -- It's Donder in the poem (Clement Moore's 'A Visit
From St. Nicolas').  Which is probably wrong.  'Donner'
makes more sense.  'Donner' means 'thunder' in Chermann.
  (I don't know what 'Donder' is.)  The other members 
of the crew are Comet, Cupid, Blitzen (ie 'Flash'), Dasher, 
Dancer, Prancer and Vixen.

As to the other myth... Grumpy, Sneezy, Sleepy, Dopey
and Bashful.

(If you're wondering why anyone should clutter their
mind with such stuff, the answer is a bit fey.  It has
to do with being an ex-Senior Chief Petty Officer in
the United States Navy, at one time a member of the
Mess. On occasions when we would host senior NCO's from
other Services or nations, glasses were liable to be
raised in celebration.  When that happens the Mess
President is liable to look at you (or any other member
of the Mess) and say &quot;Senior Chief... a toast to our
guests, if you please.&quot;  Drunk or sober, you're
expected to respond with a 'traditional' toast.  (Or
song!)  

The eight tiny raindeer are toasted as the first
aircrew, the Seven Dwarfs as the first Seabees (or
Engineers) and... so forth. (Frogmen, submariners,
British Marines... there is a 'traditional' toast in
each case... even a few polite ones.) )

-- a happy Christmas to all.  -- rsh
