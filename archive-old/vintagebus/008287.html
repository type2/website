&gt;The 60 Double door I had was logo'd at one point and it was exterior only.
&gt;There is a really cool red Double door that cruises to the Vintage meet in
&gt;Seattle every year and it has a Meat Packing  logo on the sides. It is
&gt;really cool. It is exterior only as well.
&gt;
I've heard stories there's a Whiskey-logo'd Panel around somewhere north of
Phoenix, I've never seen it, that would be pretty neat.
