Subject: 1800 Dyno with duel 34 solex

   Last night we dynoed another 1800 (74X88cut ins) using the new CB Solex
34 pdsit duel carb set up to see what it does and to compare to a like
engine dynoed with Kaduds, here are the results



rpm                                     torque  in ft lbs
hp
2500 rpm                             100.83
48
3000 rpm                             100.83
57.6	
3500 rpm                              96.63
64.4
4000 rpm                              91.38
69.6
4500 rpm                              82.98
71.1
5000 rpm                              76.67
73

Remember that hp and torque change with RPM's and that when they state a
stock 1600 at 52 hp that is at the high range of rpm's, thus NOT 52 hp all
the time!  Most people never rev their 1600's up to the rpm's to achive max
hp.

This engine was dynoed under less then perfect temps and humidity
the corrected hp at 5000 rpm's 88 hp
the corrected torgue at 3000 rpm is 111.64 ft lbs torque

   One of the problems we had was the owners choice of exhaust, it COST hp
and torque, but he needs it (the muffler) to clear his trailer hitch.

   The carbs came stock with 20 mm venturis, 115 air correction, 130 mains
and 50 pilot/idle jets

  Our final set up was 28 degrees total advance (made 2 more hp and more
when retarded from 30 degrees total), replaced the venturis with 28 mm, 130
air correction, 145 main and 55 pilot/idle jets. Tweeked the accelerator
pumps for faster throttle response.
  Compared to the same engine with Kaduds and a Thunderbird header we feel
these carbs do the same thing. With the restrictive exhaust we lost a lot
and felt the numbers would have been around the same or BETTER. The last
1800 was dynoed under near perfect weather conditions.

   This engine is going in a split bus pulling a trailer, no problem with
power and life span.

  On a side note, want to drop a load, watch the dyno guy rev the engine to
5500 rpm's then put a load on it and hold it there for a couple minutes, all
you can think of is a bomb ready to explode. But it made it through all the
abuse we fed it with flying colors, now it's ready to drop in and go!
