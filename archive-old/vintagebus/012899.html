&gt; A gold star to wear on your forehead for the first one to get the
right
&gt; answer to this one.
&gt; '57  36 horse motor.  Bone stock.  VJR4BR dizzy.  105-110 PSI
compression.
&gt; Tune up spec's are right on.  Stock exhaust, 28 PCI carb and hand
choke.
&gt; 6V system.
&gt; New plug wires (Bosch), dizzy cap, rotor.
&gt; Plugs aren't too old and just cleaned and re-gapped.
&gt; #1 cylinder isn't firing, 2 thru 4 are.
&gt; Lift the high tension lead out of the dizzy tower for #1, about 1/4&quot;
above
&gt; it, and then the sparks jump from the lead down into the dizzy tower
&gt; opening for #1 and the cylinder picks up and the motor purrs.
&gt; Changed wires for #1 and same as above.
&gt; Changed rotor...same
&gt; changed dizzy cap....same
&gt; It's only doing it on #1.  Push the high tension lead firmly into
the cap
&gt; and the cylinder dies.  Pull the lead out so there's a bit of air
space
&gt; between it and the cap tower and the sparks jump the air gap and the
&gt; cylinder fires.
&gt; I've been on this list for awhile.  Haven't asked a whole lot of
questions
&gt; cuz I've been able to figure it all out.  So far anyways.
&gt; I'm hoping that there is another out there that has had a problem like
&gt; this and has already figured it out.
&gt; I haven't looked the #1 plug over completely...scrutinized it so to
speak
&gt; but I will be putting in new plugs tonight just to rule that part of
the
&gt; puzzle out.

I'll bet that the new plugs cure the problem.  The fact that the
cylinder fires when there is an air gap at the distributor (and
corresponding higher voltage) indicates a wire or plug problem.  Since
the wire has been replaced, the plug is suspect.
