The back bench attaches to the sidewalls via an L shaped bracket.  It bolts 
to the back of the bench and to the sidewalls.  My bus is missing these 
brackets as well and I only discovered what they were through a recent isssue 
of VW trends.  It is the one with the Yellow 21 Window deluxe on the cover 
(not the year of the bus issue).  In the 21 window pictorial they show off 
the custom wood interior and in one of the shots you can see the piece that 
holds the bench in place.  I believe the shot (I lost my copy) shows custom 
wooden brackets but I have seen the regular ones before.  My bus is missing 
these pieces as well so the bench falls down if you lean on it too hard.  I 
guess these are hard to find parts but a custom part shouldn't be hard to 
make.  The sidewalls of your bus should already have the holes for the bolts 
so it's just a matter of finding a bolt that fits and attaching it to 
something that is strong enough to hold the bench in place.  Good Luck!
