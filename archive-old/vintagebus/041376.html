I go with this.  There may be some better stuff, but it works for the life
of the engine.  That's good enough for me.  If you have problems sealing
your case with these, you have other problems to deal with other than the
sealant.

Ok I fell for it.
Say what you will, but RTV is great stuff used in the right places.  Not
many places to use it on a VW engine, but lots on transaxles.
I don't understand why people are so against RTV.  Just because it gets
used in the wrong places, doesn't mean it's not good stuff.
