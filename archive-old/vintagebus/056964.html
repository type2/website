Subject: Re: [VB] can't figure out red light glow

It might just be because of voltage drop in the wiring.  If it goes away
wnen you turn the headlights off, don't worry about it.  My generator
light glowed dimly at night with the lights on.  After replacing the
generator with an alternator (for another reason), it still glows.

&gt; Hi Alex,
&gt; Check you generator brushes to make sure they are taller than the cages they
&gt; sit in.  Is the commutator of the generator dirty?  If so clean it with a
&gt; cardboard emery finger nail sanding stick when the engine is running.  Clean
&gt; and retighten all connections between the generator, regulator (regulators
&gt; that are seperate from the generator need good contact to the body!), starter
&gt; solinoid, battery, and all the wiring going up front through the fuse box,
&gt; headlight switch, ignition switch and back to the starter solinoid, and coil.
&gt;  Then take your multimeter and with it set for voltmeter check the voltage at
&gt; the battery terminals and then check at various points of the above wiring
&gt; system and see how much drop in voltage there is and if you can solve it.
