After 28 years of VW ownership, { 61 ragtop, 63 convertible, 67 bug, 69
bug }I have finally purchased a bus. Don't know what took me so long.
But in those years, I've never had a problem with vent wings. 
-------

congratulation and welcome to the cult!!! :0    You should probably go get a 
copy of the Betley reprint of teh Trans porter workshop manual 1963 edition.  
It was written for working on 63 through 67 type2s, and is very helpful on 
all sorts of stuff including how the vents wings are assembled/dissembled.

........
Untill
now. My recent aquisition, a 67 model 221 has a broken latch on the
passenger's side and a broken lower post on the driver's side vent
wings. I have heard that the glass to frame seal is difficult to
replace.

--------
ya- is common fo rthe latche sto be broken.  I think some people don't 
realise you have to push the little button in to turn the latch???   Yes the 
glass to frame seal can be a PITA, but it isn't that bad really.    It would 
probably be easier to get a replacement vent wing frame than repair the 
broken one you have.

 Does'nt look that hard to me with the proper tools and a little
common sense for pressing the glass into the frame, However, the broken
lower post, with the spring tensioner, is another matter. Is it as
simple as welding another threaded rod to the frame? Any suggestions on
either problem would be appreciated.
Thanks,
John
