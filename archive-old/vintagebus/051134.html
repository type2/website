Subject: steering &amp; suspension

Hey all,
I know I shouldn't put two subjects in one post, but really one item is just
a comment.

I have had a steering problem ever since I bought my 67 SC last August.
Originally I thought it was the steering box because of all the previous
posts I had read. I started researching buying a new or rebuilt steering box
assembly. Then someone mentioned tie rod ends, so I figured maybe that was
it and purchased all 4 tie rid ends and a removal tool. That turned out not
to be the case either, it was the drag link with a mile of play. I ordered
one from Bus Depot, which got to me fast, and it was only and hour to put
in. Wow, steering back ! It was only from the volumous amounts of raw
experience from the list that I was able to get brave enough to actually do
the job.

The second item is front suspension. I know my torsion bars are either
broke, out of alignment or in some other way not right. My front end sits
nearly down to the stops which have no rubber left on that side. each and
every little bump bangs my front end. The swing arms look to be stock, but
how can one tell? everything down there seems to be equally greasy, but
since I bought this truck in a lowered condition and was able to properly
raise the rear, I am perplexed as to what to do with the front. Right now I
am running 750lb coil over shocks that I put on yesterday that raises it
back to stock height, but it also rides like a, well, truck. What to do with
my daily driver to see what's wrong with the suspension?
