Subject: Re: [VB] 70 westy stuff into a 61?

The bay bus in not as wide as a split but longer.
When you put a full width rear bay seat in a split, you have an extra inch gap
on each end.
You will need to shorten the side cab o make it fit.

&gt; Hi all, I found a 70 westy being parted out in the Dallas area today. I
&gt; bought the z-bed for $40, now I'm kinda half-way thinking about maybe
&gt; getting the tall side closet that goes next to it and the overhead
&gt; cabinet that goes over the very back top area. Can someone please tell me
&gt; if these would fit into a 61 kombi ? The z-bed looks like it'll go in
&gt; with no problems, but do the closet and overhead cabinet fit or would
&gt; they need modified?
