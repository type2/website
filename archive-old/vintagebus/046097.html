&lt;&lt; What is an impact driver and where can I find one?&gt;&gt;
Hi Joy,
It is a devise you both hammer and twist at the same time to loosen the 
screws.  Being right handed I hold the impact driver with my left hand and 
press it hard into the screw and turn it in the direction I want it to go at 
the same time.  Then with my right hand I hit the end of the impact driver 
with a hammer.  This should only be used to loosen the screw about a turn or 
so only or risk destroying the nut plate!

&lt;&lt;And how do I keep from losing that backing plate?&gt;&gt;
Once you have the screws loosened about a turn you should most likely have 
won the war with them.  But if they are still hard to move alot of turning 
them then just turn them back in and out several times while spraying 
penetrating oil into thier threads.  This will hopefully work in the oil into 
the treads of the nut plate.

&lt;&lt;A friend told me it would not be cool if that backing plate fell off.....&gt;&gt;
Definitely not fun.

&lt;&lt;How do I know when I need to stop trying with the screwdriver?&gt;&gt;
Once you either have the screws out or the heads of the screws worn so badly 
that they will not come out.  Remember to push with your whole body wieght as 
hard as possible on the screwdriver handle toward the tip to keep the tip of 
the screwdriver in the head of the screw while turning a hard to move screw.

&lt;&lt;And when you guys speak of drilling it out, are you referring to a process 
like using an &quot;easy out&quot;? &gt;&gt;
NO!  Drilling out means using a set of drills starting out with a 1/8&quot; cobalt 
drill as a starting hole then increase the drilling sizes until you are one 
drill size below the drill size for that particular drill size for the tap of 
those threads.  If you got the centerng of the hole perfect you can then 
drill with the tap drill size.  If off a little the threads will show up on 
one side of the hole.  Too much off center and you will have to use a hammer 
and punch to fold the cresent shaped piece of fastener up and out of the 
hole.  Just a tiny bit off and you can carefully tap out the remains of the 
fastener taking out the tap often to clean out the remains with a magnet and 
nail.  Make sure to only use HSS taps and drill bits!
NEVER use a easy out on threaded fasteners that are stuck in place!  You will 
break them off in the part and not be able to drill them out due to thier 
hardness!
