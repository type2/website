It can be done, and quickly and easily with the flat 17/19mm ratcheting
box wrench from Sears ($12 last time I looked). If you glue your left
upper bolt in, it's waiting patiently for you every time. YOu just thread
your nut on by hand, get in there blind with the 17mm end of the tool, and
hook it on and tighten/loosen.  See my post from several weeks ago for
details. I glued both bolts in decades ago; engine I/O's take me 15
minutes with the doghouse, not counting the bumper and wiring.

The bolts knock out with small force when you have to remove your tranny
or starter, then glue them back in. My bus religion says that you only go
under the bus to get the lower 2 nuts and heater connections when doing an
engine pull. Everything else, including the fuel line is done from the
rear, outside. See my fuel line mod page for details, at:

Good luck, and happy bussing!
