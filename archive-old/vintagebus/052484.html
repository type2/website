Subject: Re: [VB] removing inner  front wheel bearing

Hey Michel

Front bearings - for me those were a nightmare.  As I recall, I destroyed
them and removed them in pieces, but that was OK because I would never have
risked using them again anyway.

Thanks for the info about ordering from Europe.  I too need to replace my
front wheel cylinders.

&gt; Wow
&gt;
&gt; in the restoration process of my microbus 1960, i dropped the axle beam on
&gt; floor, and removed all  brake part (then the surprise, all wheel cylinder
&gt; are stuck in rust), now to remove the inner wheel bearing its a hard think
&gt; it barely move, i dont have a puller with me, is there any trick to remove
&gt; this, in order to get my backplate to be blasted/por-15 ??
&gt;
&gt; Also, i was looking around for brake wheel cylinder part, i wonder why its
&gt; less expensive to buy in Europe from Custom speed part
&gt; (http://www.customspeedparts_dot_com/) than any other store in US/Canada ??
&gt; Its 25 Euro vs 39$ US each cylinder and the shipping is almost the same
from
&gt; US or from Europe (to Canada).
&gt;
&gt; Did you know you could buy a new axle beam for about 500 $ shipped there ?
