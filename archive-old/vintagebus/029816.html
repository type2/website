Subject: On the Road

Well my newest acquisition 56DD made it's maiden voyage today rather all
of a sudden and reluctantly and did surprisingly well for a bus that has
not seen the road or a DMV sticker for nearly 25 years. 

I had planned on taking time getting it roadworthy and hadn't registered
it yet but yesterday my daily driver took a turn for the worst and the
distributor failed. Being a 911 it's not like I can just run out and by
a part and get it on the road easily, so I dropped it off at my
partner's house on a trailer another friend had and came back to my
house with the 56 DD on it. I then spent the rest of Sunday making sure
it would drive well. The tires are the original bias-ply and in need of
a new set but that will come tomorrow. They actually are not bad but do
need to be replaced. The third brake light is iffy and comes on usually.
The lights finally work well after cleaning them again late last night.
We had actually got everything working well a few weeks prior but as you
all know these problems have a tendancy of coming back.

So this morning I got on the 110 in Pasadena and drove it to west Los
Angeles to deal with getting my car to the shop. About 30 miles tops and
brought up the speed to 65 mph (stock original 36 horse on flat surface)
and it drove real smooth. The brakes feel great thanks to my partner.
After that I drove it down to Carson (another 30 to 40 mile round trip)
to get it weighed. Which by the way came out to be 2480 Lbs minus a 36
horse engine in the cargo area and a couple of pressbumpers and some
other junk. Anyone know what a 36 horse engine weighs? I seem to recall
a thread about weight and without all the junk in the cargo area I'd
take a guess at around 2200 lbs. Then on to a two hour stint to get new
plates at the DMV so it is fully roadworthy (well almost,  I still have
to get the blinkers going strong)

Anyway now I have to drive it back home at night but luckily the freeway
won't be too bad and the lights work good so I should be fine. Hey it's
got it's rattles and noises and shakes but it also has a lot of
character and deserves to be on the road so I quess I can live with all
the quirks and someday it will all be worked into a fine and pround
machine again. Can't wait. Will post pics soon. Not enough time in the day.

By the way I have to say this is my favorite site, hey I'm partial. And
if you're wondering when are they going to do something more... soon, soon.
Later for now. Just wait for my next project.
