Even though it isn't a VW engine, it's still an aircooled flat 4 engine.
The price was too good to pass up so I bought it (really shouldn't have)
just to have for future use.   It's a 32 cubic inch military engine - 4
cylinder overhead valve, fuel pump, air filter (with changer indicator) spin
on oil filter, protected and waterproofed spark plug wires, and magneto for
power.  You can buy a 24v starter for them but it comes with a pulley to
rope start it if need be.  These are military surplus engine that the
government paid $2400 for originally.  I paid $380 and some dollars shipped
to my door.  That's cheap for a brand new 15 to 20 hp engine.  It's made by
some Teledyne corporation but parts can still be had for these engines from
www.saturnsurplus_dot_com

The exhaust on this thing looks very early beetle-ish.  Anyway, paperwork is
included, it's brand new and never been run.  Mine was produced in March of
1990.  I put it back in the box and stored it in the garage.  I could tell
you where to find pictures of it on the net but I would be in violation (I
think) of the new rules on the vintagebus listserv.  If you would like to
know where to find pictures of this engine and maybe even buy one for
yourself (make great kart engines, portable welder machines, generator or
pump runners) - get in touch with me and I'll send you a couple of URLs.
