A reserve price isn't necessarily secret.  Some sellers want it secret,
some don't.  There are reasons that a seller would prefer it one way or the
other.

In my case, I'd like to use the ebay community to establish a valuation.
If I were to put the reserve price up there, it would &quot;taint&quot; the results.
Some sellers reveal the reserve to separate the men from the boys up front.

I'm working on buying a house, and need to free up some cash.  I'll have
some more goodies up in the next few days.
