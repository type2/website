Subject: Got Flywheel off...

Well I got the flywheel off...I took a big pair of plyers and clamped
them around the hub of the flywheel...The arm of the tranny that goes
into the flywheel looks pretty straight so I am hoping the tranny is
still usable....But there is alot of metal  shavings  floating  in the
area the flywheel was in....now on the back of the flywheel, the side
facing the tranny, there is a plate bolted onto it. There are three nuts
holding three of the bolts in place and it looks like they have been
rubbing against the tranny case...Is this due to improper shimming of 
the flywheel?....Well gonna start tearing down the motor today...Will be
my first time doing this so wish me luck....For all those who have
replied to my previous emails thanks....

Greg
