Well, all of this leads me to change this thread a bit and ask another
question.  Thom's point of the cost of a Type specific glossy mag, with very
limited advetisers costing subscribers quite a bit doesn't sound real
appealing.  .    I'm already a Neato member and an SV2 member (San Diego), and
get really stoked when the news letters come in.  But what other clubs out there
are producing news letters?  If anything it is worth it for the classifieds.
Obviously SOTO is a bust, so what other clubs out there are actually producing a
newsletter.  ABC, Box on wheels??? Who?

I've seen the advertisement in Neato for one called Splitezine.  Anybody
subscribe to this one or is it a bust also?

Aaron
