Subject: rewirign and Fuse blocks (NOS, good used, repro'd)
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I've searched the archives for the past hour and havent really come up with 
much.

We'll be having our bus rewired soon and along with that, we need a new fuse 
block.  I'll probably be getting the harness from Wiring Works.  Bob makes 
them all, he's close and might be cheapest.  I havent asked yet, but I'm 
assuming a replacement fuse block isnt included.

The bus in question is originally a 65 Microbus (221)  Is a standard harness 
all we need?  I've searched most of the major online catalogs and only the 
Bus Depot lists both a harness and a loom.  Both are the same price ($239 
each) but have different part #'s.  The harness has part $ 213 1965.  the 
loom has part # WK213 1965.  Looks pretty close to me.  These are the same 
things right?

Are these harnesses from Wiring Works totally complete?  Are the dome lights 
included?

In regards to the fuse blocks, I remember a post a while back saying that 
some (all?) of the repro'd ones were set up backwards.  Is this the case.  
They might work, but I really dont want a backwards one.  

Does anyone have a NOS or known good one they'd be willing to part with?  We 
need the later 8 fuse block.

Any help appreciated
