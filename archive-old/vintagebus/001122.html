&gt;Next, I want to add the cover plate to the oil pump that allows a
&gt;remote oil filter/cooler. I'll mount a filter next to the left wheel
&gt;well. In the oil filter line I can add a second cooler.

First, just a pump cover won't make it go to the filter. You must have the
pump with the rerouted plumbing to send to and receive from the filter. If
adding a cooler to this line just remember it is before the relief valve and
so the pressures on a cold morning can be astronomical. The cheesy tube and
fin jobs are a real likely candidate to make your own special James Bond oil
slick/smoke screen device. Use copper tubing or high pressure hose
assemblies to make it up. Hose clamps and heater hose ain't gonna cut it.
