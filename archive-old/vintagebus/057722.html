Subject: Re: [VB] starter woes...

I recently re-read the instructions that came with my new starter that 
said the solenoid now needed a minimum of 9 volts to engage.  I was 
losing at least a few volts from a bad ground connection.  Renewing that 
connection- sanding down to the paint on the ground connection from the 
battery to the body- got me back my starting.

&gt;I think you are not getting enough juice to squeeze through that 20'
&gt;run of aged wiring to overcome the aged gumminess of the starter
&gt;armature. Either cleaning the starter (uh, inside too) and relubing or
&gt;fixing the wiring should help, the long-term fix would probably be
&gt;doing both. Whupping the starter with a wrench is a traditional
&gt;treatment for all sorts of starter woes, sometimes it even works a
&gt;couple of times...

&gt;Ok my starter starts when it wants to and my hand and screwdriver do
&gt;the
&gt;starting when it doesnt.  Why is it that when I turn the key the
&gt;starter
&gt;clicks, but when I crawl under the bus and cross the two wires it
&gt;comes right
&gt;to life???  The little things that keep me and my 59 closer than I
&gt;want to be
&gt;sometimes....
