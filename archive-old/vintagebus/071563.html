&gt;
&gt; part # 211-129-611B; and as you see, at least one photo
has been
&gt; tagged &quot;HDfilter,&quot; which is what the part number calls out
to in the
&gt; 58 - 67  parts manual.
&gt;
&gt; so either 611Bs are NOT cyclones,

Yes, those are not cyclones. That is the stock VW oil bath
air filter for dusty climates.

I have them on all my South African and Brazilian buses.
They came as standard on the Brazilian Fleetlines. The
mounting bracket was welded into the engine compartment.

On German-built buses the mounting bracket was as shown in
craig's pic, bolted in. As far as I can work out, this was
either a service fitment, or it was available from the
factory under M-code 007. Take note all you M-code
collectors -- I haven't seen that one deciphered before on
any of the lists I've seen.

Last week I sold my 67 ambulance, with M-code 007 and the
same air filter set-up. I also sold my 61 westy to the same
person. Both buses needed full resto.
