Hey y'all
I haven;t been real active on the lists lately, lots happening chez Burrito. 
  Kids getting outta school, Full Moon Bus Club campouts, and diagnostics.
Recent work on the Express is simple valve adjustment, remove the BN4 heater 
(still available p-mail if interested), and finding a Dormobile vent cover 
(Thanks Sue Dolvin!)
The Burrito Express has been performing daily driver duties, as well as some 
camping and 'cruising'.
Kids getting outta school rocks, because I get outta work early enough we 
can go swimming and such in the afternoons.  I pay the price with early to 
rise syndrome.  That's ok though, the kids and dogs don't care.
You probably already read a trip report on May Be Busses (and some 
grumblings due to last minute relocation).  Sorry folks, Myrtle Beach wasn't 
the happening place unless you wanted to listen to unmuffled Harleys and 
drunk folks all night long in a packed campground.  If that's what you're 
into, I recommend Huntington Beach State Park the weekend before Memorial 
day.  Good luck finding a site.  We ended up at Santee State Park, a good 
central location for about all of South Carolina and handy to folks North 
and South of us as well, it's right off I95.  The west might take a bit more 
time...
Diagnostics - As you may recall, the Express has been running warmer than I 
care to see.  Can hardly hold the dipstick after a medium to long run.  I 
like being able to hold my


dipstick (what WERE you thinking?).

Fred Stoermer said do the plug test.  DOH!  I did it Fred, the electrodes 
are a light tan/grey.  There's a deposit of carbon around the 'outside' of 
the plug, you were right on Fred.  One of the local Weber experts was 
happily selling me jets, but as we talked, suggested that Sherry had built a 
wonderful engine, though the compression ratio is quite suitable for a 
supercharged or turbocharged engine, but for normal aspiration the 
compression is too low (6.8:1).  The result is inefficient combustion, with 
the attendent heat production as a result.
This weekend is engine pull, remove 0.030 shims, and bump the compression to 
about 7.8:1.  I'm also roughing in the Styrofoam templates for the remote 
oil cooler duct system, prelocate the system, and remove the remaining 
Eberspacher ductwork and tinware.
Oh yeah, my friend Mike, the guy that tried to ride his BMW through a bus 
fulla tourista might be coming down this weekend to visit.  He doesn't have 
full use of his arms and other parts, so he'll be a high maintenence guest 
looking on...  Maybe he can hand wrenches and stuff.  The puppy doesn't 
fetch the correct size every time yet, the kids get bored and the wife gets 
offended by all the cussing...

It's Burrito time so I'll post later with results.

Later taters
Dave
&quot;The question is, said Alice, whether words can mean so many things&quot;
