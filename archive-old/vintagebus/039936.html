  I have what I conider a imberassing question,where do you find the M-codes 
on a bus?The only id plate I find is behind the Passenger seat and it has 
the Vin#s on it.I Would like to know what my 65 deluxe came with.I did look 
at a few other buses today and couldnt find anything differant on them.
