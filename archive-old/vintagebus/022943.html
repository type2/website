Why can't we have something like this in NorCal?  Why must everything be in
SoCal?

There's nothing significant in the Sacramento area.  Sure, there's the
rama, but it's pretty much overrun by the slamed/primer crowd.

We need a *vintage* meet.  No A-chassis.  No drag racing.  Like a Kelly
Park, but closer.
