Hooboy, not this one!

Folks, this is not a nice thing.  The unwitting sender of this message
(bryant) made the mistake of answering &quot;I Accept&quot; to an end user licence
agreement that gave permission for the installed program to send this
message to everybody in his address book.

In essence this is a &quot;legal&quot; virus since it asks permission first!

Since it doesn't come as an attachment, it slips past the list filters.
I will see about fixing this on the filters.

Word to the wise:  Don't go to the friendgreeting site and don't accept
any EULA until you read the whole thing.

Bryant, I don't know how to fix this.  You can probably do a Google search
on &quot;friendgreeting&quot; and get a solution.
