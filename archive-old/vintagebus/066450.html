Subject: RE: [VB] Bus Shifter Differences

66/67 front  shift rods use a bushing in the end that slips ove a pin welded
on the bus. It could work with a LOT of work, no need though, if all your
other shift components are good you should have no problem shifting,
regardless of what year bus you have.

Subject: [VB] Bus Shifter Differences


Can someone please explain the difference between a '60-'65 Bus shifter and
the later '66 and up versions.  Does the earlier version extend further
below
the cab floor?  Might sound silly at first, but what would I need to do to
get
a '66 and up shifter to work on a '60 Bus.

Thanks,
Aaron
