How about an impromptu weekend camping trip to the middle of nowhere!?  

Westy owners from Oregon, Idaho, Northern California, &amp; Northern Nevada
(and anywhere else, for that matter!) load up your vans with gear, food,
and families... let's converge at the little town of Frenchglen, Oregon
(population 10!).  It'll be an unusual, not-everyone's-cup-of-tea kinda
trip, but it should be fun!

No sponsors, no swap meets, no shows, no planned activities, no
schedule... just relax, trade travel stories, see other Westys, meet nice
folks, and hang out in Frenchglen...sip root beer (or any of the
wonderful microbrews on tap at The Buckeroo Room) on the wood porch in
front of the Frenchglen Mercantile...

The Frenchglen, Steen Mountain, Alvord Desert, Malheur National Wildlife
Refuge is one of the most unusual and beautiful places in the west. 
Check it out at:

We can &quot;camp&quot; right on the main street in town at the Frenchglen Wayside
State Park.  It's primitive (a grassy area, one picnic table, and a water
spigot) - but basic provisions are available at the Frenchglen
Mercantile.  WONDERFUL meals are usually available at The Buckeroo Room
and the Frenchglen Hotel (you may need to make reservations well ahead of
time: fghotel_at_ptinet_dot_net).  However, this is a TINY town with limited
facilities - everyone should plan on being self sufficient food-wise
(just in case).  In route complete services &amp; provisions are available at
Burns, Lakeview, or Ontario, Oregon or, if you're coming from Nevada,
stock up in Winnemucca.

For those who don't want to &quot;rough it&quot; - the Frenchglen Hotel:

Also, there is lodging in Burns:

Let me know if you are going (martywallace_at_rocketmail_dot_com) - I'm going to
be coordinating caravans and contacts.

See you there!
