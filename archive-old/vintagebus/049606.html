Subject: Re: Bondo opinion (fact) :)


&gt;I use &quot;RAGE&quot;  costs more but sands and feathers nicely.  I wait for it to
&gt;go on sale and get it for just under $20 a gallon (enough for 3-4 cars for
&gt;me)
&gt;
&gt;That is my opinion.

How would this compare to &quot;All-metal&quot; and similar products? I don't mind a
thin patch now and then, but I dislike bondo for its water-attracting
tendencies. Supposedly, all-metal is less hydrophilic.

I've thought of learning leading techniques (hey, I'm a masochist... on
Sunday was sandblasting in full gear in TEXAS in July !),
but Bob H points out that 1/3&quot; of lead is no better than 1/3&quot; of bondo -
bad body work is bad bodywork!
