&gt; No offense, but I think you're crazy to trust one of those thin
&gt; walled throw
&gt; away helium tanks to 100-110 psi a pressure blaster runs at.  I'd
&gt; want some
&gt; substantial structure in my tank.  BTW, read the warning stamped on
&gt; the
&gt; outside of that party tank.  If I remember correctly, it states
&gt; something
&gt; about re-pressurizing the tank or using it for other purposes.  I'm
&gt; sure its
&gt; mostly for legal liability, but like I said I wouldn't take any
&gt; chances with
&gt; my health.  Its your life though.

I used to use 20 pound freon tanks for air bottles.  These bottles had
a blow-out panel on their bottoms that would fail before the cylinder
in case of overpressurization.  They even sold valve/gauge/hose setups
in auto parts stores specifically for this conversion.  I don't know if
they have these any more, though.

Most disposable tanks tend to be rather susceptable to rust, and I
wouldn't use any tank that shows signs of rust.  Unfortunately, you
cannot see rust inside the tank, so the only way to stay safe is to
replace the tank periodically.
