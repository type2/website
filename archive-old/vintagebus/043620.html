&gt;Do you have a ton of other gizmos in the bus? Like a slammin' stereo, or
&gt;lots of gauges, or extra lights?  I've found that any or all of the above
&gt;can drastically change tach readings, fwiw.

Sounds like a voltage regulator for the tach would be in order.  Don't
know how much current a tach pulls but I can't imagine it would be over
one amp, so an LM317 or 7812 would probably work.  Only drawback here is
the 1.3 volts or so bias the regulator would need, so to put exactly 12
volts to your tach, you'd need to make sure the input voltage was at
least 13.3 - probably not hard to do except maybe at idle.  Doing this
would at least take one variable out of the equation.
