Subject: inner rocker
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

       I just got an inner rocker today from wolfsburg west, the thing looks 
like its been in the floor getting kicked around for a while. One end is bent 
over almost 90 degrees, the lip where the inner welds to the outter is 
tweaked in several places, it's creased in one place. the bit where it welds 
to the floor is wavy all the way down and dented in in one spot. All fixable, 
but it seems kind of shody. packing was not damaged and it was well packed so 
I assume it left them that way. Any one else had this problem with WW lately? 
I know I did buisiness with them a few years back and was happy with every 
thing.
    On the plus side the packing was excellent, the even used the peanuts 
that disolve in water.
