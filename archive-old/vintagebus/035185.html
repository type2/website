Subject: Re: [VB] truck drivers on my road trip :(

Clara writ:
&quot;or write in large letter on the back of it &quot;40hp at work, please just pass&quot;
&quot;

Someone used to sell these stickers and I cannot remember who...  Does
anyone know who still makes these?

I think a few others were &quot;Too slow?  Too bad!&quot; and &quot;Never get behind an old
VW&quot;.

Those are a little tacky for me, but I like the 40HP idea and the previously
mentioned hazard triangle.


Thanks,
