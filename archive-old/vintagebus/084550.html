Subject: [VB]  1963 singlecab 1 ton options

 Well my 63 singlecab came with 15 inch wheels, and I believe that it is a 1 ton option, because I had to relpace the rear brake driums and they were a one year only option, and cost $300 from Wolfsburg West.
Beware your 63 singlecab 1 tonner. 
 I will get behind the sppedometer and check what the code is, that was intersting info Karl.

Previous posts say
&quot;Alas, I have no M-code plate; which is why I asked for help from the
list! There are only two rudely torn bolt holes and an impression
where the plate once was.

I'll check both speedometers that came with the bus (hmmm...now that
becomes more interesting). I think the original is in a box out back
somewhere. Thanks for the help.

Are there any other foolproof ways to determine original
configuration, short of getting a &quot;birth certificate&quot; from VW?

Do you have M code M 215?  [THAT is the M code for 1500 engine AND 1 ton]
What is the ratio marked on the back of your speedometer?!!!!!
A bus that used 15&quot; wheels will have W0,77 stamped on the back.
A bus that used 14&quot; wheels will have W0,80 stamped on the back.
It will be stamped into the back of the speedo. The blue paint number is the
build date.&quot;
