Subject: Re: [VB] jerome trip

Jerome was fun... pretty mellow I missed out of the James Brown  
unfortunately.   I've been wanting to hear some James Brown recently, but I don't have it 
on 8-track.   Did listen to Paranoid  at Jerome, though, that was cool.  It's 
like lullaby music, reallly soothing.   I didn't get to look at all the buses, 
as whenever I'd walk around I'd end up going blah blah blah with someone. 
stayed out of the sun as much as possible.  camped in a circle of buses that was 
strategically located AWAY from the bongos,  w/everett &amp; wade &amp; darrell 
kombimonster &amp; greg &amp; a couple others, close to JPs camp, so I was over there a 
bunch too.  there were tents and EZ ups and lots of shade a lawn chairs, and a 
fire pit, and people brought in more ice for the coolers... a good set up.   did 
have a couple local teenagers who seemed quite adequately drunk wander over 
Saturday night and attempt to top up my drink with bad cheap rum, managing to 
pour a bunch of the rum on me, kinda embarrassing, I had to change.   Ruined my 
drink too... that rum was nasty.   tossed it on the fire, and it sort of 
burned.   They were nice kids, but I had to tell them to get the &amp;^$^ away.   i 
didn't actually see the band, but heard that the lead singer was of unclear 
gender.   (dude looks like a lady?) 
Met Craig with the evil alumium case finally, (I wasn't bored, just needing 
more coffee) but missed meeting beto and ricky fu, who were rumoured to be 
around.   I think the BC canadians edged me out on the long distance award.   

Bus ran fine... good bus. pat pat.   Hope to see folks at the Apple Valley 
show outside of Yakima on Sunday.   Naches, WA
