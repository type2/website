&gt; The time is coming when I will need to cut and pry the damaged metal
&gt; off the
&gt; rear of the wrecked '69 to remove the motor. It is the original motor

&gt; 130k on it. Was rebuilt about 10k ago and is sporting shiny new SP
&gt; heads. It
&gt; has been a faithful motor and I have no reason to believe it was
&gt; damaged in
&gt; the wreck.
&gt; 
&gt; I plan on keeping the motor as a spare for the '67 which has a good
&gt; motor(
&gt; all the oil stays inside the engine) After the '69s motor is removed
&gt; what
&gt; steps should I take to ensure that it stays in fine working order?

Drain the oil.  Put in a couple of quarts of heavy (50W) oil.  Tilt the
engine hither and yon to spread the oil about its insides.  Drain the
oil.  Put a few squirts of the oil through the spark plug holes. 
Rotate the engine.

A good parts outfit can provide you with dessicating plugs that screw
into the heads in place of the plugs.  These will soak up humidity and
warn you of too much humidity by turning colors.

Keep the engine in a place with fairly constant temperatures and cover
it to prevent dust buildup.

Visit the engine now and then and say nice things to it.  Turn it over
now and then to keep the seals free.  Pat it nicely.  Promise it that
it will get to come out and play again.
