Subject: Mofoco =  Manassas Bugout

Bill,
      While we're on the topic of show rip offs. I'd like to add the Bugout 
held in Manassas Virgina.  It is done twice yearly.  Anyone attend there 
lately?  I will never enter a vehicle there ever again.  HOWEVER, if you 
live in the eastern US and want a good place to find some good/rare parts, 
this IS the place to be.  OBTW, the people who attended were very friendly 
and the state of Virginia, particularly this part are beautiful in the 
summer.  The drag racing was pretty cool too.  I guess my problem is with 
the promotors more than anything.  Sorry for offending any Bug Out fans.

Mark
