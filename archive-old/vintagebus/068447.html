Subject: Re: [T2] Vaccum Hose Attachment

&gt; I have a dual vaccum distributor hooked up to a 34 pict 3 carb.  I attached a hose from the left side of the
carb to the domed side of the vaccum can and a hose from the front of the carb to the back of the vaccum can
(flat side facing shroud).
&gt;
&gt; Is this correct or backward?

Does the hose going to the flat side [inner] have vacuum at idle?

If no, then it is wrong.

If yes, does the engine idle speed up when you disconnect it?

Does the hose going to the domed side [outer nipple] have vacuum when you open the throttle?

If no, then it is wrong.

If yes, it is correct.

Manifold vacuum, vacuum at idle, is for the retard side.
Ported vacuum, vacuum appears when you open the throttle, is for the advance side.

You cannot static time a dual vacuum distributor correctly. You have to use a timing light, vacuum has to be
applying retard and be connected and working. Sounds like you have a 71 bus? 211-905-205Q dist?
Timing Set At:: 5deg ATDC _at_ 800-950rpm w/strobe, vacuum hose(s) connected.
