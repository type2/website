I don't get it
this list has all types of people lurking
 (or like me opening their big fat mouths. )
but we are TINY compared to all the VW's on the road.
If i see or hear of any vw broken down and SOL. 
I do wad-eve-ahs i can to fix da situation.
i don't care what list he/she is on or not on.
they are driving a VW
that's enough...
Shaka,
Ken
(or should i say Aloha)
