   You don't see to many personalised plates here in Orygun due to the cost.  
But in Va they were fairly cheap.  Hence my 59' std ended up with one.  This 
plate was a great help when speeding red necks roared up upon the back of my 
bus.  The plate said &quot;SLOOOOW&quot;.  
     Peace, Love, and Happy Busing,
