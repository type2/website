money however was burning a hole in my pocket, so I relieve
some of the heat by forking out some reasonable cash for
what I was told is a 25 HP '54 motor in so so shape as I was
walking out.  It looked vintage, so I bit and got reeled
in.  Really don't know what Im doing when it comes to
engines.

My question is, what the heck did I buy....  really?  Is
there a spot on the web where I can look up the engine
numbers and find out?  Or is there a gracious soul out there
that can give me a hand.  Here are the specifics and out of
the ordinary details that I noticed about it:

The numbers on the block are 1690471.
- -- - -- -
early 36hp and also the 36hp motors (through end of 55) have engine number
starting with -1- or -20- .    53 was the last year for 25hp.    yours would
be early 57 bus motor .  doesn't the idiot book have these numbers?   or was
it -1- 690 471?   that would be a 54 bug 36hp motor,  you see , w/ the -dash-
 there is a difference
................
 The generator stand
is cast one piece with the block. (to what year did this
occur??)
- - - -
end of 36hp.  also does it have a screw cap for the oil filler?   35hp have a
spring with a pull out cap thing.  though a 25hp case could be drilled for
the later things to screw in to.
....
Has a solex 28 pci carb with a glass bowl.  all
steel fuel lines.  The air cleaner is a round symetrical
bubble type with the number 111.129.611b on it. It sits
directly on the carb. Also has LB609 and Knecht stamped on
it.  It has a spring loaded &quot;venturi&quot; type thingy at the fan
intake that goes in and out..   Never seen this before.
What the heck is it for?  It also has air ducts that go all
the way to the back of the engine underneath the cylinders.
Has the heater flaps located in this tube near the back half
of the engine.  Never seen this either.  The plug wires are
in good shape but look old.  They are clear (see thru) and
have the name &quot;beldon&quot; on them.  There are also steel tubes
next to the fan shroud just for the spark plug wires to go
thru on the way to the plugs.
 -- -- -
these are 25hp/36p things.  the spark plug wire tube was through early 36hp
(circa 56)
