&lt;&lt; Is there a difference is changing the tranny oil on a bus with reduction
boxes
 compared to another VW with out the boxes? Any tips for the tranny oil change
 on a bus. I just got my 55 Westy to run today. All 36 horses fired up with an
 oil change, new battery and a little bit of gas...Another one soon to be on
 the road!!&gt;&gt;
 
HI, Jimski in Reno,
First check your tranny oil level to make sure it has oil in the first place
and refill if nessary.  Drive around for a hour or two to stir up the crud in
there, and drain the center section then the reduction boxes after removing
the wheels.  Clean the magnetic plugs and replace the non-magnetic plugs with
magnetic plugs to help keep the steel shavings out of the bearing in the
future.  Refill the reduction boxes and then the center section.  If the
tranny oil was filthy then change it again at 500 miles.  If the oil was clean
or just a little dirty replace the tranny oil about 1,000 - 1,200 miles later
(Just like a new tranny would be done at that time also.).  There after
replace tranny oil at the very least every 30,000 miles, though you might be
better off replacing it every 20,000 mile due to the fact that there is no
filteration system in there to get the steel and brass shaving out of the oil
completely.  While you are under there make sure to top off your steering box
with the same oil as the tranny uses.
Lastly get the Bentley reprint of the VW pre-1968 bus shop manual ASAP!
