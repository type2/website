Subject: Re: Converting 15 Window to 23 Window

Hello all! :-)
As the proud owner of a REAL 21-window, it seems to cheapen the effect by
making one out of mismatched pieces.  Seems unfair somehow that people could
pass off &quot;fraudulent&quot; 21's and 23's!  After all, I paid plenty for the real
thing.  Wouldn't the owner feel like he had a fake?  Is it really worth all
that trouble?  Is this something I'll understand when I've been around bus
freaks a little longer? :-)
