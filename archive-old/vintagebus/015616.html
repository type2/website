Probably related to the dim tail lights - there's only so much power
that the relay wants to have going through it, and perturbing that
tends to make it either never trigger, or only trigger once.  You
might want to clean up the contacts on the switch, as well.

Silly question: is the antenna cable connected, and does it actually
go to an external antenna which is extended?  Does a normal AM radio
work in the same location (i.e., not getting interference from a
nearby power line or somesuch)?

Or bad connections to the relays.  I'd definitely clean up all the
