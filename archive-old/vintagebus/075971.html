Subject: Re: [VB] oil filter remote mount

I have and oil filter pump on my 65 westy, and it runs cool.  It has a header 
(I know, I know) but the thing is the 6V small gen pulley.   But its runs too 
cool in the winter. 

 So what I am saying is, is there another cause of heating you could find?   
Did you always have this filter pump on this motor, or did it start running 
hotter after you put on the filter pump

enquiring minds want to know
