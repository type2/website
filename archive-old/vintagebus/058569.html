Subject: Re: [VB] Parts needed

&gt; As a follow up to my request for help sourcing some parts I have some
&gt; updates.  For some reason I thought that the pre-heater tube was supposed
to
&gt; be on the right side when it should be on the left.  

Different sides for different years.  Early 1500 is one side late
1500/1600? is on the right side...no?  One side has a straight pipe the
other side has a curved pipe.  

Anyone else have a better idea on which is which??

Steve
