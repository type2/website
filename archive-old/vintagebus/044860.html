&lt;&lt; I was looking at some extra white shift knobs I had laying around this 
weekend
 and I noticed one is white and one is more of an ivory.  Different years,
 Bus vs. Bug, or ?  I thought they were all just white...  the price I pay
 for only paying attention to commericals.  ;)
 
 Anybody have one of those shift knobs with the little shift pattern in it?
   &gt;&gt;
actually earlier buses used 'ivory' dash knobs and shift knob, later buses 
used 'silver beige' (grey) ones.  the grey really isn't very grey.  changed 
aroun 62 or 63
