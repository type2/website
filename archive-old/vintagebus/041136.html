So rather that pull the engine and tranny out again after just replacing the
front mount and doing a quick reseal on the nose cone, I decided to just put
the wheels back on and see if I could get a better feel for what was going
on.

All ran fine around the block. Nice and smooth with no indications of a
problem anywhere. So on to a longer voyage of around 30 miles. Everything
was fine except for the fact that I still had the coupler a little too loose
leaving a bit of extra slop in the shifting. No big deal.

On the way back though, I noticed that when in lower speeds such as taking
off from a stop light, I was getting some mad vibrations. So i pull over at
Exxon and check out to see if my bus was gonna just fall apart. Actually to
make sure that nothing had come looe somehow such as a drum or anything. All
echecked out ok and the engine was running strong as ever. So onward to the
farm. Avoided all the lights possible to keep from having to drop down to
the speeds that the vibes are worst at. Got home fine.

So up on the jackstands sits the bus now, cold and lonely. Waiting for me to
cure it's sickness which is beginning to seem more and more likely like a
terminal disease. So the exploratory surgery begins. Put on the scrubs and
get to work.

First observation found that the spacer from te outer bearing to the drum
seems to be binding up when the drum is properly torqued. It seems to be a
problem with the amount of pressure being applied to it by the rear seal. I
have attempted to lube the seal and the spacer to see if there is any change
but no avail. So what to do? New seals seem in order as well as the usual
gaskets and O rings. Is there anything else that I should pay close
attention to? This conclusion verifies the sounds which i was getting. The
vibration was from the binding and the knocking was fom the tranny trying to
jump out of the bus. Also it must be the reason for the squeeling as I turn
a corner, considering the drum and center section of the outer bearing turns
yet the spacer rides along them not turning.

Make sense? I think I may just have this licked yet!
