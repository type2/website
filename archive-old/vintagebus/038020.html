Hi Andy,
We were given a motor years ago that had had a piston, cylinder, connecting 
rod, and head replaced.  The piston/rod was so out of balance from the rest 
of the pistons/rods that the engine sheet metal screws would alomost loosen 
completely after 2,000 miles from the vibration.  So in the interest of 
making it run better we tore down the engine to the short block.  Replace all 
of the rods, and since we were in there the bearings.  The bearing had only 
10,000 miles on them since the complete rebuild at the VW dealership in 
Texas.  All four rod bearing had grooves in them from metal shaving flowing 
through them.  Repaired and balanced engine, installed a filter pump setup.  
10,000 miles later the crankshaft broke due to being ground with 90 degree 
angles where the bearing journals met the webs instead of having a proper 
radius there.  When the engine was taken apart the new rod bearing with 
10,000 miles on them looked new!  Slightly polished and no grooves from 
pieces of metal flake going through them.

&lt;&lt;It does seem like a good idea but the external filters I've seen hang so 
low.  I would be afraid of knocking the thing off! &gt;&gt;
Agreed!  That is why we like the filter and pump in one setup.  Unfortunitly 
there is only one no-name pump of this kind being made right now that is 
worth a damn.
