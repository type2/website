First the bus stuff.I am looking fir two 15&quot; crowfoot wheels as I need to
mount the new tires.It was warm so I went to the garage the single is
wintering in and started it up and did the driveway run.I would have driven
more but it is still filled to cab hight with stuff from my move.

Two different stories.

The bomber in 50ft of ice,a 17 or 24(plenty still flying),I forget was
excavated and parted.They were really after the P38 escort squadron that was
with it and it was restored.I have a link somewhere to the compleated P38 I
will send along once I find it.

 The one that burned was a B29,only 2 still flying I think.After two seasons
of work and one death! it was ready to go.They did the runups,taxied and
were rolling for takeoff when a tool box became unsecured hit the APU
damaging the fuel tank and starting the fire.A truly sad sight that was.

If you have never had the experince of seeing something like a four engine
piston bomber in person I suggest going to see an airshow in your area.I
call ahead and find when the planes arrive and show up for that,you can
usually get a good look at them after it is on the parking ramp from the
crew.If they are offering flights take one,you will not be disappointed.I
had the opprutinity to see a rear gathering of piston aircraft this summer
at my local museaum 2 B17's,1 B24,2 B25's,the MATS Connie,1 C47,3 P51's,3
AT6 and the big one a B29.This all looked so awsome on final and the park
ramp was packed.I wish I had pictures but I saw the planes doing a flyby at
work and drove straight to the airport.

&gt; I remember seeing the show but I don't remember what
&gt; happened.
&gt; Did they get the plane out?
&gt; 
&gt; John,
And now the rest of the story, With a years effort in
the cold and snow, a team dug out of about fifty feet
of ice a perfectly preserved WWII Bomber (like finding
a perfect Barndoor Bus in an old shed) that made an
emergency landing with engine troubles and abandoned
for fifty years to be covered with snow and ice.
M
...They
started it up to fly it home and as they were getting
ready to start taxing down the runway, it seems that
someone 'forgot' to tighten a fuel line and the
leaking fuel cought fire and quickly spread to engulf
the entire plane, and the crew could only stand by in
horror and watch it burn to the ground(snow)... 
So with the history of bus fires, it's funny you
should compare it to the famous 'found' WWII Bomber.
Be careful with the torch.
