&gt; OK then. Where is a reasonable source for 356 pulleys and which belt? Will 
&gt; the conti 900 work?

Hi Andy,
We have not been able to find a source for the Porsche generator pulley yet.  
Perhaps Ronnie will have connections in the direction!  As for belt size Matt 
Roberds kindly deciphered the belt numbers we tried below.

Snip&gt; Stock 905 mm  35.6 in (Will not work with Porsche upper pulley!)
Fresh Start 13345 10AV0875  875 mm  34.4 in (Results in 2.4:1 ratio, but had 
only about half the Porsche spacers between the pulley halfs.)
Gates       7340      864 mm  34.0 in  (Results in 2.75+:1 ratio, but 
requires additional Porsche or VW shims between pulley halfs to be not too 
darned tight.) &lt;Unsnip
