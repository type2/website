I've been welding up the many holes that the series of POs of my 65
Westy deemed necessary to drill in to her.  Why, I'll never know!  I've
got a question of which holes need to stay.  On the upper part of the B
pillar behind the front doors, there were white plastic plugs filling
what look like factory punched 1&quot; diameter holes.  Does anyone know what
these were for?

On Russ Harmons very original green Westy at OCTO I think there were
round plastic coat hooks there, but I'm not sure.  This bus has the
factory threaded seat belt mounting holes in the seat stands(walk
through).  Might these holes be put there for a future shoulder belt
mounting bolt??  The holes are symmetrical with each other and are
located about 2 inches below the roof line.  Thanks for any input.

S.
