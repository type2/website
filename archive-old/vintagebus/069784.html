Subject: JunkRunner's Notebook 

Mark, list,


I envision a Dick Tracy CrimeStopper's Notebook for part scavengers...


maybe Karl &amp; Harry's JunkRunner's Notebook. 




Get the fusebox clip and male-male electrical connectors from bugs. Get the 
remote oil cooler bracket from an Audi. Get the rear script from 68-71 bays. 
Etc. 




Where are the voltage drops mounted in Golfs and Jettas? What do they look like? 




 Hello All  I have tried all of the voltage drops that they show in the rags, 


 most of them didn't work worth a damn . The best I found was the voltage drop 


 that VW used in the golfs,jettas for the inside blower fans . the terminal in 


 the middle gives exactly 6 volts. heavy enough even to run a 6 volt gas 


 heater. later and have fun  Mark Dearing  Salem Import Service Salem Va
