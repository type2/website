Subject: Bouncing Needle

Just got my bus on the road in the last couple of weeks after being stored
in the garage for the winter. Great to be driving it again!!

However, the needle of the gas gauge will read properly one minute and now
bounce back and forth for 30 seconds at a time. Is it the ground wire?? Sign
of gauge failure???........... It is not related to bumps in the road and
had been working properly the last five years......
