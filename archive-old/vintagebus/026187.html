&gt; Hi Dave,
&gt; The stock bolts are N 10 119 1   Bolt, hex. head M 12X1.5X25 DIN 961 -

The way to read the bolt specs is this:

M Metric
12 Shaft ( not head) diameter in mm ( millimeters) 12 mm or 1.2 cm

1.5 Thread pitch 1.5 MM between threads ( in english this number is
expressed in threads per inch, metric uses the actual distance between
threads) In metric there are 5 or more thread pitches available for
every diameter shaft. In english there are usually only 2, UNC and UNF
(coarse and fine)

25 length of shaft from where shaft meets head ( not outside of head) in
MM ( 2.5 cm) 

( Is this right for a spring plate bolt?  I thought they were longer)

DIN 961 is a metric/German standard that means that it is a hex head
bolt, with the head size standard ratio in proportion to the shaft
diameter size, keeping the mechanical advantage of the bolt in a
relatively standard range...

Now, the thing that you are not told by the  bolt number is the tensile
strength, what we in &quot;'merica&quot; call &quot;bolt grade&quot; and what them metric
types call &quot;property class&quot;. The VW number(N 10 119 1), however, does
have a property class specification. You should use a bolt with metric
property class at least 10.9 ( stamped on the end head of the bolt)
which is roughly equivalent to a SAE grade 8. You could use a 9.8
property class bolt, and you would probably be ok, assuming it isnt the
only bolt carrying the weight. This is equivalent to a SAE grade 7 bolt.
Grade 7 bolt has a tensile strength rating of 133,000psi minimum, where
a grade 8 has a 150000 strenght rating. So if you are as fat as me, use
the stronger one....:)
