Hi, guys!

Lookin' for body trim for a '65 Deluxe Walkthrough. Since there's NO 
interior, I'm also looking for seats, too. I don't intend to restore to 
perfection.... actually I'm going the &quot;restification&quot; route.  Something to 
reupholster with the proper frames for a Splittie would suffice. I got this 
bus running/driving with all lights/electric working, few dents and needing 
cargo floors, pretty cheap, so I'm not feeling obligated to restore/show it. 
I'm going to drive it 'til one of us is dead and collect smiles along the 
way!!

Thanx!
