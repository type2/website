&gt;  I replaced my single master cylinder with a new dual 67 type.  I had a
&gt;  few problems but with much thanks to you guys, all is well.
&gt;  
&gt;  Now I have no brake lights.  I have tried putting the brake warning
&gt;  light on the front and back of the master cylinder as well as swapping
&gt;  the wires.  Still nada.  I have checked the fuses and swapped out most
&gt;  for new.  Still nada.  I checked my bulbs and they both look good.  I
&gt;  cleaned terminals and checked grounds but still....yup you guessed it,
&gt;  nada.  Once I find my volt/ohm meter and long test wire, I will check
&gt;  the long wire going from front to back but I don't think it's it.  Time
&gt;  has taught me that when something goes wrong look at what you %&amp;#$_at_ with
&gt;  last.  That would be the master cylinder.  I'm gonna go drink beer now
&gt;  and ferget bout it till morning.  Hope ya'll are having a good weekend!
&gt;  
try from the other end-  are all your fuses good?   Take your test light unde 
rthe bus- is there power to the sending unit at the MC?  there should be?   
if you cross the wires to each other at the MC sender and the lights come on, 
but the dont when you press the pedal, you MC sender if bad.
