&lt;&lt;  I already got the MC, but to my supruise it did not come with the rubber 
boot that goes on the pushrod thing.  Is this normal?&gt;&gt;
Hi Eric,
Yes, it is.  The later bus MC is mated up to a vaccume powered brake booster 
that seals off that end from dust.  We have not yet been able to find a boot 
to keep out road dust.  So we keep the nose pan on to keep alot of the 
dirt/dust/sand away from this and all the other linkages.  So far this has 
worked well for us over several years and lots of miles on our 1960 panel.
 
&lt;&lt;Oh yea one more question.  I put in a new outer rear axle seal in a couple 
weeks back and it is leaking again, I noticed my cv boot coming off the 
tranny center has a big tear in it.  Will this cause a nice spew of stay-lube 
on my backing plate? &gt;&gt;
       If you mean Sta-Lube tranny oil then no.  1968 and later buses (or 
heavily modified pre-1968 buses.) used CV joints which have grease in them.  
The buses up to 1968 model year from the factory used a swing axle boot to 
retain the oil inside and keep the road dust outside.  If this latter setup 
is what you have then the ansewer is yes.  Just slide under with a flashlight 
and see if the oil is following the axle tube out to the wheel area.
