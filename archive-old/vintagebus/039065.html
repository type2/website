&gt; As for lowering, it looks bad!   
&gt;Cut buses look bad, so?

Hey, you want to lower your bus?  Want to use a moldy watermelon rind
for a head liner?  Want to put a stereo in there that requires a
generator to run so you can hear it play Sheryl Crow in the next county?
How 'bout something simple like a pair of retractable front seat belts?

GO FOR IT!!!!

Everybody's got their preferences and the freedom to act on them.  Use
the information from this list to make sure that your modifications are
done properly and safely.  Also be aware that some mods are difficult if
not impossible to undo.  

So think very seriously about what you want your bus for (for me,
hauling friends, stuff, and driving on the scenic back roads of this
beautiful country), how long you plan to keep it (for me, forever!), and
if you plan to sell it later, will your mods decrease its value and/or
limit the potential market.  

And will you walk out of the grocery store some day to get in your bus
and look at it and say, &quot;What the f... was I thinking when I did THAT?&quot;
I figure people that take nice little imports cars, paint them
candy-apple-purple or green, and put on wheels that stick out 8 inches
past the fenders must suffer this dilemma frequently.

Just spewing forth my 2 cents worth.  Hey, that's my choice!
