I have a '65 deck lid that had a handle with a key. Turns out it was an old beetle handle that someone had put in there; maybe that's what you have. It fit into the keyway for the church key, but they had to take the churchkey cover off to get it in there. I keep it as an emergency spare in my bus just in case someone decides to steal my church key.

Thanks! Joe


&gt;I have just replaced the engine hatch on the 63 singlecab and there are a
&gt;couple of questions that I have.
&gt;The 63 uses a church-key to open it, the hatch I was given had a handle, it
&gt;looks as if there was a key in the middle sometime.
&gt;I removed the handle by taking off the 10 mm bolt, and lo &amp; behold it was just
&gt;like it used a church key.
&gt;
&gt;When did they start putting handles on the engine compartment, and can I just
&gt;take it off and use my church-key and it still is original
