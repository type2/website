&lt;&lt; I'm seeking some help understanding the evolution of the Split.  In
 particular a crewcab.  Can anyone summarize general changes? &gt;&gt;

Stephen I'll take a shot at this although there are many on this list more
expert than I. Fellow listees please don't flame me if I screw up on
something. Please preface everything that follows with I think or I've read.

1952? - First Pickups Made, bullet turn signals, Engine Louvres 8 stacked and
sticking out.

1958 - First Doubles made

1959 - starting handle removed

1961 - bullet turn signals changed to &quot;fish eye&quot;

1963 - pullout door handle replaced with fixed door handle,1500cc engine
introduced

1965 - Pickup Louvres reconfigured ( 3 across, 3 down), Wide rear window,
Locker bed door, fuel door, church key replaced on engine compartment

1966 - first 12 volts

1967 - first bay windows
- - - - - - 
sounds like you are using calender years, not modell years.   Yes, bay windows
were made in 67, but it was 68 model.  Yes, most 64 models have push button
handles, but the first few months of 64 production have the pull kind.  I
would bump most of this up a year to fit model year.   Oh, front turn signals
didn't happen till 55, all barndoors came w/semaphores.   Fuel doors w/o
church key came for the 67 models.
