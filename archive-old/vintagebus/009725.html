I got the 'ol 'cab all back together &amp; took a 400 mile trip last weekend.
It's starting to loosen up a little, kinda starting to act like a 1914.
The 3.88 gears help lots. We checked with a borrowed tach, 3500 _at_ 65 mph. I
took it on up to 80 mph just for a short stretch, it did that easily.
Oil temp runs 190 to 215, depending on whether up hill or down.
The reduction boxes are a whole lot quieter, I can even hear the stereo at
60 mph now.
We're going to Wichita, Ks from Harrison, Ark Mem weekend.Any of you in that
part of the world? Also, going to the June Bug show in Springfield, Mo on
June 3rd.
I'm still looking for the meaning of M code 195    Anyone???

Thanks for all the good advice from you folks.
