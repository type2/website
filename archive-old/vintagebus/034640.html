Well Everett I would send you pictures but I don't have a scanner.  I do 
however have a text ad on your site already.  BTW I do love your site.  I am 
trying to sell (deep breath)

1964 Beetle
1600 single-port that has just been freshened up with new electrics (except 
dizzy and coil, they checked out fine) new fuel pump and newish Bugpack 
header and dual quiet-packs and the valves done!  Zues is rolling on Empi-5 
spokes and new tires.  I've replaced the brakes all around, the clutch, front 
beam. . . you get the idea.  He has a cheap respray- Red that will get by for 
a while.  He has been loved on a lot but needs a good home.  I need a bus.  
So, pass this on to your friends if you think they'd be interested.  There 
are 3 price levels, the most being $3000.  You could drive him home no matter 
where you live.  There are many more details I could fill any interested 
parties in on.  He and I are both in Lincoln, NE but I'll be leaving town in 
a couple days for a couple weeks no where near a computer.  (CAMPING!!:))  
However, I'll return all e-mails and whatevers as promptly as possible.  

Also, I'm looking for a split Kombi or 13/15 window.  Turn-key, ugly and in 
the mid-West preferred.  Thanks and always the best regards,

Benj.
