Subject: Re: [VB] where does my spare go?

Is it a bench seat bus? If it is then it goes behind
the seat. You would have to load pics to thoms site
for me to believe otherwise. Take a pic, that would
help out better.

&gt; is no well above the engine compartment, nor behind
&gt; the front bench seat, 
&gt; wich was never cut. there are bolts to mount it on
&gt; the front of the busd, but 
&gt; ive never heard of those coming from the factory or
&gt; dealer installed. anybody 
&gt; got any ideas???
&gt; also, does anybody know if westfalia ever did paint
&gt; jobs?
