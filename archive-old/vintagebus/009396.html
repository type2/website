There was a nice fellow at Blue Ridge that did this with an early bus.  A group of us in splits were laboring up the parkway and here comes this guy zoooomin around us and on up the mountain like it was nothing!  He didn't convert it to an upright, but made a rear apron and kept the stock fan and used a progressive carb.  I think he also fabricated a rear hanger for the motor too.  It was pretty slick.  
FWIW, he said he was pleased with the results, but that he would never do it again or recommend it to anyone.  It might have been because he also went to (had to?) an IRS bus tranny.  There was something about the conversion that turned what he was hoping would be straight forward swap into a nightmare. 

I liked it though, perhaps because I wasn't there to help build it....

First of all thanks to all who replied to my post about what engine I should
put into my 67 Kombi. Well I've decided to use my good running 75 1.8 bus
engine and convert it to an upright.  &lt;snorp&gt;

TIA    Britt...in Calif.
