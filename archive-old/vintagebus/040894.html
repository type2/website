Good morning list,

I'm sure this one has been covered before.  I checked the archives though
and I'm still unsure of the differences in inside rear view mirrors.  I need
a mirror for a '56.  The original is about 5&quot; x 2&quot; and the arm mounts to the
lower center of the mirror.  My collection of bits has several mirrors but
none like the original.  They are all about 6&quot; x 2 1/2&quot; and the arm mounts
to the left of center of the mirror.  Are the larger mirrors for later
buses?

Thanks for the help!
