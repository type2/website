What's snow?

My '54 had Hakkapeliitta studded tires on it when it came over from
Sweden, ja!

Am I the only one who notices the irony of Steve posting about snow
tires now that he's moved to AZ?

&gt; But don't try to pronounce &quot;Hakkapeliitta&quot; in mixed company.  Yes,
&gt; that's how it's spelled..  I'm looking at the word right now.
