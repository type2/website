Subject: Cruisin' in the Camper

Well, not really cruisin, more like a daredevil half mile run...

I pulled the engine out of the Ghia and transplanted it to the '65 Sundial
camper today.  About 20 minutes before dark, I hopped in, fired her up and
took off down the road.  Luckily we live in the country, so a half mile
down a country road with no plates, 1 headlight, a sticking gas pedal, 1
front brake, and a HUGE shift pattern is no big deal!  Sure it's a bit
dangerous, but I just had to get her on the road for a few minutes this
evening.  Tomorrow I replace the front brake hoses, fix the gas pedal, and
change the oil.  It was so cool driving my first splittie bus.  I can't
wait to do it when I'm not fearing for my life.

Now the Ghia gets to spend the winter having a little cosmetic surgery, and
a T4 engine transplant...
