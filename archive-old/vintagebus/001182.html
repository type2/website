Wow - I'm really sorry everyone - I was so tired I could barely write.  I
really like posting these updates and I like to try get them written down
before I forget all I did.

Anyway, I put the rear tires on and got the bus down off of the jackstands.
I torqued the axle nut to 217 ft. lbs. per Bentley and then ended up going
another 1/8 to 1/4&quot; rotation to get the cotter key holes to line up.  After
this, I started on the brakes.

I poured in some fluid and just started pumping the pedal and I heard fluid
squirting out somewhere.  Panic!  Turned out I had a loose bleeder screw.
At this point I figured I'd go get my infamous sister to help out so I drove
home and picked her up.  I had her watch the reservoir to make sure I didn't
run out of fluid and I went to each tire with my vaccuum pump (mityvac) and
drew fluid through each line.  The toughest by far was the wheel closest to
the MC (FL) - I pumped a long time before the fluid came surging through.
Despite the best intentions of the mityvac designers, this is by no means a
complete bleeding tool but it worked well for getting fluid in the the WC's
and through the lines.  The next step was to do the old pump and hold trick
on the brake pedal.  Kerry jumped up inside the bus and I would have her
pump the pedal a good 5 times.  She was a bit timid with the pedal until I
told her to hit it hard like she was mad and kicking me - that brought out
the strength in her right leg. :-)  Each bleeder gave up it's air within 2
bleeds - for good measure I would do 5 cycles or more of p&amp;h (pump and hold)
but no more air came out after 2 cycles so the old mityvac didn't do too
bad.  It kept us from having to actually plumb the system.  I added some
more fluid and sent Kerry inside to visit with grandma while I finished up.
I jacked up the rear of the bus and readjusted the brakes and then treated
the front the same and what a difference that made.  With the braided SS
lines and the readjusted shoes, I have about 3.5 to 4 inches of pedal travel
and then BAM - it just won't gonomo.  This bus has a GREAT feeling brake
pedal.

I adjusted the ebrake cables and then cleaned up shop.  This while fiasco
(including the wire wheel escapade) too from about 7:30 until 11:15.  I hope
my carb parts show up soon so I can do the break-in on the 1776.  I guess
I'll have to locate a camcorder so I can get the break in on tape.

I gotta get to work - later.
