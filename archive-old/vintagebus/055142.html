Subject: 6 Volts times 2 = 12v?

Howdy all,=20
I have been searching the archives learning all I can about the 6 volt vs. =
12=20
volt quagmire. Is it possible or desirable for my 63' camper to have two si=
x=20
volt batteries wired up in such a manner to: A) provide a coach battery for=
=20
ancillary 6-volt components and B) provide combined 12-volt current for a=
=20
stereo or other accessories?=20

Would I need a split-charge system to avoid the equalization effect of two=
=20
batteries hooked up together (parrallel or series I don't understand the=20
difference)? I don't know of any 6-volt split-charge systems currently=20
available. I talked to Hellroaring Technologies,  (=20
http://www.hellroaring_dot_com/ ) and they may come out with one in the near=20
future but do not offer anything now except a relay. I was thinking of=20
physically locating the main starting battery in the engine compartment whe=
re=20
it belongs and the second auxillary battery under the bench seat area.=20

Another possibility is using a dedicated 12-volt battery for the auxillary=
=20
needs, charging it up every night with a battery charger/tender and leaving=
=20
the 6-volt battery currently in use for starting &amp; coach power needs.=20

Ideally though, I would like to have a setup similar to the way many=20
motorhomes are equiped. In the systems I have seen, there is a selector=20
switch (within driver reach) to utilize either one of two seperate batterie=
s,=20
or both, and also when plugged in to shore power both batteries charge=20
simultaneously. Some even have a 12-volt to 110vAC inverter on-board to=20
provide temporary 110v AC power. It looks as if shore power was once an=20
option for my bus as the dinette lamp is 110v AC and there is a female jack=
=20
installed in the rear bumber (disconnected however). Is any of this possibl=
e=20
or feasible in a 63' bus that is currently all 6 volt? What is the best way=
=20
to go?=20

Thanks,=20
