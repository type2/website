Hi Volks,
Yes, and when we last handled the parts of a repro bumper we noticed that 
they tack welded here and there instead of the stronger longer beads of welds 
VW did.
   Darin Matsuno had our powder coater do a set of bumpers (We saw them at 
the shop.), so you should inquire with him about the cost.
