Well I finally did it!  I picked up the early 57 15 window at Gary LaVere's 
Shop in Martinez, CA.

I left wedsnday morning from phoenix along with a fellow club member named 
chris who just happens to be a flat bed trucker.  We took my fathers 4 door 
4x4 ch_at_&amp;y truck and drove all the way to the bay area.  

Gary had given us some great dirctions to his shop, the hotel and to his 
house where the bus was at.  We didn't get lost a single time.  We picked up 
the trailer that e bought at a painters house and swung over to see the bus.

It was under a arp holding up the fence so i was wondering about the 
condition.  Turns out that the only thing it needs is some floor de-rusting 
and rockers!  All the mouldings were there, middle seat, rear seat, 
jailbars....everything even the original panels with trim.  Love at first 
sight.

We took tons of pictures and after excavating it out of the backyard where 
there are some other NICE project busses, loaded her up.

We went back to the shop and hung out for a while with some listees ( sorry 
im tyed and cant remember names right now ) and grabbed some extra stuff 
alike a split case tranny and headed home.  

So special thanx to Gary Lavere of LaVere's Restorations...he is truly one 
cool guy. Stop by his shop and see what I mean.

Oh and Thom.....I saw your 54.  Pretty cool!
