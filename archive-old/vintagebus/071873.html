&lt;&lt; Well, the spedo is definately not responding. All I get is clicks out of 
it. The cable end in the grease cape is taken care of and is turning ok but 
the spedo is doing nothing.

I would check the connection under the speedo.  Then remove the left axle cap 
, and spin the cable by hand.   I can do this fast enough for the speedo to 
respond.  it's a funny angle to hold thecable in one hand and see the speedo, 
but it can be done.   If all the speedo does is click, yup it's an unhappy 
camper.   

next step, remove speedo from bus, labeling wires/dash light plugs.  undo 
speedo cable.   you don't have to completely remove teh two screw that hold 
the speedo in, just loosen both enough, and you can rotate the speedo and 
remove it.
   
then spin thingy in speedo and double check it's toast

install replacement speedo.  now you get to choose whether to install it 
upside down or not.  and I'd replace any faded plastics for the lights.  Your 
choice of colours!!!
