I seem to remember (or was that imagined) someone mentioning a CD with all the part numbers on it for splitties, sort of like the old parts books.  I would love to have a soft copy of the part numbers for everything my bus needs so I could just go through piece by piece to see what I still need.  Does this exist or is it time for me to put my parts book and quick typing skills to work and make myself one?  It must be late as I am rambling.
