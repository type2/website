Having jetted a bunch of Webers on racecars (DCOE) over the years, the best
advise that I can give you is... Don't drill jets!!  What happens is that
later on you start foolin' with it again and don't remember what size jets are
in it.  So... you pull it apart and see 135 stamped on the jet.  You want just
a tad richer so you order up 140s.  Except a couple of years ago you drilled
the jets.  The 140s have an unexpected result.  Motor seems like it's still
too lean???  How can that be???  Buy the jets.  They're not that expensive,
and you WILL need them.

Weber main jets are sized in mm. A 135 has an orfice of 1.35mm.  If you must
drill the mains, you'll need a metric drill set.  a 61-80 set won't do it! BTDT.

Who's reference books are you using?  

Recommended reading:

Phillip K. Smith's &quot;The Scientific Design of Exhaust and Intake Systems&quot;
(Classic Motorbook or Bentley)
Weber Technical Manual
Passani's two Weber books (Autobook in the UK.  Might be out of print)
A. Graham Bell's &quot;Performance Tuning in Theory and Practice&quot; (Bentley, I think.)
Haynes Weber book.

P-mail me for specifics.
