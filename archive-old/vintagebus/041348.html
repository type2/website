Hey Now

    For the last couple of months I've been on the lookout for a style of
front door locking mech that was found on my early 64 21window. I don't
have the part number here in front of me, but it was the pull style handle
with a turn key lock(see late 50's bugs).  Luckely my 64 came with two
really nice front door handles but I need two more for another project(the
daily driver).  So far I haven't been able to find a repo(although Oval
Motorsport in Federal Way, Wa has a excellent BUG style).  As I understand
it, the bus version has an added hook of metal on the release part where
it did not have that on the bug version.  I made a few calls and found
some NOS stuff for some amazing amount of cash, yet I was lookin' for
something that wouldn't be such a debt on the checkbook.  In any case, I
got a couple of questions.

Does this style of lock need both the chrome handle(and lock) plus the
release(inside door handle to the release on the outside) to work?  What I
mean by this is, is the release mech different in anyway from the
non-locking style?  

I believe we mentioned this early, but I'm pretty sure I could go back to
a VW dealer and see if they have the keycode so I could get a new set of
keys made for the 64.

And lastly, does anyone have any of these handles for sale?  With keys
hopefully.    

In the quite possible event that I'm having a pipedream in tryin' to find
this setup, I was wondering what you all do to protect your type 2? I
really didn't want to go with the 67 style locking handle that attaches to
both ends...but it is an option.

any thoughts?
