&gt; &lt;&lt; Are the front doors the same on the '65 as on the '67?
&gt;  I need a '65 and have an opportunity to purchase a '67.  &gt;&gt;
&gt; Hi Rick,
&gt; Yes they are.  Except for the manufacture date stamped in them!
Eric&amp;Barb
&gt;

Didn't 65 doors use swing out handles? Or are they the same as 67 pushbutton
handles?
The pushbutton handle uses 2 screws thru the door, so he would need to drill
2 holes if the 65 doors have swing handles......
From vin # 1222026 to 216190000 handle # 211 837 205F was used.
Starting vin # 217 000 001 handle # 211 837 205K was used.
Is the only difference between these handles the key code? F being T code
and K being L code?
