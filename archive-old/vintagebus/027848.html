&gt; I have not had great experiences with these plugs.  I have tried them in
&gt; type 1 motors and they seemed to foul because of a little oil consumption

I have to say my experience has been opposite. Ive used them for a few
years exclusively and have only changed them around every 3rd oil change
9-10K miles and havent had any trouble. The local flaps dont evey carry
the W8ACs anymore.
