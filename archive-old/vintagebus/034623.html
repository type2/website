&lt;&lt; i am going to remove the transaxle from the parts bus soon and after 
 checking the archives i came up a little short. can someone kinda walk me 
 through it. easiest way possible. should i remove it drum to drum? &gt;&gt;
Hi Bob,
Remove engine, front tranny mounting nuts.  Loosen rear axle nuts, reduction 
boxes to swing plate, and rear tranny mounting bracket bolts.  Remove shock 
asorbers, clutch cable, flex brake lines.  Jack up VW onto jack stands or our 
favorite a log cabin kind of pile of 4X4&quot;s.  Then remove the rear wheels, 
reduction boxes to swing plate bolts and lastly remove the rear tranny mount 
bolts.  Then slide the tranny out the rear.

&lt;&lt;are seized and crusty king &amp; links worth saving?&gt;&gt;
As long as they are not sloppy there is a good chance that they only need a 
cleaning out of the link pins and regreasing.  Take apart the link pins to 
check for wear and make sure the outer cover plugs of these have thier grease 
outlet holes cleaned out to allow the old grease to be able to leave the 
outer side of the link pins!
