   I'm sure my following coments will piss off a few of you. Please private
email me and don't smear me on the list. These are my comments and not
anyway conected with the London Bridge Bullis club

  Have rec lots of positive comments and a few negitive. Others have stated
positives. The negitives were full portajohns, the big green dumster and the
campground cost. All of this will be presented to the campground management.
If you have any coments please private email me and they will be shown to
the campground also. We do have a possible alternate campsite that might be
a good one at Windsor beach area. and we will be checking it out for next
year.
   Bryon made it home and I have rec. quite a few emails from listies who
state there insurance is good for 30 days after bill of sale date. Weather
he was right or wrong i don't know and its over as far as i am concerned so
let it drop.
   The London Bridge Bullis used the 2 club awards ( the 7 members vote and
the majority rules)  this year and we decided to give them as hard luck
awards. One went to Shawn from Albuq. N.m. for his cracked engine block
(cracked from the small plugs you should tap and plug to the rear seal area)
and the other went to Bryon for his hard trip to the show. Next year they
might go to the worst or most original paint.
  Every bus there but the locals was driven over 200 miles each way with
most over 500 miles each way. No trailor queens at BBB shows. The so called
(  by Thom and Doug and a few others) bondo, duct tape, rusty bus group
donated and raised around $2500.00 ( exact $$ after all bills are paid) for
the Arizona Childs Group for aboused and neglected kids. How much does the
VW Classic, the Sacromento show the Phoenix bugorama, and all the other
magazine shows donate? I would assume that most is donated to the promotors
pockets. We had an 8 year old girl who rec. money from last years show tell
us  ( in a letter that I hope Dave will print in the next NEATO newsletter)
how great it was to have her own new white underware and not have to share
underware with her sisters all the time, and how much she loved her new
black shinny shoes and 1st new dresses. If you did not have teary eyes after
that and other letters you should be declared dead. Not bad for a bunch of
unpainted, duct taped, rusty bus owners who drive there buses many miles to
shows. Unlike Thom F when I invited him to the BBB show this year. His quote
&quot; I don't do any  buses by the whatever shows&quot;. The only other bus club i
know of that donates any amount to charities is the Arizona Bus Club that
donates Thousands each year to the Arizonia  Childrens Burn Clinic. Again
not bad for a group of duct taped, not polished, some rust bus owners. I
don't agree with alot of the stuff that goes on at Jerome or BBB sometimes,
but you cant please all of us. You should have heard one of our club members
when I got on him for the rap music this year. He did not know how it got
played. I hate rap, but some like it. I don't like drum circles either, but
to each his own as long as they don't bother me. But the bus rappers and
drummers did donate, and big at each show this year. The bottom line for me
is helping the kids. Maybe some of you don't have kids and it is hard to
follow me. I've gone on enough. Hope I didn't offend you guys to much, rag
on me it you want, but email me you addrerss and I will send you some kids
letters and the picture when we give them the $2500.
