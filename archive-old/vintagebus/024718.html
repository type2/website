We have seen this material in the past at Hancok Fabrics in Oklahoma

&gt; Greetings and happy holidays all
&gt; At one of this summers shows, I think SOTO at Long Bch, there was a bus with
&gt; a Route 66 patterned set of curtains. A search of all the local fabric stores
&gt; has turned up zilch. I really liked that pattern, does anyone know where to
&gt; find it?
