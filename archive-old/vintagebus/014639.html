&lt;&lt; So the inner race is supposed to stay on the spindle?   &gt;&gt;
Hi Matt,
Sorry we screwed up that one.  The inner bearing is supposed to stay together 
and come off the spindle completely due to being held in the drum by the 
grease seal just inboard of the inner bearing.  Definitely get the Bentley 
ASAP.  Eric&amp;Barb
