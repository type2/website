I scored a FAG rebuild kit at my local shop for $12.00 all the right stuff
inside
too(for a 67).You just have to look and ask the right questions and you
will find
what you need.

&gt; Hello Everyone!
&gt;
&gt;     I have a question about a late (really late they only made nine
&gt; hundred more
&gt; after mine) 67 deluxe bus with the hard to find master cylinder It has
&gt; two brake
&gt; sensors on the left side and two brake lines on the right. I need new
&gt; bushings
&gt; for the reservoir base that push into the cylinder and a rebuild kit or
&gt; I need a
&gt; whole new master cylinder it bleeds like mad!  Can anyone help with a
&gt; company name that might make a rebuild kit or replacement!
&gt;
&gt;                                           Thanks for your Responses!
&gt;                                                        Eric Lykens
