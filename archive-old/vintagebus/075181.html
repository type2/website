Subject: Re: [VB] What the son said [67 rebuild - cracked case]

&gt;Didn't you mention in an earlier post that they promised you a replacement
&gt;case? Maybe the son doesn't know the difference between a &quot;case&quot; and a 
&gt;&quot;brace&quot;.
&gt;
OK .. the case on my rebuilt under warranty with them - is cracked.  I am 
just guessing, but maybe it was already cracked, or maybe the clunking noise 
I heard everytime I shifted - that sounded like the engine banging around in 
the back of the bus - was the reason for the crack.  So the case is going to 
be replaced - their cost - but what about the banging in the engine 
compartment, I wanted to know.  I asked was it a broken motor mount or 
transmission mount [is there such a thing?] and his answer was making a 
&quot;brace&quot; to stop the banging around in the back that they didn't believe me 
was going on 3 weeks ago before it started leaking oil.

Is that clearer ??  The mechanics that sold me the bus, installed the engine 
etc .. basically got it road ready, were the ones who did the tie rod and 
the center bushing .. another mechanic put the drag link in, and told me to 
go get an alignment right away.  Which I did .. which straightened the wheel 
.. which made steering better but not perfect and made a left U-turn not 
really possible.
