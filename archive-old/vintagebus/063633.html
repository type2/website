&gt; uh what is *Progressive Refinments* ?  jus asking
&gt; Ken

Hi Ken,
Progressive Refinements is kind of like a diary of VW production line.  It 
lists about 70% of the changes in parts and models coming off the assembly 
line almost day by day in the 50s and 60s starting somewhat monthly in 1943 
and our's ends just after 1967 model year.  To get one you had to be a VW 
dealer and had to sign for it, as a dealer you were responsible to return 
this to VOA when you no longer had a need for it.  A big VW friend of our's 
years ago wanted to reprint this info and was friends with one of VOA's 
biggest lawyers.  This Lawyer said that VW could not allow it due to possible 
lawsuits if the info got widely out!

Does anyone have this same info for the 1968-79ish period?  EEE&amp;B
