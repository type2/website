&gt; well, well.... this is the dilema i am having right now. i think i roached

*snip*
&gt; westerners. so is a freeway flier made for me? i have 195 15's on there now, 
&gt; but have ridden with 205/75's while getting the others painted and didnt 
&gt; notice much of an rpm difference. the tranny sh#i is too confusing for me 

I did the calculations and can find no possible way you could get 4800 rpm
with a small nut and 205/75 15 tires...

Given that you had a bug 4th (higher RPMS) and the tires are one inch
smaller than stock (a fair ammount) 4000 rpm would be 61 MPH.

With a bus 4th and 27 inch tires it would be... 68.5_at_4000

Is my math wrong?  the formula i used was dave E's formula (but i could
have misapplied it of course)

take care,

Steve
