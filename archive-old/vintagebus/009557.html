&gt; Does anyone remember a web site from a self described vw junk yard?
&gt; It had a &quot;girl with broke down bus puts in a new engine&quot; story
&gt; and a two battery &quot;how to' article. stuff like that.
&gt; I also had links to stories about bus trips to Costa Rica.
&gt; I think maybe they were shut down by VWofA's lawyers
&gt; I miss the site for it's humor and real world tips.


This was one helluva site.  I used to check it often because it had all
kinds of neat stories about the amazing home made schwimmagen that they used
to cross Lake Erie with, etc.  The URL, which is burned into my mind, was
http://www.acvwjyro_dot_com

Unfortunately, it no longer comes up and is gone.  I'm really gonna miss
that site.  It was good enough that someone should have hosted it someplace
else.  I know they were going to have to shut it down eventually because of
some legal mumbo jumbo and it looks like indeed, the lawyers possibly won
again.
