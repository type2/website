Subject: RE: [VB] Oil leak at Oil Pump cover

OK, now you got me confused. Skinny little &quot;O&quot; ring. Are we talking
about a Vanagan or a Subaru ? That little groove around the surface of
the oil pump with the two little slots in it is the designed oil pump
priming channel. The only thing that should be on the face of your oil
pump under the cover is the really thing oil pump cover gasket.

 An oil leak developed at the oil pump cover. I pulled it and the skinny
little O-ring was out of its groove and smashed. I will need to replace
it tomorrow.
