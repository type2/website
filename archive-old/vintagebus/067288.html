Subject: Split bus front panel part

i was browsing through the net, and the only place where i could find some
part needed are Schofield in England.

Can i find these part at a closer store in USA ?

(as here in the Schofield catalog)

#3 Outer front Panel (ok this one seem available everywhere)
#5 upper front panel
#6 finnishing trims
#45 Bottom nose cone


Since ive read that bus Depot and Oldvolks carry schiofield part, i wonder
why i cannot find these on their web base catalog ??

tx

mike
