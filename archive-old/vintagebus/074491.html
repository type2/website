Hello Guys    I think that everyone should do what the Fullmoonbusclub does. 
When we have a campout and raise money we split it between the type2 list, 
ffullmoonbusclub, and a local charity . This is what we have been doing at 
Naturalbus  Last year we gave about $800.00 to the Ronald Mc donald house that was 
raise by the tyed dyed motor. Later and have fun  Mark Dearing  Salem Import
