Hi Everyone,

	I recently removed my dual ICTs (which are in need of a rebuild) in favor
of a stock 34 PICT3 for the time being.  So now I have the 'ol 34/009
problems.  I've been reading up on stock distributors, and have come to the
realization that the SVDA (or even the DVDA) distributor is what would work
best for my application.  Of course, I don't own one of these. . . !!

	I do have a Bosch DVDA distributor from a 2000cc T-4 engine (VW# 070 905
205) with factory pointless, electronic ignition at my disposal though.  I
realize that this distributor has an advance curve suited for a FI engine (I
don't have the exact specs for this distributor though so it's anyone's
guess that would surely be wrong for my 34 PICT3 equipped engine so I don't
intend to just bolt it in and forget about it.  With that noted, I was
wanting to know if anyone has experience swapping the mechanical advance
parts from a SVDA (and possibly the vacuum canister too) to this distributor
body in order to be able to have the correct advance curve as well as take
advantage of the more maint-free, pointless ignition??  If anyone has some
words of wisdom in this area, I'm all ears. . .
