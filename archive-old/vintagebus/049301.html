A beautiful day for a VW show in Madera. A few listees were there, Greg Banfill, Nate, Rex from Merced, etc. The '54 RHD deluxe from Bakersfield was there,  also the red/white 21w with matching Puck. 

I parked in front of a '66 with a Dormobile top. Peeked inside and it had a Westy interior. Vince the original owner said it was the longest drive, 25 miles, it had been on in 20 years. He bought it as a hard top at the beginning of a year's tour of Europe with his wife and two kids. He told me the short version, some German friends got on the phone with the Westfailia factory and requested a pop-top. He had the factory install a Dormobile top which he says they had in stock. The bus has been redone by Vince over the last few years with new Baltic birch paneling, seals, paint, etc. He reinstalled all the large tent brackets even though he only has a small cargo door tent. He had given up  on redoing the cracked and split sinktop until Karl sold him a legless table with the correct pattern. 

Are Westies with Dor' tops common? I have pictures to post tonight. No, he won't sell, he hopes to take his grandchildren on camping trips to recreate their parent's adventures. He didn't replace a cracked passenger windshield because he has hundreds of pictures of their trip with that crack in it. His wife kept a diary of the trip. Would make a great web page or book or CD I'd bet.
