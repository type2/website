Subject:  OFF TOPIC: cost of closer 3rd and 4th gears?
Date: Mon, 3 Jul 2000 09:39:04 +1000 
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Hi All,

This is definitely off-bus-topic and I do apologise
but I'm sorta stuck.  

I have a friend who races a tube chassis buggy 
(like a rail) with post 72 IRS type 1 box. He's looking to fit a closer 
3rd and 4th gear, probably something like a 1.48 3rd and a 1.04 4th.

Each of these gears will cost US$200 dollars here when bought
through one of the 'racing' shops here in Australia.  
Does anyone know if this is comparable 
to the US price?  (I'm guessing this
has gotta be steep if Transform is selling complete rebuilt boxes 
with closer 3rd and 4th for not much more in the US).

The transmission places
I know off in the US (Rancho and Tranform) don't
appear to have any web or email contact that I can find (through
web search and checking latest mags available here in Oz).  Does
anyone know of a US transaxle supplier/builder who actually has
web presence or is email contactable?

Thanks (and sorry for the bandwidth)

RobK
