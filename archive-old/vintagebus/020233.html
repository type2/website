Be sure to come to the campout at Rich Yost's in
Yucaipa the Friday night before the OCTO show. 
(Ronnie can probably provide better directions than I
can.)  He is here in Albuquerque now picking up busses
for his collection, and told me to make sure everyone
had an invitation to Christmas Tree Island.  Remember
to bring a tree this year to replenish the dying Xmas
tree orchard.  (Find out what's legal to bring into
California.)  Come see his newly finished shop!  Rex,
even if you don't have a bus, you could motel it near
by, and follow the caravan.

Hope to see you there!

&gt; Well after some negotiations it looks like I'll be
&gt; going to OCTO and the Classic for my first time.

&gt; We'll be traveling that way the week before that
&gt; weekend from west 
&gt; texas to Cali on I-10. Anyone or anything &quot;vw&quot; along
&gt; the way? Let me 
&gt; know so we can plan to make our pitstops in those
&gt; areas.
&gt; 
&gt; Looking forward to meeting a few list members out
&gt; there.
