I do have one of the bus boats on top of my 1960 23 window walk thru. I
was only aware of one other up in Washington that was sold with the
'63(?) 23 window I saw advertised in Hot VWs about 7 years ago.
Are there really any more that can actually be accounted for?
I bought mine at the Classic many years ago from a guy who brought it in
from Arizona. Are there more there?
It gets more attention at my shop than the Hebmuller.
Is there much interest in them? Maybe I can reproduce them.
