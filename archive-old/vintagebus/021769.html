Hi Joe,
Hmmm, those colors do not sound correct.  Possibly they have changed due to 
time and exposure to the oily engine compartment which also tends to harden 
to the cracking point the colored insulation.  You might try cutting off a 
little off the end of the black plastic cover of these wires and see if the 
wire colors where they have been protected are more correct.   Eric&amp;Barb
PS If you are going to dump the FI stuff we coulkd use it!  Thanks, EEE&amp;B
