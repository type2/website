&gt; But its basically made me untrustfull of the ENTIRE state of utah!

When I first read this I wondered if it was fair to put the whole state
in a bad light because of one person's actions. I know that there are
some shady characters here in Oregon, and I would hate to be labeled as
a person not to deal with because I live in the same state.:)

On the other hand, has anyone heard from Will Wood from Utah in the last
two years? He took me for a very nice distributor. We were trading my
nice 019 dizzy for a 40hp big-diameter distributor ( a trade already
heavily favored in his direction), well I sent him the 019 and soon
after that disappeared from the list and never returned my mail. I even
put him on my club's newsletter mailing list for a year, just to remind
him in a left-handed way that I still was waiting for the distributor,
to remind him I was alive. His wife did send me a note once that he was
out of the state, and would send me my distributor soon. That was more
than two years ago. So much for Utahns. :)
And lets not even talk about the Salt Lake City Olympics. :)

( Please, I can imagine the flames I will get. I am just teasing!)
