new bus looks great...i have a roof rack that looks the same as
yours(althought difficult to see the entire thing in your pictures)...the PO
told me it was original, but  my bus is a '65 not '62...I have no idea...i had
mine metalized as it was rather rusty, although only surface rust. I also put
some wood slats up there, and a mount for bicycle...unfortunately I didn't
seal the wood and now it is all warped....I need to replace it...but there are
a million things I need to do...someday
