Subject: Gonna get the 23-window deluxe
Mime-Version: 1.0

Well, I called the guy with the 23 window walk-thru deluxe back today &amp;
told him I was planning on getting it. He said it was mine unless I said
otherwise. So while getting the $$$ together I'm gonna try &amp; get a plan
together for getting it home. It's about 150 miles away &amp; has no transaxle.
So I'm either gonna have to find another one or manufacture some temporary
contraption to get it home. If anyone has a line on anything in the central
&amp; west texas area, let me know. Thanks for all the responses with
information from my original post. And if anyone has any other suggestions,
please feel free to send them my way. This is what I always wanted. Even
though it's not actually mine yet, I'm very excited. 

Thanks
