Hey All,

Thanks again for all the rgb/trailing arm bolt info!  I was wondering if 
anyone had one or two bus rims laying around near upstate SC.  I could buy 
or trade 14in bus rims.  I've been running 15in beetle rims and scored a 
pair of 15in bus and a pair of 14in bus rims and am jonesin to get a set of 
15s!  Help me get some hubcaps on my bus!  He's been cruising for over a 
year on 66-7 only clipless beetle rims that won't take dome caps to clear my 
axles!

Thanks,

Eric
