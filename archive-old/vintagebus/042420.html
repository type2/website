&gt; Hi Steve,
&gt; Thanks, but the thing is that this two (?) year only bench seat can be 
&gt; installed in any bench seat bus down to 1955!  We know of a fellow up this 
&gt; way with a 57 that has one in his.

It could really be installed in any bus, but if you look closer, you will
see that the body brackets have 3 holes instead of the standard one hole
found on 60 down busses.  To install this two year only seat properly you
would need to cut out these 3-hole brakets and weld them into an earlier
bus.  So, if my 61 didnt come with this seat it came with one just like it
as the paint is original near these 3 hole brackets!

Also, if you look close at the picture you can see a curved pipe behind
the seat welded to the base that the bakrest rests against.

Another interesting thing... the bumpers that pad between the seat frame
and seat pedestal are oblong instead of round... about this shape and
size:
