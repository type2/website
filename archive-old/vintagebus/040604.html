 You want the truth?  You can't handle the truth.  NO truth handler you.  I
scorn your truth handling abilities!  Sorry, the truth is we all suck.  Evil
backbiters.  Steal other people stuff all the time.    Install flat spots in
009 distributors.  (I have the secret  factory literature that tells how to
do this- with pictures)  Post erroneous M-code meanings.    Go on and on and
on about our boring trips to the grocery store and back in some crusty old
bus.       We are only cool because old buses have wimpy heat.  In fact this
moring I'm freezing.  Did you think this list was about peace, love and
understanding?    Well, the sixties are over. . .  the drugs wore off...
and
 I have a middle seat to sell you.
