Subject: Re: VIN Woes

After reading all the stories I realize how lucky I was.  The PO of my
Bus was a lady at work.  Her husband was in the oil business here in
Tulsa and got transferred to Houston, so they moved down there and she
worked from home.  She was back in Tulsa for a meeting and we happened
to talk VWs and she mentioned wanting to sell her Bus.  This was only
about a year since they had moved to Houston, and the Bus didn't run
reliably, so they hadn't bothered getting a Texas title or tags.  I
drove down to Houston to do business and when she sold it to me she
signed the back of the Oklahoma title.  I trailered it home, signed
the title, took the title to the tag agency, and got it put in my name -
no fuss.  I think they looked at the 7-digit VIN for a moment, then
looked at the year and figured out it was cool.  They gave me new
plates and the new, clear title in my name came in the mail a few
days later.

I think Ronnie has a good track on being nice to the folks at the
DMV / MVD / tag agency / whatever your state calls it.  Some folks
are going to be jerks no matter what, but you can influence them
some.  Have all the papers you've got in hand, even if you think
you might not need them all.  Use their Web site, or call a different
DMV office or the one at the state capital, to find out what kind of
papers you need, so you can show up with the right stuff.  Go in
during the second or third week of the month, first thing in the
morning if you can, when they're not very busy.  Dress respectably
and smile a lot.  IMHO doing it like this makes it easier to get
what you need.
