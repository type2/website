Hi Rennie,
This is only a problem with those who shift into the higher gears at way too 
low of MPH and thusly result in way too low of engine RPM.  This apparently 
is a common occurance with the fifth gear tranny with drivers who do not 
realise what they are doing.  Which is another reason for taching your VW to 
make sure where the RPMs are!   Eric&amp;Barb
