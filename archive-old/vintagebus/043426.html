&gt;I think the dynamo died last week, sypmtoms were there, bus ran fine but
&gt;then lights started to dim/get bright with revs, and then once home there
&gt;was zilch when it was stopped and restarted.

Sounds more like a dead regulator.  The fact that the lights dimmed
and brightened with engine revs indicates that the generator was
still putting out some current, but was not being properly controlled
by the regulator.
 
&gt;So, I renewed some dodgy looking spade connectors between the dynamo and the
&gt;regulator(is that what it's called?) on the firewall, and I was going to
&gt;check the output of this (should be around a 12V DC out right?) to confirm
&gt;where the problem was lying - what is the input to this regulator? 12V AC?

Nope.  All of the rectification (AC-&gt;DC) is done inside the generator,
by the brushes and commutator (that thing with all the copper strips that
the brushes ride on).  The regulator switches the field coil inside
the generator on and off at varying rates to regulate the voltage the
generator puts out.  You can check that it is well-grounded to the
firewall and that the connections to it are in good shape (some of
which you have already done).  Also check that the wires bolted onto
the starter are clean and tight - but disconnect the battery negative
cable before fooling around with these!

&gt;Anyhow, had my SO in the cab on starting duty with newly charged battery,
&gt;and she turned on the electrics, got red light, got solenoid click, but
&gt;then as soon as she tried to start it, there was another click up front
&gt;and nothing.

If your regulator is out, your battery may not have been getting charged
very well.  Try turning on the headlights...are they nice and bright or
dim?  If dim, charging the battery will probably help.  If they are
bright, but the starter still doesn't work, you might have trouble in
the starter or ignition switch.  The Idiot manual has a good procedure.

Good luck!
