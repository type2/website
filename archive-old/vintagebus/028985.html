While I strongly oppose this proposed bill and all pre 75 vehicles are and
would be exempt, here is the really scary part :

&quot;(i) The department determines through remote sensing activities or
other means that there is a substantial probability that the vehicle
has a tampered emission control system or would fail for other cause
a smog check test as specified in Section 44012.&quot;


Those of you in Southern Ca ever remember those little red trucks and no window
little trailers parked at the top of various on ramps a year or so ago??
&quot;Remote sensing&quot;  Just like the photo tickets that are used in intersections
currently.  But this snaps a photo of your license plate when you power past a
sniffer and are out of the &quot;limits&quot; the State has set.

Think that's bad, do a little research on OBDII and OBDIII in newer cars.  The
technology is here to remote sense and monitor a car from a distance.
Polluting too much, speeding, didn't pay your car payment.  You could be fined,
slowed down/stopped or your car disabled all without any human intervention.
While none of this is in actual practice currently, the architecture is being
built in to today's vehicles.

Good thing we drive 30+ year old technology....now if we could just keep the
&quot;man&quot; off our backs ;-)

Spread the word.

&gt; If you live in California please take the time to check out the above link.
&gt; It provides updates on legislation that will be used to make it harder to
&gt; keep our classics on the road.
&gt;
&gt; NO ON SB1811!!!! - This law will overturn SB42, if this law passes you will
&gt; have to start sending your splitties (and some loafs) to the smog station
&gt;
&gt; If you don't live in California, please have your friends and relatives who
&gt; do cast a vote to help us out. Also keep in mind that other states often use
&gt; California as a model for their smog laws.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
