Subject: Redux rebuild questions
Message-Id: &lt;37401B60.EB0F6EBB_at_crosskeys_dot_com&gt;

Its finally time to rebuild one of my redux boxes.  Its long overdue.

I've torn most of it apart, and I'm at the stage where I have to
remove the plug on the back of the box.

Bentley says to wield a nut on the plug, but I don't have any wielding
gear.
Is there any other way to do this?  Would propane be enough
heat to braze the nut on sufficiently (doubt it)?

How about glue (bad joke)?

If anyone has any advice, I could use it.

Thanks,
...Markus (and Tardis)
