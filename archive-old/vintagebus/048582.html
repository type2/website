Subject: Re: [VB] Leaking Push Rod Tube

Simple and better than original solution:  spring loaded push rod tubes.
These seal better than the ones that came on your engine.  You just pull
the rocker arm off and the push rod of the leaking tube.  Take some tin
snips and cut out the old tube.  Put some aviation Permatex on the new
seals, both inside and out, pull the spring back and install.

Ronnie at old volks home should have these.


&gt;I have developed an annoying leak in one of my pushrod tubes.
&gt;Does anyone have a repair for this short of pulling the engine and replacing
&gt;the seals?
&gt;The engine is running great and there's only a couple of months left in the
&gt;camping season, I'd really like to avoid breaking everything down just now.
&gt;TIA
