Subject: Re:westy question

I got a closer look at that 74 westy. The body is not as nice as I
thought, still no rust holes, but quite a bit of bondo. Nothing looks
too deep but there is still a lot. The nice thing is that most of it is
on the sliding door. It also turns out that the distributor is missing,
but the carbs look rebuilt pretty recently. The hoses for the ac are
gone and the compressor is probably shot. Whatever was behind the driver
and passenger seats is missing. Overall, closeup, in daylight it is
worse than I thought , but that is usually how it goes. Either way ,
money is getting kind of tight and I don't think my wife ( who was not
very impressed  with the van, even though she loves the one we have)
really wants to drop money on a non-running vehicle right now. I have to
admit it is tough to spend money on another project when our current bus
needs as much attention. I still hate to let it go when it is onlt $350.
I will probably know whether or not I am going to be able to afford this
project within the next week or so, if any one else in the Dallas area
is interested let me know.
