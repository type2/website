Subject: Type 3 Shifter Boot

Hey everybody:

That notchback message from NQ got me thinking. Does anybody know if the 
early type 3 shifter boot is being reproduced?

My baja has a type 3 shifter and the boot is in bad shape. I had a perfect 
one that I picked up at a VW show for 50 cents. Of coarse, it was in my 
garage when it burned down 4 months ago.
