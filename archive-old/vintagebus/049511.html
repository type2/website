I have a set of NOS Kolbenschmidt (sp?) 1600 pistons; I'd use them in my
rebuild,but they seem to be made .40&quot; over.
What situation would I use these in? I really don't see the point in boring
a cylinder oversize, so maybe someone can enlighten me.
Also, is there anything preventing me from using them in a plain jane
1600cc 86.5 cylinder?
