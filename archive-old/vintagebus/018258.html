Subject: rear corner and dogleg replacement parts?
Date: Thu, 02 Nov 2000 22:29:14 -0700
Sender: dworkin_at_village_dot_org


So the body shop that's dealing with my '60 kombi says that they can't
find a source of replacement panels for the rear corners or the
doglegs.  I was under the impression that these were readily
available.  Is it that you can only get them for later years, or do
these guys just not know who to call?  Any suggestions on where to go
looking?

The body shop is a subcontractor of a VW restorer in the area that
mostly does beetles.  I suspect they'd be a source of regular orders
for sheet metal and other esoteric parts for someone if I gave them a
good lead or two.  I know there are various dealers on the list, but I
don't know if any of them do the body panels all that much, as opposed
to the more-normal wear items....

Thanks.
