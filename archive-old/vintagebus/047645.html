&gt;For lack of a better word, I have noticed that a lot of VW engines in good
&gt;running order have a kind &quot; chirping &quot; sound to them.  Does anyone know what

THat sound is called &quot;fweem&quot; and is a function of the exhaust pea-shooters
- - - - -
ya- FWEEM !!!!!

bug mufflers make a more chirpy noise than the bus ones- .  The bug ones have
the two tailpipes coming straight out, and the bus ones have one tailpipes
going off to the side.   

And each individual motor has it's own particular sound.  Even dogs can tell.
And a 36hp sounds different than a 40hp sounds different than a 1600 sounds
different from a pancake.   So one could hear a VW drive by and know what
motor it had, are maybe even who it was if you were familiar with that
person's vehicle.    And that sounds hould be embedded in your brain, or your
spinal cord, which reaches to your tailbone, and you feel the vibrations of
the VW through your seat as you drive it and if it skips or changes you feel
it in you spine, alerting you to it's unease, and often making you feel uneasy
yourself.   But the strong sure VW motor sound and feel soothes you, bathing
and massaging you in it's energy, until you have become almost one with it.
