The Big Kansas City MoKan Trip - Part 3
================================

 The next morning I didn't get up until 8:00 or so.  We were all just so
worn out from the late night and the drive from the night before so we
traded an early start for sleep and I for one didn't regret it.

 Before leaving, we raised up Rob's adjustable front end to help alleviate
some handling problems.  With radios in hand, we headed for KC using Dan
Kinsey's directions.  We had a nice time chatting with each other.  I led
because I was the slow one, then Dan in his red CRX, and Rob behind him.
Oil temps were kosher on the way down and with Justin riding shotgun once
again, we had no problem getting on our proper turnoff.  Shortly thereafter
was a neat old tunnel so I had to honk the horn.  The echo was kind of eerie
and awesome at the same time!  We also spied a 21 window in a fenced in auto
shop yard and when we started seeing some dubs, we knew we were close.
Using Dan Buser's fiance Wendy's directions to home us in, we found the
square!  The first guy I saw I didn't know.  He was a big guy in a straw hat
and he walked up to my open window and said, &quot;Hello Erin!&quot;  I later found
out this to be Rick Taylor.  It's weird when people come up to you and know
who you are based upon your web page and verbal description and you can't
place them.  I guess that is sort of what it's like to be a celebrity of
sorts.  As I crept along, I was asked if I was entering the show.  I
declined but later wished that I would have just to add a rough driver bus
to the lot.  If there was a worst of show award, I would have grabbed it for
sure!

 We headed for the parking lot and with tourist loot in tow, we set out for
the show.  Dan Kinsey, my host for the week, was easy to spot with his
shorts, dove blue Binz double cab, and lot of parts for sale.  I really
enjoy getting to know these bus guys because if you need a place to sit or
hang out in the shade, they'll let you sit in their rides.  How can you get
any better than sitting in a Binz slinging the breeze with an old VW buddy?
:-)

 There were not as many entries in the show as there had been in the past
but nevertheless, the quality was there.  The 49 Heb from Trenton was there
courtesy of its new owner.  The previous owner had let me touch it, sit in
it, fiddle with the knobs, etc. but this time, I got the feeling the Heb was
in the Do Not Touch class.  I spent a little bit telling people the story
behind the car.  It was in the same family since it's import back in the
late 40's early 50's and was only recently sold.  I guess good ol' Art would
have rather had the money and I can't blame him.

 I just saw lots and lots of assorted cool rides.  There was a guy named
Gary Meyer I believe who drives a 55 oval in somewhat rough shape but it's
his daily driver in the summer.  He's done a lot of work to the bug but it
still has no interior to speak of (doors are of a heavy guage steel - WOW!)
but the original engine is in it and he just drives and drives it.  He's a
humble guy and I really enjoyed chatting with him.  The other car was a MINT
62 beetle imported from Germany a few years ago.  I forget the owner's names
but this bug caught my eye and I just had a gut feeling that I needed to
visit with the owners.  The beetle was purchased new by a chemical company
in Germany and a year later, a family friend bought it.  Time went on and
the beetle was drivin occasionally but always kept garaged.  Years later,
the widow sold it to this couple.  Everything is original.  Matter of fact,
the guy told me that when it reached port in Houston, he rolled it out, did
some brake work, put in new oil, and with the 15 year old gas still in it,
fired it up and drove it to Dallas to have it shipped to the KCMO area.  The
car is a light greenish color and had a tiny Brandenburg Gate (sp?) emblem
on the speaker grill and a manual mileage counter with thick German writing
on it.  The car had spent the previous 15 years in a garage undriven there
in Germany and with barely anything over 30,000km and the tires still
holding air, was wheeled out and prepped for the trip over here.  Absolutely
awesome!!!

 I looked around at the swaps but didn't find anything other than a  $7 pair
of red urethane swingaxle boots.  Time was getting away from us the the dark
clouds were rolling in so Dan Buser and Wendy hopped in the bus with me, Rob
and Justin hopped in their bug, and with Dan Kinsey leading in da Binz, he
lead us to a good ol' burger joint.  Soon after we went in, the rain came
pouring down necessitating that Dan shut his Safari's and me my side
popouts.  I found out a new use for Safaris.  Dan could peek out and come up
to about an inch or so away from my rear bumper so we had 2 buses parked
real close together with Rob's bug trailing the pack.  I got a picture of it
too!  We had a good ol' time chatting dubs, eating, slobbering over a VW
Classics mag (Thanks to Rob the walking library!) :-), and watching the rain
come pouring down, wondering if the sandrail crowd, ragtop/sunroof crowd,
and the Heb guy got wet or if their cars did.

 Dan led the way back to the parking lot and Dan and Wendy snagged their
rides.  One the way back to the Kinsey bus ranch, Dan gave us an informative
tour via the FRS radios of some outstanding landmarkes in the area.  That
was really cool.  Once we arrived, we had to pile in the Binz for one of Dan
Kinsey's famous cruises.  I've had the pleasure of cruising in the front
seat of the Binz so I relinquished the position to Rob Laffoon.  Dan Buser
took a picture of Rob up there with the Safari window open.  The picture
sums it all up.  I'll be posting some pix on the website later on so keep
this in mind when you're looking through the pix.  Rob was like I was -
beside himself in absolute VDub bliss.  I've gotta get me some Safaris - I
can't say &quot;No&quot; any longer. :-)

 The evening was spent talking dub, watching TV, looking at Dan's VW toy
collection, rare literature that he owns, pictures, his awesome Abbleby
camper, parts 54 SC, the Eriba PUCK, and the plethora of rare parts and
accessories that abound in and hang from the rafters in his garage.

Dan Buser and Wendy had to take off so we bid them farewell and Dan Kinsey
and family kindly hosted Rob and Justin for the night.  We all slept good
until I riled up the family watch dogs in their protective cages the next
morning at about 7:00 and scared the hell out of myself and Rob.  Rob fired
up Dan's Jetta so I could get out the driveway so I could go visit a good
friend (the little blonde gal) in Warrensburg, MO.  That was a very
intersting trip that ended up costing me a whole day.  I regretted that it
took me away from helping Dan but it was time that I consider well spent
with my friend Melisa.  This part of the trip is a whole 'nother story that
doesn't pertain the list per se so I'll leave it out.  It's not what you
think but it's off topic.

 I rolled in that night at Dan's sometime after 7:00.  It rained on the way
home and I about plowed into an old gal that pulled out in front of me.  I
must have done a good job on the brakes because they worked well!  Upon
arrival, I apologized to Dan for not being back sooner due to the
circumstances and he was all kosher about it.  Being the great guy he is, he
was more concerned about if I broke down or not due to a cutoff cell phone
message I left for him on his machine.  The next morning was when I actually
got to start work on the Binz.  We'll save that for the next post...
