Subject: Auction Reports,BBB, where are the Deluxes?
To: Vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Well, it's been an interesting weekend at the auto auctions in Scottsdale. 
All of you guys that are buying up Deluxe buses, don't get in too deep.
The 23 window deluxe, formerly owned by David O., which has been mentioned on 
the list, had a great deal of eye appeal, bottomed out. The selling price was 
far below expectations. By far the nicest bus on the grounds at BJ, despite 
the few areas that needed a bit more TLC to perfect that 61. 
As mentioned last week, a custom 58 23 window, sold for only $14,500, a real 
hit on the pocket book of that owner.
There were several others at BJ, including a 67 21 window, which runs Sunday, 
that are, for a lack of better description, ROACHES. The 21 window, most 
likely has had the roof clip added, terrible rust repair (front, rear floor 
and jackpoints with fiberglass) lack of belly pans, painted Peach, velour 
interior and carpet everywhere. The high points of the 21, a trip speedo, 
vent trim and an ambulance fan. What a waste of good,hard to find parts. 
We'll let you know how the bus fares Sunday night.

Why the drop on prices in just one short year???

Each of the buses for sale had been bought by car collectors when the news 
broke of buses selling for over $20,000. They paid the typical 
Japanese/Pomona price, took the car home than realized it was no where near 
the quality of restoration of their 356 Porsche, Jaguar, or 50's Chev. In 
other words, they got BURNED.

You burn these guys only once and they never come back to the Volkswagen 
market. We are very disappointed with this years results, relating VW buses. 
The market as a whole saw incredible gains on certain muscle cars, perfectly 
restored 50's America cars and exotics. 

So much for the over priced base/builder Deluxe buses.
