Have seen a poster of many early panel van with logos, and many of the 
barndoors had chromed bumpers and the 53 and earlier panels the trim on the 
rear corners.  I believe it was available to get chromed bumpers, but only 
cause of hearsay.   Hey if you paid someone they would chrome it.  Though it 
may be tacky. &lt;


Speaking of trim on the rear corners, my '52 Standard has these.  The 
previous owner of my bus said they we're on the bus when he bought it in the 
late 60's.  This is a euro spec bus, so I wonder if that has anything to do 
with it.  Does anyone else know of any '53 and back barndoor standards, 
kombis, or single cabs with rear corner trim pieces?
