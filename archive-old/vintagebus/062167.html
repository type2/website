Subject: Re: [VB] Another burnt VW bus!

Seeing this reminded me of a question I have been meaning to ask for a while
so I might as well ask now whilst I think of it.
When I got my bus I pulled the engine to change the clutch and did the fuel
lines at the same time - good job I did so as when I disturbed the engine
the fuel starting pouring out of the bad lines!
My question is about the fuel line itself - from my tank I have a short
section of metal pipe (approx 1 inch).  I then have a rubber fuel line
running above the gearbox tied to the firewall(below the tank) which then
comes over the top of the front tin to the fuel pump.
My friend just got a bus, so I went to change his lines for him, and he has
a metal pipe that comes from the tank through the front tin(through a
grommet) so the only the only flexible fuel hose is a short length in the
engine bay.

I know my bus is wrong, but what should I do to make sure my fuel lines are
safe?  I am not bothered by originality just want my bus to be safe.

Thanks
Paul
