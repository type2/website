&gt; Inside it seems pretty good and there was no evidence of further rust inside

Hi Paul,
Take a small inspection mirror and take a good look of the interior just 
inside the opening you carved into it.  If there is rust you will have to 
figure out how to get it out of there and a sandblaster will probably not be 
able to spray almost backwards towards the operator to get the rust out.  
Phosphoric could easily be painted in there and thusly no sand needing to be 
cleaned out of there.  We wonder about installing a threaded plug and 
treating the interior area with either tranny gear oil or one of the 
waxy/oily undercoating to help prevent the spread of rust if moisture does 
get in there.
