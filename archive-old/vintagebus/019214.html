The old If then else statement...

*IF* 
this thread is true 
*THEN* 
my butt is smoking thinking that he probably sold the
MF (mighty fine) thing in a short time.

*ELSE* 
Perhaps I should have parted out the PITA
barnambulator earlier than I did. And people wonder
why I am 95% of the way out of the VW scene any
more...

*WHILE*
Buses being refered to on a regular basis as expensive
and whacked sales like this leave me nearly
speechless. Back to the lurk, scan and delete &quot;while
loop&quot; routine...
