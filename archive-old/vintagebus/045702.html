&lt;&lt; Hello, I've got a leaky rear axle and was going to replace the seal today. 
There is no play in the wheel, but definitely a balsy rumble when I spin it. 
So I figure I'll replace the bearing too.&gt;&gt;
Hi Wilder,
There are four bearings in each reduction box not just one.  Even if there is 
only one bad bearing it is best to just replace all four at once especially 
if you plan to do long distance trips with your bus.  If you do reuse the 
used bearing/s now or later.  You have to take the time and inspect all the 
bearings you think might be usable inside thier inner and outer races for any 
imperfections.  Even a slight mar only about a pin tip size is a sign the 
bearing is on it's way out.
You really need to buy a Bentley reprint of the VW bus shop manual!
 
&lt;&lt;My question is: should I buy a bearing puller or just try prying the thing 
out? I'd like to get it done tomorrow and don't want to spend a lot of time 
getting it out. Are there different types of pullers? How would I know which 
puller to buy? Do I get it at the FLAPS or the VW parts store?  &gt;&gt;
 We have been able to remove either type of reduction bearings with hammer, 
chisel(Used as a wedge.), and other hand tools without the use of a puller.
