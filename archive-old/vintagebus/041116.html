Good day buslist!
(You don't seem dead to me.)
I just got through replacing kingpins, linkpins, swing lever pin,
tie-rod ends, etc. I measured the trailing arm offsets and shimmed
appropriately. Set the toe-in to 1/8&quot;. Bus steers and handles great
with no more wandering off across the road on its own. The steering
wheel is a hair crooked (maybe 10-15 degrees), but I hear I can fix
that with a little twist of the draglink.
So do I now need to take my bus in for a professional alignment, or
have I already done what needs to be done? Are their other alignment
checks and adjustments I can do myself?
Thanks,
Joel
