65 is one year only.   3/55 through 64 use the separate kind, 65 is the first 
year of the annoying big bracket thing the wiper assembly goes on, and has 
auto parking and one speed motor.

66 and 67 use the same frame as each other, which is DIFFERENT from the 65 
one. And the actual shafts are different too from 65 to the 66/67 kind.  the 
only difference between 66 and 67 is it is 6V or 12V

I heard they reproed the 66/67 shafts, but not the 65 kind because they hate 
'65 bus drivers, or maybe it is just that the other kind has a larger market.

I had to go through this when I got my 65 westy, one shaft was broken, or was 
it both?  Anyway while it is out, do grease up all the moving parts in the 
assembly, and regrease the motor (mine squeaked real loud at first, but with 
grease-now very quiet) and check the little white plastic doohickeys at the 
linkage joints cause if there is slop there it will come out in the wiper 
action. 

such a hassle to remove this ones.  Anyone retrofit an earlier wiper motor in 
a 65-67?

&lt;&lt; Well I was going to suggest BFY, since I just got wiper shafts from them 
for my '67, but then I checked the catalog and they carry all years '55 and 
up...except '65. I wonder why....? What's so odd about the '65 wiper system?

 &gt; 
 &gt; Aloha all,
 &gt; 
 &gt; This is a true need--I've come out from lurking to ask if anyone has one
 &gt; (OK two if there is that many, though only one is broken at this
 &gt; point...) wiper shaft for my '65 bus?  It appears that only a '65 fits a
 &gt; '65, and have not found it from Wolfburg West or West Coast Metric.  I
 &gt; would truly appreciate the help!
