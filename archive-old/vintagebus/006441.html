&gt;1. Which years was the bottom of the rear bench seat &quot;flat&quot;, i.e. the lower
tube frame is completely flat, no bends or anything, except at the corners?
This in contrast to the front bench seat bottom where the front of the frame
bends downward to meet the body.



Rosie ('63) has the drop front seat


&gt;
&gt;2. How does the rear seat bottom attach?  Is it the same as the front bench
seat bottom with the 2 &quot;arms&quot; that extend into brackets at the rear of each
side?


Yep.
