I have a couple of questions for you know-all-do-all gurus out there. :-)

First off, I need to get a gas tank with a sending unit for my 66 bus.  If I
get a baywindow tank, I'm going to have to modify the filler neck I've been
told.  Can I simply cut the next off of my old tank or on the bay window
tank and use a piece of rubber tubing (like on the bugs) to hold the filler
tubes together where they need to be?

Next is a wiring question:  Back by the starter, I have an ignition wire
which I think presses onto the electrical male spade connector found on the
relay (is this correct?)  Then there is stud with a nut on it on the back of
the relay/bendix.  I have a battery cable with a round connector and then a
red/black striped wire and solid red wire leading to another round ring
connector.  Do both of these bolt onto the relay on the starter?

I guess that's it for now.  My eyes are tired and shutting so thanks for
reading...
