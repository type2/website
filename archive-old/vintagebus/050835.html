Subject: Ellis- coming out Party...

DON'T be ridiculous, pregnant wife and a two year old... &lt;as if!&gt;

After over twenty years of living a lie, I... um I... well I~ I can not go on
with the Aircooled charade any longer!!!!
Well OK, it's not like I have to hide it or anything. People will talk and call
me names and wonder what I have been up to all of these years. I may lose
friends. I may even lose my job and have to attend a 'spethial' church on
Sunday, but I am OUT and I am proud I will wave the flag high and sthrut my
sthuff with pride! Flannel shirts, wide men's leather writhst watch bands,
hiking boots and if necessary act BUTCH at Denny's! (oh my goodness) I know
that there are those of you who will support my cause and take up the &quot;staff&quot;
that I carry ahead of me. I, um.... I, ah... &lt;blush&gt; went WATERCOOLED this
week.
OK, I feel *so* ASHAMED I feel so humiliated. I feel dirty to the point at
which
repetitive showering with dry bars of LAVA soap will not make it go away!!!!
&lt;hissy fit&gt; It's easy to blame it all on that aggressive choir instructor at my
Catholic Parish in my youth but NO! Gosh darn it! IT'S MY DECISION and I am
standing by it!!!!
This week I chose to sign my name to documents which lock me into a monthly
BUTT RAPE for a mint condition 1997, one owner, Eurovan Winnebago Camper with
(total embarrassment and shame) an AUTOMATIC and AIR CONDITIONING. I even admit
to seeking it out and accepting an interest rate above that of a regular,
normal, well-adjusted ~ passenger car~. &lt;hysterical crying&gt;...
I feel like such of a jail house BITCH! I mean getting in on the LOW END of the
wholesale value of a such of a chick bus. Oh slap my writhst, it isn't even
called a bus &lt;more emotional melting&gt; it's, it's, it's referred to as a... as
a... VAN!!!!!!! &lt;total melt down&gt;
I really tried to go Synchro Westy- I really did! The fear of WET heads and
cooling PIPES, Expensive and invasive procedures to put me in gear and
intermittant electrically charged DEATH QUIVERS made me go astray. I could have
paid the same or more for AWD Westies with 150,000+ miles on them with no
guarantees but NO! I had to PUSS out and rely on the apron strings of Momma
Volkswagen and SUCK up the remaining extended warranty. Diva? oh, get over it!
Now, that was SO last year!!!! Ooooooooh! Like haven't you heard? Mariah is
dead, darhling! &lt;break out the Shiva shiver and ice.&gt; (chill)
Gathering myself back together and recomposing myself, &lt;thanks for the Kleenex,
does it have lotion?&gt; I can defend myself and say that it has 63,400 miles on
it, drives like a dominatrix is on it's ASS,has a WHIPPING sound system, an
ALARMING security system and is so VIRGIN that you'd expect the odometer to
read 10,000 miles. The wife found it hiding in the spethial classifieds and
encouraged me to make the call. OK! OK! I HOOKED UP with the retired Motorola
Engineer who was so ANAL about his van that he had indoor-outdoor carpeting
squares in his driveway under each tire. &lt;true sthatement&gt;. I even made the
previous owners cry at time at which I PAID FOR IT!
They were so broke-up that they asked me to hang back while they drove away-
claiming that it was the best for both of us... &lt;whimper, true, true...&gt;.
I am appologizing for this public confession, but I had to get it off of my
chest. (No, no, talk to the hand) I appologize to everyone to whom I had ever
exposed to aircooled knowledge and lead astray. I ask for your forgiveness and
admit that I am powerless. I get all my strength from a higher power (VR6).
&lt;two snaps up&gt; This was such of a PUSS deal that I had to step up and admit my
transgressions.
Hello, my name is Jim, I am a Vanaholic. Jerry Spa-ringer, here I come baby!
