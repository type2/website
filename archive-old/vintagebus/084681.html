Subject: Re: [VB] Size of 58 Cab vs. later split windows...

&gt; Would anyone know if the cab section or seat set up is any larger or
&gt; smaller than that of a later years split bus? Is it an issue of bench seat
&gt; versus walk-thru?

 I believe the bench seats in at least 60 &amp; earlier are closer to the
steering wheel than later.  I know that is the case between my 63 DC &amp; a 60
DC in any event. (seems to be about 2&quot; closer?)

Clara, help?


&gt; I was wondering cause I just drove a 58 panel w/ benchseat and I had a
&gt; tough time driving comfortable as compared to my 67 walk-thru? I'm 6'2&quot; so
&gt; it is kind of an issue if I were to get this older bus.... Everything else
&gt; sure seems cool though! Thanks! JD
