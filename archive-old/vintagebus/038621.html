Subject: front window frame door seals

i am putting in new seals in my front doors. I am on the window frames and
am a little perplexed as to how the seals around the vent windows go in. I
have heard that these are a bastard, so if somebody has done this, i would
love to hear what you have to say. although, i do enjoy driving around with
no front windows, my dormobile top doesn't really like it (it flew open on
my the other day at 30 mph. minor injuries to fragile roof vents. ouch).
i've since bungeed the top down, so no worries there, but i do think it's
going to rain soon with this &quot;cold&quot; fall air we've been getting. thanks.
