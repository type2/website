Find a local vw hobbyist that happens to be a crane operator/mechanic...
get that puppy fired up and extract your treasure, drop it right on a
flatbed :)

Buy the saviour a nice meal... maybe give him an NOS goody or two :)

OR

advertise in the local paper... say that a creane operator/mechanic is
needed for a weekend gig... if successful he can get $500 for one days
work, if iunsuccessful he gets zip... someone woudl call and be all over
it.

take care,

Steve
