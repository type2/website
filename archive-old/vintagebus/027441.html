Subject: ?? camper question

Hi listies,

Do any of the westie or camper knowledgable list members know if there
was a westy/camper made where they didn't change the windows from
pop-outs to the three or four panes or the crank out early sundial
kind.  I'm going to look at one today and I thought they all came with
the windows that crank out, but this one has regular pop-outs.

Thanks,
Aaron
