How easy was installing the adjusters ? on the beetle you have to cut the 
upper and lower tubes of the beam and weld the adjusters , you have to 
uninstall the torsion springs also, this was pain , is it the same way with 
69 bus beam ??
I have seen on the parts cataloge and the adjusters for 69 bus look like so 
called &quot;avis adjusters&quot; for beetle , are they installed in a different way ? 
Is there a web page explaning the job , or did U take any pictures of it ?

Thanks ..

&gt; &gt;, I have welded adjusters to my bug and it was
&gt; &gt; painfull , dont want to make it to my bus , is there a easierway to do 
&gt;it
&gt; &gt; than welding adjusters for bus-balljoint
&gt;
&gt;Pain?  I did this with the '69 beam that I put on my '60 DC.  With the beam
&gt;out on the ground, it was VERY easy.  I imagine that if the beam is
&gt;installed, it would  be a PIA.  At this point, the adjusters are most 
&gt;likely
&gt;your best option.
