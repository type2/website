Hi Scott&amp;Barb,
Build special tool VW 647 as seen in section K-3, page 2, or install a 
reserve switch and just switch it to off position.  The latter has three 
advantages:
1.  You have a gallon reserve amount of gas in the tank if run in normal 
postion.  no pouring needed!  For post-1961 VW just slide under passenger 
side and flip the switch.
2.  VW thieves will only have about two minutes before the VW dies in the 
street when you leave it in the off position.  This tends to make them panic 
and leave your VW, because a stalled in traffic VW attracts too much 
attention.
3.  No fuel spill when replacing all flex fuel lines.
