Two things to remember when dealing with salvage yards:

1) I'd rather have someone cutting up a bus that *may* be restored vs.
having the bus go to the crusher, and

2) While I would like to think all people should be able to do what they
want and not have to worry about income, most of us have to put food on the
table at the end of a day.

Don't be so hard on wayout salvage, 'cause they do offer a service to the
air-cooled community.

I know about this place! Try to get as many buses away from this guy as
possible, he will take a perfectly rebuildable bus and chop it up to sell
the parts. Save buses don't destroy them! This guy is in it for the money,
don't let him fool you he is not in it for the love of Volkswagens.
