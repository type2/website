Subject: getting my &quot;new&quot; bus home

Some of you might remember when last fall I was going to bring home a 65 Bus
that I bought in Oklahoma City......... well, I'm finally going to pick it
up this weekend... long story, don't even ask why it took me seven months to
convince the guy to sell it to me (after two price hikes)...... I'm leaving
Chicago tomorrow and I shall make it to OKC sometime around midnight on
Saturday and then early Sunday morning I'm going to Midwest City to pick it
up. I want to make it back and forth as fast as possible but in case of any
problems I might give someone a holler..... (AIRS list in my pocket).
Anyway, my cell number is: (773) 230-5221 in case someone wants to have
breakfast Sunday morning with a fellow Bus nut from Chicago..... (my number
is on the AIRS list also).

Pictures and trip report on Monday.

Later,

Dre
65 BJ
