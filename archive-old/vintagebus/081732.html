&gt;.....  We offered to buy the whole thing from the place, but they didn't
&gt;want to sell whole as there is no title.  We said &quot;no Problem&quot; to title
&gt;issue &amp; hope to still save it. Stay tuned.
&gt;.........
&gt;
&gt;Update: The Pick &amp; Pull will not sell this bus whole. Has anyone else dealt
&gt;w/ this issue.  It is to nice to strip &amp; crush or cut up.
