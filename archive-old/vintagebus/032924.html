&lt;&lt;  I have talked SEVERAL local parts
 departments and they said that the GL rating was not important.  &gt;&gt;
Hi,
All we know is that most of the reputible tranny rebuilders will not warrenty
thier work if tranny oil with rating GL4 at the least is used.  We have used
STA-LUBE 85/90WT with GL4 with no problem and it is availible nationwide which
is important to us on long trips in case we need a little.  Remember you never
want to mix different brands/Wts of grease or oils.  They also have a 80/90WT
with GL-4/5.           Eric &amp; Barb
