    Just sold the '70 westie yesterday, was really hard to see her go. I 
thought my son wasn't going to let them take it. The good thing is that she 
has a good new home and shes on the road like a westie should be. If any of 
you should see a forest green westie with a white top, give Kini and Ana a 
wave. Their on their way to Alaska from my place in Riverside. (they live in 
Hawaii) And of course lend them a hand if you see them broke down. I gave 
them my copy of the idiot book and Kini seems a pretty good mechanic but 
their still newbies. Well, if I can't be on the road, at least my bus can be.
As Uncle Jerry says &quot;drive em&quot;
