Subject: Split gas fill door on the left

A friend in Lake Havasu has a 1964 crewcab with the GAS FILL DOOR
ON THE LEFT side. Is this a one way street gas up on the left only?
This crewcab will be at jerome so we can look at it. I have never seen
a split bus with gas door on the left. Come to jerome to see it.
TRAILORS ARE FOR BOATS and drive your bus to jerome. See you there.
The Havasu Conection will be there in force, who is going to run the
ice run this year? No art with his buggy. Drive it or tow it, but don't
trailor it. Will have BBQ Bills super seasenings for sale at jerome. The
best ever, come by for a sample. We have JG hooked and he loves it.
SEE YOU AT JEROME!!! JOHN ( VWHOWARD ) 58 BINZ HOWARD
