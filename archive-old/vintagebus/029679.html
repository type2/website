Subject: carb spacer

I just got a digital camera and am having some fun with it....so i
thought I'd post a couple of pictures...

There you will find pictures of the carb spacer I milled up a while back
with my friend who works at the machine shop.  I don't know why...but I
think its cool.  I want to find some shorter studs now so that I don't
have to use washers so that the nuts will hold the carb down.
Anyways...just thought I'd post those for anyone interested.

Have a good friday everyone!  I'm headed down to IL today for the DBG
Halloween party.  40 lashes to Woody with an oily spark plug wire for
not being able to make it.  ;-)
