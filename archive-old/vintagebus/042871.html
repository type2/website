Picked up a gas heater among other things at the Spokane Bugfair today and
have quite a few questions about how to make it work.  First of all I have
the serial number and stuff and was wondering if someone could tell me
more info on it.  This is the important info off the tag:

Instant Heater
Made for Volkswagen
VW model 256-269
Model 8332B
Serial #3657

If anyone could point me to a web site or something with some info on how
to connect one of these beasts it would be much appreciated!
