&gt; But the parts list is a great reference.   Even says so in 
&gt; the Idiot Book, 
&gt; that Peter Ashwanden (the artist) love sthe VW parts list.  
&gt; Doesn't it show 
&gt; in his drawings?
&gt; 

Thanks for the input Clara. I agree the Parts list is great. I must be extra
anal cos I have 'read' the thing from cover to cover and have found parts in
there that I never knew existed.

Later
