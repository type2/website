First off Brian is a hell of a good guy..and drives a killer bus.

Second I think anyone male or female that drives an old split bus is totally
flipin' nuts!!  I do everyday and I wonder what the hell I am doin it for??  Its
mega slow...rides pretty much like crap...needs constant up keep...and is totally
underpowered. So   why the h#ll  is ANYONE driving them??  Because the are the
coolest looking MFin' thing on the road!!

And for the women driving buses thingy...man I think a female drivin' an old split
all alone down the road is the hottest thing!!!  My girlfriend drives my old buses
occasionally, and even for a brief stint (methinks 2 years in college)  drove a
cherry `67 hardtop deluxe of her very own.  I still meet complete strangers who
recall this hot chick drivin a killer old split to school everyday....needless to
say they never remeber seeing me in that old barndoor panel goin' 15mph in the
fast lane!!! Hmmmm???
