Subject: RE: [VB] I'm obviously a moron!!!

Ok, this is something that is taught in my begining metals class.  You will
need a rivet set of the size for your rivet.  These can be purchased at an
industrial supply store.  Be sure to take your rivet with you and get the
correct one.  A rivet set will run less than $10.

You also need a ball peen hammer.  This is a hammer that is flat on one end
and round on the other.

1.  Put the rivet set in a vise with the head pointed up.
2.  Install your rivet in the clip and wheel.
3.  Use vice grips on the back of the rivet to hold everything together.
4.  Set the head of the rivet in the rounded out part of the rivet set.
5.  With someone holding the wheel, remove the vise grips.
6.  Using the rounded part of the ball peen hammer, tap lightly around the
back end of the rivet.
7.  You are trying to &quot;mushroom&quot; the end of the rivet.  If you do it
correctly, each end of the rivet will have a nice rounded head.
8.  You can use the rounded out part of the rivet set to finish off the
back of the rivet.


&gt;[...] heat helps, as suggested. also try a centerpunch to start flaring the
&gt;rivet and then a normal 2mm or 3mm punch to finish flaring it.  just be
&gt;sure to have the round head of the rivet supported with the factory tool
&gt;(which i've seen for sale alot on ebay lately), or a bolt of the correct
&gt;length.  2 people does make it alot easier.  be sure you trust them and
&gt;they trust you, 'cause a flying hammer hurts, but you know that.

&gt;&gt; OK, I just spent an hour trying put hub cap retaining clips on one wheel,
&gt;how in the H#LL do you do this (1970 &amp; earlier 5 lug wide pattern wheels)??
&gt;I was trying to pound the little rivot flat on the back that holds the clip
&gt;and all I have to show is 3 smashed fingers!  Anybody have any tips they'd
&gt;like to share???
