    Once you get it all back together drive it in town for the first 300-500, 
 and do not drive it over 30 minutes at a time.  Keep changing oil at least 
 every 50 miles, till the oil stops turning black so soon.   This all will 
 allow the engine to polish all the corroded surfaces and not get to temps so 
 high that and oil sludge will come loose and clog up the oil cooler or 
 bearing/s.   Eric&amp;Barb &gt;&gt;

I ditto that.  The engine I am driving now in my 61 came with my 65 about 4 
years ago.  I babied it and changed oil frequently when I first drove it.  It 
got pretty gross pretty quick, you see.
