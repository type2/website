Just a note the SO 34 camper came from the factory without the section
behind the seats, this camper used the swivel seat body which was
manufactured without the bulkhead.  Check the M-codes on the camper and you
will see it says swivel seat-
M-code 199 (swivel seat) which comes from m-code 361 which comes from M-code
367.

&gt; Hi Thom,
&gt; The Westie SO-34 &amp; SO-35 Flip-seats are made with walk thru bodies.  Since
&gt; this was VW official camper conversion this seemed to be nessasary to keep
&gt; the structure as stiff as possible.  Even though for these buses the back
&gt; sections of the walk thru which would have been behind the walk thru seats
&gt; was cut down for the Flip-seat to fit properly.  Eric&amp;Barb
