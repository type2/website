 Does anybody know how to run 6 volt semaphores on a 12 volt system? I have a
 friend with them on his panel bus and I also have them on a 60 type 1, and
 both of us have the same problem. I recall back in the eighties that a
 electric device called a volt-a-drop was sold but cannot remember who sold
 these and if they would work on semaphores. I dont want to overload these
 things with double the voltage and kill them.

I heard something about this.  One thing is to get 12V bulbs so you don't 
melt the semaphore lenses- oops.
