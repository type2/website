Hi Adrian,
You probably just need to degrease the switch innerds with a degreaser like 
electronics contact degreaser.  Then use a electronics contact cleaner.  
Followed by carefully applying dielectric (Silicon) grease to the contacts to 
then seal them from oxidation.  Warning: Using an oil or normal grease will 
probably cause carbon build up on the contact points.    Eric&amp;Barb
