You wouldn't even need doctored papers.  Make up a bill-o-sale, go down to
DMV, cry that the title was lost, pay some money, and now you have a legit
title to a stolen truck.

I recall a story about a bus that was stolen recently in SoCal that someone
swapped the numbers in.

&gt;All you need to do is grind out the VIN in the engine compartment, fill the

&gt;your stolen PU is ready to sell with suitably doctored papers, freshly
&gt;printed on your hi-res ink jet printer.
