Well, you asked Dan, so here's my 2 cents.

Unless you specifically had an agreement with the borrower like &quot;if you break it
you fix it&quot;, then its YOUR bus...you get to fix it.  Its nice if he kicks in
some cash for &quot;wear and tear&quot; on your ride for borrowing it though. Since you
did lend it to him (for free??), I think he is obligated to help.  That being
said, the condition of the motor is a big IF.  Had you just rebuilt it, or was
it just running &quot;fine&quot;.

I had a motor that ran &quot;fine&quot; for a year and then crapped out huge amounts of
oil and went thud thud thud.  I didn't know the condition of it and it finally
let go.  If I'd of lent it to someone and it blew up, I wouldn't be as anxious
to get compensation from them.  On the other hand if I'd have just gone through
it and it came back in pieces, I'd be asking for some help and suspecting that
it was 75 and not 55 he was driving.

The condition of your friendship with the driver has a lot to do with it also.
Of course, this is just my personal opinion.  Everybody is different.
