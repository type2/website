I was driving Sunshine ('64 Westy) daily to work over the Santa Cruz
Mountains, a 65 mile round trip on top of a twice daily climb over a 2000
foot pass.  She was doing great until an emergency at home caused me to make
the drive like a madman, which lead to two broken bolts on the reduction
box.  Once I get her repaired, she will once again become my daily driver.

Years ago, I also used Sunshine as my daily driver to West Valley Communnity
College from my home on Skyline in San Mateo county, about 80 or 90 miles a
day and she never caused me to miss a day of class.

I say do it, just keep up the maintenance.

&gt; Ok folks. I know that many of you use your pre-67 vehicle as your daily
&gt; driver. My question is, how far is a round trip commute for you? I am
&gt; considering putting my '64 into commision for my driver, but my commute
&gt; is 65 miles round trip. Does that seem excesisive for a 35 (she was made
&gt;
&gt; in 63) year old vehicle?
&gt; I don't know much about the swingaxle rear end vs the irs.
&gt; So I am looking for your experience in driving your swing-axle every
&gt; day.
&gt; Thank you.
