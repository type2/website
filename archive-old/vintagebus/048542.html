Subject: The Dark Side of the Freeway Flyer

I'd like to add my experience FWIW to the 'Speed vs RPM' thread.

I've been running a 3.88 R&amp;P, .82 4th, Big Nut tranny with 195/75 14 LT
tires and a 1776 dp/30 pict-1/stock exhaust for some time in my '66 westy
and the best mileage I can get is 16, maybe 19 with a tailwind on a trip.
My daily commute to work yields 13-16 mpg at a steady 60 mph. I've tried
different jets, carbs, distributors, checking for tight bearings, dragging
brakes, etc. to see if I could push a little more from this combo with no
success.  Even a recent head rebuild didn't change anything. (compression
is close to even on all cylinders-approx 125 psi)

I originally built this engine for a bug; sold the bug-kept the engine. I
didn't like the 4.37 R&amp;P so I tried the 3.88 thinking I had the torque to
take advantage of the taller gearing at freeway speeds and 13-16 mpg is the
result. It looks great on paper, until you actually get to experience it
first hand.  I think a well-built 2 liter with dual carbs might make a
better choice for a 'Freeway Flyer', but I'm not going there.

I'd be real curious to see what you guys that are running straight axle
conversions are getting in terms of mpg. And be honest!

BTW, when I had the original transaxle, I was getting up to 25 mpg with the
same engine sporting Kadrons and single quiet muffler. When I changed
gearing, that's when the bottom fell out on my gas mileage. I think I'll
chock this up to experience, and I'm going back to stock gearing or at
least a 4.12 R&amp;P very soon.

If anyone has any suggestions or can point out something I may have
overlooked, I'm all ears.

Everett
