Yes, that smudge pot was nice and toasty, wasn't it!  I've looked around
the citrus groves near my home, but there were none to be found, so I'm

&gt; This is somewhat off topic but last Busses by the Bridge in Lake Havasu the
&gt; VTO bus group had a fire pot that they had lit on Sat. night.  Someone told
&gt; me that it was a fire pot for burning in the fruit groves to keep the fields
&gt; from freezing but that they were now outlawed for that use because of the
&gt; pollution that they put out.  It was about 6'feet tall and looked like it
&gt; could burn just about anything.
