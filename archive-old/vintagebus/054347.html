Subject: Re: [VB] Non-charging battery

[...]

From: &quot;jdd&quot; &lt;johndillon_at_sympatico_dot_ca&gt;:

So my battery doesn't wanna charge. I had it tested and they tell me the battery
is good.  My ground is a little shakey so I'm replacing that.  The red light
doesn't come on so that isn't an issue.  If it is a bad generator or a bad
voltage regulator how do I figure out which, if either, is bad. I'm still hoping
that it is the ground from the battery but that may not be the problem.  I don't
have a meter of any sort but this may be the excuse I need to buy one.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The red does not come? The red generator light?
Does it come on when you turn the key on?
If no, perhaps you should fix it 1st...... that circuit tells the regulator that
the key is on.
