&gt; Okay, I'm sorry but I have got to get this off my chest.  Hail to the
&gt; great NQ for allowing us the priviledge of seeing his &quot;private list&quot;.

Heh Heh -there's one in every bunch isn't there? :-)

For your information, I can't afford any more VWs for the next year.  I have
my 62 Double Cab and so I've now found the truck of my dreams.  I'm also $5K
+ in debt over my new shop I'm going to build.  No sense buying any more VWs
for a while.   I'm posting every single VW ad I find and withholding
absolutely no ads from anyone.

The website that I get these ads from, is a freely accessible site, and if
it really means that much to anyone, they can call one of the phone numbers
in one of the ads, and ask the people who they advertised with.  It's that
simple - really.  Seek and ye shall find. :-)

No offense was taken - I can see seething jealously when it rears its ugly
head. :-)

NQ
