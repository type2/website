&gt; I think it only makes sense to write to Wolfsburg if there is something
&gt; suspicious about your car, like it being 10 inches longer than it should
&gt; be.

I like the wolfsburg info, but you are right, it doesn't unlock any
great mysteries. Jut a cool document to have for your ride.

Then again, it used to be a free service.
