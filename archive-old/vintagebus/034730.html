&lt;&lt; What is the best way to take care of surface rust that is underneath ?
 I dont have a sandblaster and dont want to crawl underneath with a sanding
 block and go at it.  Should I take it to a Powder Coating place and let them
 do it ?  If so will have to disconnect all the cables from underneath
 before? &gt;&gt;
If you have a compressor or a friend with one, small ones run about 40 bucks.
And either way you'll want to pull the cables and block or tape off the tubes
so they don't fill with sand.  This would be a great time to clean out the
tubes and replace your cables.
  Peace, Love, and sorry but I have a hard time imaging life with out a sand
blaster,
