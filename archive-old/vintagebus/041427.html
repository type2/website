&gt; I need to know how the lights are supposed to work.  If I understand
&gt; correctly, the break light and the turn signal light is the same bulb with
&gt; two filaments.  Is that correct?  I think that the break light function is
&gt; totally independent of the turn signal/tail light function.  Correct???

I haven't checked it out carefully, but I think maybe not.  The 67 bus JP
sold me has no black box.  He used Euro tail lamp assemblies to work it
all out.  Brakes go to one bulb, signals to another.
