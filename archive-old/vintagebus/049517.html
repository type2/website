&gt;Oh, I can see it now - a week-long discussion on the relative merits of
&gt;standard vs. carbon block throwout bearings, along with a lengthy
&gt;dissertation from *someone* who has successfully repacked a throwout
&gt;bearing, or modified it to accept a zerk fitting so it can be lubed
&gt;whenever the engine is out.  Let the festivities begin!!  ;)

NOT TO MENTION that the Bentley shows how to drill a hole in the tranny
case so's you can spritz lube up on the noisy bastard...

why stop there? cut a lil hatch in the tranny bell so you can reach a hand
up there and replace in the dark w/ eyes closed ANY TIME YOU WANT :)
