  The Tinkertoy ran
&gt; cooler up to highway speeds.  If the air temperature was less than 80
&gt; degrees the oil temp would remain under 120.  Ran real cool in town.
&gt; However the dark side of the scoop would reveal it's nature.  Running at
&gt; 60 mph for 15 minutes, she'd heat up to 180.  Run 65+ for 15 minutes and
&gt; she'd hit 210.
&gt; 
&gt; Without the scoop I have noticed the following.  She runs warmer in
&gt; town.  The oil temp averages about 140.  At speed, oil temp climbs to
&gt; 180, but stays there even at 65 mph.

..you know, running around at 120 oil temperature is kinda tto cool.  You want it to be up to 170.  It's like goldilocks and the three bears, you want your oil not too hot, not too cool.   Guess you don't have a thermostat in there, they help the motor warm up quickly (and you get more heat in cold weather)   I'd say your temps are better w/o the scoops.
