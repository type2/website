I need three stationary windows for the fixed side windows (stationary) on my 
57 standard.
Need the &quot;SIGLA&quot; laminated glass.
Logo should look something like this.

       SIGLA
        AS-1
Made in Germany

There are other styles which say (D-06, or made in west germany, these will 
NOT work for me)

The glass can be cracked (NOT preferred) or delanimated (NOT preferred)

I need these to replace cracked ones in my glass cab divider. If someone has 
one with the correct glued on &quot;knob&quot; let me know. If not, I guess ill have to 
make one.

Id get them cut except they need to be of metric thickness to fit in the 
channels.

Please email me with what you have.
Thanks in advance for any help and/or leads.
Regards, Greg
