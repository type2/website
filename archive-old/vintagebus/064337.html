Subject: Re: [VB] Double Cab Wood Slats 

Hey kevin
VW originally used a compound between the slats and the bed called Sealing
compound D14. Every original truck I have seen, had a thin black (or at
least it looks black after 40-50 years) layer of that sealent between the
slat and bed the *entire* length and it was the width if the slat.
hope that helps

&gt; My question is &quot;Should I put silicone along the entire bottom of the slats
&gt; so that water can not get underneath them?&quot;
&gt;
&gt; This truck will see very little rain but my concern is more when I wash
it.
&gt; I was thinking that water would get underneath the slats and possibly just
&gt; sit there to cause future rust.
