Subject: Best way to support bus while wheels are off?
Date: Sat, 15 Aug 1998 12:08:30 -0400
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Good morning all!  If anyone's awake yet and this isn't too silly of a
question,  can someone please tell me the best and SAFEST way to
support my bus while the wheels are off?  My hubby has 2 jack stands
and we can get 2 more if that's best, or is there a better way?  I'm
selling my wheels and getting new ones but there will be a period of
several hours between removing one set and putting on the other.
Don't want to come home and find my Bulli sittin' on her belly! :-)
Thanks for your time and help!!!

P.S. If this answer is in the Idiots Manual, I apologize for not
having found it myself!  :-(
