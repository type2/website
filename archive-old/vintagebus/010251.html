I want to thank all of you who wrote me nice emails.  I've read them,
replied to a few, and deleted them all just as you get rid of old birthday
cards and things of that sort.

I think many of you are making this out to be much bigger than it really is.
I'm still a VW nut through and through - the same old NQ.  I'm NOT sitting
here all depressed or anything like that.  I've got a lot of projects going
on and am too busy to worry about things like this.  I am however still
going to massively throttle back my posts to the list as VintageBus is
getting too &quot;T2ish&quot; for me.  Instead, I'm going to concentrate my efforts
more towards our local Midwestern club/listserv called the Buskatiers.  I
know many of the people on our little email list and there's not a one of
them who would appreciate a helping hand.  I've met them all and we're like
one big happy family - much like I thought Vintage Bus was.  The Buskatiers
is one club that I really enjoy and my time and energies would best be spent
with those guys and helping to build up the club.

I'll privately email a bunch of you guys and gals that I've met on this
list.  I'm not disappearing or anything like that.  I'm not unsubbing as
there are still good posts that come through on the list so I'll be lurking.
I just want to prove how unegotistical I really am and fading into the
background would be the best move to make at this point.  Now that the
question has been raised, I think it would be best if I allow time to prove
that I'm not on some kind of ego trip.

NQ
