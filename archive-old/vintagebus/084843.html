&gt; Sometimes you find a muffler is maybe 1/8 inch too wde or narrow, as
&gt; heads can be different amounts apart depending on how much the heads
&gt; have been flycut and/or how much the cylinders ae shimmed out.

I had this happen when I was trying to put an Ernst muffler on the 1500
SP in my Bus.  By engine number it's a 1500 from a '68 Bug but it's a
rebuild with two different heads so who knows what's going on in there.
With one muffler flange on the studs, the other one was 3 or 4 mm too
far outboard to fit.  A little &quot;persuasion&quot; made the muffler fit.
