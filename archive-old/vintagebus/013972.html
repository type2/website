Subject: [VB] front shift rod coupler, how to loosen
Message-Id: &lt;199911122127.OAA27642_at_raptor.LPL.Arizona.EDU&gt;

Hi all,

I'm trying to replace the front shift rod bushing
on my '59 panel.  This requires removing the front
shift rod from the front coupler.  The set screws
came out easily but I'm having trouble getting the
coupler loose from the shift rod.

I've tried:

  soak everything in penetrating oil
  multiple &quot;heat with propane torch/cool with water&quot; cycles
  tapping on the coupler with hammer while holding shift rod

Does anyone have a good method for getting these parts
apart?  I haven't tried twisting them relative to each
other with pliers/vice grips.  What I really need is a way
to apply longitudinal pressure to the joint.  I tried
twisting a large screwdriver in the slot between the coupler
and the end of the shift rod (where it necks down) without
success.

Thanks for any advice,

 -Dyer Lytle in Tucson
