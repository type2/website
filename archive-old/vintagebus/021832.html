&gt; Easy questions for you Double Cab owners out there:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Which years was the bottom of the rear bench seat &quot;flat&quot;, 
&gt; i.e. the lower tube frame is completely flat, no bends or 
&gt; anything, except at the corners?  This in contrast to the 
&gt; front bench seat bottom where the front of the frame bends 
&gt; downward to meet the body.

My '60 Dcab built dec '59 has the dipped seat base.
 


&gt; 2. How does the rear seat bottom attach?  Is it the same as 
&gt; the front bench seat bottom with the 2 &quot;arms&quot; that extend 
&gt; into brackets at the rear of each side?

My front and back seats are identical. 


Later 

Michael
