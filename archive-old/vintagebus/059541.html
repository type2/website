Subject: Brake brights

Volks,

I bought a new brake switch because my new master cylinder was exerting
too much pressure on it, or so I thought.  I ride my bike to work and
when I got home yesterday there she was, sitting under the carport with
the brake lights on.  I had to take out the far left fuse to get them to
go off.  What is going on here?  I can't soften up the push rod in the
master cylinder any softer, or my brakes will be down too low.

What gives?  Any ideas?  

Curt
