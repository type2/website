HAHAHA!
They're even pickin' on the Gremlin!  &quot;Calling it a pregnant roller skate 
would be kind.&quot;
And the Pinto!  &quot;I took this car to a high-crime shopping mall and left it 
unlocked with the keys in the ignition. I came back several days later and, 
much to my disgust, it was still there.&quot;
This page is hilarious!  It's a sorrow I don't agree with the #10 spot.  
Question, didn't I see that EXACT SAME picture of the blue deluxe on Ebay 
last month?!
