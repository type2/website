Subject: Re: Oil strainer plate


&gt;There has been some talk the last few days about the paper gaskets used for
&gt;the oil strainer/plate.  But I'm surprized that no one mentioned 'reverse
&gt;dimpling' the 6 holes in the plate.

Just data: for the last three years I have been running the same cork
gasket on the drain plate of the 68. Above that is the aluminum stranier
which I have never changed although I remove and replace it several times a
year. There is no gasket at all between the strainer and the case.

It has never leaked a drop. It doesn't even weep from the acorn nuts.

Presumably the aluminum acts as an effective gasket between the case and
the ossified cork. 8) YMMV
