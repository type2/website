Subject: Solex NOT Weber (oops, my bad)

My engine was at work when I posted my last message, and I'd posted that
I had dual webers. I found out today that they are actually Solex/Brosol
40-44's (now sold under the name Kadron), which explains why I haven't
had any responses to my question about tuning them, I suppose...

Today I pulled the idle jets out, and they were clogged up. I guess that
explains why she wouldn't idle. I cleaned them up and stuck them back
in, loaded the new engine into the bus, borrowed the vacuum sync tool.
Now I'm ready for some tips from you old skool motorheads on tuning
them!

TIA,
david
