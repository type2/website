Subject: [VB] engine case Q

Matt,

I am not sure I should be dispensing engine advise since I have never
built one myself. So consider the source.

But, personally, I would not build a 1600 from this case because, for
one thing, it does not have case savers. So, to build a long lasting and
reliable engine, you will need to have the case savers installed. Why
not just find an old derelict Super beetle somewhere and pull the engine
from that. They are worthless ugly pieces of crap anyways. Might as well
make good use of the parts. If you find one made before 1974, it will be
carborated (SP?).

But, I am sure you will get lots of better advise than mine.

Les
