Subject: re Discontinuation of ads site?

What da heck is going on here--? I thought this was a list to help VW Bus People? Does
this mean that in due time i will also be attacked for posting VW Buses for sale that i
see and hear of? I've never made a dime on my listings--Just doing because i thought it
may help someone sell their bus --and another person find a bus--Kind of a VW Bus Adoption
Agency--If this is what it's coming to?? i guess i may as well put a stop to my
listings--TWWM, uj
