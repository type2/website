&gt; mmm,
&gt;
&gt; I don't think its Oz specific - South African Crews are the same.  I think 
&gt; all RHD split crews had the suicide passenger door until the end of 
&gt; production.....don't know why ... possibly cos the rear cargo door on a 
&gt; bus provides the 'standard' part needed and that just the way the 
&gt; 'hingeing' works out...
&gt;

I think it's more the door frame that's the &quot;standard&quot; part, though don't 
early RHD cargo doors have the handle on the rear door, too, Rob?

The RHD Bay Double cabs have &quot;normal&quot; left side rear doors, and I THINK that 
the post '64 RHD DCs had &quot;normal&quot; rear doors, but I can't be certain of 
that.

I know that my idea of welding the &quot;spare&quot; rear door frame into the driver's 
(right) side of Yeti would result in a suicide door on the driver's  side.

FWIW.
