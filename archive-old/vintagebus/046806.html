Hi Michael,
If you have strong hands you can do this with a standard slip-jaw pair of 
plyers or if you are not so good with your hands you should file grooves into 
the jaws to help hold the bell shaped retaining washer.  Take the bell shaped 
washer and hold it with the depression in it facing toward your plyers/hand 
with the plyers on the wider setting.  Then with the other hand not busy with 
the plyers you help install the spring which you pin in place with the 
plyers/retaining washer.  Then with you free hand you reach around to the 
inner side of the brake backing plate to install and apply pressure on the 
inner end of the pin which will stand it straight out to the brake backing 
plate.  Then press on the plyers/washer/spring until the head of the pin 
slides through the oblong hole in the retaining washer.  Rotate the 
plyers/washer 90 degrees to the pin tip and then release pressure a bit 
slowly to make sure wider pin end is locking into the slight depressions in 
the retaining washer.
