 I am restoring my '67 Sundial camper. It was based on a '67 Panel. The 
 vents at the rear sides, near the roof, seem to have been allowing water 
 to enter the backside of the cabinets. Is there some feature (part or 
 device) that would prevent this from happening. I do not want to remove 
 the vents as that would be deviating from stock. Any advice?
  &gt;&gt;

someone on the list had suggested using the flat wide magnetic strips to 
cover the inside of the vents when someone else had your same query.  Sounded 
a good solution to me
