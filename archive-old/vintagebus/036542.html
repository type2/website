Hey Jason have you seen your old red bus?  Krista sold it to this couple, who 
turned it a startling shade of purple!!!!  And replaced the steering Gear box.

 The 63 I am driving daily in Oly WA is a good runner. I havent timed it,
 tuned, or messed with it at all for two years except fixing the horn. Many
 thanks to Clara for letting me play with her horn stash. (LOL) Aside from
 how that sounds (pun, pun) Fixing a horn that has screws isnt that hard.
 File the points.
 
 Anyway.....
 
 My 63 gets from here to there and looks ugly and is even worse inside.
 Something has died in there. Literally. Smells terrible.
 
 The point is that there are nice busses here. The panel van yellow on white
 is awesome. Dual cargo doors, right and left, decent paint, no observable
 rust or dimples, just nice.
 
 Just had to say that for no good reason.
 Dont post often enough I guess.
