Hi all,

I'm getting ready to restore my safari wiper shafts and as always, there is
strength in numbers... i.e. the cost of making new shafts and reaming the
bushings is inversely proportional to the number of units that are done...
so, anybody out there need there shafts rebuilt?   Let's pool things
together and do it for less!


Talk to me!


David
