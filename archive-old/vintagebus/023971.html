1: 58 crewcabs have ribbed bumpers and full belly pans .
 2: 100 degrees? we duct tape the vent grill to stop the cold air from
coming in. Drive to and from in 115 degree and it gets warm, over 120
and it gets hot. From the hottest spot in the whole U.S.A. ( more
hottest days than anyother city in the U.S.A.) we ONLY use Castol racing
20/50 and dog house coolers. Thats it, and change oil every 1000 miles
or before and after each out of town trip.

hump seat and 3 way adjustable seat back.
