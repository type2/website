What tools do you have?  I just did this on my '54, and between
me and several others on the list, we could probably talk you
through it.

I have rocker panel repair details on my site, under the 'howto' section.
I didn't detail the dogleg installation because I didn't do mine in
the fashion a &quot;normal&quot; person would.

There might also be pix _at_ metwiz_dot_com

&gt; that could help me replace my dogleg with an used factory one.  I also need 
&gt; some help on some MINOR pass rocker repair.  The part that needs to be 
&gt; replaced is the upper part that goes  over the rubber seal.
