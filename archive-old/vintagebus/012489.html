I guess you mean top speed is the highest speed you can push it to, hm?  
But-  what is the gearing you have?   big or little nut RGboxes
(axlenuts)  what gearing is
the type 3 tranny? [you] are winding the piss out of it to get to
63.Truck that I had was very low geared-

***********************************************************************************
that was it. i had half of a heater that i was feeding all of the
lukewarm air to the drivers side windshield 
half the time I had a semi truck trying to crawl into my exhaust pipe on
an ice covered bridge the other half i was trying to launch to a freeway
on ramp and merge across 5 lanes of rush hour traffic to get to a cutoff 
and ah er  i was so cold that my right foot was frozen to the floor yah
that's it  i was soo cold
 the effects of the concision after the bridge wreck are just now going
away and that was in december.

okay
small nut RGboxes
Type III final drive ratio;4.125:1
Bus boys and wolf gang never emailed me back on this one
What year is it?
type III trans
composit four bolt hubs
stamped #'s D0164765
casting #'s  113301103D
acording to their websites the 67,68 trans is the bitchin unit to have. 

also 3,000 rpm at 60mph sounds fine to me
65 flat out (every ten years on the bluemoon)
15&quot; rims chance em?

aloha
no ice here Heehee
