This is not always the case, I have a 67 Sundial with
the window behind the cargo doors and my Sundial was
converted from a 11 window bus not a panel.

It was always my understanding that Westphalia was the only camper VW
allowed to convert from a kombi. All the others had to use panels. Am I
wrong?
