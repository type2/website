Hi NQ.

No need for a web page, as it doesn't get much simpler :)

To clarify, you are asking about conversion to a Bosch AL82N or equal
Alternator with internal regulator?

The 6v to 12v stuff I assume you have already figured out... too?

Anyway... you are likely having trouble because it is TOO simple!  All the
wires you normally run from generator to regular are no longer needed, as
this thing is pretty much plug and play.  There are only THREE wires you
need:

  1.  Main connector goes to battery.  Heavy duty wire here, as up to 50
amps of charging is taking place over this lead.
  2.  The spade connector goes to the green (?) wire that lights your
charging light on speedometer.
  3.  There is also a screw on top near where the strap goes. You are
supposed to connect a ground wire here, but they typically work without one.
I think it is for safety if grease or other problems prevented normal body
ground connection.

That is IT.  In simple terms, you only need 1 wire for the thing to work...
#1.  All the rest are not essential to operations (assuming it is on a stand
that conducts ground).

Is that what you wanted to know?

I've referenced the archives, web sites, and old emails and I'm still coming
up at a loss as to how to convert my bus from a 6 volt generator setup to a
single wire alternator setup (Alt. from a bug.)  All my wiring is stock
(except for Frank Hill's solenoid conversion - god rest his soul) in this 66
bus so if anyone can tell me in a step by step procedure what I must do to
convert over (concerning what wires to cut or connect where), then I'll make
a web page with pictures and documentation so that others doing the same
thing will have some kind of reference to go off of.
