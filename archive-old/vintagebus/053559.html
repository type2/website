Subject: re: Trailering a bus


Michael said:
The trailer that UHAUL rents and which I am planning
on using 
(their AT trailer) is 14' long dual axle which I hope
is long enough- has 
someone actually used a UHAUL AT (Auto Transport)
trailer and can vouch 
that the bus will actually fir on the trailer?

Back in 1988 when I bought my 65 doublecab sight
unseen,  it was in Pueblo, Colorado, and I live in
Wisconsin.  I planned to tow it home, so I  borrowed
my father-in-law's 1978 ford 3/4 ton  pickup, 300ci
six with a 4 speed, with a cab-over camper on it, and
headed out with my wife and 3 small sons.  When we
bought it, we decided to rent the U-Haul trailer
(&quot;Adventure in Moving&quot;, right?) and had no problems
with it.  Truck had enough power, it trailered fine,
and the double cab is still part of the family (since
joined by a 75 bus to replace the old 68 and 72 buses
that had seen too many Wis winters).
The bus fit fine on the trailer that they had then--I
think it even had a winch to helpus pull the truck up
on the trailer.
Good luck.

Jim (still in Wis)
