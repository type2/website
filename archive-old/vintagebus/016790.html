There are literally hundreds of options.   Hundreds.  And odd combos 
thereof.

This is the biggest problem I have with the new &quot;ebay motors&quot; site;
they try to compartmentalize all cars to a rigid set of definitions.
It was a pain in the ass trying to list my '55 - I had to enumerate
the transmission type, *mileage* (who freakin' cares, it's 45 years old!),
interior and exterior color, etc.  Other classifieds I've seen try to
capture too much info, which makes it a PITA for the users.

&gt; Hey everyone.  Im developing a Classifieds/Auto Sales app here at work and
&gt; figured I'd apply the Beta to VW's..  (and why not?!!)  This app is gonna
&gt; work alot differently than anything you've seen so far on the other
&gt; classified sections on sites so i need some advice.  The biggest thing is
&gt; options for vehicles.
&gt; 
&gt; When placing a listing for a vehicle the listee will choose from a set list
&gt; of options as well as having a write in box.  Everyone start naming off all
&gt; the options i should include relating to VW's (ie sunroof/ragtop, popouts,
&gt; engine sizes, and so on)  After 2 weeks of coding I'm almost ready to
&gt; release this thing but my head cant hold anymore info so i need all the help
&gt; i can get so i dont overlook anything.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, since this wont be a commercial effort for the VW beta, i have all
&gt; kinds of advertisement sections available for FREE!!! to any of you with
&gt; business' relating to repair, part sales, insurance, VW dealersship or
&gt; resellers.  Also, i do have a banner space for vw hobbyist sites too.  2
&gt; sizes for the banner 145x87 if anyone wants to submit one. and the usual
&gt; 468x60.
