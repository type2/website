Has anyone ever installed big-*ssed air shocks and a compressor so they could just bounce all over the place in their bus...lowering for that &quot;slammed and damned&quot; look...and raising for that &quot;going fishin' across that thar stream&quot; look?

That's what I'm gonna do. That way I'll please everyone! 

BTW, please forgive me if someone already suggested this. I've been indiscriminately deleting all the lowering and raising notes.

:-P Joe
