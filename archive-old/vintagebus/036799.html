&lt;&lt; Can anyone help me with my back-up lights?  Where does the wire go on the
 tranny and is it part of the it or is there a switch that screws in?  I
 can't seem to find any terminal for it.
  &gt;&gt;

having just installed backup light wiring on 3 VWs, I remember this. 

from the hot side of the coil (where the wire from the front goes, #15) a 
black wire goes right, then gets a inline fuse.  The fuse is important as it 
will blow if there is a short somewhere.  Then it disappeares forward.  it 
runs to the front of the tranny wher ethe switch is, then another wire goes 
back from the tranny and hooks up to the wires that takes it to the reverse 
lights.

well, you have to have a switch on the nose cone of the tranny, which was 67 
half year only, though I know they made them later.  I put nose cones with 
switches in my 65 and 61, cause I wanted to add reverse lights (bug style 
ones attached to the bumper at the left side.  If some PO swapped the trans 
and you have no switch, then you have no switch.
