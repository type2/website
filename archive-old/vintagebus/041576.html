3 - Start engine.  The lamp must go out when the gauge indicates pressure
above 0.6 atm.  (8.5 lbs/sq. in.).  Below this pressure the contact should
be
closed and the lamp on.  With the engine cold, the lamp should go out at
normal idling speed, and with the engine warm it should go out as the
speed
increases.  If the lamp goes out too late, the adjusting screw must be
turned
anti-clockwise.

If I read and comprehend it is saying that on a warm engine it is normal
for the oil light to be on at Idle. I see it doesnt mention flickering
either.
