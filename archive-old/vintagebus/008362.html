Les,

While I'm not 100% certain, I'm PRETTY certain that the orange/blue VW
driveaway tent I have for my '75 has an external frame (been a couple of
years since I got it out of the storage unit, having an &quot;interesting&quot; life
at the moment :o(

I AM certain that I've seen pics of Westies with external frame tents on one
(or some) lister(s) sites.

They're obviously original equipment.

Regards,

Neale

&gt; No one answered my question concerning the engine numbers. is a block
&gt; marked with three O's a factory replacement block?
&gt;
&gt; I think I may have found a driveaway tent for my westy. I was in a
&gt; machine shop that I just did a sign for at actuel materials cost (may be
&gt; the brightest thing I ever did), and the guy I did the sign for was
&gt; reparing a tent pole for some girl he knows. He said she just purchased
&gt; this tent at a yard sale and was gonna put it on ebay. Except for the
&gt; pole he is repairing, it sounds like the one I need. One thing I am not
&gt; sure of though is, he thinks it has an external frame. I thought westy
&gt; tents had an internal frame. Can anybody shed some light on this? Even
&gt; if its for a sundial, I may get it because it would likely work, would
&gt; look great and could always be used for trade material to get the
&gt; correct tent.
&gt;
&gt; Les
