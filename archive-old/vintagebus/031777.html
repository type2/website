There is also differences in the lip and the indentations on the back of the
shroud, for instance 54 BD only and 55 only, but I was told 55 and up are
the same, this is BD 55 and up. I was told and showed this by a BD engine
Geru.

ps. I have also just been informed that pre A Porsche 356 and early A cars
used the same shroud. I'll have to dig theough my 356 shrouds and try to
see.

yes there are different ones.  Without talking about the early 25hp ones 
(which fit the same) there are 2 36hp I think- the kind  that have the holes

for the rubber spark plug wire holders, and the kind that dont, for the
54-56 
VWs with the metal spark plug wire holder that clipped to the intake 
manifold.   Probably there were bug and bus versions, with the bendy tabs
for 
the wiring in different places.  

Ever realise that BD front tin is diff than post bd front tin, as thebd 
version does not have the hole for the fuel line?

 List:
 
 I was told today that there are several different 36 hp fan shrouds, i.e. 
different wire clips, etc., depending on what production year the bus is.  I

always thought a 36 hp fan shroud was a 36 hp fan shroud.
 
 If there are differences, please enlighten me, and the list, what they are.

My '59 bus was built in 11/58 so I'd love to know *which* fan shroud I
should 
be looking for.  And BTW, if anyone has a ding/dent free 36 hp fan shroud 
with all the clips intact that is correct for my year, I'd be interested in 
buying it if you're interested in selling it.
 
 TIA.
