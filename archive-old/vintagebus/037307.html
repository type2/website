I know this is the vintage bus list I have a 63.
But I thought I could at least advertise!

The 63 is getting a 1776, something I never thought I would do. But I need
an engine and I am putting it in.


So the point is:
1969 VW Camper for sale.
I was the second owner, and now I am the fourth. It has come around back to
me, as I requested when I sold it.
Rust? Yep lots of it, moslty along the lower sides. Never been in an
accident though. Childs cot, hammock, rear mosquito net, pull out stereo (
and I still have the original radio). Complete front end for replacement
included (needs it) , new brakes with all new slave cylinders installed, new
shocks, new clutch, new clutch cable, original manual with stamps inside,
oil temp guage.
This bus is not pretty, but straight and was one of the best busses I have
ever owned. Just feels right. Something about this bus is good, cant
describe, must enjoy it for your self. 
Oh yeah, weird extra: It has a external oil cooler with a fan set up to cool
the oil. 

I am asking for $900. 
I live in Olympia WA
