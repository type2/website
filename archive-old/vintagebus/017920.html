A coworker got her non-VW painted there.  From 20 feet away, it looked
nice.  Up close it had lotsa orange peel.

But for your purposes, ie put paint on it, it should be OK.

I think they have a deal where you can have them put extra paint on it,
so you can wet sand it later.  Something along the lines of &quot;cut and polish&quot;

&gt; don't know.
