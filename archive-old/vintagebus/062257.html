Subject: FW: [VB] Dual circuit master cylinders

I installed a '67 mc, no big deal, you have to adjust the piston and add a
short (about 8 inches) piece of brakeline to the front port, then install a
brass &quot;T&quot; to that so you can connect both front brake lines.  Also the fluid
reservoir is different than earlier buses, there are two compartments for
the dual cylinder, sometimes hard to find because they only made them
for'67's, I have heard that a reservoir from a VW Rabbit would fit.  The new
'67 mc cost me $150.

Subject: [VB] Dual circuit master cylinders


To go with my new OldSpeed 944 front brake conversion I want to fit a dual
circuit master cylinder to my 66 bus.
OldSpeed at the moment would use a 67 only m/c modified to remove the
residual pressure valve, but are working on fitting a Golf/Jetta master
cylinder.
