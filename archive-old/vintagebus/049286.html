List:

Anyone have any suggestions on what material to use underneath the gas tank straps on the 4 top corners?  I'm not sure what the original material was, it's always too far gone in my buses to tell, looks like a horsehair type material or something.  

I thought about using some cork sheeting, for lack of a better word, but if someone has a good idea I'm open.

TIA.

Robert
