Thanks everyone, that is exactly the stuff I needed to hear about. You
guys are an unbeatable resource. Now I'm kind of fearful of all that
can go wrong, but I did ask for it. Hopefully I will be prepared. And
lucky.
One thing in particular now has me worried - cracked windshield from
flying gravel. I'm sure the answer is going to scare me, but I have
got to know: What happens to Sekurit AS1 windshields when they fail?
Should I be weraing safety glasses while driving this bus?
I like Thom's bus A tows bus B idea best. Anybody got a bus B for me?
At this point I think I can afford to pay a cool 5 bucks, but I'll
return it with a full tank of gas...
I really appreciate your suggestions, and I hope I can pass on the
favor some day.
