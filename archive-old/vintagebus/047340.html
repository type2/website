Last time i registered them.....
I had YOM 56 plates (commercial) on a passenger car.
I walk in with my commercials, NOS, currently registered to the bus but In 
the P.O.'s name and told her I wanted these on the car.
She FLIPPPPPPPPED!!!!!!!
Took about two hours to sort through it!
Then at the end she told me she had to confiscate the plates that were 
previously on the bus (NOS 56 YOM's)
I told her NO FREAKING WAY!

&lt;&lt;I've always said...if you plan on registering YOM (Year of Manufacture)
plates in California, you need to know more about the process than they do.
It's not tough...but you just need to know you're right so you can
effectively argue when they want to destroy your plates. They seem to want
to do that often...that's what they tried on me too.

Yeesh...Congrats on getting it done! Those plates will look GREAT on that bus!
