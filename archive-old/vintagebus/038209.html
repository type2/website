For whatever reason, the paint did not flow at all.  I have all kinds of
orange peal on the lower red.  Kind of a bummer.  I have decided to sand
it all off and start over.  It will be less work to go in with 200-400
grid paper and reshoot it then to go over the whole bus with 1500-2000
paper and buff it out.  I do not want to hand buff all the door jam's
and such.  This will set me back about 10 hours of sanding.

I must say that I have factory orange peel in the SWR on the dash of my 61
NSRdeluxe.   I also have factory paint drips in the engine compartment (I
think in the 61, might be the camper)  When my camper was painted it had more
orange peel and drips in the white than the green.   It was clear and dry out
when the white was painted, and raining out whe the green was painted, and I
think the moisture helped against orange peel but I am no paint expert and
could be totally wrong but the green did go on nicer.   

I wouldn't sand it all off, just sand it smooth.    

also, my 61 was the entire thing painted SWR inside and out (only a dusting
under the headliner though, the cheap rust encouraging  VW people they are,
they just made it shiny paint where you'd see it), then the top half painted
BG (beige grey).    The dash is red, the painted on the roof worn through the
BG shows SWR.   Shortly after my 61 was made, they switched the order and
painted the entire bus the top half colour, and then added the bottom half
colour on the outside (so later spits have dashes the color of the top of the
bus)  For whatever that's worth.
