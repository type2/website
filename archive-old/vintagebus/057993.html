&gt; My brake pedal is real sloppy. I have regreased it, installed a new spring 
&gt; and it still isn't too great.  Can these wear out? Can a new sleeve or 
&gt; bushing be put in or are they even available?

Hi Sean,
If you mean the pedal is loose on its shaft, then yes they can wear out!  
Part 211 721 153C Bush - Brake pedal lever from Chassis No. 20-117 902.  
Check section 7, illustration 37 in the 1958-67 parts manual on the Obsolete 
Air-Cooled Documentation Project on Vintagebus_dot_com!   Eric&amp;Barb
