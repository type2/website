Subject: 1600DP Beetlemex 0-mile Engine, $980, thread on type2

I wanted to post this thread on the vintagebus list, as I believe it only
took place on the type2 list.

  http://www.beetlemex_dot_com/enginesR.htm

Basically, Dan Henry in Indiana started a thread about a new Beetlemex
engine he was purchasing.  The low-down is that they are selling 0-mile
Mexican engines for $980, far below what I've seen anyone else selling them.
((Archives will reveal that Thom posted they were selling them for $1150
back at the start of the year.  Further research will show that I tried a
group purchase of 0-mile Mexico engines further back but that we could not
get a deal much better than what local VW FLAPS were selling them for,
anywhere from $1200 to $1300)).  Everything I know tells me that $980 is a
great deal.

Anyway, I think that this has enough interest to pass along to the
vintagebus list.  Hydraulic or solid lifters, your choice.  The company is
pretty Internet savvy and I am expecting my engine to arrive by this time
next week.  $1050 shipped to Seattle via UPS...  I could have paid $100 more
and had it shipped with a trucking company.

  Dan's first message on the topic:

  Here is Dan's report on how it arrived:

There has also been other discussions, 18+ messages containing the word
Beetlemex:

Anyway -- I'll be reporting on how the engine arrives.  Overall, they have
been GREAT to deal with -- although I would recommend that anyone going
through a purchase don't bother with wire transfer.  It is cheaper to just
overnight them a personal check and have them hold it for a week.

Anyway, the new 1600 will be going into my '63 crew so I can push Todd
Hill's custom-built tranny, due to arrive within 2 weeks!  It was great to
meet Todd at the phew-Al-up show Sunday.  I think I've decided to put on the
dual Kadrons I have, the photos of the Resto-From-Hell (RFH) in the November
Hot VW's was the straw that balanced it toward the Kads.   Plus, recent
generator replacement might have been another factor :)
