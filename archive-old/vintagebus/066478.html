Subject: re:gas mileage

check the tuning...air pressure, tire size...i am sure these all effect it.
also try waxing your car, that way the air slides past it with less
resistance ;)

i think there was a survey done about 1-2 years ago, if you check the
archive.

as for my bus- i have gotten up to 26 mpg, highway traveling around
55-60mph, with a full roofrack. i notice if i go between 60-65mph the
mileage dips down around 20mpg sometimes even less.

i have a 1600 single port, single carb(cant remeber the size, but i think it
is a 30/31), header and single quiet-pak exhaust.

i have a e-z camper interior, for weight comparison.
