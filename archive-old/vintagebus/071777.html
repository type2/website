&gt; After all that, the new cable from Bus Boys doesn't come with an E clip so

Hi Ray,
We have never heard of an E-clip, but have seen C-clip used there.  We hate 
the C-clips because they tend to spring off into oblivion especially during 
field repairs when being removed.  We now drill the new speedo cables ends 
and install a cotter pin like as was used in the 1950-60s VWs.
