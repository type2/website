Subject: Middle seat Q.  65 Samba

Can any tell me how the middle seat (full w/ 1/3 fold down) ash tray on
the back of the seat was attached?  Was it just rivited thru the seat
material?  Did it have any type of backing?  I am fairly certain that
the ash tray is the same type as on the spare tire cover.  Was the base
the same?

Thanks
Matthew
