&lt;&lt; I just noticed that my hot-running 1641 hydraulic has a sand seal but no
crankcase vents except for the oil filler tube vent into the air filter.  Its
a wet engine...could this have something to do with it?  Could this have
something to do with running hot?   At any rate I'm putting a stock pulley on
it soon so I'll see if that
 makes a difference.

Hi Markus,
By stock pulley do you mean with the stock threaded type to throw the oil
forward into the engine?  If so it will not work with the sand seal and if
your engine case has been cut for the sand seal, then you can not go back to a
stock pulley.  Unless you have it machined to seal with the sand seal.  If you
have the softer aluminuim after market pulley it might have worn out and
replacing it with a stock steel pulley machined to work with the sand seal
might stop the oil leak and will last longer.  A breather system would
probably be a good idea also.    Eric &amp; Barb
