Subject: Help picking a cam for 2007

I am pretty stuck here...

What is a good cam for a 2007 (90.5x78.4) that will go in a heavy '66 Westi?

Carb will most likely be a 30P1 or 34P3 to start with... Or maybe just suck 
it up and get dual Dell DRLA 40s.  Later it will run CIS fuel injection, but 
that might be a while off...  I almost fear putting on the DRLAs as I will 
never want to complete the FI swap!  LOL

I have a stock cam waiting which was my first instinct to keep the low end 
torque... But many people have beaten me over the head not to do that as it 
is a waste of potential power.

I also have a CB Performance Eagle #2233 sitting here with 272 duration, 234 
_at_.050&quot;, .371&quot; at the cam.

Many have said the Engle 100 with 1.25 rockers is the way to go with dual 
carbs.

FUD factor here big time!  Fear Uncertainty and Doubt!  Ahhh :)

Building an engine is a fun thing, just too many difficult decissions 
sometimes.

Thanks,
Adrian Pillow
