It's not locked into my backyard yet, the owner will empty the junk out of
it over the next few weeks. It's a 21 window sunroof, without a sunroof.
Tracks are there, no cables, winders, pulleys or whatever magic makes them
work. It's covered by a loaf Westy top to keep the rain out. Surface rust
only, left side wiped out below the belt otherwise straight. No middle seat,
clock in dash, blue/white over velvet green. Belly pan intact, many tubes of
silicone on all the fixed windows. Glass, bumpers and outside trim intact.
No interior except for bench seat cover.
My questions...  is it laughably impossible to find the sunroof mechanism?
Or should I graft some steel on and call it a hardtop deluxe with bellypans?
I didn't dicker with his $1000 price, and I think he's feeling it was too
high, so he's going to give me a pile of spare parts he's collected over the
years. After 2 doublecabs and a Thing, this is going to be plush.
