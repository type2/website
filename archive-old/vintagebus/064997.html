&gt; Another problem they said with magnets is that heat can affect
&gt; them?.

Heat can affect magnets, but not at oil temperatures

&gt;   This filter magnet is so strong that I CANNOT pull it straight off the
&gt; filter, it has to be slide off the end. Another funny note was that the demo
&gt; filter was a cheapo Fram and mine are Premium MANN. I did learn that the
&gt; thickness and quality of the metal has something to do with magnets
&gt; sticking. I could pull the magnet off of the Fram can.

thin metal will be attracted less.  There is a problem with passing a
magentic field through a ferrous surface.  Most of the field goes along
the surface.  The thin Fram can would probably work better with the
magnet!

A better approach would be to embed the magnet in a non-ferrous part, so
that the full magnetic field would be available to trap ferrous particles.

&gt; for free it's worth a try, for the 49.95 retail, well I don't know

Seems like I'd rather get a neodymium magnet from that wondermagnets page
for a buck or two.  Stronger magnet and cheaper price.
