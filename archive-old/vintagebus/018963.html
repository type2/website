&gt; By &quot;frame is done&quot; I assume you mean before you start putting outer body 

Yes, sort of.  Currently, the lower nose is off, it has no cargo floors
or belly pans, etc.

No; as part of the blasting deal they shoot the car with primer like DP40 

I actually prefer if the repro panels came bare or with minimal primer.  That
