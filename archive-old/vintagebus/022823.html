Subject: Rebuilt Steering Box Sources?
Mime-Version: 1.0


A friend of mine needs a rebuilt steering box for his '64 single cab.
What's the best source of a rebuilt one, and where do they fall,
price-wise.  Any feedback on the quality of the rebuild would be
appreciated as well.

In addition, is it possible to get a locking column box rebuilt thru one of
these vendors?
