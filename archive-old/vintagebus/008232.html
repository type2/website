&gt;530 is ambulance step





My bus has had ambulance step, but I dont have 530 on my m-tag, why?

My M-Tag:

06 05 1


008 149 151

NO   271   SK1025C   775052 


This bus is a Norwegian military ambulance. And I know that 149 means that all crome is painted. The bus itself &quot;was&quot; painted in Olive green, and has had a gas heater.

BTW is there anyone out there that knows the meaning of the M-tag 751??
