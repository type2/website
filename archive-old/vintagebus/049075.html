Subject line says it all.  So that I don't take up bandwidth, it is in very good to excellent condition and complete.  It is ALL original, nothing reproduced.  Both hoops and hoop caps, center strap and canvas.  No missing hardware, no tears in the canvas, and no significant staining.  A hard to find score.

Pmail questions and price info, trades are welcomed but I don't need much.  Pics available.  Thanks.
