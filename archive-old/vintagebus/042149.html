&gt; I'm not sure what you mean here.  I thought it came in on both sides.
&gt; I have a heat riser on either side of the carb pedestal, and each one
&gt; goes down to a small flange near the rear cylinder exhaust port on
&gt; the heads.  These flanges bolt to mating flanges on the intake side
&gt; of the muffler.  I thought each heat riser was a closed-off tube -
&gt; just a &quot;dead end&quot; for some hot exhaust to hang out in.


Nope.  If you look at a good stock muffler you will see that one side is
an inlet...that is, into the heat risers, and the other an outlet.

The outlet side is a tube that goes into the muffler, where the flow
pressure should draw the gases from the higher pressure inlet.

or something like that.
