Subject: re:I need to idle

was written:
&quot;yes I know, I'm bad but it was -30 degrees with constant snow and rain for
the last six months so I haven't driven it but 200 miles.&quot;

sounds like a problem I have with my bus sometimes-I think waer condenses in
the fuel tank or carb or soemone inthe system, adding &quot;drygas&quot; to my tank
always helps. My friend with a &quot;b*g&quot; has the same problem in the winter,
makes pulling out into an intersection a little hairy(is it gonna stall?)
drygas I guess it somehow grabs the water in the fuel and gets it out ofyour
system. not sure how it works, but it works for me. You may need to add a
bottle through a couple tanks, to get it all out of your system.

cheap too, I think it is less than $2 a bottle.

also-as you mentioned that the filter got dirty pretty quickly, I would get
a couple filters and try to keep changing them until they are clear-if you
can't reach this stage, you may need to pull the gas tank and clean it
