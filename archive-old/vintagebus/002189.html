Hi guys and gals,
    Just got back on line after 4 1/2 months without a computer. I'm still
doin' the daily driver thing with the 66 van,( it needs LOTS of attention
mechanically now) just keeps on truckin along.  It's all over Vegas all the
time ( just look for a red and blue panel if you get out this way).

    Some dummy forgot to unsubscribe or turn off his mail program when he
went computerless so, had over 5500 mails to go thru ( some good bus reading
I didn't want to miss).  Still working on them but, I am back up and online
again.  I hope to have a web page with the 66 and maybe the baja up soon.

Jon ( vwjon_at_wizard_dot_com  again!!!!)
