Ok I have here talk about this slanted (westie) roof rack from time to time.
I do not believe I have seen one. I searched a few of the VW sites trying to
find a picture of one but was unable to locate one. Does anyone have one
they could snap a few pics of, or a link to where a picture already is?
Thanks
