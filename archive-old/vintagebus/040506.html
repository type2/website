Hey everybody:

I may have mentioned this before, but when my garage burned down back in
1999, I had a 2084cc engine that was destroyed.

The engine was apart at the time and the 78.4mm crankshaft was sealed in a
plastic box and sprayed with oil to protect it from rust.

After the fire, I found it in the rubble. It was burned and then rusted from
the water used to put out the fire but it looks straight.

I contacted Rimco and they said that (assuming that it is straight) they
could regrind it and magniflux it and that it should then be good to use.

Does anyone have any other suggestions as to what should be done? Some sort
of heat treating maybe? I am not sure if the fire weakened it or not.

I tried using some drill bits that went through the fire and they were all
useless except maybe for driling into soft wood.

Skid
