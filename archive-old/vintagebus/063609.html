&gt; The torsion arms have a number below the VW mark, is this the year? The 
&gt; &quot;original&quot; ones say 2. The one I got from Tom Mink from a 66 has a 6. 
&gt; The ones from Bus Boys says 5.
&gt; 
&gt; The other difference is the mount for the shock absorber. Mine is at least 
&gt; twice as thick as the other ones.
