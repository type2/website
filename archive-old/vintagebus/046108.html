&lt;&lt; I know that this is a pretty dumb question, but I'm not sure what kind of 
tar
 you're specifying - is this stuff ever available in a caulking gun 
container?  &gt;&gt;
Hi Paul,
No you can not get it in a caulking gun container.  Which is why you need a 
condiment container with removable tip cover from your local supermarket.  
For tar we use &quot;Henry #108 Asphalt Coating and Lap Cement.  Non-fibered, 
Brush Grade, Solvent Based.&quot; and it comes in one or five gallon cans.
