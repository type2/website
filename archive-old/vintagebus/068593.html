&gt; Tell me about your tool organization and what works best for a
&gt; cheapskate with tons of hand tools.

Rex,

I buy one of everything- best available (Craftsman, Allen, Proto, etc),
then as I find I need more 13mm wrenches, I buy them. That way, everything
I have is reliable, long lasting and warranteed for life. I needed another
11mm one day, so I bought it. Now I have two. I keep all the smaller tools
in one toolbox, in the bus. I keep the larger things wherever they can be
fitted inside the bus - everything's out of sight in my setup. Specialty
tools that are too big or heavy stay at home. I do not buy any size of
anything that my bus does NOT use, though. I keep the tools clean and
oiled/lubed as necessary. THey're always there when I need'em.
