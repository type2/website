Whats in your hole?
Rusted AIDS infected needles, little teeny bits of
dried white bar soap, a hidden gram of cocaine and a
loose ended joint. Also look carefully for those
really small stamp looking pieces of paper with a
dancing bear on them.

That is my fear every time I buy a used vehicle.
Rationale for doing what I call a &quot;roach check&quot;.

One the positive side I found $300. in a 68 Chevelle
that I bought for $150. once!!!! =) Car was sold to me
because the DPO couldnt afford it. Hahahahah!
