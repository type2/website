Oh and then theres Clara's 'mystery' color she used, which was a damn 'close
&gt;match'. But for some reason she wouldnt release the information to us.

She's working on it, and will post the info when it is available.
The color name, &quot;Chameleon&quot; is meaningless without the
manufacturer's name and the actual inventory #. And Clara
made the match to the current faded color, not the original.
