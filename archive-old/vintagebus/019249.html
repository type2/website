It's ironic how a good portion of the politicians are 
all up for strengthened borders, shooting braceros on 
sight, etc, but at the same time are pushing through 
even more insidious legislation!  I'm referring to the
ever-increasing H1-B quotas, which allow for the 
importation of hundreds of thousands of high-tech and
skilled workers, who - in hopes of getting a green card -
work for low wages, and are in effect indentured servants
because they can't leave their employer (ie if they feel
they're being mistreated or underpaid) without being
deported.  I know a lot of you on the lists are in
the computer industry in the US, and this affects *you*
directly: as we head into a recession and the layoff 
announcements get bigger with each passing day, your
low-wage replacements are quietly being brought in to
fill the alleged labor &quot;shortage&quot; - you can't have
massive layoffs and a &quot;shortage&quot; at the same time, folx.
Someone is fibbing, and I don't think it's the guy
with the pink slip and the contents of his desk in a
cardboard box...
