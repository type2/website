Subject: Oil bath air cleaner pre-heat tube
Date: Mon, 10 Jul 2000 21:31:11 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

So I seem to be missing a hole in my engine tin for the tube that goes from
my oil bath air cleaner - I'm inclined to just drill a hole, I'd guess its
roughly 1 inch.  Does this seem right, that is, that my tin could be missing
a hole?  And is there anything to be concerned about re drilling through the
tin?

TIA
