Subject: '66 L360 blues?
Date: Thu, 20 Apr 2000 17:22:23 -0700
Organization: 
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

i stopped by the local paint supplier today to see if they could identify the formula for L360 sea blue. the &quot; great computer&quot; found
two L360s.
L360 (original) was used from '58-'66. the L360 #2 was used from '61-'67.
the actual formulas are a little different.( more of this,  none of that etc.) is anybody familiar with real difference (color tone)
between these two blues?
