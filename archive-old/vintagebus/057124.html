&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; Matt,
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt;    I've sold a few things on E-Bay. My tips,
&gt; FWIW...
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; Look at other car ads first. If a car appeals to
&gt; you, copy their style 
&gt; and
&gt;  &gt; wording. Folksy, factual, optimistic, father-son,
&gt; nostalgic. Use a theme 
&gt; if
&gt;  &gt; it appeals to you.
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; Get really good pictures even if it's in primer.
&gt; Take it to a ritzy part 
&gt; of
&gt;  &gt; town and put it in front of a nice house or a
&gt; park. Flip 'em $10 if they 
&gt; let
&gt;  &gt; you park it on the lawn. If you know someone who
&gt; can modify the picture 
&gt; and
&gt;  &gt; apply digital paint and a few sparkles IN
&gt; ADDITION to the real pictures.
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; Place your ad to end on a Saturday or Sunday
&gt; evening. You'll have more 
&gt; last
&gt;  &gt; minute bidders if they can be at their computers.
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; Give a phone number and be ready to answer, give
&gt; available times. Some 
&gt; like
&gt;  &gt; to hear a voice and ask a few questions.
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; Be honest! Expose all the negative in the ad.
&gt; Estimate the effort/cost to
&gt;  &gt; fix the problems.
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; Set a realistic beginning price, not something
&gt; stupid like one cent.
&gt;  &gt; Reserve? I like to set my starting bid at the
&gt; lowest price I'll take. 
&gt; Don't
&gt;  &gt; set a reserve if you want to get rid of it and
&gt; think that the low price 
&gt; is
&gt;  &gt; fair. Hard to say, look at other ads and see if
&gt; you like the &quot;deal&quot; and 
&gt; make
&gt;  &gt; your decision.
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt;   Hope it helps
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt;        -Harry in Fresno
