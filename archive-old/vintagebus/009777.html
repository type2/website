Subject: What's in your garage?

It's finally friday and I'd like to pursue the topic I proposed a couple of
days ago.
Namely &quot;What's in your garage?&quot; Based on my own experience, I realized long
ago that my garage will probably never hold my &quot;daily driver&quot;. In my garage
now resides the following:
A 1961 ragtop beetle &quot;off the pan&quot; on the right side, with the beetle pan on
the left side.
Piled on top of that, two aftermarket floor pans, two complete sets of
engine tin for a 1500, three 6V starters, and various other engine parts.
Between the beetle and it's pan sit an air compressor, oxy-acatelyne welding
set up and a mig welder.
To round out the clutter, there's various lawn chairs, a dog cage, gas cans
and at least three trash bags full of crushed beer cans waiting to be cashed
in.
In the driveway, sits my '66 Westy along with a '64 beetle convertible
(non-runner) and an '81 rabbit convertible (son's daily driver).
My wife's has long ago given up the idea of parking anywhere but on the
street.
John
