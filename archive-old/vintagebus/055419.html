&gt;on a 67 bus, what is the function of the small toggle switch on or near the steering column, closest to the signal switch. it's
&gt;very small and toggles up and down, if that is any help.

I never did figure that one out, I tried it in the dark one time and
lights were flashing on and off over my head, (so i don't do it any more *~*
