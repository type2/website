hm- annoying.  If putting that back did not help, I would run through the 
tune up procedure again, just to make sure.  No rags stuck in the fan?       
no vacuum leaks?  no holes in the fresh air tubes or junctions?  Fan belt 
adjusted right?

also check to make sure it is running on 4 cylinders.  may need new plug 
wires- look for cracks or if they are old and crunchy.

&gt;  &gt; put the flat spot back. where it was.  It is very important to have a 
flat
&gt;  &gt; spot on an engine with a 009.  The factory installed those spotsin the 
&gt; dist
&gt;  &gt; for a reason.- to keep the engine cool.  they let the heat out through a
&gt;  &gt; wormhole into space.  so it has to be adjusted properly or the heat will 
&gt; stay
&gt;  &gt; in the motor.
