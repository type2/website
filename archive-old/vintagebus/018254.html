To the friendly and knowledgeable list members,

Does anyone remember a web site from a self described vw junk yard?
It had a &quot;girl with broke down bus puts in a new engine&quot; story
and a two battery &quot;how to' article. stuff like that.
I also had links to stories about bus trips to Costa Rica.
I think maybe they were shut down by VWofA's lawyers
I miss the site for it's humor and real world tips.

Aloha

Ken
