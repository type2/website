&lt;&lt; The '57 one looks a little different than the others. There is a kind of 
&quot;star&quot; design around the lugnut holes. Anyone ever noticed the differences in 
the 15 inch wheels? &gt;&gt;
Hi Rex,
Yup!  We call those crows feet.  They reinforce the area right around the lug 
bolt holes.  Seems to have been a design manufactured from about 1955-59 for 
VW.  We have found a 1956 or 57 rim from another manufacture that does not 
have the crows feet reinforcements.  Eric&amp;Barb
