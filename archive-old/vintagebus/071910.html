&lt;&lt; Brilliant me just realized I don't have a sway bar on the front of my '65. 
 Not even a stock one.  Or did they have them in '65?
 Anyone using an aftermarket one on theirs &amp; care to recommend maker &amp; 
vendor?&gt;&gt;
 ..................................

no, a 65 probably wouldn't have on, they in stalled them as of 66.  
You can take one from a 66 or 67 bus and put it on your 65.  That's what I've 
been meaning to do for a few years.
