Subject: Re: [VB] no power in 4th

&gt;So it seems to run fine until I get to 4th gear. When I get to 4th it 
&gt;just doesn't seem to have any power for some reason.  [...]  I havn't
&gt;adjusted the carb yet, or even set the timing.  Also havn't changed
&gt;the fuel filter or the plugs or the points yet.

Change the fuel filter, plugs, points and condenser, adjust the dwell,
and time it.  I know from experience that a failing condenser or (even
more so) dwell set too low will kill power.  It'll start and idle
just fine, but when you really need the juice, it just isn't there. 

&gt;So I'm thinking the carb is running lean. Sound like it might be 
&gt;right?

It could be, but I would try to make the ignition system as right as
you can make it before adjusting the carb much.  The carb can be
delivering the perfect mixture to the cylinders but if there's a weak
spark or a spark at the wrong time, the mixture won't burn completely
and the engine will lack power.  Both Bentley and Muir advise getting
everything else in order before trying to adjust the carb.

&gt;Has a 1989 date on it.

Where do you see this?  I am trying to establish a date for the carb
from my Bus and I'm not sure which of several marks might be a date
code, if any.
