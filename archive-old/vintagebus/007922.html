Well I don't know where everyone got the idea that the cylinder bores in the
case are oversized.  I never said that.  I'll go out to the shop right now
and take measurements of the following:

Cylinder bores in the case, cylinder diameter at the bottom, cylinder
diameter at the top, and the cylinder bore in the heads and BRB.

9:49p.m. CST.........

10:02p.m. CST

Okay Volks, here's the latest measurements:

Cylinder case bores:

#1 - 96mm
#2 - 96mm
#3 - 96mm
#4 - 96mm

Cylinder Dia. at the bottom:

#1 - 95.9mm
#2 - 95.8mm
#3 - 96.0mm
#4 - 96.0mm

Cylinder Dia. at the top:

#1 - 98.0mm
#2 - 98.0mm
#3 - 98.03mm
#4 - 98.01mm

Cylinder Bore in the heads:

#1 - 99.3mm
#2 - 98.8mm
#3 - 98.7 - 98.8mm
#4 - 98.7 - 98.8mm

Piston and Cylinder sets are stamped 90.43mm

Tell me I need to spend more money on this project.
