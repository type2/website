Subject: [VB] Increasing the accuracy of my digitcal scale. (weighing rods)

Somewhere in the deep fathoms of my mind, I recall a method that one can use
to increase the accuracy of a scale.  Since my digital scale measures down
to tenths of an ounce (2.8g) and I need to be able to balance down to around
.5g to 1g, I needed a way to weigh my parts with the scale I have.  I asked
my brother about it and within short order, he did the math and came up with
a way I can really weigh my parts accurately with the scale I have.

In order for the method to work, I would need to have my scale be able to
measure upwards of 7 pounds which won't work because the limit is 4.
However, if the scale is overloaded and then the weight gradually removed,
one can in effect weigh larger items from the top down by pulling up on the
object instead of letting gravity pull it down.  Using a lever with a 6:1
ratio, I should be able to get my rods weighed together really close.  I've
uploaded a scan of the original picture to
http://home.ispi_dot_net/bie/elassley/scalehack.jpg that my brother drew
explainging it all out.  Thought you all might like to see it.
