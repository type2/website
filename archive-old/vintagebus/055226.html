&gt;Was hosing out the front of my '66 Riviera. Under the floor mat, around the
&gt;shifter, hand brake and steering column were cleanly and accurately cut
&gt;vinyl pieces to act as gaskets about 2&quot; around the holes. They have an open
&gt;plaid pattern, haven't cleaned them up yet. Anybody see these on other
&gt;Rivieras?

Hey Harry,

Can't say I have those on my '63 Riviera.  I just went out and took a 
peek.  I had to go out there anyway and get rid of the glass that was once 
my fog lamp...I hate people who try to parallel park in front of an 
apartment complex.  This is the 2nd set of old lamps I've gone thru this 
year!  I'm just taking them off until I buy a house!!
