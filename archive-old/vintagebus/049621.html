Subject: photoshop whiz needed - BUS CONTENT! :)

Anyone out there a genius on photoshop? I have a scan of a cooooool
accessory: a sticker that overlays the speedo, showing shift points for the
various models in various colors. I THINK it was an official VW item.
Anyways, the scan has some problems, and I would like to clean it up, but
am strictly a cut and paste man. I eventually want to get this to where you
can download the file from the net, take it to a copy shop and print it out
on clear acetate at the proper size... viola, cool speed item fer cheap!
