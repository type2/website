Another email from Bentley regarding the manuals &amp; years

----- Forwarded message from stan.wohlfarth_at_bentleypublishers_dot_com -----

When we do these vintage reprints of VW workshop manuals we usually try to
cover the same chunks (model years) that the factory covered with the
various editions. Trying to combine various chunks can be difficult and
usually requires some significant editorial time to figure out what should
be included. We also feel that remaining faithful to what the factory
originally did with these manuals is the best way to reproduce the
information accurately. I suspect that May of '59 would be when the bus got
upgraded to the 36hp motor and therefore a whole new manual was put out by
the factory, correct me if I'm wrong on this.

The reason I put a May 1959 start date on the book is because that is where
the '59-'63 transporter workshop manual that we have starts. I determined
this from the technical data section at the back of the manual.

If you wanted to let me take a look at the '53/'54 and '55 manuals that
would be a good starting point. I could provide you with our FedEx account
number to have you ship them to me here:

By the way, I bookmarked your site to go back and check it out some more in
the future. I especially liked the various pictures of hulks and hack jobs.
I also think it is great that you provide people with the color wiring
diagrams as I have been wanting to do the same thing on our website but just
haven't gotten around to it.

Just so you know, I'm a late model bus enthusiast from way back in the early
days of LiMBO (Late Model Bus Organization, international) and am very
familiar with NEATO and know Tom Brouilette pretty well. LiMBO was modeled
after them back when they were actually headquarted here in the Northeast.
Every fall, with the help of George Bossart of NEATO I put on the
Transporterfest event up here at a local transportation museum in Brookline,
MA. We only get about 10 or less pre-'67 buses as there just aren't that
many around up this way. I've never owned a 'split' but do have a restored
'81 Westfalia, an '87 Syncro and recently spent some time restoring an '87
Golf. It probably sounds weird to you west-coasters that we east-coasters
restore vehicles from the '80s but that's the nature of the rust/cold
weather game here. Just thought you might like a little background to help
you know who I am.

Also, we (Bentley) have been out to the VW Classic in Irvine, CA the last
few years and are planning to be there this year. Do you ever get to that
show, or the OCTO bus event on the Saturday?
