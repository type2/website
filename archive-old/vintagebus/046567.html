&lt;&lt; I am curious, though, as to why you say it is necessary to have some
positive air pressure to the heater boxes all the time... since it is for the
most part completely sealed off when the heater is not operational (heater
flaps closed), which would seem to negate the idea of air actually flowing
through there.  &gt;&gt;
Hi Jason,
Well do you have a fresh air heat exchanger laying around?  Okay if you do get
it out and look at it while you read the directions we will now give you.
First Look at the heater box and figure out which is the forward end.  Then
look at the snout like tube that the heated air is pushed out into the VW.
Now look at the backside of this forward end and you will see a kind of cap
with the bottom side of this having a slit.  Now on top of this forward end is
a area of sheet metal that is attached to the heater control arm that the
heater cable and clamp are inserted to make the heater work.  Bend back the
sheet metal tabs of this area until you can remove this area.  Once you get
this area out you will find that you have the heater box flaps.  Notice we
said &quot;flaps&quot; as in two, which there are.  Look into the opening in the heater
box that you just made by removing the heater flaps.  See the inside of the
forward heater outlet that goes to you VW?  Now look at the oppisite area
toward the back inside there.  See that round opening that goes to the cap
with the slit in the bottom.  If you take a flashlight and shine it outside
and/or inside there you will see the light go through the slit.  This is the
way that the heater boxes cool themselfs during the times that you have the
heater system to the interior of your VW shut off.     Eric &amp; Barb
