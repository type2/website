Not to be too picky but you also left out financing cost.  Even at the 
$11,780 cost of the cheaper of the two the average person will probably 
finance the purchase.  This would make the total cost of the cars somewhere 
around 125% - 150% of what is listed.  Also, insurance is going to be higher 
on a new car and I'm guessing the average Joe doesn't have a diagnostic 
computer to work on either of these critters so figure in the higher repair 
costs as well.  

Damn, busses are sounding better and better all the time.  Maybe I should run 
out and get a couple more while I can.  Now just why is it people are 
complaining about the &quot;high&quot; cost of busses?
