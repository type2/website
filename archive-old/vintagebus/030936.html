Here's some info I saved that Bob Hoover posted to RAMVA back in June
2000:

&quot;In 1991 or '92 VW de Mexico abandoned carburetors for single-port fuel
injection.  Aircooled engines built for domestic use (i.e., in Mexico)
use dished pistons to drop the CR to 6.8:1, allowing them to run on
Pemex 'Xtra' (their version of regular gas; and yes, the octane is
pretty low).

Temperature control is managed by the system's onboard computer, which
reduces the injector on-time.  VW de Mexico never built any air-cooled
buses and Mexican-built Beetles are lighter in weight than their German
cousins.  De-tuned and only mildly stressed, waste-heat management on
the 45hp engines has never been an issue.

SOP for use of an engine from the Puebla plant with a carburetor is to
install the missing stud for the thermostat bracket.&quot;

&gt; I don't know if they are using VW fanshrouds, but I'd assume that the new
&gt; Mexican ones don't have flaps, or have some sort of fixed air directers.
&gt; In mild climates (like Mexico) you can get away without flaps with little
&gt; effect but long warmups (which VW de Mexico remedies with the fuel
&gt; injection)  In the cold country your engine will run seriously
&gt; under temperature.  This is not good for engine life.  If you make a long
&gt; highway run and you're able to hold your hand against the case without
&gt; discomfort you either have a high pain tolerance or your engine is running
&gt; too cold.
