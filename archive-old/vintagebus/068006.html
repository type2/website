I picked up an NOS German VW split bus driver's side
door at OCTO. Seller found it in the rafters at a VW
shop in Thailand.

Anyway, it's part number 214 831 051 A 

It matched all the holes, etc. of my 67 driver's door,
but there was no hole for the rear mount of the
outside door handle. There was, however a flat area
for the rear handle mount to sit against. So, I'm
figuring they just didn't drill that hole? Maybe so
earlier handles could be used.
Check out the pics at the link below, what do you
think?
