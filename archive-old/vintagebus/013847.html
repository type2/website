Subject: [VB] cleaning out the new bus
Message-ID: &lt;19991103000614.56822.qmail_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt;

Hello listmembers,

I have been lurking in the shadows of the VB list dreaming of one day owning 
a bus myself.  This past weekend I found a &quot;rolling shell&quot; former SO-35 1964 
bus with a straight body and minimal rust.  The rust is in the usual spots, 
and the PO had panels cut from a donor bus to replace all the rusty spots.  
When I get those panels in someday, the bus will be pretty buch rust free.  
My plan of attack is the following:

1.  rip out super nasty red velvet covered interior panels and carpet. (no 
joke)
2.  Remove window glass (the seals are pretty much toast, and I will need to 
replace them eventually, I figure)
3.  Wash the entire bus inside and out, underbody too.  Then I can get a 
better idea of what to do next, and be a little bit less messy 
(theoretically) doing it.

My question(s) is this:  should I remove the speedo, or the fuel gauge 
before washing out the interior?  Are there any other things that cannot get 
wet?  There is no engine in the bus, but the tranny looks good.  I am 
planning on putting a garbage bag over the tranny bell, and fastening with a 
bungee cord before I start washing so that I don't get water in the tranny.  
Are there any other potential points of entry, or things I need to look at 
for?  Let me know if there is something else I should do first, I am 
planning on re-doing just about everything (wiring, brake lines &amp; mc, etc.) 
eventually.  Where to begin...

TIA,

Mike Anderson
