&gt; I was down at the city dump today, and what did I find?  A totally cherry 1969 Camaro! The problem is though, I've got this brand-new 36 horse-power fire breather... I would like to adapt this engine to my new Camaro, but don't quite know how exactly yet.  
&gt;
I've seen this conversion only once.  I met up with the owner of the conversion at this years VW Classic.  Perhaps you saw it, it was parked 2 cars away from the &quot;sex-show&quot; Double Cab?

His conversion required no reinforcement of any kind, just a custom torque multipler between the 36hp flywheel and a Powerglide tranny.  He also had taken the liberty of installing an NOS Judson supercharger kit and a turbo charger.  I question how both of those could work in tandem, especially using a 28 PCI carb., but he produced a dynometer print-out that showed his 36hp engine could produce 300 road hp at 2500 rpms with an astounding 400 ft. lbs. of torque.  A custom-fabricated fiberglass hood scoop provided ram air into the Judson and cooled the turbocharger.  Also, it ran on tap water and even the manual choke was functional!

He brought detailed schematics of how to mill the torque multiplier for under $50, how to build a 300 hp 36hp engine for around $500 using modified NOS parts, and how to convert a common VW engine to run on filtered tap water.  Unfortunately, the plans were stolen out of my unlocked Bus 10 minutes later.

I did have his cell phone # but I think it has been changed as he mentioned several times how the &quot;oil companies were after him&quot; and something about a &quot;contract on his life.&quot;  I did have an eerie feeling we were being watched.

Sorry, I couldn't provide much help.  Good luck in your attempts.  Shame to ruin a good Camaro, though.  It wasn't red, was it?  I think that was my uncle-in-laws car, it was just stolen.
