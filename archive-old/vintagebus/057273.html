I have some valve covers and misc. tin with the 40 years of road gunk/oil/dirt and whatever else. They are straight and from the small areas I have cleaned off the paint is still intact. What is the best way to clean off the gunk without screwing up the paint....   I'm not looking for a miracle/mystery product just a way to do it. What kind of degreaser? What method?

If there is no reasonable way and I go sandblast them, do I need to use high temp paint? I've never painted valve covers before... do they get hotter the engine tin? I know I should powder coat them but....



Thanks,

Brian
