Subject: RE: [VB] M/C on '67

I bit the bullet on mine and upgraded to the larger 24mm piston 71-79 style
master cylinder with an adapter kit from local VW store. BFY or I, whatever,
out of the VW Trends and Hot VW mags sells the adaptr kit for $39.95. I
bought the new master cylinder for $43.00 and had it all bolted in my SC in
20 minutes. The brake lines on my dual circuit 67 matched exactly with the
new master cylinder and the only other change was to lengthen the wires the
the farthest brake light switch. I even took pics, go to vintagebus_dot_com and
click on the gallery and the single cab catagory and my master cylinder mod
pictures are on section 5 about the middle of the page. Good luck.

There is a west coast supplier that puts one of the ATEs on eB*y from
time to time.  The last one I noticed sold 2 weeks ago for $150.

As for rebuilt MCs, FWIW some have opined in the past that a rebuilt MC
can lose some of its stopping power and/or safety once the barrel is
honed, and should be avoided if possible.  But I imagine that lots have
done it without a problem, as well.

&gt; It looks like there is a slow leak on the master cylinder in my '67.  I
just
&gt; did a quickie on-line price check.
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;GULP&gt; $175.
&gt; 
&gt; I realize it is a 'one year only' item and unless I dont want to stop I
&gt; really dont have much of a choice in the matter.  Has anybody else out
there
&gt; seen them cheaper?? How about a rebuilt one??
