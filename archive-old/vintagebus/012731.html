Anybody out there have an original '66 owners manual?  What does it say about
towing -- how much weight can it tow in the flatlands of Florida?  I know the
bus will haul around 1 ton on its own, but can it pull, say, a small car for a
distance of ... well if it can tow this, what distance would you recommend?
(Or should I not do this at all?)

The bus will have a full flow oil setup - about the only unstock thing on the
bus.

Sorry about playing the 1000 questions game but I know I'll get some pretty
good stuff from yous guys on the list

Paul

66 21
71 Super (which pulled the 66 a short distance and got laughed off of the
street..)
