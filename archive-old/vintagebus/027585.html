 As far as quality of rubber, I'm not all that impressed with German
rubber.
  Fuel lines that I replace every two years generally have cracks in
their
 ends, where the SAE lines I put in my C*evy 5 years ago look fine.

I went to my local Aeroquip shop and found some hose that is high
quality neoprene with a SS braid inside and a cloth cover. Have to cut
it with a hacksaw or cutoff saw and it can be used with hose clamps.  It
cost around $2/foot (probably $4 these days).  It's been on the vehicle
for 20 years with over 200,000 miles and still going strong.  The end
near the carb, which is actually about 6&quot; from the carb, has minor
cracks at the very end, but is still flexible. I have used the same
stuff for oil, trans, heater &amp; P/S cooler lines and have never had a
failure.  The ends at the engine crack and get stiff from the heat, so I
just trim a little off the end when needed. Personally, I wouldn't use
any hose that has &quot;fuel&quot; on it, although I carry some for road repairs
'cause it can be cut with a knife.
