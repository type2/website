Subject: Re: fleetlines [VB] 10 digit serial number

fig writ: 

The VINs on Fleetlines (note this name applies only to these
75 Brazilian splits, and not any other)
........

 I've seen some ads on the samaba for fleetlines recently, that were in africa and they seem to be 74s or 75s, ya a 15 window '74 splitty in south africa.  http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/classifieds/index.mv?photo+200311042310221141

 So some were made in africa in 74? too.   and then in 76 in brazil they went to the hybrid bay nose on a splitty body with the high hinge barndoor style but sturdy and reinforced cargo doors?  how long were those made?     

//////////////
do not follow the
usual German pattern. All the Fleetlines I've seen have VINs
starting with 205 (maybe signifying type 2, RHD???), with
the fourth digit signifying the model, the 3 in your case
signifies a Kombi. Panelvan would be 1 and pick-up
(wide-body single cab) 6. 
.............
odd, on the german production the second digit gives the model (truck or combi etc), not the 4th digit.   

///////////////
The rest of the numbers are
sequential production numbers, so your Kombi was probably
number 155 of 789.

&gt; This is probably a better explanation of the first three
&gt; digits than mine in my earlier mail!\

well, I was just going from the vins I'm used to, but that second digit, well I'm guessing  

but you knew the 4th digit indentifies the model (wierd)! 

Once I saw this odd book written by a guy who had extensively travelled the world.     He loved VWs, all kinds, and noticed how diff countries had different specs and models.  It was from bugs through new cars, and the air cooled section was small.   really neat book, I should have bought it.   Lots of pictures.
