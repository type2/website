Subject: Use of '68-70 brake parts on a splitty

Hey All, 

  I picked up a decent set of front brake drums a couple weeks ago and I was wanting to use them on my bus!

  Here is my problem:

  The drums are '68-70 bus and I have a '67 bus!

  I was told that some sort of spacer is required.  Does anyone know what I am talking about, where exactly I am supposed to put the spacer  AND where I can get that spacer?

ALSO, what is the compatibility of backing plates from a '68-70 to a splitty?

THANKS

-Roger N.
