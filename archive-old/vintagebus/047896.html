     after my radio shorted out about a week ago.. i started hearing i noise 
that was not there before...
 it is in the trans because it stops the second i put in the clutch. the 
noise is a sort of high pitched humm that starts when i put it in third grear 
and accelerate. if i stop accelerating the noise ceases. it continues into 
fourth gear until about 55mph where it dissapears.. could this be a gear 
problem in the transaxle? a CV joint or reduction box problem.. 

any help would be appreciated..

trannys do sometimes humm, whine, or make a rythmic pulsating noise.      My 
69 type 1 has had a slight tranny whine (no one else seems to notice it but 
me) from about 45-55 in 3rd gear for the past 8 years.    I am not saying it 
is good, I am just saying it may not be anything to worry about unless you 
find it a high annoyance factor.   Then again, changing the gear oil 
(including RGBox oil) yearly (or 10 K mi) helps.  Main bearing?
