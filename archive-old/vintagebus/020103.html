That's kind of what I was thinking, the popping out of gear startled me.  But
I'm more than willing to assume that _I_ screwed up something somewhere, and if
that _can_ cause these problems (except for fourth gear howl :-P), is there
anything I can do to eliminate them?  Could it be that I have the shifter
adjusted incorrectly?  Etc.

Ordinarily I wouldn't be quite so insistent that it be my fault, but I'm 
pretty sure that's the case.  I'm quite absent minded (ask anyone :-)) so maybe
I missed something.  I also don't want to pull the engine/tranny out again as
this is seriously becoming a weekly ordeal, so I want to be _sure_.  If I'm
sure, I'll call the rebuilder (who I've never heard complaints about, except
leaky RGBs, another reason for my uncertainty) who will more than likely be
happy to help me out.

I don't want to pull everything apart again, but I don't want my tranny to
crap out in 20K miles either.  So I'll do it if I need to.
