Subject: Toe-In adjustment,difficult?
References: &lt;199806251124.EAA28345_at_yiff.azaccess_dot_com&gt;

    I'm in the process of going over my recently aquired '67 Westy and
am trying to get the steering adjustment just right, it supposedly came
with a rebuilt steering box, but the oil seal was installed backwards
(spring out) so it leaks and I wonder if the excees play could have
something to do with incorrect shimming on the rebuilt box.

    I also want to check the toe-in adjustment. Is it do-able at home?
Is the Muir book pretty good at explaining this procedure? Any other
tips for tightening up the steering play? The kingpin has also been
redone by a VW mechanic so that shouldn't be the problem. What is normal
play in a good steering system?

                    Thanks - Tim in Minneapolis
