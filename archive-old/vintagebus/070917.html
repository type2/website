Subject: RE: [VB] '56 Single Cab

I've been eyeing at that one for a while now... I wish I could find a one
that nice on the east coast.

...

&gt;&gt;&gt; I was wondering if anybody has ever seen this truck in person:
&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/classifieds/index.mv?photo+20030625231119
&gt;&gt;&gt; 8002
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Nice truck! Still seems priced high, but what do I know?  What was he
&gt;&gt; asking
&gt; before?
&gt;&gt;
&gt; I think $10,000
&gt;

If it's as nice as it looks, it should be worth that to someone? But then
what they are worth &amp; what people will pay for them are not necessarily the
same in the VW world?
