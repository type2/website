Hi Dug,
You might want to check out Dawn &amp; Steve at PLF.  They are making the canvas
tops only for about $700.00.  The top canvas is just like original except two
improvements that we advised them to make to them.  Neither of the
improvements can be seen and improve the drivablity of the top.    Eric &amp; Barb
