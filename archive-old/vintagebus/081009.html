Subject: Wrong voltage regulator

Here's the situation:

I have a 12V 1500 with a GR17 38A generator (which is too long - another 
story*).  I have two VRs -- both say 30A.

So will it fry a 30A VR if I use it with a 38A gen?  Or will it just not 
realize the full output of the gen?

Thanks,
Joe

*The 17-series gen is about .5&quot; longer than the original (15), which means 
the belt pulleys are not in the same plane.  I'm amazed it works, but I 
only noticed it the other day (engine out).  PO either didn't notice or 
didn't care.  I had this happen on another engine when the gen went out, 
but fortunately noticed it and swapped for a GR15.
