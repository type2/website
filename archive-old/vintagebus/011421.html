Thom

Steppenwolf Theatre in Chicago is searchin for a 1960's era VW pick-up or bus.
Ideally the body would not be in good shape. I'm interested in renting,
borrowing or purchasing this vehicle. Engine, gas tank, etc. are not required.

If rented or borrowed it would be needed from August through November. If
purchased it would be needed in early august.

Do you think you could help me at all in locating such an item, or could point
me to someone who can? Any help at all would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you,

Robert McGarvie
