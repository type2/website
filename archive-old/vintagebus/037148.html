Subject: Sticking Throttle Lever on 34 Pict
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hey all!,

Took the 67 westy out for her test drive. New front, rear brakes (everything) 
and front and rear shocks. Also a new accelerator cable. Still need to bleed 
some more, the new shocks are nice but look out! The throttle lever is 
sticking and not returning.

In addition to changing out my accelerator cable I also changed out the lever 
underneath the front floor board. This lever came with (2) holes to attach 
the cable to and I guessed at the lower hole to attach it to rather than 
upper hole on the lever which actually is a few mm closer to the rear of the 
bus, follow? Not sure if this is the reason for the throttle lever not 
returning. 

Needless to say I hate running a cold engine at high revs due to my either my 
gas pedal not returning. Leaf spring under pedal long gone. Or I didn't 
grease my cable enough, thought so the cable did have plenty of kinks.  
Should the cable be taunt ? Do I need a new one? Should I have a spring 
between the end of my accelerator cable and the fan shroud? I currently have 
the shroud that attaches to the fan shroud but should there be a spring to 
help return the cable? The process I did was to pull the cable tight and 
screwed it down. Was this incorrect?  Help!

Thanks for your help.
