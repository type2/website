&lt;&lt; This bus is still 6 volt , should I stay with this setup or change to 12 
volts? &gt;&gt;
Hi Jon,
It really depends on what you want to do with your bus.  If you are going to 
keep it fairly stock then probably 6 volt will be just fine.  With proper 
cleaning and upkeep the 6 volt system will function as well as a 12 volt 
system.  

If you are wanting to install later gauges, tape deck, CDI or other 12 volt 
appliances then converting to 12 volt might be the way to go or you are going 
to have to run some 6 to 12 volt inverters.

If you plan to install a huge mega watt stereo, off road lighting, and/or fog 
lights then you probably would be better off with a 12 volt altenator.
