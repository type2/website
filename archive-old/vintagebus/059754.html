Last month, I parked the bus at the far end of the mall, behind and to the
left of a Ford pick-up. Went into the back of the bus to stow something
away..... and turn around to see my front passenger door kissing the pick-up
right behind the drivers door. The bus had rolled forward and with slight
turn to the right of the front wheels..... No damage to the Ford and the
owner happened to be right there to see it happen. He helped me push the bus
off his truck with no further damage inflicted on either vehicle.

Cost $200 to repair and repaint the door.

What happened.... Had it out of gear and only three notches on the e-brake.
I believe the magic number is 5 notches....

Anyway, always keep it in gear with the e-brake on while parked!

Hey all.  Thought I might share a funny thing that could have been bad.

I started my bus up this afternoon and ran inside to grab something letting
her idle a bit.  When I came back out.........my bus was GONE!
stolen?.......nope.  Seems that I need to pay a little attention to my
Ebrake
