Subject: Jerome Jamboree - best airport?
Message-ID: &lt;378CBC69.D850CADA_at_supernet_dot_net&gt;

After hearing so much about past Jerome Jamborees I'm considering flying
out to this year's (Sept 11-12, right?) event.  My knowledge of AZ is
pretty slim, but looking at MapQuest it appears that Flagstaff is the
closest good-sized city.

Anyone care to recommend airports/cities they've flown to for the event
in the past?  I'll be coming from Florida, if that's of any consequence.

Thanks,
joe
