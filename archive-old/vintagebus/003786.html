Subject: Doormobile window needed?  Who has one?

    A friend of mine daughter has a bay window bus that has the Door 
mobile conversion and she has lost one of the small white/clear bubbles 
that covers the smaller of the tops windows.  Right now she has a old 
diner tray duck taped over the hole and told her that I would ask the 
list if anybody knew of one that could be had? 
    Also this bus has the coolest little stove that is behind the back 
seat of the passengers front seat.  The front seat folds up flush to the 
window and then the stove folds down and makes a broiler and a 2 burner 
stove.  It also had a 3 piece wind screen and the back had compartments 
for chairs that attacked over the storage area on little clamps.  My son 
is at his moms and has the digital otherwise I would have pics but be 
sure that when he gets home I will go and get pictures as it really is 
the coolest set up.  The bus also had some kind of child's cot in the
front that stretched across by 2 poles going between the a and b pillars 
in the front.  And 2 cots in the top.
     Anybody know the conversion that I am speaking of.  Is that the 
original Doormobile?  Did they come with chairs and a chair compartment 
over the engine?  Silverware storage compartments?  What is the stove 
called?  It was way cool!
