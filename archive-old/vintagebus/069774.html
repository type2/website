Subject: voltage drop  

Hello All  I have tried all of the voltage drops that they show in the rags, 
most of them didn't work worth a damn . The best I found was the voltage drop 
that VW used in the golfs,jettas for the inside blower fans . the terminal in 
the middle gives exactly 6 volts. heavy enough even to run a 6 volt gas 
heater. later and have fun  Mark Dearing  Salem Import Service Salem Va
