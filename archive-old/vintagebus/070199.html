Subject: Re: [VB] more engine tin &amp; now alternator question

I also had a carb/alternator interference problem. Running a 34 PICT-3 that
I couldn't get to run right. Tossed it and rebuilt another, but this one fit
perfectly with no problems with the alternator. Looking at the one I tossed
it looked like the linkage had been bent up compared to it's replacement.

 And the carb/alt thing.
&gt; I ran into that an couple of times and one of my solutions was to cut the
neck
&gt; bracket off of a trashed center section and file it smooth.
