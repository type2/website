Howdy from the Heartland,

(I've only sent this post to this particular List, so if you are a member
of another List that might enjoy seeing and participating in the following,
please do us a favor and forward it to those Lists that might find this
&quot;Tour&quot; of interest!  Thanks!)

For those on the List who may not know about the &quot;Return to the Fatherland
'99 Tour&quot;, here's the skinny.  On June 18-20th, 1999 an incredible Vintage
VW show will again be held by Hienz Willi Lotterman in the town of Bad
Camberg (B.C.) in Germany.  Most of the best Vintage VW's from all over
Europe, the &quot;rarest of the rare&quot;,  will be in attendance and Vintage VW
enthusiasts from all over the world will again fly in for the festivities.
The Americans always have a big contingent of fans there, but for obvious
reasons, they rarely bring their own cars.  The event is limited to quality
condition, 1957 and earlier only VW's, with the exception that Bulli Kartei
and the SSVC can bring in their 1967 and earlier Split windshield Busses
for a special Type 2 display.  Like the Olympics, B.C. is only held every
four years.  The rumor is out again that this might be the last Bad Camberg
event that Willi will run, and it certainly will be the last one in this
millenium, so the &quot;Buzz&quot; is that it'll be a whopper!

Bill Collins and the members of &quot;Der Kafer Fahrer&quot;, a Vintage VW Club (a
chapter of the VVWCA) devoted to the &quot;actual use&quot; of old VW's (members are
required to log at least 1500 driven miles each year to qualify) decided to
make this years B.C. event even more special.  In celebration of the fact
that this year is also the 50th anniversary of the first VW's being
offically exported to the USA from VW in Germany, Der Kafer Fahrer (DKF)
decided to send a select group of American owned Vintage VW's back to the
Fatherland on a special &quot;Tour&quot;.  All selected &quot;Tour&quot; cars and their
driver/co-driver teams will tour in a caravan of ancient VW's all the way
across the USA first, from L.A. to New York, then their cars will be
shipped to England where the &quot;Tour&quot; will resume through Europe to the event
at Bad Camberg.  Then the cars will be driven back to England to be shipped
back to the USA for their return home.

The Der Kafer Fahrer Club is a wonderful Vintage VW group that is very
focused on the use of stock, early VW's. If you'd like more info on  this
great group of cars and people, contact Bill Collins at    DKF49VW_at_tiac_dot_net


Since this is a two part &quot;Tour&quot;, split into domestic and international
legs, we are inviting you to come and see the &quot;Tour&quot; as it passes through
an area nearest to you.  Come wave to us as we cruise through, visit us at
one of the many overnight stops, or meet us out on the road and join on the
end of the line and caravan with us for a while!  We'd love to see you, but
please, please, PLEASE show your support by driving a Vintage VW if at all
possible.  Don't worry, almost every car is powered by a 25hp motor, so any
&quot;old&quot; VW should be able to keep up with us!

Some very rare and old Vintage VW's will be out on the road a couple of
weeks from now.  Here's what you'll see actually driving (read: not on a
trailer or on a tow bar):

The owners and co-drivers have been getting these Vintage VW's ready for
many months now.  These cars have been through extensive maintinence
procedures and road testing, and a few were completely restored just for
this occasion.  As with all old VW's, breakdowns can and do sometimes
happen. but this group is very experienced in this kind of long distance
touring and will be as prepared as possible for any eventuallity.  Each
vintage car will be carrying it's own very extensive emergency spare parts
inventory and complete tool kit.  The drivers are well known in vintage VW
circles, and many are incredible mechanics.  If someone has any trouble,
the line pulls over and probably the best vintage &quot;brain pool&quot; around gets
together to diagnose and fix the problem so that we're back on the road in
no time.  In fact, in the past, the occassional roadside repair usually
becomes a gala event that is talked about over beverages for many evenings
to come!

Several VW dealerships along the way have graciously offered to host
receptions and parties for these old rolling examples of VW history on this
return to Germany Tour.  Many VW dealerships have offered to open their
service bays and &quot;lifts&quot; for us to do any maintinence or emergency repairs
on our cars.  For the USA portion of the Tour, VWoA has provided us with a
'99 Eurovan MV to use as a &quot;VW Tour support vehicle&quot;.   The Eurovan will
haul photographers and some of our personal luggage and a few special
tools.  Also, Loren Pearson of WCM fame is providing his 1957 Single-Cab
pick-up truck as a vintage support vehicle that will follow the &quot;Tour&quot; cars
loaded with a complete spare vintage engine and crashbox transmission, and
many of the special and larger tools we might need to use out on the road.

If you live along or near the route and might be able to provide, or direct
us to, assistance in case of a major mechanical problem, please contact me
so we can keep your phone number handy.  Thanks in advance for your
support!

My '55 Deluxe Sunroof Beetle was shipped via enclosed auto transport truck
on Saturday.  It will arrive at the starting point of this adventure out in
Los Angeles on May 2nd or 3rd.  My co-driver Tom Niedernhofer and I will
fly out to L.A. on May 4th to help get all nine cars ready.  We will all
stay onboard the famous old passenger ship, the &quot;Queen Mary&quot; in Long Beach
Harbor on the night of May 5th.

Now, pull our your trusty map or atlas and follow along with us on our

That's the most current update of our schedule for the domestic leg of the
&quot;Return to the Fatherland '99 Tour&quot;.  The next leg begins about 3 weeks

very brief, we'll pick up our cars at Harwich, tour with British vintage
VW's to the north of England, then back down to our car ferry crossing with
British enthusiasts to Holland, then through Holland and Belgium into
Northern Germany, where we'll attend several special private VW
tours/functions at the Karmann Factory Museum at Osnabruck, Hanover and
then on to Wolfsburg, and eventually onward to the best Vintage VW event on
the planet held at Bad Camberg, Germany on June 18-20th.

Well, there you have it, a brief rundown of the schedule for Der Kafer
Fahrer's upcoming &quot;Return to the Fatherland '99 Tour&quot;.  It's been a
privilege to be invited to bring our car on this &quot;Tour&quot;.  You can't begin
to understand the commitment in passion, time and money that each of us
owner/driver teams has put into our old cars and into the arrangements
necessary to be a part of this rolling Vintage VW adventure!  It's a huge
challenge, but one that we'll always look back on as a &quot;once in a lifetime
VW event&quot;.

Wish us luck, cross your fingers for us while we're out there, and we hope
to get to see some of you along our way back to the Fatherland.

Bill Bowman
Der Kafer Fahrer, NEATO, VVWCA, etc.
