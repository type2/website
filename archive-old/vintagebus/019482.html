&gt; I was browsing through the Muir Idiot manual and found that he eliminated his electromagnetic cut-off jet.  Muir claims that VW sold a screw in jet to take its place.  Does anyone know what this PN# is or where to order one?

I don't know about the earlier carbs, but I had one of these go bad on a 
34 PICT-3 once while on the road.  I didn't have a spare for once, so I had
a problem...it didn't run if I left it in there, and naturally it would cause
all sorts of issues if I just left a gaping hole there :-)

I took a wire cutter to the plunger on the cut-off, put it back in, and kept
on driving.  It never ran on for me much, but I still replaced it on the next
tune-up.

I think the ones on earlier carbs were different in their operation...it's 
been a while since I've had one apart.
