Subject: Starter Frustration, AAAARRRRHHHHH

Hey Volks,
Well, I finally for a functional splint on my finger from my cleaning
accident (sshh, don't read that to loud ;0)  I decided to go work on the
'66.  Changed the oil, tune up and all the great things you folks wrote
me to do. I made sure the engine turned freely after 22 years of
sitting. All ready to go, I put the key in and CLICK, nothing.
I climb under the bus to the starter. Use the old screw driver, nothing
just a spark.  Hmmm.. same problem I had with the westy in December.  I
got a new 6 volt starter and was planning to put it in today.  We are in
the middle f exams and I have nothing to do today.  Wife's at work with
the new baby, Casey is at school, The DAY IS MINE!  I laid out all the
tools and climbed under the splittie and admired the solid under
carriage.  Ok , let's get this done I said to myself..  Undid the first
nut after soaking it with rust stuff.  That was easy, now to the engine
compartment.  So far so good.  Then it happened.  The bolt kept spinning
with the nut. No problem, it has happened before on the old '60 panel.
Well after fighting to get a wrench on the head of the bolt for and hour
going through the innards of the bus, I am about to have a fit.  Anyone
have any tips just how to do this?  Thanks
