It is much easier to demonstrate than to explain, but since I am about half
full, I'll give it a go. You need two persons. One, the more experienced, to
hold and pull on the forward edge of the panel and to keep what I call &quot;d!*k
arch&quot; in it. Which is to say, a gentle bend. Hmm. Anyway, keep the arch in
there while your compatriot keeps tapping gently on the rear edge with the
benefit of a block of some sort to spread the pain over a larger area. Guide
that puppy carefully so that it doesn't head towards the fresh air vent and
bind or towards the other side and jump out of the track. If it is moving
along easily, then you have enough arch, if slowly, pop it in the middle to
put some curvature to it. When it gets up to the front tracks, you must move
very slowly and carefully to guide the little rascal into the forward tracks
so as to give it that nice compound curve. If you miss, you are scrod. You
pretty much have to break the panel to get it back out so PAY ATTENTION!!!!!
If I were rich and retired, I would come show you, but I'm not and you
aren't either, so you're on your own.

&gt; does anyone have any tricks for installing the hardboard panels in the
front
&gt; cab section of the bus?
&gt;
&gt; i have been having a hell of a time getting them to fir into all the
&quot;grooves&quot;
&gt; at once (the one that runs along the side of the overhead vent box) and
then
&gt; above the trim panel on the outside.
