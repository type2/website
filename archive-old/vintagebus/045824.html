Hi Volks,
Also shorts like this will burn out the alternator which is more prone to 
this type of damage than old fashioned generators.  Could be just a bad 
ground cable.  We have know several volks who replaced thier battery, 
gen/alternator, and starter only to find out it was a bad battery/body ground 
cable!  So best to clean up your bus wiring and check everthing for 
conductivity/resistance.   Eric&amp;Barb
