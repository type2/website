Hi John,
Well then it is time to get a welder and do some patching.  If you have a 
bench seat bus hanging a see through or not curtain behind the front seats 
works wonders.   Also investing in long johns will help her in or outside of 
the bus!  For smaller/shorter volks the usual store bought long johns will 
probably work.  For those who are taller more muscular, military surplus ones 
are the only way to go!  Eric&amp;Barb
