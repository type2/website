&gt; &gt;I simply sprayed POR15 clear on all inside panels during the restoration.
&gt; &gt;It is a non-porous coating - nothing will get thru from that side. Then I
&gt; &gt;just stuck in some fresh new R21 insulation pillows and jammed the panels
&gt; &gt;back on.

I did not ever use insulation in the front doors - too much actual water
going thru.  My new solution for this is POR15 painted on the backsides
and edges of the new WW replacement panels.
