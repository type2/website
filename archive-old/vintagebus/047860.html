In a message dated 98-12-09 00:39:23 EST, you write:

&lt;&lt; Is it possible for me to remove the entire 2 rod section out the rear?
 (even if it means complete removal of the tranny)  Drilling this coupling
 (which sits off to the side, even with the rod turned as far as it would
 go...although, now that I think about it, with the shifter out, it might
 turn further...) precisly wont be easy, if even possible (frame members in
 close proximity. &gt;&gt;
Hi David,
You can not remove the two shift rod pieces due to the forward piece having
two bends in it that would prevent it from sliding through the rear tube.  You
are going to have to dissassemble the stick shift and see how much farther you
can move the shift rods and solid front coupler forward to allow you more
access to drill out the broken bolt in the coupler.  You might want to look
for one of those 90 degree drill bit converter tools that will allow you to
drill in tighter places.  Be carefull to not drill to deep into the rear shift
rod or you will have to remove the engine/tranny to get the rear shift rod out
to replace or weld, grind, and redrill the tapered set bolt hole in the end of
the rear shift rod.  Been there done that, on our 1960 panel camper!!!  Make
sure you grease the snot out of all your threaded parts when reassembling to
prevent rust and stuck/broken fasteners later.   Eric &amp; Barb
