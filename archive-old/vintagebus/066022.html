Subject: Re: [VB] Any Experience with Tom Buese &amp; his canvas?

Tom donated a SC canvas to this past year's raffle bus for Jerome Jamboree.  
We never got a set of hoops for it so we never were able to install the 
canvas.  It was raffled with the SC so the new owner got it.  I saw the truck 
just last weekend at a local Phoenix area show.  The new owner has acquired a 
set of hoops and has installed the canvas.  It looks great.  The fit seemed 
perfect: a bit loose so that when it gets some weather (it could happen in 
Phoenix) it should shrink just right.  I have limited experience with 'tilts' 
and this was my first (but not last) dealing with Tom.  When the time comes 
to put a tilt on my DC, I'll be calling him.  He's got my recomendation, for 
what anyone thinks that is worth.
