Try ebay - there's been several sets of NOS for auction lately.  I had a set
of NOS ones, but I &quot;spent&quot; them on the '55, and I still need a set for
the '54.

&gt; I have been looking for a picture of the SWF sticker that is on original
&gt; semaphores. If someone out there could take me a good picture (or scan) of
&gt; what one looks like, and what it says exactly, I would greatly appreciate
&gt; it.  Also if you could put something in the picture to reference size (like
&gt; a ruler, quarter etc...), that would help a bunch.  I am in the process of
&gt; restoring some semaphores, and want to reproduce the SWF stickers that go on
&gt; them.
