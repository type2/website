 &gt; bottom line is get a
 &gt; tach on it, and see where 3K rpms is, use that as your cruising speed.  
 if you can only cruise at 3000 rpm safley in your bus, something is
 wrong with your motor.  i always cruised my bus at 3600-3750 with no
 trouble.
 
 a properly built stock engine should be  able to cruise just under 4000
 rpm all day long.  if it wants to run way hot from doing this, talk to
 your rebuilder.  in 115 degree heat, i would get my 66 westy up to 240
 (which is still a bit too toasty for me) after running 3800 rpm on the
 freeway.  but, for that kind of outside air temp, i'll take it.
 
 get those rpm's up so you can get your fan pushing out more pressure.
 
 but hey, different strokes for different folks.  i personally prefer my
 engine to always be driving between 3 and 4 K. unless idling of course.

i think this discussion has been done for some time before, check the 
archives if you doubt it.

please do realise that though the fan does go faster at higher rpms, the heat 
produced goes up at a non linear rate, thus there is a best cooling rpm.  to 
fin this for your particular VW, you must have guages.    I did ask people to 
post their findings on this at one point, and didn't get much back.  I hoped 
for some sort of tabular format, with outside temp, and humidity, and engine 
temp (where is sender?) at various rpms, taken on the flat after running at 
that rpm long enough for the temp to stabilise.  Hopefully also what size 
motor and what kind of cooler.

Anecdotal evidence is nice, but hardly enough.
