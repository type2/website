Hey NQ,...NO!  That was me!  Eric and Barb were on the
'other side' of that once heated discussion way
backkkk, they loved the freeway stuff and their buddy
Todd from olympia that tranny scammer dude.

NQ, I do recall we 'shared' some heated views also ;) 
You had just got the freeway flyer and really seemed
to like it at the time.

I am glad to see most of the folks that told me I was
'nutz' to stay stock and listen to vw themselves are
now recanting of sorts! :-)

I always said the freeway flyer stuff is ok if you got
the big horses to do it...otherwise go stock.

tds

&gt; Anyway, I'd like to see the list pretty much agree
&gt; on telling anyone from
&gt; this point on no to run the flyer unless you have at
&gt; least a 1900cc+ engine
&gt; to pull it.  I kind of wished that I had left my
&gt; trans stock and ran tall
&gt; tires like I had been repeatedly told by one of the
&gt; listees (I think it was
&gt; Eric and Barb) but not for sure.
