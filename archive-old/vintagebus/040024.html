Hi everyone,
   I'm new to the list...I used to be on the old list before it split the 
two different lists...

  Anyway I have a panel van and I can't tell whether it is a 59 or 60 model 
year.  I bought it from the widow of the original owner (who is having 
trouble finding the title).  She thinks it was a 59 but the VIN number on 
the tag in the engine compartment and behind the seat ends in 0.  The 
&quot;birthdate&quot; is 1SEP59 according to the M tag.

  Is there anyway to tell the difference between model years other than the 
little stamped tags?

  A little background on me:  This is my first split window bus, I have 
owned beetles, bay windows, Things, squarebacks, 412's, and Ghia's.  Right 
now I work for Volkswagen here in Northern VA.  From 1998-2000 I was the 
General Manager at The Thing Shop in Chandler, AZ.  Prior to that I worked 
in a VW Repair shop in VA.

  If any of you have any questions about Things (type 181) feel free to 
direct e-mail me.  I have more knowledge about That car than one man can 
possibly need.

Thanks,
Mike Beggs
