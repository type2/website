Normally, I'd agree with ya, but I have evidence to the contrary:

* this was an area that I did some body work over previously crappy bodywork
* it's the *only* spot on the whole bus with the issue
* my compressor is 5+hp, 90 gallon
* I have a Sharpe air drier, with 25' of hose coiled in a bucket of water
ahead of the drier.  
* I drained the tank and drier before and after the paint job; a little water
before the paint; hardly anything after.
* the compressor is big enuf that it doesn't have to work that much, especially
during painting, when it hardly runs at all.

and now it's trying to get out. (*sigh*)
