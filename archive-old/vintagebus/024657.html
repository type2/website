Subject: coughing/missing

Recently I've been having this problem with my engine.  When I ease into the
gas it is fine, but if I need to give it more it seems like it's missing or
not getting gas.  I checked the points and timing and they're fine.  I
replaced the fuel pump and still the same.  I think it might be the carb. 
Any thoughts?
