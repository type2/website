Subject: [VB] Aligning the Clutch Pressure &amp; Release Plate

I apologize for so many posts on this subject, but I'm going crazy here...
Feels like everyone is speaking a different language and I have yet to
understand a few things about my chattering clutch problem.

Clymer's manual says a chattering clutch can mean a misaligned pressure
and/or release plate. Since I was replacing all the clutch parts, I just
un-bolted the old PP, removed the disc (AKA release plate?), and
re-installed the new parts.
I was sent a wooden alignment tool, is this tool only to align the disc over
the gland nut opening?
And *most* importantly do the pressure plate and disc have to be placed in a
certain position on the flywheel?
Some of my manuals mention lining up the heavy side of the parts to the
paint mark on the flywheel. When I installed the clutch, my only concern was
centering the disc hub over the gland nut so the axle would slide through
them both evenly. I paid no attention to the position of the PP, I aligned
the bolt holes and installed.
I really think this has to be my problem now, but I see no signs of
alignment marks on either the flywheel, PP, or disc.

One last question:

My old disc was completely worn out on the pressure plate side, while the
flywheel side was like new. What does this ussually indicate?

Tom
