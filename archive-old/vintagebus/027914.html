Hello John,

I'm in the same boat... not only painting a '66 camper  for the first time like you, but also thinking of mouse grey/pearl white 2-toned like you. I found a link with lots of discussions on spray painting:

http://www.autobodystore_dot_com/cgi-bin/config.pl?index

They have an archive as well for some researching. Hope that helps. Do post the end result when you get a chance, I'd love to see it

&gt; Howdy Folks,
&gt; Tonight I attempt painting my new '66 camper.  I have NEVER painted a car before, but then again there are lots of things I had previously never done before owning 3 air-cooled VW's.  Plus I am an adventurous soul.  Anyway I have all the tools, respirator, paint gun, compressor, etc.  I am looking for a good resource with information about car painting.  Either someone who has done it themselves that can give me some tips or can direct me to a good web site with some helpful tips for the first-timer.  Wish me luck, if all goes well, this time tomorrow I will have a two-tone Mouse Gray\Pearl White decent-looking bus, instead of the flat gray primer color it now is!
&gt;
&gt; Peace, John Baker
