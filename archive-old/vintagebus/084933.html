Subject: Re: [VB] re:overheating

adding a second place for the air to come in from  does change where  the air 
is sucked in from, which means less goes through the vents,
also (my main point) that does not &quot;stop a vacuum''  from happening
 
I did the tests several times with the pressure meter hooked up to the  
laptop, as well as thermometers in several locations and a  thermocoupler.  I could 
only hook up 4 sensors at a time to the system  I was using, and ended up 
dropping the pressure sensor in favor of another  thermometer as the pressure was 
not doing anything  interesting.   Also I used an air flow meter.   It took  
a while to get the set up right.   I wanted to test more things, but  ran out 
of time.  I'll have to dig the report out. to get the exact  numbers. 
 
 I wasn't measuring pressure in mmH2O, like your test, but mmHg...  what's 
the conversion there?

Fraid not. In order to &quot;change where the  air was sucked through&quot;, I would
have to block off the stock louvers in  order to change where air was sucked
through. I added a second place for  air to come into the engine bay, not
changed where it comes  from.
&gt;
&gt; I found very little difference in engine bay pressure  under tests... as in
&gt; not more than 1mmHg between idle and 4K  rpms.

No offense, but all that means is that you did the test wrong. If  you didn't
detect any air pressure changes in your engine bay from idle to  4000rpm,
your testing was skewed and way off base. Do the test again with  proper
equipment and see for yourself.
