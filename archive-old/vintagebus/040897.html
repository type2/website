Greetings list,

The brake light on my '56 was working just fine but the lens appeared to be
cracked and I wanted to polish up the chrome trim so I took it apart.  Sure
enough, the lens was not only cracked; it was actually in several pieces
held together by accumulated dirt and the trim.  I've managed to find
another lens but that's not the end of the story.

The reflective plating that was in the light has totally disintegrated as in
turned to dust.  The bulb holder has a fair accumulation of rust so now I
have the whole thing out in my hand.  The rust I can probably deal with;
wire brush, POR-15 etc. But how do I replace the reflective plating??

Eastman has a paint they advertise for restoring reflective surfaces.  Has
anyone used it?  Would it work over POR-15?  Any other ideas on restoring
lights?

BTW I'm not in a rush.  We had three feet of snow here in coastal NH last
Monday/Tuesday and it just started to snow again.  Forecast is for another
foot by tomorrow morning.  I've got plenty of project time before spring.

Thanks,
