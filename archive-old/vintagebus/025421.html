Subject: Oil - this is no FART though
Message-ID: &lt;3752781C.1B4721E_at_gmx_dot_de&gt;

Hi Volks,

one thing I never saw mentioned in all those oil FARTs.
So forgive me for starting another AT, and let's hope
it won't be FR :-)

Modern engine oil, be it dino or synthetic, contains, 
among other clever stuff, additives, which are there to 
keep the engine clean.  To achieve this, they keep the 
dirt and debris afloat, so as to be able to carry it 
into the filter.

So far so good, if there *is* a filter.

If there isn't, as in a stock Type 1 engine, the better
way would be to let all the dirt sink to the oil pan's
bottom.  As indeed old-style engine oil did.  If you
keep the stuff afloat, you'd be pumping it back into 
the bearings and things you'd generally want to 
protect from exactly this thing, by having a filter.
And then you'd be doing it again.  And again.  :-)

Which leads to the questions: might it not be a good
idea to run the old-style stuff (like SAE 30) and hope
they didn't add the cleaning additives there too?
Would it be a way to judge the &quot;goodness&quot; of the oil
in that respect (letting go of the dirt) by observing
the amount of sludge that collected in the case
bottom between oil changes?

Someone I met and drunkenly discussed this with on a 
Bug meeting even mentioned running SAE 30 compressor
oil in his Bug engine, the thought being that this
product wouldn't try to keep as much contamination 
afloat because in a compressor, less of it would occur.

On second thought, he might have been pulling my leg.
I actually don't even know if there is such a thing
as SAE 30 compressor oil.

The best option of course is add a filter and run modern
oil (though I agree cheap stuff will do, so much for 
FARTing).  But if we don't (or didn't yet, or can't), 
is the above something to consider?

I retreat and let the knowledgeable discuss.  :-)

Airhowlingly yours,
    Erik.
