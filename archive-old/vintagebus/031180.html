&gt;Hi, Does anyone know of a shipping company who would ship a full length
roof rack from L.A. Calif. to Fort Worth, Texas? Or is anybody headed this
way from L.A. without a &quot;hat&quot; on their bus? Thanks
&gt;
1/2 rack is the largest Greyhound will take.

Maybe http://www.forwardair_dot_com ?  They shipped me a middle seat, they just
strapped it to a pallet and sent it on.  Greyhound can do the 2-piece front
and rear seats.
