&gt; though i think most of the acvws' OE shoes and pads are organic, not
metallic.
&gt; brake drums are not &quot;forever parts&quot;... they are going to eventually wear
past
&gt; specified limits, whether or not you have them turned.

Correct, but I prefer to let them wear, rather than pay someone to
accelerate the process for me.

&gt;     IIRC the last set of bus shoes i ordered was organic... if I had the
option
&gt; of semi-metallics, I would give them a try... as I try to be easy on the
brakes.
&gt; brakes will last a long time, given an attentive driver (as we all
know....)..

Many of the chains, Autozone, Checker, etc. are on the lifetime pad and shoe
kick and offer semi-metallics for just about everything. I don't know about
buses specifically, I buy my VW brake parts at a VWFLAPS but they offered
semi-metallic.

&gt;     making the vehicle stop as fast and as safely as it did when it left
the
&gt; showroom is IMHO logical.
&gt;
Naturally. Turning the drums is just an unnecessarily expensive way of
arriving at the state.

&gt; if you are a good sander-of-drums,

I don't sand the drums, I scratch through the glaze. 40 grit particles are
spaced apart quite a bit, the drum doesn't look like it was turned, it just
looks scratched.

&gt; &gt; Lifetime pads are warrantied, but the drums they are eating up aren't.
&gt;
&gt; shoe-to-pad conversion kits?

As you know, I meant shoes.

&gt; How much money will a better brake system be worth in a panic stop
situation
&gt; when you don't have an out?

A brake system is not automatically better because of having the drums
turned, or simply because a certified mechanic did the work. A laymen is
just as capable of keeping the brakes in spec as anyone, providing they have
the equipment and knowledge to do it. It is more likely that a certified
tech will get it right than the average Joe on the street, but it is not a
given.

&gt; people who do their own brakes do so mostly i think because they are
trying to
&gt; save money... and us vw people are *especially* famous for cheaping-out on
parts
&gt; and so on...

I for one do not do my own brakes out of cheapness. I do it out of fear. The
same kid we have all heard of that didn't tighten the drain plug when
changing oil at Jiffy Lube may have moved on to a new job at the brake shop,
and I don't wish to eat the car in front of me because the shop is having a
hard time finding good help. Most shops hire one or two certified mechanics
and then fill the bays with pointy-headed parts changers. The odds of the
certified mechanic doing your brakes is small. I know a kid who worked at
several dealers in town doing this stuff. The mechanic would look the car
over and tell junior what to change. Kid can't even give his own car a
tuneup, but he can change parts. I bought a new Ch*vy a few years back. It
was a van so it was a pain to work on. Had the dealer service thing all the
way along. After its fifth tuneup it was running poorly so I took the
doghouse off to check it out. The carpet installed by the van conversion
place was glued up onto the doghouse about 6 inches. It had NEVER been
removed. The original air filter was still in there in all of its filthy
glory, the plugs had never been changed, etc. All of the work they had
charged me for their ASE certified mechanics to do had never been done.
Which led me to check the wheel bearings they had repacked, must have filled
them with dirty motor oil if they did it. The 15 shiny bays in the service
department and crisp uniforms did not help with reality. Sure, the
perception that the work was being done right was there, but that's all it
was. The mechanic does what the service manager wants them to do. A good
mechanic can do consistently high quality work in a shop and the customer
can still be getting ripped off. If the mechanic does an oil change, he
doesn't know that the customer brought the car in complaining that the
brakes were pulling every since the last brake job the shop did, and while
it's in go ahead and do a tuneup, radiator flush, and tranny service too. He
only knows that he is supposed to change the oil.

Brakes are far too important to leave to chance. Either learn to do the work
yourself, or find a specific mechanic that you trust and can speak directly
with to have it done. Telling a guy with a tie at the counter isn't
sufficient in my book. Leaving it in the parking lot of a big name shop and
trusting them to get it right is absolutely reckless.
