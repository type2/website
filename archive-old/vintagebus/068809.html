&gt; i just wanted to say how cool it was of the veewees and clara to give that

&gt; a leg-pull (notice he vanished when the jig was up).

Hi Craig,
We were suspicious from the start with that &quot;Martin&quot; sounding lingo to begin 
with, but figured what the heck if it was for real there was someone who 
needed some info and directions to it.  If not, there are many lurkers, some 
of which are beginners now or in the future who might need now or later hit 
the archives for this info or other info if they know of the archives.  The 
main thing is to support fellow bus owners, even if we can not agree an 
everything or perhaps anything!
Thanks,
Eric&amp;Barb
