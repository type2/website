OK...its free, but its a bay window.  Here's the story.

On my way back form Idaho on the ill-fated Westy rescue, I was stopped
by a guy driving down the I-5.  We're just south of Redding CA, when a
Buick with two old men start honking and waving at me.  Since I'm
pulling my newly acquired 67 Westy behind me I immediately think
something is wrong.  I roll down the window and the passenger shouts
&quot;hey....want another one like that?&quot;  Well I don't have to tell you what
any self respecting bus nut would say do I.  &quot;Yeah!&quot; I shouted back.  My
wife in the back seat scowling at the very thought of not one but two
junkers clogging the already clogged driveway.  Visions of an original
owner barn door deluxe tucked away in a barn some where dancing through
my head as we both pulled off at the rest stop near Red Bluff.

As I got out of the truck and introduced my self to the two men my hopes
were dashed as he explained that the bus was just like the one on the
trailer...&quot;sept' its a '71 with one big windshield and is a camper.&quot;
Crap! I thought. &quot;ain't got no tranny or motor either...I just don't
want to crush her&quot; he said.  &quot;I need the room to fix up my 74 super
beetle...its a sun roof ya know&quot;.  Super cool a super beetle with a
sunroof!

Well, there it is.  A free bus sans drive train, and its a '71.  The
gentleman's name is Ray Brown, and his phone # is (530) 529-4359.  Ray
lives in Red Bluff (Central) CA.

I'm sorry I've taken a few weeks to post this...I forgot all about the
thing till I found the # in my wallet tonight.  Post back to the vintage
list if anyone goes and gets it.  I'd be curious to find out what it
looked like.
