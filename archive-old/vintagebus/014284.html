this sucks but I have taken on too many projects and I'm going to 
have to let this one go...

  I've recentlly purchased this bus from a friend so I do know a lot of 
its history.it is a walk-thru
it does run and drive and has new brakes 
it has been stripped and primered with dp40 all the windows and 
sunroof mech. have been removed
this is a complete bus with all the trinkets it is only missing the 
middle seat. it does need some rust repair to the cargo floor 
,rockers and front floors but I have all new panels for it!
this bus has been lowered the correct way with wolfgang spindles 
and straight axle kit by the PO I do have some stock spindles and 
a big nut tranny that go with it or I can trade it out (I will deduct 
from the price of the bus if you don't want the lowered stuff)
I already purchased alot of new parts:
-cloth headliner
-rust repair panels
-sunroof top
-complete seal kit
all from wolfsburg west

I am asking $4200/offer

thanks
