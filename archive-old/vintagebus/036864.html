Subject: Harbor Freight warranty experience? (was torquemesiter on big nut tranny)
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I'm guessing from the responses that no one has ever gone the torquemeister 
route on the big nut.

Britt concurred.

Normally I am extremely wary of the Harbor Freight IMHO crap.  No need to go 
into disparaging remarks about countries of origin. Twenty years ago, the 
quality was probably a lot better than it is today.  I usually only buy 
something from HF when it is designed to be disposable or when I only need to 
use it once or twice.  But at $45 for a 3/4 inch metric socket set compared 
to $600 list for the Snap-On set, one has to reconsider tool standards.  Like 
most of you, I like to use hand tools that have a lifetime warranty like 
Blackhawk, Mac, Snap-on, SK, and even Craftsman**.  Dealers for these tools 
can usually be found in most cities when you are out on the road.  But even 
more, these tools are probably better quality to start with and are less 
likely to break in the first place.

I see, however, that Harbor Freight also has a lifetime warranty on hand 
tools and a phone number to call for replacement (1-800-444-3353).  Anyone 
like to convey his or her experience with this warranty?  HF has a lot of 
retail stores out West (USA).  Anyone ever tried to take a broken hand tool 
back to a retail store for warranty exchange?  Lots of HF in the archive, but 
nothing on using the warranty.

**RANT ON&gt;&gt; I've heard that even the big-box, sprawl-mall, 
suck-your-downtowns-dry, retailers that are eating our scenic rural areas for 
breakfast and crapping out depressing generic same-as-anywhere automobile 
dependent shopping hell such as Home Creepo, Blowes, and Wal Fart are selling 
lifetime warranted hand tools. I guess they cover the cost of the few 
returned units through mass volume sales of cheap plastic crap. &lt;&lt;RANT OFF -- 
PLEASE FLAME OFF-LIST
