Hello list!

Mark your calendars for Sept. 15-17! 2nd annual Josh Rodgers Memorial Beer
Bash will be taking place just outside of  Davis, Oklahoma at Turner Falls
state park located about 80 mi. south of Oklahoma City on I-35 exit 51. This
is a family camp-out, so don't let the name fool you. If you knew Josh, you
know how Art Long came up with the name. It is a beautiful camp-ground with
full facilities, swimming, hiking,  waterfalls over 100' tall, and even an
old castle to explore! This event is aimed at TypeII's, but all makes of
VW's are welcome.
  Fri. evening will be for setting up camp, socializing, part swapping or
whatever. Sat morning Art has put together a scenic cruise to a couple
nearby towns, and will also include a poker run featuring some unusual, and
fun door prizes! We will then take a caravan (for those interested) through
Arbuckle Wilderness. This park features wild animals, some of which you can
feed through the window of your bus! Isn't that what safari windows were
made for?! Sat. evening will be more socializing, good times, and even an
engine case burn in memory of Josh. Sun. we will cool off at the swimming
hole (with diving boards and slides) before everyone heads out.
  Last year we were delighted to host several listees, and we hope to see
even more this year. We already have more reservations than attended last
year. This is a very fun camp-out in memory of a guy who did a lot for the
Type II community!
If you are interested in coming, or seek further info feel free to E-mail
me. We are trying to get an idea on the number of people attending as we are
going to have a private area of the park and make t-shirts. Hope to see you
there!
