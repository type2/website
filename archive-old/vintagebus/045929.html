I want to clarify what I had said earlier.  It seems several of you think

I'm driving around in a bus with a burnt up clutch.  I'm not because here's

why.


When I'm stopped on a hill and getting ready to take off, I do all the steps

so fast and fluid that one can't even tell I'm actually going through

Hi NQ,   I am wondering  what kind of hills you have around there.    I 
started using the ebrake system on hills when I was spending a lot of time in 
SF.   WHen I am stopped on a hill  of serious incline with a car a foot from 
the back of the bus  I dont want to roll backwards into it, which would be 
really easy.  The other reason for the ebrake is that wih some of these 
slopes, it gets tiring waiting a long light with your foot on the brake.  
Cause you have to really press down.  At a flat stop, or on a lesser incline  
you dont, but on the hills stop, yup, so I pulled the hand brake, just 
easier.   WFM, DWWFY.   I do use this system in oly but only once in a while, 
hilly here in places, but not  usually that steep.
