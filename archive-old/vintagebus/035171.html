Subject: Re:  [VB] Oil cooler
To: hryn_at_earthlink_dot_net, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

My question is this: were there &quot;heavy duty&quot; oil coolers available? I just

got an oil cooler that I bought on eBarf and it fits perfect on the mount

and the holes line up perfect but two of the bolts are simply too short!!!

Original cooler as I remember was a bit thinner. This baby is like 3.25&quot;

thick, 3.25&quot; wide and about 10&quot; long. Does that sound right?


Help me here solve this puzzle.

perhaps you have a typeIV cooler?   Does it fit nice in the doghouse fan 
shroud or is the cooler too fat?   Perhaps you should do the IV cooler  
withadapting the tin (cut and weld) and using longer studs to attach cooler.
