Back when I had a '80 Vanagon (aircooled) I
rigged up a water misting system using a new
1 1/2 gallon garden sprayer a length of drip
tubing and a mist head.  I had the sprayer
between the front seats, and with a fully pumped
tank it would spray for just over an hour, the
length of my commute. I hung the mist head just
inside the left air intake vent louvers. 

I bought a Radio Shack
inside/outside battery thermometer with a 10'
lead for the outside temp sensor.  I kept a log
of the temperature in the cab, windows open to
record the ambient temperature, and the remote
temp lead hanging in the engine bay to record
the 'lowered' air temperature due to to the
cooling effect of the water mist.  I ran the 
drip tubing along the gutter and held it in 
place with clothespins.  I had an oil sump plate
temperature guage in place.  I did this for 
about 5 weeks, driving the same route, taking
temperature readings at places I thought the
temperatures would be stable.

And I suppose you want some results!
No discernable drop in oil temperature.
Air temp drop of about 5 degrees.

Bottom line, not enough temperature drop to
be worth the effort.  I now, however, use the
sprayer with mister under the canopy during the
summer when working outside.  Total cost of 
the misting rig, about $10 or less.

I didn't use a mister on the right side for fear
of messing up the electronic Vanagon computer 
stuff.

For a split, it might would be worth trying
using two misters, one for each side.  Maybe
some would get into the intake and through the
oil bath filter.  Figure about 1 gallon per
hour per mister, size the tank based on that.

Jeff, busless still, 
but I make up for it with words!
