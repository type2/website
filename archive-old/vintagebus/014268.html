Message-ID: &lt;19991212042704.5539.qmail_at_awcst094_dot_netaddress_dot_usa_dot_net&gt;

going back to boston for about two weeks before I go to switzerland for a
semester(I'll probab;y be off list for about 5 months Jan-May.

but before then I need to drive back to boston for the holidays(you know home
for the holidays, gets my mom all excited...)

anyway I am in houston and will eb driving back to boston I am not sure when I
am leaving(probably sometime between teh 15 and 17) The only stops I know I am
going to make are in WAshington DC and New Jersey, maybe New York. 

Anyone else along the way, if I remember correctly John shjoudl have a home
brew for me, or at least I hope he does.  This time I don't plan on rushing
the trip as much as I have the past couple of times...so let me know if you
want to see a '65 kombi in pretty decent shape, and a happy driver in not such
great shape..

-Kevin 
in houston for a few more days....
