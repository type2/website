&lt;&lt; Hey all you Southern CA junk yard scavengers.  Ever ponder the question
why so few busses left in your favorite you pull it yard???   Well,
today I might have found an answer.

While cruising the DC home from work, I spied a orange over white logo'd
panel van parked in front of a upholstery shop on Lankershiem blvd.  I
hung a right at the corner the shop was at and stopped to briefly check
it out.  At first I thought what an ugly color combo (Ford engine orange
over white) and then I saw the logo on the front door &quot;Pick-a-Part&quot; was
the name.  Its the name of one of the biggest you pull it car yards in
the South West, and it seems someone there has a hankering for the
vintage bus.   Could be that all the busses get set aside and picked
over before they ever go into the yards...just a guess though.  That, or
some enterprising folk have a standing order for any and all pre-68
busses.

This particular bus was a post '61 panel (not sure if W/T or bench) with
two stationary windows put in the drivers side.  It was painted the
previously mentioned orange over white paint with logos on the front
doors.  No over riders on the bumpers.  Looked like a fresh resto.

Anyone else seen it.
