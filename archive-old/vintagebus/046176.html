 again is it so bad to improve a bus by repainting it?? Any thoughts out
 there-- &gt;&gt;

You see, that all depends. When it has some vintage logos like that single 
cab Thom is dreaming of, then you can't repaint over stuff like that. It's 
all about the logos, logos look cool, but real ones are the best. You can 
repaint them, but never get that same effect like the old faded logo over the 
old paint.
