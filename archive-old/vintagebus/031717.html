I have been useing this sump set-up for over 3 years on various vehicals,
the most with 34,000 miles on it. These have a saftey valve in them to
prevent air suction and I have yet to see a problem with them, except the
people who don't clean them and let them clog. I am amazzed at how much
stuff they catch and I can really tell what's going through the engine when
I do clean it.  There was a problem whan they first came out, but that was
due to a paper throw away element instead of the metal one they now use.

A filter sump is a special plate that replaces the sump plate and contains
a filter.  this is not a good idea because it puts the filter on the
suction side of the pump which can cause big problems if you get an air
leak in the pickup system.

&gt; What is a &quot;filter sump&quot;?
&gt; 
&gt; Do you have any literature you could scan?  I'm curious if this is a
better 
&gt; way to go to get filtration than using special oil pump covers, drilling 
&gt; and/or plugging holes in the block, etc.
