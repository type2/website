Hi all,

Some may remember my plight to find original carriage bolts that hold the
rear seat pedestal to the cab in a 59 double cab... Well, I finally did find
one original bolt (Thanks John Yust!!! :-) ) but in the process I found some
bolts from McMasterCarr that are close (but not perfect).  The bolts cost me
about a dollar apiece after shipping and everything... I had to buy a bag of
50!  I do not have the washers or wing nuts.

If anyone wants some, send me $2.00 for two bolts and a self addressed
stamped envelope with postage for 3 ozs (77 cents).
