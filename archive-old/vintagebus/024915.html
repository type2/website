I have seen a comfortor off a bed stuck in as a headliner (&amp; insulation?)
Seem to remember they held it in place with the headliner bows.  Looked okay,
easy to do.   You could even put some fabric under the comfortor for
decorative purposes, though the one I saw was just a plain white comfortor.
