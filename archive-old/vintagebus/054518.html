Subject: Dating a tranny

	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

So I'm taking a mystery transaxle apart and I intend on installing it in =
my bus.  I wish I knew what year bus it can from.  Do all pre-63 =
transaxles have 36 mm nuts at the hubs? When I look in the Bentley the =
picture of the brakes looks like the 230 mm drum and not like the 250 mm =
drum - does this help with year identification?  The number on the =
transaxle in my bus B with 7 digits, while the one I plan on installing =
is H with 7 digits - does this mean the mystery tranny is made after =
mine?

This does seem a bit stupid - going through all this with on a mystery =
transaxle.  But this way I can get my original rebuilt and still drive =
my bus while it's being done.=20

TIA
