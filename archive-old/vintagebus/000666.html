&lt;&lt; I guess it can only be the switch or the motor. Which is the most

Hi Mike,
Switch!  Try bypassing the switch by wiring around it, and see what happens.  
We had the same happen to us.  Took the switch apart.  Cleaned, and tightened 
the points inside up.  Has worked fine for 4-5 years since then!   Eric&amp;Barb
