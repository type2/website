Valley Chapter of Strictly Vintage 2s' first big event!  Held in 
conjunction with the Red Barn Swap Meet at (duh) the Red Barn just north of 
Salinas, CA (about 40mi south of San Jose) along Hwy 101.  Bus show and 
raffle where every bus entered is eligible for every show category!  Raffle 
with donations from all the local shops and some of the larger
