Some tips on your painting set-up.

I've got a 5hp 20 gallona sears crafsman compressor and it works fine. Make
sure you've to an air regulator at the gun in addition to the one on the
compressor. You can get one at Wal-mart or anyplace better.

Also, the big problem with painting is water in your lines. I made a cool
little water trap using PVC and have been REALLY happy with it. It cost
about $15 in parts.

I run about a 1 or 1 1/2 feet PVC from compressor. Then about 1 to 1 1/2
feet up. Then about 1/2 over. Then 1 to 1 1/2 feet back down. Then about
1/2 over to a water filter (can buy at Wal-Mart/sears, ect.) then hook the
hose to that. Both of the sections that have PVC going up and down have a
valve at the bottom to let H2O out of. I can't stress enough how much this
has helped in sandblasting, painting, ect. When I paint, I go ahead and buy
one of the big orange round water filters that you put on your gun. They
cost about $7 and definatly are nice as an extra precaution. I tried to
make a diagram to show my set-up, hope it comes out right.
