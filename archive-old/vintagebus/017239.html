debby,the girls and i went with strictly vintage 2s. i
was kinda wondering what happened to you. the last
thing i had seen, you were gonna make it. a decent
size gathering. i think maybe a hundred buses, about
half were swapping. some people and stuff i hadn't
seen before. the raffle was good. by noon a portion of
the attendees had packed up and gone, so most ticket
holders won something. the big winner was john
winkley, president of sv2s. he won a '59 walk-thru
panel bus! there were also two sets of tires, 14s &amp;
15s, a bentley bus manual etc. the weather was great
for us, a bit warm for the so cal folks, near 80* and
sunny. lots of pet food was collected. all and all, a
fine way to spend a sunday.
