&gt;Where would the 9-prong box be mounted?

Near the fuse box, on that rail just below the front edge of the parcel
shelf.  You might have to take down the front trim panels to find it,
or the place where it used to be.

&gt;On the main dash I have (from right to left) I have a little metal toggle
&gt;switch, the wiper knob, speedometer housing, the headlight knob, then
&gt;the flasher knob.

Actually that sounds like left to right, unless it's a right-hand drive
Bus.  The metal toggle switch doesn't sound original.

&gt;Also there is another little toggle under the dash that is not attached
&gt;to the dash board and doesn't seem to control anything either.

Probably not original.

&gt;Do you or anyone else have a picture of the original dash and turn
&gt;signal switch that I could see online.

Here's a shot of a bare dash from the left:

The above, modified for later models and annotated with switch positions:

Here's the dash in my '64, from the right.  The thing between the
fuel gauge and the speedo pod is the hazard warning light.  On your
Bus, the hazard knob should light up instead.
