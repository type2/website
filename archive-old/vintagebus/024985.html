Dear Lists,

I have been corresponding with a Japanese man who owns a 66 Riviera
camper in excellent condition.  The previous owners were Orin and
Loraine Tilley, of Winslow, Washington. He emails me through an
interpreter, so joining the list for him is definitely out.

He has tried to contact the Tilleys, but has so far failed.  He is
looking for information on the history of his bus. He has sent me many
pics, and it is a beaute! One clue is the sticker in the rear hatch
window for what I presume is a bus club: North Shore Bulli Boys. Is this
a hawaiian club?

The bus also has a type 181 large style air cleaner and not the correct
style for that year, if this jogs anyones memory of the bus.

Please p-mail me if you want pics, or have info on this bus. He doesn't
want to get a bunch of english email, so I am trying to funnel any
replies to him through the interpreter.....

Also, is there still an address for sending a vin# to the german VWAG
headquarters? My links to Pim Van Loon's page seem to be broken... :(

Thanks list!
