Subject: '67 Westy finds new home
References: &lt;199811142014.NAA29311_at_yiff.azaccess_dot_com&gt;

Can't tell y'all how excited I am to have found a '67 Westy. Came up with
an all original rust-free sea blue-cumulus white European delivery model
with most all the goodies having been factory installed (the plate is
loaded with M-codes). Can't wait to start having fun with it. Gotta find a
tent, though. I'm unsure about which kind to be looking for - my bus has
back-up lights making it a later production '67. I've gotten some advice
about early and late tents but all opinions (and sources of a good,
complete tent) are welcome.

I'm psyched!
