Subject: Re: [VB] WTB Steering Box

I hate their safaris, and I think the cost of their rebuilds is high,
but they do good work.  They rebuilt the locking column for my '60 DD.
I had 2 extra steering boxes done, one for the '55, and an extra, for which
I have no idea now why I had it done.

&gt; I just went through a whole drama about my steering box. Wolfgang gave me
&gt; alot of advice and help on stuff to do before I bought theirs. I ended up
&gt; opening and finding that it wasn't my problem, but through extensive whining
&gt; and phone calling of everyone who would listen, I was assured that Wolfgang
&gt; may be the ONLY place to get them rebuilt. All of my sources for old ones
&gt; all felt that I was just going to get a 40 year old thing that may not be
&gt; better than the one I had.
&gt; 
&gt; And if I had to get a new one I could trust that I was getting a good box
&gt; from Wolfgang. You might have to bight the bullet.
