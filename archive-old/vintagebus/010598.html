Subject: My poor fence (was Whew, that was close)
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Here's a picture of the damage to my fence.  You can see how close to the bus 
the woman came.  She was originally aiming right for my doublecab (just to 
the left of the camper), but when she hit the stop sign, she veered into the 
fence.
