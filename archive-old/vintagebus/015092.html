I agree with ya.  Even with NOS parts, there are sometimes fit
issues; why?  Because the dies to make the stampings wore over time,
so a piece made at one point in time would be slightly different than a
piece made two years later.  Look at some of the stampings that are
identical for a large range of buses, and if you have the luck of
ever having used such a piece, you might see a fitment issue.  I installed
an NOS 1/4 panel on my '54, and definitely saw spots where it wasn't
*perfect*, but I had a Schofield panel to compare it against, and it
was defintiely better.

OTOH, the repro pieces are usually patterned after a very good
used or NOS piece, *but* a) the means of fabricating them are totally
different; b) there's errors introduced by the &quot;human factor&quot; in
reproducing them.  

The more complex the part (ie doglegs) the harder it is to repop.

The pressed used to make the original parts were *HUGE* - check out the
History Channel segment on VW's some time, where they show body sections 
being stamped.  The guy puts a big sheet of metal on the press, and *wham* -
a second later it's a bug 1/4 panel.  The repro guys don't have the same
machinery available to them.
