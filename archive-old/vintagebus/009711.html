Hi All,
For some reason when you push the
horn button on my 62 westy, a loud whirring sound 
comes out of the steering box. At least it *seems* to
be coming from the steering box. Don't know where else
it could be from. Why is there a wire to the steering box anyway?
The PO removed the original horn and 
installed an Alstate twin horn on the other side of the bus.
The iriginal horn wires were still hanging, so I hooked up a bug horn.
Still No horn. I haven't chased down the wire going to 
the aftermarket horn yet.  
Any ideas on that noise?? Very strange.
Thanks,
Larry
