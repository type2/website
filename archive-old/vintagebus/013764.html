Hi Paul,
   Interestingly my father taught me to do speaker repairs the same way using

It goes to show you that there is nothing new under the sun!  In fact, there
are really no absolutely unique inventions, just minute improvements on things
of the past.  (Why did it take so long to use the wheel as well as we use it
today?  Could it be because of very small improvements and no real &quot;leaps and
bounds?&quot;  That is a whole 'nuther non-bus topic!
