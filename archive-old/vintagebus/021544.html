Subject: Re:  [VB] Deluxe trim screws = interior screws?
To: jelm2_at_yahoo_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com


I bought a set of Deluxe beltline screws at a recent
show. The guys selling them said the deluxe interior
panel screws were the exact same screws, except that
the panel screws used the aluminum washers.

nope, the trim screws are shorter, and I think slightly fatter.  Also, the 
trim screws are phillps, and the interior screw are slotted (except 67 I 
think)
