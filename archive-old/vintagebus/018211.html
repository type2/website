Subject: headliner installation
To: cousinit_at_usa_dot_net
Cc: buslist &lt;vintagebus_at_lenti.type2_dot_com&gt;

Cousin it asked about installation of headliner
cardboard (or wood).
Ellis suggests,
Installation of the front headliner pieces has been
most successful for moi (me) with the headliner pieces
covering the maindeck *uninstalled*.
In otherwords install the front first, far rear second
and then pop the central, main deck piece in lastly.

Other suggestion is to make sure that the
track/grooves into which the front headliner pieces
are to be installed are free from debris of any kind.
I have cheated and used a minor amount of silicone
spray, liquid soap and on one occassion a minute
amount of white lith grease when installing wood.
Common sense is not to use anything other than elbow
grease and patience when installing the re-pop/OG
cardboard pieces.
Good Luck!
