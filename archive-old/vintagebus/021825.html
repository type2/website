&lt;&lt; I have no idea what Carb jets are..... :)
  &gt;&gt;
Hi Jason,
Carberator jets are replaceable brass openings that allow fuel or air in the
proper amount to be delievered to the engine.  Check you Bentley manual for
your year VW and engine also for both jet sizes and what they look like and
where they are in your carb.  There are three jets you have to have of the
correct size to get both the MPG and HP that the engine was designed for.
Pilot jet (Only one VW carb we know of had two of these all others have only
one.) controls the idle with the air fuel mixture screw that gives this fine
tuning.  Main jet controls fuel in the lower and meduim acceleration of the
VW.  While the Air Correction jet adjusts the mixture at high RPMs of the
engine.  This is the one jet that adds more air (instead of more fuel.) the
bigger the hole through it's top.   Eric &amp; Barb
