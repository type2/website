&gt; I've been talking with Hole family in an attempt to clear up this ugly
mess
&gt; with acusations, insults, cross-acusations, and whatnot.   I really don't
&gt; want there to be any bad blood between us, and this was turning into a
&gt; Hatfield's vs McCoy's.
&gt;
&gt; I *did* make a statement that was factually incorrect, and that was with
&gt; regards to Bob Hole cutting up early American cars into street rods, and
&gt; for that I apologize.  I don't actually know Bob Hole, and I should not
&gt; have gone after him on the *personal* level.
