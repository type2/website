Hey Charlie

Count on my support for the BPRS list. 
I have had to call on a listee for help recently in my
travels from Reno to Phoenix while in the middle of
NOWHERE (cell phone to the rescue) my generator went
south. Thanks a million to Ronnie of The Old Volks
Home in Lake Havasu AZ for helping me when I was in
need.
On the other hand, on my return trip I was asked by
another Bus owner for help when his Bus(loaf) stopped
running about three hours out of Phoenix. I got his
bus up and running and asked him for nothing but his
help someday to another VW owner in need.
I'm in!
Big garage (6 car size) on five acres with every tool
you would ever need.

Chuck Notmeyer
