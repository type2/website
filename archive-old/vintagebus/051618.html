Subject: RE: [VB] resistance question

the coil to cap wire should have 0 (zero) ohms (horseshoes) resistance.
i've had bad coil wires, and replacing them made the world of difference.
the cap to plug wires themselves rarely go bad in terms of resistance, it's
almost always the end connectors that screw on to the wires. connector
resistance, according to the vw service manual for bug 70-79 states 5000 to
10,000 ohms (horseshoes)
rotor resistance should be no more than 10,000 ohms (horseshoes)

&gt; [Original Message]
&gt; Hey all,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm finally getting into the '65 Kombi that I just bought, doing the
tune-up, valves, all that good stuff. I found that the coil was just
putting out a wimpy orange spark at the dizzy wire, so I figured I'd get a
new one since it looks like the original coil. While I was in there,
though, I checked the resistance of the coil-to-dizzy wire and found it to
be 5K ohms. This seems awfully high for a 6&quot; wire with no resistor cap. Is
it time for a new wire? I then checked resistance in the #2 spark plug wire
and found it to be 2K ohms (all the way to the cap), which doesn't surprise
me for a sparkplug wire. My BMW motorcycle (also aircooled) specifies 5K
Ohm resistance in the sparkplug wires (actually, the resistor is in the
cap), and I was wondering if there is also a standard for VWs. Anyone,
anyone.....
