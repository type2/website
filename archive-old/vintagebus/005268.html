Subject: Rear safari?

I checked out that CE safari page and am wondering about the large and small
rear safaris. This means that I also do not know, are the rear windows on
singlecabs and buses? It seems they would, but I hadnt gotten around to
asking you all.  Also, are there any pics of how far the rear safaris
actuate? Or if you can describe how far they open out.

Thanks again folks,
