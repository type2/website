Subject: Re: [VB] Tacoma powder coating and seat reassembly

----- Original Message ----- &gt; I agree. I9ve got both brands &amp; I think they
are different.  I believe the
&gt; WW instructions tell you to install the rods/wire which I should have done
&gt; w/ the TMI seats in my DC.

I haven't done the WW seat covers, but I did some TMI &quot;vintage series&quot; for
my old 64 Deluxe last year (very nice!). The driver seat fit excellent, but
the passenger side (bench seat) seemed a bit 'loose' and I ended up pulling
a bit extra around the back to fit good. Used up all the wifes good metal
coat hangers to us as rods in the edges which worked out quite well.
