&gt; my family and friends were all incredulous at the story of the help I
&gt; received from the list. I on the other hand was quite proud to be a member
&gt; of such a great community. I only hope that I may one day return the favor
&gt; to another member.

This is the reaction that I got from my friends where I was broken down in
Utah.  An email to the list produced in short order the information I
needed and a nearby source for the part (on a sunday in utah) as well as
offers of direct assistance.

My friends, who assumed that the lists and AIRS was someting like AAA,
asked &quot;How much do you have to pay for that service?&quot; :)

Remember folks, the thing that makes the list so valuable is the listees.
We all get an opportunity to lend a hand now and then, even if it is just
a ride to the parts store, so when that opportunity comes to you jump to
it!
