Hey Colleagues:

Got a question for all of you with the early style front sliding glass windows, the ones without holes for the latch.  Pre '60?  Anyway, as you know the felt track is different from the later style with the latch thru the glass.  As far as I know noone repops the earlier style felt.

The easy solution is to replace my sliding windows with the holes in the glass.  But, like so many of you, I don't want to take the easy route and would rather drive myself crazy trying to stay &quot;stock&quot;.

I've heard that one way is to buy two felt kits and cut them up and somehow *splice* halves togehter to make one good set out of two.  Tedious but maybe the only solution.

Any other ideas out there is Type II land?  TIA.

Robert
