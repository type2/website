&gt; Doc:
&gt; Actual 71's had a different bolt arrangement for the engine/trans bolt on the
&gt; top left.

I had this problem with my '69, and solved it by 
using an allen head bolt for the upper driver's
mounting bolt.  It was pretty hard to find the
bolt, but I believe I ended up finding them at 
NAPA.

&gt; just change the bellhousings along with the engine.

&quot;just change the bellhousing?&quot;
You do realize how much grimy, greasy, 
smelly, sweaty, cussing work you're
laying on Doc in a sentence beginning
with &quot;just&quot;, don't you?  You are sadistic
and twisted :-)
