 &gt; I gotta replace the steering box on the '58 Single Cab.  Anyone happen to
 have a good to excellent used one lying around??  Shipping both ways + $200
 for a rebuilt one from Wolfgang isn't really my first choice.
 &gt;
 &gt; TIA.

you might want to say where you are- people sometimes do have good ones 
around, and I see them at swaps sometimes even cheap as they are taking up 
space in someone's garage.   But Ya, Wolfgang $200 is available now.
