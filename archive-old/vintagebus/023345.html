I'm sure that NQ will eventually reply to this, but since he's off to BNNTA 
I'll do my best.

Unfortunately I cant access the archives so I'm stuck.  Anyways, Bob Hoover 
wrote in quite some time ago about how Jeep (CJ 5/CJ 7 I think) wiper arms 
could be retrofitted to work on a split bus.  The Jeep arms are much more 
readily available than bus ones and accept a standard wiper insert.

A search of the archives should turn up bob's post.  I'd guess that is was 
sent back in 97 or 98 some time.  If you cant find that, ask NQ, I'm pretty 
sure he still has it.

Sorry I couldnt be more help
