Hey list,

The tires I was talking about have 2 ply sidewalls, and 1400 pound rating.  
He has 2 sizes, 205 75 14, 225 70 14,  The 205's are $140 for 4, the 225's 
are 160 for 4.  Which should I get?  I have a 4.12 rancho and soon will have 
a new 1600 dual port.( I do not know if that matters or not?)

thanks
domonic
P.S. I am glad we have our own list back because I sure was tired of hearing 
about F.I. ;)
