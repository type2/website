Subject: re: Wolfsburg West panels

I saw the postings about the grey panels that Wolfsburg West offers and
thought I would pass on my experience with them.  First of all, they are
almost as nice as the originals with one complaint.  I have installed a
complete set of panels in a camper bus, double cab, and single cab, and
all three when exposed to any moister warped.  When the days got a
little warmer they would straighten a little.  When first installed,
they all looked great, nice and flat.  My feeling is that the panels are
not as thick as the originals but I have never compared them.  Has
anyone else experienced this?
