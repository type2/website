Per the VW 'Split Screen&quot; Transporter Specifications, Modifications &amp;
Optional Extras booklet printed by NEATO, the Split Screen Van Club, and the
Bulli Kartei :

A42 = Standard SO42 interior, no exterior fitments (hard top bus)
B42 = Standard SO42 interior,  pop-up top, side tent and roof rack
C42 = Standard SO42 interior,  pop-up top
D42 = Standard SO42 interior,  side tent and roof rack (hard top bus)



So, you have a standard pop-top westy (walk through option would be on
m-plate too) that did not come with a rack or a tent from the Westfalia
factory.

SO= special models (Sonderausführungen).  (All late 64-67 Westfalias were
either SO42 or SO44 (although I've heard of some 64's being special ordered
with the earlier camper kits).  Only bench seat models were SO44's though.
The difference has to do with the layout of the cabinets and seating.  Some
like the 44 better.  More storage....less rear view though!  The 44's are
much rarer than the fairly common 42s.  One more thing I've recently come to
learn.  Most if not all Euro 42/44's were two tone, while the US bound
(either direct import or UT tourist delivery) were solid colors.  Just
trivia.
