Subject: Re: [VB] re: Keeps eating wheel bearings?

&gt; Our method tends to result in a more accurate/even bearing adjustment because
&gt; you are using the threads pitch on the spindle for the proper spacing.
&gt; Instead of a feel the washer slide, which can be affected due to unknown
&gt; feel/pressure from someones hands, length of screwdriver and even friction
&gt; between parts.  So far after nearly 250,000 miles of driving and repairing
&gt; our own VWs we have not had a single front wheel bearing go bad.  Only time
&gt; we have had to replace these bearings is when found bad when we first get an
&gt; old VW.

Ive got virtually the same results over 150,000 plus using the washer
method. Never had a bearing fail other than used/unknown.
The reason I cant see your method as being any more accurate is that it
depends on the initial tightening.
The real point of it all is they should never be tight.
