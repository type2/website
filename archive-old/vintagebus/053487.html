Subject: carb confusion

Carb jetting, uh-huh.
I have looked at Bentley, looked at obsolete docs Solex manual, looked
at archives, looked a lot (I'm now dizzy) at the carb and still can't
figure it out. Why do I seem to have two pilot jets and two power fuel
systems on my Brosol H30/31? Can anyone clue me in as to what is going
on here? The thing I need to know most urgently is which is my pilot
jet and what the is the other one?
VW FLAPS (Bugformance in Sacramento CA, kinda bug-oriented but I like
'em anyway, we are learning together) did indeed have Solex main and
pilot jets, I picked up a good selection, but no air correction /
emulsion tube jets. Can anyone suggest a source? Are these on Japanese
motor cycles?
Thanks everyone, without y'all I would still be driving a Dodge...

question)

welder, Lincoln 110 with gas?)
Ps. Eric and Barb - Thanks as always, I wish I could give something
back. I want the jet size gauge / tool too, but what store do I go to
to find such things? Same as I haven't found the parts yard with the
dead busses I likewise haven't found the store with the specialized
auto tools. For a good laugh you should have heard me on the phone
trying to find a tool to ream the swing-lever bushings. I wasn't a
motor-head until I got sucker-punched by a cute bus and needed to do
what needed to be done. Dumb question as it is to most of ya, where do
I find such specialized auto tools?
