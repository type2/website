Subject: Sleeper Crewcab pictures

 Alot have asked about pictures of my crewcab with the 350 in it. I posted
some pictures on Everretts VW Planet site. Search under &quot; John Howard &quot;. Also
put 2 pictures of my thumb in to remind all to be very careful around belts
and pulleys.
 See ya at BBBVII in Jan. Ronnie has a ton of great VW raffle prizes already,
plus the rebuilt 1600 complete VW motor and 2 rebuilt bus tranys, one complete
drum to drum.
