And the trade took place. As you all know Isaiah was looking to trade his 63
Standard project for a running bus. Well, I did trade my 64 Camper for it.
Now I have the 63 in my garage and I'm anxious to start work on it. In the
meantime I want to work on the engine and trans and have a question here.
What's the best setup on a 1600cc and trans/reduction boxes? I need to know
gears, ratios and all that stuff. The reason is I want it to handle highway
speeds with no problem. Is the freeway flier a solution? How about DP versus
SP?

Help me here,

Later,
Andre Hryn
