I was able to get off early tonight from &quot;the establishment&quot; (AKA work) and
head up to Lincoln to Williamson's VW in anticipation of seeing the cars and
people on the &quot;Return to Fatherland&quot; tour.  Upon arrival, there were scads
of VWs parked around and I thought that the guys with the tour were already
there.  Turns out they weren't yet - that was good.

I drove by and all kinds of people were looking at us - probably about ready
to puke looking at my primer grey/rust hood - I gotta get to that sometime.
I think I was one of about 3 really rotten looking bugs there - thank god I
parked over out of the way - I almost had to bow my head in shame.

Anyhow, I was standing close to the entrance when they started rolling in.
Bill Collins and Don Buletta (sp?) in their Hebs (although I didn't get to
meet Don personally), a 1943 bug imported from Berlin in 1990, and a few
other splits.  They were all 25hp engines execept for 2 36ers.  I was able
to speak with Bill Bowman and Bill Collins personally and my impression of
them is that they are really down to earth VW lovers who happen to be able
to afford to own some of the most outstanding examples of Vintage VWs.  I
was afraid of meeting Bill, fearing that maybe he would have succumbed to
the glitz and glamour that goes with driving your Heb all over but nothing
was farther from the truth.  He told stories of how their first day or 2
out, the 1953 roached an engine, so 8 guys picked up the bug at a rest stop
so they could do an engine swap.  Another guy that is with them wasn't going
to be able to go but he's such a good mechanic, they paid his way. He's
already paid for himself by turning a 36hp glandnut down to a 25hp one. :-)

I also saw myself on the news tonight.  Once I was in the reflection of a
fender, scratching my head, and the other time I was squatted at the rear of
the 1943 while a nice old white-haired-and-balding VW mechanic told me
stories of days gone by of how he would get old 36 horse engines with bad #3
P/C's.  He'd replace that piston and cylinder and off the engines would run
again.  All this at the back end of an old crank start 1943.  The smell of
that engine, the old cloth wiring, the old crank start apron, and the old
mechanic telling me his stories was almost too overwhelming - it was damn
near VW nirvana.  The best part was that the news crew was filiming &amp; showed
him talking to me fervently (although it was the newslady's voice over that
you heard).  I knew someone was behind us while we talked but I didn't know
it the news crew!

I had the very nice privilege of meeting more listees and some familiar
faces!  I met Rob Laffoon - he's always a hoot - great guy.  Terry Wolfe
with the infamous rusty, trusty, Westy - still runs and still needs work but
that's how we like them around here!  There was also Jeff, a young Sun Bug
enthusiast who always comes up to me when he sees me - I see him at every
show I go to.  Then I met Becky Houck, her husband Rick, and daughter
Amanda - a great family and they all like VWs!  While I was talking with
Bill Collins, some guy comes up and asks me if I was Erin Lassley/No Quarter
(I'm hard to miss with my bowling ball pin physique and overalls) and lo!
It was Steven Reed.  He moved up to Belleville, KS from Topeka and currently
maintains the 2,500 subscriber list to the vintage vw newsletter.  He only
lives 70 miles from me now!  Now in Belleville, KS for just about a week,
he's managed to stop and see Edith Hill, the PO of my 1966 bus.  It turns
out Steve is going to buy out what is left of her VWs and try to open up a
little repair shop.  Yesirree - even in the stix of the midwest, there is a
demand for VW mechanics!

As for busses, there were 2 real nice single cabs, one of which is of  WCM
fame.  The other one is a local VW owners single cab.  I got to thinking
about just why all these guys would want to stop in little old Lincoln, NE
for their big tour and it seems the newslady wondered that too.  Their
answer?  &quot;Lincoln is a great place to stop with lots of VWs and great
enthusiasm for them.&quot;  Well what can I say?  The proof's in the turnout and
I even heard one of the drviers say, &quot;This is way more than we expected.&quot;
:-)

BTW:  I forgot to tell one story from Bill Collins - he said that they were
in Colorado Springs and the dealership had a big banquet table set out right
down the middle of the main shop area with all kinds of food laid out on it.
They all were directed in to park in the engine bays and park on the lifts
so they could service their rides.  Bill seemed quite impressed with it
all - I would be too!

I had a great evening and I steered clear of some of the familiars who have
turned their noses up at me previously.

I must also give honorable mention to Bob Miller.  He drives a really nice
late 50's silver beetle that he fixed up all himself.  He's got pictures to
prove it.  He's such a nice, regular, humble guy who has a really really
nice beetle.  Sure there is a blemish here and there, but to me, for who he
is and what he's done with this old bug, he ranks up pretty high on my list.
He's always willing to shake a hand, talk VWs, and answer my questions
without being a snob.

I'd recommend that if any of you have 2nd thoughts about seeing this tour -
don't think again, just go.  Meet these guys and ask any question you can
think of and they'll patiently answer!  I enjoyed the story about the
mis-adjusted cable brakes that one fella told.  He finally found a mechanic
who could adjust them because he said he couldn't - takes a bigger guy to
admit it. :-)

If any of you listees read this post that were there at the Fatherland Tour
stop, please add to this thread - I'm sure you all have something to add.

Thanks for reading...
