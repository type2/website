Subject: Restoring Doors

I have a 63 samba that I am getting ready to restore.  Both front doors and the right cargo door have rusted through.    The front doors aren't that bad.  The rust on these doors occur on the lip (curved part) of the inside bottom.  It starts from the front of the door and works its way to the back in several spots.  Some of the spots are several inches long.  The bottom has deep surface rust but no rust through.

The right cargo door is completly rusted through along the inside bottom from front to back.

Any sugestions on how to repair the rust throughs?  Does anyone sell curved repair panels that will replace the inside lip?  I was thinking I could cut the rust out and weld a replacement piece in there.  I've also heard about cutting the bottom of the door off and welding a bottom in from a door that has a good bottom.

Thanks!
