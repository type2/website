Hi Dworkin,
Would have to dissagree with part of that after just changing from all red 
USA KG tail lights to yellow turn signal topped Euro taillights.  Huge 
differance!  A seperate brake light is of course going to be better, but 
having it in yellow and having two including the turn signal in them results 
in a much better braking /turn signaling of fellow drivers from our 
experience.  Yellow is just brighter than red.  Also this is is alot easier 
to wire just to the stock rear taillights and CYA yourself if one stock 
signal tail light bulb burns out you most likely still have a turnsignal.
The added trouble for pre-1962 buses and bugs (Around 1958 Popular Science or 
was it Mechanics had a short article on this fact about the bug tail lights 
and touted it as the worse design of the time!) is they have a reflector 
built into the tailight lenses which with a following automobiles bright 
halogens tends to reflect all too well and camoflage (Not to mention the 
running light filiments doing the same.) the signals to death!  Which is not 
helped by the fact that the stock tailights are positioned perfectly to 
relation to the head lights following.  Auxilary center mounted signals seem 
to get less of this problem the closer the following automobile while the 
stock ones just get worse.
We have friends who have installed 1966-67 type 1 back up lights and either 
they have installed red pre-1958 bus center brake light repro lenses or 
painted the insides of the clear backup lights lenses with yellow translucent 
paint with good results.  We are probably going to do this latter solution to 
our 1963 SC due to the rear gate covers the tail lights when down and would 
do the same with auxilary center lights mounted on the license plate frame.
