Hey gang,

There is a 1957 Kombi around my area that I have had my eye on for quite a
while waiting for the guy to sell.  Well that day is here.  I was driving
by it today and almost broke my neck taking a double-take after I saw the
for sale sign.  It is in extremely good shape!  This is a no rust beauty
with less than 100,000 miles!  It is missing the middle seat, and it has
after market tail lights cut in, but they are really cool looking, but not
original :(.  It also has over-rider bumbers, but it has both of them and
they're in good shape.  The paint is ok, with a little
oxidation.  It runs good, and as far as I know everything is mechanically
sound.  All the interior panels and chrome handles are there, but it's
missing a headliner.  Both the front and rear rubber mats are in good
shape, and the seat covers are in pretty good shape.   Anyway, I want
to know if anyone has any suggestions of what this thing would be worth.
