As far as max width goes, it depends on the rims. Take a look at your stock rims and notice that the distance from the lug nut holes to the OUTSIDE of the rims in much less than the distance to the INSIDE of the rims. This keeps the tire inside (toward the engine) so that the tire doesn't interfere with the wheel well. I made the mistake last year of buying four 15&quot; white five spoke rims (baja style) for my '67 westy. Although the lug nut holes were slightly offset to the outside, the offset was not enough to allow for 205 tires. After trying 185 tires, we still ran into clearance problems with the wheel well. I ended up having to go with 165's. However, when we had the bus up on a lift and fitted with the 205 tires (they fit when the bus was off the ground because of the swing axle angle), it appeared (no guarantees here) that they would have worked had I purchased a new set of stock 15&quot; rims because they would have been offset more to the inside. The new chrome stock wheels look very nice also. Of course the other option would be to cut out your wheel wells..........just kidding!

You might also want to check out some feature busses and pickups in past issues of HotVW's, as they usually list the rim and tire sizes in the articles.

I did gain about 5 mph top speed by going from 14&quot; to 15&quot;, but you're speedometer reading will suffer accordingly.

Hey guys, what size wheels do you guys use on your buses? I'm not talking
about original ones though. I'm thinking, well I've got a set of nice
205X60X15 tires off my Bimmer and was wondering if at any point I can put
these on some nice rims and smack 'em on my bus. Would that look stupid?
What width rims should I use and which ones do you recommend? Should I do
it? I mean, my original tires on the bus are pretty much gone and the rims
need work anyway. What do you think?
