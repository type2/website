&lt;&lt; My point is that I find it hard to believe that Dawn has dissappeared
 and wont be heard from again. Much more likely, she is getting her act
 together after moving, and will shortly be getting rolling again. &gt;&gt;

I too know Dawn and I agree with Jack that she'll be back in touch soon.  I 
stopped and saw her after the last OCTO show to see her new SO-34.  Her 
sewing machine was crammed into the kitchen and all her materials were strewn 
about the house.  I'm sure she's just getting her business together in a new 
location, and we'll be hearing from her shortly.  I certainly am planning to 
get some more things from her!
