Subject: split westy curtain measurements?
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.21.0008240848210.3539-100000_at_zarf_dot_org&gt;

hello all,

I searched the archives to no avail on this one.

My friend gave me a set of split westy curtain rods for my 61, but i have
no idea what size the curtains should be.  I woudl just measure some this
weekend at the arkansas eureka springs show, but my girlfriend wants to
start making some tinight with her grandma, so i need the measurements
today.

What i'm looking for:

- top to bottom measurement
- left to right measurement
- how wide is the fold over for the top curtain rod
- how wide is the fold over for the bottom shock cord

Since they are all the same, that makes life easier anyway.  Since i dont
have an OG westy rear window curtain rod or front spring thingies,  i'll
have to fudge those anyway...

thanks a lot!

Steve
