&lt;&lt; Is there someplace I can find the westy code when almost all traces of the
 westiness are gone? this applies to my 64 as well as 68 both were originally
 non pop westies but alas now just kombis. &gt;&gt;
Hi Andy,
Well in the early 60s the camper # was stamped on the rear chassi plate to the
right of the engine.  The other problem is that not all buses that have been
found with westie interiors were westies.  In other words they did not make
the pilgrimage to the Westphalia factory to be converted.  We found a example
of this in a 1964 kombi that had a westie interior and no hatch.  Along with
the paper work came a two page brochure with it that had line drawnings and
directions about the Mosiac Camper Interior and tents.  Which in a nut shell
could be ordered from your local VW dealer to convert your kombi to a Mosiac
Westie Camping Interior.     Eric &amp; Barb
