I knew I would get the cylinder #'s messed up and I hoped this would not throw anyone off. It
is the 3/4 side that is not firing properly. The compression is even all the way around. The
plug wires are in the right place and the carbs are syncronized all the way around. I am
thinking about draining the tank and replacing the screen. There is a little but not much
stuff in the fuel filter. I would think that both carbs should be hesitating if was there was
not enough fuel coming from the tank. I don't think it is a vacuum leak because it does it
even after idle. That side of the motor is just not firing at all.
thanks for the tips so far and anything else you might add I would be grateful for,
