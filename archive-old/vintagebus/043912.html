Re: the Optima Gel battery, I'd like to say that, although I have never
used one in an auto, I do use them for the Fire control/security alarm
monitoring systems in a public school district.  They perform very well in
this mode and they will ballon up when they start to go bad, almost
looking as if they might burst.  Haven't had one do that tho.
later
