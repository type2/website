My (new) case did not have the stud for the bracket to attach to.

&gt; Are you sure your flap rod was bent right or routed right through the
head?
&gt; You shouldn't have had to move the bracket mounting stud anywhere but the
&gt; factory placement. One bracket fits all.

&gt; Decided to go ahead and put the thermostat in.  Figure it will probably
help
&gt; and can't hurt.  Drilled and tapped the case and got all the parts.
&gt; Installed it all tonight.  Never could get the thermostat to where it
would
&gt; go from flaps completely to completely open.  Adjusted it so the flaps are
&gt; partially open cold to wide open hot.  better that what I had before.  Are
&gt; there different style brackets and rods for different sized engines?

&gt; &gt; I would listen to Eric And Barb on this. Yes, you see a LOT of used
&gt; engines
&gt; &gt; without their factory thermostat and flaps, but how many miles are on
&gt; them?
&gt; &gt; From raw experience in the eighties, I can tell you that a motor with
the
&gt; &gt; thermostat and flaps in good operating order on a good motor will
outlast
&gt; &gt; one without the proper equipment. I have built hundreds of motors and
&gt; dozens
&gt; &gt; for myself, my experience says go with the thermostat and flaps on
street
&gt; &gt; engines. If you are racing or sand bogging, that is a different
situation.

&gt; &gt; &gt; You might have to let her warm up a bit, but one of the selling points
&gt; of
&gt; &gt; an
&gt; &gt; &gt; air cooled engine is how fast it warms up.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Hi Carl,
&gt; &gt; Yes, but then it cools down so much especially when idling and hardly
&gt; &gt; reaches
&gt; &gt; a minimum of 160 oil temp to keep not only the water vapor out of the
oil,
&gt; &gt; but also keep alot of raw fuel out of the oil!  Plus you get better ring
&gt; &gt; longevity and better sealing (= more HP) when up to proper engine temp.
&gt; &gt; Lastly your engine does not tear itself slowly apart due to constantly
&gt; &gt; changing shape and size due to these large fluctuant engine temps.
