The upper one wants to be removed using a clamshell puller attachment and
a standard small puller tool. That is ideally how ot do it, but the way
that worked for me, which you will want to try/use is to screw an
appropriate sized metric bolt into the end of the axle, one which is of
proper length to fit all the way into the axle. Use a washer as well on
it. Then, lift the axle tube assembly with your left hand, and gently pull
it towards you as you hit the bolt's head carefully with a sledgehammer (4
Lbs is fine). This method was taught to me by jwilli (Todd) on the list
here. 


That will get your upper bearing off.  You will need a clamshell
attachment and puller of the correct size to do the lower outer bearing. I
tried two screwdrivers and it didn't work. It may work for you, however. 

Be sure to wear eye protection any time you work with pullers.
