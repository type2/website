&gt; just for clarification....which grit sand paper do you use? are we talking 
&gt; like 300 grit? i imagine if it is loose-that is a bad thing, so i want the 
&gt; pulley center hole enlarged enough so the pulley slides on and off without 
&gt; a puller, yet small enough that it is a very snug fit.

Hi Kevin,
Kind of depends on the initial fit.  We will use 60 grit to get really badly 
tight places out of the way quickly, but work up to 300 grit as we go.  Make 
sure to clean the pulley center well especially the oil return groove on the 
OD before reinstalling.

&gt; if i understand your post-you sand in the direction of pulley travel, then 
&gt; try to put it on, and the marks where it hit will show up as perpendicular 
&gt; to the pulley. Then you sand wherever it hits.

Exactly!  The marks will show up as shiny streaks running 90 degrees from you 
last bit of sanding around in the pulley

&gt; second question-you suggest loosening the case bolts around the oil pump a 
&gt; little bit to ease the removal of the pump. is this always required? i 
&gt; admit i fear screwing around with the case bolts-as everything is working 
&gt; well. if i loosen-how many turns ae you talking about? like one turn, half 
&gt; a turn, until the pump slides out? should the pump basically slide out 
&gt; pretty easily?

Basicly you loosen the bolts just enough to relieve the tension off of them.  
The pump will not get loose as in falling out, but half as tight and less 
chance to gall the sealing surface of the engine case around the oil pump.

&gt; one more question...what do you mean seal around the exhaust shell to the 
&gt; shroud? my fan shroud has a secondary type of black tin that bolts to the 
&gt; back of it-to cover the oil cooler. there is a foam strip between these two 
&gt; pieces of fan tin. is that where you mean?

Yes, that is refered to as an exhaust shell by the late bus &amp; bug parts 
books.
