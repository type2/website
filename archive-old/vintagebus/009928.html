&gt;finish it up  The main problem with this harness was the wires were all
&gt;soldered (that in itself isn't that bad) and then covered with the tape.

As a followup, I know soldering is the best but this stuff had gotten wet
and was pure corrosion city.  I'm buying a bunch of heat shrink tubing at
work today so all crimped connections will be heat shrinked individually and
then the whole bundle will either be heat shrinked (if I can find a piece
that big) OR I'll use a piece of garden hose to protect it (keeping the slit
facing down.)
