For SV2s annual Familienfest show (6th Annual this August!) we debated
whether or not to do &quot;professional judging&quot; and opted not for just that
kind of reason.

It's amazing to us, but people's general lack of knowledge on Buses is
vast. On the other hand, most of us are a bit obsessive, no? I had one bug
guy who was DEEP into his vintage bug tell me &quot;I looked at buses, but I
really wanted a 67, and they have too many windows.&quot; That implies that a)
all 1967 buses are 21 windows and b) that would be a horrible thing. I've
had a non-VW employee ask me &quot;do you drive a bug or a bus?&quot; I asked him,
&quot;do you know what a bug is?&quot; &quot;Yes&quot; &quot;Does my car look anything like that?&quot;
&quot;uuhh...&quot; He really didn't grasp the difference.

Oh well..makes the rest of us that more employeeable...oh wait...that's not
right! :)
