Subject: Re: [VB] Bosch 021 distributers timing question?

I had the same problem with mine. If you compare various vacuum can
distributors,  some are made so that the can sits on one side, and
others let it sit on the other side, so the physical interference
won't let some turn to where they need to be for correct timing.

You can correct this by changing the distributor drive shaft index. If
you change the plug wire positions, you will miss out on the detuning
of # 3, if the 021 provides that feature.

Vacuum dizzies provide advance at low throttle cruise for improved gas
mileage. Others on the list might know of other benefits.

   Well I installed the Bosch 021 distributor yesterday and tried to set
 the timing. It seems that the metal pot pie (vacuum advance) won't allow
 it to turn around so the notch on the rim is at the 1 cylinder firing
 position, so I need to either re-arange the wires (1&amp;3, 2&amp;4) or change the
 valve setting 180 degrees apart (probably the wires!) This distributer
 seems to be the one for 71 engines and I've heard that the Mexican Engines
 are similar to these.  Anyone had any experiance with the Bosch 021
 Distributor?
 
 Best,
