Subject: Re: [VB] Gas Leak Leads

rob,i had a gass leak on my single cab one time, i
hadn't installed the ruber coller at thon the neck of
the gas tank properly,and it vibrated the neck so much
that it cracked the weld where the neck connects to
the tank, it would leak then when the gas would get
below the neck it was alright. j.b. weld fixed the
problem so far

&gt; Alright   For the last month I have had a gas leak
&gt; so today I pulled the
&gt; panels in the treasure chest to see what is up.  Gas
&gt; remnants all over under
&gt; the tank so I ask where is it leaking?  I pull the
&gt; cap off the plug and hear
&gt; the hiss of pressure in the tank so it can't be
&gt; leaking from the tank or the
&gt; filler.  Look under the bus and no leak at the
&gt; connection of hose to the
&gt; bottom of the tank.  Where is my gas leak coming
&gt; from?
