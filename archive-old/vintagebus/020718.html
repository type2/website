&gt; MY CHEAP_ASS SOLUTION:  I figure that instead of
&gt; trying to find a pilot tool for it I can tip the
&gt; engine on its front on a block of wood and have a
&gt; buddy hold the engine with the flywheel up in the air
&gt; level.

On a type 1 engine, this will result in a puddle of oil, since the 
engine has no rear (RIR) seal.

I've done it with the engine level.  It's not all that hard.
