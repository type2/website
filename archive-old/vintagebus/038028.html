If you look very closly on the later 60-67? bus wheels,
You can see little silver sparkles in the paint.
I had a NOS bus wheel a while back, you could see the sparkles when it hit 
the sun just right. I think the outter box said &quot;silver beige&quot;
I believe the early ones were ivory.

You can try emailing Teresa Koch (kochsvw_at_earthlink_dot_net)

&lt;&lt;?? the original paint on my '67 westy's steering wheel is off-white (similar
to the pearl white). Doesn't appear silver-beige, but then...??? Maybe we're
talking the same color.
