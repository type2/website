Subject: Re: [VB] Trip report, vapor lock

Hermine,

Thanks for the info. Could have been dirt, but I don't think so. The 15 gal
tank was coated with POR15 tank liner and a new screen was installed at the
tank exit. I will have to pull the top off the pump and check that screen too.

However, both times I had the problem, it seems that heat would have been
involved. Engine off and just sitting for 10 minutes the first time, idling in
90-95 F heat for about 5 minutes the second time.

Chris

    nah, insulating the fuel line will not do anything good. it seems to me,
going back to high school physicsair in the fuel lines ....here's the thought,
if no gas came out when your wife stepped on it, and you had it pulled free of
the carb....and then you fooled around with the fuel pump and then fuel
squirted out...why are you not thinking you had some kind of crapola in the
fuel line, and somehow dislodged it? some junk floating around in the fuel
tank which got loose and is plugging up on its journey, kind of like an
embolism, various parts of the fuel delivery system? eh?

    you want vapor lock, I can give you vapor lock. drive a real  Mini Cooper
in summer in Southern California. You know before they started making them
CHIC for export.
