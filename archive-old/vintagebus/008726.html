Subject: Battery Problem?

I'm having a problem with my son's 66 type 1. We both took our VW's to
Madison Wisconsin today for a show at the local VW dealer. I drove my 66
Westfalia and he drove his 66 1300 deluxe sedan.When we left this morning
his engine would barely turn over, the battery seemed weak or poorly
connected. We drove the 100 plus miles to Madison in daylight and the car
started fine four or five times through the course of the day. We drove home
tonight through some rain and the headlights were on for most of the way.
When he went out to start it an hour or so after we arrived home, once again
the battery appeared too weak to turn the engine over.
It was great to see his sedan in the rearview mirror and he really enjoyed
following my bus up to Madison and back, we got lots of waves and smiles
from other drivers and kids on the sidewalk. We are planning a longer trip
over Labor Day weekend but I want to get a handle on this problem first.
Does this sound familiar to anyone?
T.I.A.
John
