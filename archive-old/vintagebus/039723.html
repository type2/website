Subject: curtains and curtain rods ?

Howdy,
   A lady at work is going to sew some curtains for my 67 kombi/camper and I 
was wondering if anyone had any close up or detailed pictures showing what 
the curtain rods look like.  I was going to fabricate some and would like to 
get some ideas where to start before I give her the dimensions of the 
curtains I will need.  I don't care that much if they are stock or not.  She 
sewed some really nice bright parrot curtains for my old 69 westy with 
matching throw pillows.  It was a nice touch.

thanks,
Wayne Carlisle
'67 kombi
