&lt;&lt; My plan (Real Soon Now) is to get one of those red LED third-light units, 
a 6-to-12 converter, and mount it along the bottom of the rear window. &gt;&gt;
Hi Dworkin,
The problem is most fellow drivers out there do not pay attention to red 
taillights.  Once we installed Euro yellow topped taillights on our 1963 KG 
the constant getting flipped off every time we switched lanes on the highway 
went away.  For our buses we just mount a pair of small bullet style trailer 
tailights on the rear license plate frame and just wire them into the USA 
brake/turn signal wires.  So far over five plus years and sixteen states we 
have had no problems with any police with this set up and changing lanes is 
alot less white knuckle event.
