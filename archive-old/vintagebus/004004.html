&gt;A DOT approval would involve tests to prove so many cycles
&gt;of flex and so many panic stop pressures and so on . .
&gt;A pull test  to check the hose crimp .
&gt;
&gt;So while these braided brake lines don't seem to be falling
&gt;apart on anybody . . . they're not DOT approved . .
&gt;
&gt;Kind of takes the sparkle out of your eyes, don't it ?  :-)

After quite a tirade Mike fails to note or be aware that there are now quite
a few sources for DOT approved stainless braided teflon covered hoses,
started surfacing about a year back, no different than the others, just
somebody finally paid for the testing, always the big hurdle with a DOT,
FMVS, EO or whatever approval.  For buses, I have no idea for most of the
performance aftermarket, Japanese crap, A1, A2, A3, A4 VW's, american stuff
sure as hell are available, not much more expensive than the old &quot;non DOT&quot;
stuff either.  Having used those for years, I agree that in a cover your ass
litigious real world America situation they would come into question.  But
in reality, an entirely different place they are certainly drastically
superior to 20 year old rubber hoses.  However some racers don't care for
them BTW as they don't bend easily and have a nasty habit of rubbing against
things they shouldn't if not tied down, and abrasion equals death any way
round rubber or stainless braid.

So if you like the look, or if you want a drastically better pedal feel
(compared to 20 year old rubber, only marginally better than 5 year old
rubber lines) find a DOT approved set and put em on.  With all the FWD VW
stuff out there with correct sized fittings shouldn't be an impossible effor
to piece together a Bus set in near correct lengths.
