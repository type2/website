&gt;&gt;I like fridge handle better than ice pick. Who has these springs?  Gabe the key guy sold me some that were too small, he said to use two per handle, but the tangs on them are too short. 
These can't be too hard to find or spec to an existing part. If there isn't a good supply somewhere, I'll get a pile of 'em and some roll pins and be the fridge handle czar of the world, T1 and T2! 
&gt;&gt;
Ice pick sounds better, I like the idea of stabbing people who stand too close to my Bus.

I don't know where to get them but I just bought normal springs at the local hardware store of the same gauge, cut them in 1/2 and bent to match the original.  I'm not perfect so the tension is a tiny bit less than stock.
