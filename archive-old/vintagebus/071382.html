Subject: Re: Rear side window glass

Hello everyone

    It has been a while since I posted to the list. I sold my 67 deluxe a
couple of months ago and now I am working on my 65 deluxe and it has been
going pretty well up to this point. Well to make a long story short I busted
the stationary rear left window putting it back in this evening and I am
pretty upset at myself about it. I was wondering if any one out there would
have a spare window available for sale. I would be willing to buy two
because my other side window has a couple of scratches in it but if one is
only available that is my main priority at this time. Or if someone out
there knows of a good junk yard that might have one in the California area I
could get.


Thanks In Advance
Eric Lykens
