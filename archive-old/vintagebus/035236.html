&lt;&lt; Anyway.....here's the question....should I buy the engine for about $130, 
rebuild it (it my or may not need it...there was compression in all 
cylinders, but the whole thing was covered with oil...I'd rebuild it anyway!) 
 and keep it as a spare for my '67 Kombi &gt;&gt;
Hi Gene,
Sounds a little high.  Maybe more like a $100.00 for a complete engine with 
no known history would be more closer to the mark.  Though things out your 
way may just be higher $ than up here in the NW of USA.  By the way what year 
and type of Mazda did you get the washer system out of?   Eric&amp;Barb
