We would greatly appreciate any donations.  The raffle bus will be there (behind the Westfailure limo bus thing I believe) and there should be someone there to take the donations and take down your club name for the donation list.  If you can't find the bus find me, the guy with the rusty ragtop standard with Calvin and Hobbes on the door.  I will point you in the right direction.

Does anyone know who to contact at the ARizona Bus Club regarding donations 
for the double cab raffle? Our club has  parts to donate and would like to 
drop them off   ( if they are still needed) at the OCTO or Classic show this 
weekend. Thanks!
