Hey all - I had the great pleasure of meeting Jamie Rivers and his dad, Russ
last night.  There were enroute from Buses and Balloons back to Cambridge
Canada (around Ontario I guess) and so I got a phone call about 5:00 or so.
I was working on the 66 when they showed up.  We had a nice long multi-hour
chat about everything under the sun.  I also got to see his mint condition
74 Westy that he repainted.  All I can say is WOW!  Talk about damn near
rust free. :-)  He also won the longest distance traveled for the event
which was a bus speedo in a bus housing which was set to 1948 miles (the
distance they traveled).  I told Jamie if it came up missing, he'd know who
took it!   His bus also has a tach and a kph speedo in the dash.  That is
really wild - what I wouldn't give for that stuff. :-)

Anyway, Jamie did a tune up in the back yard where he camped.  I was able to
give him an OP sensor (his old one was leaking) and a rubber band to help
with worn carb linkage. :-)  In exchange, he gave me pocket multi-tool
embossed with his employers name (public utilities place.)  That was rather
cool as well.

I'm always fascinated by the Canadians - their accents, they way they say
words like &quot;out&quot; and &quot;about&quot; ( it's more the oot sound and not so much the
owt sound as the Americans say it), and their extreme kindness and stories
of free medical care all astound me.  It sounds like a nice place to live
although winter hits harder there I've heard.  Diana Krebs was the other
Canadian we had stop by and once again, total fascination - I enjoyed
chatting with her just as much as with Jamie and Russ.

If you get the chance, hang out with Jamie and Russ - I got a kick out of
both of them.
