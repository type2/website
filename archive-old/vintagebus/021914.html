Subject: [VB] need Saphire lock nuts

Hi,

Guess what I did last night. I removed the parcel tray, got out all my
wiring tools, dug out all the saphire III parts from the box, stuck it in
the dash and then discovered I was missing the locking nuts that screw onto
the posts. Anybody have these kicking around? They should be fairly easy to
mail I imagine. 

Hey speaker restoration guru's,

What aobut using liquid plastic (varathane) to restore the speaker instead
of woodworkers glue? Wouldn't that work?
