Hi Adrian,
Hmm, those we have made in a pinch out of cereral box cardboard with no 
leaks.  Never needed special impregnated gasket material for oil areas, only 
for fuel and exhaust areas.  The main thing about the sump plate is it has to 
be flat especially around the stud holes where are often warped due to 
overtorquring.  Then when installed, torqued on not too much or too little.
