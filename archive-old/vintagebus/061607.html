&gt;All this talk about the bad H-4s has gotten me worried.  I ordered a set of 
&gt;H4 upgrades about a year ago from The Bus Depot, all in preparation for my 
&gt;ongoing resto.  Now I am worried that I might have gotten a set of these 
&gt;poor-quality lights from India.  How can I tell for sure what lights these 
&gt;are (is there something as obvious as &quot;Made in India&quot; on them)?

******************************
If they're &quot;Autopal&quot; in a red box, they're most likely India made.  I had a
set on my Vanagon for a VERY short time - HORRIBLE low beam, very diffused
and irregular pattern, despite the glass fluting *trying* to imitate
Bosch/Hella units.  Excellent high beams though, if you wanna p*ss other
drivers off.  I crushed them up as soon as I installed Hella units.

I ran Cibie's on my ex-67 21 wdw deluxe for about 25 years, never a problem
with overheating wires or blinding drivers (ran 60/55 bulbs).  Best ones
I've used over the years on a 64 Notchback, 61 Panel, 59 Single Cab, 69
Camper, various Bugs and currently on my 84 Westy are Hella (PN 70476 -
still available).  Bosch looks like a carbon copy of the Hella and should
be just as good depending on the quality of the reflector.
