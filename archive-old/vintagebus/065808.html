Subject: Re: [VB] Link pin shim help

maybe it changed, maybe it was measured wrong before.   clean everything up 
and double and triple check your measurements, and shim it to your 
measurements.  This sets the spindles to the correct angle.

&lt;&lt; Hi,
 
 I am putting dropped spindles on my 63 single cab and I am confused about 
 the link pin shims. I used a straight edge and measured a 7 mm offset and 
 according to my idiot guide and the instructions with the spindles I should 
 use 5 shims on the outside and 3 on the inside. Why should this be different 
 then the way it was stock? It had 4 shims on each side of the link pin when 
 I took it apart why shouldn't I just put it back the way it was? Did 
 something change over time with my trailing arms and the offset is different 
 then when it was new?
 
 By the way I am using the same spindles that I took off the truck they were 
 rebuilt and lowered.
