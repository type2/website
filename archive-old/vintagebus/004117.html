I ran a T4 motor in my first sandrail (mid engine).  It was strapped to a
swing-axle tranny, and I never had any problems with this set-up.  I can
promise you nobody will put their bus through what that rail went through!

&gt; I was very curious about this conversion. But it sounded too good to be
&gt; true. So a while back, I emailed Bob Hoover for his input. He informed
&gt; me the tranny would not handle the torque. Since then, I have seen from
&gt; those that have attempted it, that Bob was correct. Even with the back
&gt; hanger, the tranny will very likely crack. Seems to me that, to do the
&gt; conversion, one must also put a type 4 tranny in the bus.
