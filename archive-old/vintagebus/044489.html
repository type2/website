&lt;&lt; It was a tight fit but I managed to get it installed without pulling the 
carb/fan shround/etc. only to find out that the generator bottoms out on the 
fan.  I think the fan for this generator is also a bit narrower to make up 
for the intrusion into the shroud so I'm gonna have to pull the generator 
back off and replace the fan.  &gt;&gt;
Hi NQ,
You have to setup the fan, and generator before installing into the shroud.  
With the correct amount of shims between the fan and the mounting piece on 
the generator shaft to get the proper .070&quot; spacing between the fan , and the 
generator sheet metal.  You can also install up to a 35mm, and possibly 
bigger fan in there with no problem.
