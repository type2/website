Good people of the list:

Trying to figure out if the white steering wheel is correct for my 65
Westfalia based on a Kombi.  The wheel, shifter and knob, and parking
brake handle and button were all ivory when I got the bus (very sad
shape at the time).  The bus is pearl white (L87).  I've seen L87 kombis
with black wheels and horn buttons, but they were not campers...at least
not Westfalias.

What would have been the correct wheel color and what type of horn
button would have come on it?  I've seen three different horn buttons.
Wolfsburg crest, plain ivory with black center, and all black.

Thanks for the anal retentive trivia folks.

Steve
