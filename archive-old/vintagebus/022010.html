Hi Brain,
Problem with white lithium grease it that it does not seal the rubber seal to 
either the glass or more importantly to the body.  Where water sits under the 
seal and rust the bosy frame there.  Tar will act as a lubricant and seal at 
the same time!  Also using any string runs you the risk of cutting the rubber 
in the tighter places.  Best to us automobile wiring with the insulation on 
it to pull it in just like VW did.   Eric&amp;Barb
