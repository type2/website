You are speaking of individuals.   I'm speaking about a corporate policy....big difference!
Individuals are what make up this hobby.  The corporation is what is trying to tear it apart.

I don't think many have a problem with your show.  I think most do have a problem with VWOA/AG pimping the vintage hobby to sell their new
product then, behind the scenes, trying to kill that same vintage scene.

&gt; Then will you boycott Bad Camberg because it is sponsored by Lotterman's a VW dealer as well as his son Stefan who is/was working at VWoA.
&gt;
&gt; Or Dave Crompton's Kubel or Schwimmer parts because he works as a consultant to VWoA and VW AG on some of their historical needs.
&gt;
&gt; How about Vince and Lynn Anderson who work at VWoa are club members and do many things that give recognition to the ACVW hobby.
&gt;
&gt; The guy who gave me a brand new parts fieche for my bus that worked at VWoA.
&gt;
&gt; The dealer guys that would search for obsolete stuff for me and do keys and locks for free if I brought them in.
&gt;
&gt; Flame me all you want but you need to come here and experince the show before you judge someone based on their leagl department.

&gt; VWoA is *using* the ACVW people who show up as poster children
&gt; to further their cause.   You're getting *tooled* by attending;
&gt; an unwitting PR prop, and like a drunk sorority girl, you'll be
&gt; dropped and forgotten until the next time you're needed.
