Subject: Re: [VB] Re: accelerator cable connection

 I agree with Matt... it depends which carb you run... 
if you run one with the spring between the top and the arm, you don't need the spring at the acc cable,
But if your carb has no spring on it, you need the spring at the cable.
 
On my 65 I run both styles of springs at once, becasue I have an accessory 'bare foot' on the gas pedal, and it needs extra springage, or the weight of the lead foot revs the engine even without my foot on the gas pedal.

As far as I know, you can run either setup - the determining factor is 
probably the carb. If the carb doesn't have the extra arm for the 
throttle return spring, you need the kind like in the link that goes 
around the cable. If the carb does have the extra arm, you just need a 
spring between that arm and the throttle arm.
