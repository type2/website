10 times faster?  That seems a stretch.  It *is* a lot faster now that
I'm doing real thumnailing for the gallery images, one of which shows
up on the main page.

Sometimes it's slow, sometimes it isn't.  I think my ISP needs to do a little
work on their web server.  They web server is also one of the shell
access machines, so the load at a given time is completely unpredictable.

As a test, I just wiped my cache and tried both, and they seemed pretty
even, or maybe a tick faster on mine.  That *could* be a geographical thing.

&gt; Why does Everett's page load 10 times faster than Thom's.  I look at them at home (28.8 ughh!) and from work (T1) and its the same from both places, although the T1 is naturally faster than my dial up, Everett's site is signifiacantly faster than Thom's.
