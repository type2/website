Hey ya'll,

Has anyone seen the white over orange splittie in the CD Now
commercial?  Looks like a pre-63 13 window.  Multiple shots of it,
probably long enough to get some really good looks at if you recorded it
and played it back a couple of times - pointing out different things to
your 4 year old daughter.  Then have her ask &quot;I wonder if it's a
walk-through or a bench seat?&quot; - only to have me reply &quot;I don't know&quot; to
which she says  &quot;Let's play it back again to see.&quot;  Ah, what am I doing
to my daughter?
