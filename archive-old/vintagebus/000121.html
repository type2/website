My guess is that the word &quot;invest&quot; is not a proper word to use in these cases.
&quot;Spent&quot; seems to fit rather well. Ill see your 75$ and raise you to 76$.

Like any custom car, it totally depends on how likely someone
else is to appreciate the customization, and how much they'd pay for it.
That's it.  You can sink $50k into a super duper chopped, channeled, tubbed,
fire breathing hot rod, but that doesn't make it worth $50k.  Most
people have a hard time selling their custom creations, and the 
classifieds are full of &quot;invested $XX,XXX - must sell - $X,XXX&quot;

Personally, I wouldn't give him $100 for it.  Maybe $75.
