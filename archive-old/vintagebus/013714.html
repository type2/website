I've had several people ask me if we could force the list name into
the subject of messages, to make sorting easier.  I figured out how
to do it, and implemented it.

We'll see how it goes.  If it screws something up (list-wise, not on
your end) then I'll look at changing it back, but otherwise I think
it's here to stay.  The type2 list is their own group, and they
may or may not want to follow suit
