Subject: Need tow dolly in NC (Raleigh)

Howdy. I was wondering if anyone in NC, preferably near Raleigh, but I
can drive to get it, has a tow dolly I could borrow in a couple weeks.
I've got to pick up a vanagon, so the usual tow bar won't work. Tow   
vehicle is a 1978 Dodge truck, but the vanagon will have a happy new  
home with my other aircooleds.                                        
Please drop me a line if you can help out.                            
Thanks,
