&gt;. Also told me how putting a 1600 in a
&gt;50's bus is just as bad as a Chevy motor.

Hmmmm.....    Cutting and hacking a Chevy motor into a bus, a modification
that can probably be never reversed.  OR  a straight bolt-up of a 1600 in to
a barn-door bus, requiring no modification.

Which do YOU think is worse?????
