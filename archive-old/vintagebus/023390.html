Hey guys...

I took my Sealing Wax Red '59 panel to the Vintage show/picnic in Rockford, 
IL today... I couldn't make the campout so got up bright and early to make 
the trip from Peoria. The bus ran great all 350 miles in 80 plus degrees of 
heat. This was the first show and significant trip for my freshly restored 
panel and it went unexpectedly well... I walked away with 1st in class 
(Split-bus) and best Paint for the entire show:) The trophy's were gorgeous 
handmade hardwood pieces that contain removable carved and  inlaid bud vases. 
Someone put alot of hard work into those!
Thanks to the Stateline Volks Folks for putting on a nice get together!!!
I had a great time and urge all the midwest folks to go next year ... See you 
_at_ the Hoosier show the 29th and 30th!!!
Happy as a schoolgirl:),
--Pete
