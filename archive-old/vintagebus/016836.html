Subject: rgb outer axle seal

Hey all,

I was in process of changing my outer axle seal on my rear passenger side 
big nut.  Upon disasembly I notice it had 3 gasket seals...my kit only had 
1!   Lukily I had 2 kits (one kit had 2 gaskets?) and put him back together 
and stopped the leak.  My wheel has some drag now even with the shoes backed 
off.  I just stuck the outter bearing and used the 4 nuts to tourqe it down. 
  Is it easy to get the outter rear bearing put in out of allignment?  Any 
ideas.  I ended up putting a gasket on the outer rgb case and 2 between the 
backing plate and 4 bolt casking thing under the adjusting stars.  I put a 
small rubber donut seal on the axle stub on top ofg the 4 bolt casting.  add 
put a big washer under the 46mm bolt.  Didn't have one originally but the 
kit did and that was the only place it fit.  I only have like 4 miles at low 
speed on this fix so if you could let me know what to check without doing 
damage and possible maintaining the new seal let me know.

Thanks in advance,

Eric
