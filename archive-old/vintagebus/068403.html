Subject: Re: [VB] Fuse Block

I use early bay window's fuse blocks for my 53 &amp; 59.  I have them converted
to 12V, since finding 6V parts here in Indonesia is very hard.  So is
finding original fuse blocks.

Now  I have tail lights, brake lights &amp; blinkers (even the semaphore
blinks), and very bright head lights.

 Driving them at night are much saver...:)

&gt; &gt; Another question about my '67. I don't want to put the original fuse
block
&gt; &gt; back in and was wondering if anyone had a suggestion for an aftermarket
block
&gt; &gt; using modern type fuses?
&gt;
&gt; What's your logic for not wanting to use the original?
