Subject: Re: [VB] Belly Pan
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com, evens_at_magnet_dot_com

&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Actually the front pan is a splash pan. Just for clarification Barndoors 
are
the only years that I know of that have factory splash pans. The belly pan is
for Deluxe and any type of double door bus throughout the split years.
You could make one but it doesn't need it.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

 I think all should have the splash pan  up front as dworkin stated ,and as 
for the belly pas ( support pans under the cargo area floors ,,) its not 
limited to Deluxes and Double Doors, it applies also to Standard Sunroof 
buses, (ie the 56 sunroof on the web pages had them ,,yea the one with the 
jungle jim looking braces inside it )  and alot of the westies had  but that 
might have been the bays with the big hole in the roof ,,Later
