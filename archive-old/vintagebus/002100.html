Hey NQ,

Your young yet. Just save your money and be patient. It will never be as
nice as a real Double cab!  So, how much do ya want for the 66?

PS Why don't you get the Fairlane up on blocks out of the back yard so you
can get the vw bus off the back porch, Just a suggestion. Haw haw!

Thanks,

Kevin Sullivan

&gt; I have my old 66 13 window deluxe (rusty special) sitting out on the back
&gt; porch and I've actually envisioned it as a DC.  Right now I'm just pipe
&gt; dreaming and thinking of various alternatives to getting a double cab
&gt; (remember - on a budget!!!).  I think making a DC is a neat idea
&gt; but I hate
&gt; conversions where it looks like Jethro and the boys drug out there
&gt; arcwelders and had a good time.
