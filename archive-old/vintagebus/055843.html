Subject: Headlight Bucket Scribbling &amp; Fuel Gauge Q

I took apart my headlights tonight to replace the seals... in the passenger
headlight bucket I found a piece of old paper stuck to it.  I've no idea
what it says except for the numbers.  Anyone know??

Also, my bus is a 61...vin # 778627.  It has a fuel gauge.  I see no
evidence of it being cut in, the hole appears factory, no warping or paint
chips around the hole, the wire for the sender appears original, and with
the amount of old dust/grime on the tank...I would assume it is original to
the bus too and it has the cutout for the sender (and a sender of course)
and no fuel reserve cable hole.  Just a gas heater control, regular heat
control, and a choke cable (I would assume)...on the right (electric choke
carb now)
Is this just a one off? or?  Its an SO-34 westy...could it have something to
do with being a westy?  I'm not sure what # they started the gauges at, but
i thought it was 62.  Mine is May 16 1961.  The fuel gauge says &quot;zoll&quot; or
something for full..I forget exactly what it says, but its not like the
&quot;normal&quot; gauge.
Just curious...

Thanks
Isaiah
