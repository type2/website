Subject: Speaker wire path(s)

Hi everybody,

I am at the point in my reassembly that I have many of the pieces that I
need to fit this puzzle together, but not the control to do one thing at a
time.  Oh well.

One thing I am up against is where to put the speaker wires in my Westy.  A
PO had already put speakers on the front of the upper rear cabinet, and
since the holes are already there, I might follow suit.  For the fronts,
I'll probably mount little angled speakers underneath the parcel tray.
That's relatively easy, but what I don't see clearly is the best path from
the cassette/radio I just got from Ronnie to the rear speakers.  I bought 30
ft. of Monster 4-conductor 16 gauge for the rears, thinking that one run
would be better....so how do I do this without drilling lots of 3/8&quot; size
holes?

Thanks..

Gene Cornelius
