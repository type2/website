Subject: Re: The answer - Steering Wheel Removal
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com


I found a great way to get these off...and it is easy!

First remover the nut and spray WD40, PB Blaster or some similar type of 
penetrating lube around the shaft/steering wheel hub connection.  Then get a 
MAPP gas torch like what you use for soldering copper pipes and heat up the 
steering wheel hub (not the shaft) for a minute or so.  Keep the heat on the 
&quot;wings&quot; from the inner to outer hub a lot, especially the large one.  Bang on 
the bottom of the wheel with your *hands* and it will pop off in a few solid 
blows.  Keep some water handy to cool off the hub.

FWIW, after at least a dozen wheels I have never caught a bus on fire or 
discolored a wheel.
