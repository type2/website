Bob and All;

Someone mentioned an array of heater cores.....

Commercial vessels, and quite a few pleasure cruisers, use a system
called a keel cooler.  In its simplest form it's just a couple of runs of
metal pipe/tubing lying lengthwise along the boat's bottom, just above
the keel, functioning as a heat exchanger.

Perhaps a similar arrangement, it's efficiency enhanced by the addition
of longitudinal fins, would do the job on an H2O-cooled conversion to a
Type 2.

FWIW.....

&gt;Do a gopher search for 'roadcow' -- a 1971 Type II with a Toyota 3AT

&gt;
&gt;I hope I can come up with something a bit less...  dramatic :-)
