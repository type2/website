Hi all, 

I've been very busy lately getting ready for BBTA #14.  The flyers 
are in the mail to those on our database.  Henry DeKuyper has 
confirmed that he's coming to cover this unusual Type 2 event for 
&quot;VW TRENDS&quot;, in fact he'll be living the experience in my '67 
Westfalia.  He owns a '66 Bus.  He'll not only cover the event itself, 
but will be shooting a few Busses for future features in the magazine.  
Brian Holcomb and Dawn Stokesberry are completing the details 
of they're Sat evening &quot;wedding&quot; (everyone's invited).  The infamous 
D.B.G. Bus Club from the Milwaukee area are supposed to be 
bringing a complete &quot;live band&quot; for their &quot;tavern&quot; theme campsite!  
Woo Hoo!!!   I'm about to order the trophies and we're ordering 
professional porta-potties in our private camping area for those late 
night urges.  The response so far has been huge, so I'm predicting 
that we'll host approximately 150-plus Type 2's over the long 
holiday weekend.

I've still got a couple of folks I need to send a flyer to, but I don't
have 
their complete or new addresses.  If you know of them and can send 
their current pmail addresses to me PRIVATELY - not to this List - 
please do!  I need 'em for Bill Carpenter of the Memphis area, 
Dr. &quot;Mac&quot; Jones also of the Memphis area, a Listee by the name of 
Nathan Dennison, and the new address in North or South Carolina for 
Glen Lavelle, formerly of Dallas, TX.  Thanks for any help with these.  

If anyone is planning on attending and doesn't think they are already 
on our event flyer mailing list and wants to be, send your pmail 
address, phone #, VW clubs you belong to, and a list of the VW's 
you covet to us privately - not to the List.  We'll get one out to you 
quickly!

We're looking forward to seeing all of our old and new friends streaming 
into the &quot;Busses By The Arch&quot; Campground during the upcoming Labor 
Day holiday weekend, Sept 4-7th, 1998.  Pay no attention to weather 
forcasts if they aren't excellent, because this group shows up and 
parties no matter what happens.  Save your &quot;bad&quot; cases, and we'll 
see ya sooner than you think!.
