Subject: What ya gots in your parcel tray?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Contents of my parcel tray is probably about 3/4 of
what I own.

The highlights are:
Open package of three snapped off 7/64&quot; - 2,78mm (sic)
Agressor by Blu-mol brand drill bits. (snapped like
matchsticks), 1.5oz of 11/16&quot; yellow zinc plated
#45654 linoleum nails, a sticker with a trailer on it
with lettering that says &quot;WHITE TRASH&quot;
(vwextreme_dot_com), a purple X-Acto knife with trusty #11
blade, 3/4&quot;x3/4&quot; 90 degree PVC elbow, a buttload of
thin nylon string all wound up ready for use, Discount
Tire guarantee folder, matchbooks from when I smoked
and weighed 20lbs less, three ear plugs, 2 church keys
of differing styles, measurements for a yet to be
completed wood project which I have forgotten about,
2-11mm and 1-13mm wrenches, a small carb adjusting
screw driver, former contents of a neosporin mini-tube
that jizzed out of the tightly sealed container during
the 120 degree interior temps, a cheap assed dash
plaque from &quot;Flakey Frank-o-Rama #1&quot;, the
miscellaneous UFO crap that the neosporin mixed with
and three used wiper blades. And what's this...? Oh,
jeez! I need to clean the parcel tray.
