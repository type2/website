Subject: Re: [T2] Puyallup Spring Meet - trip report

From gns.wagnon:
 
We (3 buses - me and my
buddy in my '63 Panel/Camper, father in law in his '67 13 window Standard, and
Sister-in-law w/guest in one of their '66 Standard/Campers) drove up Saturday
to camp with the Wet Westies at Dash Point. 
&lt;snip&gt;
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
I am very puzzled seeing a bus listed as a '67 13 window Standard'.
Aren't 64-67 13 window buses hardtop Deluxes? 
Aren't all Standards 11 window buses?
A 13 window Deluxe will have the vin starting with 24xxxxxxxx.
A 11 window Standard will have the vin starting with 22xxxxxxxx.

Do you have 22 Standard with the rear side windows from a Deluxe installed?
