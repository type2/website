'54 Deal-Part 4: Final Analysis
(Enough already! Tell me about the darned bus!)
Shawn encouraged me to get on with it...


1954 VW Ambulance
VIN 20075178
36hp Eng #  -122-039973- *understood to be/may not be correct/original*
Currently in Phoenix, AZ USA
Owner: Jim Ellis
MOT = = Ministry of Transportation (or Danish equivalent)

Paint is nicely applied and shiny Navy Gray (Mouse Gray?) with Black top and
along the belt-line continuing onto the front &quot;V&quot; area. Black bumpers. Gray
wheels. Gray Barndoor front symbol (three posts not four). Paint and body is
in overall pretty nice shape ~ especially considering that it came from an
area which is ideal for cultivating rust. All five 16&quot; wheels are there. The
spare is mounted on the rear windowless gurney door. Functioning semaphores
are installed in the bus. A spare pair of semaphores in excellent condition
were included. The semaphores do need a little tweaking but work. Front
visor(less) area has an optional exterior &quot;Ambo&quot; fresh air roof scoop with
electric fan inside. Clara or someone could verify that this might not be
specifically an ambulance item. I think that it might have been a factory
option available for other barn era buses but is most commonly seen on old
ambulances. The bus sale included the glass divider, spare large SEKURIT
glass panes for front windshields (2 pieces) and side both main pieces for
the side window (4 pieces). Wing vents are not the really early piano hinged
style. Front and rear ribbed bumpers are in excellent shape with an apparent
MOT required quasi-tasteful turn signal lights mounted on the front bumper
via little brackets. Front bumper also has a pair of bad assed looking
vintage era Hella driving lights mounted to the bumper brackets. Headlights
are the correct Euro lenses with the open beam lights. Front windshields are
rare &lt;real&gt; Barn safaris! Front rubber mat is in the bus and is in a 6.5-7.0
condition on a 10 scale.  A back up spot light is mounted to the left hand
side, rear roof painted to match. It's LHD not the wished for RHD. Interior
has been fitted with a fairly nice camper kit that is in pretty good
condition for what it is. All floors look dry and solid. Time will tell...
Later model splittie popouts in the rear windows with shorty latches. Engine
is 36hp hand crank nut/apron with the actual crank on board. Rear tail
lights are correct with nice reflectors below. Small tail lights that
resemble a one piece plastic copy of a 356 beehive tail light have been
installed above the bubble tail lights. One mythical guru kiddingly
mentioned that they are probably Pepboy's of Denmark Circa 1960's. These
look like they were installed for the MOT regs...
The bus started right up at the dock and drove fine onto the trailer and at
home off of the trailer. Dead battery the following evening. I might have
left something on or it was just a crapped out battery. Motor purred and
tranny shifted nominally fine for a rookie driver.

Downsides? (if you can call them that):
A smaller poptop has been cleanly installed into the roof with perfectly
fine canvas in place. A Disco era RV style Plexiglas air vent/moonroof sits
over a hole immediately behind the poptop. Given time and the funds, I might
have this bus returned to a hardtop. I kind of hate seeing a poptop Barn but
it doesn't look that offensive. Otherwise it looks &quot;OK&quot;. Some random signs
of minor rust here and there. Tires are weathered but not too bad to drive
on for awhile, clutch seems weak, engine is puking oil out of the overflow
drain down tube like there is no tomorrow after only a very short test
drive. I anticipate some work. Under carriage is greasy and oily in areas.
(But isn't rusty!) The interior panels are made out of raw Masonite. Paula
likes them as is and thinks that they go well with the old &quot;Butch&quot; look of
the bus. I picked up ten sheets of the White Baltic Birch thinking that I'd
redo the Masonite with the real wood to match the rest of the camper
furniture. Some friends and acquaintances think that they would remove/fix
the poptop, the rear spare, and the rear facing spot light. Some wiring in
the separate 12V radio system is very scary and will probably go away.
Clutch and brakes are in need of service.

Generally:
I am going to service and clean the hell out of it and drive it as is for
now. I think that it can be a bad idea to charge ahead and start changing a
bunch of stuff before the bus and I know each other. The bus will not very
likely become a concours emergency vehicle so I'll enjoy it as is. My
intentions are to correct the obvious and run it. For being a bit of a
Frankenstein is very very cool. Its not your typical primered and rusted mid
60's standard. Vintage purists be damned - it is one of 24 known in the
world. I am thrilled to have it. =)
