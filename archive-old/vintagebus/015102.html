That makes sense, although I've never seen it happen before.  I
suspect the full-closed position isn't always attained by
less-than-healthy carbs....

It seems fairly correct, and it took several full-throw throttle
cycles to get any leakage to occur, so I think I'll go with the closed
plate theory for now.  I've found someone locally that does full carb
rebuilds (bushings, etc), so I'm going to give it to him to work out
for now.  I'll repeat the experiment with the rebuild and see what
happens.

Thanks for the insights.
