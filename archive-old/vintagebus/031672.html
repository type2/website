 Windshield seal NEWS FLASH. I met with my German rubber supplier this
weekend and have convinced him there is a demand for GERMAN pre 67 seals, so
coming soon, FORMED (molded) windshield seals, also pop out window outside
scrapers. After these are done we will work on the body seals and eventually
a complete line of molded seals for our buses.

I will keep the list informed.

When I removed the corner-windows on my '54, I found pieces of such wire,
and I don't think they'd ever been removed before.
