--part1_c9.273e2a40.2a9a52bb_boundary

Hey there all,

My transmission (1965 Type II) has recently begun to drip quite a lot of gear 
oil from the boots.  I thought there was only grease in there!  I had the 
original style boots replaced about year ago with the bolt on kind, are they 
junk or OK?  The tranny was 're-sealed' about three years ago and when I 
bought it about a year and half ago I found the tranny overfilled with 90 wt. 
 I let some out and have had no other troubles since, until recently.  What's 
up with gear oil in the boots?  Are we talkin' major repairs?  

Thanks for your help,
Arthur
65 DC
