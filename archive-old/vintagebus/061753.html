Thought I cc'd this to the list but didn't.  For anyone else curious.

===============
Wade,

Looks like you have a version of what is sometimes called a &quot;stationary
55/56&quot; Eberspacher heater.  Consider yourself lucky as it looks all
there and is a good factory install.  I've restored one or two of the
bus versions of these.  When I get some extra time I'll dig out what
manuals I have and copy them for you.   Someone down the line did it for
me and I'd like to share.  The black areas with the wires is the fuse
terminal.  Never seen one broken up in to two separate sections, but
yours is a bit different than the ones I've worked on.  All the parts are
the same, but in different places.  

I've seen a few pictures of one of the early ones installed where yours
is, so I know it is where they put DC and single cab heaters.

I'm late for work, but here are some pics I had Ron Vaness put up on T2
a long time ago.

Here is a brochure someone else posted...bus and not truck, but you see
the similarities.  Hey!  Just noticed this is your heater...look at the
fuse block.

Read all the gas heater stuff as most of it will relate to the very
basic operation and restoration of the early heaters.  The fuel pump is
usually what does not work on these things.  Contact Rick as someone
else mentioned or the other gas heater gurus off the list.  As a last
resort, I might be able to help if you are desperate.  Cool to actually
see one installed like that.  If it was cold where I'm at I'd build and
install one.  

Steve

&gt; Ive looked all thru the library at type2_dot_com and i dont see a pic of this
&gt; anywhere. I hear everyone talking about BN4 and BNH  but mine doesnt even
&gt; seem to match those. All similar tags that i found in the type 2 library
&gt; have totally different information then mine. Only thing i can figure out
&gt; from the tag is thats its a 6volt. It is original to my 58 binz and
&gt; everything is screw terminal connections. Also is it unusual for the heater
&gt; to be mounted where the spare goes? Ive never seen it and i assume that big
&gt; T tube is extra special.
&gt; 
&gt; heres a few pics

&gt; (that weird thing on the wires where they attach to the black box in the
&gt; first pic, looks kind of like a connector or something,  its just a big
&gt; piece of broken glass laying there)
&gt; Can take more pics if necessary
&gt; Any help appreciated
