Anyway, I drove for a week with oil-filled up front and gas
on the rear and then decided to put on oil-filled to see if
there was a difference.  The oil-filled are Monroe LE10002
shocks (Barndoor-suitable super short shocks).  The gas
were KYB Gas-A-Just &quot;lowered shocks&quot; as my Barndoor has
shorter-than-normal rear shock travel.
