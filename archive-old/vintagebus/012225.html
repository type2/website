&gt; I replyed a minute ago before reading this, but I will stick with the 
&gt; idea that heater boxes CAN be welded! When the heat is off, the hot
air 
&gt; goes through the bypass, not the gaps (or at least it shouldn't) in
the 
&gt; box itself. If I misunderstood the previous post, and that is
possible, 
&gt; I am only talking about the box to j tube seam, not the bypass. Its
just 
&gt; a matter of cheap manufacture. Press fit seams that work OK, but not 
&gt; welded down. In addition, the little bit of play in the j tube
relative 
&gt; to the box allows for some room of error on installation of the
exhaust 
&gt; port and the tin below.

I've done something similar.  The holes on my stock exchangers had
&quot;egged out&quot; somewhat, so I made a 2cm wide split ring to go into the
gap and brazed it into place.  This closed the gap and made a wide
bearing surface so that the holes wouldn't egg out again.  I didn't
think of welding the box to the pipe, as the disparate thicknesses
were beyond my abilities with ox-acet equipment.
