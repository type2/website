&lt;&lt; Hi- On my 61 standard bus I was going to replace the shift rod guide
 bushing (or sleeve).  When I tried to undo the coupler with the two
 square headed screws, one of the square heads was broken off, I guess by
 a PO.  After struggling to loosen the other square headed screw I had the
 great pleasure of breaking it off as well.  (It was a team effort between
 me and the PO =o).  So my question is, where do I go from here?  Is there
 some way to get the broken pieces of screw out or have they permanently
 welded themselves to the shift rod?  Thanks for any help you can offer.

I had a similar experience with my 61 with the 2 screw  front shift coupler.  
except that one screw was missing (I had driven this bus to MOntana and back- 
twice, as well as around town ) and the other one broke off.  I tried torches 
and etc etc etc and finally I took a grinder to it and cut it in half.  of 
course, I had some left on each half, getting the bit off the front half was 
easier as I could removed from unde rthe car entirely.   any way, WW does 
have repro 61 type frotn shift coupler, though the wierd thing I found was 
that the ID on one side was larger than the ID on the other, seemed a little 
wonky. It did work though.

I cut a line the length of the coupler, and one around it.  then another one 
the length of the coupler.  actually I could not go all the way around it 
cause of logistics, but I cut it off there somehow.
