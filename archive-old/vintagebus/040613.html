I haven't even seen those.  And yea it would kind of defeat the purpose of
buying a 1&quot; breaker bar.

I know you'd be sacrificing strength,but couldn't he just get a 1&quot; to 3/4&quot;
reducer ?

&gt; &gt; .  I bought a 1 inch breaker bar but now I'm
&gt; &gt; having trouble finding sockets.  I found one place that had sockets but
&gt; &gt; a 36mm was $28!   Anyone
&gt; &gt; know of a place to buy 1 inch sockets?
&gt;
&gt; WOW!  1-inch drive!  What a man!
&gt;
&gt; When you get up to 1-inch you are getting out of the &quot;consumer&quot; catagory,
&gt; so you're stuck with industrial suppliers.
