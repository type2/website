Thanks E&amp;B,

Yes its attached with insulating brackets to the left side of the fan 
shroud.
It is not resting on the left heat riser, however it is very close to the 
left dual port intake casting.
Maybe a rerouting away from the casting might help.

 Do you have the fuel line bracket bolted to the left side of the fan 
shroud?
Plus make sure the metal fuel line is not resting on the left heat  riser.
