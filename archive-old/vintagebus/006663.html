I have the same toy! When I bought the '54
&quot;Barnambulator&quot; ambulance/camper the previous owner
included a toy that was customized to look just like
the full scale bus! =) Mine too is a barndoor but has
been altered to have a poptop section and an ambo
fresh air chingus on the front. The only thing
different from the full scale bus is the spare tyre
&lt;Its a Euro toy...&gt; was not affixed to the arse end.
My toy was painted by hand to reflect the black over
gray paint scheme. Front emblem is missing but has two
teensy holes where one would go. I suggested scale
punks ripped it off. =)
For once I am not exagerating. I seriously wish that I
had a digital camera to quickly provide proof.
Since the toy looks like the real bus I wondered if it
would take nine months to sell the toy too? ;-)
