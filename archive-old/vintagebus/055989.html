Well, fluids all changed out on the '65 and replaced using the nuts and =
bolts method.
My search for the same tools only took 47 seconds, but to get them here=20
would have taken a week, and since I had the day off, and the wheels =
off, I wanted=20
to do it now.  Yes, Sears had the 17mm allen for $8.00, and if I had =
seen the snap-on
guy while driving, I would have stopped him. I searched the archives for =
any mention of
someone else sharing this, and found none.(didn't want to waste =
bandwidth)=20
I then posted the original so it would be easy to find in the archives, =
and maybe help someone else out in a pinch. Geez, it sounds like in the =
meantime, I made myself into a webdummycheapskate.  I don't care though, =
because I am a cheapskate, and
a splittie alot of people would have chopped up now rolls and stops.
