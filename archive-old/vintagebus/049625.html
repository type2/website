Subject: kickboard material?

Has anyone used Poly-Max poly board for kickpanels, etc?
A polyethelene panel, it comes in 1/8&quot;, 1/10&quot;, 5/32&quot;, 3/16&quot; and 1/4&quot;
thicknesses; cost seems to run $20-30 from Teksupply...
While the Deluxe folks prolly don't want shiny, washable white sufraces,
but it sounds pretty good for truck kick panels!

Teksupply has some great bus potential...  the pig feeding mat looks
perfect for the cargo area! They also sell everything from quonset huts to
clamps to make 'garages' out of galvanized electrical conduit.

no affiliation, etc
