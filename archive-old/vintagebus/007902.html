Subject: Inside details on the Texas 7.

I know this is an OTP but I think that in light of the recent discussions
here and there concerning the Texas 7 in Woodland Park, CO where Rocky
Mountain Motorworks is located, it might be of interest to you.

My workmate buddy brother is a trooper in Colorado Springs.  He is also on
the SWAT Team and was called to duty to help with their apprehension.  He
put in 22 hours of overtime throughout the ordeal.

Anyway, the part I found kind of interesting is that in the van that hauled
the SWAT team members on site, one of the SWAT guys inadvertantly snagged
the pin to the flash-bang device and set it off in the van.  That guy was
the least injured - suffering ringing ears and singed vest.  The rest of the
guys had hearing problems and various other maladies related to the setting
off of an incedinary device in a confined space.

I found it interesting to hear a story from the inside - one which we might
have never heard.

The ob-vw is that this happened in Woodland Park where RMMW hosts their
show.  I'm going this year - anyone else?
