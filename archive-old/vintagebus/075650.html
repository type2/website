Subject: Re: Voltage regulator hook up

&gt;From: John Baker &lt;harmony_at_buszen_dot_com&gt;

&gt;
&gt;I bought a new voltage regulator (for 67-68 bus) but there is only one
&gt;terminal on the VR which is labelled. The labelled says &quot;D+&quot;, but the
&gt;othe 3 terminals have no labels. There is a small push on term on the
&gt;same end as the D+. Then on the other end there is a bigger 2 prong
&gt;push on terminal and a smaller single one.

You probably have done this already, but look on the bottom.  Sometimes
the terminals are marked under there.

Historically, on the regulators that go on the right of the engine
compartment, the two connections to the generator were on one end of
the regulator and the two connections to the body were on the other
end.  Going by that, on one end of the regulator, you will have the 3/8&quot;
wide D+ (generator output) terminal, and the 1/4&quot; wide DF (generator
field) terminal.  On the other end, you will have the 3/8&quot; wide dual
B+ (battery) terminal, and the 1/4&quot; wide 61 (warning light) terminal.
The regulator also grounds through its mounting &quot;feet&quot;, so make sure
the screws are tight, and maybe use a star washer under one screw
head.
