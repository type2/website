Subject: Sandblast vs. media blast?

Hello List,

   Can anyone recommend either of the two methods of stripping down my bus
inside and out?  I was going to media blast but the wait time for the only
guy where I live is too long to wait for..  I was thinking about
sandblasting instead?   Does anyone think this is not a good idea for the
metal?  I'm told it will take some metal with it?  

As always, any input is much appreciated.    --- JD
