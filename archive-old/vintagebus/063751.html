&gt;&gt;I've read before about the '67 air cleaner pre-heat hose running
forward through the front tin to the heat exchanger, but I remain
unclear on what is exactly meant. (My '67 has a '73 beetle 1600DP in it
right now.)&lt;&lt;

&gt;&gt;Does the hose (1) actually run to the heat exchanger itself, which
must have a non-standard port on it for the hose to connect to? In other
words, does it actually take warmed fresh air from inside the heat
exchanger? &lt;&lt;

The paper/foil pre-heater hose runs to the heat exchanger to a &quot;port&quot;
which is just above the header pipe coming from #1 cylinder exhaust
port, just below the clam-shaped heat exchanger vent (where the heated
air goes when it doesn't go through the tubes to heat the bus).  Because
I have three '67s, I guess I've come to look at it as standard. 
Actually, both of my heat exchangers have the port (both left and right)
and they came with a cap to tap on the one that didn't need the port for
the pre-heater.  Mine are Dansk, and five-plus years old. So, yes, it
does actually take warmed fresh air from inside the heat exchanger.

&gt;&gt;OR does it (2) run forward and connect to an intake pipe that bolts to
the heat exchanger and is in the engine-cooling airflow?&lt;&lt;

I haven't spent much time on pre-'67s, but I do understand that there is
a pipe that bolts/screws to the exchanger for picking up pre-heated air.
  Exactly where I don't know.  I take it to be the part you describe to
Tom below.

&gt;&gt; In either case, the front (FIF) tin must have a 1-inch hole in its
right side, making it different from other years. And, in Case #1, the
heat exchanger must also be a unique design for this year, so where does
one get a suitable replacement?&lt;&lt;

The front tin does have a ~1-inch hole (and a rubber grommet) on the
right side aligned with the port on the heat exchanger.  There are a lot
of '67-only parts, that may be one of them.  My Parts List was put out
in 65-66 and doesn't have all the '67-only parts listed.  It's been
several years since I bought heat exchangers, so I'm not sure what's
available now.  I'd ask Ronnie at Old Volks Home to find out if the new
ones have this feature.

&gt;&gt; the way, Tom, it looks like your pre-heat hose just hangs open at its
lower end. It should run down through the rear tin to a 1-inch intake
pipe that gets bolted to the lower, left-rear area of your engine, to
grab engine cooling air on its way out of the tin. Listees in the past
have posted URLs for on-line pictures of two types of these -- I just
don't have the URLs handy right now.&lt;&lt;

I looked at Tom's photo and knew it had to go somewhere.  It also looks
like the rear tin has the wrong size hole, that is, too big.  One of
these days I'm going to have to find something other than a '67 to work
on to see what I've been missing.  Love my 12-volt stock system!
