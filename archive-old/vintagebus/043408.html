&gt;I actually have a weird problem with my flashers...when i turn them on
&gt;they work fine, but if i step on the brake the warning lights in the
&gt;speedo start flashing and i think the gas gauge alternates between on
&gt;and off...any ideas on that one?

Sounds like maybe a ground is missing or the wires are mixed up at
the speedometer.  When you say &quot;warning lights&quot; do you mean the
generator and oil lights, high beam light, turn signal arrow, or
what?  Normally the illumination and high beam lamps are grounded
to the speedometer shell, and powered by the dash light switch
and dimmer switch respectively.  The oil and generator lights
and the turn signal arrow light are powered by the ignition switch
with the key on, and their other lead is grounded to turn them on.
This hot-with-key wire also powers the fuel gauge, so if somebody
mixed up the wires it could affect the gauge too.  

First, carefully check your wiring, particularly the turn-signal 
switch, hazard switch, flasher, and speedometer against the diagrams
at http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/ (thanks Thom!!).  If your wiring
is all OK, and you have a '66-up US-spec Bus, the trouble could
be in the dreaded nine prong box.  But I think it's more likely
that you have something miswired in the speedometer.

Good luck!
