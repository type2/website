To: volkser7_at_yahoo_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

hey all,
i am installing a new generator and voltage regulator,
after i do this how do i go about &quot;polorizing&quot; them?

.......
use a battery or  battery charger charger   = hook up the +  of the battery 
to the  B+  of the generator - where the thick red wire goes, and the - 
terminal of the  battery to the body of the generator somewhere.  you can do 
this with gen. installed.  look  in your idiot book index under&quot;polarizing&quot;

=================
im kinda unclear on this. also i have a 64 kombi vin
number 1156209- i think i heard somwhere that the
earlier 64's still had the pull type handles-being
that the 64 was the first year for push button type.
is this the case with me?    tia

it changed during th 64 model year- on Dec 18th at vin 1 222  xxx, so yours 
would have pull handles, and also the elbow type engine lid prop which is 
easily broken when misused (always remove them when you take your bus to be 
inspected), not the spring type which is rarely broken.
============
ps-almost forgot last night while doing a tuneup on my
super i ran across a spark plug that does not want to
come out. i am aware of the dreaded stripping of the
plug so i did not try to turn it. is there somthing i
could do about this? heat up the head? let the engine
run for a long while? please help and again tia
. . .  . . . ..
I have one of these in my bug and I only remove 3 spark plugs when I tune it 
up.  ( I dislike DP motors, they always crap out.) Yes this is kind of lame.  
 It is also easy and cheap. (call me lazy- I use the bug as a back up anyway, 
usually drive the bus, so it doen't get a lot of miles anyway)  If it bothers 
me, I can either get a helicoil,  or   make it more of a bother meaning  take 
out the motor and replace the head.   Make it sweet and SP. Which I will do 
eventually, it being ana ugly DP.     a helicoil is easier and cheaper and 
quicker than that.
