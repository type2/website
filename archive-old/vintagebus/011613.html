&gt;them to listen to him.  Most of you guys are bitching about the answers 
you
&gt;got when YOU asked him a question.
&gt;
Just to set the record straight: I, for one, have received numerous rude 
and insulting replies from Bob Hoover despite the fact that I have NEVER 
ONCE solicited his advice, merely posted questions or appeals for advice 
to the list.  I don't think that I or anyone else deserves to be dumped 
on in this way and I think that the latest Hoover posts regarding 
reposting old messages and letting the list judge who is right are the 
height of egomania.  If Bob feels he needs to dredge up proof of whether 
he was out of line or not for all the world to see, that is the most 
self-important bullsh!t I've ever heard of and a total waste of time and 
bandwidth.  I fail to see why it would be necessary to have the list 
evaluate whether a person's opinion of Bob is valid.  I think that all 
opinions are valid, although I am sure that if Bob had his way, those 
opposing his own would be automatically filtered out of the list.
While I respect that Bob Hoover does possess a great deal of useful 
knowledge and abilities, and has helped me to find the answers to some 
problems, he also tends to be a condescending jerk.  I for one think it 
is way out of line to be essentially told that I am a stupid girl who 
just wants some much more intelligent and able man to rescue me from all 
my bus problems.  That kind of thinking is extremely offensive to me and 
many others and so far from the truth that I can't even begin to 
describe.

PS.  Personally I think copyright laws regulating activities which do 
not cause harm to anybody are b.s. and I would not hesitate to break 
them or to challenge them in court if necessary.
