Subject: Re: [VB] Beetlemex Engine, Broken Cam...

&gt;  I put the original cam, now missing the cam gear, in and using a 
&gt;dial indicator, I noted no jump when hooked up to the pump gear and 
&gt;turned.  It ran smoothly.  The german cam runs smooth until it is 
&gt;mated with the oil pump gear.


you won't notice any 'jump' w/out the cam gear - the camshaft jumps 
when the lash between cam gear and crank gear is off, and the teeth 
bind.
it is hard enough to find 'regular' cam gears with the right pitch 
(the cam gears are stamped -7 to +7, tho + or -1 is more common and 
usually all you need ... NO stamp means 0), i shudder at the scarcity 
of these; ronnie, looks like it is time for your patented 
part-searching skills!
