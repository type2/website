I have a pair of 5 bolt VW drums that i would like to sell.
I wondered if any one can identify them by the part # 113.506.615.D
They are new.

from the first digit of the part number you can tell it is a bg part.

if the nnmber was 113 501 615 D it would be a rear brake drum for a bug

which means for deluxe bugs from nov 57,  all inc standard from some time in
62, through the end of 67, except for the 67 bugs with disc brakes.  wow- they
used the same part a long time.  Those M codes mean different engine sizes
that were available, which was generally tied to brakes size (more go, more
stop) 
.....................
Also I was wondering about the &quot;big nut tranny&quot; axle dimensions.
What is the size of the splined part? is it the same as a small nut 
axle? I measured my axle spline and it is 30 m.m. dia and about 76 m.m. 
long from the bearing to the threads.

bigger spline for big nut that small nut.   bug small nuts with fit bus small
nut rear stb axles.
