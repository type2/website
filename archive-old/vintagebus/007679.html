Subject: [VB] Dodge Caravan was almost a Barndoor

Theoretically then, my wife's Dodge Caravan is as close to being a barndoor
as Thom's '55...that is, they are both piston-driven,fossil-fuel propelled
conveyances designed to move people and cargo from point to point.
My '66 Westy though, wasn't made by Volkswagen, as some list members rather
abruptly and I think self-righteously pointed out in response to another
listees legitimate and I believe well-intentioned question.
As much as I love my VW's, (currently numbering 6), the list on occasion
gets a little wierd...that's free expression though and that's the heart of
the 'net, not banner ads and all this other stuff. Life would be much less
interesting without this exchange.
