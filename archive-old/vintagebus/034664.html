Hi Jason,
Early VWs used 8 shims, and even earlier used three times thicker shims and 
only 6 of them, but having more shims than stock does not hurt as long as the 
pulley nut can easily be tightened to the point that the threaded end of the 
shaft is flush or sticks out a bit from the back (FIF) of the nut.  If in 
doubt take off the fan belt and reassemble the upper pulley with out the 
belt.  If upon lightly tightening the rear half of the pulley still rocks 
around by hand pressure you need more shims!
