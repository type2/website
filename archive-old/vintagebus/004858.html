Hi Ronnie.

My bus underside was/is painted the same color as the rest
of the bus, turquoise. 64 delivery, DD. It also has the full
belly pan. What is under the belly pan, I don't know.

Chris



&gt; does anybody know or has anybody figured out what paint
was used by VW to
&gt; paint or seal the underneath of a commercial bus? On my
single cab it
&gt; appears to be a light gray primer, but most has gone away
over the last
&gt; forty years and surface rust has developed. I would like
to repaint this
&gt; area but don't know what to use?
