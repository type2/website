Hi Folks,

I recently spotted an ad on Craig's List (Bay area) for a stolen 1990 Silver
Westy. I emailed the owner, and she passed on the info.

I know Vanagon &amp; Westy owners are always on the lookout for others, so I
offered to pass this on to the whole community in an effort to help.

I don't know her, but she has provided her email.

Here're the details.

____________________________________________________________________________

Silver 1990 Westfalia, great condition, 125k miles (10K since heads redone),
License # 1VAL007, ski rack on the poptop, VIN#WV2ZB0254LH021189.

Stolen from out in front of 1469 17th Avenue in San Francisco sometime
between 12/20/02 and 12/26/02.

And, again, happy to pay a $1K  reward for its return in decent condition,
no questions asked.

Thanks so much for your help.
