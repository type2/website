&gt; Its not your typical primered and rusted mid
60's standard. Vintage purists be damned - it is one of 24 known in the
world. I am thrilled to have it. =)&lt;

Rusty,

        When are we going to get to see some online pix of it?  I am sure
that guy that does not like trip reports and rescue stories cant complain
about pictures.   Hey, we still havent seen your &quot;before&quot; pix of your E-Z
camper.  BTW, has everyone seen the picture of Rusty's wifey in &quot;Hot
V-dubs&quot;?

        We are an OBJECT oriented world!

        You have some neat stuff going on.....share with us.  Send me some
images and some ideas, I will temporarily host/author whatever cool-groovy 
stuff you have going til you can get off your &quot;used to be lazy&quot; now
&quot;recovering from over vacationing&quot; behind and put together a website.

        How 'bout it RVB?
