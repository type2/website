&gt; Scott, how is the ride with the beam adjusters lowered? Just curious. Does
&gt; it make the front end ride &quot;rougher&quot;? I know you are just putting the
&gt; height to a normal stock setting, but just wondered if it made the ride
&gt; stiffer or anything.

Its actually much nicer.  My daughter noticed it right away after a freeway
trip out to her sister's apt.

Depending upon the fwy, we'd be going along and a nice (how do I portray
this via email) bumping motion set up and if you started verbalizing it
would sound like UH - UH - UH -UH at some constant interval.

First time out on the freeway, I was struck by how relaxed I felt and on the
way back realized that the ride had been much smoother.

I noticed in a recent HVW mag the comment was made about the later beam ride
being rougher, but that is contrary to what I am experiencing.

Scott
