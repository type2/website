One of the big misteaks I see is that so many people primer vehicles and drive them that way (he says as he thinks of that primered patch on his bus). The thing to remember about primer is that it's a base for paint; it is not paint. Primer is porous. It lets water in. Actually, It's good if you've got your vehicle parked in a garage and want to keep the moisture in the air from rusting your bus, but it's not a permanent or long-term solution.

...and whoever came up with this rust-colored primer? ...what were they thinking? I've seen rednecks drive for years, just adding more and more of that stuff on top of the rough rust as it surfaces. I can't tell you how many F*rds that stuff has sent to the grave. ;) Joe
