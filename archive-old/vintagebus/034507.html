Too bad you did'nt make it to the 1st annunal OCTO (NEATO chapter in OC
Cal.).  There was someone there with NOS interior panels.  If I remember
correctly, the guy had some como green ones.   Anybody that went, know
who that was?   The guy was driving a blue hightop bay window bus.

ya- that guy- I don't know his name but met him in Jerome- kinda an older
hippy guy.
