Congrats Clara.

For those who don't know, Clara was a self described
electrical chicken just a year ago or so.  Those of us
who aren't afraid of the electrical demons (tho we may be
of other demons) provided encouragement, advice, and 
prodded (zap) her into diving in.

To read this report of her diggin' in, poking &amp; prodding
into the heart of the electrical demons and coming out
intact, meritorious, and successful provides hope to
us all for us to conquer our vehicular demons.  
(Mine demon is hydraulics).

As for the screw on connectors:

Keep looking in different FLAPS and electrical supply
houses.  I found a momentary push button switch for
use as an in-engine-bay remote start switch that was a 
Euro style switch.  Large diameter install hole, threaded
connections, not push on spade connections.   Look for 
shops that cater to the flashy pop lowrider/cruising Euro look.
Look for Euro style stuff.

I found it at a Pipe &amp; Supply shop that supplies plumbing
and electrical stuff, primarily to contractors. They had it
in a bunch of close-out stuff.

They make a paint on vinyl electrical tape, that one just paints
onto the connection.  No more hassling with tape falling off.
Comes in a can with a brush in the lid, several colors.  Check
hardware stores.  If you can't find the right connector, and if
it's gonna be a permanent connection, solder the wires together, 
then paint on tape.

Clara writ -
I looked for the little connector with two screw bits to connect them 
properly, but only found one :( 

SO if anyone has a few extra, I would love to get some and get rid of 
the electrical tape and do it right.
