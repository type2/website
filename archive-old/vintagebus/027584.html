I know this doesn't exactly answer your question, Rex, but I dredged up an
old post from Dave Easterwood on the subject:

====================================

The &quot;bastard 40hp&quot; engine (Volkswagen called it the &quot;modified 36hp&quot;) was 
closer to a 40hp than a 36hp, but had design flaws.  Most of them were 
replaced by the dealer after only a couple of years of service.  
Nicknamed the &quot;bastard&quot; because it was a quickly orphaned design.

It was used in buses from April 19, 1959 (chassis #469447) until May of 
1960 (chassis #614456).

Notable differences from the later 40hp design are:
 
*a larger front main seal
*no dowel pins in main bearings (they were split bearings held in place by 
 tangs - like cam bearings)
*the thrust main bearing was not the #1 bearing at the flywheel, but the 
 next one back
*the heads have a seperate chamber under the intake
*the upper cylinder tin has a hump where the cylinder numbers are stamped

They really have only collector value now, as they are not rebuildable, 
since the bearings &amp; seals have not been available since the '60s.
