Subject: Bryon and BBB4 insurance

 I had the same thought on Bryon and his bus and I did ask him about
insurance and he said he was covered  as he had only had the bus 4 days and
his insurance is automaticly in effect for 2 weeks. I have Farmers and I do
remember asking  them about insurance when bringing a used bus home from
Phoenix  one time and they said I was covered for a short time also, Like
when you buy a new/used car/bus out of town on a Sun. and drive it home.
Maybe this only applies to bringing the car/bus back to your house and not
out of the way trips. I am going to ask my agent again to be sure on this
though. Is anyone on the list an insurance agent and can clear this up? For
the BBB4 event we get our insurance from NEATO through J.C. Taylor and it is
for millions due to all the liability problems that can come up. The city
parks and rec. dept (who we get the stage from) and the campground require
us to have this. Wonder how many VW  shows/ events happen without any
insurance? I would bet over 50% don't have or even think about it. In that
case the event club/promoters would be liable and a sharp lawyer would have
a field day. Large or small get insurance for your VW event. At least bryon
did drive his bus and I don't think it was as unsafe as Ronnie makes it out
to be. It is a total rust free 58 DD panel with very minor dents and
converted to a camper in 1958. Makes it one of the earliest non westy
campers around. It is red and you can see it in a couple of the event
pictures. I do agree with Thom though about the need to get your buses
insured and have coverage on all my buses also. I've only meet Bryon at 2
bus events and he is a guy who has dreamed of getting a bus and maybe he did
jump the gun a little on this one, but it all worked out ok in the end. Lets
here from a listy insurance agent.

See you all at Buses by the Bridge V Jan. 19,20,21 2001

 I will finally get to go to the Kelly Park vintage show this year and hope
to see alot of these great nor cal buses there.

John Howard, on location at home today ( too tired after the show and need
to rest up and use a vacation day )
