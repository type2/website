Subject: pelican 356 hub part no and prices

I dont know if they are the cheapest but for ref.

hub 547-09-304  15.75
inner half 539-09-315  12.35
outer half 539-09-316  14.45

leaving off the woodruff key thats 42.55 a whole hell of a lot cheaper
than the 65.00 &quot;deal&quot; on ebay

youll want the nut and shims too, trust me.

nut 547-09-303  31.70   (yes its expensive, you _could_ use your old one
but its worth it imho)

shims 539-09-314 1.50 each and you probably want 10 so 15.00 (they are
nicer than the vw shims)

grande total
89.25. its gone up quite a bit since i last bought them.

here is the pelican link
