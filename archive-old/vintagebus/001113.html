Subject: Re: [VB] roof rack straightening?

If they are buckled to the point of taking the round out of them (as in a
tubing style rack ) then you'll probably have to replace. If just tweaked a
bit any metal fabbing shop or welding shop, worth a chit, should be able to
fix. Some of the channel formed racks would have to be worked to straighten,
a bit tougher to do. good luck,,later
