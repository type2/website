Subject: Slat fasteners and Octo


&gt;&gt;&gt;Dan asked: Were the wooden bed slats for VW trucks originally screwed in
or riveted?  Couldn't find it in the archives.

Early years were screwed down with a cheese head style, standard drive sheet
metal screw.  Later models (&gt;63 possibly) they switched to rivets.  I paid
attention to the motoguzzi truck at the octo meet and then asked charlie
hamill about it as well.  I'm of course most interested in what's right for
a 59.  Charlie was good enough to loan me an original screw. :-)... then
Greg Noble hounded me on the way to the airport that I needed to find OG bed
slat screws or I could never show up to any octo meet with the dc.... so,
I'm looking for a pile of these :-0

...  I'll post up to the list when I find a match in mcmaster carr or where
ever regarding what is correct for the early screws.

By the way, Clara, you were right, when ever I would approach someone's swap
space and root through there stuff for screws, people would *accuse* me:
'you must be Dave'... sheesh

... And one more thing.  Robert D's westy is better in person than any
picture you could ever imagine.  A vehicle to aspire to!
