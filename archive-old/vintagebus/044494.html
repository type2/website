Subject: EVENTS LIST - Anyone interested in taking it over?
To: undisclosed-recipients:;

Hi there,

Well - I am getting to the point where I no longer have time to work on the 
VW Events Listing - at least not able to get updates added within 48 hours.

Is there anyone interested in taking it over?  If so - e-mail me and I will 
send you the components - HTML and all.

Thanks Much
