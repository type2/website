&lt;&lt; If you own a original westy tow hitch or have any
 first hand knowledge of them can you please email me.
 (direct)  I am gathering info on the differences
 between the years.  I know of 3 distinctly different
 versions thru the years right now and want to compile
 any others.
 
 So far i know there is:
 1.  A Barn Door version that was adapted for a press
 bumper and a round tube trany cradle.  Built around
 1961.
 
 2.  A post BS version with the main torsion bar
 runners very wide (about 30&quot;) and having no connecting
 structure between them.  Built in the mid 60's
 probably from 1962-1966.
 
 3.  Most common version which looks the same as #2 but
 the torsion bar mounts are closer together (about 10&quot;)
 and there is a cross piece between the 2.  Built from
 1967 thru at least 1975.
  &gt;&gt;

You've seen the post BS version- but have you seen the BS version?  I heard 
they didn't work worth a d%^m
