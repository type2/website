Well I about rear ended 10+ cars yesterday.  My brakes
went out in the 
morning came back that afternoon and then were
completely gone today.  
Gonna attempt to bleed the system tonight, but what
gives.  They were working great the other day.
It's getting more fun every day.

If I remember from an earlier post, you have an early
67 bus. You probably have the single circuit master
cylinder. I have the same setup on my 67 ( #559) and I
replaced the master cylinder shortly after I bought it
4 years ago. Dont take any chances with the early
setup...Also, you might consider converting to the
late style duel setup. I'm sure I will convert mine
one of these days.
Check all of your wheel cylinders for leaks, could be
your problem.
