so I go to drive the westy today, and turn the key, and...nada.  No lights, no
click, no nothing.    Turn on headlight- nada.  Turn on overhead light- nada.

??

Go to engine compartment- turn on light in there- also nada.   that is direct
to the battery.  get a 13mm wrench and my 12V drop light- put the drop light
on the battery and it works,   test the volatage- when i put the hot terminal
on the battery strap it reads 0, when I put it on the top of the battery +
terminal, it reads 12.28Volts.   So I take off the + connnection,  (as I do so
the engine compartment light comes on from wiggling when turning the wrench)
clean it and replace it, and it suddenly has juice.

How does this relate to my recent starter problems?   Good question.  I did
bench test the starter when I removed it- it was dead.   Wierd.   ( I used a
battery chager and part of a tarns bell housing to support it.  Had a new
starter bushing with the new tranny, though I had not replace the bushing when
I put the starter in 2 years ago- as it is a pain when the engine is
installed.   So I had probably driven it 2  years (or really 1 1/2 years as it
sat the last 6 months) with an old and possibly worn bushing.    Coincidence?
related?    I missed something somewhere.    Does getting partial juice harm a
starter?

I was thinking of JoeFournier who had asked me if I had cleaned my  battery
grounds after I posted about the starter dying.  Pretty close- it was just the
other terminal/battery connection.   Hadn't cleaned that since I put the
battery in about 2 1/2 years ago.  Things corrode, particularly in a damp
climate.   Maybe I should put that on the do every  year  list.   Cleaning the
battery terminal a few years ago doesn't count.    Thanks, Joe.

So yous alls- clean your connections, particularly if you have 6V buses.
FWIW, the 54  I used to have had really bright lights- you could see the
semaphore light up in the daytime.   I was asked if it was 12V, because of the
brightness, but no it was 6V and my ex had cleaned -all- the connections.
