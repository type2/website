Just stopped by yesterday to see if they had a dome light switch for my truck. While they didn’t have that, I did check out your panel Woody.  The underside looks as good as the top.  They had it up on a lift.  Looked like the beam was going in.  Very nice.

Alex (I think) was color sanding the '54 BD's front door.  He told me that the bus sold for a second time (51K I think) to  a new private collector.  The first sale fell through after the museum it was going to found a '51.  

Vintage VW's all over that place.
