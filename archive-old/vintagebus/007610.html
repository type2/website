Hi,

Just got back from a business trip to Phoenix. Finished
business early so I decided to look up junk yards. Found
All German and went over for a look. It was almost closing
time but got a quick look at a split out back. The front was
already cut off so I didn't get my coveted passenger door
pillar. But, the front end and back end suspensions are
still there as well as a lot of other parts.  Go Get Em.

Anyone in AZ with a passenger door pillar?  Need the piece
between the two hinges as well as the front face out to the
V.  Pmail me if you have something in good condition and
that you can part with,  that can be just welded in without
further repairs. I will pmail back a photo of what I am
looking for.

Thanks.
Chris
