Hey guys and gals! My newly aquired DC (63) has had the division between the

seats hacked out of it. How would I go about finding the mcodes on this

truck? Also where would they be on a 55 SC(if it has them)? Thanks alot!

sorry, each tag is unique, you are SOL

the tags were first used at ch # 398 xxx,  a few years after 55.

you could write and send 10DM to the museum in germany who keeps records, 
they have some of this stff in their file.
