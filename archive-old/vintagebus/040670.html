Importance: Normal

Contemplating the relative merits of splittie vs. bay window and I have a
few questions to ask of the other esteemed list members. This is NOT a
debate of which is the better bus.

1.) The Bay windows do not have spur reduction gears correct? How does this
translate into real world drivability? Does it mean a higher top end at the
expense of low-end torque which would adversely affect any (gentle) off-road
use in addition to less slogging-ability through snow here in Wisconsin.

2.) The heat and driver controls are better in the Bay windows correct? But
they lack the overhead vent. Generally though, the Bay window should be a
warmer vehicle for cold weather cruising?

3.) The driving position in the splitties are more forward with less of a
dash and a flatter steering wheel therefore more bus-like which appeals to
me immensely. The Microbus--Volkswagen would do good to go back to that
original idea.
