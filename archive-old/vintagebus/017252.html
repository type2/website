Those estimates sound in the ball park to me. 
Fourteen years ago it cost me $1000 or a bit more to
have my double cab primed and painted, with a little
body work done first.  (My F_at_rd truck had been in an
accident and the double cab paint is where the
insurance money went.)
This many years later the prices you mention don't
seem too bad.  Have you seen work that the body shop
has done?  I decided on the shop that I used because
they were mentioned when I stopped and asked people
who had nicely painted cars, who had done the work on
their car.  After 3 or 4 people with nicely done VWs
and other older cars gave me the name of the same
shop, I decided to have them do the work.
