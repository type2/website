Subject: Re: [VB] Head stud pulling out of case...options?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I would say might be best to dump that case and get
another in better shape or a new case (best idea)...I
have been building vw engines for 15 years
now...probabaly done hundreds of them.  

Seen lots of pulled studs and tried to fix them (at
the owners instructions) When you start to get a
pulled stud..._dot_ususally more will follow...the cause
seems to me that something has occured with the
case... severe overheating of the engine at one time
or another I have found to be the prominent cause. 
Seems with the overheating the case almost becomes
britlle...and yes I have seen people use case savers
and this will sometimes cure the problem but not
always!  I have seen the case savers just come right
out too...this is all just a band aid on the
underlying problem.  Remeber VW did not use case
savers up until very recently. I have rebuilt numerous
old nasty 25hp and 36hp engines with tons of miles on
them with no pulled studs.  Yes the case savers will
help out if done 'before' the case has the
probelms...but after the problem seems to arise I have
found a safe guard is to start fresh with another case
new or good used without the problem.
