&gt; Ok, bus content now.  For the past two days I have been cutting away rusty 
&gt; parts of my bus.  &quot;So what does that leave me with?&quot;  I ask sometimes.  When 
&gt; I bought my bus, the rockers on both sides were toast.  Fortunately, some 
&gt; donor rocker panels cut from an otherwise straight burned out '67 kombi were 
&gt; included by the PO.  The story of that particular bus is a sad one, but I 
&gt; won't get into that right now.  I have left the entire rocker assembly 
&gt; together, i.e. outer skin, and inner rocker so that I can weld the whole 
&gt; thing on.  No sense dissassembling it and then piecing it back together on 
&gt; the bus says I.  Anyway, the donor rockers are in pretty good shape, but 
&gt; surface rust is beginning on the inside.  Since I don't want to do this 
&gt; again in 5 years when the donor rockers rust through, I have been trying to 
&gt; figure out the best way to de-rust, and then rustproof these sections.  My 
&gt; ideas are as follows:
&gt; 
&gt; -take both rocker assembly pieces to get acid dipped, and then galvanized.  
&gt; Would the galvanization make it harder to weld them back on?  I'll be using 
&gt; a standard 110 lincoln gasless mig, if that means anything.
&gt; 
&gt; -have both rocker assemblies sandblasted, and then try to get POR15 into all 
&gt; the inside rust hiding places.
&gt; 
&gt; I like the acid wash/galvanized idea, but I have no experience with this 
&gt; process.  Would it work the way I'm hoping it would?  The main reason I like 
&gt; it is because it involves dipping the rockers, and that way the liquid can 
&gt; get everywhere (theoretically) and make these rockers last awhile.  Any 
&gt; reason why I shouldn't pursue this idea?
&gt; 

I agree with kelly that galvanizing isnt the way to go. How about
derusting and coating with something weldthru-able? Perhaps Picklex
(formerly rass-o-nil)?

I dont think youll be welding through por very easily so maybe its not
such a good pre-treatment.
