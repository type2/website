Okay list!!!  Pete is tops.

A million thanks Pete for putting me onto that heater and actually inquiring 
after it at the yard.  I picked it up this morning and with the engine out 
it went very smoothly.  The heater, from what I can tell from my incomplete 
readings, is complete thxs to your fyi on where the switch had been tucked 
away.  I was able to extract everything including ducting, control cables 
and the various pipes which are in good condition.  I will have a hard time 
not fiddling with it immediately but I want to go over all the material I 
have been downloading and stashing before I set my tools loose.  So.. I 
dusted it, cooed over it and will get into it this weekend a little more.
