Subject: running

The County has finally come down on me: they want my bus repaired or 
moved. And, I am still unable to get it running. This week, I replaced 
the fuel line and made the modification suggested by Bob Hoover. It was 
no wonder the previous owner couldn't get it started. There is no way 
fuel would have made it down the line. The fuel line coming out of the 
tank was held on by threads!!

But that is not the only problem, I am losing voltage too. The starter 
seems fine. I will continue to work on that problem this weekend.

On a good note. I ran into a fellow splitty owner yesterday. He is not on 
the list but is a super guy. His name is Brandt Bell. We talked for quite 
a while and then later he came over to look at my bus. He told me he had 
a spare windshield he would give to me. Since I have been in business for 
twenty years, I am used to people not keeping their promises. I expected 
he would forget about it, but this morning I found the windshield on the 
front seat of my pickup truck!! He restored some of my lost faith in 
humanity.
