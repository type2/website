Subject: 40hp Head Question
Date: Sat, 14 Apr 2001 22:53:59 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I have a cylinder head, which I believe is for a 40hp.  The number on it is
113 101 371C.  I was going to give it to someone who needs a replacement
head for his 40hp, but he said his old head has the number 113 101 373.  If
someone with a parts list could tell me exactly what these are, and if
they're interchangeable, I'd really appreciate it.

Thanks,
