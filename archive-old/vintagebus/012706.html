Well actually the shoes get a glass glaze over them and not the drums.
  Though the Comet will probably do the job of removing the glaze off of the
  shoes. We are a little worried that this would increase rust since the
  chlorine part of Comet is simular to what is in Sodium Chloride (Common
  salt!). Is there a chemist in the list that can tell us!
