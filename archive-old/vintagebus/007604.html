&gt; I have never really payed attention to powder coating before. But I got a
&gt; question, what about brake fluid, will it eat it away like it does paint?

Nope - like Thom said, nothing short of a nuclear explosion will take it
off.  Of course if you are into the poor driving habits of curb scraping,
I'm sure you would do more than take a little powercoating off of the rim.
Most lawnmower decks are powdercoated and you know how tough they are.  They
last for years under harsh conditions.

It costs me about $125 to $150 to have a whole set of 5 rims sandblasted and
powdercoated.  My rims on m Li'l Red were done 3 to 4 years ago and when I
hose them off, they look just as glossy black as the day I brought them
home.
