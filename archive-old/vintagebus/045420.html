&lt;&lt; I have noticed a lot of you guys and gals prefer the single port motors as 
opposed to the dual port. Is there a reason why? &gt;&gt;
Hi Chad,
Due to several reasons.

1.  Stock DP heads all too often crack due to too thin of casting around the 
sparkplug hole and valve seats.  If you do run stock German DP heads make 
sure to not just shut it down during hot days right from running at higher 
RPMs.  Instead sit and let it idle for a couple of minutes to let the heads 
shed the heat and prevent unequal cooling when shut down which distorts the 
head and cracks it.   To remidy this you have to buy the Brazilian 
aftermarket CB 041 heads which use a longer special sparkplug. 

2.  With the single manifold there are only three seal to go bad.  With the 
dual port manifold there are two more rubber seals to go bad.  Which causes 
that head on that side of the manifold to lean out and burn a valve/s.

3.  The DP aluminum end castings can distort or corrode alot easier than do 
the steel single port manifold ends.

4.  With single port manifold one can install and remove #3 &amp; #1 sparkplugs 
with ease.  Dual port manifold blocks this easy access unless it is in a Baja 
or KG.
