I have a lead on two RHD 1956 ambulances.
Brief description follows.  I think around $5-6k US
would get you both and shipping would run
around US$2k per vehicle (that's what
I paid a couple of years ago anyway).

The word is out and I don't think they'll
last long.  May be able to negotiate on
one of the pair.
