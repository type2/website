Subject: westy curtain questions

Hi,
   I am ready to have some curtains sewn for my '67 but have a few questions 
maybe some of you can help me with.

1) Did '67 westys have 2 curtain rods on each window or a rod on top and a 
spring on the bottom?  I have rods for the top of each window and didn't 
know if I should bother to find more.

2) Where should the top rod be mounted on each window relative to the metal 
frame that surrounds the window from the inside?  I checked out all the 
westy pictures I could find and there seems to be a little bit of variance.

3) What are the dimensions of each curtain half? Some of the ones pictured 
seemed pretty long.

My bus is not exactly what you would call &quot;stock&quot; but I guess I might as 
well get it close whenever possible.

thanks for your help,
Wayne Carlisle
'67 camper
