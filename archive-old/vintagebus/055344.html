&gt;  In addition to the piss hole on most connecting rods, isnt the
splashing of the crankshaft the method used to lubricate the cylinder
walls?  Doesnt seem that the dry sump thing would be the way to go on a
daily driver.  Or maybe I am mistaken?

Cylinder wall lubrication by oil splash is a very crude system that has
largely been relegated to industrial engines.  Most autos have cylinder
lubrication through squirter holes on the con rods.
