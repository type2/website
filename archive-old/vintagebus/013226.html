&gt; While at the VW Classic this weekend, we noticed quite a few Type 2's with a 
&gt; shifter extention.  It was kind of a bent tube that brought the shifter 
&gt; closer to you so that you dont need to lean forward to shift.

THere was one on ebay that went for $60-something.  I paid $5 for mine,
including the knob!

Just gotta keep an eye out at the swaps and on ebay I guess...
