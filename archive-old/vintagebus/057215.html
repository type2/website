Subject: Re: [VB] Check out this custom bus!!!

Hey Scott,
I didn't have time to ask the owner many questions
about it. I have no specks on the engine. My guess
would be a good usable  1600 beetle engine. I can't
say. The interior was a let down. It had 2 raged out
dune buggie racing seats in the front. The dash was
present but not repainted. It had its origional white
paint which was yellowed and speckled with surface
rust. The top of the doors were left open. There was a
rug on the floor in the back. No back seats. My guess
is that this was used mainly for a bill board that had
the capibility of moving on its own. It was probably
driven on the ocassional sunnyday or durring parrades
and things. Yes, this was located in Jacksonville, NC
at a small motorcycle/dirt bike/ scooter shop. If
nothing else, it makes a very effective advertisement
in its retirement.

Have a great day!

David Kelly

&gt; Hurray!  finally.
&gt; You know I *almost* found it on my own.  When I was
&gt; doing a search, I used kelly
&gt; by itself and got the picture of the dog.  Woops, no
&gt; bus here, oh well.  Next
&gt; time I guess I'll dig a little deeper.
&gt; 
&gt; Now on to the bus,
&gt; Can you provide any info on it?
&gt; Did they keep the engine stock?
&gt; What's the interior like?
&gt; Looks like they removed the windows, did they finish
&gt; the tops of the doors or
&gt; leave them open?
&gt; BTW, Its kind of fun driving the bus without the
&gt; windows in place.  I did that
&gt; for a while when I got my DC back on the road for
&gt; the first time.  My daughter
&gt; and I were coming home one saturday and her long
&gt; blonde hair was flying out the
&gt; bus, we had a good laugh as people drove by pointing
&gt; and joining us in the
&gt; laughter.
&gt; I'm guessing this thing is located in Jacksonville
&gt; NC?
