Yeah, I kind of wish I kept that old carb. It did give me better mileage
than the one I replaced it with. At the time I didn't know any better, and
went with the recommendation of the engine builder. The engine ended up not
lasting too long anyway. I think it was related to a clogged oil filter, but
I'm not sure....

Small carburators are ususally great for mileage.  The only difference you
will see is in top end performance, since the small hole won't flow as
much air as a large hole.  As long as the carb is jetted right you won't
have any heating problems.
