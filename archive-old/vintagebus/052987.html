&gt;No, that's fine.  What's weird is a LOT of people get me confused!  I've=

had people walk up to me and my bus at shows and say &quot;Hi Everett!&quot;
&gt;
&gt;I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing...
&gt;
Let's go with &quot;good&quot;. 

No one has ever called me &quot;Thom&quot; although they did email me when your sit=
e
was down last week.  You'll be recieving my support fees per our contract=

later...
