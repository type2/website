Subject: Re: [VB] Electric vs Mechanicle?

    Are we talking about an alternator or a generator here? If its
generator, then worn brushes being short, are not held tight by the springs
against the armature. This causes an &quot;arc&quot; at the brush contact point. And
this will burn pits in the armature rather quickly. The armature will need
to be checked on a &quot;growler&quot;, and if it passes this and the &quot;size spec's&quot; it
should be &quot;turned&quot; and the &quot;mica&quot; under cut before the brushes are replaced.
    If an alternator, then you will have a hard time finding someone to turn
the commutator. If the brush contact surface is smooth, clean it up with
some fine emery paper ( 600  grit ), and replace the internal voltage
regulator/brush holder and you should be ok.

&gt; Well, that was 1991, and the bus charged just fine for about a year until
I sold it.
&gt; I seem to rember the commutator looking fine, but it was a while ago.
