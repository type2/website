&gt;I noticed a reference to the Peach State Transporter Rally?  If anyone 
&gt;has more info on this like where and when and do they have a website, 
&gt;please let me know.

Sally,

Peach State Transporters is the Georgia chapter of NEATO.  We hold several 
events during the year, the next of which is our Dead of Winter campout and 
will be February 6-7, 1999.

The Dead of Winter campout is usually held at Cloudland Canyon State Park in 
the NW corner of Georgia.  Last year we had to move the campout to &quot;Sloppy&quot; 
Floyd State Park, a little south and lower elevation due to 6-8&quot; of snow and 
park rangers who didn't want to clear roads at Cloudland Canyon.

We also have a Spring Campout that rotates locations, a big Vintage VW show 
in the summer (last year over 100 VWs), and a Fall Campout every year at 
Duckett Mill on Lake Lanier.

We are a pretty active group and in addition to our regular events we have 
a few &quot;unofficial&quot; campouts and we caravan to other events in the southeast 
including Buses on the Blue Ridge and the Bulli Brigade &amp; Bug Jam in Tampa.

I do have a web page with photos of past events, but to be honest I can't 
remember the last time I updated it!  After I get the next issue of Old Bus 
Review in the mail I'll scan some photos &amp; update the PST page.  You can find 
it at:

Georgia has the weirdest weather...  today it is in the 70's and in 2 days 
the high won't get out of the 30's.

Get out there &amp; enjoy your buses!

Dave
