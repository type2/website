It's been interesting coming back after a weekend away and seeing a few
posts about people taking their Buses for their first *real* drives.  :)  I
had to share as well...

I've had my '63 Camper since December and it's my daily driver (even though
my daily drive to school/work is 6mi round trip), but I've never taken it
on a long road trip or camping trip.  That was, until the Split Bus Club's
Collins Lake campout this past weekend.  San Jose to Collins Lake and
back...376 miles round trip averaging 55-60mph the whole way and 22mpg.  I
was pretty damn impressed with the whole thing!  Of course, the drive back
had to be plagued with heavy rain and wind from Sacramento to Pleasanton,
but heck...I'm home and in one piece!

I planned this weekend as a bit of a shakedown test for Bug-O-Rama and The
Classic Weekend this year and it's been helpful--teaching me other items I
either need to bring or fix in the following trips:
- 6V test light (easy enough)
- Feeler gauge (duh)
- Replace the air vent seals (wow, even in the rain and wind, didn't see
that coming!)
- Carefully rooftar the front window seals (water's *still* getting in)

All in all, a great trip and a great weekend!  
-Taylor
