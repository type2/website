Subject: re: Engine Sutter

Chuck, list,

 I had the same symptom after running my '65 dlx in a 
Mardi Gras parade. A couple miles of stop, slow, stop, 
slow. Bus ran crappy until it got an &quot;Italian Tuneup&quot;, 
high revs and WOT running. I suspect carbon forming on 
the spark plugs, but have no proof. Mixture too rich on 
the idle circuit would be my best guess.
