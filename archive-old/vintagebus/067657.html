Subject: Re: [VB] Wasserboxer conversion versus aftermarket type 1
  aluminum case versus type 4

George Lyle ,Of course, one might question the desire to build an
wasserboxer-case type
1 when the type 4 engine is available in similar stock displacements.
------------- Clip -----------------------
I'm not offering this as any argument but it seems the Type IV blocks are
considered bullet proof by many, whereas the Waser Boxer blocks seem to
all require align boring. Possibly because they run at higher RPMs than
the air cooled counterparts.
I've torn down many type IV engines and I find them to be good blocks
with standard bore cases 90% of the time.
