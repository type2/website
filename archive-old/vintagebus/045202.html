&lt;&lt; I bought the spacer kit from Wolfgang Int'l and their directions don't 
mention cutting the push rod... they do tell you how to adjust it but it 
implies I can still use the one I have.  What's the scoop?&gt;&gt;
Yes, you can use the stock one with that spacer.  How much is the spacer 
going for now?  Last we heard it was $50.00!
 
&lt;&lt;* Should the spacer sit flush against the M/C flange?  The spacer is 
basically a huge aluminum washer, but the ID is not the same all the way 
through...it steps down and gets narrower on one end.  I can get it pretty 
close to flush on the M/C, but the &quot;nose&quot; of the M/C hangs up on the narrower 
ID of the spacer before the spacer is flush.  Will this fix itself as I cinch 
it down during installation or is this a problem?  (I have the recommended 
71+ master cylinder, 211 611 021 AA, German ATE.)&gt;&gt;
That is not good!  You will have to have this ID machined properly or hand 
machine it!
 
&lt;&lt;* Can I slit the brake line grommets to get them around the steel tubes?  I 
got the tubes in a kit with fittings already on the end so I don't think I 
can slide them over the tubes.&gt;&gt;
Yes, you can the originals were cut on one side to allow installation in 
areas where the tubing was solid or hooked up already.   Eric&amp;Barb
