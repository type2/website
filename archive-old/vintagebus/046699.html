Hi Dave,
We are looking into making a base to slip in where the ash tray is in the 
dash.  With the gauges mounted on this base they would be easily visable to 
both driver, and passenger/s in the front seat/s.  Then using a trailer plug 
under the dash the whole setup can quickly be disconnected, removed, and the 
ash tray reinstalled for show time!  Much better than the overhead placement. 
 Try driving in heavy traffic, and glance up to the areas you are pondering 
to see how it just works not as well!  Eric&amp;Barb
