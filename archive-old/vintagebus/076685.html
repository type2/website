Subject: Re: [VB] RE: 6V battery questions

Just guessing...
1. Bug battery is inside the car away from heat/cold extremes.
2. Also under the seat. Anybody remember big people in the back seat shorting out the battery?
3. Buses used differently, more stops and starts, less likely to be garaged.

&gt; Why would they sell a smaller motor for a bug?   same motor, eh? so if it 
&gt; wont turn a 40hp round in a bus it won't in a bug.
