Hi Al,
We doubt that the intake manifold could be that badly bent just due to a 
badly flycut engine.  Do check for vaccum leaks, but make sure the check the 
whole length of the  manifold and if no leak found remove it and run a water 
test to make sure the heat riser tubes are not rusted through to the intake 
tube.
