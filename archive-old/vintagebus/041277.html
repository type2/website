&gt; 
&gt; Look at it from the other side.   While people with &quot;projects&quot; in the
&gt; driveway may think they're beautiful, the rest of the neighbors call
&gt; a spade a spade: it's a non-running, rusting hulk.  I don't care if it's
&gt; a '96 taurus or a '41 schwimmwagen.  If it's sitting in the driveway rusting,
&gt; with pieces missing, and doesn't run, it's *junk*, irrespective of it's
&gt; potential as a classic.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm a project car kind of guy, yet I would still object to some POS 
&gt; dismembered in a neighbors driveway.   You could drive right past my house
&gt; and not know I had a project going on unless I had the garage door open at
&gt; that exact moment.
&gt; 
&gt; And where is it stated that people have a &quot;right&quot; to a junk vehicle?

I would argue in the Constitution..... The idea that others have the right
to tell me what I can/can't do on/to my own property is possibly the most
repulsive societal norm that has come about in the last century. 

&gt; People do not realize that having a project car comes with a responsibilty
&gt; to keep things somewhat neat.  The basic rule of thumb is to keep
&gt; your house no worse than your neighbors.  If all of your neighbors have
&gt; junk cars on the lawn, then you can too.  If they don't, you shouldn't.
&gt; If you do not like conforming to the de facto standard of the rest of the
&gt; neighborhood - MOVE.  Find a neighborhood where everyone has their cars on
&gt; blocks and feel at home.  Or rent a shop in an industrial area,
&gt; where you can rip stuff apart any time of day or night and nobody will
&gt; give a damn.  Go in on the rent with some buddies, and you can have a grand 
&gt; old time.

Or don't move, and get the laws changed. Fight for your essential
freedoms, and don't let others dictate your property rights. It is your
property, fight to regain control of it. Petitioning is a good start, as
is fighting against zoning law in any form. Also look to your local
libertarian party/libertarian oriented politicians for help getting rid of
these oppressive laws.
