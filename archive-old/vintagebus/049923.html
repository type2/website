&gt;Nobody is talking about a lesser known quality of stainless steel
&gt;fasteners. They aren't nearly as strong as standard automotive steel
&gt;fasteners. I'm going to summarize a discussion on just this topic, recently
&gt;seen on another list:
&gt;
&gt;A word of caution about stainless: It is not nearly as strong as common
&gt;steel fasteners, especially if the threads are cut instead of rolled. Most
&gt;stainless bolts are about equivalent to a standard steel grade 2 bolt, and
&gt;most standard steel fasteners used in the automotive industry are grades 5
&gt;to 8.
&gt;
&gt;You can buy specially prepared stainless bolts that are stronger, but they
&gt;are not widely available and are very expensive. Look to the suppliers of
&gt;the airline and the nuclear industries for the exotic and strong stainless
&gt;fasteners. The marine industry also likes them.
&gt;
&gt;So, be warned, and be thoughtful about where you put the stainless
&gt;replacement. It will probably not corrode, but it may break. If the job
&gt;requires strength, perhaps you should consider a coated  standard steel
&gt;fastener. And broken stainless fasteners are very hard to remove because
&gt;they work harden as they are drilled. Use the highest grade of drill when
&gt;working on them.


I was looking at one of the online stainless fastener sources recommended
earlier in this thread, and I noticed that the fasteners seemed to come in
two or three different quality grades.  Can anyone tell me which is the
stronger grade, and if it approximates the '8.8' grade I've seen to often
on the Kamax and other fasteners which are OEM on VWs?

TIA,

Kabayo
