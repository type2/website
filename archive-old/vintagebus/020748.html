&gt; Subject: [T2] Guy broken down
&gt;
&gt; There is a guy broken down between Erie, PA and Jamestown, NY on Route 
&gt; 17
&gt; with a broken axle.  He contacted me via AIRS info, but he is about 4 
&gt; hours
&gt; west of me.  Anyone that can send me some info immediately re. someone 
&gt; to
&gt; help him get off the highway would be appreciated.  I have his cell 
&gt; numbers
&gt; and hopefully someone can help him and his new bride out.
