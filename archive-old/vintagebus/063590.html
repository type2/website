&gt; I have asked about oil temps before and have gotten so many different

&gt; ranging from &quot;oil temp should be AT LEAST 210*..&quot; to &quot;best range is 
&gt; 180-200*..&quot;

Hi John,
If 210F was the minimum then why did VW have the thermostat open the flaps at 
160F and as far as we have seen they never made a 210F thermostat???  Due to 
this we tend to have less than 180F oil temp for most of the fall, winter, 
and most of spring up here in the PNW.  We used to drive our engine well over 
220F oil temp especially duering the summer long trips and engine longevity 
was about 40,000 miles.  Since keeping oil temp below 220F engine longevity 
jumped up to 80,000 miles and the first one was only rebuilt at that point 
due to too much endplay!
