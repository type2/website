Subject: steering box seal
Date: Wed, 05 Apr 2000 23:31:54 PDT
Mime-Version: 1.0

Does anybody know where to get steering box seals? I took it apart and it is 
simple, but I will need a new output shaft seal after it is powdercoated. 
Isn't there supposed to be a seal between the box halves, mine doesn't have 
one. Should I use curel and call it good? The insides look really nice, but 
I need to improve the look of the outside.
