&gt; Hi list,
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone (E+B perhaps) have any pre and post Type IV oil cooler
&gt; conversion oil temp figures. I will be hauling out my motor soon for a
&gt; service, torque up and tin painting party. While I am about it I'd like to
&gt; do the cooler conversion if it makes a significant difference to the temps.
Hi all,

I have been thinking of this but got a better idea from a guy named
hoover... in RAMVA.

a T3 oil cooler.  It requires less tin modification (just cut a slot for
the oil pressure sender boss) and has more cooling per square inch than
the t1 cooler, but its the same size...

Some even say it cools better than the t4 cooler.

peas,

Steve
