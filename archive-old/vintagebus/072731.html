Subject: Re: [VB] Road music or not

 I would hate to have to listen to only one artist, one genre or drive
only one marque of vehicle for the rest of my life.

That pretty much explains the presense all our new Mexican immigrants 
................. how'd you like to look forward to all the Mexican music
and no Old Time Rock and Roll, no Sarah Brightman, no Celene, no Bette
Middler, no John Coltrain no Beatles, just all those guys trying to drown
out that concertina.
