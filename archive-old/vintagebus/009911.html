Funny thing about those idle cutoff solenoids.  In over 22 years of driving
1600 powered buses I've never had one come loose on an original Solex
carburetor.

On the other hand, in less than 12,000 miles the idle cutoff solenoid on the
Brazilian &quot;Solex&quot; replacement carb I'm currently running has come loose 3
times.  And that doesn't include it being very loose right out of the sealed
factory box.

&gt;&gt;  ...Perplexed, I put it back together, and put it on the engine...and
noticed the idle cutoff was a little jiggly.

Wait...a LOT jiggly.  Like, it's-about-to-come-out jiggly!  You can't really
see it when it's on the car.  I traced in my mind the results of it coming
out...gas on the distributor cap.  Fuel lines go up.  Fuel lines lead to the
gas tank, with all that lovely 87 octane sloshing around.  Bye-bye bus.  I
tightened it several turns(!), snugged it, and fired it up.  Idled a great
deal smoother, imagine that!  Seemed to idle really high once it got going.
Gee.  ;-)  &lt;&lt;
