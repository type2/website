&gt;So if the slats are hardwood which makes perfect sense and standard from

&gt;on the availability of Oak in Germany as opposed to some other types of
&gt;Hardwoods.  Not trying to be difficult just curious.  Any German listees
&gt;have thoughts on Hardwoods there?
&gt;If I pick up the SC here in town I will proceed on the use of Oak but if
&gt;anyone has other thoughts post it up.  Thanks again!


dunno if you noticed on my site, but the parts manual claims that as of
April 30th 1957 VIN# 249 220, VW used a material called &quot;hardwood&quot; and then
used this &quot;hardwood&quot; until VIN#252 834 which is barely even the first half
of May! So they used Oak for 2 weeks then switched back to some other junk
wood? Still a mystery, but most people claim that all trucks had Oak. Randy
can make you slats out of most anything (mahogany, maple etc) but Oak seems
to be the common choice. I was plannin on nailing Charlie hammil with a
stack of truck questions, but got side tracked and im sure he woulda been
more interested in the beer in his hand then my petty vintage nazi questions
=)
