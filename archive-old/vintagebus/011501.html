If I remember right, use plenty of penetrating fluid if the screws securing
the door to the shaft are rusted.  They also require a straight slot screw
driver and the  sides of the slot have a tendency to break if too much force
is required to loosen them.  The bottom screws holding the access panel on
may be rusty too, requiring lots of torque and patience.  The gasket removal
and replacement is pretty straightforward.  Clean every thing up real good.
I used 3M weatherstripping cement to glue in the new seal.
I've never messed with the airflow selector.  I'll watch the list for
comments.  Good luck.
