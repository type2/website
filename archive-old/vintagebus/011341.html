I'll get some pics going of the progress this week.  I ordered the headliner
from WolfsburgWest.  I used scissors, utility knife, spray on glue (3m
brand).  I never really did get any advice to speak of, but about 3 years
back I think VW trends did a How-To article on it.  Above all I would say
that patience is the key and taking your time.  I've done little sections at
a time and gave myself breaks before I got frustrated.  The hardest part is
the front skylight windows, after that it's not too bad.  Dry fitting before
spraying on glue helps so you know kind of how you're going to have to
stretch and pull the thing.

&gt;  YEAH! Send me some pics!
&gt;  I have a 21 window and I'm really toying with doing it
&gt;  myself too. Where did you get instructions/advice or
&gt;  help?
&gt;  Did you need special tools/materials? Where did you
&gt;  get the headliner. I assume some are better than
&gt;  others?
