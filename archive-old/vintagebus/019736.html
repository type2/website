Got pix?  We had a nice little hailstorm here yesterday, got a pic of the '60

&gt; 3 tornado warnings in an hour.  Strong rotation but as of now, no touchdowns
&gt; reported.  It sure could have though - that was some mean looking stuff.  Ah
&gt; Nebraska - gotta love it.

&gt; ObVW:  The VWs are fine - matches the other little rock chips and dents that
&gt; are already there.
