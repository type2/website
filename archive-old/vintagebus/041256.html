Todd and List,

I am about to replace the Transform Whining Tranny &lt;tm&gt; with a Carter's 
unit (full priced rebuild with 3.88 r/p) and I would like to know where I 
can buy, rent or have built the several pullers required for the job.
The vehicle is a 12Volt 67 deluxe.

My options seem to be:

buying or renting from a preferably Bay Area listee, or

Buying an appropriate puller from, say Sears, and having an experienced 
listee or local machine shop make me the particular puller arms I need 
for the following operations:

Extracting the small upper outer ball bearing (6305) from the end of the 
main axle shaft (short reach required) once the outer half of the 
reduction box has been removed (and the retaining ring removed).

The following operations are for reduction box rebuilds and are not 
required for my present job:

Extracting the N207E roller bearing (lower outer) from the stub axle 
(long reach - 6-7 inches required).

Extracting the two upper and lower ball bearings (6306) from inside the 
inner half of the reduction box (short reach - 3 inches).

Can anyone help me on this stuff?

Thanks,

cal
