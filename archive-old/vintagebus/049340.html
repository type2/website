Michael:

The tent mounts/brackets are secured to the roof with carriage bolts, 4 per each bracket.  There is also a rubber seal, cut in the shape as the base of the bracket that sits between the bracket and the roof.  The original seal seems to be of a more brittle nature, maybe due to age, but the stuff still seems more plastic like.  I ended up using a softer rubber, similar to the vent frame to glass seals.
