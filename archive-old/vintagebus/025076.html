&gt; Hi,
&gt; Keep calling all of the other local tire shops.  This unfortunitly is the
&gt; first question when shopping for tires you should ask.  Someone has to have
&gt; the adapter.  We had to do the same thing and finally found one shop in
&gt; Olympia WA that had it.  Plus you might want to post your location and
&gt; someone near you might know the ansewer to this quest.

I did a short stint at a tire shop in highschool, and here is a good
trrick:

Ask them to &quot;cone up the wheel&quot; like they would balance a dual wheel.
The green kids at Les Schwabb probably can't handle this operation, but
any seasoned tire guy can use the cone adapter to work on the wide 5
pattern....
