Hi Kevin,
Well when you have finished getting the new engine installed and running 
right you should take your old engine and just start rebuilding it!  That way 
you can take the time to do it right, which only you can/will do it.  Then in 
a year or so you will have a spare engine and the knowledge that you did it 
yourself!    Eric&amp;Barb
