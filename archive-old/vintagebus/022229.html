Subject: Stephen Gutknecht's Double Cab Journey
Mime-Version: 1.0

	
Stephen Gutknecht just left my house bound for seattle in his new (to him)
'63 double cab that he bought this AM.

We changed the oil and transmission fluid, adjusted the brakes, cleaned the
engine, repacked the front wheel bearings, adjusted the clutch, and putzed
with a whole array of stuff to prepare him for his journey.

Wish him and his girlfriend luck!
