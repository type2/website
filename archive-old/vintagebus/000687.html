Many of us use our busses for daily drivers.  We forget that we pay mucho$$ 
for a fancy SUV and drive it daily and the price drops like a lead balloon.  
Why shouldn't a restored bus that is used for yeoman work also show 
depreciation?  I drive my bus because I enjoy it.  I put money into it to 
keep it safe and presentable because I want safe and presentable 
transportation.  Few people make money on cars, dealers excepted, or we would 
all be buying and selling cars at the speed of heat to become rich.  The 
enjoyment factor makes my bus worth much more than someone will pay me for it.
