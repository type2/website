&gt;I believe this now makes 4 sun roof deluxe, 3 hard top walk through deluxe,
2 hard
&gt;top bench seat deluxe, 2 bench seat Micros, 1 walk through Micro, 1 walk
through
&gt;Kombi, 2 westies, 2 double cab PU's, and one single cab PU split window
busses
&gt;along with 2 bay window westies and 10 standard bay windows at busses by the
&gt;barn.  I really feel sorry for those of you city
&gt;bound people who can't fill their yards with steel buildings full of busses
and feel the
&gt;good VW karma all around you!!

30 buses and only one driver? Volkswagens want to be driven every day.
 Sounds like 29 buses with a lot of down time. the karma on that smells a bit
funky to me.
