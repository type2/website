Subject: bus sighting... Steve Mielke CD

Hi All,

I do a radio show every friday morning... 'Dave Radio', 6-9am... 91.7 KEOL
LaGrande... yea, we used to feed to the internet but got shut down by da big
boys...but i digress,

anyway, i was in the middle of my alternative selections and i ran across a
CD by Steve Mielke, no address or further info on the cover... but on the
back side, there is a picture of a parking lot with a bay window parked in
the upper right corner... anybody with some further info?  I played the
first track...




David
