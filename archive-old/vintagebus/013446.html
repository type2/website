Close, but not entirely accurate...

The tray with the drain hose is only to catch the melt water, it's much
too flimsy to carry the weight of a bag or block of ice.

There should be a rack/shelf made of coated wire that fits above the melt
water collection tray.  This is where the ice bag/block rides.

This arrangement is fairly effective with the vehicle at rest.  While
traveling, as the ice melts, the melt water tends to slosh over the too
low sides of the tray and everything underneath gets wet.  On really long
drives the meltwater can leak out onto the floor and make a nasty mess.

We learned many years ago to enclose the bag/block of ice in a heavy
plastic bag to contain the melt water, then dispose of the water from
time to time during our journey.  This saves a lot of cleanup hassle, and
precludes stepping in a puddle of icewater on the camper floor when
heading to the sanitary facility in the middle of the night.

&gt;Actually, open door, put in block of ice, is the procedure, but a few 
&gt;things 
&gt;need to be in place first!  In my 1967 SO-42 here's how things went:
&gt;There should be a tray fitted in the ice box with a drain hole.  This 
&gt;is 
&gt;where you put the ice.  The drain hole should have a metal fitting on 
&gt;it to 
&gt;which a drain hose can be attached.  The bottom of the icebox should 
&gt;have a 
&gt;corresponding hole for the hose to go through.  The bottom of your bus 
&gt;should 
&gt;have a hole so that as the ice melts, it is collected by the tray; 
&gt;drains out 
&gt;through the hose and finally to the outside of the bus.  The hole in 
&gt;the 
&gt;bottom of the bus had a square of rubber or plastic (can't remember) 
&gt;with a 
&gt;slit for the hose to stick out.  That way outside water couldn't get 
&gt;in.
&gt;When the ice box drains and leaves a puddle helpful passer-bys will 
&gt;let you 
&gt;know that your radiator is leaking.
