 &gt; I recently obtained a (VWOA?) slide in style step for my 65' bus. The step 
 &gt; is common enough it has two brackets which slide into the jacking points 
 &gt; and is joined by a piece of brushed aluminum which foms the &quot;step&quot;.
  &gt;&gt;

I have what seems the same step.   I loosened the bolts holdingthe aluminium 
to the slide ins, cleared out the jack points of dirt and rocks as best i 
could with a pokey thing, used a rubber malletto help slide them in, 
tightened up the bolts.  There is a separate bit when a bolt goes through the 
jack points and through a brace, no it clips on but you do have to drill a 
hole in the jack point.   Hm, I'll try to take a pic cause I doubt this 
explanation helps much.

Anyway the step is very cool.  Not just for stepping into the bus, but for 
reaching the roof rack.
