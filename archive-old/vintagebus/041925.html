Subject: Tailpipe configuration for 1967?

Volks, 

As I approach finally getting the '67 on the road, I still have a couple
mysteries.  

In the process of assembling the exhaust I bought and have installed a
bus muffler, silencer and tailpipe.  All well and good.  The mystery is
that the silencer and tail pipe run over to the driver's side of the bus
and then point rearward.  Now, the valance for the '67 has a divot cut
into it that looks like the silencer for this year of bus originally came
straight back from the muffler, like a bug peashooter. I am willing to bet
that the muffler, silencer and tailpipe I bought were really made for a
'68-71 bus with a T1 engine and not a splittie.

Now a bug peashooter does not fit in the hole in my muffler for the
silencer, so if it did look like this, then it was a special peashooter
for the bus only.  Did this exist? does it? or was the '67 muffler special
in having a tube off the muffler that fit a bug peashooter? If so, does
there exist a single outlet (bus) muffler with an outlet that will fit a
bug peashooter?

Secondly, do you really have to remove the engine to adjust the clutch?  I
am only semi-serious on this one, but there is an undercurrent of
seriousness.  Between the frame, the axle tube, and the heater box, I can
just barely get my fingertips on the wing nut on the clutch cable.  Is
there a trick I do not know or is it supposed to be this difficult?  (BTW,
the nut appears to be rusted solid onto the cable, so I am pulling the
engine anyway :-(
