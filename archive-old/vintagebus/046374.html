They are both of the same style??  That is, one isn't
upright and the other angled over??  If so, the angled
one is for an alternator equipped car and takes a 
slightly shorter rod to operate.  If you orginally had
one of these and installed an upright generator
style then the push rod is too short for a good
stroke and it may not pump gas.  You are getting
fuel out of the pump-right??
