*Can someone please forward this to the vanagon list*

So I see a lot of fear all of the sudden from ppl saying &quot; oh my god, ppl
are actually using MY information for its intended purpose!&quot; or &quot; whoa!
anyone and everyone can access my info?? wtf??&quot;

the AIRS info has been made available to anyone from day one.  And from day
one the sign up form has said: &quot;Your info will be made available to *anyone*
looking at the pages&quot;
As of now:
  Any joe schmoe who types www.type2_dot_com into their browser has access to
the AIRS site.
  Any joe schmoe who types &quot;type2&quot; into their favorite search engine can
stumble across the type2 site (it was #3 on hotbot),  which leads them to
the AIRS site.
    If i were to all of the sudden put a pass on the site, that still doesnt
eliminate anyone of the current 500 members from givin out a sheet of a
state to their buddy. And even with a pass, all someone would have to do is
join AIRS or the mailing list and wah-la they have access to all info.
If someone DOES contact you, you are not required to help unless they are
already signed up.
Plenty of ppl didn't add their email address to their signup form, which i
assume is to avoid spam, and marked &quot;emergency only&quot; on their form.
 ( I have recieved very  little spam since I started using the net, and
havin my email address in about 20 locations on the AIRS site didn't
increase spam.... call me lucky?)
Why does someone being on the mailing list or off the mailing list change
anything? Are they not still &quot;interepid bus travelers in need of help&quot;?

 So I see 2 discussed issues - non listees havin access and potential e-mail
spam
 Lets review the suggested Fake solutions:
#1 put a pass -   Doesn't stop anyone who DOES have the pass from giving out
the pass or giving out a list of the info. Also doesn't stop anyone from
joining to obtain the pass and names.
#2 put a pass that changes all the time -  see answers for #1, #3, #4 and
ken's response
#3 take the AIRS link off the type2 site to make it harder to find -    Word
of mouth gets around, and with almost 500 members across the world.....
#4 make it list members only -    So someone joins the list and then unsubbs
after needed info is aquired. What about the 100's of NON list ppl that are
already AIRS members? kick them off AIRS?
 Does joining the list automatically make you a honest, truthful, awesome
bus person?

Trying to keep &quot;strangers&quot; out seems like it destroys the whole point of the
site. The net makes things easier(such as signing up for a club) which is
what makes the AIRS site grow so fast and large. Again, the whole point is
makin your info available TO the average traveling stranger.(they wouldnt be
a stranger if they already knew your personal info ;)

I have only received 1 email from a person wanting their name removed since
the site was put up last year.
Any and all suggestions welcomed by list mail or p-mail if everyone thinks
this is a serious issue. Guess ill have to have another talk with charlie.

&gt;--It *is* possible to scrape email addresses from the AIRS map site. If you
&gt;put your address in there spammers might get hold of it. Wade will probably
&gt;remove your email address if you ask him to. Personally I think it is worth
&gt;the risk and my address is in there but you have to make your own decision.
&gt;--Even if we were to password the AIRS site and limit access to listees
&gt;(which would be difficult and high-maintenance, but possible) you need to
&gt;understand that 1600 people or so will STILL have access to any information
&gt;you allow to be published. Among any group of 1600 people, some are
&gt;probably wierdos. If you are squeamish about having your address/phone
&gt;number on the web where people can see it, you should not be in the AIRS
&gt;map IMO whether it is passworded or not.
&gt;--Discussions about the nature of human altruism are interesting and all,
&gt;but they are off-topic: at issue is whether the AIRS site should be public
&gt;or limited to listees. (Imagine you are on the road for two months. You can
&gt;probably find ways to get to the web but I wonder whether you can be sure
&gt;you are still subscribed to the list/still in the AIRS &quot;permitted list&quot;.
&gt;Email addresses get unsubscribed all the time because of network wrinkles.
&gt;Ask me how I know. =^ )

&gt;&gt;The AIRS site was intended to help the members of this list, and help us
&gt;&gt;build more community than simply replying to each others e mails.  It was
&gt;&gt;intended as a goodwill gesture totally.
&gt;&gt;I think some people's worries about the site being public are
well-founded.
&gt;&gt;I would hate to know that some leech was pulling names and selling them to
&gt;&gt;spam generators and such.  I would almost be tempted to find that person
and
&gt;&gt;practice the good old southern religious move of &quot;laying on of hands&quot;.
&gt;&gt;I would love to see AIRS stay public and free, but as it grows it's going
to
&gt;&gt;be much more difficult to do that, and protect the names of the people
that
&gt;&gt;are legitimately registered on the site.  Wade and I spoke about this when
&gt;&gt;we first created the site, but we may have to reconsider and change some
&gt;&gt;amount of direction.
