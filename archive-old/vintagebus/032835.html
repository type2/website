 Has anyone ever tried to install a Rabbit VDO oil temperature gauge and
 sender into an upright VW engine?  I plan on doing that to my `63 Camper
 with a SP 1600.  I have a good working gauge and sender out of a `79
 rabbit...I am told with a T-fitting I can install the Rabbit sender at
 the stock idiot oil light....

Hi Todd,
That is the area we use for oil temp right now with a VDO temp gauge in a T-
fitting with the temp sender on the top to read the hotter oil circulating
into to T-fitting.  Just recently did a test with our calibrated (To 212F)
Stork oil dipstick mechanical temp gauge.  When the electrical temp gauge
shows about 210F the Stork gauge showed 218F which is close enough for us.  As
to other folk who claim that the oil sump is the place to install a sender, it
has alot more air passing and water spray to cool here.  Also this placement
cuts off the sender due to being under the bottom of the stainer and being on
the bottom of the sump is the coolest place to be.  Reme4mber that heat rises
and cool sinks.  Plus the sump location is a bad place for wiring to be
hanging.  The two best places for a oil temp sender would probably be the plug
at the end of the oil pick up tube which is on the lower back side of the
engine, or the plug that is in the engine compartment to the upper left of the
rear pulley on the rear of the engine case.  The former would be right in the
oil flow and the latter would be compleatly in a oil passage that would get
good temp readings from alot larger circulation while not blocking the smaller
upper oil passages.  Plan to try the upper one in the next engine we build and
see how it does compared to the other two sender placements we have.
