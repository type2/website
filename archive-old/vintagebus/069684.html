Subject: Re: [VB] Dealer LP training machine

Ah so THATS what that was! The guy who sold me the Dealer microfische machine was asking me what i
thought that &quot;other machine&quot; was.. About the size of the microfische machine, has nothing except the
typical controls on the front, stop play rewind etc. the place where you put the &quot;tape&quot; is weird
looking, not VHS, bout half the length of a VHS tape and taller then a VHS tape. It works, and has
sound when you hit play even though there was no &quot;tape&quot; to put in it. I didnt pay much attention to
it as i thought it was a BETA tape player even though it didnt look like the right size, been a
while since ive seen a BETA tape. I suppose 35mm film strips would be what goes in it, ill have to
go back over and look. the previous owner of that storage locker mustve been a VW dealer at one
time. Cant wait to see what the box that he hasn't gone through yet has in it.

&gt; &gt; ps. still looking for the machine that reads the dealer training lp's with
&gt; &gt; the 35 mm film strips. I have over 60 of the dealer training lp/film strip
&gt; &gt; with little test booklets
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; Wonder if those are the same machines I used to use back in junior high
&gt; (mid 70's) during self study classes.  They were small units that you
&gt; put rolled up 35 mm film strips into and then you took tests/studied on
&gt; a viewer at a cubicle. BTW for all you little tikes this was pre-VHS
&gt; days.
&gt;
&gt; Maybe look at/in obsolete school supply places.  Just a thought.
