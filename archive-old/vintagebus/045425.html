Subject: fresh air system
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

what would be the best way of going about cleaning out and possibly putting 
new parts in the fresh air vent in the cab? do i just remove the plate and 
see for myself, or is there a better way? im just asking because i dont want 
(or like) to mess things up. info always appreciated--thanks
