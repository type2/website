A few questions...

Well, I'm down to a few last parts that I still need for the 59 double cab.

Anybody got a nice set of used or NOS vent wing locks and a passenger side
front window latch????

With all the talk on mirrors, my 59 only has a post on the drivers side and
I like the looks of the small round one.  Can you find NOS or nice originals
around???

And how about the inside rear view mirror?  Mine came with one stamped with
a F*rd logo (?).  It looks old and nice but not VW.

Oh, and also, there is an ashtray screwed into the cab divider for the
people in the back seat on the passenger side.  It doesn't look too factory
but was cut in nicely... might it be an option?  Actually, the styling of
the ashtray matches that of the F*rd rear view mirror... go figure.

Thanks


Dave
