I'm gonna go ahead and post this message in advance of my departure.  I've
already made the announcment previously but just in case all of you missed
it or even give a damn, here we go again.

Rob &amp; Justin Laffoon as well as myself are heading to Kansas City Friday
June 1st in the evening.  We, as well as Dan Kinsey from Florida (KCMO
native), will be attending the MoKan show on Saturday.  I know it's gonna be
hard to pull myself from the show but around noon or so we will have to head
out towards Topeka, KS and meet up with Rick Taylor in order to make our
first stop/campout in Kanopolis, KS.

Sunday we hope to plod down highway 56 toward Dodge City, KS and then jog
south of there towards highway 54.  Eventually Tucumcari, NM will come into
view letting us know Albuquerque, NM is over the horizon.  Lake Havasu City
and the boys beckon us so I40 will be our yellow brick road to there.  We've
been promised the red carpet treatment - they know how to lure you back
there. :-)

Oceanside, CA is where our host Don Boneau resides and we hope to make it
there sometime Thursday if luck is with it but we'll see what happens.

You'll be looking for a green 1966 single cab as found at
http://www.buskatiers_dot_com/2001/events/lastminute/april/sc-prep2.htm
and Rick Taylor will be in his orange baywindow Westy towing a 21 window.

Of course NQ is the big fat guy in overalls and headband.  That almost goes
without explanation.

Follow us virtually on our trip at
http://www.buskatiers_dot_com/2001/events/lastminute/april/sc-prep.htm

Contact with me on the road can be handled at buskatiers_at_kickassmail_dot_com and
voice mail is handled at 402-520-0551

The P133 laptop that I'm borrowing to write trip reports with was just
delivered here as I typed this message so the puzzle pieces are falling into
place.  Please come up and say hello to me if you see me.  I'd like to meet
as many listees as possible on this trip.  It's my first time to Southern
Cali EVER.  Talk about a fish out of water...

NQ
