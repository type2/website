 I've just picked up a '64 Sundial camper and am itching to do some
 traveling.  However, concerns for the family's safety does need to take
 priority.  I've searched the archives and found limited info on the possible
 options for installing rear seatbelts.  I can't seem to locate any plastic
 plugs or other such things that might indicate a mounting point for the
 belts. Navigating the belts around the fold out cot also seems to present a
 problem.  The open roads are a callin', but I can't answer until I can belt
 in the kids!  Any help is appreciated.

I think in 66 or so there were mounts buildt in for the rear belts.  So if 
you dont have them, you need to dril holes to mount them.  use a large item 
on the under side as a huge washer to spread the weight in case of them being 
in emergency use.   I used 12&quot; or so pieces of spring steel that once were VW 
leaf springs when I installed front 
belts in my 61.  They are hard to drill.
