Hi NQ, 
The thing is you do essentially the same thing by hooking a hose to the tip 
of the bleeder valve.  Sticking the other end of this hose in a jar with a 
little brake fluid in the bottom that is enough to cover the open tip of the 
hose.  Then when you pump the pedal the old fluid with any air is pushed out 
the hose into the bottle.  When you release the pedal the hose sucks up a 
little of the old fluid, but no air.  VW has had a special bottle/tool for 
this for decades.  
  The valve idea is nice, but could get clogged with crud in the old brake 
fluid.  Plus if the spring, ball valve, and bleeder valve body are not made 
of a good quality non-corrosive material the parts of this one way bleeder 
valve will just stick up.
