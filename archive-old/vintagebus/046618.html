&lt;&lt; My flywheel is 6 volt.
 My clutch is 200mm.
 Flywheel came from a Karmann Ghia...
 Don't know what year or anything. &gt;&gt;
Hi Chris,
If memory serves right the 1965 K. Ghia came stock with this 200mm with 6 
volt geared flywheel.  One can also have thier 12 volt flywheel teeth 
machined off and a new 6 volt ring gear pressed on at local flywheel shops.  
If you are building a new engine you would do well to have the pulley, 
crankshaft, flywheel, and pressure plate professionally balanced at the same 
time.  Or if the engine is already together to at least balance the flywheel 
with the pressure plate.   Eric&amp;Barb
