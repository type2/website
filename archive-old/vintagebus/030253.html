Hello there,
Does anyone know where I can get a 6V 200mm flywheel??  I know VW made
them... but they aren't that easy to find... I think all the dune buggy
guys swiped em a while back... 8-)
Anyone have one of these?  Does anyone make them?  I looked at Kennedy
Engineering's website...but they don't show anything...maybe I'd have to
call them..
any suggestions?

Isaiah
