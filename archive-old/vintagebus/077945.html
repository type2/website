Subject: Daily Driver and stuff

Hello Volks!
   I am moving to Nashville at the end of the month and taking a new job which
will require me to travel frequently.  Being that I have never left my bus at
the airport in airport parking, has anyone else? and has it been without
incident?  Reason is I am considering purchasing a daily driver and would have
to leave it at the airport from time to time.  Any list members live in or
around Nashville?  If so, could you pm me.  I would like to bounce some
questions off of you about where to live or more importantly where not to
live.

Thanks

Bart Daugherty
