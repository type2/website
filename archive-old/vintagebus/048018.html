 most likely I will end up running a 1600 singleport instead, but I would
 like to make a running engine out of these 2 if I could. &gt;&gt;
Hi Jamie,
About the only things you can use from 36 to 40 HP and visa versa is the fan 
shroud, threaded fasteners, 180mm clutch disc, pressure plate, spark plug 
wires, the spark plugs, and maybe the oil pump.  The best thing you could 
probably do is to box the 36 HP engine after disassembly, cleaning, and 
discarding bad parts is to rebuild the 40 HP engine.  The 40 HP uses mostly 
the same parts as the 1600cc engine.  The 40 HP is a good starter engine to 
try your hand at engine rebuild due to availibilty of parts.  The 36 HP is 
much harder to find some parts and more expen$ive!   Eric&amp;Barb
