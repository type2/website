&gt; the most reliable, fun to drive, would take it ANYWHERE vehicles I've ever

&gt; sure lovin' mine. I drive it everyday.

Yer right! I've been drivin my 67 for 25 yrs now, I agree. But i believe
that you don't need a &quot;good one&quot;. Any splittie that hasn't been totally
trashed can be cleaned up to be a 'good one', and drive great. Example - I
bought a 64 about 18 months ago to do the daily grinding and give the 67 a
well-earned rest. Its ride sucked the big one. Jerky, grindy, wobbly, you
name it. But the body was straight and rust free. New front drums cured
the wobbles, new smoothruning engine cured the jerkies and grindys, a
valve adjustment every 2K, no other problems or failures at all, and it
didn't even fail during all the junky months,as i fixed it up. 

These buses are inherently reliable, and just need small occassional
mainetance. If you go thru them once and check and fix 'em up where they
need it, they run long periods with no problems, almost like T*y*t*as and
all those other 'road roaches'. Eh, but there's no plastic cup holders!
