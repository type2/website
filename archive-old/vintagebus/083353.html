Someone gave me this years ago and its what i use, works great. Im not sure 
where youd get one of these now (you could probably make your own easily 
enough)

Just slides right under the bench seat and easily removable in seconds if 
you decided you didnt want it in there at a show. No holes, no hanging.

&gt; Now down to the important stuff. Where is the best place to hang a cup
&gt; holder in the cab? My guess is that under the wing window works pretty 
&gt; well.
&gt; What is best? A solid holder or one of those fancy swinging gimballed 
&gt; units?
&gt; Let me know where you put your's.
