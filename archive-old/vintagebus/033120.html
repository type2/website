hi everybody! (Dr. Nick voice)
vwdormobile_dot_com has some more updates. we have about 100+ pictures up plus
more &quot;other dormobile&quot; pictures. we also have a message board so everyone
can get on and leave messages when they are bored at work. fun for all! i
would really like to see people make use of this message board and have fun
with it. everyone can have more specific discussions that they may not be
able to do on here with out mass confusion. so swing on by and check it out.
also again, if you have any links you want me to put up, email them to me.
my address is fully functional now. no more mail server errors. Thanks for
your time.
