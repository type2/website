Hi everybody,
I did a compression test for the first time today, since the
local shop wanted twice as much as the cost of the tester tool I
bought.
I really don't know what to make of the results though:
#1 - 130
#2 - 135
#3 - 120
#4 - 132

I don't know if it matters, but the tester screws in, and the
motor turned over about 5-6 times for each test.  I'm hoping
somebody can point me in the right direction.  I didn't search
the archives 'cause I'm really really bad at it (I couldn't even
find the messages about me and my trip) please don't flame me :-)

well #1, #2 and #4 are all really close together, while #3 is lower.  #3 gets 
more wear.   But they are all above 100 and about 10 lbs span, so okay.  130 
seems kinda high to me.   but whatever.   it ain't broke, dont worry about 
it.   

my anecdote:   I checked the compression on my 1st splitt- 120 on 1,2 , and 
4, and 105 on 3.  Okay, a bit worn.  A couple years later it acted funny and 
I checked it again, 1 was down to 65, time for fixing.
