&gt; 
&gt; Went camping last weekend in St. Augustine and ran across the Franklin Mint 
&gt; model bus.  Has anyone actually purchased one of these wallet behemoths.  
&gt; ($135.00)  Just interested to know if anyone has them for sale, maybe $20 or 
&gt; $25.  Just asking, reply only to me, I don't want anyone else to get my 
&gt; deal.......  Good thing it is Friday, limited technological expertise and 
&gt; all I get a day.

What, it was parked in a campground slot at Anastasia?  With Tiny Elvis 
aboard?  &quot;Man, look at that Winnebago!  That Winnebago's HUUUGE, man! 
No wait, that's a truck with a tilt!&quot;

Yeah, they're pricey but IMHBCO they kick *ss.  Real cloth operating 
sunroof, real operating sliders, folding backrest on the full width 
middle seat, etc.  Not all the details are absolutely spot on, but it's 
a honey.  Far cooler than the Beetle model (although I like their Beetle 
'vert).

What I wanna do is put it on the trailer behind my Road &amp; Track bus. 
That's as unlikely a scene as you'll get, except maybe a FM bus model 
for $20-25. ;-)

Now the real sh*t would be to find an antique 1/25 Studebaker portable 
parking lot and create a diorama resembling what we saw at Jerome this 
year, replete with accurately detailed quilt-pattern bra on de RustyBus. 
  How come guys have time to build way-detailed scratch models of WWII 
ships but not something really important like this?  Huh?  Tell me.
