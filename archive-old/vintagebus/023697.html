Subject: New License Plates Available Soon!!!!

Please excuse me if this is a repost. I am having trouble with my mail.

Greetings!

My wife and I have decided to take a dip into the world or specialty
marketing. I won't bore you with the details on all the thought
processes that brought us to this decision, but I will tell you that it
arose out of looking through my new RMMW catalog and  a desire for
something different.

What I am going to offer are list specific license plates for each of
the 3 bus mailing lists. The examples can be seen at
http://www.fament_dot_com/chip/vw/plates.html. At this site there are 2
examples for each list. The price will be $12.50 USD. This price
includes $3 for  priority mail shipping within the Continental US.
Foreign orders will have to pay whatever the extra shipping is.

Because I need to order at 50 of each design I am going to sell, it is
probably best that we choose one design or the other.
If you are interested and think you will order one( or more) please
e-mail me the following information.
Please put plates in the subject so my mail will filter it correctly.
Then tell me how many and what list plate and which design you prefer.
If you only like one and would not buy one of the others PLEASE tell me
that as well.

    Example:
    1-vintagebus-big VW
    1-type2- small VW  &quot;will not buy big VW&quot;
    1- vanagon- smallvw

I hope to have an idea of what I will be able to offer by Friday July
3rd, after which time I will begin taking actual orders and will detail
that process then. After I turn the order in to the manufacturer it
should take 7-10 days for me to get them, and then a couple of days to
get them sent out.

Please,  direct all comments, questions, etc regarding this to me via
PMAIL.
Thank you for your time.
Sincerely,

Chip Shaner (da family man.....)
