Subject: RE: [VB] Fuel Injection in a Split?

&gt;Has anybody ever managed to put a fuel injected engine in a split window
bus?&lt;

I guess this question can read two ways.  A FI Beetle case in a split or 
putting FI in a split motor.  Either way, yes.

There are numerous FI conversion to pick from.  The easiest might be the 
Beetle L-Jet system as you can get parts and stock intake hardware easily.  
But for some reason not many people like L-Jet.  The majority of the 
conversions are to CIS FI and stealing a combination of Beetle intakes and 
Rabbit/Audi FI parts.

Lots of great advice here:  http://shoptalkforums_dot_com/viewforum.php?f=23

Here is a ready to buy CIS FI kit:  http://www.sandrail_dot_com/millerfi/

Here is a L-Jet Beetle intake I am using for a CIS install on a T5 motor 
conversion:

Ask away on anything you need.
