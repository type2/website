X-mas eve is a &quot;friday&quot;, right?   How many on the list have flipped a bus or 
tipped it on its side?

 &gt; away, we found this article clipped from the local paper for Elgin,
 &gt; Texas. After doing a little research with some of the sports info on

 They likely flipped it back over and drove it off.
