I thought I could resist getting into this discussions, but I guess I
can't 8^).

&gt; 
&gt; &quot;I make about 67 MPH (tested to be accurate) at about 4000
&gt; RPM with 26.5&quot;
&gt; diameter tires and I know I have (or at least paid for) a
&gt; 4.125 R&amp;P and that
&gt; pretty much corresponds to the speed/rev table that was
&gt; posted.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; If I read his post correctly, even with a 1776 and dual
&gt; 40's, he still finds his top speed limited to 67 mph _at_4Krpm.
&gt; I believe everything he wrote; I've had the same experience.

When I look back at his post sent at 11:56 I see:

  -- I am running a 1600cc Dual Port engine and will be switching to
dual
Kadron 40mm carburetors.  I am also considering ratio rockers, but not
yet
decided.

&gt; If all Mike can pull is 67mph _at_4Krpm in 4th, I think my
&gt; point is made. Will anyone argue that 4Krpm is to high for
&gt; freeway driving? And in 4th gear he can't seem to do any
&gt; better;&lt;) Has anyone on the list got a split that can pull
&gt; 5Krpm in 4th? I don't believe it can be done with a stock
&gt; setup.

I don't have a tach, unfortunately, but I can easily get my dual port
stock carb crewcab up to 70 mph and cruise there. I can go faster than
that and sometimes do when I'm passing, but I don't cruise that fast
since I don't want to build another engine for a while. I have a 4.125
r/p, big nut tranny, and 205/70R14 tires on the truck. If that isn't 5K
it must be awfully close. This engine has a CW crank.

My bus has dual 34 ICT webers and a CW crank in a 1600 DP. I can make
the speedo needle point straight back at me, I guess that's about 90
mph. That must be more than 5K rpm. I'm sure that would kill the engine
(or me) if I tried to do it for more than just a few minutes. Same
tranny and tires as the truck, BTW.

&gt; 
&gt; The source for the rpm limiters is the BERG '96 catalogue,
&gt; pg. 87-88. They recommend a 5.8Krpm cutout for all T2s
&gt; because of &quot;low gear ratios.&quot; He claims that he had a 50%
&gt; increase in head life using a 5,850rpm limiter in his T2.
&gt; 
&gt; BENTLEY lists the 1500 engine as having an output of SAE 51
&gt; bhp _at_4Krpm as the maximum output. Exactly the limit Mike
&gt; found.
&gt; 
&gt; BENTLEY lists the 1200 40hp using a 4.125R/P W/1.39RG as
&gt; yielding 60mph _at_3.6Krpm as the top road speed using 26&quot;
&gt; tires. The 1500 51hp using a 4.125R/P W/1.26RG gets 68mph
&gt; _at_3.8Krpm. Using the 4.375R/P, 65mph _at_4050rpm.
&gt; 
&gt; So even a stronger engine will not make you go any faster.
&gt; You can there quicker, but you don't go no faster.
&gt; 

The only reason I posted this was because it has been my experience that
a stronger *will* make you go faster. The cost of that extra speed will
probably be seen as shorter engine life as well as higher fuel expenses.
I limit my speed to 70 mph, not because the bus or truck won't go
faster, but mainly so my engine will last longer. If I can get a tranny
that will let me go faster for the same rpm, I might drive a little
faster. The decision will then be based on safety considerations.

That's my story and I'm sticking with it. 8^)
