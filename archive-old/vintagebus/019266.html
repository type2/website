I'm having a problem with my turn signals and hazards on the Westy.  I've 
checked the wiring and it all seems to be connected correctly.  The behavior
is that the turn signals work now, but flash twice as fast as the hazards (I 
think because I do not have lights connected in back yet).  The hazards flash
at a normal speed, but no power is sent to the rear lights.  I've been messing
around with stuff for a while with no results.  There is power to the rear 
lights when using the turn signals, but not the hazards.

Matt Roberds' very excellent piece in the library only helped to verify that
everything was apparently as it should be, which just bothers me more :-)

Please help me before I go crazy.  It's a 12V '67 w/original 9 prong box.
Thanks!
