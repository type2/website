Subject: Will trade for or buy Yellow Vinyl material

Howdy Y'all!
Has anybody out there got any yellow vinyl upholstery material from a 68-71 Westy that they can spare?  I only need enough to cover the rear facing jump seat.  If someone has the vinyl that came from a jump seat that would be PERFECT, but I will also take scraps and piece it together to make my own covering if need be.  I have a bunch of split bus parts (engine &amp; clutch parts too!) and a few bay parts I can trade or I can buy it from you.  OR, is there a source for getting this stuff new??




Peace, John Baker
