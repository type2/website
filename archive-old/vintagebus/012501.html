Hey, my friend has been building his 23 window for over 5 years. We drove
it the other day but it just died and we can't figure out why. OK, here's
the deal; it has an electric fuel pump with dual carbs on a 1600. It also
has a new wiring harness and an altenator with an internal regulator. When
we first got it running, we accidently installed a voltage regulator with
the altenator. We started the bus and got going so fast we had to shut the
safari windows, then 10 minutes after we got it going, it just died. No
power to the fuel pump the we could hear, and the engine wouldn't turn
over. The lights did still work though. So today we took the voltage
regulator out and got it started again by jumping the bus with a spare
battery. It was running really good until 10 minutes again when it just
stopped. No power, and the whole 9 yards. We changed the fuse that goes to
the coil ('cause that's what we have the fuel pump running off of) and it
ran again for only 10 minutes. The fuel hose isn't getting hot and vapor
locking, and the fuses and wiring look good. So what's the deal? we've
basically run out of ideas. I'm going over after work tomarrow to try to
figure it out, so if anybody has any suggestions they would be greatly
appreciated since we HAVE to get this bus done before Manassas in May, and
it's not looking too good right now.
