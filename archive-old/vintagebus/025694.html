Bryan,

First off, WD-40 is NOT a penetrating oil.  Here in the US, the penetrating
oils of choice seem to be, Kroil, Liquid Wrench or either GM or
Daimler-Chrysler heat riser lubricant.  Kroil and the GM/ D-C stuff get rave reviews.

Get the right stuff and give it another go.

&gt; Ok here is the delemia. On my 65 delux I can seem to get any of the
&gt; bolts loose on the door hinges or the bolts that hold the window frame
&gt; to the door. The bolts want to strip but there not there yet. Any good
&gt; ideas on how to get these stubborn bolts moving? If they do strip what
&gt; do I have to do to fix the problem?  I sprayed WD 40 at them and that
&gt; didn't help either.
&gt; Thanks in advance for any responses.
