Subject: Train car with 2 Buses

Friday stuff...

If anyone is interested in model trains, MTH makes a
freight car that carries two 23 window Buses! You can
check out a couple of photos at:

Also, at the local train store here in Reno they have
about ten working model Bay Window style Single Cab
Trucks that are marked/used as 'train utility
vehicles' which have their own motors to run around
the tracks under their own power. These are pretty
cool...about 50$ each, I'm sure I will get myself one soon.
