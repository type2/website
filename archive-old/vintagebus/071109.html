Subject: Re: [VB] Deluxe headliner

I helped a local guy attempt to install a head liner in his sunroof deluxe
and the first time it hit 95 degrees the whole thing dropped out.  We where
using 3m #90 that was recomened to him by TMI. He took it to an upolstery
shop and they laughed at the choice of glue. The pros reccomended using glue
made to install those vinyl tops so popular on ugly 70's cars. It's made to
take temperature extremes. The stuff he used was brush on and relatively
inexpensive.



&gt; I know there is plenty of adhesive needed.  What type?  Spray?  Contact?
I
&gt; suppose we also need to install the windshields and fixed side windows
once the
&gt; headliner is installed (?).  All suggestions and advice are very welcomed.
