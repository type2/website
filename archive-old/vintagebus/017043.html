I have seen plenty-o-gals at VW shows in what I like to call &quot;inappropriate car show attire&quot;.  This includes very uncomfortable looking shoes (that the girl usually can't walk well in), very short dresses on windy days (although that is a guy crowd pleaser), and all sorts of extremely tight and uncomfortable looking clothing.  I don't know if they come to the shows looking for a man and think tight clothes and platform shoes they can't walk in are the ways to get one, or what...
They sure are fun to watch though...guess I'm easily amused.  : )

(wears comfy clothes and tennis shoes to shows, except Jerome..then I'm in coveralls)
