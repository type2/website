Steve,

You are correct.  I should have been a little more
clear there.  My goal is not to do a show type paint
job.  I will either use a good Epoxy Primer or some
cheaper paint.  The goal is to keep the rust out but
not to have a bus that i do not mind using to carry
stuff around.  The bus will be parked in a garage so
the only water it should see is an occasional washing
and any unplanned use in the rain.

95% complete.  Well, now that you bring it up, maybe
not all the metal is that complete.  I was more
talking about the rest of the parts for the bus.

Thanks again for the input.
Matthew

&gt; &gt; Over all the bus is in good shape.  It is 95%

&gt; (More
&gt; &gt; then i have ever tackled though)  The goal is to
&gt; get
&gt; &gt; all the rust repaired, sand blast it, do the body
&gt; work
&gt; &gt; and leave it in primer.
&gt; 
&gt; Not a good plan. Primer is &quot;not&quot; a waterproof
&gt; product. It is designed to be
&gt; sprayed immediately before the final coats of
&gt; &quot;waterproof&quot; paint are
&gt; applied. If you leave your truck unprimered for very
&gt; long, moisture will
&gt; seep into the primer and ruin all that bodywork.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; The worst parts of it are:
&gt; &gt; -  Driver door is shot.  Rusty and bowed
&gt; &gt; -  Passenger door rusty but i think repairable
&gt; &gt; -  Front lower 3&quot; of nose rusted away
&gt; &gt; -  ding in nose from over rider contact
&gt; &gt; -  Some rocker rust under 3rd door
&gt; &gt; -  Rear heater tube cross support gone
&gt; &gt; -  Many extra holes in cab area
&gt; &gt; -  Some extra non-factory ripples in the bed
&gt; 
&gt; Did you say this bus was 95% complete (?)
