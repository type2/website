&lt;&lt; I liked the point that using a cell phone and driving cause more accidents 
 than drinking and driving.     Should make people think.  &gt;&gt;

I don't think that's true.  I just read an article about that (but, of 
course, can't remember where), but the major distraction that caused 
accidents was people eating or drinking (like coffee or soft drinks) while 
driving.  Cell phone use was way down on the list, like 2 or 3 percent of the 
distractions that cause inattention to safe vehicle operation.  Not that I'm 
advocating driving while phoning (or is it phoning while driving?).
