 I was wondering the the lock mechanism from a &quot;T&quot; rear hatch handle 
 can be put into an early ('60) drivers side pull handle.
 
 Here's why. My '59 currently has a no lock handle on the driver's 
 side. I've got a handle with a place for a lock...but the actual lock 
 mechanism is gone...leaving a hollw round hole more or less.
 
 I've also got a &quot;t&quot; latch handle that used to be on the rear hatch. 
 The it broke off and the previous owner put a new &quot;t&quot; handle on, 
 leaving the broken one for me to throw in my stash pile.
 
 So I was hoping to remove the round lock mechanism from the &quot;t&quot; 
 handle and install it in the driver pull handle. Then a nice trip to 
 the local mom &amp; pop locksmith to get keys made for the whole bunch of 
 'em.
 
 If the swap can be made, let me know the details of how to do it. I 
 don't see anything about the &quot;t&quot; handle in my reprint of the bently.
 
 Thanks in advance.

I havent tried that, but usually the cylinders are different.  to try, undo 
the tiny slotted screw holding the lock cylinder in the T handle.  use the 
correct small screw driver as you dont want to mess up the screw head.  put a 
key in teh cylinder and use it to remove the cylinder.  leave the key in or 
the little wafers may fall out. does the cylinder fit in the front door 
handle?   let us know.
