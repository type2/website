&gt; street car which can be reworked regularly.  But to expect to throw in an
&gt; aftermarket part and expect longevity and ease of use which is similar to
&gt; the OEM part is unrealistic.

    i can see how people who don't educate themselves correctly could be
disappointed... it's the dark secret of this or any other automotive
platform.

    i can also see that uneducated people are often too cheap to pay gene
berg for parts combos that have been repeatedly proven to all work together,
and live a long life.

    but having driven type 1, dual-carbed, stroker engines for well over 80k
miles, i know for a fact that it can be done, with great results... and no
need for chokes or vacuum advance distributors  :-)

    your mileage may vary, depending on who you listened to when you were
educating yourself about vw's.
