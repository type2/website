In case you're not all sick of the topic, here's my fuel filter tale of woe:

While I had my motor out, I decided to clean out the gas tank, as I'd been
going thru filters like crazy.  I was shocked to see about 4 cups worth of
crud come out of there.  It looked like flakes of rust and dirt.  We put
rocks in and shook it around with water in it several times (like 20) to try
to get all the flakes to come out, then rinsed with gas to get the water
out.

But... now the filter is plugging up even faster.  It seems to be all very
fine particles now, but I've gone through 4 filters in 800 miles.  This is
ridiculous.  However, I don't see any sign of them exploding.  The motor
starts to kind of stutter, I pull over, remove the now dark-rusty-brown
filter (causing large amounts of crud and gas to explode all over me from
the inlet side) then continue on.  I don't know if the magnet trick would
work, maybe I'll give it a try.  Also planning to add another filter before
the pump.  I wonder if my carb is full of crud??  Probably.  &lt;sigh&gt;
