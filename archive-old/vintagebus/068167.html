Subject: Re: [VB] upper  engine bolt.  aaargh

Is there a trick to getting that engine bolt through without pulling the
motor?  
------------------ Clip ----------------------
My crankcase has a threaded steel plug there.
The bolt just goes through the bell housing into the steel plug.
Its a pain but it does go in.
