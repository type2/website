when you have the tranny out and the axle tubes and axles off, you undo the 
next circles on nuts- for the side covers.  one side covers has the ring gear 
attached.   swap them side to side, probably a good idea to use new paper 
gaskets underneath them.  This does not get you into the gear stacks.   
Haven't actually done this and driven it, but its is what i've been told 
others have done, and I've taken the side covers off and seen what is in 
there.

&lt;&lt; Ok, just for the sake of learning....how do you flip
 the ring gear in the dif?  I have the general idea,
 but like the gear stack or other things in the tranny,
 do you need any special tools to do this.  Do you need
 to set this ring gear to any specs...ya know end play
 side play ect.  Or can you just pull the tranny, pull
 the axles-tubes ect..take off the side
 plates...wooooop flip the ring gear to the other
 side...bolt it together and voila!
