Subject: Re: [VB] Bus and a BUG question

Hi John,
I have the same problem if I run lower octane gas,
mine will ping under a load such as climbing hills,
just before downshifting to 3rd. If I run high octane,
this never happens. My 2cents. 
Thanks,

&gt; Howdy Y'all,
&gt; First of all since this is a BUS list, here's the
&gt; bus question: I noticed on
&gt; my '71 Westy (1600 DP) that inside the gas filler
&gt; door there is a little
&gt; sticker that says &quot;Oktan Min. 91 ROZ&quot; I am assuming
&gt; that this is german
&gt; recommending using gas with a 91 or higher octane
&gt; rating (A genius, aren't I!)
&gt; Anyway here's the question: Would using a lower
&gt; octane rating (economy 87)
&gt; cause a very faint, almost un-noticable pinging when
&gt; the engine is under load
&gt; at higher RPM's (i.e. climbing a hill in 4th gear
&gt; just before downshifting)? 
&gt; I have always thought that the higher octane rating
&gt; gasoline was just a
&gt; money-making scam, but after having used the higher
&gt; octane gas, It seems to
&gt; have erased this previously mentioned &quot;pinging&quot;. Am
&gt; I mistaken, wishful
&gt; thinking, or is this probably true?
&gt; Now for the bug owners: Anyone one know if the
&gt; length of the shift rod
&gt; selector shaft (the rod that goes from the bottom of
&gt; the gear stick back to
&gt; the tranny) is the same length for a '66 as it is
&gt; for later bugs ('72), or is
&gt; the '66 a different length?
&gt;
