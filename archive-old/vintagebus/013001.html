Always wanted to learn to surf.

Stuff I have done with my bus includes:

Driving across the country to see relative, explore, and find bus parts.
Carry rocks to landscape my yard, including one trip where I carried 3400 pounds of rock at one time, measured on a certified scale.
Off roading in the deserts of Arizona.
Photographing.
Pulled some stumps once.
Pulling other buses around.
Going to swap meets with lots and lots of parts.
Pulled a bus apart at a junk yard once when the sawzall blades ran out... those spot welds are TOUGH.
Road Rallys.
Car shows... won quite a few trophies, despite the rust holes.
Posing for magazines.
Hauling friends to concerts and on road trips.
Camping.
Subject for photo project for school.
Learnin' about engines and welding and such.
Pulling big Cadil1acs out of ditches.
Race car (almost, until they told me there were too many things that might fall off my bus on the track... heck, if they didn't fall off at 85 MPH for an hour on the freeway they weren't going to fall off at 55 MPH for a 1/4 mile.)
Picking up girls, mostly unsuccessfully.  Well forget the mostly part.  Guess I need to learn to surf.

I'll add to the list if I think of anything.

Can't wait to hear everyone else's list.
Richard

I'm just wondering besides work on broken stuff what cool things do the list 
folk do with there Bus's.

For me theres nothing better than pulling up to the local surf break, pulling 
my longboard out of my Bus and hitting the beach.
The chicks be diggin me
