&gt; SOmeone questioned my estimate of tnhe date of the westybrochure page that
I created on http://members.xoom_dot_com/sglw/westybrochure
&gt;
&gt; I agree that the specification listed on page 8 shows an engine of 1679
vv. This learly applies o a 1972 bus.
&gt; Page 9 states a top &amp; ruising speed of 78 mph, also not a 69-70 bus.
&gt; But! when I look at the front wheel on page 10, it does not have the disc
brake wheels, also it has a painted hub cap for commercial vehicles.
&gt; What year is this?

Going by USA buses:
Square sidemarkers started in 70 [69 + 69 were round]
Round bumpers were 68 to 72.
Can't see tail lights....the long ones started in 72.
Has large-five hubcaps, last year was 70.
So....this is a 70....1st year of square sidemarkers and last year of
large-five wheels.
