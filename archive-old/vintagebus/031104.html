Yesterday was Monday, time warp!  ;)

Pomona to WI is ~2000 miles... a prep of any vehicle purchased would be
a good idea.

That Westy seemed like a good deal.

 Very good in my opinion!  If you'd of gone to Pomona yesterday you could
 have had a COMPLETE early westy (pre-65)with tent and privy for 4K!  Not
 cheep, but with tents like that pushing 1K all by themselves, the bus for
 3K seemed like an OK deal.  I'm not sure if it sold or if it'll be there
 on Sat., but here are a few pictures from Everett's site thanks to Greg.
