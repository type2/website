Find an original, the repo's are modified bay window ones and are a PITA to
make fit, spend the hours, that what it will take and be patient, that's
also what it takes.

ps; run the welder on the lowest possible heat range otherwise you will blow
through the repo part.

hi all, bought a small wire feed welder from sears, and I'm going to attempt

to replace the dogleg skin on my new bus.  However, the replacement panel 
seems kind of thin and flimsy.  Any advice on this would be just great!  
Thanks, Matt
