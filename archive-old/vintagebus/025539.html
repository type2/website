Yes I got my birthcertificate for my 65 delux bus. Didn't take long at
all. Took  about 2 weeks but I live in Germany also so it might take a
little longer for those in the states. For 10 marks I thought it was
well worth the info and something very cool to frame and hang on the
wall. You can get the address from Pim Van Loons bus site.www.ploon.nl
See you all at the Bad Camberg.
Bryan
