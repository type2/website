- [VB] Pickup Tilts - Webbing Straps
- Re: [VB] Busware truck canopys, pics posted / webbing colors

Before I got involved in campers I was heavily into commercial buses and drove
a single cab truck for six years. During that time I owned two OG tilt canvas
covers and eyeballed others. A friend, now restoring deluxes, had at one time
two NOS canvas covers. All had lightish or natural straps. The eye-hooks used
to retain the side flaps of Tom Buese's covers are more substantial than OG.
Original hooks were simply bent heavy gauge wire/light rod. Who knows what
color naugahyde VWAG used on a given day to back up the window/grommets. I
remember light tan ala &quot;leather&quot; tannish/neutral color. &lt;not sure&gt;

Regardless of the color of the straps or the clips, I salute the talent and
energy expended by Tom, PLF or whomever may be creating covers at any given
moment. For the $500 list price it looks to me that Tom's cover is a great
bargain. Combine the research, material, labor advertising/publicizing combined
plus the convenience of being able to obtain the thing via simple
phone/email/snailmail add up to a great win-win situation. 
It's great to have the products available. 
Note that the NOS OG canvas to which I refer sold in/around 1992-93(?) for $750
and $1000. in pre-eBay days. I sold a tilt about that time. The canvas (that
was shredded)from it soon resold separately for $400.

If you like the product buy it. If you can't use it then sidestep it. F the
vintage nazis as they dont exist or really care when it comes down to it if
they did. Put the bus in fourth gear and enjoy your life. =)
