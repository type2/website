Subject: Re: [VB] Delta alert

  I am at the Air Force base in Anchorage,It was 5am our time when this all 
started and I would have to say the F-15s were up in about 15 minutes 
patrolling our coastline .Of course we are under a pretty heavy lock down 
here also.It makes it kinda scary here considering we have the major oil 
pipelines running through alot of the state.We are down to FP CON charlie 
today but dont see it dropping below that for some time.

&gt;   My brother in law is in the Air Force stationed in Italy, he's the boss
&gt;man for his F 16 squadron ground crew. With in minutes of the WTC tragedy
&gt;he was called in to work under a Delta Alert, this is the next stage before
&gt;WAR.
&gt;   His wife has not heard from him since the Delta Alert. All of the base,
&gt;schools, hospitals, etc. are in LOCK-Down.
&gt;    During the GULF WAR his squadron was flying 24 hours a day,. The planes
&gt;would only land for refueling, new weapons and a fresh pilot. I'm sure the
&gt;situation is the same now. We don't have to worry, we are in very capable
&gt;hands with our servicemen overseas and they are READY. GOD bless them.
&gt;
