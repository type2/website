Info on the '53:    This is a &quot;known&quot; bus.  It has been to the Classic, 
Jerome Jamboree, RMMW show, Phoenix Bug-o-rama, and some others.  I bought it 
a few months ago because the price was right.  If you want an independent 
opinion of the bus I can give you some email addresses of folks who know the 
bus fairly well.  It is however, a MUCH improved bus since I bought it.  
Since purchasing it I have located several of the parts which were missing 
such as: 16&quot; rims, BD front seat, correct shifter (with an extension now 8-), 
BD front bumper, solid and straight BD rear apron, and more...and spent lot's 
hours cleaning it.  It was quite &quot;hygienically challenged&quot; when I got it.  
Also when I bought it, it wasn't running.  Since purchasing it a business 
deal I was involved with (and quit my job for) fell through so, my reasons 
for selling it are more financial and are not due to any problem(s) with the 
bus.    

The bus is a southwest bus and solid for the most part.  It has chips on the 
front end and some dings here and there but no major damage.  It does need an 
inner rocker on the passenger side and some repair in the rear of the front 
wheel well on that side due to rust.  There is a 50 cent piece size hole in 
the original battery tray.  There area few spots of pin holes in the dog legs 
but nothing severe.

Mechanicals: It has a 1600 DP engine in it and a later transaxle (and 
brakes).  It cruises on the highway at 60 - 65 without any problem.  The 
engine was rebuilt about 8 years ago and is of unknown mileage.  It runs well 
but I would anticipate an engine before a cross country trip.  There is a 
complete, drum to drum, Barndoor transaxle that comes with the bus if you 
want to take it back to stock all you will need is the engine.

Electricals:  Correct RIBBED semaphores work!  Everything is 6V with a newer 
6V Optima battery.

Missing parts:  Rear seat, front floor mat, Ebrake cables, and a few other 
miscellaneous parts.

Body: Paint is acceptable from 20 feet but is really an amateur job.  Really 
needs to be redone to be a &quot;looker.&quot;  The minimal rust need repaired as 
mentioned above.  Triangular braces behind front seat need replaced.

Upholstery is straight out of the 70's on the **BD six leg middle seat**.  
Yuck!  The correct BD front seat is gray and black vinyl.  Both are rip free 
but if you want something &quot;Nice&quot; you'll need to redo them both.

If you have seen the bus and looked at it reasonably close and feel I have 
misrepresented it in anyway please post corrections.  

I will be putting this on Ebay Thursday night.
