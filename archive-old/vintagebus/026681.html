Subject: nose and bumper challenge

Hi all-
I am getting close to doing the body work on my 66.  The body is nearly
stripped of components, etc.  This is my first attempt at body work.  I
am hoping to get a decent look, without spending a ton of dough.  A
special thanks to Rex Rogers (the type2guy) for his help in this area.

My question is regarding the nose and front bumper.  Rex suggested
&quot;asking the list.&quot;  So here goes...

When I went to remove the front bumper and brackets, I could not help
but notice that the bumper was pushed in within millimeters of the nose
skin.  But I did not notice obvious frame or bracket damage underneath
upon removal.  (Although I do not have a restored bus to measure and
compare with).  I did notice, however, a small buckle in the floor board
on the passenger side.

What should I do???  After pounding out the nose, and applying the
filler, I do not want to attach the the repro or redone bumper and have
it look as before, or possibly not fit.  But I do not want to spend too
much to get it entirely redone....  I saw Thom's idea about pushing it
out with the scissor jacks, but if I attempt this, how far do I go???

Any ideas???

Thanks in advance.
Mark
