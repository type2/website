This could indirectly qualify as a Bus topic:

My web site, VW Planet, is down.

I made a request for increased resources to be allocated to
my web site.  They took a look at the site and decided I
was subhosting* and promptly cancelled my account.  Perhaps
our societal redefinition of the word &quot;free&quot; confused them.
 Anyway, notifying me beforehand was not an option, which
is in line with their policy of &quot;Superior Customer
Service&quot;.  ;(

I expect it to be back up later today, after I rip them a
new one.

Big business sucks,

*subhosting = selling web space to others without cutting
them in on the take.
