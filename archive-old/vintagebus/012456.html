I was noticing that the backs of my 16&quot; rims are painted black.  Is
this correct?  Correct for commercial vehicles only?  I think someone
mentioned this was correct to me a while back.

Did it continue on to the 15&quot; wheels?

Did rims ever come color-matched from the factory, i.e. Dove Blue?
