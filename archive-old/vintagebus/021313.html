A few years ago I bought 2 copies of that record for $15 each at a record 
store here in Ann Arbor and then I saw another copy for sale at the annual 
New York record fair.  The guy was asking $25 on that one.  I don't think 
they are as rare as you might think.  Or maybe I just got lucky.  

Later,

PS. If anyone is looking for a copy of this record, let me know because I'm 
planning on going to the next New York record fair in November and I could 
keep my eyes open for it.
