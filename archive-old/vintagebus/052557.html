Subject: bus front suspension question/problem

Hi everyone,
Has anyone heard of front torsion bars going bad. For some reason the front 
of my 63 deluxe rides extremeley rough. Like a 1-ton truck. ok, maybe not 
that bad.
Could it possibly be the torsion leaves have gone bad or maybe the king pin 
needle bearings need replacing.
Does anyone know of a way to test a front suspension?
Yesterday I picked up a drum to drum front beam out of a wrecked 62 single 
cab. It's complete but was lowered by pulling torsion leaves. Now I'm stuck 
with re-using my existing torsion leaves which I hadn't planned to. 
Anyone have any suggestions or spare torsion bars they would like to sell.

Thanks in advance,
Dave Barnes
