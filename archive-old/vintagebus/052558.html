Subject: [VB] Re: What is sealing wax red?

The smart a** in me wants to reply, &quot;It's an over used, cliche' color&quot;.

The more mature side of me wishes to encourage folks to go do a web-search or
even go to an old-school analog library and research color theory.
Specifically, I mention the effect of any given color when placed next to
another (or not). Secondly, remember how the perception of any color &quot;changes&quot;
from a 2 inch by 2 inch sample (on cardboard) vs. being applied onto an entire
large surface, ie a (metal with primer on it) bus.
Compare anyone's mixture of SWR out of the same hypothetical can of paint and
apply it onto a panel bus and a beetle of whatever year you imagine.
Compare a 100% velvet green camper to a hypothetically over touted green and
white one. The Velvet Grn will/may &quot;look&quot; differently between the two vehicles.
Suppose that the first two-toned bus had the green/white paint sprayed directly
onto primer. Then paint L82 Pearl above the belt line onto the previously 100%
green bus. The pearl of the second bus may be affected by the underlying green
vs. the grey primer of the first bus. Yeah OK who cares about Velvet and white
in this discussion. I was only making a point. Sealing wax red next to white
will look different to SWR next to any attempt at Chestnut brown.
Add polished aluminum, brown upholstery, white steering whls and fat white
walls and insert trim- and the perception will also be different.

Take a breath and then get into Additive and Subtractive color theory, printed,
projected, wet vs dry of the same mixture. Two coats the exact mixture of pearl
white paint on one panel and not on another of the same vehicle? Perception
change? You betcha! Print it in a magazine or display it in a movie/TV show and
get it exactly right? Forget it! That is a rough representation and can be
messed up in a thousand ways.  

If you aren't bored out of your skull yet, then imagine the effects of the same
exact mixture of automotive paint from brand to brand. I'd guess that you will
have a subtle shift. Single stage vs. the same color under the second stage of
clear? Dull vs shiny? Perception change? Perhaps.

Warm vs. Cool- Tint vs. Shade: Don't even mention the blue based (cool) red of
the late 60's bays that had an RCH of black in it vs. the warm yellow based
Porsche Guards (Gaards) red. Major difference!

I recently had the opportunity to see a bus in a tippy top secret locale that
had OG factory Sealing Wax Red on the area above the visors, where the mohair
deluxe headliner (with all kinds of holes in it) used to be and up into the
fresh air duct work. To me it appeared more Coral, damned near pink with a
teeny skosh of orange and black spooged into it. To the person that I was with
it seemed gray. He's color blind. The color was similar to the rubbed out OG
deluxe that Mark L. brought to the Summer OCTO a few years ago, not the overly
glossy nasty yellow-red waving at ya sack of walnuts looking Tijuana
bondo-mobile imitation deluxe knock-off that was at Pomona later that same
season. 

Sealing wax? How many young folks have even SEEN sealing wax and know what it
was used for? On this list I am amazed that no one has started calling the chit
&quot;Ceiling Wax&quot; red. Place the Coral next to the imaginary perfectly formulated
Chestnut (with the exact amount of black in it) and the SWR of your dreams will
look different once again. Even the row of nicely done deluxe Barndoors at the
OCTO several years ago were somewhat different.

God Bless the talented and proud who have-presently are-and are planning to mix
the Mothers Milk and attempt to please everyone. Pfft, Please! 

Being serious for a second, I salute the folks who have done incredible work
combining the SWR and CB and sharing them with us at places like the Duck Pond.
Time, sweat, love-hate, talent and finances involved orchestrated into a
cohesive result is the real trick. Sitting behind a keyboard and being blowhard
provocateur is the easy part. Bottom line? Use Michael Hornbecker's OG deluxe
as a benchmark if you are ever lucky enough to see it.
