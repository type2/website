Subject: 1700 engine and other misc parts - Free in tampa

Hi all,
  I am moving in a few weeks and need to get rid of some stuff.  I will ship some of the items if you're interested but will charge what's listed below to cover shipping. 
 
  (1) W case 1700 shortblock (type4)  - No cylinders or heads, does roll over, has fan shroud, alt., pistons - This is from a 914 but is the same as some early bay buses. Good core or parts
               FREE - But you must pick it up
 
  (2) Sets of heat exchangers - Used but still have some decent life left.  I hate to scrap them if someone can use them  - $25 per set  ( free if you  pickup)
 
  (1) Beetle muffler - good used (from a 1500)   $20 shipped - FREE if you pickup 
 
If anyone is interested in building an Oxyboxer let me know, I have a complete waterboxer 1.9L.  It had 72K when the heads started leaking coolant.  It is disassembled and ready to start machining.  $125 shipped
 
E-mail me if you're interested.  
 
Thanks,
Matt
