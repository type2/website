I've had this problem back in the deep past. I believe it was a fuel
problem, specifically the float valve in the carb. Or possibly the fuel
pump.

&gt; Hi Matt,
&gt; Whoops!  Got rushed sending out last email.  It could be either or both you
&gt; pilot (Idle) or main jets are too big.  Also could be you fuel pump is putting
&gt; out too much pressure due to too high or long of push rod, or the fuel shut
&gt; off or the float in the carb is bad.  So check fuel pressure, and possibly
&gt; replace the fuel shut off valve and float.
