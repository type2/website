Subject: Mexico report complete on web

Dear Listees of all flovors,

I finally got the rest of the Mexico story up on the web page, along
with more pictures. It is the one that has appeared in the last 6 issues
of NEATO's Old Bus Review &quot;8013 miles in a 65 kombi&quot;. 

go to http://www.clubvw.corvallis.or_dot_us 

and then either follow the link on the sidebar called &quot;mexican odyssey&quot;
or scroll down to trips reports: Mexico and go from there. You will get
to a page with three options, the first half of the report, the second
half, and a third section with pics on getting the bus ready to go,
including shots of the interior custom/westy hybrid and a lot more
blather from yours truly. 

I had a list of folks I was supposed to notify when I finally got this
last part up, but have long since deleted it, so pass the word to anyone
who cares. 

PS who is the new vintagebus list admin? Shirley?
