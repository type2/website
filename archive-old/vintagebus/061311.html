I can confirm this, as that's what I did in DARTHVW, I
put in the Wolfsburg West lap belts.
There are no shoulder belt anchors, though. If you
want shoulder belts back there you have to have metal
welded into the posts, and tapped (dyed?)

Had a section on how they did it, under the '59 23
window restoration pages.

Good luck
