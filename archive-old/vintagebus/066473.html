Subject: re:6V batteries

this same thing happened to me, but i didn't think to check it until i had
installed it. it was dead, so i had to uninstall, wrench it out, and bring
it back.

was writ:
&quot;I bought a new 6 V battery three months ago from the local Interstate
distributor.  They sell a &quot;Group 2&quot; 6 V battery that is bigger and
closer to the original VW spec than the 6 V batteries I see at the auto
parts stores.

When I bought the new battery I went out to install it in the parking
lot.  Something told me to test it out before I lifted it up into the
Bus.  I put my voltmeter on it and it was 4.something volts.&quot;
