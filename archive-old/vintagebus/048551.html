Subject: Camping &amp; Propane Heaters

I just got back from the VW Fest close to Herman, MO and I must say that
Rick and the Mossuri Micros did a wonderful job on the campout.  That
campout will be on my calender for next year!  Beautiful campground, fun
caravan to Herman (they had 1/3 off on cases of wine at one of the
wineries) and Rick really went out of his way to get some great raffle
prizes.  Even though the chili cookoff was a bit wet, (that's an under
statement, it poured!!) the event was a lot of fun.  Hat's off to Rick.

But about the propane heaters, I remember as a kid, when I would stay at
grandma's house in the winter, she had these small room heaters that were
natural gas and would burn over a ceramic face.  This is the same way the
propane heaters such as the Little Buddy work http://www.mrheater_dot_com/

I had heard that it might be getting a little cold for the campout, so I
bought one of these.  It looks just like grandma's, but smaller.  People
have used these heaters for years in their houses.  But I did buy a CO
detector that plugs into the wall in the house, or runs on batteries in the
bus (I have been meaning to get one for the house anyway).  Didn't get a
chance to try the heater, the temperature was very nice for sleeping.  I
found the heater at Tractor Supply.  I doubt many of you outside the
midwest have these stores, shame, 'cause these stores have EVER THIN!!

And if you want to try out your new heater, don't forget the Bustober Fest
at Indian Cave State park in SE Nebraska next weekend (Octorber 27, 28, 29)
