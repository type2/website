 &gt; hm, interesting- I haven't noticed any flattening.  Did you use a longish 
 &gt; 2x4 to spread the weight?
 
 Hi Clara,
 We used and still use a 4x4 laid lengthwise front to rear in relation to the 
 bus on top of the small floor jack to get just enough hieght to raise the 
bus 
 wheels off the ground.

AH-ha I use the piece of wood 90* off from the direction of the bus.  This 
way the weight of the bus spreads more than 4&quot;.

Well,  There is more than one way to do it.  Mine works for me.
