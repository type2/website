Hello, Knowledgeable Ones!

I must admit...I am a little confused.  Today, yet another VW person
responded to my using the term &quot;Sea Blue&quot; with &quot;...oh, the bug color?&quot;  And
I must admit, after looking through the vintagebus_dot_com registry, that the
color swatches next to the many buses that had Sea Blue as part of their
makeup looked nothing like what I am calling Sea Blue....nor did the color
of the sample in a recent VW mag....

I have never seen a bus with this color!  And I find it strange that no-one
on the list seems to have a digital photo or the location (URL) of a pic
with such a bus.  SO.  I ask you if you would be so kind as to check out the
one pic at the following address....is the bug (which I miss very much) Sea
Blue or not?  If not, well, what is it?

BTW....that bus in the background was where I slept for a couple weeks....it
was haunted! I saw the former owner a month ago....he gave up on it a long
time ago.  Shame.   And those goofballs were rockin to the mellow strains of
Metallica's &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;.

The guy at the paint shop where I ordered 3 quarts of a match to the radio
blockoff plate  (Pearl White) (oh, and it wasn't faded or oxidized) told me
that it would be better to go with a base/clear coat system as it is harder
to screw that up.  But the one of the colors I wanted could not be made in
base/clear, so he said I'd have to go with single-stage, which is harder.
Why is it harder, and are there any pieces of info that I can let my mind
chew on while I'm prepping?  How can I avoid screwing this up?

TIA

Gene
