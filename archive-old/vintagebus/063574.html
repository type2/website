Hi David,
Those were made in the USA the gray plastic ones were aftermarket while the 
chrome ones were made for VOA .  Do you have images of them?  We bought a 
grey set from JP a while ago and Barb really needs them to keep cool in our 
1960 panel camper conversion.  If you are not going to use them we would like 
to buy them for our 1963 SC.
