Subject: Re: [T2] How do I get my parts from Germany?

Look up freight forwarders or freight consolidators (don_at_t 
trust my spelling but you get the jist). They are PERFECT 
for shipping heavy or bulky items long distances. The one I 
use and recomend regulalry within North America is 
www.forwardair_dot_com . I once shipped a pool tabble I sold on 
ebay. Fedex wanted $700 forwardair wanted $70 ... its not 
hard math.

Thanks,
Chris

&gt;
&gt;    Greetings all.
&gt;
&gt;I have a question regarding shipment of parts.  I have 
purchased a trailer
&gt;hitch from an individual in Germany.  The hitch is too 
large for the post
&gt;office to handle.  I have suggested FedEx and UPS.  I 
haven't got any more
&gt;ideas.
&gt;
&gt;How can I get it from there to here?  Any suggestions?
&gt;
&gt;Has anyone ever had something that large shipped?
&gt;
&gt;Please let me know.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;Victor
