Hmmm,

ALL belly pan buses that I've seen (sunroof and 
double door models) have the third outrigger
(and the pan extending to them...) regardless of year?

All buses to about 59 have the third outrigger 
regardless of whether they are belly pan models
or not?

&gt; The early pans are longer and extend to the third set of outriggers I
believe.

&gt; I've never seen a set of barn or 'early' belly pans intact
&gt; 
&gt; on a bus.
