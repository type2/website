Hi Volks,

Steven Howell wrote to the List:
&gt; #1 cylinder isn't firing, 2 thru 4 are.
&gt; Lift the high tension lead out of the dizzy tower for #1, about 1/4&quot; above
&gt; it, and then the sparks jump from the lead down into the dizzy tower
&gt; opening for #1 and the cylinder picks up and the motor purrs.

Hmmm... while I'm not a serious VW mechanic by any stretch
of the imagination, I'm an avid reader of classic car mags.
In the latest issue of Motor Klassik, the exact same
symptoms are described in a question.  They suggested it
might be not a problem with the ignition system at all, but
with the carb or valves, resulting in a mixture that isn't
as easy to ignite as it should be.  When you lift the lead
out of the dizzy, you create a stronger spark which then
is able to ignite this less-ignitable mixture.

I don't know if any of the above is correct or applicable
to your problem, I just thought I'd share it.  Let me
know if that was it.

Airhowlingly yours,
    Erik.
