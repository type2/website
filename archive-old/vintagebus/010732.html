Hello all. Well I just got back from the event and it was great. This
isa can't miss deal. I had a chance to meet some really great people and
saw some awesome buses.  There will be somee pics up here sometime as
Erin and Terry were the official camera crew. Mighty fine work too. I
can't wait to see them and I just left!  A big Thank You to Erin for all
the help with my bus and all the good info. I can't say enough about how
everything went off. It really is nice to be able to put a face with
some of the people I've had a chance to meet through th list. There
wasn't one bad apple in the batch. Great people, Great buses, Great
time!  Well more later I've gotta clean out my bus and get cleaned up.
See Ya
