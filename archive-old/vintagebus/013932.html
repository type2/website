Apples an oranges.  Being a year older doesn't necessarily have any
historic or temporal significance because there isn't a time constraint
on either side.  Missing a train by 1 minute, or missing the x-files season 
opener by one hour, that's significance, because they occur occur at a
specific point in time, and you're either there or you're not.

If my bus had been born a month earlier (march instead of april) then
it might have been a barndoor.  This is significant because being a
barndoor is significant.  In another case, the difference between
a september of 57 and october of 57 would probably have no significance
only because we haven't identified anything significant historically
about that time period.

&gt; That's ridiculous.   
&gt; 
&gt; I missed being a year older by a year.
