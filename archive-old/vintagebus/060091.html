Subject: Re: [T2] to the hot wax goddess

OK, I wasn't going to share this tale of woe, but your success compels me
; ). Caution, not for faint of heart. The frankenmotor for my '68 was almost
done,new p&amp;c's, heads rebuilt, had just finished setting the valves and was
looking forward to quickly finishing off the rest. All that remained was to
change out one too short exhaust stud. Not a problem I thought, the rest
came out with heat and wax real easy. Heated it up,added wax, attached stud
puller, added light pressure, snap, *&amp;%$_at_. Enough stud left to pull with
vice grips. re-heated, re-waxed, set vice-grip, snap, now broken flush with
head. Double *&amp;%_at_. Put tools away.

New day. Drilled pilot hole for ez out, bit snapped. Went one size up,
continued to drill pilot hole, added heat and wax again, insert and bed ez
out, add light pressure, snap. Refrain from throwing tools and having temper
tantrum. Spend next 30 min with pick pulling out broken ez out. Call dad who
brings over left hand pullers. Add more heat and wax. Realize its stuck too
hard for puller (scared to break another). Decide to drill it out instead,
drill it out undersize and go to retap it. Tap breaks. Figure no way to pull
it out so I'll tap it with a punch and break it up. Exhaust tab breaks off.
Quietly put tools away thinking 25 years has taught me nothing.

Epilogue. After walking around it for a couple of weeks hoping it'll go
away, I break down and pull the head off and take it to be welded up. Cost
$10 cdn and a few minutes o jaw boneing. Take it home and jig it up on the
drill bench, hole bores true and like butter. Run new tap thru and new stud
also threads in like butter.

Moral? just when you start to think you know a thing or two, the Vdub gods
take a bite outa your ego. Sumtimes you get the bear-sumtimes the bear gets
you. So if your new to buses, dont sweat it, it happens to us all.

Subject: [T2] to the hot wax goddess


&gt;   I heated it with the sacred torch and applied the
&gt; special Amazonian-carnuba/killer-bee wax blend while chanting various
&gt; incantations to the wax goddess and casting some rose petals.
&gt;  she eased right out. More rose petals and a big sigh of relief.
