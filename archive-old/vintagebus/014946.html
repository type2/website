Hey Jim,

&gt; Hey man! the fnt bumper on the cover of July '55
&gt; Popular Mechanics looks chromed...

Yes, chromed bumpers are correct on the barndoor
westfalias...I have factory photos and lit showing
this! Guess it was their way of snazzing the campers 
up?   So, Yup that is correct...I have to say this bus
is messed up but all the westy stuff is correct and
unmolested.

&gt; &quot;Oldest Camper&quot; in the US huh?
&gt; Um, what month of '54? If we are talking barndoor
&gt; era
&gt; buses that technically also happens to be currently
&gt; in
&gt; a camper config then... (Heh-heh) Is it in perfect
&gt; running order? Is the paint beyond nice? Does it
&gt; have....
&gt; Naw, On second thought I'll stay out of this one.
;-)

Yea...but this `54 is an &quot;actual&quot; Westfalia
barndoor...ha ha!!  Sorry Jim you stepped into that
one! ;-)

I have a couple half assed pics off this one too when
it was at Dave (world reknowned kubel and schwimm
guru) Crompton's in Michigan if folks wanna see, pics
are really bad but you can see it is real.  It is the
identical westfalia camp outfit as seen in Popular
Mechanics July `55.  Definitely a neat bus...worth
$15k ??? maybe...and the oldest...NAAA second...but
from what I hear Westfalia themselves don'e even own
an &quot;actual&quot; original barndoor westy...they have a `51
or `52 in the museum but it is a fake or reproduction
interior made to original specs and plans...neat but
not the real Mcoy.

Tds
