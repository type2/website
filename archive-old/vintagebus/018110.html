&gt; YOUR_BUS though, is entirely up to you. . .

I guess I can agree. I worked with a ravenous comic
book collector for a while, and I told him that if I
ever won the lottery, I'd go to the Comic Con and buy
the sealed Superman #1, then proceed to open it right
there, read it, the roll it up then stick it in the
back pocket of the 501s and stroll through the rest of
the show, just to cheese people off.

I love restored busses, I just spent 90 minutes
&quot;GOOF-OFF&quot;-ing the black Maaco pint off my dash (DPPO)
but the bizarre busses are still busses; those guys
have a right I guess. I was at OCTO and I saw a lot of
cherry busses and in the back next to DARTHVW there
were plenty of rusties. Good to know at least they're
out of the weeds, wether on their way to West Coast
Classics, or to some place called SWEET RIDES R-US. 

If you want a philosophical lesson in bus use, rent
TOY STORY 2. We just saw it and that movie is awesome.
