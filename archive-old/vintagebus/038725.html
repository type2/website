Subject: friday topic - new bumper sticker.

after browsing through the &quot;Hall-o-Shame&quot; on Thom's site and seeing all the
disasterous accidents i thought of a new bumper sticker. it would say &quot;Start
Seeing Buses&quot; with a picture of a bus on the left. it would be a play off of
the &quot;Start Seeing Motorcycles&quot; stickers that i'm sure some of you have. we
could put them on our daily drivers and maybe make them in a green color or
something to seperate them from the motorcyle ones. I remember someone had
access to a printing press. i could design them if i could get the vector
image of the bus drawing on type2_dot_com and send the file to whoever wants to
take on the task of printing them. what do you kids think?
