&gt; &gt; Well, the stars must have lined up wrong or something; I actually have
&gt; &gt; *3* dates this weekend.  At this rate, the '54 will never get done...
&gt; &gt; I wonder if I could get any of them to pose with the bus; the '60 DD
&gt; &gt; will be the date-mobile as the 911 is funked up with a fuel injection
&gt; issue.
&gt; &gt; It pays to have at least one presentable VW!

She wouldnt have fit in the 911 anyway. Thank Pon for cargo doors.
