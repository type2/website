. The
&gt; day was topped off by my bride backing the '63 into
&gt; the wall of the house while backing out. Logic must
&gt; have been &quot;If it was pulled straight into the
&gt; driveway, then cranking the f outta the wheel must be
&gt; the way to back it out.&quot; My only response was to the
&gt; tune of &quot;That's alright, dear- at least you weren't
&gt; hurt.&quot; What's another Glasurit paintjob anyway...
&gt; (Grrrrrr!)

Hell, Jim, you should be dancing in the streets. She wasn't driving HER bus!

Live fast, die young, leave a good looking corpse.
