I think your bug/bus theory may have some merit.  Sea Blue was used on bugs
and Ghias from '60-'66 only.

&gt;I looked in my old  1967 Ditzler paint chip book today
&gt;
&gt;there are Two  L360 Sea Blue paints
&gt;
&gt;the darker one is 12333 Sea Blue    1960-66
&gt;the lighter one is 12945 Sea Blue #2   63-67
&gt;
&gt;both are L360
&gt;
&gt;I am not sure if one was for a bug/ghia and the other for buses or ???
&gt;
&gt;looked at a 21 window today  and it still had the tags on it
&gt;L360 Sea Blue
&gt;L680 Cumulus white
&gt;
&gt;I hope all this adds to the confusion , because other then taking a original 
&gt;part off the car I am not sure which is the right color ?????
