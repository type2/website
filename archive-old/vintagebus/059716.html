Hey all.  Thought I might share a funny thing that could have been bad.=20

I started my bus up this afternoon and ran inside to grab something =
letting her idle a bit.  When I came back out.........my bus was GONE!  =
stolen?.......nope.  Seems that I need to pay a little attention to my =
Ebrake.  Luckily for me a nice rhododendron stopped her across the =
street, but it could have been bad seeing that I live at the way top of =
a steep hill.  Luckily she got away with only a tiny scratch, and a bush =
limb stuck under her.

Tomorrow will be Ebrake repair day.
