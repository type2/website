Subject: Tents, Awnings, and Holiday Schedule

A couple of quick notes...

1) The $199 side tents and $69 awnings are at Customs in New York and
shortly to be in my hands. There will be enough to fill all orders plus a
bit to spare. (Links to pics/info at
http://www.busdepot_dot_com/ASP/SearchProdDesc.cfm?ProdDesc=tent+OR+awning if
you didn't get your order in yet.) They were supposed to be in my hands by
now, but Customs has been moving at a snails pace since Sept. 11, and now
we're near a legal holiday (at which time they move extra slowly).  So I'm
dashing all hopes for this week and looking toward early next week (barring
anything unforseen).   I'll have 'em out to you within a day or two of when
they arrive.

2)  We'll be closed tomorrow for Independence Day, but open on Friday the
5th during our usual hours (11-7 E.D.T.).  Email sent to sales_at_busdepot_dot_com
will be answered (as time allows) by Cheri on Friday.  Email sent to me
personally, however, will not be, as I'll be at the Great Blue Heron Music
Festival (near Jamestown, NY) until Monday.  Incidentally, can I hope to see
any of you there? I highly recommend it for people of all ages - camping
along a swimming lake, music of all kinds, dance, crafts, kids activities,
the most legal fun you can have.  The festival starts on Friday morning, and
you can buy a daily or weekend pass. The nearby town of Mayville has a nice
fireworks dsiplay over the lake the night before (the 4th).  My family
drives about 7 hours to this festival every year and it's worth it. See
www.greatblueheron_dot_com .  If you go, look for a small circle of Westies with
side tents attached, and stop by for a cold beer!

Happy 4th!!!
