&gt; Hi list
&gt;
&gt; So I rigged up a voltage drop for my windshield wipers and ..... the move
&gt; very slowly - I'm happy with them though because the wiper motor is now
&gt; very, very quite.  When it was running on 12 volt the blades moved really
&gt; fast but the motor howled like a banshee ....
&gt;
&gt; I do ramble! Anyway, I'm wondering about a 6 volt radio.  If I installed it
&gt; with a voltage drop should it work perfectly?  My guess is yes but ..... the
&gt; list knows all.

Don't use resistor voltage drop devices for radios.  PERIOD.

It will cause the voltage to vary as the volume goes up and down.  You may get
away with it but the performance will be subpar and you run the risk of it being
too small resistance and frying your radio.

Get a voltage regulator type device that will regulate the voltage right at 6
volts.
An LM317 in a TO-3 can is good for 3 amps.  Most of the old 6V radios are draw
less than 1 amp.

There are a number of web pages around with the circuit on it if you want to run
to your local electronic parts house and gather up the stuff and DIY.  Sorry,
don't have a link off the top of my head.
