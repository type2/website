&gt; p.s. to ron, i have noticed you are always hiring it seems, high turnover
&gt; at a job usually indicates too low of pay or difficult working
&gt; conditions.

High turnover isn't the problem at all - it's rapid expansion.  I'm not
replacing people (other than summer help who go back to school), I'm adding
people.  But it is extremely hard to find good help, especially in our rural
neck of the woods (about an hour from the nearest city).  We have resolved
some of that by having our email and website business handled off-site in
suburban Boston (when you're handling email it doesn't really matter where
you are), but obviously not everything can be handled by remote.  I can't
complain too loudly because many businesses would love to have the problem
of being _too_ busy.  But I have to admit that it is a sad but true fact
that rapid expansion can cause customer service to suffer sometimes.  We
have been doing our best, adding as many people as we can, working over
lunch, etc.  You would not believe the frantic pace here unless you saw it
first-hand.  You start moving full-speed as soon as you walk in the door,
eat lunch with one hand while answering calls with the other, and by the end
of the day you drag your sorry ass into your car and go home to collapse.
At this point we are actually looking forward to the slower winter season
when we can catch our breath, organize things a bit, and try to start
working proactively again rather than just trying to keep up with the
demand.

&gt; I am sure i will buy from busdepot again, their prices are quite
&gt; good.  But i will have to be careful to order by VW part number only... as
&gt; that should reduce the errors. In the past i had expected the order takers
&gt; to have even a rudimentary knowledge of vw's, which proved not to be the
&gt; case.

When you dial the toll-free number (1-866-BUS-DEPOT), you will get someone
who is qualified to do absolutely nothing but take your order by part
number.  Those operators have absolutely zero knowledge of VW parts. They
cannot answer the simplest parts question or access customer-service
records. This is one way that we've tried to alleviate the frenetic pace
here - by routing calls from people who know exactly what they want, to
operators who are only trained to handle those calls. Put differently, it is
cheaper and easier for me to pay your long-distance bill, then it is for me
to find and pay someone to look up parts for you.  So it's worth it to me to
pay your toll call if you will do the parts lookups yourself - and this I
can do without raising prices, since my increased phone bill (which is huge)
is offset by the payroll savings.  On the other hand, if you do need to
speak to someone who can answer parts questions, look up existing orders, or
answer other customer service related questions, 215-234-VWVW or
sales_at_busdepot_dot_com gets you more experienced employees who can help you with
those questions.  As a rule, my employees start off handling the toll-free
line, or boxing orders, and then work their way up to handling the customer
service line if/when their experience and abilities warrant it.

We're not perfect, but we do try hard.  As I said before, I'm always
interested in hearing customer feedback, so please pmail me at
busdepot_at_email_dot_com (this reaches me directly) if you have any problems.
