Does anyone have a radio blank? Just can't find one in Australia, probably
due to lack of T2s!
I'm a generous person, and willing to pay for the stamps too! - if you've
got on, let me know where and I'll work out the postage.

and if you know anyone that sells repro Bud Vases, let me know, I'd like to
ship some in too!
