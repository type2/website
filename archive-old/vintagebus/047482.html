getting parts from Brazil was never easy.....

all the suppliers have problems with their orders and getting them shipped. 

VW Brazil is like VW Germany and does not really care abvout the old car 
market.
they make their money on building new cars , 
this is going to get worse soon as VW is moving some of their Mexican 
production to Brazil, the &quot;suitcase&quot; bus is now built in Brazil and soon the 
Golf + Jetta, 

the VW official factory will be very busy..........

then you will have to deaL with the suppliers that do not have a contract 
with VW for parts on these new cars, 
which will probably mean 2nd + 3rd string companies for the small run parts 
it just not worth it to set up to run 100-500-1000 parts when they are 
supplying new parts for new cars........

big companies like Varta , Cima etc that sell to the whole VW market will 
hopefully keep supplying aircooled parts.......
