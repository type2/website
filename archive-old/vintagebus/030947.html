&gt; * A 5th gear/higher speeds?  Use the Berg setup or a freeway flier.

Just to clear the air, the above sentence annoys the hell out of me. A Berg 5 will
not get you a true 5th gear, but another gear ratio somewhere between 2nd and 3rd.
The final drive of a Berg 5 in 5th is the same as a stock tranny in forth. My
reason for wanting to do a 5 speed tranny is basically to see what I can do. I've
done straight axle kits, IRS trans kits, late IRS trannies into Swing axle with
reduction boxes, Berg 5's into Bugs &amp; T III's, etc. What I have never done is a
true 5 speed conversion. If I am going to do this I want a *true* 5th gear not an
extra one between 2nd and 3rd.
