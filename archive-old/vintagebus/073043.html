Subject: RE: gland nut questions/airs help

Yeah that is the type of gland nut he had used-it had a bigger head(1 7/8&quot;)
but it was thinner, which made getting a socket on it a bit more
difficult...but we got it off. I don't know if I understand the performance
advantage? Maybe it distributes the torque better?

Later editions of the Idiot manual (mine is the &quot;25th anniverstary
edition, printed February 1996) have a &quot;Hi-Performance Modifications&quot;
chapter.  In it, it says &quot;Some aftermarket gland nuts have heads that
are so big they interfere with clutch operation.  Better quality nuts
have thinner heads but retain their strength.&quot;  I'm not sure whether
the &quot;bigness&quot; means thickness of the bolt head, or the wrench size it
takes.  According to both Muir and Wilson (How to Rebuild...), the
stock wrench size is 36 mm or 1 7/16&quot;.
