That's an easy one...

I carry an inexpensive set of rain gear - separate jacket and pants [pants
have an elastic waist - no suspenders to mess with].  Cheaper than
coveralls, does double duty, easy to pull on over regular clothes, stores in
very little space.

Since my bus is a Westy I automatically carry several cheap blue tarps of
various sizes.  I just use whatever tarp matches the situation, depending on
its folded size.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  Scott brought up a good one.
  How many of us carry work clothes and a work mat in our buses, or do we
all believe that our buses don't break and don't need them?  &lt;&lt;
