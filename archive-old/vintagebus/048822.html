Subject: got my end play set

Under the advice of Ronnie from http://www.oldvolks_dot_com I went ahead 
and took the 1600cc motor I'm assembling to the local shop to get the 
endplay set. I offered Raul the owner today's beer money in exchange 
for setting it for me. So after I got him a 12-pack of Coors light, 
and me a nice mini-barrel of Foster's, he was more than happy to set 
it for me.

Got it set at a nice .004. I got to see what I need to do it right, 
and how to do it right. &quot;monkey see, monkey do&quot;. He also loaned me 
his ring compressor to make my installation of the P's &amp; C's easier. 
Gave me some tips there as well. He complimented the work so far. 
Said it was REALLY smooth and everything was looking good. I took the 
oppurtunity to ask if he was having any computer problems. It turns 
out he was, and he needed help 'cause  he &quot;doesn't know a damn thing 
about computers&quot;. So we talked a bit and I'm gonna hook him up in 
that area. Great to keep getting on more better terms with the only 
guy in town.

So now I'm out of my lame slump and will continue on putting it 
together the engine for my bus. I HAVE been working on the interior a 
little, as well as doing some work on my wife's 'vert. So I'm not 
totally slacking :)
