&lt;&lt; Hi,

The numerals  10 9 reside at the top of the tag.     I guess
it was built on September 9. Is that correct?

..10th day of the 9th month is...   10th September

I have the  big hatch, whew. Also the engine lid had the
articulating/locking arm until some big galoot at a service
station crushed the lid closed one time. Don't know about any spring.

sounds like an early 64 model- buildt in late 63.  
FWIW they switched the doors to the push button when they switched to the roller spring engine lid prop- the pull handle door buses came with the elbow prop that get smooshed when you push the engine lid down w/o releasing the engine lid.  So this bus would have come with the pull handle doors- not the push buttons.

 I believe the chassis number is 1164691. Found that on the plate in the engine compartment. Also found
