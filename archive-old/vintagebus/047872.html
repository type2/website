&lt;&lt; Why the change from '66 and earlier then??? &gt;&gt;
Hi Steve,
Okay if gasolene vaporizes in a pre-1967 tank while full up into the neck of 
the tank the fuel that is still liquid is pushed up the neck and out of the 
gas cap.  With the 1967 VW attempted to reduce this pressurization and fuel 
leakage due to this by adding a hump that allowed for more  room for the fuel 
vapor.  Kind of the same reason it takes less time to pump up a wheel barrow 
tire than compared to VW sized tires.
In post-1967 buses VW added to this hump an outlet tube that was connected to 
a set of vapor condensors on the inside of the engine air inlets, and also to 
a charcoal canistor that held fuel vapor formed while the VW was parked.  
This charcoal canister upon starting the engine to have the fuel vapor inside 
it both pumped by a hose from the air outlet tube on the right side of the 
doghouse fan shroud and sucked out another hose into the air cleaner to be 
burned in the engine.
Both systems were designed so as to reduce air pollution caused by cars just 
releasing raw gasolene vapors into the atmosphere while sitting parked.
