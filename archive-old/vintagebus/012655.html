I'm heading down Fri Morning along 95 and then 85 to rt 40 to go to
Everybus; the first trip with Westy over 200K on same engine...and for
insurance would like to know where there may be VW-repair friendly places
within 100 mi of that corridor?  (Good Sam will allow towing of an RV to
400 mi to place that can service it!)  While I have 135 lbs compression all
around, #1 cyl did not go to 165 with a wet compression test, so I'm
concerned about a &quot;small&quot; leak that could be a seat.   So any places I know
about that the Westy could be towed to (or limped to) would be helpful...or
even listees along way not going to Everybus.   Thanks!
