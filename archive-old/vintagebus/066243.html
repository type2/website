Subject: Starter Life Span and Carb Problem Update

After going through everything removing the starter, learning that to test a 
starter it must be in the bell housing.  Here is what happened.  When this 
all happened we were trying to diagnose my stalling problem and for some 
reason the choke wire shorteed and melted causing a short in the ignition 
wire.  I removed all the bad wires and need to lower some of my fuses.  Put 
my old starter back in.  Replaced the auto cutoff on my carb and ditched the 
009 for a 205 AN (orig to the motor) hooked up the advance hose and set the 
timing at 5 ATDC, fired it up and vroom vroom.  Starter worked fine, 
distributor worked fine, but I am still getting surging at idle.  I know I 
must have a vacuum leak, but am having a hard time finding it.  I think it's 
where the butterfly goes through the carb, but I am not sure.  If it is can 
I do anything to fix it?  other than pull the carb and have it redone.

Thanks for all the help on the starter.  The Vacuum Advance Dizzy runs the 
engine alot better w/ stop and go traffic and its cooler.
