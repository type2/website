VWoA confiscated all these mud flap sets from all wholesalers. They were
unauthorized, so I doubt if you'll ever get them and if you ever find them
outside of a dealership, buy them, then whore them off on you know for big
NOLAN money.

pHs; just got off the phone with VW, Vintage Parts Program is still in the
works from VWoA

I bid on a set of bus mud flaps and won.  Not so cheap - $30+

I paid promptly.

Today I get the following from the seller:

**********************

I received notice yesterday that your mud flaps are now on backorder. If you
wish you make get a refund or you can wait.  I'm not sure how long they were
backordered for but I think it should only be a couple of weeks.  I
apologize for the incontinence.
Stay Free,
John

**********************

Well, this guy wears diapers I guess, but that's more information than I
needed to know, and no apology was really necessary.

My reply:

**********************

I think it must be a violation of Ebay rules to put something up for
auction which you don't have.  Fraud?

How long will this wait be?


**********************

This guy is in business, but doesn't seem to be familiar with one of the
most basic aspects of the law: You can't try to sell what you don't own.
