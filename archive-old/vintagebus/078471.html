Subject: Re: [VB] Redux Boxes?

Hello Andy  I have been running a 1835cc stroker motor for 5 years with re 
dux boxes  What the hell are you talking about redux boxes shattering  ???  The 
only time I have seen probolems with redux boxes has been with dummies runing 
with bad bearings and  the spring plate bolts breaking or coming loose, didn't 
have anything to do with the motors. Let me know andyman  I'm very interested 
in knowing  later and have fun  Mark Dearing
