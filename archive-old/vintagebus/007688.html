Rex Wrote about 009s:

&gt;I guess i'm just confused why this is THE disty of choice. Any ideas?

I believe it is the only distributor being produced? I don't think you can
call up VWFLAPS and buy a new vacuum/mech distributor.  Maybe Jim?   009s
are made in Brazil and aren't the quality of the old German ones.  If you
don't have dual carburetors there isn't much reason to use one as far as I
can tell.  I've always gotten better performance out of vacuum/mechanical
distributors using solex carburetors, but also have been able to make 009s
function ok .  Like lots of things if you can rebuild an original unit it
will be superior to a new one I think.
The new vacuum diaphram for my dual hose distributor was almost as much as a
new 009 as I recall so I'm sure lots of people think why not just grab a new
009 and throw it on.
