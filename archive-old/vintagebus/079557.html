&gt; But, on the engines generator pedestal, the
&gt; serial number given is different.  There's
&gt; the letters,   &quot;A  S&quot;   then the six digit number. I'm confused by these two
&gt; sets of numbers. Is this indeed a 1500
&gt; and what set of numbers should I go with? I'm leaning toward the ones on the
&gt; pedestal. However, whats up with the  &quot;A S&quot;
&gt; letters in the serial number?  I don't have a listing for that.  Can someone
&gt; set me straight?
&gt; 

hello mike  That number isnt really on the gen stand is it ,more likely on 
the block under the stand  the stand will say Zundfolge 1-4-3-2  which is the 
firing order  the AS would be a 1974-75 year block should be a 1600cc later and 
have fun  Mark Dearing  Salem Import Service  salem va
