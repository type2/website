Subject: 3 sets of original VW safaris for sale
To: bus list &lt;vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

Since we were on the safari thread figured I woud pass
this on.  These belong to my buddy Mike Jacob.  They
are original VW safaris.  

He is not on-line so email me and I can get ya hooked
up with info.  He has 2 sets available at $600 and
$400.  He says he has another set also but is not sure
what is all there and what price is, will check them
out tomorrow and will have details then.

Email me for full decsriptions and details on each 
set.
