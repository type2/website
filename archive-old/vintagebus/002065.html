Hi All,

For those that care, I found all my missing bolts except for the carriage
bolt that secures the support under the rear seat of my 59 double cab... I
have one of them and both wing nuts but am missing the bolt.  Anybody know
of a junk yard and phone number that I can call that may have one of these
or maybe YOU have one just lying around?  I've even looked in catalogs like
MSC and McMasterCarr to no avail.


David
