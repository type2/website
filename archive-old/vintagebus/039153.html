Subject: FW: DC RHD question??
Message-ID: &lt;DFD1EF94802BD21181C50060080B9D8F146AB4_at_LIMONFS&gt;

I have a RHD 61 doublecab. All busses imported into South Africa by VW
or its agents were in RHD. There is a 60 or 61 doublecab missing its
gates in a VW breakers yard near me going really cheap (like $200). It
needs masses of work  but I think I'll buy it before it gets stripped to
the point where it is unrestorable. If having a RHD 61 DC is &quot;rare&quot; then
having two must be completely &quot;raw&quot;. The yard I referred to is called
&quot;Volkspares&quot;, is there a fairly large company in the US of the same
name? These guys claim to own the US firm.

Oh, not nearly as rare as a splittie hearse!  Your duty  should be to
pass
along the info for the DC RHD to your friends on the list.  I think bye
law 11382 section A, (or is it section B, I always forget) dictates that
&quot;
no one individual shall posses more that two &quot;rare&quot; vintage
Volkswagens&quot;.
I count one Hearse and one limo bug (very rare!)...so sorry, you're over
your limit sir.  Better luck next time ;-).
