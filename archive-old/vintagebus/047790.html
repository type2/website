&lt;&lt; The bus also has a type 181 large style air cleaner and not the correct
 style for that year, if this jogs anyones memory of the bus.   &gt;&gt;
Hi Jack,
Actually if that is what we think you are talking about, it is the Optional
Extra M 155 large style air cleaner for 40HP and 1500 engines.  The early
ones were designed for use with the cyclone prefilter.  Check out K-2  11b in
the fuel section of the #1 pre-1968 VW bus shop manual.
We would be interested in seeing the images you have of this bus!
