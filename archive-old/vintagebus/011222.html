&lt;&lt; Next I took my wheel puller pulling on a 5 to 4 lug adaptor and I totally
 bent the daylights out of the adaptor so trash that idea. &gt;&gt;

When I stripped out a drum, and had a hard time pulling it off the stub axle 
I used one of those wide 5 vw to small 5 chevy wheel adapters with the studs 
knocked out of it. And then used a snap on puller to grip to the wheel 
adapter and kept turning that mother til it popped off. After that we always 
had one of those chavy to VW adapters around in the shop.
