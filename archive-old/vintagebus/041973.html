&gt; Hello all!
&gt; 
&gt; While shopping at the local ACVW junkyard today, I grabbed the 9
&gt; prong box off of a 12v Bug.  Tonight I took it apart and satisfied
&gt; my few lingering curiosities about it.  It's a well-made little
&gt; device.  Most importantly, I found it can be replaced by four relays
&gt; and a generic turn signal flasher

&gt; If anyone is interested, let me know, and I'll work up a detailed
&gt; wiring diagram and specs.  Thanks!

This sounds like a good addition to the Type2 Library!  Go for it!
