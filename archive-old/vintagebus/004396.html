I was indeed complaining about penetrating oil....I was using PB Blaster,
which makes neat smoke when you spray it on hot stuff, WD-40, which is
probably the better, and some other &quot;Rust-Off&quot; or something like that.  I
can't say what actually worked on that bolt...oil, heat, concussion,
cussing, or whatever....probably a combination of all of the above mixed
with 79.98756% perseverance.  Didn't try the parafin and a torch though...

&gt; I think you were the one complaining about penetrating oil the other
&gt; day.  :)  I have no personal experience, but I have seen many people
&gt; online swear by &quot;PB Blaster&quot; penetrating oil.  Around here Wal-Mart
&gt; sells it.  Maybe you have already tried it and found it wanting, but
&gt; I thought I'd pass it along.
