&gt; If you are missing page 107-110....I have them!  It is the section
&gt; covering/depicting carburetors and air cleaners...a must have for the
&gt; manual.  
&gt; E-mail me and send your address...I will send those pages out immediately.
&gt; It is an 11x17 fold-out sheet that was supposed to be hand collated....my
&gt; hand collating works well, but the brain wasn't I guess.
&gt; I apologize to those who are missing those pages but I have them ready to
&gt; send out to you!
&gt; I can receive mesages at    showell_at_i405_dot_com     if you like.
&gt; later
