Subject: RE: Shift rod bushing--and adjusting shifter???
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hello all,
I just got my shifter mechanism back together in my 65
double cab after messing around with it for almost a
month--actually if you start counting when I first
ordered some of the parts it has been over 5 years.
I had to  slit the outer (front) shift rod with a
wheel in a die grinder to get them apart, after
drilling out the broken off setscrew, soaking
everything with different penetrating oils, heating
with a torch, twisting with vicegrips and pipe
wrenches,etc. Luckily I had a spare collar that the
setscrew went in, and everything went back together
okay even with the slit in the front shift rod. 
Replaced the bellows seals with new ones, and replaced
the bushing and the ring-like bushing holder directly
under the shift lever. The ring on the bushing holder
had been broken since before I bought the bus, and
there was no bushing at all, and sometimes(!?) there
was lots of slop in the shifter!
It's all back together now, and I've been driving it
again.  I also put in a new master cylinder, 4 brake
hoses, rear shoes, new gear oil in tranny and RGBs,
greased and adjusted front wheel bearings, and did a
bunch of other little things that needed to be done,
including temporarily putting in a 74 bug 1600 dp
engine until I get around to redoing the single port
that belongs in it.

Question: I don't find any info in the Bentley manual
about adjusting the shifter, so is it done the same as
the bay window bus shifters?  I have that bentley
manual also, and the Haynes for the later bus too, and
they do have some info on adjusting the shifter.  I
followed those instructions for lack of other info,
but I'm wondering if there is anything peculiar to my
65 dc that I should be doing with the shifter.
TIA
Jim (in Wisconsin)

       spare tire cover when we got it)
