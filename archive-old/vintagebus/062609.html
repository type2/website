Subject: oil filler probs

Hey All,

Barely made it to work today!  My oil filler thing just keeps backing of the 
neck.  I have the little tool and keep tightening it to no avail!  Bus got 
loud as I pulled of the exit for home yesterday.  I pull to the gas station 
and my filler thing is almost off and the right top fan shroud opening for 
the heat exchanger hoses if completely off :0
I I had some more hose so I replace both hoses and the little outlet thing 
broke the tack weld.  Is it cool to just tap the shroude and bolt it?  Also 
while in the deck lid I completely took of the oil filler to out the 
threaded cylinder out and checked looks cool threaded it into the neck and 
its fine.  Put filler back on an torqued him pretty good!

Today bus is acting  up (timing)  I replaced the damn points saturday (the 
archive is full of me whining about my bus eating points!) So I guess I get 
to do it again!  On top of that the hose and shroud thing is off and my coil 
  plug wire keeps falling off (thankfully on the coil side no sparky!  
Anyway need tips on oil filler, and fan shroud thing.  Also if I burn points 
wouldn't this excessive abuse fry an pertronix?


Sorry for ramblin, My bus is retaliating, due to being assigned to a 100 
mile a day commute since the suby got wrecked!

Thanks All,

Eric w/ upset bus
