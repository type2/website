I have been in the process of putting together a complete stainless hardware
package for split buses, this will include all hardware necessary to
reasemble the BODY section of your bus, windows, doors, latchs, engine
,decklid etc.. The kits should be complete in the next few weeks, have a
couple made up that i'm sending out as test,will wait for the response
before making available to the general population.

&gt; Can anyone recommend a good source for metric hardware (nuts bolts, studs
&gt; etc).
&gt;

McMaster-Carr has a very good selection of this kind of stuff (I replaced
all my engine tin screws with stainless steel button head Allen screws).
Their catalog is online at:
