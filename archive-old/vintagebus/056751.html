Subject: Re: [VB] shock question

the shocks have a metal ring at the end- with a rubber bushing in it and then 
a metal sleeve in that, right?   

often the sleeve from the old shock rust to the mounting thing, so it looks 
like the new shock is too small.   look carefully see what I mean- so you 
have to remove the old sleeve .  joy

 Today thought i would put shocks on the bus. pulled off the front ones and 
 realized i had the wrong shock. or so i thought. actually they turned out to 
 be the exact same shock, but the bottom part wont fit on the stud. it is too 
 small of a hole. I noticed that the PO cut out the smaller hole in the 
 center of the bushing to allow the old shock to fit. I don't want to do 
 this. Is there a correct shock for my bus? It's a 67 13 window deluxe.
 thanks
