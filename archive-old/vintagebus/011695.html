&gt; Who has the
&gt; best seat kits?

I've had good luck with upholstery from Pony Express in South El
Monte, CA.  They don't sell direct, unless you have no distributor
nearby.  The only fault I found in their kits was the use of nylon
string in place of the original steel wire to hold the cover in place.
 However, the original steel wires slid right into the new upholstery!

Also important is the padding, which is surely shot in your seats.  I
build a base of indoor-outdoor carpet on top of the springs, then put
1/2 inch of high density foam on top of that.  The carpeting is cut
and bent around the perimeter of the springs to protect the new cover
from the metal springs.  Of course, if you can find fitted padding,
that is the best way to go, but none was available when I did my seats
a few years back.

Check your springs carefully while the seat is apart.  It's pretty
common to find a couple of broken springs to replace.
