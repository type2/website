&quot;Another thing.... have you twisted all your fuses in their mounts
thoroughly... Half the stuff on my bus started working when i went to the
fusebox and sat there and twirled all my fuses in their mounts (thereby
burnishing the corrosion off both the fuse and the fusebox)&quot;

With the battery disconnected, a brass brush does wonders for a cruddy fuse
box as does a new set of fuses.
I buy the sets of three brushes (steel, brass, &amp; plastic) several at a time.
