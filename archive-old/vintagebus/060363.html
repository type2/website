Subject: [VB] Tranny question

&gt; I just finished removing the engine from my ' 63 Westy for a rebuild.  It is the first time I've had the engine out.  The trans
seemed to shift well, but I haven't driven the bus too much.  When I pulled the engine out, the input shaft for the trans came out
with it...There is a snap ring on the trans side of the shaft that was partially off,  and that's it.  What should be in the trans
to hold the shaft in?  Will I have to rebuild the trans too ?

The snap ring holds the shaft in.
The input shaft is also splined into the reverse gear,
which has now fallen inside the diff  ( some disassembly required :)
This can be facilitated with either side cover / axle removed, as the
mainshaft is in the center. However, there may be other issues for
which the transaxle should come out for inspection.
( cleaning, worn syncros, bearings).
