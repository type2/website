Subject: RE: [VB] valve noise on new rebuild 1600 sp engine

did you run-in the engine for 20+ minutes at a varying speed above idle to
harden/break in the cam/lifters?
i had a new cam go flat on me which chewed up the cam, lifters, piston
rings, and all bearings. the symptoms were perpetually loosening valves and
really bad loose valve noise all the time. i'd adjust them and within a
very short time, they'd be rattling angain. 
i got about 1k out of the engine before it required total re-rebuild. 
this may be a radical suggestion, but it may be happening.
anyway, good luck.



&gt; [Original Message]
&gt; The valves or really noisy on my new rebuild. Still in the break in phase
&gt; with less that 200 miles on it. I adjusted the valves today and most were
&gt; about .010&quot;. Only one required no adjustment. It seems to me that as the
&gt; valves seat, the adjustment would get tight not loose. Is my thinking
wrong
&gt; here?
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, after the adjustment the noise seemed slightly worse. Being
&gt; paranoid, I got out my St. Muir engine noise tape, and sure enough, it
&gt; sounds exactly like the &quot;loose valve&quot; engine. It appears to be on the left
&gt; side of the engine.

&gt; Any input?
