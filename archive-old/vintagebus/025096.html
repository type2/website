Hi all,

Well with the info I got from some of the Listees (thanks to all), I
forged ahead and went to the DMV this morining.  As I'm standing in
line, I'm talking to a guy and joking about the DMV and there pathetic
antics and just basically BS ing.  When the lady, who's job it is to be
a B&amp;*%# about everything, comes up, I tell her my story.  I want to buy
a car from a guy, who bought it from a guy, who bought it from a guy,
and no one put it in there name.  She says, Oh I'm sorry we can't help
you.  UHHHH  &quot;What do you mean, you can't tell me who owns the car?&quot;
Lady:  &quot;We can't do that&quot;
Me:  &quot;Can I find out if the Car is stolen?&quot;
Lady: &quot;We can't do that.&quot;
Me:  &quot;I've got the VIN and the license plate.&quot;
Lady:  &quot;No, you will have to go to the person who owns the car, find out
who they got it from and find out who they got from.&quot;
Me: &quot;This sucks!!!!&quot;

As I'm walking out the guy I was chatting with hands me a business
card.  Pissed off, I didn't look at it, Thanked him and walked out.  As
I looked at the card outside, the guy was a San Diego Police Detective.
Alright.  Cool

Wasn't somebody, just commenting on having a large reserve of karma.
Well I guess helping the couple in the RB gas station with there '70 bus
that wouldn't start paid off.  Heck I just enjoyed working on a bus.
