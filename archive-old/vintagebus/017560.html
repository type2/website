made it about an ahour ago. 2000 miles in four days. I had my doubts a few
times, but i was lucky the bus didn't have any breakdowns the entire
trip...first time ever!

The bus does seem to be runnign hotter than usual, but i think that is due tot
he fact the the temps were hovering around 100 degrees during the day. this
required stopping every 50-75 miles to give the engine a chance to cool down.

I got to tstop and see John yust in Knoxville, since I last saw him he has
lost one bus, and the roof of another. Otherwise doing ok.

now in houston, and I hope to replce the oil cooler seal soon, and try to find
some contacts that could possibly be dirty on the bus.
