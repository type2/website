&gt;        I was watching &quot;RICKY LAKE&quot; the other day and they were exposing
&gt;people to their phobias in order to cure people of them.  Maybe for the
&gt;next couple weeks, the majority of us can admit that we are anal about
&gt;spelling  and  get over it by intentionally mispelling stuff.  Maybe this
&gt;would &quot;relax&quot; the entire list and let those that are scared to post due to
&gt;the senseless ridicule that they may run into.  This way we can all blend


YOU were watching Ricki Lake? No, no, no, say 'my girlfriend was watching
Ricki Lake' or 'my sister', you get the drift.

Anyway, I must confess to being a not so closet spelling and grammar
teacher. It takes all I can do to refrain from correcting some of these
posts with red ink and sending them back with a grade. But then I take a
deep breath and tell myself that other people don't give a rat's ass about
correct spelling, and that's OK. But please, to lessen the pain you cause,
if you have spellcheck, USE IT. It's free.

OBC, on my last trip to the mountains, I was delighted to find that Rosie's
gas mileage had improved from 17 mpg to 20 mpg. This despite the fact that I
pushed her at 70-80 mph over most of the trip. I assume the increase is due
to reduced friction as the engine has broken in (she also runs cooler than
when I first set up the carbs and checked the mileage). 20 mpg is all I
could ever expect in any of my campers with stock 40hp or 1600 motor, so I
feel this is QUITE acceptable with the large (2110) motor.
