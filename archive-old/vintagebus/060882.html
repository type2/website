Subject: Looking for some sheet metal quick.  Can you help?  

Anyone have a bus they are cutting up or old sheet
metal pieces they are not going to use?  I am looking
for the following by the begining of July.

Front floor, both sides
Outer lower nose skin.  (from crimp up about 5&quot;)
Outer nose crimp plate (behind bumper with square
holes)
Rocker skin, either side.
Rear heater tube cross brace

I know i can get these from WW as a last resort. 
Kelly (Metalwizzard) is not sure he can get me the
parts in time.  I am on a tight budget an was hopeing
to find an alternate source.

Also need a 61/63 front drivers door.
Have safari window parts &amp; old VW mag's to trade or
good old cash.

Thanks for the help.
Matthew
