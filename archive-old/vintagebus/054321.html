Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [VB] Compression ratios on SP engine + clutch disc question

are you running these 7.5 or 7.7 compression ratios on stock engines or
modified (as per your modifications)?  I'm just curious because I've
seen the stuff that you guys do on your site (freezing) and if you're
running higher ratios with modified equipment, that kinda changes the
game.

just curiou

&gt; 7.1:1 is just too low, even for a bus.
&gt; 
&gt; I set 90% of our bus engines at 7.5 or 7.7 according to the year and weight
&gt; of the application.
&gt; 
&gt; Adding any shims WILL change rocker geometry, infact ANY change including
&gt; the flycutting of heads will change the rockers.
&gt; 
&gt; A single port head is tough, give it enough CR to give it more power and
&gt; clean up  the exhaust emissions. I'm not saying to take it super high, but
&gt; my magic number has been 7.%:1, and that normally comes with no shims,
&gt; correct 211 pistons, and a 50cc head.
&gt; 
&gt; We have no problems with this and the engines run just as cool as with super
&gt; low CR.

&gt; question
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Eric and Barb,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks for the information.
&gt; &gt; This is the problem. In order to shim this thing to 7.1:1 CR it will need
&gt; &gt; .070 shims on both sides. I fear that this will &quot;shim out&quot; the heads so
&gt; much
&gt; &gt; that the stock exhaust and single port manifold will not fit. There is
&gt; also
&gt; &gt; the question about throwing off the proper rocker geometry with this
&gt; amount
&gt; &gt; of spacing, and quite frankly, that stuff is beyond my understanding.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; With all stock new parts, I can not figure out why I am having so much
&gt; &gt; trouble.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; These numbers disturb me:
&gt; &gt; Measured deck height:
&gt; &gt; #1  .053 inches
&gt; &gt; #2  .059
&gt; &gt; #3  .047
&gt; &gt; #4  .047
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Why the variance in 1 and 2 and different from 3 and 4?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; These are new VW heads.
&gt; &gt; 1 48.3cc
&gt; &gt; 2 48.33cc
&gt; &gt; 3 48.73cc
&gt; &gt; 4 48.75cc
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I plan to measure everything again tomorrow.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Any input appreciated!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  &lt;&lt;Hi Ric,
&gt; &gt; Definitely rework the head chambers or get matching new heads and still
&gt; work
&gt; &gt; them so they are exactly the same volume and shim under the cylinders
&gt; only.
&gt; &gt; We have been having good results with 7.1:1 CR in our bus&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
