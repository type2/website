 For me too. When I was doing the three am every night reassembly of my dcab
 I cleaned up all the connections that I could find. When I got the battery
 in and ran the electrical stuff I was stunned. The lights were bright, the
 starter spun the newly rebuilt motor like a top and the wipers wiped at a
 speed previously undreamed of.
 
 Unfortunately I didn't seal the connectors and a little over a year later
 corrosion has set in and everything is dimming and slowing. I will be
 cleaning up all the connectors this weekend and using a silicone based
 sealant used for high voltage switchgear that an electrical engineer mate of
 mine swears by.    Later  Michael  &gt;&gt;
Hi Michael,
Thanks for the info!  Eric&amp;Barb
