 I know this isn't exactly vintagebus material, but it 
 is concerning a vehicle with exactly the same engine as 
 in my 67 camper. Anyway, you guys (and gals) know your 
 VW stuff and I trust your advice so . . . I am trying 
 to decided what to do with the ailing engine in my 69 
 Beetle (the bearings are worn, definitly needs a 
 rebuild before I drive it to school in the fall). I 
 think I may start with a new case (or should I stick 
 with the old?). But here is the question, I want to 
 build a reliable, long lasting engine, but if I can get 
 more power out of it without sacrificing reliablity, 
 I'd like to do it. So what displacement do you think I 
 should go for? Carbs? Cam? Exhaust? Just so you vintage 
 nuts know, I would always keep my camper stock, 69 
 Beetles run about a dime a dozen so . . . Thanks for 
 the help.

depends on how much you want to spend. and whether you want a stock or fat 
motor.   

I have a 69 beetle that I got 9 years ago for $100, its the greatest.  Cut 
wheel wells and apron (cheap baja!!!!), ratty funky paint, pretty solid (no 
rust holes when you look under car)   I have a mystery motor that I dont know 
the history of in there, works great.  Seems to have a mild performance cam 
by the sound of it, is full flowed (big plus), 8 doweled crank, runs fine, AK 
case, DP, swivel foot valve adjust screws, Doghouse, thermostat stuff 
installed, have a 30/31 pict carb on it, can get g forces with it, 25mpg, 
stock muffler- put a new german one on there a year or so ago.   I 'm happy 
even if one of the spark plugs is stuck and I don't take it out. the motor 
was pretty much free. three years ago.

if you are building a motor, best to stick with a later case in terms of the 
bigger oil passages and the beter alloy, any of the later A cases, the 
factory installed case savers ones are my favorite.   try to avoid anything 
that has been machined a half dozen times.   you definately get more pep out 
of the same motor in a bug than a bus.  I personally prefer SP, and would 
recommend a less than 8:1 compression ratio for longetivity.  berg says what 
6.5 : 1.   A new stock 1600 sp  feels very powerful in a bug.  

are you sure you need a complete rebuild?   Have you had a compression check? 
  do you have crankshaft endplay ?
