&gt;&gt;I did my rims in Signal White.
&gt;I think that it's too bright and not
&gt;really a close match. If your looking for
&gt;dead on, it's not it. If I were to do it over
&gt;I would try to color match to an original piece
&gt;of bumper or wheels. Yeah it's more expensive to do
&gt;it that way, but the correct color looks better.

There are just as many kinds of white powder (?!) as
Eskimos have words for snow. A color match request
can be accomplished by asking for a test panel and
comparing against the original.
This gets confusing as to whether you want the original
or are trying to match to the antique it has become.
Often a color shade can be influenced by the amount of
gloss, and powder is universally rated on a scale of 0 to 100.
A color match may be photo-analyzed for a perfect match,
same as paint suppliers offer, and an available product can be
adjusted for gloss with the appropriate clear-coat, or a new
batch mixed, which usually gets more expensive because the
chemist has a minimum order for this custom service.
The best inexpensive solution is to work with paper samples,
then request a test panel of the actual product for direct comparison.
