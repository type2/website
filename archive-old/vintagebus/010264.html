http://www.oldcars.co.jp/ is the major one I know about.

I have seen pictures &quot;stolen&quot; from eBay or my site for Buses that have been
purchased by them.

I do not think it is true that cars cannot be brought back because:
1. That sounds like propaganda and
2. I heard mention a year or two ago of someone buying a VW from a Japanese
seller to brought to the USA.

I'm afraid of anyone with a briefcase at a show, money or not.

Regards,
Everett
