Subject: emergency brake woes

So about 2 weeks ago I thought I felt my bus kinda dragging, as if the
emergency brake was on.  I thought that maybe I was imagining it so I drove
off.  I noticed this a couple of times since.  Today I noticed that my
emergency brake was not holding very well when I was parked on a slight
incline and I adjusted my brakes and had everything working very well about
500 to 1000 miles ago.  I'm thinking that maybe there is some sort of crap
in the tubes that my emergency brake cables ride in and   that I ought to
try and cleam em out.  Does this seem reasonable?  Could there be some other
cause for my emergency brake going from grabbing really well at the second
click to hardly grabbing at all at the second last click. I suspect that
these emergency brake cables have been in my bus since 1960 so I guess I
better just replace em.
