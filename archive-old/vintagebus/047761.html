As to manuals, I would get 
Muir's  Idiot Guide,  and also the 
Bentley reprint of the 1963 edition Transporter Workshop Manual. 
  It was written for 63-67 buses, and is the closest thing available for your 
60.  It will cover brakes and motor and rear axle  and body stuff, but not 
the fuel tap, which was used through 61 only ( someone will now say  it is an 
option later)   Any way When you are sitting in the drivers seatif you reach 
down the bump the seat is sitting on to your right there will be a turning 
knob- that is you heat, and to the right of it is a knob.  Pulling that knob 
out all the way flips the fuel tap to reserve. (a gallon or so left).   All 
the way in is on.  halfway out should turn it off.
Even though I have a gas guage in my 65 I keep a little notebook in the bus 
andwrite down when  get gas and how much and occasionallly figure my milage.  
  

You can put a gas guage in, if you really wanted one, but you would need to 
swap out the gas tank.
...............................

Well..as my subject indicates I need some advice on manuals for my bus. 
I am very new to the VW scene, and have recently purchased a 60 dbl
door.  I've had some help working on it, and need to get a good manual,
or perhaps even manuals.  Where is the best place to get one.  Also, I
suppose this question will probably be answered when I get my manual but
where is the reserve tank switch???  My father owned a bug from around
the same time and he says that when he ran out of gas, he had a switch
that gave him reserve fuel.  is there one on my bus????  is it possible
to put in a fuel guage??  be easy on me, I'm learning here!!! I'd
appreciate any advice.
Thanks
Kevin
