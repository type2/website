&gt; Hi folks,
&gt; Just want to alert every one there is a bad virus on the loose. I check the
&gt; list every morning
&gt; along with the on-line local papers from Seattle. This morning there was a
&gt; returned message	

I received 4 or 5 and I'm running a Mac which is usually means I don't
get any.  Don't open anything for a while.

Steve
