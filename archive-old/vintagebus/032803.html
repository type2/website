Subject: Cletus's TV bus **Splitzine**
To: JPHenrikse_at_aol_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Jp and list,
Barry called me to tell me all about the fun week end at the Classic. He also 
said that Cletus had his TV bus set up to run down the high way at 85 mph all 
day long. Do you know if he has a web page on the TV bus? Or do you know the 
mods to it?
Thanks
Kerry
