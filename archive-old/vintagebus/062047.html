       Body filler takes practice and a really laid back attitude.  You going 
to make mistakes so don't get mad at yourself or your bus.  But once you get 
the hang of it----it's almost like art!!!  
       The product you seek is known as spot putty (comes in a tube) or top 
coat (must be mixed).  Spot putty is more for pin holes.  Top coat is a lot 
softer and can be put on bigger areas that spot putty, plus you have more 
control with it. 
       After you get the nose body filler flat (or slightly round in this 
case), I use a cheese grater and a hard block with 80 grit.  Your also going  
to need to learn how  to feel for low and high spots with your hand.  If your 
right handed use your left and vice versa for lefties.  Hold your hand and 
fingers flat and slowly move it across the area that you've been working on.  
Close your eyes and feel the nose.   Sand more if you have to.  You can now 
move on to the &quot;V&quot;.  You can now tape around the &quot;V&quot; part.  Put you body 
filler on the &quot;V&quot; part.  Pull the tape after the filler sets for  3 or 4 
minutes.  Back to the 80 grit, don't worry about perfect, you just want to 
get the basic shape.  Now tape off the &quot;V&quot; again, but this time your gonna 
work the &quot;V&quot; first.  Run your left hand over the &quot;V&quot;Topcoat it and sand it 
down with 180 grit and a hard block.  Take your time and if you need another 
coat of top coat, do it again.  When the &quot;V&quot; is done on to the surrounding 
nose.  Tape off the &quot;V&quot; and go at it with the top coat, sand with 180 and a 
hard block.  Is it pretty?  Now guide coat it and sand every thing lightly 
with 320 girt on a hard block.  This with so any low spots and pin holes.  I 
still like the top coat for the pin holes myself, just because of the 
softness.  But their is some waste if you just working on one area..  Skim, 
sand and prime it.  
       Here's just some loose information on body filler stuff floating 
around my head.  The last shop I worked for, did all the work all the body 
work for the local BMW and  Mercedes dealerships, hence body filler was never 
allowed to be over an 1/8 of an inch thick.  The less filler you use the 
faster you can work it.  Do your metal prep to several dents, so if you have 
filler left over from one dent you can use it on others.  You can sharpen up 
your plastic body filler paddles by rubbing them on a cardboard box.  I use a 
dry wall finishers pallet to mix my body filler on, works great and I really 
dig the handle.  Fold your body filler over it's self when mixing, stirring 
makes air bubbles.  I use a putty knife for mixing, makes your paddles last 
longer.  Where ever you by your body filler, be it an auto body supply place 
or even K-Mart, have them put it on the paint shaker for a few minutes before 
you split.  And I guess the most important thing, wear a mask when sanding!!  
This stuff is really hell on the old lungs!!  
                                                                         
Peace and happy mudding,
