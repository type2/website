&lt;&lt; My helper suggested it could be positive ground.  Is this right? &gt;&gt;
Hi Mike,
Incorrect!  It is just the electricity making the final connection in the 
circuit.  Though you would be much better off while hooking up jumpers to 
hook the last connection one of the ground cables to somewhere other on top 
of the battery.  Where the ground cable bolts to the body or the intake 
manifold heat riser works well.  Then when removing the cables make sure to 
disconnect the ground cable that is away from the battery first.  Doing these 
steps reduces the chance of having the battery blow up from the hydrogen gass 
released when the battery is drained or charged!
  Also making sure the water level in the battery is over the plates at all 
times will prevent having the battery blowing up from having an open spark 
nside the battery jump from one plate to another.  This happened to a brand 
new Mustang next to us one day when the driver tried to start her car up!  
Result was a real messy engine compartment with bits and pieces of battery 
and acid all over!   Eric&amp;Barb
