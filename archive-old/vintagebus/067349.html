Subject: Clutch Job

I've got a 66 Split window that has had some minor conversions.
I'm thinking that I need a new clutch. The van accelerates OK but when
the cam hits its power peak the clutch slips and the engine revs.
The situation is:
72 1600+ Engine.
Independent rear suspension with late transmission.
The tranny looks like it was slipped in with a crow bar and I'm not sure
if I need to pull the tranny and engine as a unit (God Forbid). It has a
remote oil cooler, remote filter, electric fuel pump that are going to
double the R&amp;R efforts.
I've got no idea of what clutch assembly it might require.
I have a new Sachs pressure plate that came with the van Part #
03-3082066101, Stamped in the steel is Type M 215., It measures 215mm on
the pressure surface.
Is there a basic instruction on the Type 2 archives for this procedure?
