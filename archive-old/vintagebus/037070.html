&lt;&lt; Aloha,
   Does anyone have any advice for adjusting their cab
 door hinges?  They're impossible to get right.  The
 doors seem as though they need to be moved upward and
 closer to the front.  Help, it's not going too well.
 Thanks, J.D.

I take it you are replacing a door.

the doors dont adjust at the hinges the way you'ld think they should- it is 
really wierd.   Loosen all 8 screws for the two hinges, and makes sure the 
hinges can be slid in and out of the bus.  It is kind of wierd and hard to 
explain. Trial and error.  I find it really hard to get the doors to line up 
as nice as the factory got them.  but if it seems they need to be moved up, 
you can adjust it by sliding the lower hinge out a tad... I think.

Also, you can adjust the top of the door separately.
