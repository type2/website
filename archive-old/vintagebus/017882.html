Okay, my bad for leaving out a comma and an &quot;a&quot;. How's
this:

I have a 67-only 2/3-1/3 middle seat frame, AND a rear
seat w/ caramel brown upholstery. The rear is from an
earlier year. It has no mount for a jailbar.

&gt; caramel?  but thats upholstery for the 8/58-2/61
&gt; standards, isn't it?   67 
&gt; would have salt and pepper (most commerical, and
&gt; standard micros) or grey (if 
&gt; from an ivory commercial),  the blue/white deluxes
&gt; had the blue/white 
&gt; interior, the green/white and red/white deluxes had
&gt; the mesh platinum 
&gt; interior which turns a sort of coppery colour which
&gt; is the closest to caramel 
&gt; that came original to a 67.   just wondering.   does
&gt; your rear seat for the 
&gt; deluxe bar?   the middle seat has the plasticy
&gt; rubbery covered bar on top 
&gt; like the dash grab handle?  I can't look at web
&gt; sites right now as my 
&gt; computer died just out of warranty and am waiting
&gt; for the cheap motherboard 
&gt; and in the meantime am using a black and white
&gt; screened laptop so websites 
&gt; are blurs.  cant deal with colour.
