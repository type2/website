&lt;&lt;  I think I recognize that brand. I think that's the brand I
put in my  bus over four years ago and they're Korean. Even 
if it isn't the same  brand, I'm sure the bearings I used were 
from Korea and they cost  about $8.00 each (not the N207 
roller, it was more like $20.00). I put  Czechoslovakian (sp?) 
bearings in my truck a couple of years ago and  they were 
about half the price of the big name brands too. They're 
also still doing just fine &gt;&gt;

My supplier is still checking on mass order price breaks
and for Japanese car OEM mfg. of bearings.  I can also put
together a list of 3rd world county of origin for the bearings
as well.  That way you will be able to decide whether or not
you want FAGs, Japanese, or Albanian bearings in your
reduction boxes.

BTW- I think that John is correct in that KMLs are from Korea.
