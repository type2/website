&gt;  Also my seat if from a standard not a deluxe. I was wondering if anyone had
&gt;  the chrome pieces for the grab bar they would be willing to sell / loan me?
&gt;  I have been doing custom goldsmithing for over 10 years now and would like
&gt;  to make molds off of the chrome pieces so I can cast them in brass and then
&gt;  have them chrome plated.
&gt;  

I believe the middle seat is the same for a standard or deluxe.  the 62-67 
seats had chrome ends and rubber covered metal handle on the top of the seat- 
same sort of handle as the dash grab handle, except the ends are chromed not 
plastic.   

  The REAR seat for a deluxe carried the jailbar, the standard rear seat did 
not have that.
