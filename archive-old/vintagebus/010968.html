I'm 15 Live in Texarkana Ar, Happy to say that I got my hands on a '62 fairly
well off Bus with walk through..a bit of rust which is a relief after my last
bug which turned out a flop....Buying it for 150 bucks and it needs two rear
wheel drums, an engine(which I have from last bug), and some minor body work.
But as to the why of it...I think it's because The Buses and bugs last better
around the coastal areas...it's less humid and therefore rust does not take
it's toll as down here..of course Texas is better than Southern Arkansas but
It is still worse than the coasts.
