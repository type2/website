Subject: making room ... collectibles for sale

Hello all!
I hope this isn't a friday-only thing because it isn't technical in
nature...it's been awhile so I apologize if I goofed.

I have to clear out my 'extra room' to make it an actual 'guest room' and have
a few nice items I have collected that someone here may like.
books, models, posters (repro), vintage Life magazine ads (real)

I was thinking about going to eBay but ... I actually got several of these from
members here so it's kinda like 'keeping it in the family' &lt;grin&gt;

anyway, please email me if anything looks interesting to you.

thanks
melissa
