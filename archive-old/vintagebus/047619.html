&lt;&lt; I had a sticky turn signal that I recently cleaned. I used electrical 
 contact cleaner and a toothbrush- which worked well and made the contacts 
 shine. I need the lists knowledge as far as what is the grease that was on 
 there before keeping it lubed? Is the bosch distributer grease correct or 
 dielectric grease possibly? TIA.

I recently was hurrying through WalMart and saw a small tube of &quot;Light bulb 
lubricant&quot; that claimed to be anti-oxidant for light bulb contacts and 
holders.  Didn't have time to stop and read the contents but intend to go 
back.  Has anyone heard of or used this product?  It sounds like the VW 
owners dream if it is true.
