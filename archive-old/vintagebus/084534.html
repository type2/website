Subject: Re: [VB] Final BOTC Update

We can attest that Whitby is still here although we have not made it to the site quite yet.  Still a couple KM to go.  Sitting in front of Future Shop for last minute updates using their wifi.  Nice folks that give us free wifi when traveling.  So the rain has stopped and we are about to drive over.  Hope to see folks here tomorrow.

P &amp; C
Still have not left the eastern part of the continent.
Headed to Terryville, CT in another week.
