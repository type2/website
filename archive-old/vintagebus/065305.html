1965 SO42 Westfalia for sale.
 Re-sprayed (exterior) in '98 in original Dove Blue by
a fairly competent shop. I have been adding chips and
dings to the front end for the last 35K on a rebuilt
motor and tranny. Freeway flyer transaxle still does a
pretty decent job pushing along the bus with help from
the almost stock 1600cc. Motor has doghouse, full
flow, solid shafCWCCWCS, and has been balanced. All of
that is wrapped in all of the 1965 correct tin with
the exception of the correct fresh air heater hose
clamp and the addition of an alternator.
 Newer brakes and related springs and M/C help to stop
205/75/15 tires mounted on 15&amp;#powder-coatedated vw
bus rims that sport dove gray hubcaps.
 While camping in this bus you would enjoy many
creature comforts. Driving on a hot day is no problem
in this transporter! Just flip open Safari saris or
turn on the ambulance fan to enjoy some fresh air. 
 Better yet, after you exit the drivers compartment of
this non-walkthrough bus take a moment to admire the
redone salt and pepper seat and new door and kick
panels. But the fun doesn't stop there! This bus not
only is a pop-top with a very nice interior that
includes the child'st childs cot and
oupholsterypolstery but it is also has all of the
original cabinets and redone door and side panels!
 Take your lunch down from the original westy rack on
the rear or the after- market short westy rack on the
front and relax in the correct &quot;over the pole&quot; big top
tent. 
 As night nears and a chill settles in on your
campsite, move inside and enjoy a good book by the
light of 12 volt electrical system. Still cold? Reach
over the front seat and switch on the rebuilt BN4
Eberspacher gasoline heater for a dose of hot air. 
 
Waking up in this bus thating taht it was traded for
only your first born,  your best dog, and a suitcase
green backseenbacks will have you grinning ear to ear,
knowing that YOU had truly found a deal.
