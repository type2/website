&gt;You guys don't even know the half of it.  You sell the bus to them for 
&gt;BIG bucks, and not even a week after it gets over there, you hear air
&gt;sirens sounding, people clear the streets, and.....
&gt;
&gt;GODZILLA rises out of the ocean, wreaking havoc on Tokyo and the bus 
&gt;gets squashed flatter than a pancake!

Either that, or the ADP (Amazingly Destructive Police) start
chasing some guy (or gal) who is wearing a big mech suit, and
during the chase, crash into the Bus...or the guns, lasers, 
bombs, and other ordnance used in such pursuits takes out the
Bus...

Just remember...whenever driving your Bus, take a grip of
steering ( http://www.engrish_dot_com/images/cars/nissan.jpg ) or
you may experience Super Brain Panic!
