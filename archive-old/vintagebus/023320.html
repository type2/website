Subject: my VG/BW bus pics/Re: [VB] Original bus color ? 
To: larc_at_tdk.dk, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

That bus looks like Velvet Green.  L512.   This colour was available 65-67 
one tone for commercials,  and in 65 VG/BlueWhite for passenger type 2.  In 
66/67 for the passenger  buses it was VG/ Pearl White.

There is of course variations within the realm of Velvet Green.  Different 
batches were slightly dif.  Also this 30+ year old original point gets darker 
with age.  Look in engine compartments or some where out of the sun for 
original colours.   My 65 westy was VG/BW (someone paid extra for 2tone paint 
on a type 23 westy, sold in Germany) so I looked at VG for a long time 
wondering if my green was a good version.  Will the real Velvet Green please 
stand up!

Some pics of my bus ~3 years ago shortly after it was painted.  (the bumpers 
have been done since).  The bus was painted outside and on the dash, and the 
rear apron was removed and painted, but the engine compartment/inside of lid 
is original VG paint, and so is the green by the spring plates. This bus has 
no westy m code, and some people thought it was retrofitted, but see these 
pics of BW inside( only the dash was repainted, as the PO had housepainted it 
brown with a brush-UGLY) on the metal divider and by the back windows etc.  
Euro version- no louvered side windows.   I wish I had &quot;before&quot; pics up, 
cause it looked truly crusty. Metallic blue badly done, kinda like the front 
bumper.
