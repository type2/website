&gt;Can somebody give me a good explanation/definition of Dwell?

Dwell is a measure of the amount of time that the points are closed.
It is usually given in degrees - crankshaft degrees, I think, but
I'm not sure.

When the points are closed, current is flowing in the primary of the
ignition coil, building up a magnetic field in the coil.  When the
points open, this magnetic field collapses and induces a voltage in
the secondary of the ignition coil to fire the plugs.

If the points are not closed for long enough (gap too large/dwell too
short), the field in the coil doesn't build up very far, and the voltage
induced in the secondary is lower.  This leads to misfiring or a complete
lack of spark at the plugs.

If the points are closed for too long (gap too small/dwell too long),
the field in the coil builds up far enough, but the coil also starts to
overheat.  This can also lead to a reduction in secondary voltage, and
it definitely makes your coil burn out sooner.

At lower engine speeds, it's easy to get &quot;enough&quot; dwell - the cylinders
fire far enough apart that you can leave the points closed long enough
in between firings that the coil stores up an adequate amount of energy.
At higher engine speeds, when the cylinders fire much more rapidly, it
is sometimes difficult to leave the points closed long enough before
you have to open them to fire the next cylinder, and secondary voltage
suffers.  This is part of the reason why newer cars have gone to multiple-
coil ignition systems - each coil gets plenty of time to &quot;charge up&quot;
before it has to fire, ensuring a strong spark each time.

I hope this helps!
