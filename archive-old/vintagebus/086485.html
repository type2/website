Subject: Re: [VB] re:Battery Recommendation

Thanks to all who have replied - if nothing else, I've learned a lot.

To expand on the situation; sometimes, it can be 6-8 weeks between 
start-ups.  Also, the battery in the bus now is a VERY cheap one, in fact, 
I think it's even a rebuilt one. 

Nothing I hate more than electrical problems.  Should I start running down 
a possible short somewhere in the electrical system, or should I suspect 
that a cheap battery, combined with long periods of not starting the car, 
as the culprit?  Trying to do anything/everything to not have to start 
looking for a short/power drain.  The wiring harness in this particular 
bus is pretty strait, not hacked up at all.  I'm the 2nd owner of the bus, 
and it was pretty solid when I got it.

Thanks again,
Ed
