Subject: Source for correct 6v battery??
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSI.4.05L.9903141634230.346-100000_at_oddball.atlasta_dot_net&gt;

Hey folks.

Anyone have leads on who carries the correctly sized 6v battery for a 66
bus?:)  that fits under the cover, and is held down by the strap?:)

The one's I've been able to find (Advance, autozone) are the larger
version, that does not fit correctly...

thanks...david
