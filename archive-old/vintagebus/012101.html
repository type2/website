&gt; My friend, Casey Missal, is having a problem getting the Bus Depot
to be 
&gt; responsive about a part he ordered. I was just getting ready to
place an 
&gt; order for rubber seals from there but am now concerned. What
increases my 
&gt; concern is that they do not answer my emails. I am interested in
knowing 
&gt; list members experiences and whether I should place my order.

The Bus Depot folk are up to their eyeballs in alligators these days. 
They just got back from Europe where they searched out a bunch of rare
(to us) bus parts.  I'm very willing to put up with
less-than-immediate service from an outfit that delivers quality parts!

I've placed two orders with them, and been very pleased with the parts
received.  As someone who has dealt with JC Whitney's 6-week shipping
window I find that Bus Depot does a good job.  If you're used to
getting what you want via Federal Express overnight you will be
disappointed.

Ron has posted to the list requesting that those folk who need to
contact him immediately give him a call on the phone for fastest
service.  Lower priority stuff goes to email (such as &quot;does part X fit
bus Y questions), so your email is probably buried in the &quot;to do when
swamp is drained&quot; pile.

&gt; Also, the seal for the rear hatch is REALY EXPENSIVE! Does nayone
know if 
&gt; there is a good substitute available in a hardware store or something?

Seal prices usually depend upon the demand for the part and whether
someone has tooled up to make a repro.  Sounds like you need a seal
that hasn't been in production for a while.  Hardware store
substitutes are always possible, but usually aren't as nice as the
correct part.
