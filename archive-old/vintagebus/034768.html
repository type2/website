 A while back when we were talking about M 164 I sent what I had from
 the Doliwa book...the book has 3 different lists: splitty, bay, Vanagon;
 but within the lists some of the codes have dates on them when the
 meanings changed.  I've never seen a &quot;full&quot; early list.
 
 &gt;Maybe I should started studying the supercession lists.  excitement.
 
 Maybe some day when it's raining too hard to work on the Bus...I hear
 that it doesn't rain much up there though.  :)

ya- the list with dates would be interesting to look at -  do you have that 
on the computer somewhere?   no it doesn't seem to rain much recently, less 
that half the usual rainfall.   In fact, it is officially a drought,  people 
are worrying about enough water for fishes, let alone hydroelectricity.
