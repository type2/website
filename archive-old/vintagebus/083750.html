Subject: High Country Trip Report

I'm kinda surprised I have not seen one yet. here was ours.


High Country Bus Festival
July 29-31, 2005
Boone, NC

A weekend spent among friends in the hills is always nice, add a bunch
of buses to the mix and it just gets better. So we happily drove from
Middle TN for another High Country. This year we increased our HCBF
quota by one, with Olivia. I've been looking forward all year to her
first birthday at High Country, but I should start at the beginning I
suppose. I guess traveling on the road for a few weeks tends to make you
a bit lazy for preparation over &quot;just a weekend&quot; trip. I'll assume this
was the reason we didn't do anything to prepare until Thursday night.
Fortunately with us in the height of camping season everything was
handy. Steph and I were unsure when our departure time would be. Normal
operations is to grab a quick nap in bed then head out late pm/early am.
Feeling the adventurous soul I am I though this trip we would just head
out when everything was packed and if tired stop at a wally world for a
quick nap. 

At 11 with everything and everyone packed we left the driveway and
pointed tigerbus towards it's final destination east of us in yonder
hills. The weather was quite nice and cool, making the drive enjoyable,
but uneventful. I was good to go for a few hours, but as we approached
Cookeville I really felt the lack of sleep take it's toll. I pulled off
the interstate and rolled into the Wal-Mart parking lot where a tour bus
was parked. We pulled the curtains and got out the pillows. I was worn
out, but trying to get comfortable up front was a challenge. About the
time I drifted off Olivia had enough of sitting still, and started to
whine. It sure appeared this situation would not work, so I started the
bus up again, and off we went further down the road. I guess the 3.75
minutes of sleep was enough to get to Knoxville. We gave this Wal-Mart
sleep another try and this time it worked. I woke with the sun just up
about three hours later, with a slightly stiff neck. 

A quick assessment of the situation and time of day led me to think we
should just go ahead and pass through K-town before rush hour on Friday
got started. A quick drive and we were on the other side. Took a gas and
breakfast break for a few minutes, and headed out again. Before we knew
it we were nearly there. Before going to the camp a quick stop for a
birthday cake for Olivia was schedules. The nice bakery lady managed to
make a beautiful cake for us and within half an hour the bus was moving
down the hill towards the campground. Pulling in and crossing the new
bridge was nice. Always a great feeling seeing your first glimpse of
buses set up for camping. After registering we drove up and quickly
found our site which Brad, Ric, and Jenn were so nice to save. The kids
were unloaded and the remainder of the early afternoon was spent doing
the normal setup. In between camp tasks I managed to sneak away a few
times to visit with some old friends, and check out who was already
here. At some point Ronnie and family gave Olivia a birthday present (a
bubble blower) which seemed to be a huge hit with the kids. Also Anita
gave her a little bus gremlin bell. Thanks so much everyone those were
very thoughtful gifts.

As the tent and other misc things were finally set the remainder of
Friday was spent watching and visiting. All the while taking turns with
Olivia. She spent quite a while in the backpack on my back while walking
around. We also admired the bocce players all practicing for the big
tournament on Saturday. Dinner for the evening was courtesy an older
couple I met while in Colorado, who gave me a recipe of a great and
easy chicken pasta. Worked great and should be available in the FMBC
cookbook at a later date. All the kids enjoyed this and soon we were
back to hanging out and enjoying the weather. Most of the day the
weather was overcast which helped with the temperature. We couldn't have
asked for a more perfect day. As the day wound down we managed to find
our kids and get them in bed. Jenn had started a very nice fire that
raged in the center of us as we all sat and enjoyed each others company.
Steph hit the bed a little bit later. I stayed up for a while then
walked to the bus as well and retired for the night. 

It sure was good to get a nice nights sleep. Our location was close
enough to the creek to hear it bubble all night long. I think it helped
everyone sleep well. Soon morning came and we all gave a happy birthday
to Olivia, who was up bright and early. Breakfast burritos was next on
the agenda. I was one of the first down there and with a birthday girl
hanging on my back I started to work along with the others on one heck
of a breakfast. I spent the morning cooking eggs. Pretty standard FMBC
breakfast which went off very well. There was even plenty for the cooks
as well. After breakfast I spent a little while talking cameras with a
couple of lovely ladies (Sheila and Sherrel), and then managed to wander
around a bit. After a lovely lunch of cheese toast we rounded up the
kids to sing happy birthday to Olivia and then cake was given out. I
really enjoyed this.  Something to remember. With a full stomach she
didn't seem too interested in eating her cake, and in fact just crawled
over it while I had my head turned. 

After all the festivities the Bocce tournament was beginning to form. I
grabbed my camera to take some action shots and headed down to the
pavilion. I thought there would be way too many people playing the game
so I held out from playing. Turns out there was plenty of space to play,
and I headed back up to drop off the camera and get my bocce on. I had
never even picked up a bocce ball, but like everyone says it only takes
a few minutes to learn. The rest of the early afternoon was spent
getting the hang of it. What a great fun game. I will end up getting a
set of these balls. I got teamed up with many different teams as we
swapped around. Had a great time with everyone. Thanks to Steve for
putting this on. Unfortunately the beginners luck for this even didn't
quite help me get in the final four. While this was going on the kids
were all working on activities. I'm honestly not sure what all they did,
but some of the things were a scavenger hunt which Stryder and Chloe
were on the winning team, and home made ice cream with coffee cans. After
the tournament Jamie Auch gave me a lift into town for a few supplies.   

With the ceremonies nearing camp stoves and fires started to light up in
preparation for dinner. Joining in seemed to be the thing to do. As our
clan waited for dinners to finish cooking the sky started to cloud up.
Seems the magic words to make the rain come is &quot;no, it will just blow
over&quot;. No sooner had I uttered those works did the rain start. Quite a
rain it was. Steph managed to get dinner off the stove and I got Olivia
out of the rain. The next hour or so was spent cooking, and eating under
all manor of tents and ez-ups. Finally the rain stopped and Buddah drove
around the camp alerting everyone of the events that had been shifted
in time by about half an hour. The only person who didn't eat was Wyatt
so I tried to start the Coleman to heat up his dinner, however ran into
a bit of problem. I finally got it lit, but the stove took on a mind of
it's own and started to burn water. At least that's what it looked like.
Seems the connection tube in the stove had become full of liquid fuel
and kept feeding off itself. I kept an eye on it at the start of the
evenings festivities and it finally burned out.  

I got down to the pavilion about half way through the kids door prizes,
and found a spot next to Jamie. Someone thought it would be a great idea
to give all the kids whistles. Guess what happens? If you guessed lots
of loud noises, you are correct. After that settled down the Twins and
the rest of their scavenger hunt team got awards of a toy and chocolate.
Pretty neat. They all seemed very happy with themselves. Next came the
door prizes and peoples choice awards which came in typical HCBF
fashion, with the winners happy to receive some neat prizes, and the
losers glad they didn't get kidney beans. The evenings organized goings
on finished with the band starting pickin'. I went back to camp to help
watch Olivia, but sure enjoyed the music that made it's way up the hill.
After getting the kiddos rounded up again and put down, Steph and I just
relaxed around another Jenn fire pit. The rest of the evening was spent
just like the night before relaxing and enjoying good company. The only
exception to this was walking over to the big screen to watch Buddahs
directorial debut from his days in school. That was a hoot, and if I
must say &quot;Bitchin'&quot;. Late that night it started to sprinkle so we took
this as a hint to hit the bed. Turns out the rain only lasted a few
minutes, but we went ahead and went to sleep.

Morning rolled around, and with it the dread of packing up. Naturally the
thought of it far exceeded the reality. This year we had decided to not
go on the carabus, and get back home so we didn't have that time line to
stick with. As the buses rolled out for the carabus I sat on the old
bridge and snapped everyone that drove past. Hopefully I can assemble
something fun with it. I walked back up after they left and we finished
our packing. By this time most of the campground was empty. Ric and I
watched as one of the huge land barges (RVs) ran out of diesel and just
quit on the hill. We anticipated this guy trying to roll down the hill,
but fortunately for him, he didn't. I nearly asked if he wanted a push
start, but decided against it. After final good byes we all headed home.
We followed Ric part of the way, and left him at Roan Mtn. The remainder
of the trip home was in and out of some pretty intense rain, that only
lasted a few miles or so. Eventually we pulled into our driveway and
unloaded the bus. 

Once again we had a wonderful time. To all those I met and can remember
your name see you next time (insert name here). To all those I met and
can't for the life remember who you are we can try next time, and
finally to all those who I didn't meet, look for us. At some point I
will stumble through your campsite. Thanks Buddah.
