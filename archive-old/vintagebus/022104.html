&gt;Can anyone decipher this &quot;M&quot; Tag? I've looked through all my books, and some

&gt;I've got the chassis number, date of manuf. the &quot;080&quot; and &quot;108&quot; figured out.
&gt;But the color codes, &quot;B42&quot;, and UJ don't make sense.

B42 is a code for the SO-42 Westfalia camping interior

UJ is the port code for Honolulu for earlier buses, but may be Jacksonville 
   for later buses (I have never seen written confirmation of this)

523907 is the color code for Pearl White upper and lower body colors and 
   mesh gray front seats.  The Westfalias &amp; other special models had a 
   unique color code system.  The Westys were made from Kombis typically, 
   but were painted differently than a regular Kombi.  A regular Kombi 
   was only primered inside the rear cargo area and the Westys were 
   painted inside the rear cargo area.
