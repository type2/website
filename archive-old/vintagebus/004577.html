 On the way back from the Seatle show last July came through Caldwell Idaho
and saw 3 split buses on the north side of freeway. Circled back and they
were in a tow storage yard and the yard owner said they belonged to his
lawyer and though they might be for sale.  He tried to contact the lawyer
and couldn't get him so we left. Someone in that area might want to check
them out.
