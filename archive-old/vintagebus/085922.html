&gt; Good morning all!
&gt; I am working on this 60 bus, it is pre-gas gauge era.
&gt; Anyone ever retro-fit a later tank with a gas gauge in
&gt; one of these early splits? To me, it seems like it
&gt; would be as easy as puttin in the new tank with a
&gt; sender, intsalling a gauge on the dash and running the
&gt; wires as normal?? Am I over-simplifying this
&gt; retro-fit, is it really as easy as it seems to me???
&gt; If so, anyone want to trade a later split tank with
&gt; sender for an early split tank with the reserve tap included??

IIRC, a pre-fuel-injection bay tank will fit with a little judicious
denting in the middle bottom.  You can use your original gas valve
outlet, so you have the best of both worlds!  5 more gallons and a fuel
reserve/shutoff capability!

You will have to pull the engine to swap tanks, of course!
