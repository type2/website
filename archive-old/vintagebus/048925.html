Subject: Koch's Steering Wheel Resto

I had my steering wheel recently redone by Koch's.

I sent in my old wheel, which BTW had absolutely no cracks in it, and when they received it they called me right away and quoted me the price of $125.00.  I said o.k. and in about 3 weeks the wheel arrived.

Only problem was they didn't send me my wheel back.  I deduced this by looking at the bottom of the wheel and noticing one of the screws that holds the turn switch cancel ring on was broken off in the wheel. ?  I went and grabed my bag of parts I kept when I pulled the wheel and sure enough, all 3 screws were there.

The good news is I called Koch's, they determined who they sent my wheel to, sent me a UPS call tag for the other persons wheel, and within about 10 days got my wheel back.  Slight hassle but no big deal.  

If you have sentimental value in your wheel I'd suggest marking it somehow so you can tell if it's yours.

Robert
