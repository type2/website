Dave,
there is a cross over point between HP and longevity. VW engineers came up
with the best gear ratio for the minimum HP to power each vehicle in the
class. That is why the gear ratios for the bug and bus and T-3 are not the
same. Different weight vehicles required different gear ratios for the same
HP motor. 

When you change anyone of these constants then you lose something. If you up
the HP then you lower the life expectancy. I draw the line at 70 reliable HP
with my mix of parts. after that, it's cuttin n drillin. Remove metal,
remove strength. 

You can blue print a 1600 and it may last a month if the materials used were
bad. Be careful in picking your parts. Thick wall cylinders over thin wall,
new heads over fly cut, counterweighted crank over factory, and balanced
rods and pistons.

Personally, I go up one with 88mm thick wall pistons/sleeves and bore the
block and 041 heads. Shot peen the factory 311 rods and balance the pistons
with deck height at .060-.070. At that displacement and RPM you can use a
welded counterweighted crank, but new cast counterweighted cranks are about
the same price. Large Melling oil pump, Engle 100 for bus, Engle 110 for
car, and 1.25:1 ratio rockers with swivel feet. I've had good luck with
34PICT-3 and center mount progressives rejetted on the 36mm side. I like to
use the 205 vac distributor but the SVDA vac works good also. I use dual
point 050 on bugs and T-3 because I like how the advance comes in.

too much info makes my head hurt

Groovy. I'm too lazy tonite to go do the math, but it appears you
are seeking lower CR as you increase bore size with this theory,
and have three different CR values for these three engines.
Longevity ( a good thing ) is sacrificing horsepower ( another good thing ).
You have stated your preferences for CR with factory parts tolerances.
Would you be willing to offer a little more power to the blueprinter ?
