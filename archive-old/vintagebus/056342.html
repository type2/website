Subject: Re: [T2] dist part #'s


&gt; this is for the guru's out there. The dist on my latest franken motor is vw
&gt; part# 043 905 205. I dont have this # in any of my books and the dist drive
&gt; cogs seem off to me. Does anybody know what this thing came off of?
&gt; thanks all
&gt; Chuck

However, Jim also says it fits an auto-stick 1970 beetle. But when you peruse
the part numbers listed for that application, it does not appear. But 113 905
205 AL does, which is the 'can use' number on the 1974 Fed 1600..... So the
original application would be the 74 beetle.
