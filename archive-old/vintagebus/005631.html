Yeah Rex - Ronnie has done that to me several times.  He keeps on top on
what's going on the list and then when you call him, he just about has your
order packed and ready to go because he knows that you aren't going to be
able to find the part you need anywhere else anyway.  :-)

You just can't beat Ronnie when it comes to Type 2 parts.  Ronnie is so damn
good, he has the likes of RMMW and other big VW parts warehouse's calling
him up and they're on their knees begging for parts.  I ain't kidding you!
We ought to all feel privileged to have Ronnie on this list.  He really has
his act together and knows his buses!!!
