Subject: Re: [VB] Indecent Proposal

I used to shop Ebay for bus parts a LOT...now, hardly
ever and here's why:  Do a search for &quot;vw bus&quot; in Ebay
motors, you should get about 600-800 matching items. 
Now scan thru all those items and see just how many
are ads for new aftermarket parts that you could buy
for the same price or cheaper from any online vendor. 
My un-substantiated guess is at least 60%, and I
believe that to be a conservative guess.  These same
ads relist, &amp; relist, &amp; relist etc. I have seen the
same ad for a new 009 distributor with a starting bid
of 59.99 and a buy it now for 64.00, I know there are
a couple of vendors on the VB\T2 list that sell these
for 49.99, no bidding no hassle shipped that day.
If permitted to, I could just see all these guys who
usually advertise this stuff on Ebay to come and clog
up the list with these same kind of &quot;deals&quot;.  Want
more list traffic?? There you have it!!  I have to
assume this is why the no ebay ads philosophy evolved.
What I really wish would happen with Ebay is that
there would be a different category for USED parts and
NEW parts, then you may be actually able to find a
deal on some used stuff, because lets face it, you
virtually never find a deal on anything NEW.
