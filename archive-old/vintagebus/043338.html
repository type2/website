&gt;Well, I saved that damn little piece of paper for 2 years and now when I
&gt;need it I can't find it. I've got a standard horn relay with 30, 87, 87a,
&gt;86, &amp; 85 terminals. Got an Ooh-gah horn with + and - on it. How do I hook
&gt;up the relay. The horn is switched using the ground. Thanks.

86 and 85 are the coil, and 30, 87, and 87a are the contacts.

Wire 86 to a hot wire (battery hot or switched by ignition, your
choice.)  If you're paranoid, put a 1 amp fuse in wire from 86 to
the hot connection.  Wire 85 to the wire coming from the horn
button.  When you push the horn button, the relay should click.

Now, wire 30 to a hot wire (again, battery hot or switched,
your choice).  This wire supplies the new horn, so if you want
to fuse it, the fuse has to be rated for at least the horn
current - I have no idea how much your horn draws but I'd guess
anywhere from 2 to 5 amps max.

Wire 87 to the + terminal on the horn, and wire the - terminal
on the horn to ground.  When you push the horn button, you
should get an Ooh-gah.

You won't use the 87a terminal at all.  30 and 87 are connected
when the coil is energized (horn button pushed - what you want);
30 and 87a are connected when the coil is NOT energized (horn
button not pushed - not what you want!)  If the terminal hanging
there bothers you, put a bit of tape around it or buy a fully
insulated female push-on and put it on the terminal.

Probably all the contacts can be done with 1/4&quot; push-ons.  If
you want a neater job, poke around at the local car-alarm
shop for a relay socket.  The terminal configuration for this
kind of automotive relay is fairly standard and they should
be able to hook you up with a 5-wire socket that will work.
They also probably sell a dual socket but it's pre-wired for
a door lock application; the single socket just brings all
five terminals out on about a foot of color-coded wire.
All Electronics, http://www.allcorp_dot_com/ , also sells these
sockets - I don't work for them, just a customer.

Note: Most &quot;proper&quot; (IMHO) relays of this type are single-pole, 
double-throw.  In other words, 30 is connected to either 87 or
87a depending on whether the coil is energized or not.  All of
the Bosch brand relays I've dealt with have been like this.  On 
some &quot;cheap&quot; five-terminal relays, such as the ones sold at your
FLAPS for driving lights, the relays are single-pole, single-throw,
and 87 and 87a are connected together.  It doesn't matter one
bit for your horn application, but for some other uses, this
might be important.

Good luck!
