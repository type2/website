&gt; hey all,
&gt; is there some trick to getting the nuts off of the #3 and #1 exhaust
&gt; studs?  I want to change my heater boxes...I've been soaking the nuts in
Take a chisel and hammer and carefully cut a notch into the nut. Dont
get all the way to the threads, or you will damage them. This notch,
believe it or not, will allow the nut to come off the stud a lot easier.
This is a very very common method to remove old exhaust nuts.

If you are just having trouble getting to the nuts with the engine in, I
suggest getting an &quot;s&quot; shaped 13mm wrench.
