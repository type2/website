Subject: Light bulb cross reference...

------=_NextPart_001_0000_01C21201.E82B8A30

Hi all,

What a great &quot;OCTO/Classic&quot; weekend that was!  All of the local So Cal bo=
ys put on an AWESOME party for all of us to attend.  I bought a lot of NO=
S goodies for my fleet of old VW's, but more importantly, I got to spend =
a lot of time with many old VW friends throughout the long weekend!

My question is:  Can anyone point out a cross reference guide to the vari=
ous light bulbs used on our older VW's.  I'm sure VW published one in the=
ir Factory/dealership manuals or literature.  I'm going through some old,=
 used bulbs and I have a lot of both German and USA made used bulbs lying=
 around.  In the VW Workshop manuals and parts manuals, bulbs are referre=
d to by their VW parts numbers, such as: N 017 718 1, etc.  Most USA made=
 bulbs run another system of bulb numbers, such as: 1157, 1073, 67, 1156,=
 1154, 63, etc.  So, if there is a cross reference guide out there somewh=
ere, could someone post the web address so all of us could finally figure=
 out what the hell we've got, and what it will work on?  I know I saw one=
 a long time ago in some VW publication, but the hell if I know where to =
start looking for it again!

Thanks for the bulb reference, and again thanks and congratulations to Ri=
ch Y, Lenny C, the Empi folks, Rich K, Charlie H, Moe and the OCTO guys, =
Ed E, the Berg's, and all the others and their staff's and friends for ho=
sting an awesome time for the rest of us!
