Subject: Dec 6th - 9th Annual Mid-Atlantic Holiday Fest: Last Call

Don't let a little precipitation scare you off, our
little town keeps the streets clear! 

Bring something to share- food or drink, and see your
list friends, always some interesting buses, and get a
door prize.

Earlier this week busses launched from as far away as
Phoenix AZ for the event, so if you are not already on
the road you are unlikely to win the &quot;longest
distance&quot; award. That doesn't mean you shouldn't come
though; drop me a line if you haven't already so we
can keep up with the headcount. If you decide at the
last minute that is fine too, no need to RSVP - all
are welcome. Surprise us.

Hope to see you here!

1-5pm Saturday
