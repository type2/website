Ofcourse not 2 days after we leave Busses by the Arch something in the
transmission goes........

I can't keep it in fourth gear at all ....... It just pops out ....... A
bungee cord, my hand with all my force won't keep it in gear......

So here is where I'm at if anyone can help out with anything I'd be very
greatfull.......

On I-44 in Sullivan MO, over 1,000 miles (in a strait line) from home Bus
still runs, but ofcourse can't go over 40, staying at a cheap state park
campground and plenty of cheap motels in area so I'm set with that .........

I need to find a good VW shop that can help me figure out what is wrong and
get back on the road.......

I thought I was all set, the auto part store guy told me of a good vw shop
right down the street...... ofcourse he had to leave for a funeral and
nobody knows when he'll be back........

I have AAA plus so can be towed if needed, I'm about to call them see if
they have any ideas.........

Sorry for the short rambling sentences and thanks in advance for any
help...........

Tim Watson

P.S.  I'm on a cell phone laptop if anyone is curious .........
