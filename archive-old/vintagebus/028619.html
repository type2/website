The engine looks like the 356 engine, but I don't know Porsche that
well. The car it is in could have been a 356 at one time, but it has
been customized beyond easy recognition. Most of the sheet metal is
gone and replaced with fiberglass stuff. The rear wheels look like
something off an F1 race car, with big wide fenders to match. Big
spoiler on the back. I am surprised there isn't a scoop on the
front... I don't know if I would still call it a Porsche. I think the
Porsche is an attractive little car, and this isn't.

The talk of little low end torque and the possibility of the crank and
flywheel separating has me rethinking this engine swap. I just wanted
to use the engine for a little while, not destroy it. Thank you for
all the advice, it makes good sense.

Still pushing the bus myself,
Joel
