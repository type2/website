So, we still have a six-volt starter, and a small flywheel (aka
&quot;six-volt flywheel&quot;).  The only variable is the bushing.  I've
certainly seen incorrect adapter bushings being sold.  You want it to
be not-quite snug inside and out.  If it's not, then it's the wrong
bushing.  Measure the diameter of everything, and look at the
available bushings until you find one that meets the specs for what
you've got.

I've done six-volt starters in a twelve-volt bus for many years.  The
tricks required are to get the right bushing, and to make sure that
the flywheel and the gear on the starter agree on the tooth pitch.
