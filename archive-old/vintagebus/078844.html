Subject: story in New York Times

Hi Folks,
 On another site, saw a reference to a story in recent New York Times about
early split window busses and how they're value in the used and collecter car
markets
has increased markedly in the last few years. Wondered if anyone has seen it,
perhaps has a link? Or maybe has a print date of the article?
Thanks in advance,
Mike Turner
