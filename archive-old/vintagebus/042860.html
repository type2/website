Hey everyone!
Today I got up bright and early to set my mind on getting &quot;Gumbi&quot; my '65
bus running.  I had already changed the carb, dist, coil, spark plugs,
wires, and oil the day before.  I killed the battery trying to start it
though.  I have an old weak 6v battery and it wasn't turnin' it over fast
enough anyway.  So we hooked the bus up to the back of my buddy's toyota
and pull started.  The second time I popped the clutch the darn thing
started!!  I drove it around the block about three or four times.  Now all
I have to do is get the brakes working....  Driving with the e-brake is
not all that fun!  After sitting for almost 20 years I couldn't believe
how well this thing runs.
