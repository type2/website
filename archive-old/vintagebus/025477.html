In california it is very easy to register a bus with no
papers.  I have registered many busses that came
to me with no title.  Particularly if it has not been
registered for more than 5 years and out of the
DMV system.  Simply have the seller fill out the paper work
for lost title and the fact that they own
the thing.  Or you can just say you lost the title and fill
out the paperwork (bill of sale required from
the seller tho).  If out of the system, you can even say it
was yours from the start, and fill out lost title
papers and it cost you less that a good dinner to put it in
your name. To see ahead of time if it is in
the system, make a call to them with the VIN number ready.
This is a must if the seller doesn't have
a title and the tags say its late for registration.  Late
fees can add up to quite a lot.   If you call them,
you must say you own the bus, otherwise they wont do the
search.    The next step required is taking
it to the DMV office (or cop) for VIN verification and
walla! it is now yours (after paying $$ of
course..)
