hello, i am very new to the vintage bus list as i am prospectively looking at
a 58 single-cab pickup, just a few questions if i may
1. where can i find 6v batteries? i would like to restore and keep as stock as
possible. would golf cart 6v work?
2. where might i be able to find a bently or bently-esque manual, as i have
only worked on watercooled vws before.
3. is there any difference in front floor pannels between standard bus,
double-cab, and single-cab?
im sure if i get it there will be a whole lot more questions
thanks in advance
