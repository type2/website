Subject: engine won't shut off

&gt; Short answer: With some help from Matt Roberds and Ronnie, Got it all
&gt; figured out, and drove the bus for the first time yesterday evening.
&gt; Nice!
&gt;
&gt; Long Answer: Alternator is internally regulated, and I had it
&gt; connected correctly.  I had the blinkers and idiot lights connected
&gt; incorrectly at the speedo.  Once I figured all of that out,
&gt; everything works fine, except my fuel gauge because it's 6v and the
&gt; bus is now 12V.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks everyone for the help!  Now I've got to tackle all of the
&gt; crazy things I discovered once I got it on the road (adjust drag
&gt; link, brakes, accel cable sticks a bit, clutch needs to be a bit
&gt; tighter, aim headlghts).  Does it ever end?  Fun though, isn't it!
&gt;
&gt; Thanks again everybody,
&gt;
&gt; Mike A.
