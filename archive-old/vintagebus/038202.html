Not really a bus question, but I'm stumped. I was hoping someone could tell 
me(or tell me where I could find out) what vehicle a wiper motor with part # 
0 390 246 050 would come from. Ordered a thing motor(for friend even) and got 
one with this number. it looks nothing like a thing motor that I have seen, 
and seller claims to have pulled it directly from a thing. 

On a more bus related note, I just found an original paint 65 panel with 
camper windows that look like westy windows except with a squared frame and a 
little aluminum visor(for lack of a better word) over them. no interior left. 
any one know what this was?
