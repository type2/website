&gt; Anyway, it's supposed to have a H-case in it.  It appears the fuel pump
&gt; should have a threaded inlet and a slip on outlet. 
&gt; What part should I be looking for.

Hi David,
No threaded inlet.  You want a 113 127 025 A fuel pump with the VW 3 stamped
on it and the pentagon shaped top with four screws holding it on.
  Wrong fuel pump rod.
  From the look of your air cleaner rubber tube your carburetor is way too 
high.  Get rid of the spacer that should only be used with govenor tall 
intake manifold to keep the carb high enough when the govenor is removed.
     You should have the paper preheat tube going forward through the &gt; 
&gt; forward engine tin to the front of the right heat exchanger.  

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; someone already asked me if this thing should have a fuel regulator...
&gt; 
&gt; follow the link for a picture of the engine as it is now.

&gt; In the long run, what's the best reference to ensure engine correctness? 
...
&gt; not trying to be AR or anything...
