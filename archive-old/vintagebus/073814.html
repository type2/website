Subject: STOLEN 23 WINDOW
My name is Rob Bair, I was currently having a one man body shop weld some
replacement metal into my bus. Going there every weekend for about a year
I realized I had never seen anyone else in the shop. A month ago I went
to the shop which had been closed down and vacant. I can not find this guy
anywhere

My bus was a 60 23 window Primer grey and lowered. Located in the Sarasota/
Bradenton Florida area Please help Thank you Rob I want to find this sob.
