Subject: Question about tent mount
Message-Id: &lt;199907021657.JAA27452_at_web1_dot_calweb_dot_com&gt;

Does anyone have a picture of how an early westy tent is supposed
to mount at the rear?  I was just jamming mine into the hole in
the side of the bumper, which is incorrect, and I wont
want to do that when I get my bumpers all pretty.

Thanks!

Thom
