I did this in the '55.

* use the old harness to pull your fish thru the frame, back to front
* print out the diagram from my page, in color, on the largest paper
you can (I use E size)

Yours should be easier than mine, because you don't have to remove every
single connector and tin the wire - the only off-the-shelf harness WW
had was for push-on connectors,and I didn't have the time to wait for
a new one.
