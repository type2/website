Subject: Grrr,  Westfakia!

A little rant here.  If your bus is not a REAL Westfalia then do not claim
it to be one.  This ad is so darn wrong about even coming close to being a
real westfalia it is not even funny.

Just say camper conversion or westfakia or something that shows that you are
not a complete moron for thinking you own a REAL Westfalia!

As a novice buyer I would really be pissed if I bought a Westfalia and then
found out it was not a Westfalia... As a seller you could probably be sued.
