still over here in switzerland. A friend of mine here just got this new
citroen berlingo. very cool sunroof. It is like a minivan, the sunroof is like
a bus sunroof, but automatic. fun to drive in the back. but is miss my bus.

Anyway...he has this pretty cool mini bud vase, that just sticks to his
windshield(via a suction up). Suction cup to metal ring, glass vase slides
through ring. Pretty simple design.

They cost about $5, and I was going to get one for my bus, if anyone else is
interested-I could pick up a few and bring them back to the states. $5 plus
shipping.

let me know
