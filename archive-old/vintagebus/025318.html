Martin,

Well, I haven't yet learned all the names for all those parts down there
in front, but I do know mechanically what is going on down there. I
don't have a Bentley yet, but I will get one (as funds allow)! 

One of the nice things about working where I do is that I can check the
parts manuals and see how those parts fit together, and what they are
called. From what I saw, though, all I know is that I need &quot;upper pins
and bushings&quot;. 

Ok, for my info and for others out there as ignorant as me, which are
the kingpins and which are the linkpins?
