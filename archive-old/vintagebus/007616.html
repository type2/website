Subject: Steering box exchange

Since my old steering box was shot, I ordered one from Bus Boys 2 weeks
before I left on the KCMO trip and of course it didn't show up until 3 hours
before I left for KC.  Oh well.

So tonight I figured would be the night to replace it.  I got permission to
use my grandfather's shop so I went on over and he had the garage door open
for me.  I started to head for the door when I hit the brakes suddenly
remembering my roof rack and the goodies it was hauling.  I had to unload
the rack and remove the rack itself before gaining entry into the shop.

Within 45 minutes of arriving, I had the steering box removed and in the
next 2 hours had everything reinstalled.  I had to pull my belly pan and
pickle fork off the drag link and pittman arm using the fork attachment in
the pneumatic hammer.  I put in all of the lubricant that Bus Boys included
with their box and proceeded to do the install.  Everything went well.

The box seems a little tight right now but it is adjusted according to the
specs detailed in the Bentley manual.  Maybe it needs to break in so we'll
see.  I noticed an immediate increase in control and no more darting around
the roadway now that my freeplay has gone from 3 inches to about 1/2&quot; which
is pretty darn good.

Now to get that 1776 fired up and running.  Anyone want to lend me their
camcorder so I can get the break-in process recorded?  A friend of mine just
got a P800 system with a big old video card.  It's equipped to make avi's
from any video source so doing a real video type feed will not be a problem.

Anyway, the box was installed just before the local Tonic Sol Fa concert was
to begin so I did a quick change of clothing and headed out to the show.
The music was absolutely great so it was a good way to wind down the
evening.

More later...
