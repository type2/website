Subject: Full-length roof rack...
References: &lt;199808060614.XAA30133_at_yiff.azaccess_dot_com&gt;

I saw a really awesome tubular steel bus roof rack at the Volunteer Bug
Jam in Knoxville, last weekend... and this particular roof rack had a
wrinkle that not many of them do.
	The forward-most section of the roof rack was designed to serve as a
spare tire carrier, shaped accordingly in a semicircular fashion to
allow it... which produced a neat effect when &quot;added&quot; onto a rectangular
roof rack. You could say that it was &quot;kewl&quot;, but practical.
	The whole rack was very professionally done, nice clean welds and the
like. The downside was that the asking price was $750.00... too steep
for me. I just thought someone might benefit from the spare tire idea if
anyone's welding one up.
