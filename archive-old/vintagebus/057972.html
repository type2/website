&gt; I'm doing a dual circuit upgrade on my brakes for my '65. So of course I'm 
&gt; adding a &quot;T&quot; in the front to split the line from the M/C.  Where should the

Hi Chris,
On our pre-1964 buses we just position the T-fitting in mid air just above 
the MC and do a minimum of bending of the two front metal lines to reach it.  
Main thing is to make sure you keep all brake lines at least an inch away 
from any moving parts (IE clutch cable!!!).
