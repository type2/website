Subject: vintage plates


Hi all,
I know in Va you can register a vintage plate to your vehicle.  You are supposed 
to put current stickers on however.  

Also in SC you can have a different plate on the front and back. I just bought a 
 65 21 window deluxe (in great shape) that has spent the last few years of its 
life in England and was just shipped back to the US.  I will be keeping the 
English plate on the front for that vintage look.  Love those English plates.

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
