Hi,

If you need a hi temp paint just to prevent rust, try using
Rustoleum brand Zinc Rich cold galvanizing compound item
number V2185.  I sprayed some onto a piece of sheet metal
and took a propane torch to it. The paint didn't bubble,
burn, or discolor yet the metal was heated to a blue color.

I am right now testing out some Ras-O-Nil, (expensive
stuff). So far after 24 hours in a salt water bath, no rust
on the treated side of a sample of hot rolled steel. Plenty
of rust on the untreated side. I may be sold.

Chris
