Subject: Pop-out Window in Closet
Mime-Version: 1.0

I am trying to replace the seal on the pop out(as opposed to crankout) window that is in my closet.  I have gotten all but two screws out of the hinge that holds the glass frame to the body. Those last two are stuck, I've tried liquid wrench, and WD-40 to no avail. An impact driver is impractical, as it would probably tear the hinge right off, as it is just a thin piece of steel.

Am I going to have to drill it out? Then spend forever looking for the right screw to go back there.
