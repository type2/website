Subject: [VB] Gas door and bumper overriders

Two questions for the mighty list -

I have a gas flap door with the church key setup, but the latch just
spins around.  Looks like there should be a hole that looks something
like a circle with the top and bottom flattened, but the lock just
twists every time I turn it.  Tried to take it off today, but could not
figure out how to.  I don't have the key, and the lock itself is pretty
much destroyed.  Should I trade it for a gas door with the correct
(non-rounded out) opening?  I have a keyed lock that will fit in the
opening.  The only bad part is that the lock is not protected from the
weather, similar to the door locks, so I'm not too worried about that.
Anyone wanna trade?  The door itself is in pretty good shape.

Second, how would I know if my front bumper &quot;used&quot; to have overriders?
This weekend when I was removing it for stripping and por-15, I noticed
there were at least four holes in the top of the bumper.  Two on the
outer-most edges, and two closer in to the middle, with two more
matching holes underneath the middle ones.  It certainly appears to be
the mounting points for the overriders.  Could overriders be attached as
a dealer option?  Or were the US spec bumpers (ie with the overriders)
required from a certain year?  I thought Pick-ups and other
commercial-type vehicles didn't get overriders?

One more thing, to clarify.  I recently spoke to the original owner of
my Crew cab, and he informed me that it had all white knobs *except* for
the steering wheel - that was black.  He could not remember of it had
&quot;the extra bumper attached to the main one.&quot;  He thought it might have,
but he was going to find some old pictures of it and send them to me.

Thanks for reading!
