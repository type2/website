Subject: Re: [VB] Buying bus parts

first: sure, technical help is part of the job, but not the sole job or
responsibility of the vendor. one of the absoulte WORST things i can
remember about working parts/phone was the occasional customer that called
every 10 minutes and discussed the problems they were having, and how what
i (or others) had suggested didn't magically fix the problem. sometimes
fixing something over the phone is like calling the doctor and saying &quot;i'm
sick...what's wrong with me?&quot;-just not realistic.
yes, some assistance is ok, and is usually gonna happen during normal
talking, but to talk someone through a detailed or precision job isn't
good, and again can get the person working in more trouble than they
started with.

second: good point about the website for advertisement purposes.
third: and very true about customers letting you know about high prices! it
happens. and if you are low on something, customers tell their friends!

&gt; [Original Message]
&gt; &gt; first: if you don't know what a part looks like or what it's called, why
&gt; &gt; are you even working on the car in the first place?

&gt; If you are not willing to help the public out then you are either a
&gt; wholesaler only or you will be going out of business.  Technical help is
&gt; part of the job.

&gt; &gt; second: not all shops want the hassle of dealing with both
&gt; &gt; in-person-at-counter and phone AND internet. not all shops have the
extra
&gt; &gt; time to deal with the web and maintaining a website
&gt; 
 Anyway, if you have a website and only want it as an
&gt; advertisement and not as a means of communication then state how you want
to
&gt; be contacted and when, including time zone.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; third: YEAH RIGHT! if every shop had the time to devote to knowing what
&gt; all
&gt; &gt; their competitors were selling stuff for, nothing else could be
&gt; accomplished.
&gt; 
&gt; I'll agree with you here.  Your customers will tell you when you are too
&gt; high.  I think you need to have a general idea but in the end you have to
&gt; price off of your overhead, not theirs.
