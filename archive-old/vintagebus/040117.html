&gt;Thanks to the one person who gave me advice on spare parts for a long
&gt;trip. I could really use some help here.

Does the sundial (I dont know, Im a westy guy) have a roof rack? Can you get 
one?

I would get some way of securring things up top. Then add these things;

Clutch plate, tranny oil, coil, jack, a piece of plywood, brakes, brake 
fluid, slave brake cylinder, and a spare master, and heres the kicker: 3 
spare tires, a small air pump, and fix a flat.
From what I understand some of the roads are real nightmares on tires. Be 
prepared. Get an alignment before going.

Jason
