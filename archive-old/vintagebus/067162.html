Subject: Re: [VB] Angle of Dangle

Agreed. Some experience I had. I'll back you up for sure Ronnie.

&gt;A split BUS(not a bug, which does have more preload and is dangerous) spring
&gt;plate does not have the preload. 20 degrees is less than an inch below the
&gt;lower stop, meaning in stock position the plate when pried off the lower
&gt;stop will swing down less than an inch, I have a hard time beliving there
&gt;would be much difference from bus to bus.  I used a prybar to pull it off
&gt;the stop(if you look in your bently you'll see the same thing, doubt they
&gt;would do that with a dangerous preload) and a jack to lift it up. I didn't
&gt;use a chain and I wasn't EXTRA careful, or lucky. There just wasn't any
&gt;danger. No more so than anytime you have a vehicle on jack stands.
