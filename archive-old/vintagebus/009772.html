Thanks for doing the math.  Not that I understand it fully, but the concept
is clear.  Several things you've mentioned I did come up with answers to:

In the brochures and websites, radiant heating can be used with both wood
and concrete.  The systems and tubing have been updated, and are
theoretically leak-resistant.  Obviously, true flexibility and reliable
joints (minimized, of course) would be a key to the longetivity of a
leak-free system.
&gt;
&gt; Isn't radiant heating usually installed in a concrete floor?  I.
&gt; A car is not the best environment for flexible tubing with joints
&gt; in it, either.  A house A/C will often have its original refrigerant
&gt; charge 30 years later; put a similar A/C system in a car, with
&gt; vibration rattling the joints, and 7 to 10 years later, the system
&gt; is one big leak.

Yes, I agree about protecting the tubing from road debris...that would
happen naturally, because the insulation you'd have to put UNDERNEATH the
tubing to minimize loss of heat to the atmosphere would have to be
non-moisture-trapping and tough.

&gt; You'd have to protect the tubing from road debris, maybe by using
&gt; a &quot;belly pan&quot; such as is found on double-door Buses.

I didn't think of the brake line thing, but that &quot;shouldn't&quot; be too much of
an issue if addressed logically.

&gt; You'd want to insulate the brake line that runs from front to rear
&gt; a little bit, to keep it from getting *too* hot.

The modern systems do use pressurized water circulated by a pump.  I don't
know what the pressure in the lines is, nor do I know how much electrical
energy would be required to move the fluid.  About the issue of whether the
vehicle is level or not:  This idea is for camping, etc, and I'm sure (don't
ask me why) that most of us park on relatively level surfaces when we camp.
This is NOT a replacement for a good, tight stock heater when underway!

&gt; If radiant systems use pressurized water circulated by a pump,
&gt; it would work OK.  If they are more like the old radiator systems,
&gt; they may not like not being level, as will happen often in a
&gt; moving vehicle.

I say (presumably) well-insulated interior because I'll soon have all new
seals, and the insulation in the panels and roof is to be upgraded....any
suggestions?  I'll probably use that space-age bubble stuff...

&gt; &gt;however, how much energy would be consumed to heat a (presumably)
&gt; &gt;well-insulated bus interior?
&gt;
&gt; If it was well-insulated, even the stock system would do better...

Another possibility is that the tubing could be inside the bus!  If one
could get a hold of this leak-free, flexible tubing in a FLATTENED shape to
maximize heat transfer (same theory as in oil coolers: flat, not round), it
could fit in the grooves in the floor underneath the plywood or whatever
that is a typical camper floor.  I do not think that attempting to heat
underneath the rear cushion would be very successful, as the rear cushion
would insulate, and you'd feel very little of the heat.  Again, insulation
underneath the floor of the bus would be vital.  Heating the sides is also
an option/addition.  The insulative material could be placed next to the
skin of the panels, with the tubing running right next to the interior wood
(or whatever you're using.)

Here's my biggest problem, besides finding the magickal tubing, the
efficient boiler/pump unit that is small enough to be useful:  How does one
route the tubing back and forth without cutting any of the venerable frame
metal that is our bus?

And one more question:  What did the Apollo mission capsules use for heat?
It had to be really efficient, right?  And its COLD out there!!

Gene

&gt; Let's follow along on a physics adventure...
&gt;
&gt; Assumptions:
&gt;  perfect heat transfer to the air inside the Bus
&gt;  no heat is lost to the sheet metal, outside, etc.
&gt;  we are just heating the back of the bus (I estimate that
&gt;    heating the whole bus would add 1 to 2 luggage compartments
&gt;    to these figures - about a 15% to 30% increase)
&gt;  no seats, luggage, equipment, etc in the back of the Bus

&gt;
&gt; This is pretty good.  Heating up air is easy.  Now let's throw a
&gt; wrinkle into it...
&gt;
&gt; Let's assume that you wanted to heat the walls of the Bus, too.
&gt; Assume one layer of sheet metal, 1 mm thick, is to be heated.
&gt; Assume no windows, as this calculation is pretty far out already.  :)
