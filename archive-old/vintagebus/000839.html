Hello All,
		Well I finally got my heads hemi-cut &amp; spaced out my cylinders.....Now I
have my compression ratio down to a reasonable 7.4:1...My dillema is this:
After reinstalling the engine, I cranked her up and she is idleing very very
low.  This was never a problem when the ratio was astronomically high
(8.9:1)... When you shim out the cylinders, does this affect other things
like timing or air/fuel mixture requirments??  I am asuming that it does
 at least the carb adjustment).   My next question is does anyone know how
to tune a weber progressive?  My previous experience is with stock carbs
only.  The adjustment screws are in the back making it not so inviting to
tune.  I've heard all the bad news about the webers', but it's all I have at
the moment except for an old holly bugspray that I just rebuilt (and am not
sure about taking it off the shelf).  The engine is an 1835cc, Dual QP
exhaust............Any and all responses are appreciated.....Thanks
