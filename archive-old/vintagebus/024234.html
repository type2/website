Subject: bus trany

Ok heres the deal, the PPO put a 1600 upright engine in the 76 bus I
have, and not being a engine fellow, I have no desire to try and make it
go, as it was mostly striped when I got it, dont worry the bus is in
great shape body wise and it was a really good price, so I am looking at
getting a 2.0 liter pancake engine for it but I need to know how to
figure out what transmition I have and if it will work with the new
engine, Or I will see about getting an engine and transmition together
from a differnt place out of a mid 70's westy, being on a tight budget
for this I am wanting to only have to do this once and do it right the
first time, and as the engien and the tranny together are cheaper than
they are if I buy them one at a time I want to find out ahead of time if
I need the tranny or not.
any information on how to identify with out haivng to pull them engine
what I have and  what I will need would be greatly appreciated.
