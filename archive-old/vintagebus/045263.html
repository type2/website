Hi Dan and list,

Has anyone out there had any luck having parts rechromed?  I can't find anyone
who will do my door handles and a few other bits.  I assume they will have to
be done in copper first because of pitting.  Are there any places that you can
send chrome out to through the mail?  How much should I reasonably pay?

I've had pretty good luck having large quantities of parts chromed. Most
companies will give you a better price doing a few items at a time, rather
than one at a time.
Door handles are fairly common to get done, and most chrome shops will know
what to do with the pitting. 
You can send some things through the mail, especially door handles. Check the
yellow pages in your area and always check out the work they've done before
having them do your parts.
I'd say $50 for a pair of door handles would be the maximum you should pay,
and that might even be a little high. Of course it always depends on where you
go.

Good luck
