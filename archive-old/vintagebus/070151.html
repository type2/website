Hi JT,
Yes, 46mm axle nuts were used in 1964-67 buses.  Check your front brakes for 
size/year and if still the early type best to install a 1964-67 front beam 
for 20% bigger brakes and less chance for spinouts when panic stopping on wet 
or icy conditions.

Probably best to install all new ball bearings and only use the old lower 
outer rooler bearing if they are in perfect shape as these seem to last 
forever as long as they are not damage by exploding ball bearings nearby.  
Then carefully clean &amp; inspect all the ball bearings for any chips in the 
outer and inner races while keeping an eye out for any damage to the balls at 
the same time.  Then if they are perfect shape use them for spares for when 
only one ball bearing goes out and you catch it quickly before everything 
gets damaged or when you have amassed a pefect set of used ball bearings to 
fill a RGB.  Otherwise only use new replacement ball bearings together.
