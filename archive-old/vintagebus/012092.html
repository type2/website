Subject: re:Horn
Mime-Version: 1.0

Well, I ordered a new horn on monday, and just got it today(from Wolfsberg West).

The horn is definietly different looking, and it is made in Mexico.  I also ordered new horn wire rubber boots.  It looks like these boots won't neccesarily atttach to the new horn, like they would have with the old Horn.

Any suggestions?
