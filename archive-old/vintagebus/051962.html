I have to chime in and say that I have seen good and bad.  The good?  Jon R.
and I just completed a trade of interiors (camper for non-camper) that went
as smooth as could be.  We have never met and we both had a lot to loose by
putting our stuff on a truck for each coast.  It cost us nothing but some $
for shipping and we really enjoyed working &quot;the deal&quot;.  As I said, Jon and I
have never met but we are fast friends because of this list and our VW's.
Thanks Jon!  Another list member and I, Bob M., got together this past
summer for a deal also...nothing but positive.  The bad?  Flames and egos I
guess but the community is strong and full of great people.  My thanks to
all of you!
Continuing to learn from you all...
