Subject: Selling my 58 panel - The list gets first dibs

Fellow VB listees.

I am selling my 58 panel in favor of a 62 SC.  I thought since you folks have
been very helpful in me getting it more road worthy, I would offer it to the
list first before I do the ebay, paper, smaba routes.  First, here is a link
to all the pics I have of it on the samba...

Now the details,

58 panel van.
1600 DP
recently rebuilt trans. Not sure what year.
Still has the reduction gears.
Strong runner (aren't they all!)
Interior is in good shape, uncut dash (nope, have not put the gas guage in
yet)
It currently has vinyl graphics on it, but those can be easily removed.  I
will sell it with or without them.  Also has a custom rear cabinet and three
compartment sink with a habdwashing sink that was designed for a mobile
espresso setup.  NO holes were made in the installation of this equipment with
the exception of 2 small holes in the left cargo door cross member for
mounting.  Nothing a quick spot weld would not fix.

Asking $5000.
Located in Spokane, Washington
Would consider delivery within the eastern half of the state and parts of
Idaho.

If intersted, contact me off list.  Thanks.
