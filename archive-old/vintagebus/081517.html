Subject: Re: [VB] Speaker location, Doors?

----- Original Message ----- 
&gt; Anyone have speakers mounted in the front doors? Any problems with this?
How
&gt; about running the wires across the hinge area?

I've always mounted mine in the doors. You have to mount them fairly low to
clear the door structure (take the door panel off, and you'll see where
there is room to do it). Generally a 6 1/2&quot; is about as big as you're going
to fit in there, there isn't a whole lot of depth to clear the housing and
magnet. Since the speaker sits fairly low, I prefer to get 6 1/2&quot; seperates
so that I can mount the tweeter up higher in the door so I still get crystal
clear sound. It will be muffled by yours and your passengers legs otherwise.

As for the wires, I just run them from the edge of the door panel over to
the dash. Leave enough slack so that the doors can open fully without
tugging on the wires. They look a bit out of place at first, but after a
while you don't even notice them anymore.
