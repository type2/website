Jon,

I'm sure I'll get flamed for this, but in my experience, the best thing to do
is go and buy a NEW  one!   You will expend lots and lots of time and energy
rebuilding, testing, and generally dicking around with the old one just to get
it right...maybe.

I've learned this lesson on everything from jet skis to VWs and with out
exception, as soon as I slap on the new unit, the problems disappear.

Of course you can fix the one you have, especially if it is a rare carb (like a
cog logo'd carb for a split window KDF car), but my personal experience is
you'll be driving sooner if you buy a new one.

&gt; The topic says it all.  I am about to give up on this carb.  A 34PICT3 on a
&gt; 1600dp w/009 that checks out O.K. but just won't idle.  I've tried
&gt; everything I can think of ( I'm NOT a carb specialist) and have had no luck.
&gt; The engine fires right up and will rev up great but the second I let off the
&gt; gas, it dies.  I have checked the idle cut off and it is O.K. I even tried
&gt; one from another carb that is running fine on my baja, still no idle.
&gt; So........
&gt;
&gt; HELP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
