&gt; &gt; Black plates, sure, if you have the correct plate and sticker to go

&gt; 
&gt; Nope.

Thanks for setting me straight!

There is _one_ other way of getting black-and-yellow plates on a car of
any vintage.  All you have to do is be a ham radio operator who has a
set of black-and-yellow callsign plates.  These plates can be placed on
any vehicle you might wish to put them on.  An older fellow in my radio
club has a beautiful set on his '96 ovloV!  He gets pulled over about
once every two months to explain the situation to a not-up-to-speed
deputy or chp fellow.  They're legal, they're valid, they're just old!

You might be able to do the same thing with press photographer plates,
but I'm not all that familiar with them.
