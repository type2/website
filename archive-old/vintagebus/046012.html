while.
 
 I would love to make it stop leaking if I could only find the stuff to do it.
  &gt;&gt;


What I would do, in the interests of wanting to avoid muchos work and money 
expenditure.

get a spray botle of simple green.  crawl under bus and spray liberally at 
tranny.  (at least it is biodegradable and has a pleasant smell, good at 
getting out the grease- works better with some time to penetrate if you are 
getting something really gooky) an hour or so later  drive to the self 
service car wash in grubbies.  use their high pressure washer to knock all 
that slime off the tranny.  (how's your engine compartment - watch out for 
the paper hoses)  Now hopefully the tranny is cleaner , and you are probably 
wearing some of that.

go home, then climb under neath and look, can you tell?

tranny boots?  easier to replace  Some time it leaks around the ends of the 
boots, and tightening the screw helps.

there are a bunch of 13mm nuts around the flange holding the axle tube on, it 
it leaking around that joint?  or around the joint where the side covers are? 
 that is the next ring on the side

a tunnel case tranny is divided from front to back in several section.  you 
have the main case, then a seam wher ethe gears are, then the nose cone,  is 
it leaking from those seam?  how about from the front of the nose cone if the 
seal in there is bad?

so if your boots are torn or cracked, replace them.   

If it is leaking from a seam, check the nuts, they should be 18ft lbs if I 
remember right, but do NOT over torque them.  

you can't replace the nose cone seal w/o removing the tranny.    

I have seen a nose cone be cracked by too much driving with the tarnny mounts 
broken.  Of course this also bent the hockey stick and broke the front holder 
for the front shift rod.   Jb weld could help in a pinch on cracks.

hope this helps.
