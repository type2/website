Morning list

I am dazed and confused. Was up until 3 this morning putting the wiring
back into my '61 right hand drive double cab. Everything worked fine
except for the flashers(indicators). On disassembly of the bus I
recorded the positions and colour coding of every wire I so much as
looked at, then feeling smug I cut everything off.

Problem is the wires that get soldered onto the indicator stalk(six of
the little bastards) seem to have changed colour all on their own while
in the panel shop. OK that's not true I obviously made a mistake while
recording the stuff.

did you take the wires off the indicators?  you cut them?  why?
=============
Three of the positions are correct(green/white , green , yellow) as the
colours are bright and little stubs of wire remained on the stalk
assembly. I therefore have three wires that I'm unsure about.

I have three questions for the moment:

(1) Can the flasher unit be burned out if the connections at the stalk
are wrong?( I tried a couple of combinations     so far without
success).
(2) Is there a way to test whether the flasher is still functional?
(3)Is there a routine for determining the positions of the of the three
uncertain wires on the stalk?

 You can check power comming out of the flasher unit with a test light.

&gt;from ch# 614 456 (8 fuses in fuse block) to ?  end of 61?

&gt;from the turn signal switch the
black/green/white wire goes to the blinker box (power)   at possibly the same
terminal the blue wire that leads up to the blinker indicator on the speedo.


there is also a black/green/white wire leading to the blinker box from the
second to right fuse (power on w/key)

also from indicator switch:

black/white - to front left - through connector to another wire (?)
black/green- to front right-  &quot;&quot;&quot;
black/red- to  brake MC switch
black/orange (red?)- to R rear   (connects to other wire that leads from the
underdash area)
black/yellow-  to L rear   (&quot;&quot;&quot;)

I have hooked up a turn signal switch to a battery charger and a test light
and turned the switch to check if power comes out .
