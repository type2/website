Subject: RE: [VB]  Cheap Taiwan/China parts screw me!!!


&gt; ...or the outrageous price
&gt; for a correct pulley for a 38amp 68-71 bus style generator.

I have a '71, which came equipped with the 38A generator.  The belt was straight with what I assume is the original 38A pulley.  I 
converted to an alternator and used the same pulley.  The belt is still straight.  What'd the difference in the exotic 38A pulley?  From what 
I can see, the extra length of the 38A generator was compensated for in the front (FIF) end with different tin, not in the pulley end.  The 
38A pulley seems to be exactly the same as the 30A setup in our bug.

I agree that used German parts are better than new anything else.
