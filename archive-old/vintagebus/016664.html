Indeed, but I recently had an experience the other way.  I've got a
1960 Neunsitzer that was in storage for 27 years (10 in good
conditions, 17 in a barn).  It has been repainted once a very long
time ago, there's surface rust in the obvious places (under the window
gaskets, around the tank), and there are small rust-throughs in the
front wheel wells.  It's in amazing shape for something from the
Boston area (it was used as a farm vehicle).  It has roughly 31,000
original miles (actually less, because the speedometer/odometer read
about a third again above actual speed/distance - gotta get that
fixed).

In any case, I had someone put a &quot;are you interested in selling&quot; note
on it the other day.  I'm not, but thought I'd be nice and tell him
so, rather than just ignore it.  We eventually got around to the
subject of how much I'd spent for it, and he expressed complete
disbelief that it was $5,000, and that I'd blue-booked it (well,
antique-vehicle'd it) at $12,000 - $20,000.  Now, this bus is in the
best shape I've ever seen in an unrestored vehicle, so $5,000 seemed
fair to me.  This guy claimed that he buys and sells VWs all the time
in the area, and he's never gone anywhere near that much for one.  My
suspicion is that he was trying to convince me to lower the price
(which I wasn't going to do, because I wasn't going to sell it
anyway).

The question is, which of us is hallucinating?  I'm in northern
Colorado, FWIW.
