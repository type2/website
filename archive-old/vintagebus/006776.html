Talk about a deal, a fellow from Nevada came up to me and showed me some
pictures of a 1960 single cab he had just gotten and wanted to know the
approx. value. As I told him what I thought not knowing the true condition I
asked him what he was going to do with it and was told probally going to
sell it, he needed the money as he got it in trade for repairing a guys
sewer line but would of rather had the cash!!!!.

what was that saying?  turning sh#t into gold!
