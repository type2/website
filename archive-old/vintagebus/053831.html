&gt;
&gt;hello everyone,
&gt;
&gt;john doe - i just finished washing the crap out of my bus, ...  my arms are
&gt;tired - but i'm happy, all at the same time.
&gt;
&gt;joe schmoe - why did you just do all that work?
&gt;
&gt;john doe - well b/c tomorrow (sunday) is our first big event and it's going
&gt;to be a blast.
&gt;
&gt;joe schmoe - what kinda stuff will be going on?
&gt;
&gt;john doe - let's see... there's going to be a FREE car show, a swap meet, a
&gt;bluegrass band, prizes, food, beer, happy smiling people, t-shirts and a
&gt;raffle for a some dual carbs... and the raffle tickets are only $10 for
&gt;1 --- or 2 for $20 with a free t-shirt!!!  the t-shirts are the coolest
&gt;thing i've ever seen and the people are super friendly and always by me free
&gt;drinks.
&gt;
&gt;joe schmoe - but isn't it going to rain tomAAAAAAGHGHG... *gurgle gurgle*
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;and remember folks --- registration is from 10-12 but there might be a huge
&gt;turnout so i'd get there closer to 10 to get parked, i guess that's about
&gt;it.... oh yeah, one more thing... bring your knives in case we get some
&gt;smack talkers.

Located in the parking lot of Mangia Pizza on West 6th, across from Deep
Eddy Cabaret. If ya'll ain't from here, its easy to get to - just go down
West 6th  from downtown  :)

I'll be there w/ a van FULL of stuff - mostly Bug parts, tho.
