Subject: RE: [VB] Headlight switch repair

Hey,


I wrote:

&gt;&gt;I need to bypass the 'dimmer', as my dash lights like to stay on even with
the swith off.(no grin)

OK.  I think I got this one figured.  The copper 'arm' that rides the
rheostat had managed to get itself tweaked, after all of the times I had
been pulling the whole business apart.  I massaged &amp; coaxed the 'arm' back
to a resonably straight form, and the dimmer seems to be behaving itself.
