&gt; Have you or anyone ever tried Muir's suggestion for oil-soaked brake
&gt; shoes (soak them in Coleman fuel, place on hard level surface, light
&gt; fuse, get away)? 
..............

Ya, BTDT, cheaper than brake cleaner.  
except I used gasoline. let it soak in a oil drain bucket a bit.  remove from bucket, which is plastic and would probably melt.  You can hold the shoe with a pair of vise grips while it burns.   Gasoline is not as explosive as the movies imply.   but tie hair back.

&gt; &gt;It was a lovely clean new disc and 9 spring clutch, too.

&gt; Wait... you're trying to say your Bus _didn't_ love grease?

...................
so true,
 I guess for everything there is a time and a place, and your clutch (or mine, to be more (specific) 
does not love grease.   nor oil.  do not oil your clutch every tuneup.
