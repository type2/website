Subject: Re:  [VB] 40hp cam plug
To: SinisterPhunk_at_aol_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

 late 60 bus parts lists shows 
111 101 157  end plug- cam shaft-   25,30 bhp
113 101 157          ditto     27.4mm dia            -- up to engine 9 800 
000     34 bhp
113 101 157 C     ditto       29.9mm dia       --   from engine # D 0 000 001 
 

so it looks like you want the 27.4mm one and you have the 29.9mm?
= =  = == == = 

does anyone know where i can get a cam plug to fit an early 40hp case?  i 
thought they were the same as 1600's but the ones i have dont fit.  all the 
places ive checked only carry one, and i know that would be for the 1600's.  
or if anyone even has a usable one and wants to part with it, ill buy it.  
any help is appreciated.  also, could you still get a bus in 65 with a 
1200cc, or were they all 1500's by then?  
thanks,
josh
