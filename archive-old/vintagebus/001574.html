Hi All,

I just purchased a Mag supercharger (made in Switzerland in the 50's) for my
58 ghia vert.  The kit was originally for a sedan so I'm looking for a few
of the ducting pieces that are different for the ghia... I know this is a
very rare item so I'm posting my plea out to as many different VW types as I
can think about just in case some one has a piece just lying around or knows
of someone that does :-)  .

(bus content:)
Actually, I was surprised to see that this kit could also be used in a type2
without cutting or hacking any of metal unlike the Judson kit!!!  I could
post pictures if people would like.
