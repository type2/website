Subject: Early type 1 alternator bearing failure and a Friday Funny

Has anyone noticed rapid failure of the front bearing of Brasilian Bosch
type 1 alternators?  I had one go bad and my girls' music instructor had
the same thing happen recently.  Both alternators were brand new with only
a few hundred miles on them.  Symptoms are similar to a loose or cracked
fan.  If you reach around and move the fan up and down you can see the
pulley tilt slightly.


Friday Funny:

If you've ever cussed at the PO of your bus for the insults that he
inflicted on your baby, just be glad that he didn't treat it like this:
