Interesting. I used to buy about 50 of each a year, all Sachs brand, and
never got a tool in an aircooled kit, 180mm, or either of the 200mm upright
sizes, or even the 215mm bay bus one....??? Maybe someone was pulling them
out cuz they knew we were a pro shop and had our own alignment tools...but
why only the aircooled?

Or maybe Ron Salmon is the kind of stand up guy that makes sure he slips a
tool into the ones that come without???

Although often I did get the plates and discs seperately.....hmmm

Well, anyways, the gist is that you can get an alignment tool most likely
from any shop that regiularly works on vanagons or bay buses, it aint a
split-specialty tool...


&gt; As to the vanagon kits coming with these and the air cooled not, i must
&gt; disagree.
&gt;
&gt; i got a clutch kit from the bus depot in august, and it came with an
alignment
&gt; tool.(little plastic thing star shaped, tube-like
