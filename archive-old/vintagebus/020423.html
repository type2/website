&gt;    Based off the evaluation by BBT, the van was far
&gt; too rusty to repair or restore.   This included the
&gt; rockers, frame, roof (yes, the cab and rear hatch
&gt; area still had the roof section) and the areas
&gt; around where the vending windows were.  (that is why
&gt; the windows were not in place)
&gt; 


But it was in good enough shape to try to sell to
someone, and then when no one bought it, place blame
because &quot;he&quot; had to cut it up?
 Mike
