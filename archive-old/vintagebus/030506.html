&gt;
&gt; You think you would use the benevolent nature of the list to key you in on a reputable
&gt; shop to tune your
&gt; double-door barndoor kombi/deluxes before you EXPORT them to the Empirial motherland?
&gt;
&gt; NOT SO FAST!
&gt;
&gt; I bet those Pearl Harbor-bombing &quot;neighbors&quot; would love to have their hands on one of
&gt; those!
&gt;
&gt; Don't be fooled folks, Keep the busses here where they belong!!!

&gt; &gt; Anyone know a good VW repair shop in Long Beach?
&gt; &gt; Please
&gt; &gt;

JEEPERS H. TRIKES Jason!  Calm down.

I am an instructor at Long Beach City College and the start of every semester is like an
international linguistics class, learning how to properly pronounce all of my students
names.  Its very rare that I get a John or Jason.  Satoshi is more the norm.  I have a
morning Electronics class of 16 students.  7 are from Cambodia, 5 are from various other
widely flung locations, 3 US Miscellaneous and then there's Bob.

Take the request at its face value unless experience dictates otherwise.

In keeping with bus content, a great VW place is
Jim's Auto Repair
5217 Cherry Ave
Long Beach CA
562-428-4968

I had been talking with Jim as I was working on my double cab.  He has both a '67 and a
late 80's DC.  Wouldn't you know it, but two days after I get my truck back on the road,
I was on my way by to &quot;show off&quot; as he requested and my fuel line broke 1/2 block before
his shop.  He handed me the tools, replacement FI line and away I went to work.  Charged
me all of $3 for the line.  FYI, since I was using a 75 psi fuel pump, I put in high
pressure fuel lines and AN fittings.  The first connection that I made up had been
pinched during assembly and scored the inside.  I ran the engine on the test stand for a
number of hours using the hose with no problem.  In the engine compartment and being
heated up, the hose balloned and popped.  Yes, I had a 10lb fire extinguisher right by
the drivers side door.

Scott.

BTW,  all of the &quot;bus snatchers&quot; that I have run into around here, have been coming from
the Torrance &amp; Carson areas.
