&gt;&gt; On the subject of cleaning intake manifold heat risers - do you often
&gt;&gt; find that one heat riser is more plugged than the other?
&gt;
&gt;Which side does the exhaust come in? (I forget)

I'm not sure what you mean here.  I thought it came in on both sides.
I have a heat riser on either side of the carb pedestal, and each one
goes down to a small flange near the rear cylinder exhaust port on
the heads.  These flanges bolt to mating flanges on the intake side
of the muffler.  I thought each heat riser was a closed-off tube -
just a &quot;dead end&quot; for some hot exhaust to hang out in.
