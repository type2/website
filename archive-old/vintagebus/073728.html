&gt; What do you think ?

I think that unless you route the exhaust a safe distance away, you run
the risk of carbon monoxide contamination in the supplied air setup. 
Still, it might work.  How would you adapt the hose to the tin? 
Oh...wait, I know.  Use a late model beetle fan shroud that has the 1/2
inch nipple (located on the top right edge of the shroud) brazed on it. 
Never could figure out what that was for.  I have one running on my 1600
SP in the 62 DC.  I just capped it off.  Some day I'll cut it (the tube)
off and weld it up.

Just for continuity, I hope you're running a bus muffler on it ;-)
