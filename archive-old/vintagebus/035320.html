Parting out 64 sundial camper.
Nothing exiting.

Complete interior
Bumpers
4-14&quot; bus rims
rear apron
front bumper blade
complete rear bumper
trans complete of unknown condition
front beam complete
headlights
taillights
roof
turn signals
turn signal switch
popout windows
front doors
decklid
cargo doors
outside door handles
cargo door handles
rear hatch
front glass
speedo
steering wheel


Everything is CHEAP.
Cheaper when you come help butcher bus.
Located 1 hour north of Los Angeles.
Will not ship anything larger than a steering wheel.
And I SUCK when it comes to shipping (SLOW).
No pictures of anything.

Thanks-
Greg
