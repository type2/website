Help, please?

I want to disassemble an old swing axle beetle transmission. I intend to cut
off the portion of the bell housing that holds the starter, the ultimate
purpose being able to connect a starter to an engine on a test bench. I'm sure
many of you have done this.

The problem is that, although I've removed every bolt/nut in sight, the unit
won't separate. No c-clip or similar retaining gadget is visible. I'm
considering brisk use of a sawzall.

I would appreciate any suggestions as to how to proceed.

Woody
