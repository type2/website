Im having a problem with my motor hope someone can help									   	around
town it drives fine but when I get on the freeway at 50  the engine starts
to cut out and jerk like the nose cone is gone       	but that isnt it. 
This only happens when I go up hills and I have lots of gas and a new fuel
pump.  Could it be caca in the fuel    	tank?  Oh the fuel filter is new
too.     what gives man?     HELP  								    							Thanks  Rick
