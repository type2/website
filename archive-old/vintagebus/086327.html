Subject: Re: [VB] fixing a door with bad lower hinge

 &quot;Hi Dave,
You need to look up in the 1963-67 Transporter Workshop Manual for the repair proceedure for that problem.  Unfortunately it was a common problem, especially if one did not keep the mechanism that held the door open lubed up.
Eric&amp;Barb &quot;
 
Can you give me a brief idea what the Workshop book says , I do not have one and  I would like to try and fix it soon
 
thanks
 
Dave
