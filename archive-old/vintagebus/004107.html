Woohoo! I removed the ignition switch and replaced/cleaned/sanded all the terminals - that didn't fix the problem (but was in need for that anyway). Then I removed that relay/solenoid thing from the starter, replaced/cleaned/sanded all terminals there and then rewired like it should be (per wiring diagram - no relay). And it works!

Thanks for all the suggestions and help! Now I can put that big screwdriver back in the toolbox and hopefully not need to crawl under there to start it anymore :-)
