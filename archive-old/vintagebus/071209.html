Subject: Re: [VB] Clutch Cable Question

Having just gone through a clutch problem recently on a friend's bus, I
thought I should mention this:

With a new TO bearing, and new forks, new cable, properly adjusted, we still
had extreme problems shifting, especially into lower gears.  The reason for
this turned out to be that the ends of the arms on the pressure plate were
very worn on two of them, and so when the clutch was activated, the release
thingy was tilting to one side, as opposed to being pushed straight in.
After finding this, and replacing the pressure plate, shifting got way
better, but not as good as it once was, due to the damage to the syncros
that E&amp;B mentioned.  Check it out ASAP!

Also, we noticed that the forks/TO bearing were not perfectly centered in
relation to the input shaft.  Thinking that this was the main problem, it
was brought to our attention that 2 or 3 other trannys we had available to
look at were similar in offset.  We managed to shim it, but later had a
problem with the circlip coming out of the groove on the aftermarket TO fork
shaft.  I don't remember which brand it was, but the groove was &quot;less than.&quot;
The actual forks weren't welded all the way around the shaft, either.
Strange....I thought everybody did that these days!  Check for those details
if you find yourself in the market for a new TO shaft/bearing setup!

&gt; &gt; Seems like it loosens up after a couple of months of driving and
shifting
&gt; &gt; to R, 1
&gt; &gt; and 2 gets difficult.
