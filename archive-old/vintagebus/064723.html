Subject: Screen Print Woes?

You are right, Taylor. I apologize for any rabbit holes you got stuck in.  The 
one I listed is not the one I use. Here's the home page of the GOOD one, 
www.geocities_dot_com/~gigaman . It's PrintKey2000 by Alfred Bolliger, Switzerland. 
We use it at work on hundreds of PC's to capture all kinds of images.

&gt; I tried downloading and working with the program Harry 
 recommended.  Nightmare for me...no idea why.  But I found a totally free 
 and small program simply called ScreenGrab.  Very basic...but that's how we 
 love it!
