&gt;It's even stated in the Bently manual that 10w30 oil is rated &quot;All the
&gt;year&quot;. The only thing thicker that they recommend is 30w, but only in
&gt;temps of 86 degrees farenheit or higher.

On page S-2 9 of the '63-'67 Bentley this recommendation is indeed made,
but _only for the 40 hp engine_.  For a 1500 they say SAE 30 above 32 F.

&gt;Most rubber oil lines are rated to take 300psi (at least, mine have
&gt;always been), so why does the valve open at about 60psi?

I understand your point, but stock VW engines and most stock engines
from other makes don't have rubber lines in their engine oiling system.
