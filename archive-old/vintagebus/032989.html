Hi Dave,
Thanks for the correction.  The 1959 panel we have has no M-code plate behind
the front bench seat only the chassi # stamped in the divider.  Also had gone
off memory about the plate on the fresh air vent.  Opps, you know what they
say about memory, that it is the first to go!  Thanks again, Eric &amp; Barb
