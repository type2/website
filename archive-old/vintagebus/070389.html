I second that no easy out!!!! 

I prefer the penetrating oil &amp; banging method myself... use a screwdriver or 
impact driver, and give it a few whacks every day for a week, spinkling 
liquid wrench like holy water (as per Muir).   with impact, sometimes to 
drive it forward, sometimes back.   With buses from non rusty areas you 
generally can remove the screwbolts without this extended system, especially 
the top ones, but often this helps.   A couple times I had to torch it.   
That is why there are some scorch marks on my 61 from swapping out the 
drivers door.  

Since you already drilled to get the door off, I'd do the  penetrating oil, 
and drill through with a small drill bit, then slightly larger.  eventually 
you can peel the remnants of the bolt out.  if you're careful, you won't 
damage the threads. the threads are the same as the ubiquitous 13mm nuts on 
the bus

 HI Rob,
 Do not use an easy out for stuck bolts!!!!  Especially when you can not get 
 to the other side so you can punch back out the broken easy out!!!
