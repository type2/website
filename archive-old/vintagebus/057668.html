Subject: Re: [VB] Another SoCal Stolen Bus [almost]

I can see it now, an aircooled VW variation on the movie 'Gone in 60
Seconds' called 'Gone in 60 Minutes'.  In the Nicholas Cage role: 
Wilford Brimley.  And somewhere at Terminal Island is a container ship
bound for the Orient, slowly filling with vintage VWs.  B^)

&gt; Ok, something is wrong.  They *can't* be random, isolated, coincidental incidents.
&gt; There's a bigger picture we're not seeing.  This smells like a concerted
&gt; effort with several people involved in the theft and disposal of these
&gt; cars.  With the number and type of cars targeted, we can almost guarantee
&gt; they're after the cars for resale.  You don't joyride double cabs!
