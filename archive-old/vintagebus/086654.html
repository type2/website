Subject: Re: [VB] 64 seat options

Hi Dave,
Check out the type2_dot_com library.  There are two articles there that  have 
some good info for your earlier bus.  As for wether your bus has seat  belt 
mounts would depend on if it had the option added in.  Guessing your's  does not 
since you are asking.
  Best way is to find a 1968-79 bus in a wrecking yard that you can  inspect, 
measure, draw, and possibly even cut out the seat belt  mounts.  Make sure to 
cut a big area out to make sure you  get each complete reinforcement plate.  
Especially for the upper  shoulder belt mounts are good to get from a later 
bus.  Then cut and weld  them into your bus.
  Here is another webpage on the subject:

  As for head rests those should be easily fabricated to work with the  
original seats mounted to the sheet metal just behind them.
