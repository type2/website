Alrighty everyone, I've got the 1776 just about completely assembled.  The
only thing left is to put the swivel foot adjustors on the rocker arms
(found a set I forgot I had - I ordered them last summer, only to find out
they wouldn't work with the ratio rockers.), get the carbs and linkage on,
run the plug wires, and then AFAIK, start it up.  I'll try to get a video or
tape recording of the event which to my knowledge hasn't been posted on a
web page.  I'll probably have to send a copy of the tape to someone to
convert it into real video or mpeg but regardless, I think it'd be neat to
document this so all of you can hear the mumbling, cheering, bsing, etc.
that goes on around here when I'm hard at work with a VW project.

Moving right along, I hit the old Weber book this evening and did some
learning on just what exactly makes these IDF's work.  It's still tough for
me but I have identified various parts of the carbs and found out that
according to the book, the jets are off their mark for a 1776 mill.  I gonna
need to order new jets (which ain't cheap I guess), carb kits, and I'd like
to check out CBP's replaceable venturi which nets about 8 to 12 more HP at
5g's - might be a nice little addition for power if I can afford it.

First of all, here is what the Weber tech book says you must run for an
engine with a 1776cc displacement and dual carb arrangement:

40IDF Jetting Guide Dual Carb

1600cc to 1835cc

Venturi = 28mm (mine is labeled 28)
Main Gas = 140 (mine says 115)
Main Air Correction = 210 (mine says 170)
Emulsion Tube = f11 (mine says f11)
Idle = 55 (mine says 50)

These carbs were rebuilt for a 1600cc engine so it does make sense that some
of the figures read low.  If I had the jet reaming tools and guages, I could
probably open them up myself but alas, I do not. :-(

Will there be any correction needed for my being 1100 feet above sea level?

One more little question I have since I've got your rapt attention.  I have
a set of ratio rockers (1.25 VW) and a set of 34 ICT's.  Can I slap this
stuff on my stock 1600DP in my 74 Super and expect a nice little power
boost?

Later and thanks for reading and for the help.  This stuff is getting fun
again! :-)
