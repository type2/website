Today I got out the vac. and sucked out tons of dirt from the inside of the
bus.  This bus is a bonafide rustybus but man, I'm gonna go ahead and get it
rolling and just work on it as I go.  It seems like such an overwhelming
task but if Thom can take that old roached out 55 Westy and turn it into a
show stopper, well then, I can drive to California in a rusty bus.

Anyhow, while I was on my cleaning frenzy, I pulled out the driver's seat
and there before me was the churchkey.  I don't know if it's correct to have
a church key gas flap for this bus but it has one.  The lock was all seized
up and I just got done fixing it.  For the first time in my life, I opened
the gas flap with the original part.  This is so damn cool.

I'll have some pix later this week.  I've got 3 rolls that need developing..
Later all!
