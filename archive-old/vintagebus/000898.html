Well it had to happen.  My bus project has hit snag after snag and I was hit
with yet another whammy today.  I'm in debt, flat broke, and depressed
almost to the brink of selling the whole project off.

Here's how thing have gone so far:

I got the bus and rebuilt the rear end.  Everything is fine with that
although I ended up having to buy a ton of parts from Ronnie that I didn't
count on.  They drove the VISA purchases higher than I would have liked that
early in the restoration but it was tolerable.  The engine I was told that a
good bottom end wasn't and now I've had to tear that apart and order a bunch
of parts for the rebuild.

Well it turns out that some of the parts I've ordered from Barrett
Enterprises are crap.  The reground lifters that are supposed to be concave
aren't - they are flat.  The local guru looked at them and said he wouldn't
use them.  Okay - I can send them back.
The heads were supposedly rebuilt units.  Little did I know that hiding
under the silver spray paint job was a complete set of used valves all the
way around.  To top it all off, the intake guides are the originals and
looser than what the specs should be.  The exhaust ones have been replaced
but reamed too much so the valves are still sloppy.  I've already had them
semi-hemi cut and bored for 90.5's so I can't return them (another $100).
I'm looking at $50 for a new set of valves, $100 for labor to have the
guides replaced, and the cost of the guides themselves.  All I ended up
buying from Barrett was a set of junk heads which is exactly what I have a
mountain of out in my storage shed.  I spent $150 for a set of junk heads -
can you believe it?

With cores, credits, and the monthly payment, I'll be down to $2000 by the
end of the month but that pretty much does me in.  All the residuals have
taken the bank account down into the emergency money and in order to make
any forward progress, I'm going to have to get out of debt and build up the
reserves again.  Dependant on how the financial stuff goes, I'll either have
to take the bus back out to the farm for storage or sell it to attempt to
get out of debt.  I almost resent this project now because everytime I sit
down and try to save money, it ends up costing me more - but you never know
this for sure until it actually hits you.  I could blow tons of money on
Berg stuff but then I'd be even more in debt and still have a project
sitting outside.

I would like to offer my original bus tranny and reduction boxes for sale
but since I'm posting this to the vintagvw list as well, I'll just have to
have anyone interested in the parts email me at silent_at_beatricene_dot_com

Thanks for reading my speel....
