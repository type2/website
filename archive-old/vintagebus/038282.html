&gt; What i plan to use is a filler called all-metal (on a good 
&gt; bus, bondo is
&gt; fine for a beater) What it is:
&gt; 
&gt; Aluminum dust suspended in polyester resin.  This is good because the
&gt; aluminum dust wont soak up water laike the stuff in bondo will, so you
&gt; wont end up with a bondo plug full of water to rustthe metal 
&gt; under your
&gt; new paint job

I saw some of this stuff pulled off the body of a friend's bus. It does work
as described. After five years under the paint of the nose of the bus the
metal based filler had no rust underneath it at all. The ordinary (prolly
talk filled) filler was discoloured(from retained water?) and was barely
holding on to the rusty metal beneath it.

He had used both types at the same time but had run out of the metal based
stuff and used the ordinary filler to finish the job. Both areas had been
srayed at the same time and neither type had been used to build more than
2mm.

Not an empirical test but good enogh for me to NEVER use cheap filler and
only to use the metal based stuff where there is no other option.

Later
