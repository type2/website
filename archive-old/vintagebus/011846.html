Subject: re; rebuild kits, and roadside help
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

you really have to watch what you get in jcw and other mail order rebuild kits, in my store i sell 4 different brands of bearings, excellent, good,
 bad(customer requested)and worse(for the real cheap person) most mail order sell the lader of the 2 i can beat there prices, make a killing
and have a quilty concious knowing i sold you junk
but hey if it last 5000 miles who cares ( I DO)
SO PAY THE PRICE GET QUALITY PARTS, request them or a good vendor will tell you, there is more profit in the junk parts for the vendor, thats why mail order houses sell them. you can call me and i'll tell you what i feel is good and you can order from me or whoever you want to but at least you'll know what your looking for.

ROADSIDE HELP, on my way back from PALM SPRINGS
today (400 mile round trip) on I10 there was a single cab broken down on the other side of the freeway, without hesitation i made a u'ey across the center divider to help this person out, without reguard to my saftey, could this person be a rapist or murderer, who cares it was an early single cab, it turns out it was a guy and his wife on there way from pheonix to LA on a buying trip for his swapping, thats how he said he makes his living, he also said that this was his everyday driver, just got back from NEW MEXICO, now on to LA, had no bus club knowledge
or affiliation just used his bus to make his living, the best part was the spare parts he carried, dizzy and tools in engine comp. no deck lid, trailer lights for tail lights but it did have nice paint, also had a spare engine in cargo hold, (he said he's blown them up on the road)
changed engines in less then 2 hours on the side of highway before, thats what i call prepared, but like he said he makes his living with this bus
so anyway his problem was the little leg that rubs on the dizzy shaft wore flat, (no lub)will get into that at a later date, changed his points and off he went after thanking me for shinning my headlights in the engine comp. for him. end of storey
