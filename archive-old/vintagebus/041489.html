Considering that the &quot;horsehair&quot; pads are 30+ years old, and that organic
material tends to deteriorate and become brittle, it's no wonder that the
horsehair is shedding!

I replaced mine with a layer of thick felt covered with 1/2 inch extra
firm foam rubber.  the replacement curves under the edges just like the
horsehair did.

If foam rubber had been available at a reasonable price, I think that VW
would have used it in place of the hair.

I seem to recall that there might be moulded foam available for VW seats.
I don't know if it is available for your model and year, but if it is it
would be the way to go!

I am reminded of the abortive attempt to build beetles in the US cited in
the book &quot;small wonder&quot;.  When a US supplier of automotive seats was asked
to bid on the VW contract, they declined.  They said, &quot;You don't have
seats in your cars, you have _furniture_!&quot;
