&lt;&lt; So there is a dillema...cut the roof for a rare original barndoor only 
accesory? or leave it &quot;original&quot;?  I refuse to even drill holes on an uncut 
VW, but since I will be replacing metal anyway, whats the difference? I can 
save the piece and weld it back in later if i so desire... &gt;&gt;

As long as you are putting original accessories on it I don't see what the 
big deal is.  If you were cutting in 70's era custom van bubbled porthole 
windows then we would have a problem.  How many &quot;stock&quot; busses are running 
around out there with safaris that didn't come with them?
