Subject: Re: [T2] adding a light to my engine compartment

I will post you sime pics of the light that my daughter (claralw_at_aol_dot_com) added to my 63 singlecab.
It is an interior light that is wired in to the rear lights. So in the dark when I have the rear lights on I can switch on a light in the engine compartment.
 
It is simple, easy to use and looks original!

&gt;well i hate using a flashlight when doing work in my

&gt;apartment building with not the greatest light. And i 
&gt;was thinking of ading a light into my engine 
&gt;compartment that was bright enough where i didnt need 
&gt;a flashlight has anyone done this before and if so i 
&gt;would love some suggestions thanks to all and have a 
&gt;great newyear &gt; &gt; 
I have yet to actually do this but.... I know that later model GM trucks have a little pull out light that can be used and hangs from the hood. I think a pick-n-pull would have those for cheap. Worth a shot.
