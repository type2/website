Subject: Ronnie's Sheet Metal Effort


Those of you who have ever tried to repair or restore a bus
know what a royal PITA it is to find decent replacement metal.
I know I do.  To help support Ronnie's efforts in getting this
stuff repro'd, I created a petition page similar to the one I
did for the Bentley manual (which comes out 10/1, BTW).  Here's
the link: http://vintagebus_dot_com/metal.html - sound off, even if
you don't need the pieces right now.  This is a way to document
the demand for these parts.  Without any documented demand, nobody
will think it's worthwhile to produce the pieces, and we'll be
stuck having to cut up otherwise good buses.

Thanks!

Thom
