Subject: RE: [VB] Copper or steel brakelines?

Wow - didn't expect as many responses like that - for most things where
there are two answers to a question theres is normally a divide but steel
definately looks the way to go.  In the UK, a company called AH Schofields
do a steel brake line kit for 63 to 67 buses - and he is very highly
regarded as he makes arguably the best repair panels in the UK for buses.
The kit is about 75 dollars plus another 15 dollars for the grommet set, but
it is an 8 piece manufactured kit.  But you can't really but a price on
safety.

A friend had a brake line go on his early Beetle, he crashed into the car
and made a real mess of the front of his very original body - I do not want
this to happen to me so I am going for dual circuit brakes as well as
replacing the lines.

The interesting thing is that there is not too much of a price differential
between copper and steel.

Thanks a lot
Paul
