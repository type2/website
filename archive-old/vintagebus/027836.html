To do this you have to remove one end of the drag link.   Probably the end 
that is straight.  undo the screw holding the two half from turning.  
Position the wheel straight forward.  Position the steeing wheel so it is in 
the middle of the turning and straight across.   Screw in or unscrew the drag 
link so it lines up with the pitman arm.  tighten the bits back down.

Did that last week (2 weeks ago?) on the 61.  And greased everything I could 
find, including through the floor to the forward end of the drag link :)  and 
adjusted link pins, and adjusted st G box, and changed oil in st gear box.  
yum.

good things these trips kick us to make the buses roadworthy.

 Howdy!
 
 I was doing maintenance on my '60 DC yesterday, as the rest of my time is
 gonna be spent on trying to get my '66 Westy ready for BYOB and Kelly
 Park....I was going to try to get my steering wheel aligned properly, but
 couldn't figure out the best way to do it.
 
 I've got the original '60 steering box (which I squirted a bunch of goo
 into), and a '68 front end.  The steering wheel is 90 degrees off when going
 straight (spokes going up/down).  I would love to fix this!
