Hi,

Type3 motors have the distributor driveshaft
set up differently from Type1.  (I  think the
reason was so that the distributor can didn't interfere
with the type3 fan housing when the engine is in tune).

Anyway I digress......just point the rotor at #1 when
at TDC.   A 'late' type3 (assume it is with 1600DP) 
should be timed at 0 deg that is with the 0 deg notch
on the pulley lined up with the little nob on the type3 fan housing
..........  
with no type3 fan housing (converted to upright right?) I
would set the 009 so that the total advance was around 28 deg
(for anyone who thinks this is a little conservative
remember it a bus!...)

&gt; HI
&gt; 
&gt; I am trying to change a type 3 engine into an upright motor for my 61
&gt; bus.  It is a 1600 dp and had fuel injection and all the type 3 stuff.
&gt; (Which has been removed and is for sale, cheap!) I have noticed that the
&gt; distributor drive shaft is turned a little different than on a normal
&gt; type 1 or bus engine.  Do I need to try to remove it and turn it to the
&gt; normal position? Or do I just adjust the notch on the distributor body so
&gt; that the rotor points at it when #1 cylinder is at TDC?  If I leave it
&gt; like it is, do I set my timing differently? Or will it still be 7.5
&gt; degrees btdc? (I am using a 009 distributor.) Thank you for any help you
&gt; can provide.
&gt;
