Hi  Folks,
recently aquired a helphos spot light. Neat little gadget, hangs on  your
split's windshield with a vacuum device.
Unfortunately it came with  no instructions. I'm not sure how to change the
bulb or service the  light.
Don't want to break something while trying to &quot;fix it.&quot;
Wondering  if someone might have instructions or manual for this guy. I could
borrow  or pay owner for a copy?
Perhaps someone knows of a web site?
Thanks in  advance,
Mike Turner

I posted the same question to the vintage bus list a week or so a go,  with 
no luck any how a bit more searching on google and
