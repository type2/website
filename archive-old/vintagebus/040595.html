Yea I've seen it a lot on CNN.  I feel the same way.  Great
commercial.....if it wasn't for the Honda.

Has anyone seen the Ad for a Honda electric car that features a VW
Microbus!?
I saw it only once a few days ago and haven't seen it since then.
The back of the bus is covered with decals that say thigs like...&quot;save the
whales&quot;,  &quot;arms are for hugging&quot; etc and the announcer says that you can
save the world by saying it on the back of your car or by driving ours.
Liked the commercial, liked the bus, didn't neccesarily like the honda!
