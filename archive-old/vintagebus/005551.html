&gt; I wasn't asking about the 8.8.  I was asking about the grades which the
&gt; metric stainless bolts come in, and which of those is comparable to the
8.8
&gt; often used by VW.  At Fastenal, metric 8mm bolts come in '18-8' and '316'.
&gt; Do you know what these numbers mean?  It's hard to tell which number is
&gt; &quot;higher&quot;, since they seem to be from two different rating systems.
&gt;

Unfortunately, for the most part stainless steel fasteners are not available
in high strength grades. 18-8 and 316 refer to the stainless steel
composition and only describe the corrosion resistance. 18-8 is the basic
designation for 300 series stainless, roughly the same as 302. It has good
corrosion resistance under normal conditions. Tensile strength of these
fasteners is about 100,000 psi, slightly less than an SAE grade 5 alloy bolt
(medium strength). 316 stainless has a higher corrosion resistance, it is
intended for applications with exposure to organic acids, specifically
hydrochloric acid. The strength characteristics are the same. It is possible
to find stainless fasteners in the 400 series, which can be hardened for
higher strength, but the corrosion resistance is lower as well as the
availability. The price would  make your jaw drop. In short, use plated SAE
Grade 8 fasteners where strength is an issue, otherwise, 18-8 stainless
steel will serve for other situations. Be sure to use some anti-seize
compound when you put them in to keep them from galling and seizing. Use
copper or brass nuts on the exhaust system. HTH
