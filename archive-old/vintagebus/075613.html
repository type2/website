&gt;
&gt;loads of DNA research was done on yeast, which actually is applicable
&gt;to humanss.  Why yeast?   easy to grow, doesn't take up much space, is
&gt;a eucaryote like us, cheap, and no one is going to protest if you kill
&gt;and dissect it.

_And_ you can do advanced experiments of the environmental factors that
influence its development, such as forcing it to grow in the presence
of hops, barley, and water.  *burp*  &quot;Clearly, further study is needed.&quot;

ObBus: Hopefully this weekend I will do some research around the
campfire with other local VW owners.  There is usually a good showing
of Buses: split, bay, and those funny square ones.
