&lt;&lt; I can hear a rotational whirring sound when clutch is depressed.  My first
thought was T/O brg, but I replaced clutch, T/O, pilot brg about 4,000miles

Hi Don,
Did you make sure to measure the throw out bearing and make sure that it is
evenly placed side to side in relation to the tranny input shaft?  If not and
it is off center the TO bearing will get wiggled side to side from being out
of center to the clutch pressure plate and wear out the TO cross shaft arms
in less than 10,000 miles.

 &lt;&lt;What type of trans is this?  The bus has redux boxes.  I glanced under a
69 bug and noticed the same trans, but it was an IRS.  I am just a little
curious. &gt;&gt;
Hmm, the only way to really know the tranny case is to get both the part
number off of it and the stamped case ID #.  Which if memory serves right
should be both found on the right side of the tranny case.   Eric&amp;Barb
