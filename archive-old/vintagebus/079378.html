Hi Mjhenks,
Our cables measure 1-1/2&quot; x about .150&quot; diameter.
When we converted our 1960 walk thru panel camper conversion to 1964-67 
suspension, we had to have the E-brake cables cut shorter and new ends swedged onto 
the now shorter cables.  These new swedged ends are longer and caused the 
cables to not pass through the rear curves of the cable tubes.  To get by this 
problem we slightly bent the swedged ends so they would pass through the curves. 
 This worked for us!
