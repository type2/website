Opions being what they are-

I have dealt with RMMW based primarily on convenience/laziness. On the good side they are big outfit and generally have stock and ship it quickly.

On the down side they are expen$ive and only want (at least to canada) to ship UP$ which means you incurr major duty changes.

I would prefer to deal with smaller vendors but you might compromise turn around time and stock availability.
