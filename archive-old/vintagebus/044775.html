&gt;  No way. Alot of ppl I know, buy the oldest, dimmest, headlights from those
&gt;  guys that bring the same pile of sh$t to every swap. Then they install them
&gt;  and point them as much towards the ground as they can for the dimmest
&gt;  possible effect.......ie; vintage look.   8)

Hmm, may be true.  But vintage VW owners are not the ones I meet every night 
on the highway, with white-hot piercing headlights that give me phosphenes

microbuses that populate modern highways. (flame suit on)--David
