Subject: Re: [VB] concrete slab

.......................
&gt; That's good advice.  For curing, I recommend plastic sheeting over
&gt; the whole slab and keeping it wet underneath for at least a week.   
&gt; It's a
&gt; pain to keep it under plastic for that long, but in the end you get  
&gt; a much
&gt; stronger slab and reduce the chances of cracking.  As soon as the slab
&gt; gets dry it ends the curing process.

Concrete should develop 75% of its full strength in 7 days, the rest  
in 28 days, but will keep getting harder over time. The best way to  
control cracking is w/ control joints placed in the concrete when wet  
or cut in w/in 72 hours after pouring.  Keep these joints in  
rectangular areas w/ the length never exceeding the width by more  
than 2 or it will crack unevenly in the middle.  All concrete cracks,  
the trick is to control where it cracks.  Shrinkage cracks are what  
occurs as the concrete is curing, stress cracks occur later from  
other issues such as improperly compacted subgrade, moving structure  
that stresses the slab, etc. Shrinkage cracks can be further  
controlled w/ fibers in the conc. but harder to finish, more $$.

  RBC - split window Buses are so light, that their weight will be  
negligible on your concrete slab!
