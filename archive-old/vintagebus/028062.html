Why ?  I have a '62 and was very interested in this thread since safaris are 
on my list.
&gt;&gt;

Its been discussed before, but post-62 busses a have a recessed area where 
the hinges mount.
Thom and I both had problems installing the C.E. safaris because they were 
engineered for busses with this recessed area.
Word of advice for anyone wanting safaris.....
BUY ORIGINALS OR STICK WITH FIXED WINDSHIELDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
