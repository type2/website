 Once I have the front beam back on I am going to remove the gearbox and
 engine, as the engine has a pulled head stud and the gearbox pops out of
 fourth regularly.
 Is it worth pulling out the rod to the rear or is there no need? 
 .........................
If youre removing the tranny, I'd definately remove the rear rod, clean out 
the tubs9 using the rod to push a small rag through works) and replace the 
worn rear shift bushings (2) on the rod in there- they look like little 
badminton birdies.  Grease well, reinstall.  New dust covers at the ends of 
the tube would help keep the grit out of the tube.  You'll be amazed how much 
tighter your shifting will be

think the heat tube only has the grey cover on between the cross beams, not 
in front of it like you said.
