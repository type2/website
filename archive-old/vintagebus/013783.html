He can't get enuf customers?  Mark Adair was reproing it, and can't keep
the dang stuff in stock - it goes as fast as he can make it!

I don't know what Mark was charging for his.  He's gone thru two batches
of the barndoor version, and I still have yet to get a set.

&gt; reproducting outie engine vent trim for 55 thru 3/63 deluxes.  He said: &quot;I 
&gt; would have to make 5000 at first enuf for 275 busses. Retail would have to be 
&gt; about 80-84 dollars a full set. What do you think?&quot;.
