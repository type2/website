Subject: '62 bus color-------I'm S.O.L. I guess

Well, A PO owner somewhere down the line has taken off the ID plate 
behind the front seat and kept it as a trophy. I think the guy that did 
most of the work sofar on the bus was three people back, so I may never 
find the tag. Is there anywhere else I might find the numbers? Also, was 
the VIN number on this tag? The only place I cant look around the 
passenger door. I've yet to be able to get it open. Can the VIN numbers 
be sent to Germany  like the type I's and find out about its birth ?
