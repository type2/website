Subject: Re: Charging aux battery with 30 amp relay

&gt;From: &quot;Snoopy&quot; &lt;vwsnoopy_at_knology_dot_net&gt;

&gt;Someone posted a week or two back about how to wire in a 30 amp relay
&gt;with 10 ga wire so you could charge the aux battery while driving.

http://www.type2_dot_com/~splittyreflect/msg52197.html
http://www.type2_dot_com/~splittyreflect/msg52238.html

Grab a copy of these, as they won't be around forever.  The messages
to the list get added to this &quot;Web reflector&quot; almost as soon as they
are posted, but the reflector only keeps about the last 1000 messages
or so.  After that (and some manual intervention) they go into the
archives at http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/ .

&gt;My 30 amp relay has 5 terminals  labeled 30, 87, 87, 85 and 86.

Read the second link above.  The 10 gauge wire from one battery will
go to 30.  The 10 gauge wire from the other battery will go to one
of the &quot;87&quot; terminals.  Look at the relay carefully; if both &quot;87&quot;
terminals are marked &quot;87&quot; then you can use either one; if one is
marked &quot;87b&quot; then make sure to use the one marked &quot;87&quot;.

Good luck!
