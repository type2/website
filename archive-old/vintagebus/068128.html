Subject: Bad Internic_dot_net, Bad

Hi All,

If anyone tried to email me or visit the web site in the past few days, you
should have received a Dameon Failure notice...  The story is we paid via
phone and with a Visa card to re up our domain name 'dsquared-dev_dot_com' for
nine more years but they failed to register it.  So, on the 5th, they shut
the domain down.  The weird part was I was continuing to update my web site
for it's new 2003 version and everything seemed fine.  The tip off was about
noon on Thursday when I realized that I had received no email from [VB], I
knew something was wrong.  Fast forward to Friday evening and one lady at
Internic_dot_net had my account and verification number regarding the
transaction on the 22nd of January and then one hour later, the next lady
had no information... argh.  Anyway things are back up.

So, if you had those gas tank divider felts in hand and tried to get ahold
of me to get my sending addy, email me again :-)

Glad to be back.

David
