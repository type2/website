Rick,
       Hold on guys.. I have put Polished 5's on a many buses, with early 
brake drums.. Don't use adapters!!  All you gotta do it have the snout of 
your early front drum turned down..  Any one with a brake drum turning 
machine can do it, most won't, you gotta find the right guy or gal.  They 
just have to put the drum on the machine backwards, and turn the cutter 
over.. Not a problem..  Be sure to give them a wheel so they can try it ever 
so aften and don't hog tooo much off.. Tell them to take just enough off, 
There is plenty of meat there, I have done it many times.

As far as the lugs, just buy the late bug kits, they are 14mm, buy 5 kits, 
instead of 4!!  Easy deal..
