&gt;  I've finally ripped into that &quot;new&quot; c/w, balanced 1600 sp that I got in the
&gt;  '67 Kombi a year and some time ago.....my first reason for tearing it down
&gt;  was that it leaked oil steadily while not being run.  The other reason was
&gt;  that the distributor was backwards.  And the under-the-cylinders air
&gt;  deflectors weren't there...basically, my suspicions that I had good reason
&gt;  to check everything out meself were proved well-founded, as I was scraping
&gt;  the orange silicone gunk out of places it shouldn't be...(in the pressure
&gt;  relief plugs?!)...the guy had siliconed the oil plate to the case with no
&gt;  gaskets (neither the cardboard or the copper), and no strainer!  One of the
&gt;  rod nuts was loose (I noticed it turning when I brushed it with a finger),
&gt;  and to top it all off, the inside of the case was gratingly filthy, and the
&gt;  crankshaft was scored and the bearings were all scored and worn!  This from
&gt;  a motor that had supposedly 10-20 miles on it!
&gt;  
good god!   scary what somepeople call rebuildt, isnt it?
