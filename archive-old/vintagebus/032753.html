&lt;&lt;What other years use the same pan, so that it would be a bolt-in

Hi Chris,
1955-65 and then 66-67 had the rearside bulge or cut out for the longer dual 
MC.  We can find stock ones out here for about $30.00 so you would have to do 
better than that for cost.  How many would he hve to make to equal or beat 
that?  How thick would they be so one could figure out how long of bolts one 
would have to use?  Eric&amp;Barb
