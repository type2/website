To paraphrase Homer Simpson, &quot;You can have one of my livers, I don't need
both of them&quot;

Ahh, other lists aren't as well behaved or warm as this one?  Must be the
type of vehicle we're attracted to also means we're patient, frugal,
thoughtful, slow, dim (6 volt owners only), old, rusty, in the way, etc.
Fine with me.
In reality, this is a great list due to the hard, non-stop work of the
moderators and the little figures with the halos sitting on our shoulders
whispering in our ear (stop that, it tickles).

Also... our weekly poker group of about 12 people uses the Egroups list
server (www.egroups_dot_com) to distribute dumb jokes, jabs and japes and at
least weekly, information on the week's poker game location. I can recommend
it for any group that needs to communicate in a list or digest manner.

A local shop-n-rob had some high-top bus toys, 4 7/8&quot; long. I bought the one
with 'Mos Beer, Beer from Germany' decals. It has a white plastic upper body
and a diecast blue metal-flake lower. The plastic upper extends down the
front V. Chrome front emblem (Click &amp; Clack sez the Type 2 logo is the
largest manufacturer's logo ever to be put on production vehicles), chrome
european bumpers, license of 3 VWS 7 on the front, same on the back with a
small VW emblem above the letters/numbers. Has a sliding door with a seam
indent down the middle. Spare tire indent on the divider and an above the
seat divider. It has only a middle seat in the back, ivory colored. Front
dash is too low, but detailed with a grab handle and radio.
Small round tail lights, no front turn signals or semiphores, but push
button front door latches. Bottom says SS5403, Made in China, Mfg with
permisson of VW AG. Pull it back spring action. I paid about $4, cool toy.
