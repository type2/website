Subject: Re: Keeps eating wheel bearings?

So I assembled everything with my gf doublechecking everything I did, and we
took a 150km drive.
After the drive I jacked up the car pushed and pulled on the wheel, and although
I thought at first I could feel some play, after a couple tugs I couldn't.

I still get some thumping, but perhaps it isn't that particular wheel. 

At any rate, the 36hr drive to the FL Keys is on for Sat, and I'll have 15 sets
of bearings with me.

Wish me luck:-)
