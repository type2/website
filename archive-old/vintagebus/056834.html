&lt;&lt; I inherited halogen lights from the PO amongst many other parts that need 
to
 be hung on my DC.  How do I wire them?  They have a two prong connector vs a
 three prong.  I'm guess one's high beams and ones low beams, where's the
 ground?
  &gt;&gt;
I have halogen headlights, and they have the regular 3 prong connectors.   
Fit just like regular headlight.   I'd stick with the three prong, and if you 
want halogens just go to your FLAPS and buy some.  they are nicer when 
driving country roads.
