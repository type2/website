Subject: ideas as list currency

I ,as a long time listee have become more and more disheartened by
recent events. I have owned VW's for many years, and  have acquired over
the years sufficient experience, literature and local networks to sort
out most things. Why do I remain? Well I like the variety of ideas, many
of which challenge my own so that I think through it all again. I enjoy
the community of like minded folk, the home spun philosophy some wrap
around  their bus experiences and the vicarious exposure to fanaticism
that every now and then sneaks out. When all is said and done however,
all we are doing is trying to keep very old cars on the road. This is
constant work and I dont believe there are many short-cuts. Simple
questions deserve simple answers but it is also true that  each answer
is like an iceberg-the real story is yet to be told. Enough! This is
about ten lines more than I normally write.
