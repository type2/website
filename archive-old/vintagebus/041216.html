Subject: Re: [VB] My new find- not signed!



&gt; So Woody, are they &lt;the Garcia buses&gt; really signed by
&gt; Jerry?

I'm not 100% sure.There is a Jerry signature on both buses.If it's actually
his hand that did it, I doubt it.An authorized reproduction is my guess.
Jim, if you look at the photo I sent you ,you will see it over the rear
wheel well.
Have a good day all,

                                        woody
