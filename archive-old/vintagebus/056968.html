Subject: Re: [VB] Daily Driver Poll/Bus Sighting :p

I drive 30+ miles Mon-Thu in my Westfalia and more
than that on weekends. I actually CAMP in my Camper. I
rarely see another bus, but on occassion I do. She is
slow but so what;It's not how you get there, not when.
If it's too cold get a gas heater!

&gt; all this &quot;bus sighting&quot;  &quot;stuff&quot; (to put it 
&gt; politely) leads me to ask the following
&gt; question/take the following 
&gt; poll:
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; how many of you actually DRIVE your bus 
&gt; DAILY?!?!?!? (i will also accept any air-cooled vw
&gt; in place of &quot;bus&quot;). NOT a 
&gt; honda, ford, chevy, whatever, but a BUS (or air
&gt; cooled vw)? 
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; no lame &quot;boo-hoo, i have to drive on the freeway&quot; 
&gt; excuse. i do too--every day. i go 60-65 and people
&gt; pass me.
&gt; 
&gt; no &quot;boo-hoo, it's too cold&quot; wuss-out. i drove my 
&gt; busses every day in cold pennsylvania winters for
&gt; years--it's called making the 
&gt; heat work well and learning to drive with gloves and
&gt; a hat. i also learned to go 
&gt; to the car wash somewhat regularly to wash the salt
&gt; off, and my busses didn't 
&gt; rust out.
&gt; 
&gt; no &quot;boo-hoo, but i have to drive &quot;X&quot; amount of 
&gt; miles every day&quot; whining. i drive my bus about 50
&gt; miles a day.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; i don't even own any other kind of car, so what 
&gt; else WOULD i drive?!
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; i'm just curious.
&gt;
