&lt;&lt; Not sure the number, but is a dual vacuum dual advance unit out of a '71.

Hi Steve,
the distributor number should be on the side of the distributor.

&lt;&lt;  What is blueprinting the lower pulley? &gt;&gt;

We have a used swap meet $5.00 power degree pulley we have done this 
blueprinting to for as a tool to get certain degree marks set onto stocker 
pulleys.  You can and should do this blueprinting to the stocker pulley/s you 
have on your engines or do check the degree marked pulley.  Yes, some of the 
degree marked pulleys have thier markings offset!
     Make sure the VW is in nuetral and turn the crankshaft via the lower 
crank pulley bolt (If this is still too stiff to do yourself remove all four 
sparkplugs and if that still does not ease things up enough remove the fan 
belt.) of the engine to where the distributor and whatever markings in the 
lower pulley to TDC # 1 cylinder.  Remove #1 sparkplug, and insert a long 
thin screwdriver and keep the handle downward as possible without binding on 
the diagonal sides of the sparkplug hole so as to keep the tip of the 
screwdriver as perpendicular as possible to the outside of the piston to 
prevent the screwdriver from being bound by the piston when it moves toward 
the head.  Turn the crankshaft back and forth by the lower pulley bolt and 
feel the screwdriver for out/inward movement.  You want to find the #1 TDC 
spot by the screwdriver being pushed outward as far as possible.  This TDC 
spot will feel about 4 degrees wide and so 0 TDC will be center in this area. 
 To find and mark your 180 degree for adjusting your 2-4 cylinder valves by 
feeling # 2 cylinder for it's TDC just as you did for #1 cylinder.
  Since we have the VW made lower pulley puller we remove the stock lower 
pulley and set for #1 TDC with our $5.00 degree pulley we have already 
blueprinted for the 0 and 180 degree marks.  We also hand sand the inner 
diameter of the stocker pulleys til they just slide on the crank by hand 
pressure.  then via thew degree pulley we ste for 0, 7, 10 and 180 degrees 
and at each of these slide back on the stocker pulleys to verify the timing 
marks already on them or file in new ones.
  This way we all too often find volks are timing and adjusting thier VWs 
valves off of where they should be.  This can be damaging to the engines or 
at least rob you of HP one could have for the $ you are pouring into the gas 
tank.  IE Clara came over to have this done to her driver bus and turned out 
the 0 degree mark she thought she was using was 5 degrees BTDC.  So instead 
of 7 BTDC timing for the 009 distributor, it was only 2 degrees BDC!
