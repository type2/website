If you're taking a lot of paint down to bare metal, my opinion would be to 
use paint stripper.  The stuff works fast if you do it right.  Two coats is 
about all it took for me, and I had at least five layers of paint.  The 
brand I used was Aircraft, and it smells horrible.

Some tips for ya...be sure to scuff/abrate the surface before you slop it 
on.  This helps the stripper bite more effectively.  Also, do not let this 
get in any cracks or grooves where you can't remove it.  If paint is sprayed 
on a surface where a residue of this is left, it will soften the paint and 
not allow it to harden properly.  I poured the glop in an old tupperware 
container and used a paint brush to apply it.  The stuff seems to eat 
through weak plastics, so find a sturdy container.

Just my two cents.  I've tried areas with the DA as well as the stripper, 
and I favor the stripper.  Good luck with whatever way you go.

&gt;[...]
&gt;I am going for large scale removal of current paint down to the metal so I
&gt;will work with the 80 or 100.  And yes I guess I meant DA... don't know
&gt;where the C came from unless I was thinking DAC tapes?
