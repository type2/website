Tonight I remembered a hint from the
  type 2 list about using paraffin and worked so easy it was amazing. Heated
  those suckers up and applied wax till it stopped melting. ALL frozen nuts
  came off with no effort at all. Amazing!

Old millwright's trick.  May I suggest using real bee's wax.  It works much
better.
