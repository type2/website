Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Porsche pulley

OK,

You got me going. I have had a 356 pulley from mid america motor works for
several weeks. I went out and got a 890mm belt. I have the 6-3/4&quot; diameter
Scat degree'd pulley. I ended up using all but one of my shims inside the
pulley. I also tried an 885 belt, but that was too short. Also the part
number on the belt was prefaced with an 11. Maybe the new belt is a little
wider than the old, I have not compared.

The 356 pulley is nominally 1/2 inch smaller in diameter than the  stock
one. So pi times .5. divided by about 2 gives around 3/4&quot; shorter belt. By
those numbers the 885 should have fit.

My only worry now is that the belt will slip on the new pulley. It does not
seem to grab as well as the old belt and pulley. I judged this by when I
tightened the nut. It was easier to slip the pulley than it was before. I
think I got the belt about as tight as I dare. The new belt does not have
the cloth covered facing that the old one has.

Chris
