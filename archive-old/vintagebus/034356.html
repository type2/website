Hmmm,

Never thought about this one before.  Sorta like
your mm vs inches thing.

The paper size is a European standard and it
is known as A4, or more fully A4-ISO (210 x 297 mm).
As opposed to the US letter or US legal
that you guys would normally see.

Gotta be a stationary store with A4 binders
there somewhere?

&gt; I would like to find a source for a European 4 ring binder so I can put my
&gt; 
&gt; loose tech bulletins and other vintage info in to protect it.  I have not 
&gt; been able to find any locally.  It seems that the paper size is 11 3/4
&gt; inches 
&gt; by 8 1/4 inches.
&gt; I have several shop manuals and a special tools for local manufacturer
&gt; book 
&gt; from the 50's that use the same paper size.  My question is this euro
&gt; only? 
&gt; Or did VW use it exclusively during the 50's.  
&gt; 
&gt; Any help would be appreciated.
