having just come back from a vacation to New Mexico and spending a

&gt; lot of time in the mountains, i have come to a different conclusion on
&gt; trannies than i once had (though my engine being tired &amp; now dead may skew
&gt; my ideas...)

Not to complicate the problem further, but Gene Berg had a real good answer to the

freeway flier trans. . . . .his 5 speed.

His idea of using stock 1st and 2nd, then using close 3rd and 4th, and finally a
stock (or taller) 4th for the 5th gear sounds like it fixes all the mentioned
problems.

I ran a stock 1600SP with a 3.88 and a bug 4th (.89).  It ran almost 80 without
too much trouble and a good 60 going up the grapevine.  I was happy with that.

Another consideration:  I saw a sheet from a well-known trans rebuilder that
showed anything geared higher than a 4.12 with an .89 needs extensive oil cooling
capabilities.  This makes sense considering that the fan no longer turns as fast.

No affiliation, yada yada yada.
