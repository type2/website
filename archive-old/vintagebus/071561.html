&gt; 78 stroke, 90.5 bore. With 57cc's in the head, and a 10cc dish in the
&gt; piston, you can go with .065&quot; deck, which is plenty of squish for a street
&gt; motor gives you 7.5:1 CR.
&gt;
&gt; I don't see a need to go over 5Krpm in a bus myself. Plenty of low end
&gt; torque is what will make a bus a happy driver around town, and if he's
&gt; running a .82 4th, with a 3.88 r&amp;p, I don't see him needing to go over 5k
&gt; myself.

Well, there's always second gear :)
I don't seem to find heads with anything near 57cc's.
Average chambers in my last 150 og heads were 47.
If I'm gonna spend money on a stroker, I will be using
premium gas and look for highway performance.
Somebody's gonna do the math and tell you that 149 mph
is way too fast to be doing 5K rpm anyway :)
