Ill put in my vote for what i'd buy...

A tent that is exactly like the awning tent for earlier splitties, thats
my favorite one....

I'd make the poles out of aluminum for easy stowage/light weight.

Stamp the bumper brackets as original...(or at least the same kind of
mounting)

Make the roof brakets as original (or at least function as original and be
the same general dimesnion....)

Fabric would be canvas, striped, wether or not those stripes matched
original doesnt matter, just that its striped and canvas (big fat wide
stripes like original would be way hip!). I would buy a cheaper tent with
canvas that was not that close to OG over a tent that cost twice as much
just because the material was ohsovintage...

The price at which i would become less interested would be in the $500
range.... much higher than that and i would pass.  the price at which i
would run immediately drooling to the bank would be $2-300 or so. In
between i'd look at the quality and think.  I am a notorious cheapskate
though...

Just MHO,

Steve
