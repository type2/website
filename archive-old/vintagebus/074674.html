Subject: Shift Rod for 63 Bus

I have a highroof panel van that was made in early 63.  The shift rod bad 
and needs replacement.  I've heard there was an early and a late bus shift 
rod.  My question is &quot;when did the change occur&quot;?  I need help finding a 
good replacement.  Actually, all I need is the forward part of the shift 
rod, from the jam nut to the plate that the shifter bolts to under the cab 
area.

Many thanks for any help,

Charles
