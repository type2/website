hi all,
I have noticed a recent trend lately... Everyone is
driving cars other than busses it would seem.
Have we moved into a new era where busses are for
shows and garages and other cars are for driving?
Some of the greats in bus-lore have jumped ship...
Trailering Barndoors that run fine to VW shows...

--------------------------------
Thanks for the compliment and the flamebait! =)
Jumped ship? Pfft! not even close. We're down for
life.
I never said, nor infered that I was anywhere close to
a &quot;great&quot;. Just have been working on and driving
aircooled pre-68 typeIIs + an aircooled Vanagon Westy
for longer than I can remember~on a daily basis. My
family currently has no other &lt;operating&gt; vehicles
other than buses of this vintage. For the first time
*ever* I am choosing to trailer my bus and give myself
a break. I have been stating for months that my '54 is
in great shape and that I need to &lt;not want to&gt; sell
the vehicle for operation of personal family business
reasons. In fact, I mentioned to the wife last night
that it's a b*tch that I have to sell the nicest bus
that I have. I choose not to risk compromising it's
current condition prior to *the* events at which my
largest target market will be in attendance. It is
necessary to guard it's current condition and
potential value. 
Guaranteed that I will return to Phoenix, continue
driving my '63 on a daily basis (50++ miles per day),
my wife continues in driving her bus on a daily basis.
How many folks do you know who completely restores a
splitty and drives it on a daily basis for four
seasons now including driving it to Kelly Park,
Seattle Vintage show, several Classics, SOTO meets and
the Familientfest, camp in it each time *and* kick ass
at the awards table. We drove the barn last year. It
performed well and recieved a polite award from the
fine OCTO folks. This year my health is down a little,
time is tight and it's business-not pleasure.
If you really want to carry on the tradition you will
bring dead presidents and &quot;put up.&quot; An open title will
be on hand...
I know (maybe more than others) that it is easy to sit
behind a keyboard and snipe at faceless folks outthere
in cyber-vanland. Occassionally, a little restraint is
in order.
I look forward to meeting you and sharing the beer
that you owe me. Thanks for the humor and the
flamebait.
No jumping ship, just trying to prevent a sinking one.
