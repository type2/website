&gt; I sell 6 different brands and 2 styles of mirrors, the round ones I sell are
&gt; 1. Hellas NOS/OEM commercial mirrors, these have plastic backs (gray) and a
&gt; universal clamp that will work on about any round arm. 2. Flat Four
&gt; stainless round mirrors with stainless clamp. 3. Round aluminum style with
&gt; VW logo and part number on the back (these are made in Taiwan and I think
&gt; are of pretty good quality compared to the price you have to pay for Flat
&gt; Fours stainless that have a funky distorted mirror in them. Then on to the
&gt; elephant ear style of mirror, 1. WCM these seem to be the best but they have
&gt; black arms, I was told by WCM that these are made for/by them.

WCM had a pretty funny reason for the black arms.  Loren actually took the VWoA
mirrors off his single cab and had them copied.  They made them 'exactly' as the
sample provided.  Loren saw the first article and ok'd them.  He hadn't even
realized that years before he had painted the arms black due the rust that kept
forming on the originals.
