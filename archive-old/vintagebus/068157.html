Subject: Re: [VB] Friday...Collecting...

I am overcome by their collection of STUFF...
------------------ Clip ------------------------
They are not collectors. They just never haul their junk off or throw it
away.
I have a selection of whitworth bolts from my British bikes and cars I
had back in the 50s.
I match that up with the standard thread and now metric thread fasteners.
That is the smallest of my collections.
I also have five spare engines (three built and ready to go), two
transmissions and various other spare parts that are &quot;one mans trash and
another man's treasure&quot;.
Pitch that in with four working computers and a couple of file cabinets
full of old modems, mother boards, 20 meg hard drives and I fell like a
true collector.
As long as you have an understanding wife you'll be OK but if you ever
let those special treasures go, she'll never let you have them again.
She'll put a tanning bed in your extra computer table spot, a sewing
machine or other woman thing where you had your spare engines. 
My friend built a $5,000.00 24x30 storage building at his farm, nice
building with insulation, good sturdy flooring, plenty of windows and his
wife filled it with arts and crafts stuff and his welding, cutting, drill
presses, compressors, lathes, band saws are all sitting outside rotting
in the weather.
Never give you your stuff guys .................. its a once in a
lifetime collection that you'll never be able to build or duplicate
again.
