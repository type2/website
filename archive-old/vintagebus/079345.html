&gt;&gt;  For electrics, make sure that you have the hard-start  relay installed on 
your starter.  &lt;&lt;


Hi Volks,
We view those hard-start relays as a bandaid!  Even if it does solve  the 
starting problem for now it still leaves the rest of the electrical system  with 
a resistance somewhere which causes voltage drop.  Which in turn will  affect 
headlights, running lights, signals, wipers, to be dimmer/slower.   Which in 
turn means not being seen or seeing as well in not only rainy  and/or dark 
situations, but even in nice daylight weather.
  Better to get a voltage/ohm meter from your local hardware store for  about 
$15.00 and compare the voltage at the battery posts to all points of  the 
electrical system to locate where any voltage drop happens.  Also make  sure both 
the battery and tranny grounding cables are clean at both  ends and bolted 
tightly.  Get rid of any battery cables with those bolt on  the ends of the 
cables repair battery clamps.  It is a must to solder  all the brass clips of the 
post-1960 fuse box together (pre-1961 fuse  box rivets must be soldered) and 
see the headlight switch repair  article Matt Roberds and we wrote up in the 
type2 library.  We even  solder the OG coil riveted connected terminals on the 
coils to prevent  problems.
  Yes, alot of work, but one ends up with a more reliable VW and not  with 
another relay to fail later.
