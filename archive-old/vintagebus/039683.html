Dear List

I have installed a 68 balljoint front-end to my 67 single-cab , altough the 
ride is very good it is really higher than stock and doesnt look nice . I 
dont want to lower the front , I have welded adjusters to my bug and it was 
painfull , dont want to make it to my bus , is there a easierway to do it 
than welding adjusters for bus-balljoint ?
Another idea is to install taller tires at rear but how tall can they be ?? 
now the bus has 7.5 14 at front and rear .  May I fit 205 80 14 at rear or 
what is the maximum for rear ?? and I dont want to go any smaller than 185 
65 14 at front ..

Thanks

Eren Berberoglu
67 single (kasket)
