Subject: Docproject back online, sorta

It's been a while since I was subbed to the list, so I wasn't sure if this
was appropriate &quot;every day&quot; material...so I waited for Friday.  And, hi
again :-)

The site at:

http://wow.atlasta_dot_net/~mriluvu/oacdp/

aka, &quot;Obsolete Air-Cooled Documentation Project&quot;, has been down for a
while.  I tried to find a free provider that offered the 600+ MB of space
needed to host the site in its current form and failed to do so -- but I
put it back online, albeit in a manner that isn't 100% straightforward.

http://failsure_dot_net/media/oacdp/
The above location is not available M-F 0700-1800 Eastern time since it
sits on a T1 shared by a corporate network.

http://bfe.homelinux_dot_net/oacdp/
The above location is not available at all times the the previous server
IS available, since it's my home internet connection...it'll be slow so
consider waiting for failsure_dot_net to open up.

Summary: business hours on the east coast of the US, failsure_dot_net is
unavailable.

Hopefully atlasta_dot_net hosting will be available again soon, but this will
work in the meantime.  I had copies of all the files but the webpages
themselves are a bit outdated...I'll be cleaning those up later.

I'm announcing this here only. Feel free to tell others you think might be
interested though.

Andrew W.
