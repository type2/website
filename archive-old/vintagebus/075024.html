Subject: NEW Dropped spindles

  Coming soon to a bus near you, BRAND NEW dropped spindles. These are
custom made from all NEW parts. These will be available with your CHOICE of
drop from 2 inchs to 4 1/2 inchs (no need for a lowered beam anymore). The
only down side so far is that they will only accept DISC BRAKES (we are
working on retaining stock drum brakes though). The projected retail price
on these will be between $1000 and 1200 dollars INCUDING new wide 5 disc
brakes!!!

enough interest

prototypes for viewing at the CLASSIC weekend
