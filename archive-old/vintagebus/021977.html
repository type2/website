&gt; Subject: 1962 van
&gt; 
&gt; my nephew is looking at a 1962 VW &quot;double cab&quot; bus pickup.  Thats what
&gt; he has told me over the phone.  It it minus a tranny and needs a rebuild
&gt; but only has a little rust.  He can get it for about $100.  What body
&gt; styles did the bus have that year and what is the value once
&gt; rebuilt/restored of such a bus?
&gt; 
&gt; He is looking at a tranny in a 1960 van which is sitting in a swampy
&gt; area (not real bad either).  Could a tranny be partly in water and froze
&gt; 1/2 the year and still be OK after 10-20 years?

sounds like a heckuva deal for a 62 double cab body.      

the basic body styles were available in 62

commercials- 
panel van
kombi
truck (single and double cabs)
ambulance
american made campers (buildt from kombis or panels)

passenger -
standard microbus
deluxe microbus (with and without sunroof)
Westy camper

high roof panel vans were not available till the 63 model came out

the model are the kombi and standard micro, westy, deluxe non sunroof,
american campers, panels, deluxe w/sunroof, trucks, ambulances- sort of in
that order of usualness.  Double cab trucks are fairly unusual and wanted,
worth more than most models.  There were few commercials imported in the mid
60s, as the tariff was raised, making a VW truck cost the same as an American
truck, when previously it cost a bit less.   So, a 60ish truck is much more
usual here than a 67 truck.   I think there are a lot more commercial VW
type2s in Europe.

However, I doubt a tranny that has sat IN WATER for years would be any good.
It would rust up the gears- garbage time.  If the water was high enough to get
to the tranny level.     Might  (maybe, if not rusted solid) be useful for
bolting into the truck to tow it home, but that's about it.

if the water didn't get high, if may be a good driver.  but then again, it may
not.
