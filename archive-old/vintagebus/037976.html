 2 shift couplers
 
 9-55 dated slotted &quot;smooth&quot; (non crows foot) rims

you need one rear shift couple (sandwich style for your year, orit's noisy) 
and one front one?  or what?  WW sells repro front ones, which work, but the 
ID is WRONG WRONG WRONG which bugged me when I put it on my 61.  It'll go 
wonky, gotta get me a good OG one.


Thats what I was hoping for.
I am running a later one in back for my 57's split case tranny and its kinda 
noisy.
Needto find a sandwich one for the westy.
I'll be up for puyallup, maybe hit avereys on the way through town.

BTW, for an anal resto, i'd get earlier rims for an oct 55 bus.  FWIW the 
rims on my 53 are dated sometime in 52, about a year before it was made.  
Dunno when they started making 15&quot; bus rims, but I'd say if you can find some 
first run ones that's the e  ticket ride.

I think I saw a 2-55 bus rim once.
I have one original rim for the westy. Right down to the original crappy tan 
paint they applied (by hand I think).
Its dated 9-55.
I woulda guessed earlier....but this wheel definately came with the bus.

talking about AR, I am happy to have lug bolts with the early (pre 54) part 
number on my 53, not that anyone will see when the hub caps are on.  AR AR 
AR, I know, not that the paint is shiny.  I like buses that look ratty but 
have original correct parts.&gt;&gt;

I made sure my 57 had all matching lugs with 211 part numbers on the back.
Havent gotten that far for the camper but I'm sure I'll do it too.
I'm thinking of paining the drums tan since I would guess westfalia shot the 
paint while the rims were on the bus!!!!
