What I did for mine was pretty easy, I bought 6 cans of rubberized
undercoat, the stuff that comes in a spray can. It's used for
fenderwells, that kind of thing.
I used to run high power stereo systems and I had a problem with
vibration and road noise interferring with the quest for perfecct sound.
So I applied the undercoat and problem solved.
To get back to my bus, I had zero panels or interior in my bus, and the
road noise
was deafening. I applied the undercoat to the interior metal of the bus,
made myself a vapor barrier(s) with 9 millimeter plastic, and made new
panels., The difference was astounding. I could hear. I spent $30 for
the undercoat and the plastic. I've zero rust
problems , and the undercoat,   coats everything.  I liked it so much I
did the cargo floor
and the rear area above the engine. You could fill my bus up with water
and swim in it.
I put the mats back in and you cant tell . My bus is really quiet and
everyone who rides
in it , tells me. It also seems that the undercoat has helped out in the
thermal loss department also.
