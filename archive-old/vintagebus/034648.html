Hi Mike,
Sounds like you have the usual mid life spare tire sag most guys get!  ;-)

&lt;&gt;

Sounds like you need part number 211 411 033 torsion springs that has nine 
leaves each used from chassi number 20 - 117 902 starting in 55 and used up 
through at least the early 70s.  We do not have our post-1967 bus parts 
manual here so mayhaps someone else who does can provide the chassi or date 
numbers these parts were used.   Eric&amp;Barb
