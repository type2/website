&lt;&lt; Better just stay home if you are that afraid of driving a bus.  The most
 important thing you need along is creative problem solving, and the most
 obvious spare parts.  If things like front wheel bearings and clutch
 components are causing you even a wee bit of concern, don't leave until
 you fix them...  a little forsight can prevent paranoia.

Hi, 
Well we are not afraid to drive our buses, but things do happen sometimes.  It
would be nice to compleatly rebuild the mechanicals every 50,000 miles or so.
Instead we do the best to keep things in good shape, but something wears out
sooner than expected occassionally and one can not rely on VW repair shops to
have either the parts or trained mechanics.  Let alone trying to count on
breaking down within walking distance of a parts shop, and if it is late in
the day and/or a holiday even worse.  Like we said this list is formulated
from experience not paranoia and often we have been able to help others who
have broken down without bringing there own parts themselfs.  Most of the
stuff is small and in the end fill about two small milk crates of area and the
oil sits in the nonbattery tray in the left rear corner of the bus.  Whenever
you are up in the NW USA we would be happy to show you how it all dissappears
(Except the hydralic jack.) out of sight in our 1960 panel camper.  Try
looking up Montana, Nevada, Idaho, N. Dakota, Utah,  for list members sometime
and then look at a map of those states.  In otherwords if you are afraid of
carrying spare parts then do not travel over this type of very empty space.
