Subject: gas guage in a '60 bus probs

hey volks,

some time ago i posted an inquiry about putting a gas guage in my '60 westy.
after all the responses, i figgered the best thing to do would be to install
a beetle speedo (i used a '67) with a guage built in and put in a new tank
with a sender. my tank was in bad shape anyway. so, i've got everything
installed but cannot get the gas guage to read properly. the level on the
guage flucuates wildly and reads about 1/2 tank low when it is stabile. i've
tried a bunch of other guages (beetles, ghia, and bus) and the only guage
that seems to work is from a late model (late '70's) bus. i can't really fit
that guage into my '60 without dash mods and that's not an option for me...
anyway, i'm wondering if this is due to resistance? obviously, the sender
wire is a lot longer in a bus than either a beetle or ghia. which i think
means more resistance. since the bus guage is the only one that worked, is
it made to handle this resistance? any ideas? btw, i haven't checked the
sensor (it was new) as i'd have to remove the engine again and i was hoping
for an easier solution :-)

thanks for any help or ideas,

tony
