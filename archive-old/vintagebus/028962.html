Subject: Just A Few Tips

I recently had a friend scan in a bunch of my &quot;just a few tips&quot; manual
that came with my 62 bus.  I thought some of you may have an interest in
this...so I made up a site.  Anyone ever seen these before???  I know
people have seen the ones for beetles.  This booklet folds out to be
about 2' long.
