Subject: Re: horn repair

&gt;I checked the archives with some help there from Matt and Eric &amp; Barb.
&gt;I guess the condenser gains then loses a charge, causing the contacts
&gt;to open and close.

Actually, the magnetic field produced by the coil makes the contacts
open.  Then the magnetic field collapses and the contacts spring back
closed.  This allows current to flow again, building up the magnetic
field... lather, rinse, repeat.  The condenser is there to reduce
arcing at the points - the horn would probably still work for a while
without it.

&gt;but in its rest state-the contacts should be closed, right?

Yes.

&gt;since i mangled the gasket-could i just use some liquid gasket stuff,
&gt;like permatex?

Probably.  You might also be able to cut a new gasket out of thick
paper, like a grocery sack.

&gt;does it makes sense to just put it together, and adjust the screw with
&gt;it on the bus?

If you don't have an easy way to jump it to the Bus battery, then yes.
I don't think the AAs can supply enough current to do the job.  If you
have a couple of pieces of wire and a pair of pliers then you may be
able to adjust it without the full install.  The pliers are to hold
the horn bracket at the end where it bolts to the Bus - it appears to
be important that the rest of the horn is free to vibrate (pictures
in Bentley).  Jump the horn to the Bus battery and try adjusting it.
If you can get a nice tone that way, then install it correctly.  Don't
forget to paint over or Permatex the adjusting screw when you're done.

Good luck!
