Subject: Re: [VB] Dead engine in Miami-WTB used cam or maybe even
  complete used   engine

...

&gt;
&gt;real problem is that I can't just walk into a VW shop &amp; buy a new cam &amp; drop
&gt;it in.  Why not?  Because my engine was built using one of those *%#^!!!
&gt;aluminum Type 1 cases that gave everybody who bought one a permanent migraine.



LOL!!
great minds think alike - i was about to email the lists looking for 
a used camshaft and lifters, as MY aluminum case is at competition 
engineering getting an exorcist to look at it. and my spare motor has 
dished lifters, so i need to replace them and the bumpstick on the 
cheap. so if anyone out there has a complete package... stick, gear 
and lifters...  let us know - we'll share!  :)
