I would love to find original replacements, but what I have used in the past with good luck is a couple of layers of plastic from the page divider tabs from a notebook.  You know, Wal Mart, 88 cents.  Piece of card stock with a little plastic tab you slide your divider label into? It separates your math homework from your English homework.  Those and a little super glue worked well for me.  Let me know if you have any better ideas out there as I am about ready to redo the speedo in my daily driver bus.
