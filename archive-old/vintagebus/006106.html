&gt; *properly* get a VW up to the same level.   As an example, I hear the
GoFast
&gt; guys prattle on all day long about how &quot;stroked&quot; they are, and their
webber
&gt; 42 DNF (did not finish) carbs, yet I never hear brakes mentioned.

    it sure appears to me that you are generalizing about things you have no
personal experience with... therefore, it's hard to give some of your
statements any credibility.

    fwiw, i have also built and driven a berg 1776 in my '69 bubbletop bus,
for over 80k miles... stock heads, cam, and carb.

    i did find that there was slightly more maintenance with the 2110's,
because i had to oil the dual carb linkage a lot more often.

&gt; You Berg disciples should be more low key - if more people were to try to
buy
&gt; their stuff, either the prices will go up even more, or quality will go
down
&gt; due to trying to increase production.  They will become a victim of their
own
&gt; sucess.

    LOL!
