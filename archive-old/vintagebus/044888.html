&lt;&lt; Roofing tar has been suggested as an anti corrosion coating on the list. 
If the stuff were applied behind the panels in a thick enough coat would it 
have any sound/vibration dampling qualities?&gt;&gt;
Hi Michael,
We would be carefull of applying it too thickly.  Like paint if applied too 
thick it will chip or peel off too easily later, and when heated during hot 
weather could slough/drip off.  You might want to check out super beetles 
doors.  VW used tar to glue a square, thick tar paper sound deadnener pad to 
the center of the doors.  This should be easy, and worthwhile to adapt to bus 
doors.  As for the rest of the bus you should look into either styrofoam 8x4' 
sheets or we have been hearing of a rubberized flat roofing material that 
might work well.  The former product should work well as not only a sound 
deadener, but as a thermal insulator as well.  The roofing membrane probably 
will only work well as a sound deadener.   Eric&amp;Barb
