Subject: Stolen Vert Resolution
Mime-Version: 1.0


I settled with the insurance company today on the 'vert.  They gave me
$6300 for it.  I didn't have to fight much; I simply took all the receipts
for every little thing I'd bought for it, along with a lot of pix, and some
ads off the 'net for similar year convertibles.  It took them about a month
to do their research.  I probably could have held out for more, but I'm not
in this to make money, and I honestly didn't expect them to offer that much.

Thanks again for all the support and words of comfort!
