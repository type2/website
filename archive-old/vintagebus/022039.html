&lt;&lt; Does anyone have a photo of how an early bus air cleaner works with a gas
 heater? Right now the Zebra bus' air cleaner is hanging off to the right
 with a coat hanger, but that can't be right. Charlie H once mentioned that
 there is a special bracket for that, but I've never seen it. Anyone have a
 good photo or  &gt;&gt;

you dont' need a gas heater for the air cleaner.  Yes the 36hp air cleaners 
don't have the preheat attachment, and so have more carb icing problems.  At 
least you get a manual choke.  If you are worried about the preheat for the 
carb that much you can use a bus 40hp air cleaner, they have the pre heat 
attachement.

The 36hp motors wear the air cleaners on the left.  The tube that goes across 
to the air cleaner has a tab on it that where the air cleaner is on the left 
sits above and to the left of the coil.   Now 

Visualise a triangular braket with threee holes drilled in it. 

the bracket is attached to the fan housing with the nuts that attach the 
coil.  The third hole in the triangle lines up with the hole in the flange on 
the tube.  Use a 14mm bolt what is that m8 , and attach the two.   voila, air 
cleaner is sturdy.


If you cant find one you can make something that does the trick.
