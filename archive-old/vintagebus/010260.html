WOW! GREAT! YEAH BABY! YEEHAW!  AWESOME! COOL!  I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!

Bustoberfest 2000 was a huge hit.  Everyone that came to it had a great time
and we all made new friends or reinforced current friendships.

For a long time now, Rob Laffon and his son Justin, Terry Wolfe (all from
Omaha) have been wanting to do some campouts but the problem was that in
previous years, Terry didn't have a bus and then later had a &quot;most in need
of restoration&quot; project, Rob had a Westy with an inner craving for a split,
and I had a project bus that wasn't roadworthy.

This summer, things came together with Terry Wolfe's bus completed enough to
road trip in, my bus became road worthy, and Rob - not being able to stand
it any longer - bought a sweet 66 single cab.

During our travels this year, Rob got the hankering for a single or double
cab due to the influence of Dan Kinsey in KCMO (now in Florida) because of
crusing in his 58 Binz.  I went to Dan's 3 times this year and the Binz is
really a bus to behold - fun to cruise in with the safaris open.  After all
that cruising, one almost began to wonder if the Red Elvises' music actually
was a factory option.   :-)

During our June trip to the Mo-Kan show, word was mentioned to Pink Newell
and Ric Taylor (from KCMO and Topeka respectively) about having an OVWC/KC
Kombis sponsored event involving a campout.  It made the most sense to
locate a place somehwere in  between the 2 areas.  As it was, the Kansas
contingent had about an hour's more worth of driving compared to the
Nebraska contingent.  Nevertheless, sometime back in September, Pink and Ric
scouted out Indian Cave State Park on their own and came to the conclusion
that this was a great spot to hold the event at.   A joint scouting effort
between Rob, Terry, and I ensued a couple weeks later and by October 1st, we
had said, &quot;This is it.&quot;  http://home.ispi_dot_net/bie/elassley/icsp/index.htm

As the word went out, I put a little effort into making a website to
announce the event
http://home.ispi_dot_net/~elassley.bie/icsp/bustoberfest.html,
had my brother make some commemorative magnetic bumper stickers as well as a
VW sign pointing the way, and a Bustoberfest 2000 parking sign.  Terry and
Linda went together and made some drop-me-dead chili - oh man was it good.
Rick brought a nice big 10 x 20 tent shelter which was our mess hall for the
event and the rest of the crew brought enough food, drinks, you name it that
if you went away hungry, you weren't attending our event.

I showed up Friday evening and I think I was the 4th bus there.  Doug from
Omaha was there in his 72 Riviera hardtop.  Doug has been an OVWC member for
a while but nobody knew he had a camper!  Now that we found out, Doug is the
newest member of our Nebraska Buskateers caravan.  Welcome aboard Doug!

It was really fun watching the busses show up one by one and even a Baja bug
(Morgan and Sandy from Leavenworth, KS drove up!).  We all helped pitch
Rick's 10 x 20 mess hall shelter which fit the length of 3 picnic tables.
Glen Hadley showed a few of us how to start a fire without a match.  I
couldn't believe my eyes - a properly prepared fire using dryer lint, pine
needles, with sticks and then logs went up in flames from a simply boyscout
flint striker.  I still can't believe it but all those years as a scout
master came in handy.  We're still trying to figure out how we can put
Glen's knowledge of nuclear reactors to use at the campsites though! :-)

Rob showed up in his 66 SC and he was wearing an alien mask with eyes that
lit up green.  I've never seen an alien driving a SC before! :-)
Earlier we had PigPen show up in his double cab (which is a mainstay feature
at all the midwest events I've been to.)  Those xx-cabs are neat buses!!!

By around 7 or 8, we had things well underway and had a pot luck of various
items on the tables.  The chili that the Wolfe's brought (terry and Linda)
was outta this world and Pink and Rick both stated that at the campout from
a couple weeks prior in Danville, MO, they would have stood a good chance at
winning the chili cookout contest.  As the night progressed, we sat around
the campfire, floated around from bus to bus in a VW oriented show and tell.

I played a little guitar with Kevin Sullivan (bus wannabe), chatted the
night away with various ones, entertained the crowd with my guitar jamming
in between conversations, and soon we all got tired and retired to our
little bus cocoons.  It was neat seeing the glow of TVs and lights in each
little bus and then slowly one by one, they went out.

Saturday morning we were all up and treated to Glen Hadley's wonderful 1/2&quot;
thick buttermilk pancakes with your choice of M&amp;M's or bacon chips in it.
Pink, Dave, Justin, and I piled in my bus and we headed to the ranger's
station so I could get a ticket to the Buffalo Burger and chili feed later
that evening.  We then cruised the little one-way path to St. Deroin and
visited some historic displays where lye soap and candles were being made
the old way.  Pink started coming on to the sexy middle-aged gal running the
blacksmith forge and there's no telling what he would have done with the hot
dog skewer she made for him had I stepped in and suggested there were more
displays to see.  We visited the old school and store where they had native
fruit jellies and jams for sale.  We also saw brooms being made in the
traditional way.  We never did see the rest of the park but that was okay
because everyone was having such a blast hanging out with each other, the
rest of the park was kind of like an &quot;incidental.&quot;  I played more guitar
that afternoon and had a GREAT time singing and doing 2 part harmonies with
Kevin Sullivan.  Doug was our patient audience for about 2 hours.  He never
offered us any money for our performance but if he had, I would've wondered
if it was &quot;shut-up&quot; money or not. :-)

Some of our posse were saddened by Nebraska's loss to Oklahoma but Rick
savored the moment.  I guess he thought it was good therapy to get used to
your home team losing a game (OUCH!) :-)  Later that evening Rob, Vanagon Da
ve,Kevin,  Justin, I, Jeff Adams and his 2 boys went on the haunted forest
hayrack ride.  The park service ran this for $2 a head.  They herd you up on
a trailer with bench seats and take you down a 1.5 mile or so path and along
the way they have ghosts hanging from trees. people jumping out of the woods
hollering, and various displays meant to scare you.  My favourite was the
headless horsemen on a real horse!  Rob had his alien mask on when he drove
around the park and was an instant hit amongst the park crowd.  We had fun
with the mask because it was SO freaky.  The return trip was even more
freaky with me standing up in the back of the double cab donning the
infamous alien mask.  Later Justin came up with the idea of wedging glow
sticks in the spokes of his bicycle.  That is freaky - you can't see the
bike nor the rider in the dark of night but you do see the twirling lights.
I spooked one unsuspecting camper into blurting, &quot;....what the hell?&quot; :-)

The night wore on.  We had a drawing for various items.  I forgot who won
what but I do know that 2 of the Walmart bus/bug sets were given away,
Morgan and Sandy bought 6 new tubs of axle grease (they heard there are
give-aways at these events so they wanted to contribute), and the 2 vinyl
graphic signs.  I was glad to see that Morgan and Sandy (the baja bug volks)
won the VW sign which we all signed and put what we drove to the show in.
That is gonna be a great keepsake for them - the 1st annual Bustoberfest at
Indian Cave State Park!

The night wore on and one by one we all turned in.  I fell asleep in my
chair at the campfire and woke myself up snoring.  Rob, PigPeg and a coupe
other guys were up past 3 slinging the breeze - savouring what time was left
of our thrilling VW campout.  I had slept in my bus the night before and
elected to sleep in the tent on my mattress - both nights were very
comfortable and I think we all slept pretty well.

To finish things off, we had a group photo shoot and a last minute caravan
around the St. Deroin pass and then we were off!  We stopped briefly to drop
off some fine beer at Glen Hadley's buddie's house 1/2 mile outside the park
(in exchange for some much needed firewood that he had provided for us.).
He offered to let us use a couple of cabins that he has down in a canyon
just outside the park and down in a valley.  I offered to help work on them
between now and next year so that we could possibly arrange to have a
campout there someday.  It would get us out of paying the camping fees or
could be used as a backup just in case the park is ever full.  At anyrate,
it ended up being a good thing that we stopped and visited this fine family.
They are looking forward to joining us in the future.

We stopped briefly in Nemaha where Will (with the oldest bus there - very
rusty but loved and driven) and several of the KCMO contingesnthad stopped
to visit with the farmer he bought his 59 bus from.  He had another late
model Kombi with a crushed roof sitting along the fence row so Rob, Doug,
and I pulled over.  We left after a few minutes and met Terry (who had
missed us at Glen's buddy's house) in Auburn for lunch.  The word came to us
while we were there that we were in a Tornado watch and later this evening
we had a tornado in northern Gage country.  The weather had been nice to use
the whole time at the campout except for drizzle Sunday morning which was
dealt with very well by all the die-hard camping volks.  The air was very
unsettled and weird on my way home.  I would watch the sun pop out from
behind overcast skies and instantly see fog form over fields where seconds
prior was a very light haze.  The bus ran well but handled like crap with a
trailing quarter wind.  I was glad to get home but also sad that the campout
was over.  I had such a wonderful time.

Thanks to Vanagon Dave for driving the farthest distance to be with us (280
to 300 miles from Columbia, MO) and thanks to everyone else for attending
and making this a huge success:  Doug, Terry &amp; Linda, Rob, Justin, Morgan,
Sandy, Pig Peg, Rick, Pink, Will, Jeff and his 2 sons, and last but not
least, Glen, and Kevin.

We had the potential for 3 teams from St. Louis and Oklahoma as well as my
friend Frank in Lincoln and Shawn and Sara Hunt from Ottumwa, IA but sadly
they couldn't be with us.   We also missed seeing Dan Kinsey - our VW buddy
who moved to Florida.  We know he was there in spirit but it just isn't the
same without Dan and his Binz around. :-)

It's at this point that I'm going to strongly suggest that for those of you
who want to get in on a good mid - late fall campout in moderately brisk
weather that is VW oriented, to mark your calendars for the last weekend in
October.  It comes 2 months after Labor Day Weekend and is a last-chance
attempt at a VW event before the winter cold sets in.  Bustoberfest 2000 was
such a success with everyone putting so much effort into cooking food,
cleaning dishes, putting up tents, lending a hand wherever and whenever
needed that you really shouldn't miss it.  I had just as much fun at this
campout as I did at Buses Nowhere Near The Arch - maybe even more because
the weather was not so bloomin' hot - and if that doesn't convince you, I
don't know what does.   Being involved in setting up this whole thing was
absolutely wonderful and I sincerely thank those of you who made it the
success that it was.

Thanks for reading and remember - mark your calendars down for October
26,27,28 of 2001 for Bustoberfest 2001 - See you there!
