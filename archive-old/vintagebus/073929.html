&gt; I am in want of a 12 volt clock and gas gauge. I would prefer not to use a 
&gt; voltage drop. I also remember reading about a person or company that 
&gt; rebuilt 
&gt; clocks to 12 volt specs.

Hi Boyd,
We have used a 6 volt gas guage on a 12 volt system for quite a while and 
only had a problem when the grounding wire from the sender broke and the 
needle in the gauge slammed back and forth till it broke off quite quickly.
  As for the need to convert a 6 volt clock to a 12 volt we can do it, but is 
it really not needed.  The pre-1972 VW clocks are a mechanical clock that is 
wound about every three minutes via a electrical solinoid inside it.  So 
since this solinoid is used for such a short burst a 6 volt one works just 
fine on 12 volts without burning out.
  We do mechanical repair, cleaning, and cosmetic repairs (We now have 
replacement lenses for 1961-67 bus clocks!) to VW mechanical clocks for 
$80.00 including return shipping.
  If you want to have your chrome pieces removed from your clock and shipped 
back to you for rechroming at a shop near you add another $5.00.
