Interesting.  I usually associate these noises with throwing a belt,
but presumably you've already checked that.

Do you hear anything if you coast with the engine off (like, say, down
a hill in a parking lot)?

Did you feel any kind of lurch or other handling anomaly when the bang
occurred?

Check the tranny oil level, just on general principles.

This is starting to sound esoteric, so let's try some of those things:

- the bang could've been a rock hitting something.  Are the axle tubes
  ok (including the parts hidden by the boots)?
- you say you checked the brakes.  did that include verifying that the
  brake plates were still flat (i.e., not bent and slightly rubbing on
  the hub)?
- when you pulled the rear drums, did you verify that there was no
  slop in the bearings (i.e., the wheels didn't wobble on the shafts)?
