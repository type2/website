Subject: re split window

Well, now I'm really upset! My 63 double cab is a factory 12 volt. It is a
TRUCK, not a bus but when I go to a show, do they have a class for TRUCKS ?
No, they put me in a class with 300 BUSSES and I don't never win nothing.
whimper, whimper, whine.

Who is coming to Eureka Springs, Arkansas this year to the biggest, best VW
show in this part of the world? www.nwavwa_dot_com
