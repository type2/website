Subject: Early Transporter brochure [WAS:  selling to the japanese]
Date: Thu, 28 Dec 2000 00:40:17 -0800

I don't know if anyone noticed, but...

If you go to their &quot;Pamphlets&quot; page, Pamphlet 1 is a VERY early Transporter
brochure.  I couldn't find a legible print date, but the List's Barndoor
experts ought to be able to puzzle out a model year.

On the front cover it says &quot;EINE BILDSERIE&quot;.  My German is totally rusted
out, but could that mean something like &quot;First Model Year&quot;?

On the back cover there's a line indicating that this particular
brochure/pamphlet is a [with permission] reprint.

Regardless, the illustrations are pretty interesting.

FWIW.....
