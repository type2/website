Subject: 009-&gt;010, HB contol arm swap, thermostat soup

tinkered with the 65 westy today, what i did and what that did:

changed the heater box control arms, you know, the bits on the heater box 
that you attach the heat cable to (or tie open as the case may be).   I had 
run across a refernce in the 63 ed type 2 workshop manual, and dug in my pile 
of heater boxes and found arms with 2 holes, the slightly higher ones being 
the ones I wanted to use.   It was pretty easy to do, push the arm into the 
heater box at the center pivot where the spring is, undo E clip, pry top clip 
back a bit, slide arm off.  Slightly trickier to change them under the bus, 
but only cause the dirt aimed for my eyes.  Undid the 8mm clamp nut for the 
heater cable,  pushed the arm in at center, pried the E clip out of there 
carefully not losing it.   :)   used a thicker screwdriver to pry the top 
push on clip back a bit, wiggled arm off.   greased the stub on the HB.  
(grease is good.  grease is your friend.  your bus loves grease) (grease 
loves your hair- wear a hat)  one end of the spring goes in a hole in the HB, 
the other end hooks on the control arm.   wiggle that in place, hook the 
prong end of the CA on the top stub, wiggle the middle bit onto the lower 
stub.   Now the tricky part is wiggling that in enough (wants to stop on 
sproing coils) to get the e clip on.  push e clip on, and pull the CA out 
enough so you know it is on right as the hole flares a bit and will hide it 
when it is one right.  push the top push on clip on (fingers work, and 
reconnect heat cable.  Took about half and hour both sides.   The ControlArms 
are left or right, not identical, BTW.

Also cleaned up a freshily swap meet aquired thermostat (cooked it in a pot 
on the stove in water and laundry soap, then in fresh hot water, also applied 
old toothbrush to get the grit off)   Yum!!! thermostat soup!!!!!  put that 
in the bus and tossed the dead  permanently expanded one.

after all this talk about 009s,019s,010 distributors, thought I would 
experiment.  So I removed the freshly tuned up 3K miles ago 009 dist, and 
installed the 010 one off the motor for the 61 (as it doesn't have a tranny, 
it isn't driving anywhere soon).  Checked the points first, they looked good, 
a spot in the center, but not offset. reset them a tad, think I had replaced 
the points not too many miles ago on it. Had a good O ring on it too.    Put 
it in the westy, and installed a shiny new cap.   (I also replaced the coil 
band , now have a pretty cad plated one with a pretty VW emblem and p/n on it 
all shined up- found this in a pile of junk somewhere-looks nice :))  Started 
the bus up and it really didn't want to start, but eventually it did.  
Wandered around the garage looking for my strobe light (I cleaned this place 
up the other day dernit)  and eventually shut the bus off and checked it 
statically- about 40 degrees off, I set it to a tad before TDC, and it 
started really easy.  Backed the bus up, opened the cargo doors and retrieved 
the timing light from under the camper bed.   Yes the dist does advance.

removed the crud fromt behind the bus (including the shag carpet covered 
metal milk crate that came from the 66 westy that is now in No Cal being 
sanded down)(that bus got a refacing seat instead)  And went for a test drive.

1.  more volume of heat when heat turned on all the way, it also turns off 
all the way now   :)

2.  warms up quicker than with dead thermostat

3. better low end acceleration, in fact better power all around, smoother 
too, less of a difference in power across the rpm band.  sounds different, 
&quot;sounds&quot;  slower, but the speedo needles moves quicker with same pedal 
action.  I like it.  just bopped up the road and back, have not done freeway 
on it yet.  Pulls hills at 50 mph better.  Since I didn't do anything else 
tuneupwise at the time to the motor I feel secure in attributing it all to 
the distributor.

will see what happens to the mpg
