DPR makes the cam in a reground only, need someonre to measure it so I can
get new billets ground. Been using them for years, great gas mileage, great
power band, but no new billets

ronnie

ps. No problems with any of the aluminum cases yet except a little clearance
problems with the thrust bearing carrier with a cast counterweighted crank.
Also center carrier needed a little opening to it. I haven't recieved the
4th gen cases yet to see what if any problems there might be. Coming by
truck and should be here today. 2 more days left on the $257.00 dollars new
aluminum case special.

&gt;new aluminum case,

What &quot;fixes&quot; are you having to do to the new aluminum case?


 SCAT 1.10 rocker assemblies and an AC 2 cam
&gt; (airplane grind).

Who makes this?  Why this cam?
