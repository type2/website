&gt;I have a better idea!  Hook your two buses together like they do with
&gt;locomotives, creating a *consist*.  Twice the power (Ok, technically
&gt;not twice...), and you can shut one bus down if it poops out on the
&gt;way.   Or fire up the second bus when going up grades!

Hey, why not run all the engines all the time?  If one loaded Barndoor
can make 50 MPH, two hitched together ought to get 90 easy.  At that
rate you only need about 18 to 20 Buses in the consist to go supersonic.
(You should have Z-rated tires before attempting this) Gas stops are kind
of interesting though, and if you thought synchronizing *dual* carbs was
tough...  I can see this catching on as an interesting alternative to
busavaning to major shows, though.

&quot;Come on and join our convoy, ain't she a beautiful sight...&quot;
