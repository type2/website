Subject: Re: [VB] 68 Puck...  plus

&gt; Also this is a super stretch, but has anyone seen a VW bus pulling a
&gt; Airstream Bambi 16-17' trailer?   They are light for what they are, but
&gt; probably too much for a VW at about 2300 pounds..?

I have seen that now that you mention it. Super stretch is about it, too. My
67 bus pulls one quite a bit. Braking isn't too tough, the trailer has
electrics, bus has &quot;fat-chick&quot; discs. The Airstream ads claim you can pull
it with a bicycle and I believe them. Unladen tongue weight is about 200
pounds, which isn't much. Of course once you fill the water tank, that
becomes about 350, then you probably want to pack some food and gear in
there. It pulls hills pretty good with the 5.7 liter, but 2.0 liter might be
a tad small if you ever want to climb one. I've chased after Ellis in the
RFH with the Puck, it scooted pretty good even up hills. Airstreams are out
of range for all but the longest and heaviest buses, besides the fact that
it would look really odd. The 17 foot Airstream is longer, wider, and higher
than a bus by a couple of feet in all directions. Look like a loaf of bread
shi**ing a watermelon.
