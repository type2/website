what, if any difference(s) is there between the 64-67 gearboxs, and RGBs? 
assuming the units in question are standard units, and not an alpine box, etc.
Hi Robert,
The 1964-65 1/2 boxes have no rubber snubber on the top of the axle tube.  
The only good way to tell RGB ratio after all these years, miles, DPOs and 
possible rebuilds is to take it apart or count gear teeth through the fill plug 
hole.
