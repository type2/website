Hi Michael,
Actually it will wear out your differantial way sooner than normal.  Best to 
remove engine and slide out the tranny and replace the axle tube and 
everything else outside of this.  If the brake shoes on that 36mm side are 
the same width and diameter as the other you have some 1963 only one ton 
suspension pieces there.  If so you can reuse the brake backing plate and all 
the brake pieces on it except the brake drum which would have a part number 
with a &quot;D&quot; at the end if it is a 1963 one year part.  If you do have 1963 one 
ton suspension pieces we would like to trade those pieces off of you.
