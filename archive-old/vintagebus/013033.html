hey Steve et all
sorry fo da non bus content
I must have given the wrong impression that I am indeed a teacher. I am
in contract negotiations now and I am certainly NOT angling for a English
teaching position. I applied at a private school for janitor/substitute
teacher and the superintendent called and asked if I would consider
teaching. 
Hawaii's economy is the worst of the fifty states and I  jumped at the
chance for ANY employment.
as far as a lots of things check out the resume.
