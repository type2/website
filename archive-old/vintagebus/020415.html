Subject: Friday Vicegrip Question
To: Bus List &lt;vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

I asked the question about who had left their
vicegrips on the clutch cable accidentally when
adjusting their clutch, and thought you might be
interested in the responses.  I didn't get many
answers, but some were interesting.  The best response
was the fellow who said I asked the wrong question.  I
should have asked &quot;how many times&quot; have you left your
vicegrips on the cable.  Another response was &quot;I leave
them on there deliberately&quot;.  

And other than a couple who said they did so, one
person said that she never left her vicegrips on the
clutch cable, but if I'd remember, she'd left MINE on
there after fixing her clutch problem at the post-OCTO
campout at Irvine Lake!
