I didn't believe any damage would occur either when I read it on the list, but
lo and behold, when a fresh-air tube came off of my fan housing during some
highway driving and I pulled into a side street off of the ramp, there were
people flagging me down yelling &quot;engine fire!&quot;.  No fire happened, but where
the oil was dripping from my valve covers onto the heat exchanger was the
place of the bellowing smoke!  I put the tube back on and all was normal,
including my oil drip..

No damage to the boxes, per se, but could ultimately damage the car.  (To the
list:  Anyone ever damaged the box itself from this situation?)

Was Writ:

Please forgive the stupid question. I'm thinking of putting a pancake
bus engine heater blower on an upright engine -- giving me heater
blowers independent of engine speed.

Yes, I will block off the fan shroud openings. 

&lt;snip 1&gt;

But in the back of my mind I have this nagging memory of hearing
somewhere that the heat exchangers might be damaged by this arrangement
over time: the stock setup results in a certain amount of air movement
through the HEs and the blower-only arrangement will eliminate this. 

&lt;snip 2&gt;

Anyone else hear of anything like this?
