I just passed this crew cab last night and thought I'd post... I don't know
what year it is, but I do know that it is in pretty good condition.  It's
red and white with black interior, looks like the interior has been redone,
if not, someone took really good care of it.  Dash is original, ragtop,
everything looks really good.  No price indicated, but here's the number
(650) 520-6398.  I've left a message to get more info.  I would be willing
to be a go-between if you're out of the area.
