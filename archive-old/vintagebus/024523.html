Subject: re:pertronix

Hello all,
I have been reading the posts about the pertronix ignition.  Thought I
would share my experience. They work very well.  One thing though,  if
you check timing with a timing gun, Do not hook up the timing gun leads
to the coil for power.  This robs the pertronix of power and I have had
2 sets go out because of this happening.  Make sure you get your power
lead straight from the battery.  Other than that, they work extremely
well.
