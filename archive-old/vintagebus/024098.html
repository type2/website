Subject: Re: crewcabs for sale

To S.G. in Benton Wash. Cut the bull and fly to phoenix and rent a
car and drive to Jerome. If you want a crewcab and will pay a fair
price you will drive home from Jerome with one. There will be a bunch
of them there (you already know of a couple), so fly in, drive home to
Wash. state. in your new crewcab. CASH TALKS at JEROME!!! See you there.
DRIVE YOUR BUS TO JEROME, TRAILORS ARE FOR BOATS!!!
