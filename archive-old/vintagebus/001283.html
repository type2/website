Hello All,

This is not an endorsement, but FYI I just came across a new website that
may be of some interest, www.valuparts_dot_com.  It is a free computerized
service that allows you to input the year, make, and model of your car and
search from a list of parts.  I tried asking about a few parts for busses
and bugs, and had some success.  Mostly it gave me a few junkyards in
surrounding states that I can call to ask for more specific parts.
Unfortunately, it does not currently list cars before 1965, but I sent an
e-mail asking them to consider expanding their service when they are able.

At worst it is an interesting service, and their server returned very fast
responses.  Time will tell if they are accurate, etc.  They even offer maps
to the junkyard.
