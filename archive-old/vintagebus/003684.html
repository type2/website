Subject: [VB]  Seeking a door panel

Hey Volks!

Time for an of-course-not question.  I'm starting the restoration of my '61
15-window Deluxe.  The interior panels are not only original and complete in
number, but in great shape...  save one.  The driver's door.  I really need
both, as someone decided a stereo speaker would look great in the middle of
the panel, so I'm looking for both.  The catch is, this is the early '61
interior panel, so it seems a little more difficult to find than most.
('59-early '61).  I'm in no way an expert, I'm just passing on what I've
heard.

I'll take a repro, but it would have to be good enough to match the
existing, and though they're in good shape, they may need to be paired with
an aged original.  Any thoughts, anyone?

Thanks
Adam
