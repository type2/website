&gt;There has been alot of talk about engine heat lately.  One question was not 
&gt;answered: How do you know if your engine ('71 Type 1 1600 DP in a 66 bus) 
&gt;in your vintage bus is too hot WITHOUT GAUGES?  Is Muir's suggestion of &quot;If 
&gt;you can hold the dipstick in your hand for a couple of seconds without 
&gt;burning your fingers off, then your engine is running cool enough&quot; an 
&gt;accurate standard by which to measure?
Anyone have any other little tricks for estimating engine temp??

Clara likes to spit on the case and if it dont sizzle it aint too bad!

By the way, it's like 90 degrees in southern ohio today, and boy would it be 
nice to have crank down windows!!!

I always have wanted to make a little air deflecter for the fresh air vent. 
Bassically what I envision is a little rounded &quot;scoop&quot; that would attach to 
the place where air flows out the sides of the vent. This way air would come 
down on your head instead of going towards the windows. And we all know that 
a cool head is a happy body.....or something like that.
