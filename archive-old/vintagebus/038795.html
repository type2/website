Thom, your reply confuses me a little. I don't see how I reduced the material for the valve to ride on. I didn't score (or knurl) the inside of the valve guide; I scored the outside of the valve guide before putting it back into the head. 

I had reservations about doing this because I don't know how the aluminum and brass act when heated together; that is, I don't know if the aluminum expands more or if the brass does; I'll assume the brass does because it's a heavier metal...but I didn't do well in chemistry.

Oh well, I can't be any worse off than where I started, which was with a head I can't even use as a spare. The thing I need to figure out now is whether I need to toss this one under the seat for a roadside emergency spare, or if I should run it, figuring to get some more miles out of this head.

HINT: I need to get 3000 miles off of *something* in a couple weeks. Good advice appreciated.

Thanks! Joe

I remembered Bob taking about scoring metal to raise it a little. I didn't remember the context, but I knew this was probably a good application of that concept. So...with nothing to loose, I tried it. After a couple of failed attempts--do not use a hammer directly on the guide as this bends it slightly; use a block of wood and light taps--this is what I did:

&gt;Sorry, but your fix is not going to last very long.  What you did is referred to
&gt;as &quot;broaching&quot; and now you have even less material to support the valve stem.
