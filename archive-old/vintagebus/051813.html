&lt;&lt; I've looked in the Bently on how to determine the order of shims.  How's 
other folks doing this detemination without the VW Tool?  Will a simple metal 
straight edge work, keeping it flat against the bottom one and measuring from 
straight edge to arm on top?  Also can Shims be bought from folks like 
Ronnie?  I'm pretty sure I only has a total of 6 in there and the Bently 
refers to using 8 per Pin.
 
 While I'm at it; Is there a difference in the Link Pins?  Top veruses bottom?
  &gt;&gt;
you can do this with the idiot book, and a metal straight edge and a ruler.  
In the dirt, as long as you keep the bits clean.  ha ha.

the link pins are the same top/bottom/ left/right, but YOU MUST keep them in 
the same set of linkpin/needle bearing/metal bushing.  don't swap top link to 
bottom unless you swap all three bits at once.  If your needle bearing is 
bad, you must toss it, and the link and the metal bushing, and insert a new 
(or good used for the cheap) set of three.

yes some have only 6, i noticed that too.  make sure you have the prescribed 
# on the inside, and leave them out of teh outside, as that should not affect 
the final adjustment.  do not use visibly damaged shims, some I 've seen are 
obviously rusted so they are not 0.5mm. that's from lack of regular greasing
