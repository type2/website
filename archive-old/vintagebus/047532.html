&lt;&lt; I recently installed a new seal kit in my left reduction box to stop a 
minor
 but significant leak.  I failed.  Why did I fail?  Should I be using
 sealant?  &gt;&gt;
Hi Michele &amp; Gene,
You need not use sealant especially there.  Once you installed the seal in 
the bearing cover did you install the spacer inside the seal and slide all 
these parts as a whole onto the axle?  How did the spacer look where the seal 
seats against it?  We have had problems with wear or rust causing leakage.
