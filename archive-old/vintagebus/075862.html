&gt;In the past I have heard good reviews of the Latest Rage heavy pulley versus 
&gt;the Berg unit.

In my experience, the GB Achiever pulley is too small for a 1600SP (or DP).
See my 03/18/2001 post at:

Short summary: GB Achiever pulley is too small for a 1600 and may cause cooling problems.

Subject: Gene Berg Achiever crank pulley-wrong size

I cross-posted about this problem earlier.  This is the (sort of) resolution.

Summary of the problem:  I installed a Gene Berg Achiever crank pulley on the 1600 dp
in my 1970 Westafalia.  In part because my fan belt could not be tightened properly
even with all the shims out of the alternator pulley, I checked to see whether the
ratio of turns of the crank shaft to turns of the alternator/fan shaft was correct. 
Correct is 1:1.9.  I had 1:1.6.  This meant my fan was turning too slowly.  The GB
catalogue suggests a cure for inadequate fan belt tension: placing shims between the
alternator stand and the alternator.  I did this, and afterwards the ratio was 1:1.7
with proper belt tension.

What I did: I called GB and the technical person on the phone didn't seem to
understand the problem well, but he authorized me to return the pulley.  I sent a
detailed written description of the problem w/ the returned pulley.  I asked for a
replacement pulley with the correct diameter or a refund.

What Gene Berg Ent. did:  I recieved the following response from Gene Berg Ent:

Mr. Donnellan, thank you for your letter regarding the pulley.  We did some testing as
to the diameter of our pulleys and found that your GB 439 matched our sample stock
pulley we have here in the shop.  After further research we found two different
diameter stock pulleys both being larger than the GB 439 we make.  All GB 439's in
stock have the same diameter as the one you returned, hence the enclosed refund check.
 Again, let me thank you for bringing this to our attention...Clyde Berg.

What next?:  I not sure if this means that all or some GB pulleys are too small, but
caveat emptor.  Meanwhile, I am looking for a good quality, steel, degreed pulley. 
Any suggestions?  TIA

Note: Accd to my research and VeeWee111,
the correct/stock ratio of turns of crankshaft to turns of fan/gen pulley for
1600SP= 1:1.9
1600DP= 1:2 (or 2.1)

Accd to Clara, there are at least 6? different stock crank pulley sizes for different applications. All have the same general appearance and part number.

FWIW, I am now running a setup w/ 1:2.1 ratio, and noticed a significant improvement in cooling.  In the end, for reasons I do not understand, I could not achieve this ratio w/ the stock pulley and had to install a Porche fan/alt pulley and appropriate size belt in order to achieve th 2:2.1 ratio.

Hope this helps someone.
