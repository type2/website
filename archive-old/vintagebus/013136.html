Well slowly but surely I am getting the 67 up to snuff
got the 009 in.  I have found that the engine sounds
much better timed around TDC as opposed to 7.5 or 10
BTDC.  I have test driven the van under all 3
circumstances and like what I am feeling and hearing
at TDC, also the distributor is advancing just not as
far as if at 7.5 or 10.  In all of my test runs (5
miles some highway, some local) when I return I get a
backfire and the engine seems to be running hot.  When
I test stationary after this and pickup the dipstick
it seem to have cooled down.  Is this because it isn't
advancing enough?  So here is where I think I may need
to do?  
Adjust the idle to accept a further advanced timing.
Upgrade gas.
Check to see if the cooling flaps are opening, haven't
checked never done on a Type 1.(How to?)
I am not happy w/the hot engine but the engine runs
well and shifts well.  If anyone is out on I83(MD/PA)
tonight look for a Yellow 75 Camper, will be me and
the Mrs.'s headed to Bucknell (Lewisburg, PA) for her
5th year reunion.  Her friends are staying in dorm
rooms, we're styling in the VW Bus.

Have a great weekend,
