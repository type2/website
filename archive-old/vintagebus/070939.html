Subject: got the man off my back

It seems I have the situation with the city resolved, with some positive
results in the end. The 65 standard went to a list member from the type2
list,  and I'm satisfied it's going to a good home. I hid the 64 in the
garage(what bus?) And put an unkown 36 hp motor I bought at puyallup this
past spring in the 57 to make my claims of driving it weekly seem a little
more beliveable. The 72 panel is hinding behind the costco shelter that the
57 is currently living in and can only be seen from the neighbors yard
directly behind me. But he's an old guy with a barb wire fence around his
place and plenty of stuff out back he doesn't want the city to see so I'm
safe there.

The upside to the whole thing is it motivated me(gave me an excuse) to work
on the 57 rather than the house/yard, The 65 went to someone who will
actually do something with it, and I'm organzied enough from having to cram
all the extra stuff inside that I seem to actually know where things are. As
an extra bonus we where so sick of the whole thing by the time it was over
that we took off to the woods for a week when it was done. Not something we
really had time for, or would have done otherwise.

My thanks to those who offered help.
