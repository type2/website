Well, living in the capital of the great state of California, a breif look
in the white pages reveals the floowing headquarters number for the
California DMV:  916-657-7669.  Seems like a good place to start your inquiry.

&gt;Hi,
&gt;
&gt;I need advise from a Californian or someone with experience importing to
&gt;Canada from Cal.
&gt;
&gt;I am trying to buy a bus from in California and import it to BC. The bus is
&gt;here already but the owner is in California. I have made all enquiries about
&gt;import duties and safety checks but I am concerned about outstanding liens
&gt;and such. How do I check the title?
