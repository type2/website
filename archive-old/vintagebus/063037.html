Subject: re:I suck too! actually camper interior

&quot; Has anyone replaced the 2 piece plywood flooring, under the
vinyl flooring, with one big peice or has anyone cut it  different?

I did this, and used a piece of 5x5 baltic birch, i forget the thickness,
probably 1/8 inch. I put some soundproofing stuff on the bottom from
mcmaster carr. I have yet to cover it again with linoluem type stuff.
currently it has some carpet on it(square samples from my office) and a
piece of masonite on top of that. not sure why i have both, i like the
carpet idea, but the way i use my bus the carpet would get pretty filthy
awful quickly without the masonite.
