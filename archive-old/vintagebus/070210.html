&gt; Hi All,
&gt;
&gt; I'm looking for a favor to help a friend out in Belgium.  My friend
&gt; 'Kurt' in Belgium was looking for a good roof for his double cab
&gt; project.  I poked around here in the states and found one for him near
&gt; San Francisco (Newark actually).  Kurt paid the guy, 'Scott' and Scott
&gt; was to get the cab roof to a container bound for the BBT shop in Belgium
&gt; where he would pick it up.  Fast forward about 6 months and Scott is
&gt; having problems getting the roof to Wilmington CA (near San Diego).

Wilmington is not close to San Diego, IIRC.  It is closer to Long Beach.

This is actually good if the roof is coming from Newark, as it cuts about
100 miles from the trip.
