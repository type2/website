it is an SP set, but that set is not listed in my 67 ed parts list, meaning 
it was not for sale in 67, so I doubt it is for a 64 as they would have all 
the 64 stuff in stock.  the sp sets are things like  the rear axles boots (a 
set,, uncluding a bott, the nuts ad bolts etc) oe a rear wheel gasket set.  
hop ethat helps, maybe someone has a bay list?
