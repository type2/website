Well I would think  a kombi would be commercial, but a westy would be 
passenger.   Dont remember if my 59 westy has sigla or sekurit.

 So then it would be safe to assume that a Kombi would fall under, which
 class?  I guess it's a commercial bus, afterall it has the black vent
 latches.  But it was destined as a passenger bus on it's way to the
 Westfalia factory to get dressed up.  ???
 
 All I know is my Westy had all Sigla glass and *on top* front slider
 latches as there were no signs of any of these things being changed by a
 P.O.

 &gt; THat passenger vs commercial distinction makes a lot of sense.   I 
 &gt; thought 
 &gt; that 61-63 buses all came with the laminated/sigla glass. But then I 
 &gt; heard of 
 &gt; and saw earlier buses with sigla, but come to think of it they were 
 &gt; pass 
 &gt; buses or campers.   56 deluxe has large logo SEKURIT.  60 DD panel 
 &gt; had 
 &gt; sekurit, 60 truck sekurit, 59 panel had sekurit, 59 truck sekurit, 
 &gt; 58 DD had 
 &gt; sekurit- most of the late 50s buses I have had were commercials.   
 &gt; 61 deluxe 
 &gt; has sigla, 61 standard sigla

 &gt; &lt;&lt; Passenger busses from 57-61 were REQUIRED BY LAW to have safety 
 &gt; glass 
 &gt;  (laminates) windshields installed in all EXPORT vehicles.
 &gt;  Between 62-65 the laws became less strict.
 &gt;  Laminated (sigla) glass you cannot drill through without cracking.

 &gt;  &lt;&lt; I don't think it's a &quot;later&quot; thing, I think it's just a glass 
 &gt; option 
 &gt; thing.
 &gt;   My '55 had thru-the-glass window, but my '56 had &quot;on top&quot; latches. 
 &gt;  What
 &gt;  does this mean?  It means that you could use thru the glass stuff, 
 &gt; save
 &gt;  your sanity, and would not have to worry about being incorrect.  
 &gt;  
 &gt;  I remember someone saying those funky windows came about because of 
 &gt; not
 &gt;  being able to drill that type of glass. &gt;&gt;
