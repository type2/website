Subject: Re: [VB] No Charge

I've had a lot of help on this and I want to thank all that responded.
Its raining here and as soon as I can I'll check the regulator number
against the regulator that Jim Arnot says is the culprit.
PS: I hate to lay under the dash with a meter ........... I always need a
third hand to get those things done.

Thanks To All
Stan Wilder
