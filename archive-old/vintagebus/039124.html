Subject: RE: [VB] un-lowering(raising a rear-end and replacing two missing front springs) a '60 single cab

Thanks all for the advice, sorry I was not very specific but I do have two
front springs that have been stored in grease paper and the rear torsion bar
has been re-indexed to lower the truck. Nothing has been cut or welded
(thankfully	!!) What is the appropriate angle and the best way to re-set the
rear torsion bar/arm. The rear arm is under no tension whith the rear in the
air and the transaxle removed.

Thanks

geo

&gt;
&gt; I have a '60 single cab which has been lowered both front and
&gt; rear.  I have
&gt; the two springs that were removed from the front.  I need some guidance as
&gt; to the correct way to restore the original suspension height to my truck.
&gt; Any input will be appreciated.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
