It is more to do with improvements in furnace design than improvements
in PVC. The new furnaces have such effecient heat exchangers that the
get the exhaust gas down to something around 100F, probably less than
the temperature of the hot water you run down the maybe PVC drain. It
is really wet air too, don't dump it in your chimney or let it run
down your exterior walls...
Bus content: PVC pipe is not appropriate material for your busses'
heater ducts. If you have to use HVAC parts on your bus use
sheetmetal. Foil duct tape might come in handy too.

Adrian,

In the early 70's, I tried to use PVC plastic pipe on my 65 bus.  As
Craig
already suggested, it could not take the heat.  The pieces sagged to
the
point where one end came lose and then they started falling off at 55
MPH and
bouncing around in front of other cars as you watched in your rear
view
mirror.  That being said, PVC has come a long way since the 70's.
They now
make PVC that will vent high efficiency furnaces from houses (no need
for a
chimney anymore).  I wonder how this would work, because it has to
handle the
heat from these furnaces.  Anyone on the list tried this type of PVC?
You
guys in Georgia or Aridzona may have trouble finding this stuff so let
me
know if a guy from the northeast can help.
