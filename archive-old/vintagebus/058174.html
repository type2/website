Subject: RE: [VB] Re: [T2] POR-15 questions

The way i do the Por15 is i sand the surface to get most of rust and =
paint
out, then i clean very well with marine clean, two time if possible =
then i
apply por15,  metal ready help but, i used it at first but now i =
dont... if
the area is exposed you have to put a  primer over it because por15 is
sensible to UV

and im real happy with Por15, i wonder why i didnt sed it before!!

 From my experience  I think the marine clean is optional but the metal
ready is not. You also don't have to use the top coat over the por-15 =
but it
will discolor in the sun if you don't.  Just get  all of the paint and =
as
much of the rust off as you can, it can only bond as well as what its =
bonded
too. I didn't do a good job of this in my single cab and patches of the =
por
15 chiped off and rust started again about a year later. I striped the
places I treated on my 15 window down to bare metal before using por-15 =
and
it looked great 2 years later. I did use marine clean where I had used
chemical strippers to remove the paint.

no, the other one

Subject: [T2] POR-15 questions


&gt; Hi all - I've been hearing and reading a lot about this stuff called
POR-15,
&gt; and would like to get the list members' opinions on it.  Any good or =
bad
&gt; comments would be welcome, I just want honest ones.  A concern for me =
is
the
&gt; cost.  According to the POR-15 website, you should use four steps to
prepare
&gt; and finish the surface:  (1) Marine Clean, (2) Metal Ready, (3) =
POR-15,
and
&gt; (4) Chassiscoat Black.  The website lists prices for a gallon of each =
as:
&gt; $28.75, $28.75, $95.00, and $140.00.  Is it worth the expense?  Do =
you
HAVE
&gt; to use all four chemicals?  How much coverage will you get with a
&gt; pint/quart/gallon?  Reviews of POR-15 I've seen are positive, but =
that's a
&gt; lot of money for me on top of the other parts and repairs I'm =
getting.
&gt; Thanks for your advice!
&gt;
