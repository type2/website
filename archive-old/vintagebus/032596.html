Greetings and Felicitations Honorable Bus List Members:

Forgive my impertinence, but I must defend the &quot;Gauge&quot; users on this list,
or, at least my use of them. Living in the desert, I have found that an oil
temp, oil pressure and tack can help you understand what your motor limits
are (Eric &amp; Barb was very helpful in advising me to know where my RPMs are
at each shift speed and &quot;see for yourself.&quot;). I want the fullest motor life
I can get while at the same time, enjoying trouble free miles along the way.

What have been my experience with the gauges? Well, I found that I was over
shifting 500 RPMs before I installed my tack (flickering lights at stop sign
or just around town driving on a warm-hot day). Brought my RPMs down by
observation and the result: Stopped the flickering light in town or after a
hill run in hot outside temps. Valves not tight at oil change.

I found that for me, over 3000 RPMs on a hot day that the oil temps go way
up and oil pressure goes way down. Buy adjusting my RPMs based on my gauges,
I know how far I can push my motor when traveling up a long grade or when I
have to back off on a long stretch of road. I feel like I'm in control now,
knowing that I can adjust to whatever me and my vw my find on the open road.
The gauges react to all variables, load, grade, head wind, outside temps,
which changes moment to moment. With this information, I adjust and keep the
oil temp where I feel comfortable.


&lt;&lt;if your rev's are mysteriously too high, SLOW DOWN.  oil temp too high-get
that 10w-30 out of there and put the correct viscosity in.&gt;&gt;

With respect, the only way to know these things with consistency and
accuracy are with gauges.

Cordially,

Hart Ponder

&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;[...]  i can vividly remember going to jeromes in the past.  i had
driven
there from albuquerque, about 450 miles or so.  i (and alot of others from
albq) had done the usual maintenance stuff and would hit the road.  we'd
make it there, and 99 times out of 100, no problems that couldn't be easily
remedied.  so you think, when all is said and done, it's at least a 1000
mile weekend.  i don't think any of us had any gauges, other than the idiot
light and maybe the occasional tach.  i also remembered the words of a
mechanic from the shop i worked at, and a long-time philosophy of mine: vw
spent countless dollars (d marks) engineering, designing, and deciding what
things a user of one of their cars needed in order to be notified of any
troubles and came up with this result--2 idiot lights.  what good is an oil
pressure gauge going to do when it goes from 40 to 0 in one second?
nothing. by the time the info gets up front, it's too late anyway. or a
head temp--wow! i can watch my motor overheat before it throws that rod
through the top.  it is amazing how many are still running around--with
just 2 warning lights!  anyway, the whole jerome thing is that i'd get
there and after 450 miles of trouble free-ness, i couldn't believe how
people from phoenix (i think about 100-125 miles away)  were afraid to
drive such a short distance and were wondering if they were going to make
it home!  maybe this isn't related or off-topic, but proper maintenance ad
tuning will do wonders you can't imagine.  hell, do they make a gauge to
tell you when your king pins are shot? if you're so baffled by all this
stuff going 'round, either sell your bus or park it until the acid wears
off. drive it!  it's not a ferarri.  if your rev's are mysteriously too
high, SLOW DOWN.  oil temp too high-get that 10w-30 out of there and put
the correct viscosity in.  runs like crap--remove those autolites and napa
points and get some bosch stuff and do a THOROUGH tune-up, including carb
adjust and checking engine electrical systems.  ok, i'm rambling now.
thanks for the poll responses, keep 'em coming.  sorry if this is a friday
posting on wed.
happy bussing, i'll be driving mine tomorrow.&gt;&gt;&gt;

&gt;  As I sit here on my hands and grit my teeth  and type with a toothpick in
&gt; my mouth i wonder what the hell is going on. It is a wonder that so many
VW
&gt; buses are running. With all the what temp, what pressure, what tire size,
&gt; what trany gear, what rpm, it is weird that any are still running. Do like
&gt; volkswagen did and just run it. If the dash lights go on stop and check it
&gt; out. If Volkswagen thought real gauges were needed they would have put
them
&gt; in. JUST DRIVE YOUR BUS TO PRESCOTT THIS WEEKEND AND HAVE FUN. The world
&gt; would have been alot better without gauges, LONG LIVE THE IDIOT LIGHT!!!
&gt; Trust it. If not park your bus and enjoy looking at it. Pass me a beast
Kyle
&gt; and lets enjoy the weekend.
