Hi All,

I posted this last Friday but my email went TU and I lost most everything so
I thought I would re post:

I'm trying to put an old set of wheels on my 59 double cab.  I have type 3
drums on the back so they're not a problem but the front drums don't allow
the wheel to sit flat.

I have some 2 piece empi 5 spokes and og brms and they sit fine.
Ansen slots, raders, and american 5 spokes give me problems.
I hate the thought of a spacer so, how do people do it???

David
59 double cab.
