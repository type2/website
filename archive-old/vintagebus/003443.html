Brought home this humongous trophy...I think that makes 7 now!  I entered as
a daily driver ( chips, scratches, 35,000 miles, etc.) and I don't think
they really knew what to do with me since they had some really pristine
&quot;daily drivers&quot;(???).  The top honor they gave out was &quot;Top Five Best of
Show&quot; so they gave me one of those! Hey you never know...

Hope you guys are doing well...sorry to hear about the deaths in your
family.  It just seems as you get older more of the people you thought would
be there forever  pass on.

Take care and we should see you at Everybus if no sooner.

Gene
