Carb icing?   this happens in cold, damp weather.  To see if it happens on 
your VW, turn on the motor, then go round and watch the motor.  DO you see 
ice form on the carb and the intake manifold under the carb?   this has 
something to do with temperature dropping from the gas being mistuified, I 
dunno, but if you touch the throat of the manifold, it is colder.    

Carb icing is why VW developed the pre heat for the carb after the 36hp motor 
was discontinued, and they work.   In an earlier workshop manual VW responded 
to carb icing complaints with 'so what'.  yes an iced up carb runs a bit 
funky.
