Subject: [VB] 40 hp cylinders????


So thanks to all who have provided info and offers to help - I'm still
trying to figure out what I need.  The PO told me that my 40 hp engine had a
big bore kit - hmmm - I now suspect he was wrong.  I measured the inside
diameter of my pistons and they seem to be 77 mm (the outside diameter is 90
mm but I guess that is irrelevant.)  Anyway,  could these be pistons from a
1300 cc motor installed in a 1200 cc motor with 1200 cc heads?  I think I
measured the stoke and I get 65 mm - but that can't be right - I guess I
measured incorrectly and the stroke is actually 64 mm and that makes my
engine 1200 - but I would like to be sure that these are not 1300 cc
cylinders.

Anyone around Ontario have a set of 113 101 373 reconditioned heads they
wanna sell.  Of 371 A, B, C, D, or F reconditioned heads with short studs
that they wanna sell.  

TIA

JDD,
if you have 77mm cylinders than you have factory stock dimensions. The &quot;big
bore&quot; kit for the 1200 was 83mm cylinders that were honed out 77mm so they
slipped in.
