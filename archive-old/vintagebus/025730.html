&gt; hey all,
&gt; can anyone recommend a good supplier for a set of link pins? mine need
&gt; replacing and i have heard stories of shi**y links and pins out there.

I have been very happy with the Wolfsburg West link pin kits. 
We usually get the spindles with king pins already installed from
Wolfgang, and the link kits from Wolfsburg West.

Just make sure they remember to send teh shims and seal along with. They
OFTEN forget to send the whole kit, and all you get are the links and
shims in the brazillian box. Yes, they are brazillian, but they are well
made and work well....And try to find nos german for under $300...
