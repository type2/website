Subject: yesterday's trip report -run to the res
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com


yesterday I drove my bus too.  It was just past 4pm and time for a run to the 
res. - The Nisqually Reservation that is.   It was hot as heck out, and the 
road had absorbed so much heat during the day that the front floor mat was 
sticking to what was left of the front floor.   The heat is fairly billowing 
at me in waves, through the open windows, around the bus, and back through 
the windows.  It never ends.  No spritzer bottle, no sunglasses, no sunvisors 
(well they are in the back in a cupboard somewhere)  the glare is incredible. 
     I squint and dodge traffic, using the 6V horn, which works in a very 
satisfactory way.   but wait- there is a 
problem!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   that low purr hum is chocking and 
coughing.   PANIC PANIC PANIC  YOURE BUSTED!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the bus is gacking 
and dying and there are two lanes of traffic to the right in rush 
hour!!!!!!!!  

hm,  lean over to the right and pull the reserve knob out, and the low purr 
resumes. 

it was exactly 200 miles from filling up, oddly enough. 

aren't reserve levers cool?
