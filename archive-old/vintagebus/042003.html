&gt; &lt;&lt; Anyway the
&gt;  rubber gasket on it is pretty beat up, is it possible to just get a new 
&gt; gasket
&gt;  and slide it on? &gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; yep.  its like $1.50 or a little more. Ive had this same problem too and for 
&gt; some damn reason it still leaks a little gas and smells, even with the new 
&gt; gasket.


Ive noticed that the vented caps always weep a little. I try to keep the
cap turned with the vent hole to the top. It seems to help a bit
especially when the tank is full.
