Just wanted to make a quick observation about our club's most recent 
meeting (last night).  After nearly a year, it looks like we're 
starting to get a core group of regulars and that's starting to make 
things fun.  Jeff, Steve R., Steve C., and Andy have been hanging in 
there and we're hoping to get some of our irregulars out more often.  
For those of you just starting up a club or thinking about it, it's 
worth it.  Ours is EXTREMELY low-key; so far no newsletter, no 
agenda, no Robert's Rules of Order -- just VW geeks.

We're trying out a slightly different format, copied from the VW club 
over in Pensacola.  Instead of two meetings a month, we'll have one 
meeting and one &quot;tech session&quot; where those who are so inclined will 
show up at a needy member's house and help 'em perform some repair 
procedure - brake work, welding, convertible top replacement (I like 
that one :-), etc.  If you're in the area, consider joining if only 
to get some free work out of us.

Jeff and Steve C. pretty much cleaned out Cam Conger's stash up in 
Bainbridge -- Jeff bought I think 10 post-68 Beetles for $25 each 
(not complete cars, but lots of parts) while Steve scored a bunch of 
pre-68 bumpers, manifolds, cases, etc.  Thus the club now has an 
endowment. :-)

Some of us plan to attend the Pensacola VW show next month, and we're 
trying to work up a caravan and/or campout for the big Dade City show 
as well as the Bulli Brigade (both the weekend of Nov 7/8, I think).

There are a lot of nice VWs in the Tallahassee area.  If one of em's 
yours, or you just like old VWs, come visit us.
