I was replacing a master cylinder and I can't get the top break line off.
Is there a way I can cut it and replace the end, or am I going to have to
buy a whole new line? I have sprayed some liquid wrench on it.
I will have to wait until Sunday before I can try and get it loose again.
It was obvious that the PO stripped it out.   I just bought this new bus
last week and I'm having a hard time trying to figure out what year it is.
If you do a search with Rob and Texas mine is the first one.  I've looked
for a date, and the plate in the engine compartment.  I can't seem to locate
any.  I have a 59 panel and the plate is right there and this new one
doesn't have one, and it doesn't look like there was a place for it.  The PO
thinks its a 61 but I think the rear window is too large.  Is there a page I
can go to that tells me about the different changes by year? Any help would
be great. :)

Thanks Rob
