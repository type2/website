Subject: Re: [VB] pre-67 westy hammocks

The rear pole is 55 1/4&quot; long. If I remember right, the front pole is 49&quot;
long. The canvas will be green and trapezoidal in shape. About a 1/2&quot; shorter
than the poles.

Hi everyone,
Is there a way to tell original material for the pre-67 hammocks.
What is the length of the rails also?

I just picked up one today that is supposedly original material and it's in
near perfect unused condition. Told it came out of a 66 westy. But just want
some list clarification.
The seller wanted $75, but took $50. I haven't seen an early cot in this shape
before, much less the scarcity of early ones anyways.
