Subject: Weird electrical problem

Alright whenever I turn the steering wheel my bus stalls. It will be idling
fine and then I crank the wheel to parralel park and it dies. I have pulled
out the ignition switch and the wires look good (the switch itself is 6
months old) . I have the 67 &gt; electrical diagram but I really do not
understand those things. I think that it may be the horn that is causing the
problem because it used to beep when I turned so I disconected it. Is it
possible that the horn wires may be causing the bus to stall now? Has anyone
ever heard of this, it is really weird. Could it be my turn signal switch? I
cannot think of anyother wires that would be getting pulled or crossed when
I turn the wheel...... Any ideas? Thank you very much in advance.
