Subject: Re: [VB] These VW motors are amazing

Even though the '53 wasn't on the road, that the oil might have been changed
occasionally anyway. No sludge on the strainer and the oil looked dirty but
not what you would expect at going on thirty years. I'll still change it
though....... just in case.

Also gas was only slightly waxy, and not full on varnish....

I know the previous owner loved his two '53s, and I suspect he still
maintained them and started them up from time to time.

Scott

&gt; Point here is there was an inch of sludge in the bottom of the case.
This
&gt; was in 92... and the tags on the bus said 66.    So If I was you, I'd
drain
&gt; that oil as soon as it gets dirty (
