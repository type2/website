I like the long logo on the gates, but I think an additional logo on the 
doors would help balance things out.  Like Telefunken's diamond logo, or the 
Becker note logo.

If you are putting a pseudo phone number on the truck use an old style one 
like Beechwood 45789 or Pennsylvania 6500

My SC has &quot;Live Oak Landscape&quot; on the passenger door.  The place is still in 
business in Berkeley.  I wonder if I ever get them any business.
