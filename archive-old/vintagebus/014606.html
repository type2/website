Thanks, guys. Have a great weekend. Hey, one other thing (I tried to post 
this message to the site, but it wouldn't let me (for some reason). Here's 
what I wanted to let everyone know:
I found a gentleman, recently, who has a stash of bug/bus stuff out in his 
field. Specifically, one bay has some westy stuff (bed, fridge, tables, etc). 
There is a '65 with a few goodies still left. And, lots of bugs... My 
question is this: would anyone be interested in me checking out this stuff 
for them? I know this is a &quot;splitty&quot; discussion group, but I know there are 
plenty of you who have other vws, too.  Pacific NW... near Portland, Oregon...
Jon
