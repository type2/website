Subject: semaphore wiring and the elements
Date: Sat, 19 Aug 2000 15:36:07 -0600
Sender: dworkin_at_village_dot_org


So, both sets of semaphores that I have appear to mount in such a way
that the coil and its connections are exposed to the outside
elements.  Somehow, that doesn't sound like all that good a thing
when, say, it's raining.  Is that really how it's supposed to be, or
are some bits missing?

Thanks.
