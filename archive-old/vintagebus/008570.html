&gt; Anyone have any luck using their AAA plan to move a project car around, ie
&gt; bring one home from a shop?
&gt;
I had my Single Cab towed to the new owner's house with AAA and I didn't
even go with it.  I told them the new owner was my mechanic and he was doing
some repairs.

I also had a Single Cab towed from my old house to my new house, I told them
the old house was my mechanic's house but he moved and was supposed to bring
the truck to my house but he was too busy.  That's why the house is empty.
The driver didn't really believe it, I was sitting there with my
stacked-to-the-roof '55 Kombi full of obvious house stuff.  I think he liked
the Single Cab because he did it anyway after telling me they couldn't move
vehicles between houses.

I suggest telling them your Bus broke down and you were having it
temporarily stored at a shop nearby until you decided the best course of
action.
