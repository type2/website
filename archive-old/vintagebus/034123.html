I do sell a pretty nice fried egg repo for 15.95 a piece, these are of good
quality and sometimes need a little sanding to get a clean fit, or I have
Hella repo's these are better quality but a lot pricer at 40.00 a piece, but
then again NOS i've seen sell for upwards of 75.00 a piece.
Also the fried egg trim rings (fried egg covers are way cool) that our good
friend Beto has, to bad he moved to Texas. Hey Beto ever coming out this
way, how bout towing a bus from Texas here for me?? will pay your gas.

hey guys...
a friend of mine has a bus that has chrome rings on the turnsignals.
These are rings that are the exact shape of the chrome part of the turn
signal lens...except the go over the lens and screw on with the lens as
the holes line up.  These would be a great alternative to buying new
lenses (EXPENSIVE!) as you could just pick up these rings and slap em on
to make your turn signals look new.  I would love to do this...but I
can't find the dern things....
