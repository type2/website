&gt; My 61 Single cab has been converted from 6v to 12v. Can the original 6v

Hi Sue,
We did the same conversion to our 1960 panel camper conversion.  Our head 
light switch ran so hot that a couple of wires going to it got sindged and 
you could burn you finger tips on the switch knob shaft when on!!  You really 
need to check out the headlight rebuild proceedure in the type2_dot_com library 
that Matt Roberds cowrote with us to prevent not only a hot running switch, 
but have much brighter lights.  Also several fuses began to run red hot in 
our fuse box of our 1963 SC when we installed 6 volt 55/60 halogens and we 
had to clean and solder together all the individual brass clips in the fuse 
box together.  The right lower fuse box connection that passes ALL the 
electrical power to the rest of the bus got so hot the plastic of the fuse 
box there sagged and loosened this section of brass clips even more.  We have 
heard from a repair shop we trust that the modern made replacement post-1960 
fuse boxes are made from plastic that has a much lower melting temp than the 
originals!!    Pre-1961 buses need to have all riveted joints in thier fuse 
boxes soldered to prevent the same voltage loss and heating up due to this 
resistance.  It is really impoertant to go through all your wiring and making 
sure everthing is connected correctly, with clean and tight connections.  In 
a 1961 bug we have had in the family since at least the 1970s we finally f
ound in the late 1980s that the head light wiring had been incorrectly 
switched around in one of the headlight plugs.  This resulted in the bug 
having terrible headlights at night, all because the incorrect wiring caused 
both the highs and low beams to function at the same time which caused the 
candle power to drop way way off!!!
