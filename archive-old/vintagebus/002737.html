Hi Everett,

    I've got a 3.88 X .82 &quot;flier&quot; big nut tranny w/ LT195/75/14 in my '66
E-Z and couldn't be happier all around.  Here's what my real world numbers
are: stock 1500 s/p w/ 30 pict-1, stock vacuum advance dizzy (tuned by ear),
cheesy header w/ heater boxes and worn out single quiet pack exhaust
(complete w/ pesky minor exhaust leaks).  My bus has an 8' roof rack w/ side
ladder (which stays on when I drive) and on camping trips will usually be
filled at least half full with assorted camping gear/firewood.  I have
always gotten a consistent 24 mpg on every trip including my 1200 mile Tour
de Cascades in which we crossed EVERY mountain pass except one in Washington
State's Cascade Range + a tour of Mt. Rainier NP.  I just putt up the passes
in 3rd gear _at_ 37 - 40mph and she always gets me to the top.  I think part of
the reason my bus gets decent mileage is the fact that I always drive with
what I call a &quot;reserve mentality&quot;.  Meaning the gas pedal is never floored
and I try to never push my engine beyond what it's physically able to put
out.  There is a point in EVERY vehicle where the accelerator pedal becomes
more of a &quot;volume control&quot; and the mileage suffers greatly.  I could go
faster on the freeway (I have pedal left and it slowly picks up speed when
applied) but why??  If I was in a hurry, I wouldn't take the bus to begin
with. . .

    You'll never hear my say it's fast and actually I rarely drive it over
65mph (usually 60 - 65).  It just purrs along and seems to appreciate the
lower rpms and rewards me for it by getting me places ;-)  Unfortunately, I
didn't take any long trips where I keep track of mileage and such before I
put the new box in since the old one &quot;grenaded&quot; shortly after getting it on
the road.  I would have really liked to give you a before &amp; after
testimonial but all I have is the &quot;after&quot; side of the coin.

I've been running a 3.88 R&amp;P, .82 4th, Big Nut tranny with 195/75 14 LT
tires and a 1776 dp/30 pict-1/stock exhaust for some time in my '66 westy
and the best mileage I can get is 16, maybe 19 with a tailwind on a trip.
My daily commute to work yields 13-16 mpg at a steady 60 mph. I've tried
different jets, carbs, distributors, checking for tight bearings, dragging
brakes, etc. to see if I could push a little more from this combo with no
success.  Even a recent head rebuild didn't change anything. (compression
is close to even on all cylinders-approx 125 psi)
