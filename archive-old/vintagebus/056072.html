Subject: Re: [VB] Berg Shifter?

I ran a short shift kit and a shift extension in my 66 westy, and it worked
great.  I heard someone say once that it doesn't work/cant be done, but it
worked fine for me.  A Berg shifter is nice, but overkill in a bus IMHO.

Subject: [VB] Berg Shifter?


&gt; Quick question for the custom guys:
&gt;
&gt; Is anyone running a Berg bus shifter?
&gt;
&gt; &gt;These have a super duty 5/8&quot; shifter shaft that is extremely strong and
are
&gt; warranted for one year against breakage. Reduces original travel by about
&gt; 35%, 4&quot; longer and about 4&quot; closer to the driver. No more reaching for the
&gt; shifter. All have standard 21.50mm ball for 1960 and later buses.
Originated
&gt; by Gene Berg in 1978. Made in USA by Gene Berg Enterprises. SW 9# &lt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt;GB 6750 66-79 bus shifter. Fits chassis number 216-028-112 to the Vanagon
&gt;
&gt; I figure it might be time to clean up that vague and sloppy shifting in
the
&gt; stock setup...  I got to see a buddies old school EMPI shifter (old and
&gt; good, not the new crud) in a Beetle and it worked amazingly well!  The
gear
&gt; changes were like butter and positive clicks into each gear.  Anyway it
got
&gt; me motivated to try some new tricks with an old bus :)
&gt;
&gt; I know some of you guys are running them so spill the beans if it is worth
&gt; the $ or not.
&gt;
&gt; Also you can get custom engraved shifter handles instead of the standard
&gt; &quot;Berg&quot;...  Like in the movie &quot;Gone in 60 Seconds&quot; I keep thinking &quot;Go Baby
&gt; Go&quot; would be kwel :)   (granted no happy gas in this bus like on that
&gt; Mustang)
&gt;
&gt;
