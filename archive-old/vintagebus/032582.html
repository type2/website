any good insurance rates/companies for those of us who drive our busses
daily?  i have state farm right now, and rachel has geico.  i know it
depends alot on driving records and coverage desired, but i have no blems
on my record and am looking for somebody who gives good replacement values,
and who might have a clue as to what old vw's are &quot;worth&quot;.  thanks.

&gt; I use Hagerty.  They are very easy to set up and quite reasonable for
collector.  Look at their website http://www.hagerty_dot_com/
&gt; 
&gt; You have to have a &quot;garage&quot;, and you can only drive a limited amount of
miles.
&gt; All the talk of smashed buses lately has me thinking of insurance, Can
anyone 
&gt; recomend a good company for collector/antique auto insurance?
