&gt; I really don't know anything about fixing engines.  But I did see a book at

Hi Satch379,
You really need to buy the Bentley reprint of the original VW transporter 
shop manual.

  Any of you have any tips for finding a bus? for around &gt; 1000$(and i need 
&gt; it to be a daily driver, or possible to fix it up) 

For a $1,000.00 you probably are not going to get much of a VW bus.  We 
prefer getting buses with blown engines at low prices and with little rust.  Then 
buying or rebuilding ourselfs an engine for each.  That way one knows what has 
been done to the engine from the get go, instead of a mystery engine.  Then 
you will need to go completely through the suspension, brakes and steering.  
  As for finding a bus it really just depends on you going out a searching 
for one.  Try VW meets, wrecking yards and talk to local VW addicts about where 
they know of old VWs sitting around.
