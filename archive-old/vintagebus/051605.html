Subject: Another Speedo Calibration Question

Well well,

Today looks like my day to piggyback on everyone elses threads. 

I have a lowered bus with 195/50-15 tires and the speedometer reads
about 5-10mph faster than I'm travelling. Some research reveals that
stock tires (6.4-15) are 25.7&quot; tall and mine are 22.6&quot;, which is a 12%
reduction in total height.

It appears to be possible to alter the speedo, but can it be done
reliably? I do like the false sense of speed that I get while driving
&quot;70&quot; in my bus, but would prefer that the odometer be a bit more
reliable for servicing, etc.

Thanks,

~Rich
