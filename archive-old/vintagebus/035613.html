Subject: Re:  [VB] transmision mount replacement
To: csullivan_at_oceanit_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com


Hi all.  Formerly Chris in Milwaukee, I'm now Chris in Hawaii, with a
newly rebuilt engine enroute to Hawaii.

I need to replace the transmission mount on my 65 bus, and wanted to
know how I could do it without dropping the engine.  Any help is
appreciated.

Hi Chris, save yourself the hassle and pull the engine.  brake loose the 
RGBox bolts and lug nuts and the center tran mounts bolts at nose cone and 
the big 27mm ones.  Jack you the back of the bus and put it on jack stands 
unde rthe rear torsionn tube.  Place a rolling jack under the center of the 
trans.   Remove the wheel and RGBox bolts and trans nose cone and rear 
supposrt.  Now you can pull the trans back far enough to replace the front 
mount.  Do the rear ones too.     and while the engine is out...

check your fuel line (old?)  
engine to body seal?
how are your motor oil seals?
changed your trans oil in the last 10K mi?   why not now?   do center and 
both RGBs-its                
                    like a habitrail- all connected fill *after* installing 
new boots if you do that.
trans boots cracked or torn- new ones!    this is so much easier with the 
engine out.

real easy to adjust the valves and change the spark plugs with the motor out.

I was told you dont have to unbolt the axles from the springplates, but the 
guy who told me this had  only done it to bugs, and when I tried with a split 
bus I could get the broken one out, but to install and good one the boxes had 
to move back slightly, which is why I unbolted them.

Plan a day for it.

Clara
