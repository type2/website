&lt;&lt; My favorites are Kroil (hard to find) &gt;&gt;

Not really, just search &quot;Kano Labs&quot; and mail order the stuff.  They have been 
really good to me.  I ordered some to go to my shop, and the second time I 
ordered it, they just sent it with a bill!  Great customer service.

PS  Try Silikroil (w/ silicone).  I'm pretty happy with their products.
