&gt; While looking at my brother's 58 euro westy, I noticed 2 cables mounted near the heat control knob.  I am guessing 1 is for the fuel tap and 1 is for the choke?

You have guessed correctly.


One of my favorite movie dialog sequences, from &quot;Gross Anatomy&quot;
Teacher: Was that a guess?
Student: Was it right?
Teacher: Yes.
Student: Then it wasn't a guess.
