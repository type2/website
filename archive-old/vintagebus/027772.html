Subject: RE: 65 only wiper shafts

Hi all,
I've never taken one apart before, but what exactly is the difference
between 65 and 66 wiper shafts?  is it longer, shorter, fatter? If it's
just a question of length, it seems to me it wouldn't be too difficult
to tweak a 66 repo one to work in the 65.
Just my uninformed opinion.
Jon 65 standard  wiper shafts with very chewed up ends.
