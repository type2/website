Is it possible to graft four rotors (or at least two for the front) from a
newer bus onto a split? Saw buses on Mt. Tam the other day and wondered
about better stopping power and heat dissipation. I've seen photos of splits
with 'euro-look' porsche brakes and wheels. That looks like a huge expense
and a lot of trouble. Any comments on a reasonable cost stock looking swap?

Thanks,

Jeff
