Subject:  spare parts/tools list for traveling.
Message-ID: &lt;edafaf47.247adca5_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

seems that some people like to carry spare parts and tools in case of 
emergency, feel comfortable with doing emergency bus repair, and can 
efficiently pack stuff in a VW.

Others find it impossible to believe that spare parts and tools can be packed 
compactly, and  prefer the cell phone / AAA deal to get it towed to where 
someone else will fix it,

     I don't understand the sneering about it,  these buses are over 30 years 
old, and things break, amazingly enough, even on well maintained vehicles.    
Better to accept this before you are broken down where the cell phone dont 
work and it's hours to a town and all you needed was a fan belt and the tools 
to change it?

 I tend to feel myself that if my points break, it is easier/cheaper/quicker 
to have a spare set in the back, rather than call a tow truck and wait, but 
whatever floats your boat.    Some people don't go far from home, where their 
personal parts stash is nearby, and mechanics and parts sources are known, 
others go hundreds of miles into the unknown territories where good VW 
mechanics and parts sources may be unlocated, and haven't we all heard 
stories of unreliable mechanics?   I developed my toolbox and spare parts 
collection through learning what I could work on and what goes bad in a bus.  
 

I find on a trip I use my tools vastly more in junkyards and on other peoples 
VWs than on my own, but usually some little thing needs doing, even if it is 
just the 3K mile tune up, or a screw loose in the wiper linkage, or tighten a 
door handle screw.     On the other hand  I have even taken a Stihl concrete 
saw with a metal cut off blade on a road trip- runs on gasoline, cut up them 
junkyard buses.  :)    I tend to have a spare can of gas in my bus-   just in 
case.   on a road trip - have the spare parts under the bed in back, the tool 
box, 6 ft breaker bar , floor jack- that stuff doesn't take up much space,  
now add the camping gear, cooler and food, getting fuller,   now add a number 
of people (1 to 5 total), possibly a dog.  okay?   box of tapes or 8 track 
cassettes, right?
