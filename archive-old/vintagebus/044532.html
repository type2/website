Bug-O-Rama Highlights
In a weird twisted way I thought the Barndoor drag racer was pretty cool.  I 
never did see it make a pass though, what did it run?  I saw the Turquoise 
racer!  Yeah Baby!	
Saw Thom's busses but didn't see him (or anyone) nearby.

Talked to list members Jason and Steve about Westy's and &quot;anal trivia&quot;  

Got the long sought after passenger mirror arm for the SC.  Lane changes will 
be so much safer.

Saw my old Westy (how come I had to work on it continuously but the new owner 
doesn't have any problems)?

My Dad found a replacement for a magazine issue that he threw out by accident 
in the late 50's.  It had a cutaway 550 spyder drawing in it.

Bought a Spokane-United VW Porsche license plate frame which is cool because 
I work for United (Airlines).

Sorry guys, but I missed the silicone show.
