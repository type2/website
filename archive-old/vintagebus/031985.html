Hi there, I'm back.  In case you were wondering why I've been so quiet until
recently, 
here's why.......

We left Olympia the Monday after July 4th in Chris' 65 nsr deluxe.  It was
fairly loaded up, as the plan was to go out to the BMW MOA national rally in
Missoula, Montana, he had stuff to set up at the rally.We put the roof rack
from Nellie (3/4 length industrial German) on his bus, and piled up the rack.
As the bus was packed, I expected to do the Junkyarding mostly after the
rally.   

Now for those of you who think I'm a vintage nazi, you'll be amused to know I
just took a long trip in a lowered bus with a fat motor.    Read on....   and
see....
 
Cup holders do enter this story...

So, as I was saying,  we left Oly on the Monday, and drove over the Cascades
and found a nice camping spot near Cle Elum somewhere.   Drank some beers, set
up the old picnic kit- tablecloth et al and did ordeurve trays, very styleee.
The woods were dry and quiet.   It was nice to get out of Olympia, as much as
I like it, it's good to take a break.

Next day found an espresso place in a town called Liberty.  The guy at the
shop it was a general store too,was closing it in a couple weeks and he and
his wife were moving south and retiring.   Real nice guy.    So we putt in to
Ellensburg and find a junkyard.  They had no splittys, but as I walked by a
blue 63 bug, I said, lets see if it has a locking column, as Chris want's a
steering lock in his 61 bug.  Sure enough, it had the coloulm, and the
steering wheel was already gone, so it was easier to get what was needed.

Anyway, one thing that really bugged me on Chris' 65 (needs a name) is the
forward cargo door sticks.   The mechanism did not work pro[erly , so the
check rod did not move enough when you turned the handle.  IMOBO all doors
must open and close easily and properly.  It was also having an intermittant
starting problem.  hm.

Somehow we ended up driving all the way to Missoula that day (it was Wednesday
early am when we got there)  We took some smaller roads through e. Washington,
through some rolling hills and farm country which was very pretty.   And near
100 degrees.   Wish I had a spray bottle.   I was using a damp cloth on my
arms and neck to help cool down.   We had the safaris open (makes it noisier,
but this was the weather for it) and checked out the neat old barns there.
Then to Idaho.   The Bitterroots are gorgeous, but it got dark as we were
going ove rthem, and we saw a couple dozen elk on the side of the road.   Elk
are big.   DO not hit them.   It is bad for your health.   So we had this
hotel room Tuesday night, and went to the rally Wednesday.   (this is for BMW
motorcycles, not the cars BTW).  As this is the bus list,and not another,
I'll edit that part of the trip, but still say that there seems to be a big
crossover between that scene and the VW scene.  A surprisingly large number of
people commented on the bus, said they had had a splitty, and I even talked to
some people I had met at the NW VW shows.
                We set up the bus so the doors faced away from the swap area,
and so the drivers side of the bus was the business side, and the Riviera tent
was set up on the pass side, the kick back and hang out side, which I dubbed
&quot;Cafe Eurotech&quot;, where we drank coffe and beer and had shade.  Did I metion
that it was very hot?   nineties and up to a hundred.  We had incredible
thunderstorms and even hail the size of large peas on day, but half an hour or
so later it was sunny and drying up.  The lightening was amazing.  The
thundrestorms at least brought the temp down to the mellow low eighties.    

So we left the rally on Sunday,and sent off most off what was not sold at it,
giving space for hauling VW stuff to be found, if it be found.

End of part one...

Clara
