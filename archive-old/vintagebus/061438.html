&gt; Don't know if this will help....but I've got flex hose from the tank and
&gt; then like a 1 foot piece of metal line that goes through the firewall. I cut
&gt; 2 one inch pieces of flex line to use as 'grommets on either side of the
&gt; firewall via tip from erid&amp;barb I believe(just keeps it from sliding).  The
&gt; rest of the the engine bay is flex line.

Another tip is to use brake line in place of the original fuel line.  It's
thicker.  For the tin grommet, I use a 2-inch-wide piece of inner tube
rubber wrapped around and around the line until it is slightly larger than
the tin hole  Shove it through the hole and you have a long-lasting,
fail-safe grommet.  I've used the current one for 5+ years and it is still
in good shape, and if it fails it will start on the outside end where it
is visible.
