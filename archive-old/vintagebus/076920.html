Subject: Re: [VB] Freedom Camper

Tommy,

Freedom Camper was another camper conversion company based in CA, LA area I believe.

The 'snowtop' campers that you see every now and then are Freedom Campers.  That top was an option for that company.

They had some cool features, but mostly similar to Sundials, EZ's and Rivieras.  If I remember correctly, it had a tall cabinet behind the drivers side bulkhead instead of a jumpseat.

If you are heading out to BBB in Havasu, I'll bring the Freedom Camper brochure (copy) with me.

&gt; So, I just recieved the original bill of sale for my '67 bus.
&gt; 
&gt; Apparently, it's a &quot;Freedom Camper&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; Anybody know anything about this?  
&gt; 
&gt; Searching the archives didn't bear much fruit other than that there may 
&gt; have been only 50 of these puppies produced.
