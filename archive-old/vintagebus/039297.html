Subject: RE: static timing light, make your own...
Date: Wed, 2 Sep 1998 05:34:17 -0700 

Next time you do the static timing on your engine,
listen closely to your points.  There is a discernible
electrical click that occurs at the same time that
the light comes on.  Listen to this sound enough
times and one doesn't even need a timing light.

You probably don't need this bit of advice, since 
you always keep the light in your bus, and it will 
never break, your points never wear . . . .    =8-0
