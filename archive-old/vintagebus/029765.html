Speaking of Z beds...

Does anyone have any pictures on the web of one installed in their bus?
Preferably in a non-camper bus.

- - - - - 
I have a Z bed in my 61 m 130 deluxe.   I got it out of a bay window in a 
junkyard for free!!!  I was thinking of redoing the upholstery as it is 
pretty ratty, but then I tore the bus apart so it isn't going anywhere till 
its gets the rebuildt tranny in and some windows put back in and the front 
end mess sorted out,  change the drag link and steering column.   anyway.  
um.   well the point is that I like the bay window zbed for the non westy 
intall as it is self supporting.  Anyone out there who has slept  on a 
splitty z bed in a bus where the triangle brackets under the flip down are 
missing, has woken up with a big ol pain in the back.     I didn't want to 
install triangles in the deluxe.    All I did to install it was bolt it into 
the rear seat bolt bits-  so easy, no harm done, and when I find a deluxe 
rear seat with the grey upholstery for a april 61 through 64 sealing wax  
red/beige grey bus (please help) I can switch it in a few minutes.   Oh I did 
take the door off to the storage underneath, to let the heat out, and also 
had to cut a section out of the wooden bottom because of the heat dispensor . 
    it is the so42 kind, so there is a wierd gap.  I'd like the so44 or 
weekended kind, the full width, for the bigger bed, full width seat option.  

sorry no pictures.  I may soon get use of a better computer with colour and 
stuff, which will incite me to make a webpage and I can post cool pictures, 
maybe
