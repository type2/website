the following journey was made in a bus with no gas gauge, a broken speedo,
and no other gauges except for the idiot lights:
rachel and i left for octo/classic around 8am and headed toward salinas and
the 101.  about 1/4 mile (luckily) before an exit with a gas station, the
bus lurched, i freaked, and realized i was running out of gas, which i hate
to do.  we coasted to a 7-11 and made it to about 30 feet before the gas
pump.  we got a few (overpriced) gallons and proceeded.
  well, a fairly uneventful drive south turned into a traffic nightmare
unpon entering the la area.  rachel and i were on our way to the campout at
rich yost's complex and were making good time until we hit the
bumper-to-bumper mess.  it took us 4 hours to get from the 405 interchange
to yucaipa--and this was at 2 o'clock in the afternoon!  you la people must
really have some good reason to stay there and deal with that all the time.
approximate driving time, including traffic--10 hours/380ish miles.
  anyway, we finally got to rich's place and set up to camp for the night. 
it was really cool to get the tour of the place and see all the busses and
the diamond-t that await restoration, especially the dove grey standard
that made me really sad, because my flipseat westy was originally that
color, and now it's not.....
  the next morning found us driving as the sun was just beginning to come
up, and after a quick gas/air stop, we were off to the octo show.  jp and i
arrived at about 6:45, and the gates were already open and the swappin'was
happening.  the busses kept coming in all morning, and the swap just kept
growing larger and larger.  i had forgotten how the so-cal swaps to me seem
like a show-and-tell of shiny, nos (meaning &quot;not on sale&quot;!), rare (to me
meaning useless unless you have the unusual car to put it on), outrageously
priced parts, and not the usual piles of &quot;i just cleaned out my garage&quot;
parts i see at other shows around the country.  but there were some deals
to be had, and i did see alot of happy people, even though i did see alot
of people dropping their jaws at the prices being asked.
  it was nice to meet some other listees and to see some old friends, too. 
there were a ton of busses, and some incredible examples of wetsy's, my
soft spot.  
  then it was off to the supposed &quot;toy and literature&quot; show.  yes, there
were some toys.  yes, there was some literature.  most of all it was cases
or tables of super pricey, shiny parts and accessories.  it was fun to walk
around with rachel and roger and laugh at prices and to say things like
&quot;i've got one of those&quot; or &quot;you want HOW MUCH?&quot;,  or &quot;REPRO!&quot;.  the crowd
was almost too much to bear at times.  it was nice to see the stuff on
display, and again to run into old friends, but i just wish it would be a
toy and literature show, and not an air conditioned parts show.
  rachel and i took a very nice shower in roger's hotel room (thanks!) and
then it was off to the vto campout at irvine lake. this was alot of fun,
and would highly recommend it to anyone for next year.  it was very laid
back and quiet, and the view of the lake was great.  the gopher snake
provided much entertainment, as did the crazy raffle later that night.
  the following morning many of the campers went to the classic, while
rachel and i followed jp to ports-of-call in the la harbor.  we ate various
seafood and vegetables and then it was off to jp's dad's house for him, and
rachel and i started back home.  the traffic wasn't bad, but the headwind
was ferocious.  you know it's windy when you must keep your steering wheel
turned to the right while travelling through a left hand arcing turn! we
finally made it back home and after a nice long shower, got a good night's
sleep.
  approximate return trip time--7.5 hours/360ish miles.
  rachel and i will be travelling to the litchfield, ct show next weekend
and then spending a week vacationing back east.  hope to see some of you
there.
