Are there any listees out there in the northern Nevada
area interested in getting together a bus owners (or
maybe all air cooled VWs)group. There are a couple of
die hard bus nuts in the area and maybe just enough
interest to try an orginized event.
A couple of us are getting together this monday night
at my house to (show off my collection)talk about
getting something going. Any interest?
And if any of the 'real' bus groups out there ever
want to have an get-together in Reno, Please contact
me for any info on the area and help with plans.
