Make sure the tow bar you use is heavy duty, lots of cross braces.

if you figure out how far back it attaches you can see that you have a lot of 
leverage trying to bend the towbar , mostly in the turns.

forget about backing up, don't even think about it, look for an escape  route 
before you pull into a parking lot etc.....

Safty chains are a must, I have had a towball come loose off a Uhaul truck 
and the only thing that kept the bus behind me was the safty chain,  

My favorite tow bar mounts to the bumper bracket,its a hassle taking the 
bumper off , but I have pulled many buses the last 400 miles and it was 
smooth sailing.........

Make sure your tow car is heavier than the bus and with very good brakes 
since they have to stop 2 cars now.

thats it for now.........just be safe.....
