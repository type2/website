Subject: Re: [VB] VW People - Friday

Most of them are really kind, love to camp, love to travel, are grease
monkey's to some degree, do-it-yourselfers, and with the advent of Internet,
most of them we meet are computer literate to some degree or another.  It's
a given as that's how we meet most of them.  Just think of all the cool
stuff Internet has allowed us to do.  I doubt that without the net if we
would have ever met any of the cool people we constantly seem to keep
bumping into. :-)
