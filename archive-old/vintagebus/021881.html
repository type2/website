Subject: M108 = Roof Rack?
Date: Wed, 4 Apr 2001 12:29:49 -0400 
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

After logging my bus into Thom's vintage database and reveling the custom
codes... I have a question.

What is a M108 roof rack?  

I have a hardtop SO-42 westi and want to find out what the M-codes
specify...  Most westis should come with the  1/3 rack as to not get in the
way of the pop-top, but since this is not a pop-top I am curious as to what
would have come on there.

Ideally I would like to put a full rack up there because of the super
utility of it....  Finding one is a real pain though...  And for a
reasonable price is another thing entirely.  To me it is worth about $100,
anything over that the utility cannot be justified.


TIA,
