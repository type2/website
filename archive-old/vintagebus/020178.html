Hi,  I'm searching for a good used ready to install small nut
transmission. I'd like one that's complete drum to drum, and affordable.
If you're within a few hundred miles of Fort Worth, Texas that would be
best, but if you're further and willing to ship it that would be fine
too. I've got a complete front and rear end from a 66 bus to trade, or
cash. The 66 front end seems fine but on the rear end I am unable to turn
the drums by hand. Please e-mail me off-list if you have one or know of
one. Thanks-
Chris
