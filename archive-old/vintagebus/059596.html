Subject: Re: [VB] Rap on distributors


&gt;I think carb and dizzy go hand-in-hand,
&gt;joel


yep. different carbs have DIFFERENT VACUUM PORT LEVELS.
look in the (old, at least) bentley, - the dizzy charts will tell you how
far the vacuum dizzy will advance when exposed to -X-  amount of carb
distributor port  vacuum, NOT manifold vacuum.
the solexes have had the vacuum ports &gt;in the throat&lt; moved around a bit if
i recall, which changed the amount of vacuum pulled; also, at least the
28picts had a 'jet' in the vacuum drilling... a venturi, mebbe?  ... and
certain dizzys would no longer be 'right'

shoot, on one page, they tell the serviceman to ream the bejayzus outta the
inlet port and get more vacuum to the can :)


what it means is that you have to find out at what PSIs the vac can on your
dizzy moves, and how much... check that it matches the CARB'S output... and
use a strobe timing light, a tee in the vacuum line that goes to a vac
guage AND the dizzy, and test that the dizzy is advancing correctly.

for starters :)
