Subject: Bulli Brigade caravan
Mime-Version: 1.0

Just a reminder to everyone that Bulli Brigade, the southeast's biggest 
gathering
of split window buses ONLY is THIS Saturday, November 11th at Reeve's
Volkswagen in Tampa, Florida.  This is a great show put on by Das Kool Bullis,
the Florida chapter of NEATO.

Peach State Transporters has a caravan of 5-7 buses leaving Atlanta Friday
morning, November 10th.  If anyone else planning to attend the show is going
through the Atlanta area &amp; would like to caravan down to the show with PST,
you are more than welcome to meet up with us at my place Thursday night
or EARLY Friday morning.

This will be a GREAT weekend with the Bulli Brigade on Saturday and the
Florida Bug Jam in Dade City on Sunday.
