Subject: Which repro Safari's?
Mime-Version: 1.0

Well, I just sold my good ol' '74 Super Beetle &amp; now have a lump of the
profit set aside for a set of Safari windows to go in my '58 Kombi. From
what I've seen on the list in the past few months, It looks like Izzy's are
the one's to get. Has anyone actually bought &amp; installed a set of these?
I'd love to get a set of originals, but it's hard enough to even find a
&quot;splittie&quot; at all in my neck of the woods. Any feedback will be appreciated.
