Subject: RE: [VB] Splash pan question

I don't know. I just checked all my sets of splash pans and I see ribbed
bumper, ribbed truck, non ribbed slash or pointed truck and non ribbed
standerd bus and bay window. I couldn't tell any difference in non ribbed
bumper splash pans.

Subject: [VB] Splash pan question


I saw this ad on my site:
http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/classifieds/index.mv?alert+200210251238510168
where he says the splash pans are for 66-67 pointed bumpers.

Is there a difference?  I though 59-67 were all the same.

Curious,
Everett Barnes
