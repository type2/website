Jon
sounds like you're having a tough time.
What is the rest of the motor like?
i.e. stuck/ loose clearance valves, loose heads, intake manifold etc.
etc.
on the vacuum leak test, you checked the hoses etc. all tight right? did
you let the motor revs down to just-before-die and squirt your carb
cleaner (I hope you are using berymen's not gumout) around the intake
manifold to head gasket ? no increase in revs? good. Did you check power
to your cut-off solenoid with a test light?
don't despair
aloha
