'68 bay middle seat near mint condition as advertised
in AZ Republic newspaper on Friday and Sat in the $100
or less section. They wanted $35 or &quot;offer&quot;. I didn't
even bother to call. I saw it at 05:30 Friday AM and
since having the day off from work could have called
and hauled a** to go get it. 
Is this a sign of complete VW burn out or a sign of
common sense? I had no use for it and didn't know of
anyone frothing for bay parts. We already have lawn
furniture and all of the Jeff Foxworthy video library.
