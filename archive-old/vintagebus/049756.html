Subject: Re: [VB] quick tire question

&gt;Does anybody have experience with 195/75/15 on a '67 tranny? ('61 beater
&gt;with 15&quot; rims) This size came highly recommended by a list member but
&gt;now I's seeing a lot of references to 205s.

THe 195/75 is a smaller diameter than the OEM tire.  205/75 should be about
right, and has slightly more load capability as well.



 I must replace the current
&gt;215s due to excessive wear (that's another story.....) With the 215s my
&gt;speedo reads about 5 mph too high and ride is a little skwooshy (perhaps
&gt;due to height?)


If all is well w/ your speedo, the 215/75 should make your speedo read LOW,
not high.  A 215/70 should be about right.
