Subject: Type 4 cooler and still overheats

I had an over heat problem with my 59 ddr panel camper (1600 SP).  Up
any grade it would warm up and not cool off.  I had coming back from the
classic, getting over cajon pass.  No it is not just the temp guage as
my oil pressure light would come on at idle when I would stop.

  So a couple of weeks I pulled the engine.  I found the original stock
cooler had oily dirt blocking part of it and there was some around the
engine cooling blades.  I figured I had found the problem.  Also the
hold down tab was broken off but it was not leaking.  I found a GEX
metal foil name tag (1&quot; x 3&quot;) sitting between 1 &amp; 2 blocking cooling.

So I cleaned the engine, welded up the fan housing, installed a Type 4
cooler, 35mm fan, high volume oil pump, louvers and a thermostat,
throwout bearing, clutch disc (pressure plate was good), a stock oil
bath air cleaner (used my triangle bracket), new muffler, cleaned out
the fuel tank, cleaned out the crossover preheat tubes, re-torqued the
case and heads, set the valves, compete tune up (all new parts), ran a
hose from oil filler to air cleaner for positive crankcase ventilation,
and a bunch of other little things, like replacing worn hoses and tubes,
filters, air flow seal rubber, replace missing screws &amp; bolts, caulked
all the holes and a few other things &quot;just because the engine was out&quot;.

The installation of the Type 4 cooler was pretty intense with getting
all of the pieces together and installed due to stud length and diameter
changes, drilling out holes, and control arm changes for the louvers.

So yesterday I started it up, then changed the oil after 5 minutes.  Had
a little rub on the fan and I adjusted the generator and it was fine.  I
took it out for a cruise.

It was in the 90's, windy, so I went downtown about 5 miles.  When it
hit 120 deg I checked it and the louvers were open.  It got up to about
180deg - good operating temp.  It sat downtown at a block party for an
hour, then it restarted great and I headed for the freeway.  Through
town the temp headed for 180 again, then 2 miles down the freeway,
slight down hill, wind behind us, it climbed to 200 deg.

I have not taken it uphill yet, maybe this morning.

The cooler seemed clear as I pumped solvent through it for 2 days and it
had good volume flow.

Everything is sealed including the engine door, all the holes are
caulked.  No scoops!

When I installed the oil temp guage I had checked both pressure relief
valves. (type F case)

We checked compression: #3 at 110, the rest at 120 PSI - this was before
removing the engine.

Timing is 71/2 BTDC with Vac hose pulled, goes to 33deg full advance at
1900 RPM with vacum line on.

Any idea what I could have missed that the temps are still going up
fast???

I did miss the fourth bolt behind the cooler tin - being an early case,
mine does not have the captive nut.  Any suggestions on how to get it
in?  Is there a part/source?

TIA
