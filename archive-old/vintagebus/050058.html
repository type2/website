Several of you have been privy to Mr. Dolan's adventures this week, which
have included engine trouble, John Anderson, and coming to Memphis without
my unlisted phone number which caused him to canvass several neighborhoods
until he found one with some crappy buses parked there--that was us.

He is sleeping peacefully in the back yard. We got him a little drunk.
Tomorrow we shall round up Joe's clan and cook roast beasts, we hope.

Low oil pressure, high temperatures, starting problems, excessive
displacement. I am trying to talk him into carburating the thing. Hah!
