Fellow Bus Heads,
There has been alot of talk about engine heat lately.  One question was not answered: How do you know if your engine ('71 Type 1 1600 DP in a 66 bus) in your vintage bus is too hot WITHOUT GAUGES?  Is Muir's suggestion of &quot;If you can hold the dipstick in your hand for a couple of seconds without burning your fingers off, then your engine is running cool enough&quot; an accurate standard by which to measure?  Anyone have any other little tricks for estimating engine temp??  By the way, it's like 90 degrees in southern ohio today, and boy would it be nice to have crank down windows!!!
