Subject: Re: 9-PIN conversion and #559 flasher

&gt;Small question here:
&gt;Basically would a #550 flasher do the same thing?

It will work, but the pilot light in the speedometer may not work
exactly the same as the original.  From later in the article:

---
In case you're wondering about the &quot;exact functionality&quot; part, it has to
do with the indicator light in the speedometer. Originally, this light is
on when the outside turn signal lights are on. If you use a generic
3-terminal flasher, the speedometer light will be off when the outside
lights are on, and vice versa. The #559 flasher has a separate set of
contacts for the indicator light, which lets you wire it to work exactly
as the original.
---

With the #550, you may also find that the pilot light in the speedometer
glows with the turn signals off.  A bit more rewiring will fix that.

&gt;I went to NAPA yesterday and they said that they no longer carry a #559,
&gt;but a #550 is the same thing but carries more amperage.

NAPA guy is 0 for 2.  The pilot light circuit on the #550 works differently
than the one on the #559.  The #550 is designed for American cars where the
pilot light is connected between the flasher and ground.  The #559 matches
the original VW setup where the pilot light is connected between battery
voltage and ground.  As for the rating, the Wagner Lighting catalog says
that both #550 and #559 are rated the same: 2 lamps _at_ 32 candlepower each
for turn signal (4.2 A) and 6 lamps _at_ 32 candlepower each for hazards.
Both have lamp outage indication.

&gt;Both are canister style thermal contact flashers so I cannot see a
&gt;difference at all?

A 36 hp and a 1600 DP are both 4-cylinder boxer air-cooled engines.  :)
