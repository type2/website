 Ahh yes,
 
 But in the climate of the times, different abbreviations and gestures mean
 different things to different people.  Make a peace sign, point your palm
 toward your chest and pump it back and forth.  In the us people will think
 your a dislexic hippie, in england you are telling them to eff off, and
 they will probably beat your ass if they are a soccer hooligan.
 
 so, i think OG means original in the collector car arena, or at least on
 this list..
 
 take care,

Reminds of something I saw in a newspaper.  The differnt between the peace 
sign and the eff off is which way the hand is turned.  as you know, the palm 
faces out wards in the peace sign.   

soon after the Berlin wall fell, there was a picture in the paper of a man 
glaring through a hole in the wall making a 2 fingered gesture.   The caption 
read something like &quot;East German makes Peace sign through hole in Berlin 
Wall&quot;  However as the back of the hand faced the camera, the caption writer 
had quite mistaken the message he was being given.  Wish I had cut that out 
and kept it.

but a lot of neat old buses have come out of east Germany :)  (OBC)
