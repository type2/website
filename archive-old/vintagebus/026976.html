Subject: 67 Problems

My 67 Bus wanders on the road, I know it is in need of a front end
alignment, but wherever I go they tell me that they can't do cars this
old. I went to a VW dealer and they said that no adjustments could be
made, but the Bently manual says otherwise. What should I do?

    Another problem that my Bus has is that it list to one side,
actually the rear left corner. What could be causing this? The car has
new shocks and the tires are filled.

Thanks,

Chris
