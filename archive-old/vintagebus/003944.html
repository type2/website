Subject: Re: [VB] '67 kombi radio questions
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

The Westfailure came with a Sapphire VIII. AM and 8-track. Traded it off for
some cracked taillights a couple years back. No, that wasn't the original
deal, just some folks way of conducting themselves. Yes, the 67 had a
block-off plate. Same as on the 67 bugs, only the bugs have a silly piece of
chrome on it. They're worth about 5 bucks, that's what I paid for the last
one I bought. I see some folks that think otherwise. Guy I bought one from
had a beer case full of them, must have been a hundred. He's probably
sitting back and putting his kids through college selling them one at a time
on e-Bay now.

&gt; Howdy,
&gt;   What radio came with the 67 buses?  In the archives there seemed to be
&gt; some difference. I saw sapphire 3 and 5. Also was there a radio block off
&gt; plate available in 67 and was it different?  I noticed some of the
&gt; aftermaket ones say thru '66.
