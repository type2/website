Subject: RE: [VB] welding prep advice

  It all depends on the size of tubing you are trying to cut the fishmouth
in. I have a manual notched I use for 1 to 2 inch tubing. On places where I
need exact cuts I use a barrel disc sander with replaceable sleeves that
come in different grits in my die grinder. On smaller tubing I use a die
grinder (metal) bit in a drill press with a sliding vice . If I feel really
industrious I will set up the mini mill for multiple cuts using an end mill.

Well this weekend I will be working on a little project for the westy.
Gonna work on that roof rack I've been meaning to do for a long time. 

Welding the tubes together is no prob. cutting them is no problem.
What I'm having trouble w/ is cutting the butt joints. I need to be
able to (hopefully quickly) cut a simi-circle in the end of some of
the tubes so that making a tee w/ two tubes is possible and close
fitting before welding. 

Anyone have any suggestions? The best results from what I have tried
have been from a hole saw, but it's honestly not very good. the hole
saws I have found really don't have enough teeth to keep the
vibrations down. Angle grinder works ok, but I cant' really get a good
finished end. I had thought about a grinding stone in the correct
diameter, but haven't tried that.

comments, suggestions and plain old encouragement welcome. I'd like to
have room to put more stuff on our next trip, hopefully Missouri Bus
Fallout.
