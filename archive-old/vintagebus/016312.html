Hello Listees,

I will be making a trip out to the LA area this week, and I was hoping to 
pick up some parts on the way (coming from Salt Lake, I-15 all the way).  I 
checked the show listings on everett's site, looks like nothing is going on 
in SoCal.  I specifically am looking for a passenger side cab door for my 
'64 splitty (flip-out handles).  Anyone out there know of good junkyards I 
could hit, or know of where I could pick one up?  I will be there for a 
week, and I'll have time to carouse around a bit.

Thanks!

Mike Anderson
'64 SO-35
