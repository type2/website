Hey I have a friend that has a 76 bubble window that the timing keeps
slipping on. You can time it and about 20 miles later, the timing is off
again. we've done it twice now and it's off again in no time. it has an
2000cc motor in it and everything is completely stock. I don't know too
much about fuel injection (after all, I'm on the VINTAGE bus list for a
reason), so I told her I'd give her a hand if it is in fact a bad
distributer. another question, will a 009 work in a 76 bus? I have 2 or 3
laying around that I can give her if they'll work. She also says it's
running hot, but I guessed it's because the timing's off. I think I'm on
the right track, I just wanted somebody that's dealt with type IV's to
re-assure me. Let me know if I'm way off, and tell me either way what to
do.
