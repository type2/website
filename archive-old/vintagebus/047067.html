&gt; the cable through. Next, I have to tape heavily around that area to keep
&gt;  crap from getting in through my cut, but not yet because the cable WAS TOO
&gt;  SHORT. :-(  I took the cable out of the 1971 bus but guess the 69 model is
&gt;  different. Can anyone confirm this? It needs to be about 1 cm longer. Some
&gt;  wire fixed that for now but the engine would not start, and gas was leaking
&gt;  from the lower linkage and dripping off the area where the cable attaches.
&gt;  Is that a common problem in a engine that has been sitting for a long time?
&gt;  I put another carb on and that baby roared to life. Looks like I will make
&gt;  HCBF after all. Still have a lot of work to do but I will make it.
&gt;  
&gt;  Thanks and any further input appreciated.
