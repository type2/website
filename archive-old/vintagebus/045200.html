 Quite an understatment, clara.  I'm picking folks brains, snatching up
 bits and pieces as I go along, printing little M-Code analyses like
 yours and trying to collect them in the NEATO Registry database.  There
 are several where I have two different meanings for a particular code.
 
 That's not to mention the pregnant M-Codes that have babies...like
 430=North American Model with 020,024,025,090,175 and 620/621.

well, I could go and cross ref with dif list and let you know what I find.  I 
do realise that some of the 'pregnat' (chadlike) m code encompass a litter, 
such as is wierd in that my 65 has the individual ones EXCEPT the laminated 
windsheilds mcode, yet has no safaris m code yet had OG safaris with plate.  
has 175 020 024 etc  

very curious as to  your findings on changable M codes.    

heard that the port codes were changable too
