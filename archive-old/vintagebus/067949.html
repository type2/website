&gt; What do you folks think mught be the problem??   Any insights would be
&gt; really appreciated.

Hi Bob,
Definitely sounds like the clutch cable going bad.  The &quot;ping&quot; sound you 
heard was the cable losing several strands in a snap.  Now the remains of the 
clutch cable have stretched causing the clutch adjustment to be out of wack.  
You could adjust the remains of the cable, but the rest of the cable will 
give away at any time.  Give your parts shop another call and have them get 
you two cables and get a gas pedal cable to boot.  That way you will have 
spare parts stash started for your bus.
