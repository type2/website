Subject: Re: [VB] Another burnt VW bus!

Don't know if this will help....but I've got flex hose from the tank and 
then like a 1 foot piece of metal line that goes through the firewall. I cut 
2 one inch pieces of flex line to use as 'grommets on either side of the 
firewall via tip from erid&amp;barb I believe(just keeps it from sliding).  The 
rest of the the engine bay is flex line.

This info might do a little for ya;)

&gt;
&gt;I know my bus is wrong, but what should I do to make sure my fuel lines are
&gt;safe?  I am not bothered by originality just want my bus to be safe.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks
&gt;Paul
