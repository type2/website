Let me add to what I said by this:
I bought a bus with a Tom Noble rebuild at 45,000 miles. Pushing a 69 westy 
that occasionally pulled a boat. I used it for about 10,000 more miles, then 
set it aside. Outside. It sat outside 2 houses for about 3 years. Then I put 
it in the 63. All sorts of brown foamy stuff happened for awhile (water in 
the block) then went away. I dont really know how many more miles went on it 
but I was driving to seattle from OLY 2 times a month plus daily driving for 
another 3 years. Thats at least 240 miles/month, plus I took it to Wyoming, 
on a long exteneded trip.

Anyway that must be another 30,000 and its still running strong.

Jason
