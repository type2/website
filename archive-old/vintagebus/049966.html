Subject: Another '67? Westy available

Here is one I forgot to mention.  A couple of months ago I was driving past
a local junkyard and I spotted the distinctive late split Westy pop top
amoung a sea of boring wrecks.  I inquired and was escorted (yes, it's THAT
kind of yard) to the bus.  I didn't check out the year, but it's got to be
a '65 - '67.  It was hit pretty hard on the right side, right front corner,
and right rear corner.  I think it's fixable though.  It was Washington
plates, and looks to have been restored.  Recent red paint, white above the
beltline.  I didn't look under, but it didn't look like a bondo bomber.  I
looked in the windows and saw what looked like a complete Westy interior.
The engine is an original 1500, w/governor, if memory serves.  The owner of
the yard seems to know that splits are appreciating (unfortunately), and he
was unwilling to sell parts.  He thinks he will get more for the whole
thing, if he can find the right buyer (he's right, IMHO).  I think he wants
$500 - $1000, but I'm really guessing.  I can get the phone number of the
yard if anyone's interested.  It's called Action Auto Parts, located on
Arlington Street in St Paul, MN.
