&lt;&lt; Are 62 slider latches/assembly a one year only part?? &gt;&gt;
Hi Isaiah,
If you mean the type that do not bolt through the slider glass they seem to 
have been used off and on from 1957 and then they were factory installed in 
1962 in all the buses for here in the USA.  1963 they were discontinued 
apparently when USA laws for laminated glass in the side windows were dropped 
so VW went back to tempered glass in these areas.   Eric&amp;Barb
