&lt;&lt; What's a good CB antenna to mount on the front of the bus?  I'd like
 something that's not too tall (as to not look silly and/or cause clearance
 probs), provides good performance for the price, and doesn't require a hole
 much larger than for a regular antenna.  I'd rather not use a magnetic
 rooftop antenna.  The Westy already has an antenna on it so I won't be
 making any new holes.  The hole in the Kombi is bondoed over so I'll just
 take a screwdriver and knock it out ;-)
 
 Thanks for any help!

Hey there good buddy! You can run antennas on a bus like I run on my 
Freightliner. If you got yourself a roofrack then you can run dual antennas, 
one on each corner of the rack, I got mine on my mirror bars on the 
Freightliner.
  10-4 over and out, see ya on the flip flop
