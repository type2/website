the gun I'm using is different from my dad's but I think I did it right. It 
has a dial on the back that I had to set at about 5 or 6 to get to TDC at an 
Idle. Then I reved the engine and found my total advance only to be about 18 
to 20 degrees BTDC. Could this be causing too much heat? Where do I set it 
statically? (TDC or 7.5BTDC) and I'm looking for 28-30 BTDC total advance? 
Right?

Thanks,
Scott
