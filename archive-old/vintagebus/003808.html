&gt; Hello, list.
&gt;
&gt; Let me try this again; I think I sent it to the wrong address...
&gt;
&gt; I have a '65 camper (of some as yet determined variety) and I
&gt; have pureed the threads on the driver's side big nut rear 24 tooth rear
axle
&gt; stub (it still hurts too badly to explain how. Moral: never rush your
work).
&gt; I have 1 and 3/32 inches in diameter of material left on it. Do I dare to
&gt; take it to a machine shop to re-thread it to a smaller nut of some
variety?
&gt; Intuitively, that seems like a bad idea to me, but if it's safe to do,
I'll
&gt; give it a shot.
&gt;
&gt; Otherwise, does anyone have a good 24 tooth big nut stub axle
&gt; lying around they want to unload? I'll take a whole reduction box if you
&gt; don't wanna take it apart.

Funny, I sent you a reply when you 1st posted this request. I never heard
back. Maybe you never received it?

I have a large nut reduction box. It is the right side. So my complete one
won't help. I would hate to sell just the stub axle from it. But.....
What's it worth? + shipping from Fresno, Calif.
