Subject: Re: [VB] Univents??

I haven't seen new ones at any shows or swaps. Bought mine years ago at Pomona 
for a few bucks!  




Make one! I found some closeable round vents in a salvage yard Alfa Romeo and 
cut big holes in an old cover plate. If you don't have a spare plate, they're 
easily fabricated from sheet metal.

&gt; Anyone no if a company is still making those Univents for the Splitwindow Bus?
&gt; I think they're called that.  They replace the cover on the Airbox, where
&gt; Ambulance Fans go, and have directional vents.
