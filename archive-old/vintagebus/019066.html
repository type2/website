These files are again available for download.  However, there's a
rate-limiter of about 3 kilobytes per second in place, because we pay
for peak bandwidth used over time.  When someone tries to pull
everything at once, it does bad things to our bandwidth consumption
statistics.  The rate limiter will keep that from happening, but will
no doubt be somewhat aggravating for those doing downloads.  I'll
happily take money in exchange for removing the limiter....
