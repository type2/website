&lt;&lt; I was wondering what ways people have kept the important information
 for your split in good shape &amp; out of the weather since there is no
 glove box?  &gt;&gt;

the little book goes on the dash or in the drivers door pocket.   I like it 
handy as I write down everything (when I get gas, etc)   You can get really 
cool ones at the drug store these days, tie dye, sparkly, colour coordinate with 
your bus, etc.  

the registration is on the dash tray under the speedo or tucked into the 
fresh air vent lever.  insurancde ditto.   all the other stuff is either in the 
drawer in teh ice box , or in a cabinet in teh back.   There is also a little 
pile of stuff I'm going to install someday around in there.

I really need to clean out the buses.  

Should the camping chairs live in there or not?
