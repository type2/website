&lt;&lt; and a few of those little round rubber bumpers that go
 under the front seat. &gt;&gt;

Hi David,
I think I have a 59 DC i took out drivers seat, no rubber bumpers?
It looks like they were there, &amp; have been removed it appears there were at 
least 4 of them, is that correct? The areas has been filled with
silicone? Were they bolted from under neath, or screwed in from the top?

thanks

terry
