Subject: wiring

well...the time has come.  I have to put a new wiring harness in the 64.

Could someone with experience please tell me some things about the
removal of the old &quot;harness&quot; and the installation of the new harness?
What should I watch out for?  How much of a pain is this to do?  How
much time should I expect it to take?
How do i go about running the harness through to the back of the bus?
There is a tube or something that runs through the frame...correct?

It seems like it shouldn't be that hard...and the harnesses come with
instructions.  I'm thinking about ordering mine either from BusDepot or
Aircooled_dot_net.  Does anyone have experience with harnesses from these
guys?

thanks!
