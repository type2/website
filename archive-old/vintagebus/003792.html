&gt; all replacement German and Mexican gland nuts do have replaceable needle
&gt; bearings, as do the 1500 ones that came off 2 virgin 1966 bus engines that
I
&gt; rebuilt, as for 40 hp or 1300 I do not know.

I stand corrected. It never occurred to me to try to replace just the
bearing, but that certainly doesn't mean you can't. Does anybody stock just
the bearing? Not that I would do it anyway, as you say gland nuts are cheap.
Never have seen one in a catalog or on a shelf, or even listed as NOS-OG on
eBay.
