The seals do not need to be replaced, as long as they aren't ripped or worn.
They stay on the backside of the hub when you remove the spindle nut and
pull off the hub/wheel assembly.  If your bearings have alot of dirt in
them, or the grease is really runny and thin they need to be replaced.  If
you have the new seals, I would replace them anyways. To remove the seals
you should use a long punch that will reach through from the outer side of
the hub through to the inner facing side of the inner (spindle side) wheel
bearing. Using moderate force (not too much) start hammering on the wheel
bearing in a circular pattern (to knock it out evenly) until it pops out of
the hub. An easier way of doing this is to remove the outer wheel bearing
*and washer*, put the hub/wheel back on, install the spindle nut back on
until the nut is threaded on completely (to ensure you don't strip the
theads!), then yank on the whole thing until it pulls the inner bearing and
seal out. Be careful if you use this method to pull _straight_out so you
won't mess anything up, and to make sure that the spindle nut doesn't catch
on the inside of the hub as you pull. Use a rubber mallet to put the new
seal on. Go slow, and in a circular pattern to make sure you don't mess up
the seal. Good Luck.

&gt; please tell me if my 1960 single cab reguires the front wheel seals when I
&gt; change the wheel bearings ? they where sold to me in a kit with the wheel
&gt; bearings . where do they go ? I dont remember taking them off the truck
when
&gt; it was stripped down to the spindle.  nor do I remember installing them on
my
&gt; 58 last winter when the front bearings were redone.
&gt;
&gt; thanks john
