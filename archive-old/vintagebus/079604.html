My question is about the
&gt; strange sound deadening material in the pop-top. They stuck bags and bags of
&gt; the stuff all along the edges of the roof to deaden sound and seal up the air
&gt; leaks. It works just fine, but makes lifting the pop top kinda heavy, (they
&gt; used a LOT of tape).

&gt; Funny thing is I have had a couple of calls from a guy trying to buy the bus,
&gt; and I have not even advertised it yet! The guy offered me $5000.00!

Ummm, perhaps the heavy bags are full of narcotics and the original
owner is trying to get them back?  :)
