Once in awhile, the grammer and the errors make me laugh,
&gt;
&gt; Such as mis-spelling the word &quot;grammar&quot; ??  ;)

Tom,
I guess I should have used the spell check option before I sent that.
I don't mind laughing at myself once in awhile though.
For a short time, I had a security guard job at a Borg-Warner Plant, and
they had a wall in their cafeteria listing all the corporations that they
make parts for and the awards they had received.
Featured prominently on the wall was &quot;VOLKSWAGON&quot;

John
