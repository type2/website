I'm having a chronic leakage problem - does that mean I'm not seated?

Is there something fundamentally different with the Mexian seals available
now?  I've done axle seals many times over my VW life, both mine and others,
and it's only recently that I've had issues.  With the '55 it took 3 tries
on one side to get the seal to not leak. On the 60 I just replaced the seal
for the 4th time yesterday afternoon.
