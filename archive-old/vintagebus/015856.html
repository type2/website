+++although I did see a nice blue 62 DC in the lot
with the correct seat++

Hey Steve
The 62 Blue DC in the parking lot was mine...Thanks
for saying &quot;a nice 62&quot;. The 62 is actually my wife's
daily driver, and I drive a 65 DC normally. We have 7
Split busses in our collection. 
If I can ever help with any questions regarding your
62, let me know.
