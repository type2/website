Subject: Re: How to time at Full advance.
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com


Hi Rex,
You could get a workshop blueprints book and manufacture the little degree 
tool that bolts to the case to show the advance or go out and buy an 
adjustable timing light to be used with your tach.  We got our adjustable 
timing light from Sears for about $60.00.  It has an adjustable knob on the 
rear to set or allow you to search for the timing of the engine.  So if you 
want to see when RPMwise the advance hits 28BTDC you set the knob on the 
timing light for 28 degrees advance and the TDC mark is illuminated in it's 
normal TDC place at the split of the engine case.  Eric&amp;Barb
