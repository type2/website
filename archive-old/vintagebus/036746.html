 &lt;&lt;You know what I'm talking about, that little hump that occurs in the seal 
 at the bend in the door, just at the trailing edge of the front vent window. 
 
 Now most people leave it there, or cut it so that it lies down flat.  But 
 you'll notice og seals lie flat without cutting it.  What's the solution to 
 this?  (besides trying to locate NOS seals).&gt;&gt;
 
 My absolutly positively original seals in the 56 westy are slit right there 
 so it lies flat.
 Ditto:
 My absolutly positively original seals in the 57 standard are slit right 
 there so it lies flat.
 Anyone want to proove me wrong?

I will second the slit concept.  I had the same question, nd looked at an OG 
seal, it not only has the square holes cut in nicely, it was slit there.   
You can now sleep well at night
