&gt; Thanks,
&gt; If you would e-mail your article to me that would be great. I'm just
kinda
&gt; making stuff up as I go. Down here in San Antonio it seems no one's
ever heard
&gt; of a bus let alone knows how to fix one. This is my first so I'm
learning. I
&gt; did find out the size it was through calling a tranny specialist in
Hot VW's.
&gt; Finding the 42mm is proving to be a challenge however. The best was
to order it
&gt; from Snap-on for $42 plus an adapter 'cause it's 3/4&quot; drive for $14.
Ouch. I
&gt; did find a local tool dealer that sells, I guess, generic 3/4&quot; drive
stuff. He
&gt; has a set with 5 or 6 sockets, a ratchet and a couple extensions for
$60.

An in-between alternative, if you can get to a Sears store, is to get
the socket and correct handle from them.  It'll run you about $20 for
the socket and another $15 for the 3/4 slide bar to go with it.

Avoid using adapters!  All they do is break the smaller handle you use
to turn them.  Amortize the $15 for the correct 3/4 drive stuff over a
lifetime of use and the frustration you save will make it worth it.
Besides, think of the look on your friend's faces when they come into
your shop and see those monster tools hanging on the wall!  &quot;Ooh, Zac
must _know_ what he's doing with cool tools like that!&quot;  :)

The 42mm size you need comes out to something between 1-5/8 and
1-11/16.  A 1-21/32 socket would be near perfect, but that's probably
an imaginary animal!  Try the 1-5/8 socket first and exchange it for
the larger size if you have to.
