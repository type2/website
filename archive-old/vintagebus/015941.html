hello all
    my name is mark pilarczyk and i live in tampa fl.  My 67 microbus deluxe 
is now complete and for sale.  The interior is all custom, so i have an 
L-shaped bench in the back with tiger fur seat cushions.  It has a new paint 
job, brakes and way to many new parts to start listing.  I won 1st place at 
the bug jame in dade city fl in the &quot;under construction&quot; catagory because 
the body of my bus is in great shape.  I have all the paper work on it and 
pictures from start to finish.  I have invested 6,500.00 and all im asking 
for is to break even.    thanks for your time.

FOR SALE       6,500.00    67 microbus deluxe

great shape runs like a dream.
