Oh sure,

everybody decides to start a thread about 17mm hex tools the DAY AFTER I go 
out and buy the L-shaped wrench.  I haven't had any trouble getting to the 
plugs on my RGB's, or the tranny.  Oh wait a minute, that's probably because 
I don't have an engine in there yet ;-)!

&quot;Whoa! what happened back here!?!&quot;
Actual quote from a guy looking at the gaping hole in the rear of my bus 
(engine hatch lid is detached).

&quot;That's where the engine goes, Joe.&quot;

&quot;Oh, okay.&quot;
