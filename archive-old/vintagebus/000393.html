&lt;&lt; I checked the archives first,and found nothing conclusive.  what actual 
size
 (i.e.. 185/r14) did stock buses come with?  and second what is the actual 
measurement of the tire (i.e. mm in circumference or whatever)?? &gt;&gt;
Hi Zac,
Well that is definitely trying to compare apples to oranges.  Any radial of 
the correct diameter as the original bias ply will be wider than the bias ply 
just due to the differant construction, measurement methods used.  So if the 
tire diameter is the measurement you most want then they are 6.40-15 (Tubed) 
had a dynamic rolling radius 328mm (12.9&quot;), and 7.00-14 (Tubeless) had a 
rolling dynamic radius 313mm (12.3&quot;).  Of course to get the diameter double 
these measurements.  15&quot; rimmed tires 656mm (25.8&quot;) and 14&quot; rimmed tires 
626mm (24.6&quot;).  Personally we have found brands of vintage 15&quot; tires from our 
buses early 1960s era to have a 27&quot; diameter, and 1964-67 14&quot; tires to have a 
26.5&quot; diameter so even back then tire size could be not only differant from 
brand to brand, but from the stock dynamic measurement.  Eric&amp;Barb
