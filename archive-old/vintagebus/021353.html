&lt;&lt;  I can't remember the proper &quot;steps&quot; for engine break-in. &gt;&gt;

Hi Scott,
VW used for the first oil fill up in new engines at the factory 10WT during 
the cooler weather season and 20WT during the warm weather season.  Then you 
need to run it at about 1,500-2,000RPM for fifteen minutes.  Shut off the 
engine drain the oil and put in 30 WT or other proper wieght oil for your 
season/climate.  Drive in town (Stop-go traffic.) for the first 300 miles 
(500KM) change the oil again unless you have a full flow filter system and 
retorque the lower head studs.
