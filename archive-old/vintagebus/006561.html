Andre...

My single-stage 6.5 HP/60 gal compressor runs constantly with my Devilbiss
DA sander.  That means it ain't big enough!  And the Sears 4.5 HP 5 gal dual
stage unit ($429) was called insufficient and a POS by several people, so I
took it back before use.  I doubt that you could get enough pressure/volume
with the unit you're looking at, but I could be wrong....

&gt; It could of been done by looking at the archives but I'm pressed for time
&gt; here. Help me with this one.
&gt; 4H.P. 11 Gallon oil free compressor for $180.00
&gt;
&gt; a) good price?
&gt; b) enough for basic things? (air-tools and bit of painting?) no
&gt; sandblasting
