&gt; I encourage all of you to never order from bus depot ever. ...
&gt;
&gt;  IF ANY ONE
&gt; FROM BUS DEPOT READS THIS AND WISHES TO MAKE
&gt; A FORMAL APPOLOGY PLEASE  CONTACT ME



It is normal etiquette, when a problem occurs between listmembers or between
a listmember and vendor, to attempt to resolve the problem directly via
p-mail, and to air dirty laundry on the list only if that attempt fails,
rather than the other way around.  Had you sent this email to me instead of
to hundreds of people at once (without even copying me at all, much less
sending it to me first), you would have received not just a &quot;formal
apology,&quot; but also a free-merchandise credit toward your next order by way
of apology. As always, I encourage all customers and list members to contact
me personally at busdepot_at_email_dot_com should they have any problems with any
Bus Depot order.

As I understand it, our vendor (who dropshipped your order) failed to
include the seals in your wheel bearing kit.  When you called and informed
us of this, we sent them out the very same day.  This was certainly our (or
our vendor's) mistake, we apologized for the error at the time, and I will
apologize again.  I do not recall you mentioning &quot;forgotten left side brake
hardware,&quot; but will of course look into it right away.

Pricing is subject to change. Costs fluxuate all the time - both up and
down. We try to update our website pricing on a timely basis (every few
days), but there are occasions when a price may change before the website is
updated (or where there is simply a typo or error on the website).  When
this occurs (and it does not occur very often), we inform you of the new
price prior to processing your order, of course.

Regarding delivery time frame, we do say to allow 7-10 working days for
delivery on all ground orders.  Not that we always take this long, but I
would rather quote a longer timeframe and have people be pleasantly
surprised, than the other way around. I try to be upfront about all of our
delivery terms, policies, etc., and made sure to design the website such
that you have to click through our policies page in order to reach the order
form.  Nevertheless we get our share of people who fail to read the quoted
timeframe and still get upset when their order does not arrive within a day
or two. If your bus is on jackstands and you cannot afford to wait up to 10
working days, overnight, second- or third-day service is available (and
offered both on the website and in the catalog) - but you have to request
it.  Presently we are getting orders out the door pretty quickly.  But a
couple of weeks ago we were indeed hitting that 10 working day maximum as
often as not, because my summer help had gone back to school and
replacements had not yet been hired.  Circumstances like that are exactly
why I specify a 7-10 working day timeframe.  Please do avail yourself of the
expedited shipping options if you cannot risk waiting that long.

I hope this clears up any confusion.
