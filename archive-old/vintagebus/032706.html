Subject: RE: [VB] Intake valve stuck !

take the head off. if it was a new head and all the cosmoline was not
properly cleaned off, this may be a recurring problem. if this is the case,
new new heads not being disassembled and not properly cleaned before using
them, i'd remove both heads, remove all the valves and thoroughly clean
everything to remove all traces of cosmoline. i have seen this happen-the
cosmoline collects in the valvetrain, re-solidifies when it cools, and then
it and causes valves to stick open.
if by new you mean rebuilt, there may be a clearance problem if new
valves/guides have been installed and the guides may need to be reamed  and
maybe different valves fitted.

&gt; #2 Cylinder intake valve stuck open( noticed loss of power) Can I get out
my
&gt; nail puller and a block of wood and pop that baby closed ? Or should I
&gt; remove the head ( stock 1600 DP) and take it to some one to figure out
what
&gt; went wrong? About 1200 miles on the heads they were new ....
