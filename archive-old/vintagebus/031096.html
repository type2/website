Subject: AIRS update

Just a little update on the guys that stopped by here a week or so ago 
from Nebraska.  They and they're 71 bus are in New York today and should 
be to Maine during the day some time.  They're doing well and haven't 
had any more problems, but they say something is rattling in back, 
probably engine tin or something of the like.

Does anyone have a list of shows coming up on the east coast?  Anywhere 
from Maine down to Florida.  I'd like to get these guys a list as they 
were wanting to attend some shows/campouts while on their trip.

Thanks!
