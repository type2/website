Need some tranny I.D. help.  Clara's response to my post indicated I had a split case tranny due to the year of the bus, 1959.  I originally thought this as well, until I noticed the gearshift position on the front cab floor.

The gearshift is located much further back on the floor than the standard gearshift location that I'm used to.  It's approx. 2 ½&quot; to 3&quot; (going on memory from yesterday) from the front seat pedestal.  I was always under the impression that this signified a crashbox tranny.  Is this a correct assumption, or did split case trannies also have that gearshift location.

I have a feeling about to learn something new, again.

TIA.

Robert
