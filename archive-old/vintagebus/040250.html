Hey All,

I'm planing on doing my second engine pull Saturday to replace my chewed up 
12v flywheel and put in a 12v starter and 12 to 6v starter bushing.  A 
fellow listee has offered to hook me up w/ a good used flywheel.  My boss 
(who's an Alpha nut) acts as if its a big balance issue to do this and I 
should opt to just replace the ring gear on my existing flywheel.  Any 
ideas/advice/concerns I should know about?  Not worried about being perfect 
just want dependability.

Thanks,

Eric
