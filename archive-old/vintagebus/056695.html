&gt; Is it possible to replace the bushings in nose of the gearshift 
&gt; housing/noise cone of the tranny housing while its still in the bus?  How 
&gt; bout the seal between the gearshift housing and the rest of the tranny?

Only by cutting off the rear end of your bus just behind the rear torsion bar
