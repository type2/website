Poptop '69 Westy no motor $600
Midtown Phoenix, AZ
Clean/open Arizona title. 
Current AZ plates through Jun 01.

Need a low dough cruiser until you hit the Lotto? Want
something that won't hurt if it gets confiscated but
solid enough to tour with this Summer? Have you
recently lost your job acting on Ally McBeal? This bus
is for you! Driven home over the weekend. Engine
plucked- you get the rest. Good canvas, complete
interior, needs your motor, major cleaning, center pin
and one ball joint &lt;2 balljoints come with bus&gt;. Paint
is appropriate for the price. Stop by the Ace Hardware
and pick out what color you want it to be. =) Floors
and rockers are solid and not rusty. All doors shut
fine. **Excellent** to toss an engine into and cruise
it for a low dough thumper. F-orget that show car
swill. This is the real deal!
(480) 891-5083 Mon-Fri or email. Arizona Bus Club
discount or anyone with Franklins.
