Then I hope you stay away from at least Colin. I have proof that he said he 
had the correct paper work on the van I got from him and earl. I also have 
proof that I told them there was NO paper work on the buggy I traded. I also 
have proof that they owe me and were going to ship out the corners they had 
for the bus.

As you read in the note Colin just wrote to the list asking for my being 
tossed off the list for slander, you will notice he said he told me there 
was no paper work for the van. Dont you just HATE liers? I have spent almost 
a year trying to get the paper work straight. I had asked him in very nice 
letters to him to help me, but he refused to answere any of them for the 
past year.

Now tell me, wouldnt you be VERY upset ?

Sorry for the GROUP thing, but again, I got a run around from someone in the 
same town(I think) as Colin. I have other suspicions too, but those will be 
confirmed later.

I might have to ask that Colin be thrown off the list for lieing.

Again, sorry for that group thing and if you want proof of what I have said, 
just let me know. I have kept everything from me and too Colin, including my 
three months of emails back and forth from the DMV of NC that says he never 
owned such a truck with those VIN numbers.

David
