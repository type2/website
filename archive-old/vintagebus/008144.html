With all the posts I went through to lookup some info on tires I can't seem
to find the answers to my questions.

I just installed Pirellis P300 on my rims and I'm gonna take them with me to
pick up my bus. I probably won't need them there since I'm taking a trailer
but just let me know if these tires sound right. Pirelli P300; 185 70X14.
There is no load factor,  it just says  &quot;Standard Load&quot; and Max Load is at
1201 lbs _at_ 35 PSI. Now if I got my math correct pressure should be at 15 PSI
up front and 22 in the back since the back is heavier. Right? That's at
least how someone knowledgeable told me to figure my pressure.

Later,
