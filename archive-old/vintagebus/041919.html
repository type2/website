&gt; You actually ave to remove the fanshroud and the two vent tins to find the 
&gt; Hoover  L deflector.  It mounts to the cooler with the two nuts that hold the 
&gt; cooler to the adaptor, and has a L that Ls around to the right (windward) 
&gt; side of the cooler.

Oh-Oh!  There's another directional reference to remember.  Lessee, FIF,
never use &quot;driver&quot; or &quot;passenger&quot;, and now &quot;windward&quot;!  What's next,
&quot;leeward&quot;?

At least we're not using &quot;Dorsal&quot; and &quot;Caudal&quot;!  :)

   THere is a place for a screw to screw the front of the 
&gt; doghouse bit of the shroud to the L bit.  Have only ever found that screw 
&gt; done once.   

It's done on both of my aircoolers.  I think that many Hoover bits get
trashed because people remove the fan shoud (or try to) without removeing
the screw that attaches the bit to the shroud.

I use a hex-head screw on this location, as it is easier to get a box end
wrench on it than a stubby screwdriver.
