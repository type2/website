Andrew,

I didn't say there is any rivalry.  On the contrary, people just got fed up
with paying money to a club (really only one guy) and receiving almost nothing
in return.  No news letters on a consistent basis, regular events, etc.  So as
a result, people in Southern California and mostly in Orange county decided to
try and recapture the sprit of what SOTO used to be like in the mid 80's.
While the existence of OCTO has seemed to light a fire under the collective
SOTO behind, I think its too little too late.

There will be two events on the same day...June 12.  OCTO will be in Orange
County, and I believe SOTO will be held down in Escondido at the Deer Park
Winery.  Everyone needs to make up his or her mind to what show they will
attend.  As for me I choose OCTO.

&gt; Hey Steve,
&gt; Thank you and eveyone else, for that matter for shedding some light on the
&gt; whole soto/octo situation.I have owned newer buses up until the last year or
&gt; so and wasn't in on the whole &quot;vintage bus club&quot; scene.
&gt; I didn't realize that there was such a rivalry.
&gt; As someone said,VW trends does seem to paint a pretty picture of soto
&gt; whenever they feature a story about them.
&gt;
&gt; Just to let everyone know, Hot VW's June issue has a 2 page spread about
&gt; octo's winter meet and they go on to talk about the show at &quot;the pond&quot; on
&gt; Sat.June.12th.
&gt; Just because I'm driving down all the way from Vancouver, I think I'll check
&gt; out all three shows that weekend...after all I still have a passion for VW's
&gt; not matter what club is sponsoring an event!
&gt; See you in June!
&gt; Andy
