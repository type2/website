Subject: Re: [VB] Re: some questions

Guys,

Regarding this alleged 'transistor' that came with this man's 67 radio:

I have the original 67 Motorola radio in my bus. There was no extra
transistor in a box. Looking at the schematic, there is an output
transistor in the circuit just after the first audio stage, which is an
early Motorola IC. The speaker is wired to two wires coming from the
radio.

The extra piece is, as Matt as said, prolly a dropping resistor, or some
other strange thingee. Check your radio to see if it's a 6 Volt model, in
which case, the extra piece is prolly a dropping resistor.

good luck,

cal
