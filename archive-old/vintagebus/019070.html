RE: no steering dampeners on Barndoors. Um, are you
sure that you are sure or just basing knowledge on
post 2/55 buses? 
Checking my Workshop Manual Edition 1954 Section V
Front Axle and Steering, Page 10-5 describes
&lt;quote&gt;Steering Dampener Removal and Installation &lt;end
quote&gt;. I could have *sworn* that there was indeed a
dampener on the '54 Barnambulator. And no, the front
end was not a later type as it was impossible to use
any of the popular &quot;Bus&quot; tow bars. Tubes were too fat.
Manual makes notes of washer usage for From Chassis No
166 278 ~blahblah and later mentions Chassis No 20-117
902- 166 277. I havent bothered to check dates on
those chassis so please fill me in as the thread goes
on...
To CYA: the margin of this manual indicates 7-57 TV55e
1NI57 Printed in Germany. One could easily surmise
that this &quot;1954&quot; edition was printed/reprinted in 1957

Ultimately, it is no effect on my current stable of
barndoors.

Right, no dampners on Barndoors, mine seems to drive
fine, no grabbing or anything, maybe I never noticed.

There's a guy in Phoenix with what he says is a
Barndoor steering dampner,he's had it at shows for
years, I always forget my parts book to check it
out because it doesn't look like the one I've seen
pictured somewhere as a retrofit.  It was even at a
show that Clara was at, she missed it, uh-oh.:)
