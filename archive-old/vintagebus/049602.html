Subject: trip preparations

I have been bustin' keister to prep the 70 bus for our trip to Palo Duro
next month - in between working on a KG and a truck!
So busy at work this last year the poor beast has really gotten shabby -
mechanically and rust-wise :P

Here's the laundry list so far; feel free to add things I've missed!

Replaced the passenger tires with Bridgestone 603Ds... so far, I like them.
We'll see how they handle on dirt roads.
 Extra ground clearance, and lower rpms; was getting 3800 at 60 and 10%
too-low odometer readings. Read 3300 at 60 now. Haven't had a chance to
test the accuracy of MPH/odometer readings  yet. Web chart says these
should be 0.5% too fast.

Tightened the front end; had an annoying rattle when going over bumps -
found that all the shock nuts were loose, one was missing a spacer, and
that the ball joint nuts were loose as well. No more rattlerattlethunk.

Noticed that I had been hitting the stop inside the steering box when
making tight turns; this is NOT a good thing, you can break the innards!
You want the swing lever to contact the stops welded to the axle tube
instead. Looked at the pittman arm, and it was lined up w/ the index mark
on the spindle, so the trouble was in the drag arm; I rotated the end one
spin towards the rear and reassembled the linkage. Now the steering wheel
alignment was off! Took it off, straightened the wheels, and replaced the
steering whell in the correct position. While there, I filled in the chips
on the steering wheel and painted them black. Looks nice, is centered, and
I drove 1 mile down a road today with my hands OFF the wheel!!  Straight as
an arrow.

Replaced the front rotors (I have 72 disks and drums) - they really didn't
need it, but were slightly warped and drove me nuts coz they pulsed the
brake pedal and occ. made noise. Plus, G&amp;H Imports got me a good deal on
some German rotors - $25_at_!

Rebuilt the rear cylinders... they cylinders themselves were pitted
internally from rust, but only leaked on one shoe; I have since purchased
new cylinders, but don't know whether I'll put em in now or leave things be
until the rebuilds start to leak again and replace then. Same w/ the new
hoses; old ones are 3 years old.
 Redid the emergency brakes; the cables had been rubbing on the hubs,
making a horrible scraping noise (that was also transmitted UP the cables
in to the cab!) and wearing through the eye at the end of the cable. I went
to the junkyard and found a new arm and spreader bar (a 72-only part, right
there in a drawer, WOOHOO!!)and put em in; adjusted the ebrake. Both sides
needed some steel spacers under the adjuster nuts to take up slack, as they
are the original 70 cables (a few MM longer than  72, apparently - or
stretched!). Can now pull the ebrake 10 clicks and not move either wheel.

Glycerined all the rubber; I will likely put some sealer in between the
glass and rubber up top, as water seeps in from the top of the seals.
Bottom is fine, oddly.

I am working on putting in a bed from a mid-70s Westy for the trip... it
was already dinged up, so I didn't mind cutting parts to fit - mainly
around the heaters. I need to drill some holes to mount hold-down bolts,
but will wait for the tank to be removed (see next).

 Took my spare tank and cleaned, derusted and POR-15 Tank Treatment-ed
it... Should be rust-free for years! Coating is a nice silver rubberlike
stuff that worked really well. Poisonous as hell tho - isocyanates!  I
suspect a leak in the current tank, as the rearend always stinks lately. If
nothing else, the vent hoses needed replacing.  I plan on swapping tanks,
drilling seat mounting and cargo tiedown holes, and maybe welding up some
rot in the wheel well next weekend... also, I might try and put a reserve
tap in there.

Tigtened all CV joint bolts. One is stripped, but seems to stay in. I'll
have to watch it. I have new, TIGHT joints, and these bolts are constantly
working loose - I imagine from the extra torque required to turn the tight
joints? They never come out, but do allow some grease to fling (which is
how I know when to tighten them again :P)

I am going to put some POR15 FireSeal putty into the exhaust clamp areas to
see if this will finally take care of those ANNOYING 'moustache bar' leaks;
while I might need to chisel it out to replace the muffler, I'll take the
risk!

The motor seems fine - I'll change the oil and tune it before we go. I am
not sure what to do about my dizzy and carb, tho; the dizzy is a 009,, and
while it kinda sucks in town (doggy), it runs great flat out. Ditto for the
carb: a 30/31 that stinks up the place with gas at idle, but makes the bus
fly down the highway. I have been at 75 with pedal room and temps to spare
for hours at a time (the old tires made the engine run at 4000 rpm, tho.
actual speed was likely 65).
My beloved 30pict1 has too great a cross-shaft leak to use until Rimco
returns it from rebushing.

I am wondering if maybe I should stop tinkering with things while I'm
ahead... you know, just button it up and GO!!

Any other tweaking ideas are welcome, tho.
