Subject: Re: [VB] rear heat vs front heat

If you crawl under the bus you'll see there is a Y sticking out from the tube 
that leads to the front... one arm goes to a heater box, the other is capped 
off.   So remove the cap, and rout the air from the other heater box to the Y 
... while is what is done in the commercials.

my 61 deluxe w/ Z bed has the heat 1/2 to front and half to back... which 
keeps it more evenly warm.. plus when camping the bed is pre warmed... which 
kicks ass.    I had to cut the wooden bottom of the Z bed to install it to fit 
around the heat log there, and I removed the door to under the bed so the heat 
can escape.

You also might want to check all the heat system connections to make sure the 
heat is all getting up front.  Duct tape can help at the heater box to tube 
connections.    And I added bubble wrap insulation on the long heat tube under 
the bus, which really helped make the heat out of the front warmer.   (seam 
down so it can drain, used wire zip ties, pic on thesamba gallery I think)

Well -
        Its still cold here and i have been pondering a heat issue in my bus. 
 It is a 64 standard with the heat tube in the passenger compartement.  
        Well, the rear heat tube is covered by a z bed ( which does have 
holes cut for ventilation by previous owner ).

My question is:  has anybody come up with a way to direct all that heat to 
the front.  In other words, my heat to the front is kinda bad because its only 
coming from one heater box is there a way to hook up both to go to the front?

thanks
