Subject: FS - 55? USA camper conversion parts bus - Maine
Message-ID: &lt;0.9f4a3718.253de00e_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

I am not sure it is cosher to post info about other's ebay auctions, but I 
thought this warranted a heads up to people looking for US conversion camper 
parts.

Ebay item 183906499

Seller has a ratty 55? bus which I think is a USA camper conversion of a 
panel.  I am not sure which USA conversion company we are talking about, as 
that is not my game.  So you conversion camper folks can ID: it has the 
awning windows (hinged at the top, open out) with glass radiused at the 
corners about an inch and a vertical mutton/mullion at the center of the 
glass.  

The starting bid is $500 which seems a bit steep, especially given there are 
no pictures of the camper interior.  Anyway, who am I to say, the price is 
what someone will pay for it, and I don't need it.  

Sorry, although I am kind of next door (two of thoes tiny old states) in 
Vermont, I am not in a postion to field trip it.  Maybe someone else on the 
list near Belfast Maine?  Seller mentions that they will take it apart and 
ship.
