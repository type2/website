Volks,

One of my sons claims you can't swap out a bug and bus tranny because
of the RGB's, the bus will have 4 reverse gears and 1 forward gear if
you put a bug tranny in it, and visa-versa.

Is this true?  I thought the RGB's had enough gears in them that the
tranny turned the same way as a bugs?

Yeah, I know . . . stupid.

Curt
