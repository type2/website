I just went thru the same thing with my deluxe (66).
I first worked all the old rubber out, it takes for ever but you can do it.
Then I wire and fiber brushed it (go the fiber deal for my drill at Home
Depot).
Hit them with rust inhibitor then, and this is what makes it work, brushed on
epoxy primer. From there I filled the holes and pits with Metal filled body
filled primed and shot them. They look like new
