Subject: Re: [VB] Bus Shades - Need replacement fabric - BYOB caravan from  Central CA

Damn!  I didn't know that!  I spent almost $200 on a new set of covers!
I'd bought an extra end piece to use to make a door.

It's all a moot point now, as I'll be dismembering the costco shelter once I 
break ground on my new garage:

&gt;   This might help the Costco cover owners. Costco warrents the cover for 3
&gt; years. You can take the whole thing back and they will replace it free (ya
&gt; right, like I want to take it down) or you can go to there web site and the
&gt; manufacturers phone number is there. All I did was call them up, fax them a
&gt; copy of my reciept and had a new top and sides in 3 days!! Great customer
&gt; service
