Subject: Re: [VB] And now a handbrake cable question...

Hi Lee,
Open up your phone book and look in the yellow pages for &quot;Wire Rope&quot; or 
&quot;Industrial Supply&quot;.  Call them and see if they can swedge on a new front cable end 
onto 1/4&quot; cable.  If yes, then take your 1964-67 handbrake cables and either 
one of the early handbrake cable or the measurement from one.  They may not 
have the proper end in stock and so might have to order some.  The only problem 
we have with ours done this way is the cable end was longer and needed to be 
bent very slightly to be able to pass through the curve of the tubes in the 
bus.  Otherwise they have worked great!!
  BTW You might want to have four of those cables done.  That way you can 
have spares on the shelf!
