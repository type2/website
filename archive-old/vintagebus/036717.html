hi list,

My quota of luck for this year must be on the verge of running out. In the
last six months I have been given a bunch of bus related stuff, including a
near perfect set of safaris, a parts book with updates to the late
seventies, three different bus manuals and been sold my recent '57 kombi
aquisition with a crate of parts for the equivalent of a coupla hundred
dollars.

It gets better, this morning I collected a beetle driving colleague from a
saintly guy who does classic car(mainly British cars from the sixties). He
recently did an incredible job of rehanging the doors on my '60 double cab
and we spoke quite a bit.

I told him about the '57 which has had a very practical but awful looking
camper interior fitted. I wailed about the difficulty involved in finding
seats and interior bits.

This morning as I drive into his yard I see a complete 13 window brazilian
split screen. When I ask him about it he says he bought it for the gearbox
which he needs to fit to a clients bus! This excellent old bloke says that
as long as I don't take too long about it I can have any/all of the parts
that I want.

I'm stoked off my head cos the interior is complete down to the dome lights.
It shouldn't take me more that a day to strip everything I want. I will also
take the front beam and big nut redux boxes. I would take the whole bus but
I just don't have tha space.

YIPPPPPPEEEEEEE! 

Michael
