Subject: Re: [VB] re:6v to 12v converter

Kevin -
The 52 watts x 4 is speaker output and I have never seen a radio with more
than a 3 amp fuse in it so it should just be fine. I was given a Radio Shack
one a few months ago that I was going to use in my 62 but went for 12 volts
for now(could that be cause I had a brand new 12 volt battery sitting
around?....yeah). So hook it up and get some tunes.
