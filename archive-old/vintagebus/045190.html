&lt;&lt; Howdy,
Need a new Dual vacuum unit the one with the dual acting advance/retard 
device any ideas? Local dealer still has them but if $138 bucks is the only 
option I'll just drop in another distributor, I have a used one or two but 
been that route the last used one only lasted a few months, anybody 
rebuilding distributors.   Ty  &gt;&gt;
Hi Ty,
If they had too much side to side and/or end play you probably needed to 
rebuild them or in the case of vacuum distributors if the leaks down you need 
a new vacuum diaphram.  We have heard that there is a rebuild kit for 009s 
that has the same bushings in them for almost all VW Bosch distributors.  We 
have not tried to get any of these so far.  Maybe someone on the list has?
