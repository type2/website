&lt;&lt;  While searching the archives I came across some information about 
emergency brake cable problems with the big nut trans. in an early bus. What 
is the problem and does anybody have a good solution- I need to buy cables 
for my bus. Thanks. &gt;&gt;

Hi Mario,
You need to shorten the E-brake cables to work in pre-1961 buses.  We used 
pairs of cable clamps from a local hardware store on each cable to do this by 
looping the cables once under the front floor in our 1960 walk thru panel 
camper conversion.  Eric&amp;Barb
