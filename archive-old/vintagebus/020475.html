&gt; Well, I loaded the family into the bus and headed up
&gt; to the top of the
&gt; hill (&quot;mountain&quot; to those E. of the Mississippi)
&gt; behind my house.  It's
&gt; about a mile or so to where the street goes into the
&gt; next valley.  We
&gt; walked another quarter mile to the top and waited
&gt; for darkness.  
&gt; 
&gt; After darkness fell, we were treated to four
&gt; professional fireworks
&gt; displays (Stevenson Ranch, Valencia Town Center,
&gt; Castaic Lake, and Magic
&gt; Mountain) and an entire city's worth of illegal
&gt; munitions, all from the
&gt; same vantage point.  
&gt; 
&gt; After the display was over, we loaded back into the
&gt; bus and drove back
&gt; home.  Remarkably, nothing fell off or broke during
&gt; the grueling 2-mile
&gt; drive.  Temperatures were in the high 80's but this
&gt; was quite comfy
&gt; compared to midday temps.
&gt; 
&gt; Happy Independence Day (or whatever you're
&gt; celebrating today!)

 Well...Well....what a small world....You are talking
about the town I grew up in from (1963) 10 years old
till I was 17 (1970 in Acton by that time)...Some of
the names are faded from this old mans 48 year old
brain but we called it Skyblue.The hill overlooking
Canyon High School is where we lived.If you ever want
to dig thru that schools basement? You might find some
of my old football and track awards 1969 first year of
the School.Mark Williamson is the name...My brother
Bill played baseball...What a small world!!!  Mark and
