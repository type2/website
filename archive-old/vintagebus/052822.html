Subject: Re: [VB] another example of why you should DIY (long)

Yikes.  You're lucky you smelled that fire...you may well have toasted
that engine otherwise!  Without airflow, even if it IS 40 below, it doesnt
take long to toast those heads!.....


My wife drove a beetle home a good 8-10 miles after it broke a belt. WOW
that was a hot buggy!! SMOKIN. Still ran fine though. Go figure.
