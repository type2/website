Subject: Re: [VB] Valve cover gasket sealer?

I use Hylomar or Curil. Which ever I have the most of at the time. I 
also coat both sides of the gasket. My synthetic oil never leaks from 
the covers.

What does everyone use on the valve cover side of the gasket. anything 
at all?
I was putting my covers back so I can go back in, and was wondering if 
anyone used anything.  It didn't leak before, never been on the road 
yet, at least from the valve covers.
