&gt;My question is to those with experience using time-serts to repair 
&gt;stripped threads.  Did you do the repair with the part in place (using
&gt;an electric hand drill) or remove the part and drill it out in a drill
&gt;press?

I helped my Dad when he stripped out one of the oil drain plate studs
on his Bug.  For that he did the drilling with a hand drill and the 
engine installed.  He found that the alloy material tends to &quot;grab&quot; the
drill bit, and that the bit goes quickly through the alloy.  Nothing
bad happened but it's a lot different than drilling steel.

I would suggest using a brand new (or very sharp) bit and very light
pressure.  Make sure you are holding the drill perpendicular to the
head when you start as it's hard to correct if you start crooked.
If you have a variable speed drill, start out at a fairly low speed.

Good luck!
