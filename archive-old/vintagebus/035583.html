 So... Planning to do a valve job due to low compression in cylinder #3, so I
 finally pulled everything apart today.  BTW, this is a 1500, pretty much 
stock
 engine.
 
 All the valves look about the same to me, should I be able to tell which one
 was sticking?  Also the idiot book says to push on them (valves), but the big
 springs holding them are too hard for that, am I supposed to take the springs
 off and if so, how?
 
--------------------------------
take them to a good machine shop experienced in vws, and have them done.

....................................
 Looking at the pistons, they all have quite a bit of carbon on them, with #3
 having the most, almost covering the whole thing.  I also notice that #3 has
 a small chip out of the edge of it, about 1 mm thick and 5mm long, 
corresponding
 to a bump on the edge of the cylinder.  Should I worry about this?  I havent
 pulled off the cylinders yet, am not sure whether to take the heads to a 
machine
 shop today or???
 
 This is all being done in anticipation of a trip to New Orleans in April so
 I want it to be done properly.  If I replace the chipped piston &amp; cylinder,
 do I replace all of them???
 &gt;&gt;

take all the cylinders and pistons off, marking which is which.  Heating up 
the cylinder with a propane torch after removing the circlips (use circlip 
pliers or needlenose pliers) will help the pin slide out easily.  check for 
grooves in the cylinders.   Check fit of a used ring in a piston- Muir says 
how.   what is the gap in the ring in there?   how bad or good is it.

you should also pull of the rods  (mark them too- I use a hammer and punch- 
knock 1 dot for #1, two dots for #2, etc.  ) and look at the rod bearings.  
rod bearings are only about $10 a set (us) you should replace them at this 
time, the size is marked on the old bearings (they are like half rings) - you 
must get the right size.

how to decide whether just to replace rings and rod bearings, or more- well- 
are there grooves in the cylinders?   is there a noticable ridge from the 
swept area to the unswept area? The unswept area will have the hatch marks 
still- are there some left in the rest of the cylinder?  the chip may not bee 
a problem. You can re-use ps and cs, or just replace one, if same 
size/weight, but you may want to get a new set, which will also some with new 
rings, wrist pins, and circlips.



also- how is your endplay- with the FW still on and bolt tight, push pull the 
crank pully- it should only move a hair.   if it thunks you may want to 
rebuild the bottom end, but then you may be able to get away with resetting 
the endplay.   You should replace the main seal at this time too.  do you 
know how many miles the motor has?   How dirty/stained are the heads from the 
side the rockers go on?   Did any studs pull out when you took the head nuts 
off?
