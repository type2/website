Dig that title, eh? :-)

Tonight I read the Bentley and how it suggested that when you pull your
speedo cable you should hook a wire to it to 'facilitate installation' of
the cable.

I was able to pull it and yoink the parcel tray out.  I scrubbed it real
good but there is dried adhesive smeared all over it because it was at one
time upholstored with that Aero Boleric (sp?) interior - kind of a tan
color.  The adhesive covers the back part where the screws go and then on
down where you would set stuff.  The adhesive stops just shy of the lip that
keeps things from rolling off of the edge.

My question is:  Is it right that the factory upholstored darn near the
whole shelf?  Should I glue some appropriately colored vinyl down or just
get the whole shelf blasted and painted?  I do like the look of a plain
clean parcel shelf but I also need to watch the money as I racked up a ton
of funds on the VISA on the rear-end rebuild alone.  If I can, I'd like to
make the parcel tray look nice and do it on a budget.

Thanks for the ideas and advice...
