&lt;&lt; I have a '65 Sundial that I've been thinking of putting a T4 in.  I'd like 
a bit more speed.   I've also thought about putting the 3.88 R&amp;P in it 
instead, but that sounds like a lot of work, as there are no shops in my area 
(Indiana) that do this sort of thing, and I've heard horror stories about 
messing with VW trannies.&gt;&gt;
Hi Josh,
It depends on what you mean more speed.  The type 4 will definitely get you 
quicker acceleration and faster hill climbing, but really will not get you 
much more higher MPH for cruising without loss of reliability and bad MPG.  
In other words installing it on a stocker or worse geared tranny with a top 
speed in fourth anywhere from 30 to 55 MPH at 3,000 RPM is like putting 
Arnold Schwarzenegger in his youngest and fittest day on a childs tricycle 
built big enough for him to ride and expecting him to even be able to keep up 
in a long distance professional bicycle race where the other contestants 
riding 10 or 12 speed bikes.  So if you are looking for a higher top speed 
best to check your RPMs your tranny gives you now and look into either a 
3.875 or 3.44 R&amp;P freeway flier tranny.  Rancho from what we have heard is a 
good tranny shop to have the center section done by and you can and should do 
the RGBs yourself.  If you think you still might go with the type 4 engine 
after installing the freeway flier tranny make sure to have Rancho beef the 
tranny up to hold up to the higher HP and torque.  Rebuilding and converting 
the type 4 engine is alot of work and money also!  Figure at least $1,500 for 
just the longblock and you can easily spend again the same amount to convert 
it or spend lots of your time fabricating parts to make it an upright engine 
to fit in a pre-1972 bus.
  Also check the archives for more tranny info and we would be happy to Pmail 
you info we have on the 3.875 freeway flier.  Eric&amp;Barb
