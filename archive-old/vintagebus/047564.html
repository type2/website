What I have done in the past to weed out the talkers and the tire kickers is 
if someone wants to buy a vehicle or part long distance is have them mail the 
deposit, or total sales price, or whatever the agreement is *that day* or the 
next morning at the latest.  I then agree to hold the part or vehicle for 3 
days while waiting for the payment to arrive.  If the payment doesn't arrive, 
whatever it is I'm holding goes back up for sale.  If they are not serious 
enough to mail the payment I won't hold it on the chance they might follow 
through someday.  

Also on delayed pick up, I think we all understand things come up and that's 
fine.  But if you are supposed to pick it up in X weeks and it looks like it 
will be X+4 weeks.  Send some more money.  No much satisfies a restless 
seller like cash in hand.  Great way to ensure your item will be there when 
you are ready to go get it.

&lt;&lt; I had a similar dilemma when I was selling my '56.  The potential buyer,
 with whom I'd spoken to at length on the phone, made a commitment to buy
 it on a certain date.  Fine.  He called/emailed twice to slip the date, and
 I cut him some slack.  ..... OTOH, there's a lotta tire kickers out there.  
People who make committments to cars/parts/etc and drag their heels scouting 
for a better deal.  The general rule of thumb should be, if you want it, 
cough up the cash ASAP so  there's no issues.  &gt;&gt;
