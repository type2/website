Actually, those numbers are pretty accurate as I recall.  The engine was a
Ford V-8.  Would have been a 21-stud mill at that early date.

Automobile Quarterly did one of their typically excellent stories on the
Dymaxion fairly early in their [AQ's] publication.  I have a copy here
somewhere, but can't get up the stairs to check cuz I'm nursing a fractured
hip.

&gt;&gt;  I'd take those numbers with a big grain of salt!  I doubt that they were
ever tested, and inflating the positives was very common in that era.  &lt;&lt;
