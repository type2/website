First, the only address you need for VW distributor information:

http://www.oldvolkshome_dot_com/ovhignbo.htm

The below notes are from that page; see the page for *lots* more info.

&gt;
&gt;one is a 010 bosch.

This could be at least a couple of distributors, depending on the
rest of the number: 0 231 137 010 (later Beetle), 0 231 129 010
(early Beetle), or 0 231 173 010 (loaf Bus).

&gt;the other is a BOSCH ZV/PAU 4R5 CAN ANYONE GIVE ME SOME INFO ON THIS DIST.

Probably an early 60s Bug and Bus part, VW 113 905 205A .

&gt;
&gt;So my distributor number is both of the following
&gt;0231 170 034 and 043 905 205

First one is Bosch number, second one is VW.  It appears to be from
a '74 Beetle.

&gt;It seems kinda wierd actually, because when use the idiot book and 
&gt;try and set it to the grove, or notch in the edge it seems to point
&gt;in the wrong way.

It's been a while since I messed with my Dad's '74 Bug, but it seems
like the rotor in it did point a different direction than the earler
VWs I have worked on.  On the earlier ones (up through late 60s or
so) it seems like #1 and the notch are towards the back and right
of the car - the rotor will be pointing at you as you stand behind
the center rear of the car.  On the '74, if I remember right, #1 and
the notch were towards the front and right of the car...the rotor was
actually &quot;pointing&quot; at #1 cylinder (right front of the engine).

Again, check the excellent page at http://www.oldvolkshome_dot_com/ovhignbo.htm
for way lots more information (including points/condenser/cap/rotor
parts numbers).  Even advance-curve information for some distributors.
