the sheet metal has left england as i type this message
it will arrive in pheonix by friday and i will pick-up this weekend
it's nice that air freight can be picked up almost any time
for those of you that have ordered and those that might be needing
some please p-mail me as i will be shipping out next week
the second order is in the works , so if there is something you
need that i'm out of please let me know so that i add it to the next
shippment! if you have das bullis catalogue this is from the same supplier
mine will be up soon (catalogue)



for sound proofing and insulation i have used spray on truck bed liner
this stuff is awesome, it comes in 2 parts and just sprays on like paint
it builds up nice and drys semi hard, it doesn't chip or peel.
as far as rust, it has a rust inhibitor in it to stop and prevent rust
not cheap though a kit that makes 6 quarts cost about 175.00 dollars
and is enough to do an 8 foot pick-up bed, i did the whole underside
of a 21 window deluxe with 1 kit and you could hear the sound difference
most auto paint stores have this product as do most major flaps

12 volt am/fm radios for splits back in stock
clear split windscreens in stock (will have tinted again soon)
wiring works wiring harnesses for splits in stock (less $ then rmmw)
