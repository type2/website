&lt;&lt; HI All,
 
 Hey Baby, don't ever change that bus. And YEAH, Frank Zappa shoulda
 been president. Too bad he passed away before that dream could come
 true. He would have been waayy better than Clinton. &gt;&gt;

I agree JP. You should never modify that bus or update, just give it a paint 
job in stock colors. Nice bus other than the decorations.

 Mike
