Subject: RE: [VB] Time to start replacing glass seals - pop out windows

Wow; this has turned into a very interesting thread!!!

While we are into glass and seals , I have yet another one for the group.  I
am going to do the popout windows in the next month or so(I want to try and
get it all done during the dry season here in Florida).  The outer metal
frame looks pretty crusty and I suspect that after I pull the glass out and
clean them up, there will be nothng left in at least a couple of spots.

I have been looking around the internet and in the WCM catalog.  Although I
see a source for the seals, etc I have yet to find anything for the actual
outside metal pieces.  Are they available out there somewhere??  Has
somebody out there fabricated their own (I am always up for a McGuiver)??

Thanks in advance!!
Rich
