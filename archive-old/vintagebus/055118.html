Subject: RE: [VB] Type IV pricing

Bart writ:
&gt;Just wondering what the pricing of a stock 2.0 liter type4 engine is going
for out there in busland. This would be w/o Webers. I am in the process of
doing this and was curios. 

It depends...  I have seen blown ones for free and used running ones about
$500. 

...  If you want a complete rebuilt long block expect $2-3K.  If you want
custom probably up to $4-5K.

The problem is that Type4 parts are on the pricey side.  Heads being the
worst part, like $500-$700 a pair for 2.0L ones.  Then add in new cam and
lifters for about $200-300 depending on application.

Check Jake's site for some sweet custom stuff...  He is the best Type4 guy I
have seen.

Granted the Type4 is a very nice and robust engine which will last far
longer than a type1 engine in a bus.
