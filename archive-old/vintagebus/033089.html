Subject: bondo?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

while probing my bus today i was starting to strip my paint where there were 
holes. of course bond bondo everywhere. then i started up in my roof. the 
roof looks almost like somebody took a razor and slashed it up. so i stripped 
it there too and it looks like the entire roof is bondo! my kombi was 
converted into a camper some time ago and i was wondering if a substance was 
put on the roofs for some kind of insulation. the reason im asking is because 
the bondo (about three inches thick) on the rockers (from door to wheel well 
almost pure bondo!) was a rock hard grey looking substance. my roof however 
had a blue layer over a green layer and both of these were kind of 
rubbery.....easy to bend and flex and a little bit more dense feeling for a 
insulator of sorts. have any of you ever heard about this being used on 
anycar new or old? do they put somthing on top of the westys? this would 
really help me out if not start looking for a clip or parts bus...
