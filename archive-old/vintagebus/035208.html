Dan Morris ponders........

&lt;&lt; Okay, my tranny is in the shop getting a ring 
and pinion upgrade, etc. and I  wondered if it would 
be a good idea to get the bellhousing enlarged to 
allow a 12 volt flywheel.&gt;&gt;&gt;

Have you discussed this with the shop that is doing
the trans work for you??  I would think that if they
are compentent enough to do that type of work then
they could easily answer that question.   I do it all
the time here.  Take a look at a factory 12 volt case
and compare it to the 6 volt case.  All VW did was to
clearance the area required.  

 &lt;&lt; I intend to install a 1776cc engine with dual kadrons.  
It  currently has a lightened Scat flywheel attached but 
I have been told that  these are not great for daily drivers.&gt;&gt;

The Kadrons are a nice carb once correctly set up.  As
far as daily or mild performance goes in my book these
are the carbs to use.  Good compromise ($$$) between
dual Webber/Dells and the stock set up.  Fairly easy
to find jets for, as compared to the Webs/Dells, just check
your local Suzi/Yamaha motorcycle dealer.  Am not sure
which one ran Solex carbs instead of Mikunis but the jets
for the Solexs are the same.  

I personally wouldn't recommend using a lightened 
flywheel for daily driving.  Use a full weight balanced
unit and you'll be glad you did.  Makes it easier to stop
and smooths out drivetrain vibrations.  

&lt;&lt;   I want to run 12 volts in the bus so  should I use 
the 6 volt starter with 12 volt solenoid or just swap it up 
to a  straight 12 volt setup? &gt;&gt;

Run a 12 volt flywheel with a 12 volt starter.  Since you 
will be converting over a 6 volt case I'd go ahead and run
an automatic trans starter.  These do not require the 
bushing in the bellhousing, match the flywheel teeth, and
if memory serves, provide more torque to start the engine. 

&lt;&lt; The van in question is an early 64.  &gt;&gt;

I'm going to guess and say that you'll run the 3.875
ring and pinion with a late Bus .82 4th gear set??  If so
you'll be glad you did.  Big time difference at highway
speeds with both noise and engine rpm.  I have and am
building several of this style gearbox for the early split
window busses and my customers are very happy with
the results.
