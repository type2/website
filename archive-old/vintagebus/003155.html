Subject: Westy Price Opinions??

Here we go again.  Just want some opinions (again) on a 66 Westy I looked at
last week.  It's a 66 Pop-Top Walk Thru, 6 Volt with 1500 motor (didn't hear
it run bad battery).  Has all the Camper interior minus a door under the
bed.  Has jumpseat, Icebox and Spice Rack. It needs a right rocker, short
panel behind cargo doors and right rear lower panel where battery has leaked
and corroded the metal.  Also will need a battery tray.  The seal looks good
for the top, but the canvas is gone.  Body had some other surface rust that
can be sanded and primed, then you'll never know it was ever there.  The guy
wants $1700 for it, down from $1995.  Sound fair for an Eastcoast Bus?  One
of these days I'm going to find a Bus I really like.  My 66 Kombi's nose was
much worse then I thought.

Dave
