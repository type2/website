Does anybody have a truck rear bumper in california that they want to sell? 
I need a slash cut for my '63 crew. I do not need one in perfect shape, just 
one that is salvageable. I do not &quot;need&quot; the splash pans or overriders, but 
it would be a bonus. I can give you my current bumper as a partial trade 
(66-72? bus blade)
