Ah hah, that's what that connection is for, I was wondering if something 
should go there.  I took off all the paint behind the regulator and that did 
not help. So, I followed your advice for testing the generator and, you were 
right!  Make those rebuildin' bastards run the thing in front of you before 
you take it home... Turns out that the field coil was fried... that's why it 
sounded more like a van de graff generator than a motor when I tried to 
polarize it.  So, they rebuilt another one they had laying around the shop 
for me and it seems to work great.  And yes, I got to pull and reinstall the 
engine I originally installed on Sunday, OH IT'S SUCH A JOY!! The guy at the 
alternator shop told me that VW's were &quot;Hitler's revenge&quot; after I explained 
to him very nicely just how much work it was to replace that defective 
generator.

Next question: So, this engine has about 45 min of operation and 10 miles of 
driving, after I reinstalled it tonight, it seemed to be smoking a little 
when I was making sure the new generator was working (about 5 min of 
observation), hadn't noticed any smoke before. Not thick smoke, but light 
grey smoke, less dense than a cigarette exhale and certainly less dense than 
a bong hit.  Is this normal for a new Mexican longblock that's been run less 
than an hour... I'm just paranoid about this new engine, you understand...


thanks,

Brian
