Subject: Re: [VB] Re: advise needed

All I have is an old phone cord, could I use that instead of speaker wire?  How
do you feel about scotch tape?  and My final question is did you ever give
advice to a gentleman in Texas that used to own a 1967 delux?  Or to an idiot
in the Neatherlands with a camper trailer, because I think I figured out the
source of all my wiring demons, it's a joke that went horribly wrong.
