I found some 36 Dell's at a swap meet, rebuilt them and put them on my
motor. The problem is that at idle cylinders 1&amp;3 aren't operating. Once it
gets past the idle circuit and starts using the bowls their fine. The
cylinders are getting spark, ive checked all the jets and their fine. Im
wondering if it might be be the those tiny ball bearings(cant remember what
called at the moment) but the fact that its happening on both sides is whats
got me, A. Stumped or B. I did something wrong. Ive rebuilt a few sets of
Dell's before and never had any problems. Any ideas?
