OK, Harry.  Now tell us about those cold Fresno winters.

&gt;Seems to me a 110v bathroom heater with an extension cord could warm 
&gt;up the interior of a bus and defrost the windshield while you're 
&gt;caffeinating in the morning. Get fancier with a timer of correct 
&gt;amperage. I suspect electrical costs are cheaper than the gas the 
&gt;engine would burn to heat the interior. Don't neglect to warm up the 
&gt;engine.
