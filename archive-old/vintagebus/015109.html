Folks, we're talking two different organizations here.  There's VW,
and there are the dealers.  They each have somewhat different
incentives - VW wants to take over the automotive world (witness all
their acquisitions; it's a required trait of large companies,
really).  The dealer wants to sell new cars, because that's what he
makes commission on.

The result of the above differing motivations is that VW can want to
encourage the continued existence of their older products as
advertising.  The dealer sees it as a lost sale of a new car.  As long
as the dealers are motivated by selling cars more than by selling
parts, that won't change.  And quite frankly, the mark-up on most
parts, although larger in terms of percentage, is much smaller in
absolute value than on an entire vehicle.
