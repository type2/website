Enjoy your drive ins while you have them.

Here in L.A. area there are currently 0 operating drive in theaters.  All have
been sold for their land by the big movie theater chains to be developed to
more shopping centers or some other lame waste of space.  Just 5-10 years they
were plentiful ...now there are none.

I miss them.   My truck would be a perfect platform to watch movies from during
the summer.

&gt;  The Hoosier Volks have had a camping event at a local Indiana drive-in for
&gt;  the past few years, and it's one of my favorite &quot;events&quot; of the season.The
&gt;  owners of the drive-in allow us to camp out over night and feed us coffee
&gt;  and donuts in the morning.They also advertise the event to all the locals
&gt;  who cruise the aisles looking at all the &quot;hippie buses&quot;.The following
&gt;  morning is the Hoosierfest Vw. show, which one year was held at a water
&gt; park.
&gt;  My kids favorite(drive-in movie and water park fun all in one Vw. show !! )
&gt;         Have Fun !!
