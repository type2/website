&gt; Go to Sears, and buy their 1.5 ton ($30) small floor jack, and while you're 
&gt; there, get two nice jackstands too. I did this 12 years ago, and everything 
&gt; still works great, and the jack is small enough to disappear under the bed.

Hi Volks,
That is definitely the way to go!  Not only can you change flat tire, but you 
can R&amp;R the engine/clutch, &amp; even the tranny if need be.  We made a cradle 
out of wood to put the jack on to keep the wheels off the floor in the bus to 
keep it from rolling around!
