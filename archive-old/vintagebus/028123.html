Those of you who do this swap thing as a business....(don't worry we know who you

pit enthusiasts can't  the more we spend on fees the less we spend at your swap
spot.  Gets ya think'n don't it?

&gt; Hopefully you will make enough money at OCTO so you can spend a little of it

&gt; few extra bucks in costs......and its only once a year..........
