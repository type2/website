These were difficult for me to locate, your mileage may differ, here's the
facts:

After an approximate 1 week search, I found Barndoor front shocks are still
being produced at a reasonable price.

Brand:             Monroe
Part #:            LE100002
Compressed Length: 8.5&quot;
Extended length:   12.875&quot;
Eye size:          5/8&quot;
Color:             Black

This stock is in their &quot;Limited Edition&quot; line so it normally must be
ordered.  The local Kragen/Checkers warehouse parts store just happened to
have 3 sets in stock and they were the cheapest at $42.99 for a set of two,
so I got lucky.  It was worth calling around to the local Monroe dealers as
price and delivery times varied, including one store which informed me &quot;They
would have to be special UPS'd for $xxx and it'll take a week.&quot;  Can you say
SCAM?

It is a normal eye-to-eye style and did not come with bushings to drop the
eye size of 5/8&quot; down to 1/2&quot; (M12).  I was unable to find these bushings at
the Hardware store but found them at my local Fly 'N' Hi jacked-up truck
parts house.  They were nice and gave them to me.  Felt like I was in
another world in there...


Good luck in your parts searches,
Everett Barnes
