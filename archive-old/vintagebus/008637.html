Does anyone know if some one is making the interior trim pieces for deluxe
interiors? I am upholstering my bus and I would like to install the trim
pieces on the new panels. I hope to see some of you at the solvang show I am
going to try make it there with my bus but it was giving me some troubles
today.

    It appears that the 09 distributor popped up and left me stranded today.
The distributor was good and tight but it came out of the key below and was
spinning freely above the gear in the shaft. I haven't heard of this happing
to anyone that I know has anyone had this problem? If not it is probably
just my bad luck or something. I Try to fix up the inside a little and the
engine feels neglected. :-)



Sincerely
