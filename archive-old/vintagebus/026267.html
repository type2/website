&gt; this and other metal working/panel replacement proceedures will all be
&gt; available on my new
&gt; web site as it comes to be, stay tuned for future developments,
&gt;
&gt; if you have a great tech tip you would like to share with the type2
&gt; community, let me know,
&gt; and it can be added to the tech tips pages.

Do a procedure on rocker replacement.  Both sides would be very helpful to many
