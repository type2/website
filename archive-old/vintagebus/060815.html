Subject: Looking for tips for Metal replacments and sandblasting

OK,  As i said in my &quot;New project&quot; posting, this 61DC
has more rust repair then i have ever tackled in the
past.  I am looking for any words of wisdom (Besides
having someone else do it) that may be out there.  

I am also looking for either a cheap sandblaster in
the LA/OC (California) area or a place to rent a blast
booth in the same area.

What i need to do is:

-  Lower front Nose.  Inner and outer lower 3&quot; are
rusted thru.  I have read all of Kelly's (Metal
Wizzard) pictures on this but need to re-read them.  I
will either use his panels if i can or find a original
nose to splice in.  The rust is from seam to seam but
is only above the horizontal seam in back of the
bumper.  Basically from that seam to about 1&quot; above
the &quot;V&quot; in the nose.

-  Rockers  Both sides need attention.  Under the 3rd
door needs to be completely replaced.  What should i
use and where to weld from?  The floor and door locks
are in great shape.  Rust is limited to the lower
rocker area above the lower seam.

-  Rear heater tube support.  I think WW repro's this.
 Correct?  I have no idea how to tackle this one. 
Anyone??

-  Front floor plates.  Both sides.  Preaty simple cut
and weld.  Any tips out there?

-  Rust inside the gates.  I acid dipped my last DC
gates to get the rust from the inside out.  I think
pored paint into the inner channel to coat it and
protect it.  I wan not happy with the results though
because the gates &quot;weeped&quot; for over a year later.  Any
other ideas?  Do i have to cut the inner channel open
to get it out?

-  Ripples in the bed.  Someone loaded something heavy
in the back of the bed above the engine.  there is
probably a 1&quot; deep sag all the way across the bed in
the back.  It is right between the 2 bed supports that
can be seen from the engine bay.  Any tips on pushing
this back out?  Any tools out there to do a good job
of it?

Thanks for the help.  I will have pictures of these
areas in about a week.  for now i would appreciate any
all help.

Thanks
Matthew
