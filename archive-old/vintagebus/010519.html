&gt;I just bought a new muffler and I was wondering if I should treat &gt;it with
a
&gt;high temp paint or some other coating.  I've read in a recent &gt;post about
the
&gt;paint Eastwood offers for about 20 bucks.  This muffler cost 38 &gt;bucks and
I
&gt;don't know how much to put into it before it becomes &gt;impractical.  How
long
&gt;does a treated muffler last?  I can bead blast the existing black &gt;paint
and
&gt;apply some tougher coating to the bare metal.  My question is &gt;1) what
&gt;coatings are available for mufflers and 2) how much should I put &gt;into this
&gt;new coating?  Thanx for the advice.

Most of the rust damage on an exhaust system comes from the inside.  So,
except for cosmetic considerations, you will extend the life of the system
very little.
