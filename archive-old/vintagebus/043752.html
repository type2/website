&gt;I have completed my collection of spare parts for the trip and, since it's
&gt;been a recent topic of list discussion, I've listed it all below.
&gt;
&gt;The Zebra Bus had all new brakes (shoes, rubber hoses, s/s cylinder inserts)
&gt;and wheel bearings a year ago, 

I would still include at least a set of front shoes (both sides).  If
you have a seal go out and soak your shoes with fluid they may not be
useable.

&gt;I'm still looking for a marine-style fuel filter/water trap to replace the
&gt;regular inline filter I currently run.

I know diesel vehicles often have a water trap in their fuel filters, but
I don't know if the filter media would be compatible with petrol.  You
might ask at a heavy-truck shop.

Some other suggestions:

Parts:

* General repair materials like flat steel bar, flexible steel strap with
  holes in it (aka plumber's tape or pipe strap), epoxy adhesive, duct
  tape, bailing wire (soft tie wire), clear plastic sheeting, etc.

* A good selection of metric nuts, bolts, etc.  Or just take really long
  ones of every diameter and pitch you'll need and cut them down as
  required, a PITA but doable.

* Battery cable and/or replacement terminal ends for the battery cable.
  Spare ground strap.

* If the Fleetline depends on any relays to keep going, take a spare.
  You can wire around things like the headlight high beam/low beam
  relay but take a spare for anything that *requires* a relay.

* Spare tail-light lens (or fix broken ones with epoxy)

* J-tube to replace a damaged heater box.

* Spare carburetor and/or a couple of carburetor gasket sets.  In
  case the fuel filter is overwhelmed.  :)

* Spare fresh air tubes from fan shroud to heater boxes, or repair
  yours with duct tape.

* Extra air filter elements if it's not an oil-bath filter.

* Intake manifold boots and clamps if it's a 1600-style three piece 
  intake manifold.

* Oil, grease, silicone sealant, etc.
 
Tools:

* Drill bit and drill; either hand-operated or electric, depending on
  how often you think you'll be close to electricity.

* Hacksaw with spare blades.

* Tach/dwell meter, volt-ohm meter, test light.

* First aid kit.

* Rope, at least 30m.  Possibly also some chain, a tree strap, and a 
  hand winch (for winching Bus out of stuck spots).

After all this you just might be able to still squeeze into the
driver's seat.  :)
