Howdy Volks!  Off and on list meber here.  Back on once again, holidays give
me enought time to keep up with the mail.

Anyway, *considering* doing the type 4 conversion into one of my old busses.
Lots of kit out there - both off the shelf and do-it-yourself.  The Joe Cali
do-it-yourself claims to be the only one to retain the thermostat.  Does
anyone else out there know of a kit which uses ther thermostat?  Also, since
this will primarily be a 3 season vehicle (driven seldom, if ever below 40
degrees) for me is the thermostat totally &quot;necessary&quot;?
