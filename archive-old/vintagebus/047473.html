&lt;&lt; I didn't understand that reply either.....
 The only difference I found was the center section of the body where the 
rear of the tank sits. 68 and up it is flat, so the tank has no problem 
sitting on the little platforms where the clamps go. 67 and back is 
different, the center section is bowed up. The 68 up tank is fatter and sits 
on top of the bow. You can't flatten the bow, or else the throttle rubs/cuts 
into the edge. So you get a 2x4 and a big hammer and bend in the bottom rear 
edge of the tank where it sits on the bow. Just enough to get the top to 
clear easily but not enough to allow the tank to sit on the little 
platforms.&gt;&gt;
Hi Karl,
Thanks for the info!  We are guessing you mean by &quot;bow&quot; the pressed ridge in 
the rear of the horizontal body platform for the fuel tank over the tranny 
just forward of the engine.  Thanks again,   Eric&amp;Barb
