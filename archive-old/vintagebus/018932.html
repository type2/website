&gt;&gt; To the helpful and kind vintage bus list members,
&gt;&gt; I'm looking for two fuel pump rebuild kits:
&gt;&gt;can you help me?

Better keep them looks like rebuildable pumps are going the way of 
non solid state voltage regulators.
look at WW's post 

http://www.wolfsburgwest_dot_com/wired/ww9911.htm

Here's a quote from it:

&quot;Last month, we discovered that our two most common fuel pumps were dis-
continued by the manufacturer; the threaded inlet 40 h.p. pump and the
1300-1600 c.c. slip-on inlet version&quot;

So here is the order of prognostication as I see it:

1, Rebuildable parts discontinued with
non rebuildable parts superseding them
examples:
	a,fuel pump
	b,voltage regulator
	c,Mexican engine case (hydraulic lifter bores)
2, non rebuild able parts discontinued
3, hoarding of NOS parts and exponential price increase
4, dubious vw factory support
5, regulation of AC VW's to collector car / 
   classic car status with hand made parts
6, as the Vee Dubbers demographics shift to 
   nursing home status and gen xers 
   (now in their 40's) turn all solid /restored AC VW's 
   into street rods with Honda power plants

Sorry to be so gloomy, 
I got into VW's because they were easy to rebuild 
and had a good supply of parts It looks like 
that me is drawing to a close 
and the car is becoming a hobby 
with out utilitarian purpose. 
Aloha
