I talked to a local fab shop that I've done some web work for
about doing this for ribbed bumpers.  I have (NO FRANKIE THEY'RE NOT
FOR SALE) NOS ones that would be perfect mold-candidates.  He has
a 40-ton press, and he thinks it wouldn't be big enough for what I'm
trying to do.   It would be a few grand to create the dies.

Too bad nobody grabbed the original dies back in '59 when Hannover
threw them out...
