And I think another aspect to all of this is that in the back of us die-hard
VW nuts is the fact that there are a finite number of buses left.
Eventually, they will not be near as easy to find if you can even say they
are easy to find now.

Every custom job we see that is done crappily, not finished, has all too
often ended up in the junkyards.  We've seen it time and time again.  Sure,
it's your bus, do what you want, but for crissakes, please follow through
and keep it driveable and on the road.  It's the least you can do.
