&lt;&lt; How is the quality
 and fit??  Are they worth the fit?  How about the hardware?  Thanks for the
 response!!! &gt;&gt;
Haven't actually had the time to get into them...I got them right after 
Jerome which is when I threw a rod so I decided to stripe the bus down and 
start the resto...All I have done with the safaris is put the frames together 
and screw them in.....everything else is kinda on hold until the funds start 
rolling in....
