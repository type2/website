Get out your Idiot Book by John Muir.  If you donr have one, go get one.  
Read the section on steering, it has a good description of how it works and 
how to figure out which piece is responsible for your sloppy steering.   

The procedure of figuring out the slop culprit (s)   goes something like this:
borrow a friend and have them sit in the drivers seat of your bus.  slide a 
piece of cardboard or whatever under the front and lie under the bus looking 
up.   you friend gentley moves the steering wheel back and forth in the 
sloppy area, not too fast, not too slow.    See the steering box?  Oops, take 
off the under pedal pan if you have one.  Okay, the steering box is bolted to 
the bus at the front neat the horn, to the right (on LHD) is an arm (pitman 
arm)that moves as your friend wiggles the wheel.  it should move /rotat front 
to back, but not slopp ain and out of the box, or have clunks from there.  
Keep looking...  at attached to the pitman arm is the Drag Link, each end of 
that can have slopp- if either does, you need a new one,    it ruyns back to 
the swing lever linkage, if the arms there goes up and down as it goes back 
and forth, your swing lever is worn, need new pin/bushings/etc (kit) if it 
goes up and down.  Now that attaches to a tie rod, one to each wheel.  Are 
either bent?   any of the 4 ends slopp with motion?   They should not.

now climb out, and jack the bus up in the front.   take a front tire at 3 and 
9 and wiggle play is bad. That indicates that one or more of the previous 
parts are bad/ and /or your wheel bearings are too loose.

 Now at 6 and 12-  if there is play there your king or link pins are bad, or 
your wheel bearings are out of adjustment. 

There are lots of bits in there, some are pricier and more work to replace.  
a drag link tends to be easier than replacing king pins.  Hope this helps you 
track down the culprit.

 Howdy folks -
 I think the time has come for a new steering box for my '67 Deluxe.
 I have been having *terrible* steering play with my bus for awhile now. Not
 just annoyingly loose, but down right bad!
 
 I took my bus in to a VW dealer to have new tires mounted, they tried to be
 helpful and make an adjustment trying to tighten-up the play in the steering
 wheel - all it did was to cause the steering to stick in the corners and not
 return on it's own.
 Not helpful. I made them 'unfix' it.
 
 I have reviewed through my plethora of repair paperwork that the PO supplied
 me with and discovered that both tie rod assemblies were replaced (incl.
 steering drag link arm) not too long ago. It may be possible that they
 weren't installed correctly or they have nothing to do with the problem at
 all.
 
 I am not certain if busses have 'king pins' but I remember an old truck that
 I used to drive had similar problems w/ the king-pin being the culprit. Can
 I get rebuilt or new steering boxes or is this a junk-yard dive sort of
 deal?
 
 In addition there are times when it feels like the tires track together well
 enough while I am making a turn but on the straight-a-way, it feels like the
 aren't tracking together. But it's hard to tell if it is due to a steering
 problem or a wheel problem. Are there any good ways to narrow this down?
 
 I would appreciate some helpful hints on this.
 thanks
