Hi Adam,
Sounds like an oil leak most likely from the FW seal.  If oil lubricates up 
the clutch disc just enough, to make it suction to the FW smooth surface 
after the clutch disc has polished itself to the FW clutch area.  We actually 
score the FW clutch surface with radial lines about an inch apart on the 
outer diameter with a piece of hardened steel to prevent this from happening! 
 The side of the tip of a drill bit bigger than 1/4&quot; scraped by hand across 
the FW surface will do the trick.  So fix your oil leak and score the FW to 
help prevent this from happening.  Also make sure the oil channels and drain 
holes out of the FW clutch area are all clean and clear!  Eric&amp;Barb
