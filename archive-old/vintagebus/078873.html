Subject: RE: [VB] RE: stereo install under dash -- PLUS theft control

This is true, and when I first got mine I used it like Clara does, but
after a year of playing muddy waters in the bus so died, so I don't
think the value wasn't there as much. 
For theft control, the kids that come by, they steal cd players only now
days. This bus in perticular has been rumaged through a few times. Of
the 4 times that I am aware of it, the worse things they have stole have
been a cell phone, a half empty 12 pack of Coke and a Mag lite. Each
time my bus got hit at least one other veichle on the steet got hit.
They always loose there window to a rock and the fancy sterio.

Problem with that is that 8-tracks are now collectors items fetching
good
prices!   ;-)
