&lt;&lt; Hey Robert,
 I went through this for the first time this summer.   I'm assuming your
 bus has a split-case transmission?  Swapping back and forth may be a
 problem.  In mine I had to cut the original front mount out to install a
 tunnel case transmission.  The splitcase axles will not work with the
 tunnel type transmission, but the small nut 3.88 will go plenty fast if
 you get later small nut stuff.  Mine does 70 easy, but it feels good about
  &gt;&gt;
what do you mean by splitcase axles?   

the barndoor RGBoxes are unique to barndoors, and bolt to the bus different, 
though they bolt to the tranny the same.

the little nut RGBoxes were used from 3/55 through 63 .  these were used on 
split case and tunnel case trannies. 
so- the same center section was used from about chassis     20-46xxx through 
chassis 469 xxx.    er- meaning you can swap axles/boxes around from whatever 
to whatever  just use the kind or with adaptor that fit in you bus.  Have 
seen a late tranny/RGBoxes in a barndoor.  

the big nuts were used 64-67.  

the same axle shafts themselves were used 3/55 through 67.  not sure about 
BD, never had to deal with that. 

the nose cone/mounting of th tunnel case tranny is differnt than the 
splitcase tranny.  to install the later trans in a SC bus, you ditch the 
front rubber mount from th e tunnel trans,  and use a metal adaptor plate, 
available from Bus Boys, or local manufacture.  No cutting/ welding 
neccessary.

  I recommend the rubber sandwich kind of shift coupler, and personal 
experience has told me that in a splitcase bus which has the trans hard 
mounted to the body the non sandwich kind transmits additional vibration / 
noise straight foward to the cab.

hope this helps.
