Just received a call from Teresa Koch--Bob Scott of Vintage Parts in
California passed away in his sleep--Vintage Parts and Bob Scott are one
of the class acts in the VW Hobby==Bob is survived by his lovely wife
Beverly-- any one who has had the privilage of knowing Bob Scott knows
what a didicated VW and just VWonderful person he was--I'm certain the
Lord will have a Vintage VW for Bob to tool around in.
