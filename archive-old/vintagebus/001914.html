&gt;&lt;&lt; these are not on all pre 64 rear hatches.  AAMAF, I think it is a late
&gt;62-63
&gt; thang, though I have seen some on earlier ones they looked transplanted
&gt;
&gt; Clara.
&gt;  &gt;&gt;was written
&gt;  From what I have heard, it was for 61 and up buses. Thats how you can
tell a
&gt;60 from a 61 in a wink (if it hasnt been changed of course), but, and isn't
&gt;there always a but. A friends all original 63 deluxe is minus the half
moon???
&gt;Maybe Gunther found an early hatch behind a press and decided to use it?

My old 63 Sundial had it, but I don't know the VIN anymore so couldn't tell
you if it was early or late...
