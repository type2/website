for those that are interested in what US$1700 could
get you in Aus at a fire sale  8-)

&gt;VW Kombi Ambulance 1956, frosted windows, Hella spotlight, overhead red
&gt;cross, internal fans, buzzers and more, very original, extremely rare, some
 &gt;rust in sills, easy restoration, second 1959 ambulance, with Safari
windows
&gt;for spares, $2700


Hmmm,

I have some pics of these buses. One pix is on my web pages
on the 'Rate this site' page.  Go the URL below and hit 'Rate us' in the
left hand frame.

Last time he was selling 
the guy was talking the equivalent of US$5000.  Now he's advertised them
at US$1700!  One needs sills, doglegs, engine hatch hinge carrier
but it has all the ambo stuff (glass, jailbars) and the interior
is really good!  The other is a parts bus.

Pity I have enough projects and I'm broke (and have decided an ambo 
is probably a bit esoteric anyway.....8-)).
