Hey list,  After sitting in front of this computer reading The List I
thought I might share this story.   34 years old,  2 young boys,  wife 
bla bla bla..   My love with the split  began 15 years ago when a friend
lent me his  magic bus.  The thing was a heap and left me and my honey 
stranded.   But I was hooked.  Fast forward to the present,  I bought a
66 heap with the intentions of getting it running but sold it instead
when I noticed this  65 camper bus on the next street over.   Dropped by
to see if it was for sale and the rest is history.  Didn`t run at first 
but a new 6 volt battery  and an unstuck starter got her going.  She
lasted about 3 months when on the freeway a terrible  sound and great
gusts of smoke sent chills up my spine.  Barely made it home.   The end
to this story is I pulled the engine split the case and rebuilt  this HO
engine with the help of John Muir`s book.    Jon   65 Sundial runs great
