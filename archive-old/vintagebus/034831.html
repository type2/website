&lt;&lt; This at worse results in a clutch cable needing to be adjusted a turn or 
two!  Not the five to fifteen minute adjusting and checking back and forth, 
up and down! &gt;&gt;

Doesn't anybody adjust the clutch like I do?  Just tighten up the wing nut 
(or other adjuster) and pull the cable slightly to the side:  when it feels 
like there's just a little bit of play until the t/o bearing touches the 
pressure plate, then it's right on!  None of this getting extricated and 
pushing on the pedal for me.
