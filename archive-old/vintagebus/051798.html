Subject: RE: [VB] Tom Conners' Roof Racks!

Ed,

I got the Dark Grey powdercoat, with metallic flake.  Imagine the whole rack
dipped in almost a plastic coating.  It has a sheen to it.  I was expecting
more of a flat finish.  Very impressed.

$425.00 Delivered by Freight truck to FL all the way from WA, where Tom
lives.

There you have it!  Tom should be charging more for these racks!  They are
better than any other rack I have seen.

&gt; Hi Kevin,
&gt; I've been interested in a rack from Tom too . . .
&gt;
&gt; Can you tell me how the new Powdercoat finish is?
&gt;
&gt; How much did it cost to ship to you, and where do you live?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for your help,
&gt; Ed

&gt; &gt; Hey,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I just got my 6' rack today from Tom Conner.  Wow!...What a rack!  It is
&gt; &gt; currently the nicest thing on my bus.  I can't say enough.  Tom was a
&gt; &gt; pleasure to deal with, and his product is outstanding.  Thanks Tom!
