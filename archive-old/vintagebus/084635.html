Subject: Re: [VB] Changing from swing axles to newer CV joint axles

I am also running and IRS rear end in my '66 Westi.

My input would be to buy the Bus Boys bolt in kit.  Yes it is expensive but 
worth it if you do not fabricate.

Mine is a mutant conversion as it is 944 trainling arms, Thing output 
shafts, SAW floating axles, 944 disc brakes, Phone Dial 52.3mm offset wheels 
on 205/65/R15 tires, Old Speed swing plates, Bus Boys mounts, and urethane 
pivot mounts.  All new bearings in the arms.  Used T2 CVs.  New boots and 
bolts kits.

Also I added a Whiteline rear sway bar (aircooled_dot_net exclusive) and that 
rocks!  The negative is that it is not optinal with the Bus Boys clamp on 
trailing arm mounts so it is out of allignment...  Later I will weld in 
mounts (Old Speed) and correct that issue :)

Oh I am running a '74 Super Beetle single side plate IRS tranny.  It is 
geared a little high for my taste, but effective.

I could not quite get stock ride height out of my setup.  I am like 1/2&quot;-1&quot; 
low in the rear.  So in the future I will probably put in Avis (?) adjusters 
in the front to level it.

Also the e-brake cables still need further refinement as I do not get &quot;full 
pull&quot;.

For me the 4 wheel discs were essential so that was the motivation behind 
the oddesey.

Good Luck,
Adrian Pillow
