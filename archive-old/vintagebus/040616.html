&gt; I just got a few prices and it seems that everybody charges different.
&gt; Unfortunately my core can't be used so I'm gonna end-up paying
&gt; that too if I decide to go with the rebuilt one. Which is better in your
&gt; opinion? Rebuilt or brand new?


Speaking of this, I have been offered a really good deal on some new _dual
port_ 1600cc heads from a supplier in Europe.  These are unique because they
take a bare VW/Brazil head and assemble it with all new German TRW valves,
etc.  They build them this way because the quality is better than the 100%
Brazilian ones (which is normally all you can get).  This is as close to a
brand new German head as you can get.

Projected price is $99 each plus shipping, give or take a few bucks. The
only reason the price is so low is that they are overstocked so they are
giving me a quantity at their cost. Can I get a show of hands as to how many
people would be interested?  I need to make a decision within a day or so,
although delivery from Europe would take about 6-8 weeks.  If you want to
reserve a pair, let me know; you will not be billed until they ship.
