&gt; I recently saw the article in Hot VWs about installing Bosch
&gt; H4 halogens on a '67 &amp; later bug.  That got me thinking, why not on my
splitty??


No reason why not.  An H4 headlight kit will significantly increase
visibility.  I have a generic kit (basically a Hella ripoff) for $34.95
complete, including lenses, bulbs and all (one $35 kit does both sides) -
part number HQ6014 on the website.  This is a drop-in replacement for your
stock sealed-beam headlights.  It includes 12 volt bulbs, but 6 volt ones
are available separately (part 938 867, priced each).

For those with more bucks who want the name brand, I also have Hella H4 kits
(part 938 874, priced each), but they run more than twice the price of the
generics.  Worth the difference?  Maybe.  The dispersion pattern is a bit
better than on the generics, but even the generics are a big improvement
over the stock sealed-beams.  So spending as little as $35 complete and ten
minutes worth of work would be enough to improve your headlights.  This is
such a cheap and simple upgrade that I don't know why everybody doesn't do
it.

A couple of notes on installing and using H4's.  First, technically H4's are
not street legal, although I have never heard of anyone actually being
hassled for this.  I used them for years on my bus. I figured that
worst-case I'd switch back to the sealed-beams at inspection time, but never
ended up having to. There is a Hella kit available that is street-legal but
it puts out significantly less light output than a true H4 and therefore
isn't nearly as popular.  Secondly, it's worth noting that H4's do draw more
current than stock sealed-beams.  This means that if your headlight wiring
is poor or your connections corroded, you may discover the problem when you
replace your bulbs with these ones that draw more current, because they will
put more of a draw on your system. With the standard 55/60 watt bulbs, your
stock wiring should do just fine, as-is.  But if your wiring is sub par, or
if you opt to put in the ultra-bright 12-volt 80/100 bulbs (overkill in my
opinion), you can install a simple relay that allows the headlights to draw
current from a more stable source (i.e. directly from the battery) while
still operated via the headlight switch. Any basic relay of sufficient
capacity will do; try an auto parts store or even Radio Shack.  Of course,
check all connections for corrosion or looseness first, as this is the most
common cause of electrical loss.
