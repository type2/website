Subject: Center link pin replacement

Hi all!

Decided to tackle the center link pin and bushings on my 67 deluxe 
today.  Ordered the pin and bushing set from Wolfsburg a couple of 
months ago (on a tip from VWHoward), and waited in line to &quot;borrow&quot; 
their ream.  They shipped the parts and the ream together when the 
ream came back from the last borrower (I will send the ream back on 
Tuesday).

First point: I very much appreciate the customer service at Wolfsburg 
West.  Not only did the have the ream to lend, but they reminded me 
that I had a $25 credit I had forgotten about!

Second point: Muir was very helpful!  My only criticisms would be a) 
where does one get a 1-1/8&quot; brass pin to use pounding out the old 
bushings?, and b) he says it is unpleasant work, and that should be 
in BOLD!  I ended up using a 19mm deep impact socket in lieu of the 
brass pin, and it worked well.  I also purchased a brake cylinder 
hone (recommended by Muir) at Sears, and it was almost essential to 
the task - especially in fitting the upper bushing to the new pin.

The bus drives much better than it did!  Still need to replace the 
passenger car tires, but all in all, a worthwhile evolution!

Now I'm going to go take some Alleve!
