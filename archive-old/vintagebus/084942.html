Subject: Bus up for grabs for listees

Howdy folks.....long time no post;

Anyways, if someone is looking for a project I have a 79 Bus I need to get rid of quick.  It is complete and in Montrose, Colorado- about 1 hour south of Grand Junction.

Not rusty, with a 2.0 L FI engine.  Not running, but turns over nicely.  Has middle and rear seats, all glass is good.  Sort out the FI system and looks like it could be a driver easily-I just don't have the time.

I'll give it to a listee for $750.  I have pics available.
