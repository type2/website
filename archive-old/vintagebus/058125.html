Subject: Bus Depot T1 SS Exhaust

I just received a parts order from Bus Depot placed by Snoopy for his engine
build.  Everything arrived nicely and in good order. 

Snoopy indicated previously that he got the SS muffler from Bus Depot.  I
had not seen one of these units before so of course I was curious as to the
quality of the build...  Let me just say that this system in very nice!  The
fit and finish are good and I am surprised Ron sells the kit at such a low
price, about $100.  (unfortunately it looks like the webpage is having
difficulties so I cannot access the PN)

The only beef I have with this setup is that the exit tube is metal (Dansk I
think) instead of SS.  Granted it is thick metal so it should be solid for a
long while before any rust through occurs.  That is the only thing holding
it back from being a &quot;lifetime&quot; muffler.  I did not check, but hopefully the
hardware kit that comes with it is SS stuff as well..?

Overall I highly recommend this part to anyone running a stock style
exhaust.
