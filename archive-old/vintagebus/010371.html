When I was at Fort Lewis, WA in 1961-62 my 1st Sgt. had a new 1961 crew cab.
He quickly grew disgusted with having to crawl on the freeway [he was a
particularly impatient person] and had it refitted with
1 : 1 reduction box gears.  The work was done at Autohaus Volkswagen in
Tacoma, one of the oldest VW dealerships in N. America.

I was up to my ears with my own automotive problems then and I don't recall
knowing whether just the gears were retrofitted, or if the complete RB
assemblies were replaced.  But I'm positive the result was a
1 : 1 ratio in the RBs.  That this could be accomplished seemed to be
general knowledge in the local VW community at the time.

In the late '50s, early '60s, Nalley's pickle and potato chip plant in
Tacoma had a small fleet of panel vans and Kombis [purchased through
Autohaus VW in Tacoma].  I know for a fact that some of these vehicles were
fitted with 1 : 1 RBs.  When Nalley's finally disposed of these vehicles in
the early '70s the rigs with 1 : 1 RBs were the first to sell.
