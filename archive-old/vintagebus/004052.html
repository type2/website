This is an excerpt from a message I recently posted to the Type 2 List.  The
descriptions of the effects of even low level carbon monoxide inhalation are
fairly ominous.

    &quot;The table of Carbon Monoxide effects on this page

    &lt;  http://www.aetnaengineering_dot_com/cmd2m.html  &gt;

    is both informative and sobering, especially now that
    we're all maximizing the output of our bus heating systems.&quot;

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  Like I said yesterday my bus is kicking some nice heat, however
yesterday it was smelling a bit like exhaust and making be feel a tad weird
(could be psyching myself out but don't like to play w/ carbon monoxide).
