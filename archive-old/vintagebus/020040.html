To: VWlist &lt;vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

Two points:

1.&gt; It's ironic that Dan and I were the point persons
for Tom Burleson's MADD supported fund drive at Jerome
IX.

2.&gt; Keep in mind that Blue Nelson's Dormobile was
dumped on it's side while enroute to/from Alaska. It
came back the next Summer to win first over my freshly
completed 67 Westy at the June VWClassic meets three
years in a row. I have three Second Place plaques due
to his Dormie! You go!, Blue.
{Point being is that the bus can still become a very
nice show bus if that is you intention. Otherwise put
it on four wheels and drive it.} Do it YOUR way! ;-)
Tell everyone else to buzz off if they dont like it.
