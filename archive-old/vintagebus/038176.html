&lt;&lt; Correct me if I am wrong, but the roof piece was actaully two. I saw this 
in 
 the westy parts manual, then checked in my 67 and could see the seam. Maybe 
I 
 am wrong?

 &lt;&lt; Home depot doesn't carry the correct stuff; neither species of wood,
  grain or size.  You need European sized sheets to be able to do the
  roof pieces, as 'merkin 4x8 isn't large enuf.  Also, you gotta give some
  for the cutting and finishing.  RVB can be more specific.
   &gt;&gt;
  &gt;&gt;
The roof panels in the 65-67 westys I've checked out have one sheet in front 
of each other.  Sometimes the birch used by westfalia is that mirror image 
repeat pattern (I dont know the right word for it, sorry) which mean more 
than one piece of veneer is used on the piece of plywood.

I have re done a couple westy interiors, and haven't found the wood 4x8 with 
the grain running the right way for the long side panel, so used two pieces 
and hide the seam as best as I can.   Hadn't fitted the roof pieces, but 
eventually will in the westy I am driving, having found some 5x5 sheets.   
Ya, $600 is pricey, but there is a reason.

I don't think you can really find the correct grain anyway, something to do 
with the old growth birches being gone or no longer being cut down.    Hard 
to find the even style of grain in the originals.  Dont think they have it.
