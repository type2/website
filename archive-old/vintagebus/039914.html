Hey Guys,
   I figure on putting about 2500 cold hard into my engine (regardless of 
what size in the end I choose)along with a full set of gauges. My question 
was has anyone built a 1835cc engine and if so what type of experiances have 
you had with it...I did the math on it and I hardly consider a .059&quot; 
differance in diameter to be such a big deal between the 92mm and the 90.5mm 
pistons and cylinders. The physics of the matter would suggest that the 92mm 
ones would have a better heat exchange rate due to the less amount of metal 
surrounding the piston itself, granted the support would be lessened a bit 
(not much). I would be more worried about cracking the cylinder than 
overheating but, I have never built one so I would like to hear some 
personal experiances with this engine. I have never actually met a person 
that has built an 1835, only heard the urban legend that they overheat (who 
started this anyway???). Assume all the stops in building a strong engine 
(balanceing,endplay,deck height,etc..), I would like to do this only once 
and do it right. I would very much like to run an external oil cooler w/ 
thermostat just for the added protection if it gets a little spicy. I 
haven't made my mind up yet as to the size I would just like a little more 
info on the oppisite end of the spectrum for comparison. Thanks for putting 
up with this, talk to ya later!
