Wanted to say THANKS for all who replied to my request for help.  There is a 
lot of computer hardware knowledge out there which helped alot.

One of the most useful replies I got went something like this:

&quot;Spend a $1,000 on a computer and in five years it is worth $50.  Spend a 
$3,000 on a computer and in five years it is worth $50, maybe $60.&quot;  

This is so true.  With this in mind I set out looking for a AMD chip or a 
Celeron.  In the end I got a reconditioned 500mhz Pentium 3 unit from 
Gateway.  Saved about $400 over the cost of a &quot;normal&quot; unit.  This one still 
has a one year warranty.  500mhz P3, 128m RAM, 16m video, 8.4g HD, 40x CD, 
56k modem, sound blaster live, speakers with subwoofer, 17&quot; monitor, win 98, 
etc. all for $1249.  This was about the same cost as a comprably equipped AMD 
so I went with it.   

The other GREAT bit of advice I got was that one of the major things slowing 
me down as far as the internet is concerned is my AOL service.  I am also 
looking into a cable modem &amp; DSL.

Thanks for all the help!!
