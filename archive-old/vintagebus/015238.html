My bus has that original screw plate for the safaris already.  Must have
come from the factory that way.

All this talk about putting originals in your bus. I have 1 question for
you all. How did you insert the original screw plate to mount the Safaris in
your buses???? I would bet that 95% of you don't even know about this
moveable plate that mounts the windows, you  just drill and screw, right!
Look at a real stock Safari windshield bus with the windshields removed and
see what I mean. If you want it original, due it CORRECT or don't do it, who
cares about correct latches when you don't even have the CORRECT mounting
plates? Flame me? go ahead.
