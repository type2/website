I've been researching the bus cover thing for awhile too.

The best answer I have come up with so far (comercially) is this stuff
called Tyvek from Dupont

I'ts supposed to be lightweight and very water resiliant.

I'm looking to save a few bucks and find a generic cover for the bus.  A
'custom cover' costs around $120.

I'll keep looking, though.

Being that I have NOT tried it yet, has anyone tried the aterial for another
car?  I believe it's called the Premium cover by Budge available at Wal-MArt
and K-Mart and Target.
