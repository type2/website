yes, yes YES..... you are all right... i know.... Thanks again.... i
conscider you as probably saving my life...
was lying under the bus last night with my new (single) flex hose...
trying to undo a stuborn connector.....  then Clara's voice came to my
ears.......&quot;replace the lot you damn fool!!&quot; mm... got a kid, and the wife,
2 buses, a moke, no job :)... hmm best looking after that lot.

so before i change my mind - the wire snips came out..... snip snip snip....

got a fair few lines to replace now.... getting them today.

if you don't have an 11mm line wrench, get one.  Makes undoing those
connections much easier.   The kind that is in between the open end and the
full circle, so it grips the 11mm hex more fully- one side open to slide over
the line.   Before I got one I mangled a few 11mm brake hose connections.
works better than vise grips.

ps I like the idea of snipping the old lines so you HAVE to replace them.
:)

I was lucky not to have had a disaster when my hose fully failed on me.  And
my hand brake was in order.        See, I was a dirt hippy back then in my
younger wilder days (but never into smoking pot) but know better now and keep
the bus in better order.     A friend of mine who was a potsmoking dirt hippy
had a 63 bus he rammed into someone when his brakes failed, after my dire
warnings to fix them, dipsh%t he was, unconnected to the ground off in the
clouds.  Ya, don't muck around with your safety, your family's and that of
the people you could run into.
