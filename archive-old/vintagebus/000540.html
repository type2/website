Hi Bill, 
Yes, or you could use a 6 volt 200mm flywheel.  Or a 12 volt 200mm flywheel 
have the starter gear teeth machined off, and install a new 6 volt ring gear 
on it.  We know there was at least one shop that did this out here in the 
Seattle area a few years ago.

&lt;&gt;
We have had much better longevity out of the 200mm nine spring pressure 
plate, and if you are not drag racing the spring center clutch disc helps to 
keep down the vibration to the crank from shifting.  We have been wondering 
if the later clutch release disc of the 1970s on would last longer than the 
pre-1970s style.  Either could be used with the nine spring pressure plate.  
Though with the later style the center ring on the pressure plate would have 
to be removed which is easy.
