Subject: Re: [VB] Juson Super Charger

I think that it would run way better in my '66 Beetle
with the original 1300 SP motor.  Wink, wink, nudge,
nudge, know what I mean?  :-)

It cruises at 75 now, just thing how well it would run
with the Judson!

&gt; Hey All,
&gt; 
&gt; My boss scored a judsen from his dad and it's in
&gt; good shape.  He might have 
&gt; it up for sale but believe he'd like to sell it
&gt; locally.  Anyway I was 
&gt; wondering whats the maximum displacement a judsen
&gt; will add performance to.  
&gt; I thinking if it's meant for a 36 horse it would
&gt; probably hurt the 
&gt; performance on a 1600DP.  Could this little guy add
&gt; any thing to a biger 
&gt; engine?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
