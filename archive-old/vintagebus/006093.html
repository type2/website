Subject: Transmission pops out of 4th gear.

I've looked through the archives and the library; I've seen this problem
addressed on the list a dozen times, but now I've come to the point where I
have to do something. My bungee cord must be getting weak because it seems
like the cord doesn't hold my shifter in 4th gear like it used to.
I've seen a lot of responses (but didn't save any) regarding adjustment of
the shift rods to stop this problem. Could someone please post the
troubleshooting procedure for this or point me to where it's already posted?
I know the problem may be in the transmission itself, but I thought I'd try
adjusting the shift rods first.
thanks in advance.
John Flowers
