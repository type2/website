Subject: gas cap, vented or not?

whats up with gas caps? I thought I had an original locking cap(thats what the
PO told me) it never quite sealed too beautifully. Now the fumes have gotten
worse. I recently inquired to the list about new gaskets-and it turns out the
cap is not original...so i though i woiuld try to get a new one of original
design.

now the guy behind the counter is trying to sell me a non-vented cap, I
thought the cap had to be vented, otherwise your gas tank implodes. He told me
had never seen a vented tank for a bus.

anyone know? if i need a vented cap where do i get one?

this is for a '65 kombi.

thanks
