I understand that if I use ONE volt-a-drop with a 6v wiper motor on a
12v-converted '65 I will fry the wiper motor... how do I use *TWO*
volt-a-drops in series (??) to operate the wiper motor without destroying
the workings?
- - - -  -- 
it depends on the type of voltage drop.   I put one in the 59 i used to have,
and one was fine.   I put one in my 65, and it didn't slow it enough, so I
added another in a series.

Hooked it up between the wiper switch -  
disconnected power wire from switch to motor
added wire from wiper switch to first voltage drop.
added wire from first VD to second VD
added connecting wire with spade connector at end to 2nd VD
used a VW connector (one of those plactic thingys like unde rthe dash where
the turn signal switch connects to things)to connect wire from 2nd VD to wire
to wiper motor- 

this way I left the stock wires intact.
