The difficulty could be in a bent or worn gear shift lever.  I'd check it
and replace if that's what you find.  There is always the possibility that
the clutch cable, throwout and/or clutch are faulty.
Where abouts does the clutch pedal sit when the clutch begins to first
grab and engage?  Near the floor?  Near the end of the pedals movement?
Some clutch cables will stretch before snapping, and this stretching will
cause the adjustment to go out of whack.  Have you had to adjust this more
than once lately?
Hopefully it's not a faulty gear synchronizer.  That requires a bit more
work than you're probably up to.
