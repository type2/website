&lt;&lt; Most retail outfits don't know this, but if you buy something mail order,
 and it is shipped by common carrier, namely, UPS, FedEx, (just not the
 stores own vehicle) you are only required to pay 7.25.  Not the rate of
 wherever it is that you &quot;bought&quot; it.
 
  &gt;&gt;
yeah and being a resident of sales tax free oregon I supposedly can purchase 
items in neighboring states (or any state?) whip out my OR ID and decline to 
pay them tax. but try explaining that to the pimple faced kid at the counter. 
BTW from now on all items I sell on ebay will carry a 25% state sales tax. 
FREE SHIPPING!
