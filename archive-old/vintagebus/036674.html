Hi List,

Few Q's for you this monday morning.

I just picked up an early Empi filter pump. It is of the type with a longish
neck to the filter. It's very well made and in good shape with all
dimensions within spec. On fitting it up I was wondering whether it might
increase oil temps due to its' to the hot silencer box. Anyone got an
opinion or experience they'd like to share on this one?

Also, it has a threaded hole(currently blocked with a bolt) at the pump end
of the assembly. The hole is continuous with the oilchannels and I assumed
it was for an oil temp sender or as one of the connection points for
plumbing in an oil cooler. Any ideas on that one? I think that the filter
pump assembly is from the '70s if that helps at all.  

I remember reading a Hoover sermon that mentioned a 'sandwich' fitting that
would allow one to plumb in an oil cooler circuit  between the filter pump
housing and the filter. Anyone know if such a device exists anywhere other
than in my fevered imagination? I like the idea of some extra oil coolling
capacity if and when needed. If these 'sanwich ' adaptors do exist, can they
be set up to bypass the auxiliary cooler when oil temps are below operating
temp like with more traditional auxiliary cooler setups?  

TIA for any help.
