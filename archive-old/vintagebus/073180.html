Subject: Jerome Weather?

Just saw on tv (and we all know how reliable THAT is),
that Flagstaff has just set a new record with 18
straight days of measureable precipitation.
Does this mean Jerome will be a mudbath/swamp this
year? 
Anyone in the area with an accurate update? 
Wanna know if we should pack the waders.
