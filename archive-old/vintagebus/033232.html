They had it last year at the classic,,,
People keep bitching that its not available yet.
I think WW bought the tooling from Mark Adair on the jailbars and rear seat 
bars, he has been making those for years.

&lt;&lt;anyone seen this?

http://www.wolfsburgwest_dot_com/wolfsburg/chrome_moldings/bus.htm

they claim to have the beltline molding in stock, the shiny part not the
plastic! an entire set 23 window or 21 window for $400.

Jailbars they say coming at the end of this month...

is this old news, or something new?

take care,

Steve
