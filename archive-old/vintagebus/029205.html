Subject: '63 Engine Install Trouble 

Hey All-

I'm usually just a reader and learner but I've got some trouble that
needs all your great help.  I have a 1963 camper that I pulled the
engine out of back in June to do some things.  I put in rear axle boots,
changed the rear main seal (actually this was done by a local shop for
me), put in a new clutch, and put in a new gas tank.

Anyway, about 2 weeks ago I tried putting the engine back in and after
getting it all bolted in and re-hooking everything up, I found that the
engine wouldn't turn.  (with starter or with wrench on the generator
nut).  It would turn partially but then clunk and stop.  So I pulled it
back out thinking that somehow something wasn't lined up properly with
the spline coming out of the tranny.   Nothing on the clutch looked
damaged.  I could turn the tranny spline no problem and with the engine
out I could use a wrench to turn it no problem.

So after being gone and then sick for a week, I tried again last night.
Same problem!!  What's weird is that as I put the engine in, I keep
turning it with a wrench as it was fine until after I tightened down all
4 mounting nuts.  What could be wrong?  Did I somehow install the clutch
wrong?   I used to have a '70 and did a clutch on the one twice and
never had problems installing that engine.

Any help would be great as I'm seriously frustrated.  Thanks!

Mike
