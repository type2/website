Yes.  If the case warps, there are a couple of causes:

- it was torqued down very unevenly and operated at high temperatures
- separated by uneven pressure (like, say, using a screwdriver lever
  at one end only)

Not much you can do about the former (I suppose torquing it properly,
running it for a while to warm up, then letting it thoroughly cool off
might work).  The latter just requires that you split the case halves
carefully (even pressure at several points, no screwdrivers against
the mating surfaces, stuff like that).

This guy sounds kind of scary....
