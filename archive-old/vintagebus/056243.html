Subject: Endangered Species.

Hello all. Does anyone know where I can get those stickers? (round, about 3-4&quot; in diameter with bus
in it and words Endangered Species). Any help would be appreciated. I'm going on a trip to Europe in
a few weeks and would like to take some with me as gifts to fellow ACVW fans out there..........

Andrzej
