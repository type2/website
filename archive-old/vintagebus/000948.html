I ordered a new fuse box from BFY a couple of months ago and it was
backwards (i.e. mirror image). I just wired it up backwards and it works
fine (vintage nazis might not like this). After the fact, I think I heard
from the list that it is possible to pull the terminals and put them back in
the frame in the correct order, but I haven't tried.

ps - not knocking BFY here, had excellent service and really fast delivery.

&gt; In regards to the fuse blocks, I remember a post a while back saying that
&gt; some (all?) of the repro'd ones were set up backwards.  Is this
&gt; the case.
&gt; They might work, but I really dont want a backwards one.
