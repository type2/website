More likely than not, the pitman arm has been installed incorrectly onto the steering output shaft.  There is a mark on the shaft and the pitman arm.  These must line up...then adjust your drag link per directions in Bentley.  Of course you want your drag link to be the correct shape, so check that too.

So with these new findings can someone shed new light on it for me? Any
one know of a good photo of a Drag link so I can compare mine?
