Subject: Kelley Park musings, &amp; black wipers ??

Kelley Park this year was great for me.
I decided to park in the side lot and got in with Clara easily at 8:10 AM 
when the show opened at 8 AM. No hassles and right by the side gate. We were 
cheerily let in by Lois and the entrance was right by the main swap area.
Maybe the second swap area in the back created more space than originally 
planned but it was fine.
Here I made two major scores
1) a pristine set of rear over-riders for the 63 singlecab
2) A really nice front bumper with over-riders fro the singlecab.
Now I can USA-ize the pritschenwagen!
On the way out we found a neat guy from Pennsylvania who was selling 
brochures.
He had three 63 commercial brochures
1) Dutch language
2) British European
3) USA version
I bought the USA version and was staggered that some of the pictures were 
identical to the European version except that had added over-riders! I do not 
know if they re-took the photographs or airbrushed in the over-riders.
I will be scanning this in and adding it to my literature site.
BTW I noticed that all the trucks had black wiper arms &amp; blades.
Has anyone ever seen black wiper blades for a 63 splitty?
