Subject: westy center seat for walkthrough
Date: Wed, 12 Apr 2000 06:21:08 PDT
Mime-Version: 1.0

Hello everyone,
I am looking for the small square seat that goes between the icebox and the 
seat behind the driver for a so-42 westy with the walkthrough option.  I 
could build one if I could find the correct vinyl.  Does anyone have a 
cushion or seat back with this vinyl? Don't be afraid to quote me a high 
price.  That makes me want it more.

Boyd Smith
