Subject: helphos spotlite

Hi Folks,
recently aquired a helphos spot light. Neat little gadget, hangs on your
split's windshield with a vacuum device.
Unfortunately it came with no instructions. I'm not sure how to change the
bulb or service the light.
Don't want to break something while trying to &quot;fix it.&quot;
Wondering if someone might have instructions or manual for this guy. I could
borrow or pay owner for a copy?
Perhaps someone knows of a web site?
Thanks in advance,
Mike Turner
