Subject: Re: [VB] Re: help id sc gate part numbers

Ya, they sold a very few vanagon trucks in the USA, but evidently they were common in Canada.   In WA there seem to be a fair number of later splitty and bay SCs, DCs, panel vans, etc and I think a number of them came across the border.  Ever notice how few bay window panels there are?   I think it was a tariff thing that kept them from being brought to the states.

A friend has a tri- star (4 WD Vanagon DC w/ extras) He bought extra gates for it from a Canadian dealership.  Another friend she has a double bubble truck.  are the bay truck latches the same as the splitty ones?  I have no idea.

&gt; double cabs were sold in Germany.  The one or two I've seen had latches that look somewhat like the splitty ones,
