To: VWlist &lt;vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

Used to be VW AR in AZ. Got so relaxed that I sold the
bus(es) and am now searching for a chrome and black
plastic passanger side mirror for my 1993 (92-95) Ford
F150. 
Accepting leads on cheap Toyota FJ60 parts as well.
Think of it this way... At least I'm leaving the hen's
teeth VW bus parts for you hard cores with the silly
dotcom cabbage to spend. I'll put the FORD in 5th gear
and turn up the A/C and CD and put it all in Bonds for
now...

Any help is appreciated.
