&gt;Did the brake Hoses get replaced during the brake
&gt;overhaul 5 years ago?  If not, do yourself a favor
&gt;and replace them all 4.

Listen to Clara's wise advice on this!!!

When I got my '64, the brakes were OK, but not great.
I decided to replace *all* the brake hoses and steel
lines on general principles.  I did a little test with
the old front hoses after I got them off the Bus...
I tried to blow through them, both directions, and
couldn't.  I hooked up my hand vacuum pump to each
hose and I could pull and hold a 25&quot; vacuum on both
hoses in either direction.  This means that the front
hoses were really plugged up - I had little or no
front brakes!  I believe the hoses were original or
an old replacement...they had &quot;Ate&quot; molded into the
rubber.

&quot;The ability to stop is often more important than any
other - cars, humans, whatever.  Do a good slow careful
job on your brakes.&quot;  -  Muir
