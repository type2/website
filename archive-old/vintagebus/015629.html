No.  You do need a battery, to operate the coil and such.

I'd connect them to the battery....

Less flippantly, run the positive to the starter, just like you
normally would.  The more interesting one is the negative.  Running it
to one of the engine mounting bolts on the transmission piece would
probably work, as most of the current's going to be going through the
starter, and that grounds to the transmission.  You should get good
enough grounding between the engine and the transmission piece to
operate the coil.

:  ignition switch somewhere?

Yes.  The usual arrangement is a standard ignition switch, wired up
exactly as you would have it in the vehicle (the &quot;start&quot; post to the
solenoid, the &quot;on&quot; post to the coil/choke wire, the incoming power
lead from the starter where the battery positive connects; sorry,
can't remember the numbers at the moment).

You should also have an oil light connected.  It's probably easiest to
have a bit of sheet metal with the light and switch mounted in them,
and that mounted on the tranny piece facing in whatever direction is
most comfortable for you to see it and tinker on the engine at the
same time.

You'll also need a source of fuel.  Make sure this is a small source,
and that it won't pull off the carb as the engine tries to walk itself
across the floor.  The torque's enough to move the engine around if
it's not thoroughly secured in place.  Apparently pulling the
temporary fuel line out's a relatively common cause of VW garage
fires....
