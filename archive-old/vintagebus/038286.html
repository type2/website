&gt; anyone can help me
&gt; locate this company, I need to buy 2 more jaws so I can get a

&gt; pull all the way around these stuck drums I have to 
&gt; occasionally pull.  This
&gt; puller is made to pull drums be cause of how the jaws have 
&gt; holes with which
&gt; to anchor it to the drum by.


I will try to describe a clever puller that I saw. Super cheap and very very
strong. It consists of two wheels bolted together with good thick threaded
rod. Just enlarge the holes for the hub cap clips for this and leave enough
gap between the rims to slide in a big fat bottle jack. 

Make a cap with a nice thick plate welded to the top of it to thread onto
the end of the axle when the castle nut is removed. The cap can be made from
a plumbing pipe end piece.

Weld a thick plate over the hole in the middle of the inside of the
'outside' wheel(confusing description or what) so that the fat jack can push
against something that is supported.

The cap is screwed onto the end of the axle, the 'inner' wheel is bolted to
the drum and the jack is positioned with its foot on the cap plate and the
lifter on the plate of the outer wheel and the jack gets pumped. 

This thing is cool because of its strength and the fact that it costs
nothing assuming you have some thick thread stock, a couple of rims and a
good fat bottle jack lying about.

Later 

Michael
