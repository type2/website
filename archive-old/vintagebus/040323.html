Hmmmm,

OK, gotta voice an opinion here.
The load it up and drive it stategy
could be an 'easy' winner but if the
torsion arms are really really rusted
and jammed in there it's not beyond the
realms to bend the arms before they eventually
move......

I know they look really tough and you would
think you could never bend em - but you can
and its not all that uncommon. When setting
up the front end camber (by shimming the link pins)
the workshop manuals state a certain minimum no. of shims
have to be on each side and if the arm won't met
spec at this point then it is bent and must be discarded.
They do bend.......

I'd just go long and slow on a seized
up barny front end in order to try and save all the bits
you can (and then after all that you find
the arms are all orribly pitted with corrosion
and will never seal again anyway........)
