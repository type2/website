I think every one of us have had this happen to them at least once. You
don't have to look rich to be one. Salesman that treats  me like dirt won't
get my business and I think will quit soon anyway due to lack of customers.
Logic.

&gt; &gt; When I attempted to look at the new VW's at the local dealer I was
&gt; &gt; asked  &quot;Do you REALLY think you can afford a VW&quot; (in a very
condescending
&gt; &gt; tone). Then the salesman refused to unlock any of the cars. That and he
&gt; &gt; commented on the &quot;Crappy&quot; appearance of my &quot;61 Singlecab...he didn't
&gt; &gt; believe that someone would hack up a bus to make a pick-up. Needless to
say
&gt; &gt; I will never give that dealership any business or referrals.
&gt;
&gt; You should have gone to see the sales drone's manager.  After the manager
&gt; is informed of his salesman's lousy attitude it might do some good.
&gt;
&gt; there's a Rolls-Royce dealership in Beverly Hills where the owner
&gt; occasionally hires someone to come in wearing shabby dress.  His salesmen
&gt; are instructed to treat everyone that walks in with the deference due a
&gt; Rolls customer.  If the &quot;test customer&quot; doesn't  get treated right the
&gt; salesman is canned.  Reason?  Many of the richest people don't look rich!
&gt;
&gt; VWs don't cost all that much less than RR, these days! :)
