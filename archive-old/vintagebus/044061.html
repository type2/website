&gt; It'll take you a little while (like a day) to confirm or refute my
&gt; suspisions. The paint is on the torsion arms right behind that
&gt; torsion arm cover. I discovered this when I parted out a '65 bus; I
&gt; took everything useable from the bus and was very surprised when I
&gt; pulled off the covers and discovered the brown/red paint on the
&gt; torsion arms was still wet, sealed inside the rear end, totally
&gt; isolated from fresh air. Smelled like paint; felt like paint. Tacky,
&gt; easily rubbed off onto something else, including your hands. I'm
&gt; sure it's paint.

&gt; If anyone can prove me wrong, I'll send you an Internet dollar via
&gt; e-mail. :) Joe 

I just took mine out a couple of months ago, and they were very dry.
