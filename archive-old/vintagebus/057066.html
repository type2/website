Subject: Re: [VB] Security Device

the problem with a motion detector alarm is that they have a lot of false
alarms.  False alarms are so common that people tend to ignore car alarms
hereabouts.

A better system is one that senses doors opening, combined with a tilt
sensor that goes off if the vehicle is tilted more than 2 degrees from
where it was set.  This setup should never give a false alarm.

&gt; All this talk about devices I've yet to hear some say there cars had alarms.
&gt; With all the new alarms with motion detectors. at least you'd hear when they
&gt; shake the car or move it. Really now I think our v-dubs are worth another
&gt; 200.00 dollars more for an alarm.only my thought .
