Well, on later splitty Westys like the SO-42 series, the letter designation
denoted what equipment level  package the bus came with.  For example, there
were  A, B &amp; C levels for the SO-42.  I forget which is which, but one was for
a hard top camper kit with no tent or rack.  Another, I believe B, was for a
pop-top camper with rack and side tent.  The third was for a pop-top with out
rack and tent.

Of course you could order any extras like the tent and rack with any of the
trim levels.  I guess these packages were like today's trim levels on modern
cars.

&gt; 2. What exactly does the D23 stand for? I am pretty sure it means that the
&gt; interior package is a SO 23, but what does the D stand for? Deluxe?
