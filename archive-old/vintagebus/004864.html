That brings up a new thought now that we're on &quot;Everything You Ever Wanted
to Know About Sales Tax, But Were Afraid to Ask.&quot;

For those of you who own stores and sell at swap meets and such (in CA), St.
Board is starting to get a little wierd on these transactions.  They are
requiring you to fill out what is called a &quot;Temporary Business Location&quot; and
of course you must charge the tax where the show or swap is set up.   Your
accountant should be able to give you details.

This is not a new rule, but I've been getting hit lately.  I do the sales
tax reconciliation for the largest swimwear supplier in the country.  My
client travels to about 150 swimmeets a year in CA, and St. Board wants me
to do business licenses and seperate forms for each location, even though
they may only be there once.
