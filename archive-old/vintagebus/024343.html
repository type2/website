Subject: Problem with new case

So I'm merrily assembling the engine (got it as a longblock), got the
fanshroud on so the
thermostat rod doesn't bind (finally), and get ready to put on the
thermostat bracket.

DOAH!  The mount for the bracket hasn't been drilled and tapped!  I
guess I'll have to do it myself.

The holes for the engine tin are there.  I would have expected the same
machine at the
factory to do all of them.

Does anyone know of a reason why they wouldn't purposely drill and tap
that hole?

Thanks,
...Markus
