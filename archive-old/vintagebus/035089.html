Hello Jim,

Its a common complaint among some Type II owners looking
for a bit more top end.  Some folks like it slow in the right
hand lane while others want to actually get someplace today.
 
What some people have opted to do is get a stock transaxle 
converted over from the stock ring and pinion ratio to a '73
and later Beetle R/P ratio of 3.875.  I have built these conversion
gearboxes for several list members and other Split window Bus
owners both in and out of state.   Other VW transaxle builders 
should also be able to do this conversion for you as well.  Don't
confuse a reseller like So-Cal Imports with an actual builder.
And keep in mind that you get what you pay for so when they
advertise a stock rebuild for $189.95 and other places sell them 
for $399.95 (me) they aren't the same.  

These converted gearboxes are fairly labor and parts intensive.
What you are doing is running the later splined pinion shaft 8-bolt 
ring gear 3.875 set in place of your keyed pinion shaft 6-bolt
ring gear 4.125 or 4.375 set.  This means that you'll have to get
a 12 volt Type I/II differential housing so your new ring gear will
bolt up.  The 1st-4th gear ratios remain the same as the Type II 
originally was but you have to use a splined .82 4th gear set from 
a later 002 IRS Type II to fit the splined pinion shaft.  Third gear
is a 1.217 ratio from a Type II swingaxle so you can't run the 1.26
3rd that you got your diff housing from.   Also, the early 3rds will
not fit on the later 3.875 pinion due to the large splines are 'full'
length on those vs. a 'stepped' length on the earlier style pinion
shafts.  A bit of grinding will take care of that and the early 3rd
will fit far enough down for the retention snap ring groove to be
exposed.  So you can see that there can be as many as 4 
different transaxles involved with some minor modifications to 
do this conversion which means that it takes about double the 
man-hours.

Good used 3.875s are getting more and more difficult to locate.
What I may be doing in the future is running the 4.125 ring and
pinion with the 1.21 3rd and a .77 4th.  The 4.125s are fairly
easy to locate in good used condition and with the .77 4th give
a final drive of 4.002 vs. the 4.004 of the 3.875 set.   

I'd also recommend using the later O-ringed sidecovers or at 
least the midrange external ribbed sidecovers instead of the 
early 'flat' style whenever possible.  The O-ringed ones provide 
the best oil leak prevention of the three styles.  With today's 
modern flexible sealers like Loctite 518, the mid-vintage external 
rib covers with the paper gaskets can seal just as well as the 
O-ringed ones but every little bit helps.  The late and mid-vintage 
covers appear to be the same and would provide the best rigidity 
while the early flats are thinner.  The early style does have ribs 
on the inside but, again, are slightly thinner which means more 
flexing under load.   

You can run the 113-301-103C 6 volt twin drain plug trans case
for this and open it up for 12 volts should that be required or use
the factory 12 volt twin drain plug &quot;D&quot; case.  There is the later
&quot;E&quot; case which came on the early Type I IRS's but they only have
a drain plug under the diff and that'll add a fifth transaxle to the
equation.  A drain plug under the diff and also under the gear
clusters is the way to go in my book.  

Have your builder add a holder and seal for your Type II nose
cone.  The early non-sealed nosecones tend to weep oil all the
time.  I did one for Steve Fronczek (and Dawn Smyth) for 
their converted transaxle.  

I'm sure there is more but you probably get the point by now.

As you your questions about going IRS....why?  If you want an
IRS Bus then get a post-'68.  Adding IRS to an early Split is 
expensive and time consuming and can possibly decrease its
value over time.   For cruising the 3.875 X .82 X 1.26 (reduction
gear ratio) will give you a final drive of 4.004.  The 002 IRS
Type IIs will give a final of 4.444 which is better than a 4.375
Bus (4.52) but worse than the 4.125 R/P'd ones (4.262).  While
I have built Type I transaxles for those removing the reduction
gear boxes I really don't recommend it.  And on a Camper I'd
try to strongly persuade you not to.  All that weight being 
supported by one small ball bearing?  I'd hate to see that bearing 
let go with you weighted down with camping gear and 65 mph!  
Talk about a handful!   With the converted swingaxle Type II
trans is pretty much a bolt in.  No can of worms there!

Didn't mean to ramble so much but I've done 3 of these this
last month and have a couple more on tap after Jan. 1st.
