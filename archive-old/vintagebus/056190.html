Subject: RE: [VB] Barn Door For Sale

Hey JB, Your barndoor open.... ha, made you look :-)

JB kidded:
All this talk about how much money barn doors are being sold for has
persuaded me to sell mine. I figure I should be able to get about $10K Grand
for it in this market. Here's the description: Original White paint, All
original, excellent for daily use as is or a great restoration candidate.
Includes all hardware and accessories. The hinges are a bit rusty, but you
can get new ones at the hardware store.  However, I need a weeks notice
before selling it so I can replace it with a different one, I must replace
it immediately so my livestock can't get out of the barn. Will also trade
for an early Porsche 356.   What?!?!?!?!
JB
