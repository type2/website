Subject: RE: [VB] Paint - Mango Green / Seagull Grey

  I have talked to all the paint suppliers we have here and none of them
have ever heard of Valu Pro paints (there is one supplier in Phoenix of this
brand). One suggested that it is made by Val-Spar a low end paint
manufacturer. It is not made by DuPont, PPG or Sherwin Williams. I would
personally stay away from any VALUE paints as they are crap. My SWR buses 2
to 3  year old paint job has gone to crap (OMNI made by PPG). Even PPG
states that there OMNI brand paint is only good for 2 to 3 years. It is made
mostly of fillers with little pigmant and that's what cost the money.
  Cars that we painted 12 to 15 years ago with DuPont Centari or any of the
Glassurit and/or Sikkens paints are still as good today as they were then.

first time painters should stay away from urethanes and try acrylic enamals,
much easier to spray and a lot more forgiven.

&gt;Besides, after 5 years it will be impossible to determine if the paint has
crapped-out because of
&gt;incompatible reducer or because it was sprayed with acrylic enamel by a
novice painter.

That was the idea, Steve:)

&gt;&gt;My question - So whats the scoop on Valu-Pro?

I would also be interested to hear about Valu-Pro.
It looks to be related to PPG, but i can't find it on their website.
It's also at the bottom of the reasonable price scale, sorta like
a tractor paint in acrylic with the availability of tint mix options.
If it is durable and won't fade, it still has to be missing something
in the chemical department that adds cost ( and benefit ) to other brands.
