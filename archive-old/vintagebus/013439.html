Hi Chris,

I have never done anything more fancy than rattle can paint on my racks, but mine aren't really pretty.  I do have one that was powdercoated and it looks great.  I have had friends get theirs powdercoated and they look great.  It does cost a bit, but you would be amazed at how much rattle can paint it takes to paint one.

If you do one in POR15 I would love to hear how it holds up.  I have just started experimenting with this and still don't know how it really works.  It didn't seem as scratch free as it was suppose to be, but it does look like cool stuff.  Anyone have any other experience with POR15?

You could get it galvanized.  This isn't real expensive I don't think, from what a friend said, and the later style racks were originally galvanized.

You could paint it with hammerite.  It would look really funky and custom, but the stuff is pretty durable and is suppose to keep rust away at least some.

Good luck,
Richard


 sandpaper and some silver rattle can paint

sandblaster and taking it down to bare metal followed by an
application of either more rattle can paint of maybe some POR15 carefully brushed on.

media blasted and powdercoated
