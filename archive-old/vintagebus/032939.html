&lt;&lt; Now for the questions.  Since the engine has never been rebuilt I am 
guessing
 the heads have not been replaced.  Therefore they were made for regular gas. 
 Does this mean I have to run super?  I have gotten from the type2 list over 
the years if it doesn't knock you can use a lower grade.&gt;&gt;
Hi Snoopy,
If it is still the original engine build from the factory it should have a CR 
that will be fine for low grade gas.  Though even we in outside temps over 
80F have found it helps to go to mid range fuel, this has helped to drop our 
oil temp about ten F.
 
&lt;&lt;Second question.  If the battery ever does go dead how would you jump it?  
Not too many other 6 volters around.&gt;&gt;  
Best to push start it, and pop it in second.  Failing that then jumpering 
with a 12 volt source will work, but do it quickly, and once started pull the 
jumper cables off quickly.
 
&lt;&lt;The 1500 engine has a governor on it.  What would be the speed it would 
stop me at if it is still hooked up and functioning?  I can get to 60 so 
far.&gt;&gt;
To whatever it was set for or what ever it has worn to.
 
&lt;&lt;The passenger door and cargo doors can only be locked from the inside but 
they both have a cylinder on the outside.  Is something wrong here?&gt;&gt;
Probably need to pull the door panels off and throughly oil up the latch 
mechanisms.  Then graphite up the lock tumblers.
 
&lt;&lt;The sunroof is hard to open on the tracks.  What would be the best thing to 
lube the tracks with? &gt;&gt;
According to the Bus shop manual, Vasoline was used lightly on all parts of 
the lock and tensioners.  This would probably work fine for the tracks.
