&lt;&lt; Does the steering dampner attach to the tie rod clamp on the top of it or
 the bottom of it? I have 2 different sources and one has a 58 and says its
 on the bottom of the clamp and one has a 56 and says his on the top. I have
 a 57...so which is it? or is this a year to year thing or does it really
 matter?
 Any help appreciated

the end of the tie rof thast attaches to the beam is shown as being under the 
clamp that clampos to the swing lever.  I dont know if it makes a difference 
if you turn it upside down, but below is what the 59 manual shows me.
