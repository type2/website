I just got off the phone with Lenny from West Coast Classics. he is now
manufacturing replacement baltic birch panels for 64 -67 westys.cut ,sanded
and urethaned,all you need to do is install them.
Here's a link to the pics.

He also is now selling repro roof racks for buses for only $250.
He doesn't have them on his site just yet , but they are available
call 714-871-1322
I have no affiliation with WCC , just a very satisfied customer.
