Subject: Re: [VB] Are 67's supposed to have reverse lights??

Ah, the myth of the model year  is exposed again.   VW made a lot of changes at random times.

reverse lights were standard for exports markets as of partway through the 67 model year.  

dual circuit mc ditto, but at a slightly differrnt time.

&gt; I have recently picked up a bus with no title, VIN
&gt; numbers tell me it's a 67, but then someone else told
&gt; me that 67's have reverse lights, and this bus has none.
