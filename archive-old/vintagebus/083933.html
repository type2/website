Subject: Re: [VB] BBBX - Photos!

Hello all. Its been a year or two since I was around
this site much. I've gotten back more in to my
Studebakers, but still keep one eye out for the loved
aircooled Vdubs. 
 
My wife and I drove from North Central Florida to
29Palms California to spend Christmas with my daughter
and son-in-law that is based at the 29Palms Marine
base. We left on Jan 5 and saw the Parker Damn (looked
bigger when I was a young kid) and then on to Lake
Havasue. We did the bride thing and it was an awsome
site to see, but I guess we were there a little early
for the BBB turnout. If it happens again next year and
the kids are still in 29Palms, maybe we can stop by
and enjoy the fun. Or have them go out for us, but
they wont have a VW. 
 
I was looking at the pictures that people had taken
and it looks like a wonderful place to have a campout,
although I wasnt keen on all the headwinds I was
fighting. 

So maybe next year,
David Engle
