Subject: Re: [VB] Front Suspension Question (big pivot thingy)

&quot;tyep2_at_thebugbox_dot_com&quot; wrote:

&gt; Ok, I unbolted the '64 front suspension to put in my '60.  Very easy, got it
&gt; out (had to cut the shift rod, but other than that it was ok) without
&gt; killing myself.  Noticed one problem though. On the lower beam, there is a
&gt; pivot pin(I don't know the exact name, so please bare with me on this), dead
&gt; center.  On the '64 beam, it has about 1/16&quot; of slop in it.  I've look at
&gt; Wolfsburg west, and a few other places, and I don't see any parts for this.
&gt; Has anyone had any experience with this part being loose?  I unbolted the
&gt; arm from it, and slid out the huge pin, and it is worn both on the brass
&gt; bushings, and on the pin itself. Before I bolt this suspension onto my '60,
&gt; I want it to be right.  So please, any help would be greatly appreciated.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
