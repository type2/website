The engine is still aircooled, but the computer is now water cooled. Whats 
up with that?

Yep the computer now has a waterblock and a radiator. And I am learning alot 
about transfering heat.

I have decided that the next engine for my bus must have good tourque and 
good mileage.

So, sometime in the future whatever bus I have then will have a TDI VW 
diesel engine.

I think it makes sense.

BTW my drag bug is likely to end up with a stock engine. I like the 36 horse 
engine on a round town car.


Makes sense again..........

Jason.
Its friday, and Ill stand by it.
