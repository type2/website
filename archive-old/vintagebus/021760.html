&gt; this is not your mcode plate.   the m code plate is on the forward side of
the

In that case I don't have one.
Either on the '67 or the '63.

well, did you pull the back of the pass. seat forward and see a spot where the
2inch by 2inch plate had been removed?   it would be visible by the lack of
paint.    They were installed as of around ch# 400 000 ('58 or '59).   of
cours eif the bulkhead was hacked out it is gone.
