Hi,

The top three that I see:

1. Bad economy.
2. Less than stellar business management/performance.
3. eBay and other used part outlets have proliferated.

When this news first came out late last year (October) it was cited that
orders had crashed and they were unable to pick up income (they were
already in a tight position).

Conrad

&gt;&gt;I heard last week that RMMW has filed for bankruptcy.  Source cited was
an article in one of the USA VW magazines.&lt;&lt;
