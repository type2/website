dead, after secret spy photos discovered him in a
D*dge dealer's showroom, peering in the windows of
double-door Voyagers with child seats.

Would it scare you to know that I subscribed to

Oh, gosh- I need a trip to a go-go bar or something.
Pregancy has made me a tad antsy for *some* reason.
Grrrr... I can't quite put my hand, er, I mean, finger
on what it might be...
As for the Dodge thing I goes, I am currently
seriously dreaming of a Plymouth that has Paula all in
a rage. I would own it in a heartbeat if I could sell
the Barnambultor. &lt;hint!~talk to me folks, talk to
me...&gt; Might go on a road trip early tomorrow to see
just how close to alimony AND child support I can
come. Am installing seatbelts in the rear seat of the
'67RFH this weekend.
