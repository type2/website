A turnbuckle is a hardware device that consists of a threaded body
with corresponding threaded rods coming out each end.  The threads
are oriented such that when you turn the body, both rods move in
the same direction, allowing you to pull something and use the
mechanical advantage of the threads, and correspondingly loosen
it by turning  in the opposite direction.

To make a roofrack clamp with them, you'd have to modify one
end of the turnbuckle to fit the rack, the other to fit the
rain gutter.  You'd then tighten the turnbuckle to clamp
the rack down to the roof.

Any hardware store will have these.
