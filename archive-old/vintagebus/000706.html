&gt; I'm afraid that I have to disagree about the theory that the tags were made 
&gt; a week ahead. 
JP, yeah it was kind of a joke or wild speculation, anyone really know?  This 
brings up a couple good points which I have not heard mention of.  What 
purpose did the m-tag serve in the production process.  When was the m-tag 
actually affixed to the body in the production process.  

EARLY: Was the tag put on as soon as the body was assembled or partially 
assembled?  Then the workers down the lie would know: &quot;Oh this one gets the 
mouse gray paint&quot;, &quot;this one gets six pop outs&quot;, &quot;this one gets a gas 
heater&quot;, &quot;this kombi is going to Westfalia, so it gets paint in the cargo 
area&quot;, etc... And if the tag was put on at the start of the process, how did 
they know when it would roll off the production line to give it a date?  They 
would have a good idea, but things do happen to hold up production of the 
whole line or individual units.  

LATE: Maybe the tag was put on near or at the end of production.  Then they 
would know the date.  But also, this would mean that the tag served more as a 
record and for distribution and dealer prep information.  Maybe they tracked 
features through production with temporary indication, like the SK in 
headlight housings.  Could be that units with lower chassis numbers got held 
up in production or had to have more stuff put on them, so the production 
date was later.  

Maybe this has been asked and answered before (I am still reading back issues 
of the list - currently on May, 1999).  Anybody really know?  Okay, how about 
some wild speculation.
