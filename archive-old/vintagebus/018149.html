Subject: Resto of backing plates
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Thanks for all the opinions on backing plates...I
think I'll do the deluxe version - powder coat.  But
some responses intrigued me.  It seems there are
supposed to be little pieces of metal for each
adjusting star to prevent them from turning
inadvertently?  On the four I have, none have such a
piece of metal, although there are little pop-riveted
sections (top and bottom) right near where the
adjusting starts would be on the front set.  What is
the shape of these little gems?  Does anyone have any
pictures of them?  Could I just drill the pop-rivets
out and make new pieces to replace what broke off and
rivet them back on?  Are there supposed to be some for
the back ones as well?

Thanks for reading,

Paul
