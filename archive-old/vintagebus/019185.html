2 points-

first stove pipe is a good and inert replacement for the factory heating duct

second point i would be willing to bet thtat the orignal insulation is
aesbestos containing (i.e. carcenogenic)- don't want to breathing that stuff
in

&gt; Curtain helps a lot, particularly if you can seal the edges relatively
&gt; well.  Insulating all the under-bus air ducting helps a lot, as well.
&gt; I'd bet you've got rust-throughs in the main duct, that are hidden by
&gt; very old, rotted out insulation wrap.  A popular replacement procedure
&gt; appears to be to cut out the old duct completely and put in a section
&gt; of PVC pipe instead.  And then insulate *that* with something that's
&gt; non-absorbent.

I keep hearing this one and can't help but cringe each time!

PVC (or more likely ABS in the size involved) isn't made to take the
temperatures that a healthy VW heating system can produce.  It probably
won't melt, but it'll outgas something you don't want to breathe.

There are metal alternatives that will be a lot closer to stock and which
will work much better.  Check out your local home center.

Insulating the pipe is a very good idea.  Leave the insulation as fluffy
as possible, since it's the _air_ that does the insulating, not the glass.
