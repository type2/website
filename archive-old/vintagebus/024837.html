I have a buddy with an original bus parts manual.  This one covers
everything from October `52 thru `67.  It is extremely large..probably
500-700 pages I am guessing. It is similar in size, if not bigger, to
the Bentley reproduced Workshop manual for `63-`67.

He had run off a few copies of the manual years ago and was selling them
at $60 each.  I can check to see if he has anymore or can possibly get
some more.

Email me if anyone is interested and I will contact my friend.

&gt; Over the years, I have collected a number of NOS parts, but have no idea
&gt; what they are for.  This past week a parts book came up in E-Bay, but even
&gt; though a couple of us went in on the bid, we were outbid at the last
&gt; moment.  I am at the point that I would like to get rid of the parts I will
&gt; not be using to restore my busses, but I have no idea what to sell and what
&gt; to keep.
&gt; 
&gt; I am looking for someone nice enough to sell me a copy of their parts
&gt; manual.  If you have any of the manuals, either for bus or bug, what would
&gt; it take for you to drop it off at a quick copy place, then send me the
&gt; repo.  There are a number of us who would like copies of the various
&gt; manuals, so while at the copy place, you might just have them run off a
&gt; number at one time.
&gt; 
&gt; I do not know how many pages are in a manual, but we are willing to pay for
&gt; your trouble, the cost of reproducing and mailing.
