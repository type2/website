Wanted to join a caravan to the BNNTA. I will have to work Friday possibly 
until 4pm Kansas City time. Possibly leave earlier. Want to get on the road 
right afterwards. Looking to hook up with anyone pushing east from the KC 
area. Will probably go North on 35 and go east on 24 if that works. Want to 
avoid I-70 if possible but if I can hook up with a crew so be it!

Cant wait to see you all and enjoy the bus and other busses.
