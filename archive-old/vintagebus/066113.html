Subject: Re: Lowered Bus Question

AGREED! every darn time this comes up there are people who feel its their 
duty to talk smack to the people who want to lower their bus. if you dont 
have advice on the subject, keep it to yourself!

i have to put my bus on rims to lower it enough to get it in my barn for the 
winter, and every time i do it i think about slamming it. it looks good! :-0

&gt;Let me start with I ENJOY this group and get tons of help from it.  But I
&gt;hate when this comes up, lowering.  Everyone wants to jump in with keep it
&gt;stock.  You know what, it's there's, my money, and we (I) should be able to
&gt;do it like we want and still get opinions.  Isn't that what owning a 
&gt;driving
&gt;Buses are about, being different then everyone else?
