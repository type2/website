Folks, let's put this in perspective.  This lady was probably not a member
of the lists.  She was given a printout of the AIRS list by a mechanic who
was concerned about her, and that is the extent of her connection with us,
other than the type of vehicle she she drove.

Yes, her murder was a tragedy and a shame, but to beat ourselves
over it will do no good for her or us.  Charlie says that her family
doesn't want contact with us, and I can understand their reasons.

It's time to let go, let the wounds heal, and learn from the experience.
