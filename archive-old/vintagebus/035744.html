&lt;&lt; If so, I'd like to paint them orange, but all the ones I've ever seen have 
been a semi-gloss black, similar in color to the backinging plates they kinda 
hold in place.  Also, in cleaning them, they appear to have a small oil 
galley that may run from
 the axle to the lower edge, maybe providing some sort of lubrication for the 
axle riding up against the rubber oil seal. &gt;&gt;
Hi Paul,
They should be semi-gloss black, and the oil galley is to allow any seepage 
of tranny oil past the outer axle seal to go out the inner side of the brake 
backing plate.  Thus keeping the brake shoes clean of any tranny oil.  Very 
good idea to run a drill bit up into these drain holes in the RGB covers to 
make sure the passages are open and clean.    Eric&amp;Barb
