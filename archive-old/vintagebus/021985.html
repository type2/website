If someone doesn't have the cash on hand for a new headliner, and the time (a
lot) for installation, and wants something there for looks, insulation, why
not?   No big deal, very easy to replace later when the new headliner is
purchased.   
This is the fix your bus and drive it, get it together even if you don't/can't
spend a ton on it theory that I have used well, even if now I actually do buy
NOS parts and spend more money on the beast.
