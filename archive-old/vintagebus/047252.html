Subject: Re: removable cargo floor comment?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com


&lt;&lt; Exterior fiberboard would be strong (500,000 psi MOE! WOW), but heavy.  I 
also thought putting down wood, plywood, or fiberboard slates and then gluing 
a rubber mat to them so it could also be &quot;rolled up&quot;.

Opinions and feedback appreciated. &gt;&gt;

Why not just make a trap door about 12&quot; deep and run it the length of your 
cargo area?  This would allow you access to the pan area and still allow some 
support from your floor.

If you wanted the whole floor removable, then why not use diamond plate?  You 
could get this in aluminum or stainless steel.  I have pics of a '59 work 
truck in Germany that the whole interior was done in aluminum diamond plate 
and aluminum peg board with a slide out work bench on the rear deck.  I'll 
try to post the pic later
