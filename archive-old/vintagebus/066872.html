Subject: Re:  Upgrading to good heating [long!]

&gt;... no rust but I was just thinking about investing into some kind of
&gt;a booster fan with a switch.... something I can turn &quot;ON&quot; whenever I
&gt;need extra heat up front. Sounds like a bad idea in the back since
&gt;heating tube comes right from the heat exchanger.

I have seen some cars with blowers plumbed into the fresh air hoses
between the fan shroud and the heater boxes.  That way the blowers
are on the &quot;cold&quot; side.  I think the later Bus blowers worked the
same way; they blew air into the heat exchangers at the same point
as the hoses from the fan shroud.  Once the engine was above a fast
idle, the engine fan provided most of the air through the heat
exchangers.
