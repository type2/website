&gt;Let me tell you it is a helpless feeling. I didn't have an extinguisher but
I was lucky there was a garden hose at the house. I did buy an extinguisher
today.&lt;

Sorry to hear about that piece of misfortune...  It amazes me how some buses
run at all on the ratty rear harnesses that some people have.  People, it is
only a few simple wires, take the time to keep them clean and nice.

ALWAYS CARRY A FIRE EXTINGUISHER!  Not only are we driving fire balls, but
others are too that we could help.  I have seen a few late model cars catch
on fire in mild rear enders even, all Nissan's for what that is worth.  My
father has a friend who came upon an accident that just happened where two
of the occupants were stuck in the car with the car starting to catch on
fire.  Needless to say the man is still in therapy from watching two people
burn to death and he could do nothing about it.  Maybe if he had a fire
extinguisher he could have put out the fire until the rescue people came.

All of my cars have fire extinguishers in them to help ourselves and others
in emergency situations.  Also I suggest carrying a first aid kit for
roadside medical assistance.


Be Safe :)
