Well I took the heads from my engine to the guru and he's going to inspect
them for me.  He won't have have them inspected until the end of the week so
I have until then to decide kind of what I want to do.  I agree with the
advice I have gotten about overhauling the engine.  I have the Tom Wilson
overhaul book around here someplace.  Matter of fact I had 2 of them and
gave one to Charlie Ford when he was here.

I'm trying to weigh all of my options.  I want an engine that will take the
bus easily down the road at 65 to 70 mph.  I was hoping that with the ratio
rockers and dual carbs, that I would have an engine with enough extra oomph
to do the job.  One thing I like about having a stock setup - it's a lot
easier to get replacement parts if you break down.  If you bust something on
those dual webers while you are out traveling, you can't waltz into a
junkyard and snag a part as easily as you could if you had a 34-pict-3.
Then again, if you do the job of rebuilding correctly, in theory, you
shouldn't have a breakdown.   So now, I'm kind of torn between doing a stock
1600 rebuild, purchasing a core, or building a good solid bottom end that
can utilize my 40IDF's.  There's also the fact that I found a good deal on a
Kawaski 440 and prop combo for an airplane that I'm wanting to build next
year sometime (www.affordaplane_dot_com) so I went and spent money that could
have been poured into this engine project.  I took a gamble and lost.
&lt;shrug&gt;

I've also been talking with several listees and I like the idea of using an
85.5 bore but putting a stroked crank for increased torque and displacment.
I just hesitate to take the displacement up to 2 liters because this is the
limit of my 40IDF's AND there is the problem of cooling that Berg talks
about.  1776cc is supposed to be the max you'd want to run in a bus.

So anyway, this is kind of what I'm thinking about.  Basically it's the
money and time issue.  I'll figure something out though.

Later!
