Subject: Re: [VB] Our classic VW's, not

In WA the car has to be over I think 25 years old. I think  it used to have to be 62 or older, but the law may have changed when they made every buy new plates, used to have cars w/ 63 plates and lots of sticker on the driving around. Or maybe I was mixed up on it.   I knew someone who daily drove her 63 SC w/ classic plates.  Doesn't matter what make or model. Doesn't matter whether it is shiny or restored or a total rat case. I didn't need an inspection to do it.   You can use YOM plates or 'classic car' plates.   I think there may another category for 'antique' and for 'horseless carriage' depending on age of vehicle, only difference being what the plate says if you don't have YOM plates.

&gt;  It would be cool maybe if we did a survey on each state's classic plate
&gt; requirements to see what other states think and/or use as 
&gt; their guideline
&gt; for classic car plates
