I subcribe to the idea of doing whatever it takes to
keep these $200.00 POS carburators together. A
fleeting thought was to mention usage of safety wire
ala aviation standards.
As much as I hate working at Boeing I respect the fact
that they insist on using safety wire on darned near
everything. They want to make sure to retain
everything excepting there trained and professional
work force. &lt;naw, I ain't bitter!!!&gt;
I'd suggest routinely inspecting the fuel lines and
replacing them, using clamps on the cloth wrapped
hoses, the JB weld, vice grips, a rasp/file
treatement, safety wire or giving up and moving over
to an F150 if that's what it takes to prevent an
engine fire.
In the meantime someone call me when Boeing gives a
flip about their employees, when Intel stock gets back
up to the 40 per that I paid, when a Republican
President isn't a puppet of big business and black ops
and when VW bus parts are back to a realistic price
for a good quality product.
