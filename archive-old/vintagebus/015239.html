how about one of them 70's-esque &quot;bare feet&quot; that bolts over the pedal?

i have seen factory rubber on the beetle gas pedal but never on a bus. would
be quite a simple install though

Seriously though, I've never, personally, seen or heard of a pedal pad for
the gas in a bus.  Doesn't mean they don't exist, I'll admit the white coats
don't let me out too much...I'd be pleasantly surprised if they are around
:-)  Pedal pads, not guys with nets.  The way accessories are for these
things, I'll bet there's at least an aftermarket one kicking around
somewhere.  I think that'd be pretty neat!
