Mike,

It sounds like a good deal to me. I don't think I could throw one together
for that price. My regular &quot;one size fits all&quot; tow bar cost me at least that
thirty years ago.

I don't know about the rental houses in your area but here in the North East
they don't like to (or won't) rent a dolly without one of their vehicles
that has a hitch. Usually that is a truck or the high dollar big SUV.

If you buy it you will probably get your $80 back the first time you use it,
then when you need to help someone out or need it again, it will cost you
nothing. I stand corrected it will cost you storing it until then, but I'd
bet you can find a place.

&gt; Hello Everyone,
&gt;
&gt; Finally got enough money saved to buy some tires for my bus.  I ended up
&gt; going with Pathfinder 205/75/15 from Discount Tire Co.  They look nice.  I
&gt; have no motor in my bus as of yet, because I want to finish off the body
&gt; work before I begin tackling mechanicals.  Most of the welding in of
&gt; new/salvaged panels is done, I mainly need to do some grinding of weld
&gt; seams, and some heat shrinking where some of the panels warped due to heat
&gt; from the MIG welder I have been using.  I want to move my bus from my
house
&gt; to the local high school where I can work on it at their shop once a week.
&gt; The instructor is much better at heat shrinking than I am, and I don't
want
&gt; to mess up what I've done so far!
&gt;
&gt; I've been talking to my VWFLAPS, and there is a guy locally that can build
&gt; me a bus (not a refitted bug one, but built from the ground up for a bus)
&gt; tow bar for $80.00.  I've never priced tow bars before, is this a good
&gt; price?  Exploring alternatives, does anyone know how much it costs to rent
a
&gt; tow dolly for a day, or to buy a tow dolly?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks!
&gt;
