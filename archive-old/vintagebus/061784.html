 &gt; Subject: URGENT - POSSIBLE STOLEN ORANGE/WHITE TYPE
 &gt; 2 WESTFALIA CAMPER FOUND
 &gt;
 &gt; I am a serving Police Officer in the Lincolnshire
 &gt; Police.
 &gt; I have 22 years service and have been trained in the
 &gt; recognition of
 &gt; stolen/altered vehicles.  Although my knowledge (so
 &gt; far) on type 2's is
 &gt; limited, I have learnt a lot recently.
 &gt;
 &gt; This mail has a personal attachment as well as a
 &gt; lawful one.
 &gt;
 &gt; My wife and I are attempting to find a very clean
 &gt; Type 2 Westfalia (if
 &gt; Poss), and we are prepared to spend up to £6000 on
 &gt; one.
 &gt;
 &gt; During our travels over the weekend we have visited
 &gt; several areas in an
 &gt; attempt to find a van.
 &gt;
 &gt; On Saturday we found a very clean westy for £6000,
 &gt; to my surprise and
 &gt; with little haggling got the owner down to £4800!,
 &gt; and I believe he
 &gt; would have gone lower still!!!
 &gt;
 &gt; I have examined the vehicle (as a private purchaser)
 &gt; and found a number
 &gt; of alterations, V.I.N. plate and chassis number to
 &gt; name two.
 &gt; This van was easily worth the asking price from what
 &gt; I have seen of
 &gt; late, possibly even fetch £7000+
 &gt;
 &gt; Therefore, the reason for this mail is to see if you
 &gt; know of anyone who
 &gt; may have had a ORANGE/WHITE TYPE 2 WESTFALIA CAMPER
 &gt; stolen, poss in the
 &gt; last year. From my little knowledge it was a 1973 &gt;
 &gt; (it had an
 &gt; inspection hatch above engine (1700cc) which I have
 &gt; been told was not
 &gt; introduced until 1973 - but correct me if I'm
 &gt; wrong!).
 &gt;
 &gt; Before I start a full police investigation (not my
 &gt; Police area
 &gt; unfortunately) it would be helpful to have an idea
 &gt; of any likely vans
 &gt; that may fit the description.
 &gt;
 &gt; I am going to forward this mail to as many
 &gt; Mags/clubs I can think of,
 &gt; but please feel free to forward this to any other
 &gt; interested parties you
 &gt; may feel would benefit from it.
 &gt;
 &gt; If anyone wishes to contact me my details follow
