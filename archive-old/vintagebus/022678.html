Start saving for a new transmission, and start looking *now* for a pair of
the plugs for the reduction box plugs.

Barb &amp; Eric will be along shortly to tell you to get a Freeway Flyer
transmission.

&gt;Hi all, I'm 21, and just got my first Bus a 1966 13 window deluxe in July. I 
&gt;could really use advice on fixing a problem with fourth gear. I can drive in 
&gt;fourth but I have to keep pressure back on the shifter or it will jump out 
&gt;of gear. Any ideas on fixing that? I also will be rebuilding the redux boxes 
&gt;soon and wondered if anyone had any advice on what to look out for, common 
&gt;mistakes, and any warning signs I should look for while they are open. 
&gt;Thanks
