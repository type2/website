&gt; You can be pretty sure that the pump reading is accurate, as they are usually
&gt; calibrated by a weights and measures agency.

&gt; Interesting, I'd heard they were up to 10% off...  there was a recent discussion
&gt; on the Type 3 list about this, it came about because of a few people putting
&gt; 11 gallons into their 10 gallon tanks.

I can only speak for California, but their pumps are calibrated by filling
a precision gas can.  The tolerance is 0.1% or one part in 1000.

&gt; &gt;&gt;As with all measurements, your accuracy goes up with increased quantity,
&gt; so go most of the way through the tank.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; Wow, my tape measure measure 2' more accurately than 1' ?

Yes.  Let's say that your tape measures to the nearest 1/8 inch.  If you
measure 1 foot with this measure, your accuracy is 1.04%.  If you measure
2 feet with this same measure, your accuracy is 0.52%
