&gt; Hello All,
&gt; Can ANYONE shed some light on NEATO/LIMBO.....
&gt; I have sent my money and my application over a month ago,and have not heard
&gt; a thing back.....When I called I just got a recording that &quot;this number is
&gt; NO LONGER in service&quot;.....Are they still around???
&gt; or have they gone by way of SOTO(Taking your cash,and well you know the rest)
&gt; Jim

Dave Easterwood in Georgia took the reins of NEATO/OBR editor about a
year ago and has done a smashing good job of it. He has gotten the
issues caught up, and is now on a bi-monthly schedule. One is due
soon...
LiMBO is overdue, but has been very regular for the last several years I
have beem getting it. 

Who did you send money to? LiMBO and NEATO are seperate clubs, although
they do co-produce the TTT directory.
