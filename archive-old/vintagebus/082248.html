If volkswagen would sell a new version of the microbus here in the us,  
I would highly consider buying one.  I think they are crazy for not 
considering trying it over here.   There are several types of people 
that volkswagen could market them to over here&quot;
    People who like the old bus years ago, and would consider having 
one  for nostalgia
    People who like volkswagens and know them for their dependability 
but hate the looks of the Eurovan
    People who buy types of vehicles like the Scion (built by toyota and 
marked to younger people)
    Anyone who wanted a nice looking mini van for any purpose.

Volkswagen has lost their mind once again. 


Just my thoughts
