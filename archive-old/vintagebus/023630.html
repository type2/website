&lt;&lt; If there is an additive package for GL5 which harms early trannies, then
 how could that oil be rated for GL4?
  I'm thinking that perhaps Valvoline has come up with an additive package
 which can meet BOTH performance standards.  Isn't this a possibility?  &gt;&gt;
Hi Cabayo,
Anything is possible, but until you know for sure are you ready to risk a 
$500.00 tranny rebuild, and removal/installation cost of time or money to 
have this done?
