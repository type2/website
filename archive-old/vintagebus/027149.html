&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; I was cruzing through e-bay today, and noticed that different people are
&gt; labeling two different items with the same label.  Yes, i know to expect
&gt; that, but what I was wondering, is with regard to the 58-61 tailights,
&gt; why do some have screw terminals and other have slip on terminals.  I
&gt; have a '59 and the fuse box is all screw terminals, so why would there
&gt; be slip ons for the same set of years.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Aaron

VW had screw on terminals for their electrical connections up to '60. After
that they went to the slip on style. SOOOOOO......... those '61 tail lights
would be one year only!!!! and super rare!!! (only on ebay though) 8-)
