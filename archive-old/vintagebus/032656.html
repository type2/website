 hey, i'm using jon's account to send an email to you good folks.  today
was totally crazy and i wanted ever so much to share what had happened with
folks that'd understand.  jon and i went to a fellow enthusiast's shop to
look at all his cool tools, parts and volkswagens.  rick surprised us with
his newly purchased right-hand drive double door barndoor panel.  he asked
us if we wanted to go for a ride and i just looked dumb for a second before
i took off to the passenger's side and hopped in.  rick drove us down the
block and back and i was so happy holding on to the wheelie grab handle and
watching rick shift until he pulled up along the curb outside the shop, set
the parking brake, got out and told us to drive it around.  i was really
scared, i mean i've only driven three barndoors (everett's was my first two
jeromes ago) and i've never driven a right-hand drive.  jon told me to
slide over and stop being such a wuss.  i did and it was freakin' great! 
that bus has all kinds of power and acceleration and it drove very smoothly
and comfortably.  yet again i was favorably impressed with the performance
a 36-horse engine can put out.  i only made a bad sound one while shifting
from second to third and when jon drove he did so perfectly!  perhaps now
that rick has trusted both jon and i to drive his new baby, mercury bus
will be trusted to me for a trip around the block as it has been to jon. 
we brought the double door back to the shop and raved about it.  rick was
all smiles, eating up the compliments and you could tell he loves his new
bus.  we stayed there for half the day looking around the shop, checking
out the tools and parts and talking.  jon noticed that the headlight bezels
in the double door were beetle, so rick looked through his parts and asked
which set of n.o.s. light units should he use - hella or bosch... must be
nice!  today was a really great day!  i got to drive a right hand drive
vehicle and it was a double door barndoor!  i got to help &quot;work&quot; on it and
had hours of fun vw-related conversation!  by the way, i'll be signing back
on the list as soon as i get back from my weeklong law librarian trip to
minneapolis.
 
 cheers,
