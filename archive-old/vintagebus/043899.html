Subject: How to raise my 62 standard?

Hi Listees,
	Harry Houck recently had a shin-dig to welcome a '65 21 window to
his family. While there enjoying his hospitality and very tasty homebrew,
I learned from he and Karl (who is also from the list) the whereabouts of
a '62. Although it sounds like it is pretty much stripped (including a
LARGE drivers side clip that Harry has taken possesion of) it still has
its drivetrain. 
	Harry's heart was full of kindness (or was it just homebrew?) and
he graciously gave up his &quot;I saw it first&quot; claim. Which is good, because
it saves me the trouble of relentless seaching out the bus in order to
steal it out from under him! Just kidding, I would never sink that low
except maybe for those Gen-U-wine German safaris he has stashed in a
super-secret-hidding place ;) 

	So my questions are: what are ALL the pieces I need off this bus
to bring mine back to stock? Are there any odd tools that I will need? How
hard is it to take out the front beam?
	Right now my '62 has the rearend out of a '68 T3 (I think that's
what the DPO said) 
	For those that have been asking about lowering their splits, when
I get this finished I will have the T3 rearend, a set of Porsche Fuchs,
wide 5 wheel adapters, and possibly the front beam for sale. All the stuff
you need to lower your bus and look sano...just make sure you keep your
stock peices, or give them to a good home (I wish my P.O. had).

TIA
Todd (who doesn't want the Buick that's FS)
'62 standard
