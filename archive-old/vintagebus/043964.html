&gt; In areas with moderate amounts of the extremely abrasive ash a set of
&gt; pantyhose, folded many times and secured over the air cleaner intake with
&gt; rubber bands, duct tape, wire, etc. gave excellent protection.  Many
&gt; drivers got into the routine of removing the &quot;pantyhose prefilter&quot; at
&gt; each stop and replacing it with a fresh setup.  At minimum they carefully
&gt; shook out the accumulated ash and reinstalled the pantyhose with the
&gt; clean side inside.
