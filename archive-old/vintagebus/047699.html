Valves do not go much out of adjustment on a normally running motor.   maybe 
have to adjust a few just a tad.   If the motor is breaking in from new, or 
the rocker arms have been off for some reason (such as retorquing the heads, 
or replacing a cracked push rod tube with a two part one which means push 
rods ust come out) the valves will go out of adjust mean as things set 
together.   If your motor got hot, they tend to get tight.

what is the knocking problems like?  If you rev the motor and let your foot 
of the gas do you hear it distinctly more like a rattlesnake about to strike, 
but not really hear it as you rev, but definately more of the decel ?  That 
signifies a rod knock, which means DO NOT DRIVE!!!    
then again, an exhaust leak can make a knocking sound.  let your bus idle, go 
around to the motor and feel around wher ethe heater boxes and muffler meet.  
air should not blow out from there.  Air will blow out from around the 
cylinder, and the under neath tin will aim the air flow to wards you when you 
are behind the motor, so ignore that and feel around the joint of the exhaust 
system.   and if you have a stock muffler, at the tailpipe etc connection.   
do you have a hole somewhere.   I know someone driving around with a hole in 
a heater box .  not a big one, but enough to make a noise.  I use that 
coppery high temp goo with the donuts.  seems to help.

you've read the idiot book procedure?   it is pretty good but me myself I had 
a real hard time visualising it - and the first time i did a top end rebuild 
I had help/ was walked through it.  any one locally who you could get to do 
that?

no you are not naive- you can do it if you can pull a motor.

 I was SUPPOSED to get to my engine knocking problem Sat. but of course put
 it off. So I'm finally just about to go out and check the valve adjustment.
 I was wondering if there would be any reason that the valves would suddenly
 go out of adjustment? I figure any reason isn't good. Thought I'd see what
 you all have to say about that.
 
 More than likely I will have to pull the engine and tear it down to some
 degree. I've pulled and put an engine in before, so I'm not too worried
 about that. But I have NEVER tore into an engine. I've got the engine
 rebuild book and have kept it at my work to read while I'm in the &quot;throne
 room&quot; (you guys know where I'm talking about). It's helped me a little to
 kind of understand and engine and what goes into rebuilding it. But like I
 said before, I've got absolutely NO hands on experience. I'm a little
 concerned about doing anything, but can't afford to take it somewhere and
 have it done. The engine was running perfectly fine before the knocking
 began. And it really seems to be fine still. So I thought I'd go at it
 looking to find and fix the knock. Am I a little nieve thinking I can do
 this myself and that I can just fix the problem and put it back together?
 
 I'm very nervous, but also poor. The poor part always encourages me to try
 things myself. Usually will take me a while to get things done. But I come
 out of it OK. So what do you guys think?
