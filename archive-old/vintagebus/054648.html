Subject: RE: [VB] Adjusting a H30/31 pict carb

You are also putting a bigger load on the engine, thus creating more heat.  

You know all this VW overheating talk has always had me wondering, why does
a Porsche 356 engine run so cool? They have the same style oil cooler as a
VW, in the shroud, 36 HP style shroud, they do have bigger heads and an oil
filter, duel carbs etc. When I use to drive my 356 (1960) to Havasu from
Cali, I would cruise at 80-90 mph in 100 degree plus heat and my oil temp
never would go above 210. The 356 has a smaller crank pully then a VW and
the cooling fan is the same as a 36 hp engine, kust makes me wonder. I think
I'll see if I can fit some 356 heads to a VW case.

ps. The pre A Porsches  engine case was the same as a 36 hp VW

This heating problem is still with us when the outside temp. is above
85. We are running a 6 volt small generator pulley to help turn the fan
about 2.1 to 1 (stock is 1.6 to 1). This helps in cooling it down faster
(as required), when you idle and we do get better heating when we use
the heater.
We also have type 4 dog house cooler.
Maybe it is an ez camper problem (LOL) who knows?
We do run 47 to 53 mph to help kept temp down.
This summer we did not have a temp problem running around the north west
USA
Ours carb. is a new 'Brog'  pic 30 type we did increase our mileage with
this new carb but have not played with the jetting yet, so please share
if you find anything.
PS Rhone thinks we are wasting HP by turning the fan faster and we are
sure it does some.
