&gt; How forgiving is the gasket in filling these kind of areas if there is only

The gasket is not the 'forgiving' part. It's the combination fit created
by the gasket and the lip of the window opening. The lip needs to be as
smooth and as uniform as possible - the same dimensions as unrusted
healthy lip. The frame area below the lip should have no holes and be
smooth. If you discover missing material, and you aren't able to get it
welded at this time, then do what you can with assorted tube stuff, to
recreate a proper lip and frame area for the seal. This probably means:

wire-wheel the rust away. Then rust-removing gel, then a thorough washing,
then a pat it with laquer thinner just before applying the metal
conditioner (phosphoric acid stuff), then water rinse, dry, then apply a
body filler. Sand and shape, then a zinc-rich primer or that
self-etching epoxy primer, then several layers of a
sandable primer, sand and smooth out, then another primer or sealer layer,
then your top-coat. I sound like a doctor!

You could also just minimize the rust, apply POR15, wait two hours til
tacky, spray a light coat of primer (vital!), let dry, then apply filler,
shape, sand, primer, and top-coat.

There are probably other ways too. But that'll give you an idea of what
you can do. You want to minimize further rusting and prevent leaks.
Professional glass installers will use some kind of clear sealing goop
during the installation, to guarantee no leaks.

good luck!
