First off, HERE HERE!! to Curtis for expressing the machismo of the
&quot;insanity&quot; theory so well... he's right, insane was a little harsh a term.

Second, let me be the first to stand up and proudly exclaim, &quot;I am a GEEK&quot;
I am a big, dumb nerdy bus GEEK!!

I drive deluxes in immanent danger of breaking in half, I drive busses
cross-country with a bungee cord to hold in in 4th gear, I drive a hatch-top
Westy on vacation, get Bronchitis 2 days into the trip, and KEEP ON TRUCKIN.

Not only am I a bus geek, but I'm even a (shudder) Trekkie, X-Phile,
computer nerd, and photography hound.

I am the craziest of them all! I bought a house nearly sight-unseen just
because it had a 1,600 sq.ft. garage.  (Went like this:  While standing
slack-jawed in the garage &quot;Does the toilet in the house work?&quot; Owner: &quot;yes&quot;
Me: &quot;I'll take it&quot;).

I love women. I love women in V-Dubs even better.  I have had several &quot;VW
Enthusiast&quot; girlfriends. They were all crazy.  Most of the others I have met
were crazy.  Only in a way not so compatible with my craziness.  (perhaps
because they drove late-models?  who knows. who cares?)

Am I frustrated as Curt has postulated?  Hell yes! Why? Well maybe because
myself and many others have been on one-too-many 1st dates where you pull up
in your pride and joy underpowered, rusty, hot, smelly Bulli only to hear
&quot;We're going out in THAT?&quot;  Sorry gals, end of date for me. Not because they
don't like my bus, but rather because it is a symptom of a mindset I am
completely incompatible with.

This whole thing was meant only as a lighthearted post to take the edge off
the barrage of abrasive Hoover bashes. I can see now it has turned into an
animal.  I do enjoy the deeper philosophical discussion though, perhaps best
kept off-list.  I have a feeling I've touched a nerve.  This whole thing is
turning too serious for my taste.

As far as Women in busses go...  Keep on Bussin'!!  I will lust after you
from afar. And, perhaps in a brief lapse of reason I will peruse a
relationship.  But the fact is the odds are not in our favor for BOTH
PARTIES.

In the meantime, I shall strive to be the best bus Geek that I possibly can
:-)

PS.  When Curt says that T3 chicks RULE, he only sez that because his has
mammaries as big as a grown mans head ;-)  lol   love ya curt!

What to say to somebody who doesn't appreciate your Vintage VW  &quot;In ten
years, my car will still be a classic, yours will just be OLD.&quot;

Or my current favorite: &quot;Does YOUR car have a sink?&quot;
