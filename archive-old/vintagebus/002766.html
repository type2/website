Subject: Rear Axle Seal O-rings
Date: Sun, 30 Jul 2000 23:30:34 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I have a rear axle seal kit and within that kit are two gaskets, a washer,
an oil seal, and  2 O-rings - where does the bigger O-ring go in my 60.
Neither side had the large O-ring and I don't see one in the bently, though
I'll recheck.

TIA
