 I metered the wire from the flasher to the dash TS
 light.  It is providing a constant +12V when
 everythign is off.  I also checked the #15 wire from
 the ignition to the dash pod. It is at +.3V when the
 key is off and +12V when it is on.  With the key off,
 and the TS light on the dash on i can pull the bulb
 and the light goes off. &gt;&gt;

and with that TS dash bulb removed and the key on, do the outside lights work?

when the key goes on the 15 term black wire gets power, which is power for 
dash warning lights etc, and may be connected wrong (it cand be real tricky 
to see under there)
