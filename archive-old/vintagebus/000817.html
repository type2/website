Here goes nothing, I've been watching this for several days, amazed at the 
depths people go to. Dawn of PLF has moved as several people have mentioned. 
That alone has pushed orders back several weeks.
How many you bashers know her son was hurt (ie broken hand/arm) that required 
surgery????
Personally, I have been waiting for 4 months for a one off Westy tent, that I 
talked her into producing for a very special customer of mine. That is 4 
months, not three weeks. 
Give her a _at_#$% break. If you don't have something after 4 months than come 
talk to me. I'll show you what it takes to produce quality resto parts, 
interiors and complete restorations. None of the above happen over night, esp 
when you move or have family problems. 
Dawn will come through, I'll stake my reputation on that one.
