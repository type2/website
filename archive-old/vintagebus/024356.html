And it was writ:
&gt; thou I must admit I've had fun air 
&gt; brushing speedo faces. 
&gt; Another one of my strange hobbies :) 
&gt; Peace, Love, and this speedo tampering 
&gt; is probably against the law-so you 
&gt; didn't hear this stuff from me. 
&gt; Mr. Bubble Head 

Most of you have seen pictures on the
net of the black 23 window deluxe with
the surf sunset mural on the side.  I've
seen this bus off and on for about 10
years in the Sacramento/Roseville/Auburn
area.  Kept hoping to check in with
the owner to spout the gospel of
vintagebus, amen!

I finally found the owner at an upholstery 
shop a couple of months ago and had a chance
to chat a little.  What the rest of you 
DON'T know is that the gas guage, speedo,
and clock are also painted with a mural
in the same style.  Very cool job.  Needs
some interior work.  Not interested in 
selling it, so don't ask.


While tampering with a speedo may be 
technically a no-no, nobody is going
to hassle you for messing with a speedo
on a 30 year old bus.  I fessed up to the
California DMV that the speedo in my
'80 Westi had been repaired and showed
about 40K less than reality.  It had about
210K on it showing.  There is
a form to fill out if the speedo doesn't
match the real mileage.  The answer
was that &quot;if the vehicle has over 100K,
you don't need fill out the form&quot;
