Don't want to take any wind out of Jerome, not that one could, but I was wondering if any listmembers will be attending the Solvang Veterantreffen next month?  Solvang, California is located in the picturesque Santa Ynez Valley just north of Santa Barbara.  I think I can make this one, it's only a 45 minute drive for me.

Anyone have any details on this?  If not, I can snoop around here and get info posted if people are interested.
