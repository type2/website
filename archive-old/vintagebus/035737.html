Hi Gene,
In the dual circuit MC there is in a wierd way two MCs built into one MC 
body.  The front brakes part of the dual MC is the first to feel the pressure 
of the pedal being pumped so you want to bleed the front brakes first.  This 
makes that part of the MC solid so as to make it possible to fully bleed with 
the brake pedal the rear brakes.
  As to priming we do this when we install a MC but before hooking up the 
metal lines or at least all of these lines.  In single circuit MCs one needs 
only one metal brake line off the MC to do the following proceedure, the dual 
MC needs one metal brake line off each of it's half cylinders (Front, rear.) 
for a total of two metal brake lines.   Fill the resevior with brake fluid.  
Then we have someone push down the brake pedal with another person under the 
bus.  Though a single person laying under the bus can do the same by using 
one hand to pull the brake pedal rod/lever under the floor down with one hand 
and the other to work on the MC.  Once the brake pedal is all the way down 
the person underneath puts thier finger/s over the hole/s which have/has not 
been hooked up yet.  Then the brake pedal is released upward allowing the 
brake fluid to be sucked into the MC from the brake fluid resevior.  this is 
repeated several times till brake fluid comes out of the hole/s in the MC and 
then the last/other metal brake lines are hooked up.  Refill the resevior and 
bleed the rest of the brake system.
