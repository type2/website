I wonder how people figured out that it was Eddie in the first place?  I'd
think that if he just dressed like a typical bus guy (however that is)
he'd blend in just fine.  OTOH, if he had on his metal-rocker outfit and
was trailed by an entourage he'd stick out like a sore thumb!

I have a feeling that he'd get his desired bus a lot easier (and cheaper!) 
if he attended in stealth mode!
