Subject: Another panel question...
Mime-Version: 1.0


Anyone know about interior options for panel buses?  I have a pic of one
with partial interior panels for the cargo area.  I like the idea - makes
it look a lot cleaner inside, and would protect the sides from inside-out
dents.

Also, I want to install some sort of tie-down mounts inside, so I can put
my cycle truck (or whatever) in there and strap it down.  What would be
cool would be to use the same sort of strap mounts as single cabs have.
Any other ideas?

One last thing: do they repro panel bus cargo floor mats?
