Subject: Early distributors

I have just found what I believe to be an early distributor - it does not take
a normal rotor.  It does not appear to have any markings on the body  -
however there are markings on the vac can and on the points place.  It does
have a thick layer of paint on it so it could be I need to scratch it off.
Any ideas of where I should scratch?
It has a hole in the bottom with a gauze in it if that helps at all?

Thanks
Paul
