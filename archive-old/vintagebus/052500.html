Subject: Re: [VB] 6 volt to 12 volt

&gt;Anyone have any ideas as how I can set up a 6 volt Southwind Heater to a
&gt;12 volt bus?

Sure.  Just replace all the blower motors, the ignition coil, and the
fuel pump/solenoid (if equipped) with 12 volt versions.  What?  You
don't have this stuff lying around?  OK, here is the answer you probably 
really wanted:

Just putting a resistor in the main power line to the heater will work
kind of OK but not great.  According to the wiring diagrams for
Southwind heaters at http://vw.itgo_dot_com/heater.html , they seem to have
combustion and vent blowers that go all the time, and ignition coils
and output blowers that only go when the thermostat cycles on.  This
means that the electrical load presented by the heater will change as
the thermostat cycles, which a simple resistor can't deal with - when
the ignition coil is on your heater might have 4 volts across it, and
when the ignition coil is off the heater might have 8 volts across it!
As the manual notes, 6 volt heaters draw from 11 to 14 amps and 12 volt
ones draw from 8 to 10 amps.

There are a couple of ways around this.  One would be to install one
resistor for the parts of the heater that run all the time, and another
for the parts of the heater that cycle with the thermostat.  This would
require some re-wiring but would probably be the simplest thing to do
Another way would be to install a solid state voltage regulator, which
can deal much better with changing load currents.  The problem with this
is that it's kind of hard to find a single regulator that could do
14 A _at_ 6 V.  You could find regulators rated for less current and put
a regulator on each current-consuming item.

I can't tell from a quick look whether the relay on the diagrams is
just a regular relay or incorporates a time switch etc.  If it's a
simple relay then changing it out for a 12 volt unit might be best;
if it's fancy then you need to keep it and run it on a resistor or
a voltage regulator.

I hope this helps!
