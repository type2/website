There is some fault with this logic
at the equator there is only (very) approxmately 50% land mass so one
only needs to drive one half the miles to get around the world unless
you have to drive the bus all the time on the ferry boats to power them
Therefore you can double the number of times you go around the world
or save the fuel for the next VW meet

&gt; Assuming you could restore a Bus for $6,000, you have saved
&gt; $5,780 over the cost of a new Echo.  (Obviously it doesn't make
&gt; any sense to buy a Prius).  Assuming that you can buy gas
&gt; everywhere in the world for the US price of $2/gal, that buys
&gt; you 2,890 gallons of gas, which at 20 mpg would take you 57,800
&gt; miles.  At the equator, this is only about 2.31 times around
&gt; the world.  At European prices of $4/gal you only get 28,900
&gt; miles, or 1.15 times around the world.  This also assumes that
&gt; you sleep in the Bus and that the boat passage you will need
&gt; to do this is free.  :)
