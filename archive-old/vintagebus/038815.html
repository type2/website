Your problem is similar to one that I have had only more excessive.  The key
to your oil consumption seems to be directly coorelated to the angle that
your engine is tilted and which way the oil is sloshed about.  In my 66
1300cc beetle sometimes if I park on the left side of the street (on
pavement with a pronounced road crown) I would get blue smoke when I started
the engine.  I was getting no other oil consumption problems and I would not
even use oil on 70+mph cruises to Wisconsin.  After some head scratching I
finally figured out that the oil-control rings on one of the left bank
pistons could be to blame.  I think that the gap of the ring was on the
bottom of the piston, allowing the oil to slowly ooze by when parked.  The
problem seemed to fix itself so I will never know if my theory is correct.
I think that a stock 1300 engine that runs over 75mph and burns no oil
should not be ripped apart for this idiosyncracy anyhow.  Could this be at
least part of your problem???

After solving the carb problems I decided new plugs were in order as
well as an oil change. I had put 20-50w in after I rebuilt the carb
and the motor was leaking quite a bit more than usual. The motor was
also putting out a blue cloud when I started it up in the morning
which for whatever reason coincided with the switch to 20-50w. When
the plugs came out the ones form the right side head were brown and
ones from the left side were grayish black. New Bosch plugs went in
and a fresh batch of Castrol 30w.

AFAIK the motor has been in the bus since 1979 when Judy bought it.
It has pushed the bus around for over 70,000 miles on it and who know
what it had before since it came out of an early 70s beetle.

Work on the bus went well and I even tightened up the new muffler and
cured the slight exhaust leak. Tools went back in the bus, washed up
and went for the customary victory lap. About a mile down the road I
took a sharp left turn onto a side street and a HUGE blue cloud was
left in my wake. UUUGGGHHHH. The smoke seemed to stop. A mile later I
took and hard left into the neighborhood and again a another lengthy
trail of blue smoke-this one worse! The blue cloud is intermittent
and did not occur at idle. Oil light never came on.

Aside from the obvious burning of oil the motor sounded great and had
good power. I coasted into the driveway as the motor was shut of just
in case. I checked the motor and found nothing. Fired it back up and
did a few runs through the neighborhood. The blue smoke appeared
under load up a hill and around corners. Otherwise runs good. Motor
is not overheating.

Another visual inspection. This time the tail pipe caught my eye.
There is oil in the tailpipe and it seems to be a fair amount. I
stuffed a rag in it and it came out black with oil. I checked the oil
level and it was at the high mark on the dipstick. I may have put an
extra cup in when  I filled it up.

A compression check is in order but I do not have a gauge handy. I am
guessing a ring has gone bad. John suggested a cracked or holed
piston. Any happy ideas? Is there any chance this is the result of
putting a little too much oil in and hitting turns  hard or going up
hills is sloshing oil around in the muffler?

UUUGGGHHHH!!!!!!
This has been a real Charlie Brown week :)
