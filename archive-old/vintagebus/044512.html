Yes, this popping out will happen with a 6V wiper on a 12V system,   It is 
not designed for that speed.   I suggest a voltage drop, easy and cheap, less 
hassle than swapping motors, no denting of defrost ducts needed.

You could even try JPs interesting system of using a switch which will allow 
you 3 speeds.

&lt;&lt; I know why the problem happened....the driver's side rod came out of its
 socket (it just needed tightening) and then fouled the passenger side rod,
 and popped it out....I was able to pop it all back together and torque down
 the set screw for the driver's side rod. &gt;&gt;
