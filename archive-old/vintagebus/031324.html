Hey Mike and list,

I'm just curious on opinion here, but if a LHD LHside door splitty is only
Uncommon, than what actually classifies as rare?  A Binz, a double door
deluxe, these are discussed every other day on this list, how about the ever
elusive '54 &quot;Jack a lop&quot;... I mean Binz, that has somehow still to this day
evaded a camera.  Side loader? Drakula? Ambulance? Cherry Picker, Scott
McWilliams Lunch Wagon or Zebra bus.  I'm confused, I live in Southern
California, and have only seen one LHD LHside bus at the OCTO show February
of this year.  Maybe it's uncommon world wide, but here where busses
supposedly grow on trees, a daily splitty sighting is rare, ok maybe only
uncommon, but non the less, I consider my '59 23 window with semaphores
rare.  I've only seen one other one.  So what is rare?

Mike, hope i didn't offend, that wasn't my intention, just questioning your
statement.  And also asking for an idea of scale?

&gt; We need to set a scale when someone says &quot;really

&gt; uncommon.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; ya- they made them - but they are really rare,
&gt; &gt; especially in the USA.  I have
&gt; &gt; seen a LHD LHside door splitty- that was wierd
