&gt; Although i replaced the rocker on my binz and it had the inner strengthner, but it also had belly

&gt; strengthner. 

This makes total sense.  Your Binz was made out of a SC right?  I bet
all SCs have strengthend rockers just like every other bus that is &quot;full
length&quot;. I don't think the belly pans had anything to do with it. Just a thought.
