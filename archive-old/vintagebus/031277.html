Those shots are just teasers...you haven't seen the really cool stuff.  That
is one awesome ride.  Anyone want to make a bet as to if it makes the cover
of HVW's or not?

&gt; Oh my gawd, the purple primer theft mystery!!!
&gt; Wow! now you have to live with what looks like an
&gt; excellent project. Good for you. ;-)
&gt;
&gt; It's a darned good thing that I was one of the very
&gt; few who were *totally* in favor of the Double Door
&gt; Barndoor Deluxe Panel project. I'm all in favor of
&gt; customizing and doing it your way. F those vintage
&gt; nerds anyways! There is way too much of the cookie
&gt; cutter same old same old.
