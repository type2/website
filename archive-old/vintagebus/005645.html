Hey Everyone,

I'm trying to find a good parts vendor on the east coast for my 1955 Single.
Currently I need all the front brake parts re: shoes, cylinders, and
hoses.... I thought my local shop had a good source for these, but after
waiting a week, I called them and was informed they were to call their
supplier in 7-10 days to see if these parts were available. If I had known
the shop was going to take so long, I would have just ordered the parts from
Wolfsburg West and had them by now... Anyways, before I order the parts
tomorrow from WW, I thought I'd ask the list of a possible east coast
source. Thanks,

Tom
