I have a '61 double cab..totally stock in all respects...tires/redux
boxes/motor/carb/dizzy/exhaust etc. and at 60 it sounds as tho I'm doing
90.  I might could go faster but I tend to &quot;listen&quot; to the truck and only
push it to what feels comfortable.
I have years of driving experience in air cooled VeeDubs...and still find
that being a bit conservative with these old things will perhaps increase
the life of my wallet!
later

&gt; (WOT!) going 60mph.  36 HP here sounds about right too for this
