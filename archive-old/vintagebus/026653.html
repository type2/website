Subject: Greenville SC area Bussers

This will be the last post I make for this event...

Saturday, January 8, we are trying to get all the local bus folk
together at Denny's (Wade Hampton Blvd. in Taylors). 

We don't really have any plans other than to see how many bussers show
up, and swapping some names and numbers. If there is enough interest, we
will get a local bus club going with regular get-togethers...

If you know anyone in the area who is not a listee, please let them know
so they can be there. 

Also, Michael McGinn and I are trying to get a rough estimate of how
many folks may be there so we can reserve some tables, so please p-mail
me if you are interested, and let me know of others that plan to
attend...

Thanks for the bandwidth...

david
