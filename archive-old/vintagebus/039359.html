i also remembered the words of a
&gt;mechanic from the shop i worked at, and a long-time philosophy of mine: vw
&gt;spent countless dollars (d marks) engineering, designing, and deciding what
&gt;things a user of one of their cars needed in order to be notified of any
&gt;troubles and came up with this result--2 idiot lights.

Or do you think VW spent VERY LITTLE on this and rather realized that their 
engines were tough enough to deal with MOST situations and did not want to 
spend money on accessories to tell you whats going on? THEY WANTED TO SAVE 
MONEY.

Now days we are running used engines, rebuilt parts, aftermarket stuff, 
crazy to intersting engine designs ETC. You do not have a factory car, most 
likely, YOU are the tech. Do you want to know whats happening or not?

BTW. In your favor: My friends still give me crap that I used to just drive 
the Dam Bus and not worry, Now with guages I worry and and fret over it.

And still the tranny goes out, the brakes need changing, valves need 
adjusting ETC.

Oh well
Jason
