Wow, I'm not sure what to say...  I guess you told me...

&gt;This mailing list lives in fear.

I'm not afraid.  But just because *you* are paranoid does not
necessarily mean everyone is not out to get you.

&gt;F**k tact, love that?  Truth is what matters, not being 
&gt;friendly.  Oh my god, I bet that value isn't something you 
&gt;want to see someone say.

*Now* I am scared.  &quot;The TRUTH is out there, Mulder&quot;.

&gt;You don't like my archive interface?  Why don't you get the 
&gt;data and make your own...

You understand what &quot;no offense&quot; means?  I did not find the 
interface intuitive, but I appreciate the work that went 
into it.  I also appreciate the work to maintain it.

&gt;Don't let the logic upset you.  I'm just one person, I should 
&gt;be ignored,

10-4, Good Buddy.

Lighten up &amp; relax.
