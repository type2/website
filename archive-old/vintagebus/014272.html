Hi, got a beater `59 kombi gonna use as a swap
bus...tailights hacked out...NOT lookin for 100%
correct lights just something cool, really little and
cheap...

anyone got any `50-`57's??? beat-up ones, mismatched,
cracked lenses..whatever....the cheaper the
better...not picky...this is gonna be a rat bus...cool
hi-little beat t-lights will work.

I have some cool trades stuff too...let me know ahat
ya got.....there has to be lots of leftover beater
t-lights from all those primo restos out there...

Again I can find nice expensive ones...I need CHEAP!

Thanks
Todd
