Subject: More Carbs: electromagnetic cut-off jet and Muir

I was browsing through the Muir Idiot manual and found that he eliminated his electromagnetic cut-off jet.  Muir claims that VW sold a screw in jet to take its place.  Does anyone know what this PN# is or where to order one?

The downside is that the engine will run on a few seconds after you turn it off (kind of like dieseling).  No big deal.

I have a phobia of battery/generator death and want the car to run without need of power...  Just in case.  I wondered why my buddies '71 with generator cut off when the battery died.  I always thought that the generator motor would run without power, this is not the case unless you have the pre-PICT carbs or get rid of this cut-off jet.

BTW: I will stray from Muir and keep my auto-choke though :)

Thanks,
