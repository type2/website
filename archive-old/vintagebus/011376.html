Subject: Cleaning fuel tank, rebuilding reserve tap
Date: Thu, 25 Jun 1998 22:26:39 -0500

In rebuilding my 1960 panel one of my first tasks was to remove the gas
tank (the car had been in a field with no tank lid or filler door for about
11 years) to clean it.  I have run three cans of carb cleaner type solvent
mixed with a gallon of gas, and things seem better.  I am going to also try
the magnet trick I read earlier.

Question 1.  Any other suggestions on cleaning the tank before I put it
back and go for a ride?

Question 2.  I discovered that the metal parts of the reserve tap are in
good shape, but there were no seals.  I found an O-ring that seems to fit
in a space inside the valve, and seems to make a tight seal.  Is this a
correct assumption as to sealing the thing?

Question 3.  It also seems to have a place for a dust seal on the outside.
Any suggestions on where to get one, or what to use as a substitute?

Question 4.  Would I be smarter to find a new one?  Are they available?

Thanks
Bill Cobabe
