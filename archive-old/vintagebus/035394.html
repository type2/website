Subject: Re:  [VB] M-code question
To: Ronnie_at_oldvolks_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

there are several M codes that I have not found listed anywhere, but I 
decided mean US specs.  The code in question changed over the years.   I dont 
know if Thom found them in the VW literture somewhere or what, or just agreed 
that's what they seemed to be.   SOme of the earlier codes are  used in 
combination with 175, and the later ones dont have that separately.       

SO yes, it seems that 175 was included in the mid 60 US spec package M code, 
which was something other than 360, think 470 or something.    odd that his 
has 175 and yours its in the package, but think of it as figuring out a new 
code after overriders were introduced in 1959.

Dave E I think has the NEATO survey of M codes- and could surely say when 175 
stopped being there with the other code, or isn't the vintagebus survey set 
up so you could check tha too?

=  == = = == = 
Matt and I both have 1960 DD panels here in Havasu, his was built 30,000

before mine. We both have M-code 360 (U S spec according to Thom's site),

but his has M-code 175 also (overrider bumpers) but mine doesn't and it came

with over rider bumpers. So the question is? Did VW include override bumpers

as a standard item in the late 60's as part of the U S spec package? or

could the over rider bumpers on mine just have been added later?  What were

the M-codes on the 2 60 DD's you found Thom?
