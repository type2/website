&gt; Hoping someone might be able to provide some insight to an electrical
&gt; problem I've created for myself. Here's the background:
&gt;
&gt; I just had my engine rebuilt by Jack Staggs (it's great!) and converted
&gt; the entire car to 12V at the same time. I used the small diameter 912
&gt; 12V generator, new Optima battery, etc... pretty standard stuff... It
&gt; ran great and the battery charged fine for about 1000 miles, and then I
&gt; started messing with things.
&gt;
&gt; I added a stereo amplifier and upgraded my headlights to 55W/100W and
&gt; driving lights to 80W. I assumed that this would be too much for the
&gt; generator (which I believe is rated at 30 amps), but I thought I'd see
&gt; just how bad it is, and then upgrade once I had everything working.

Well, if you're driving about with all systems ablaze you will overwhelm a
30A generator

&gt; Well, after about 50 miles of use, it seems I &quot;overstressed&quot; the
&gt; electrical system and something broke. The generator light is on and the
&gt; battery no longer charges. The belt/etc is still fine. So, my questions:
&gt;
&gt; 1. Can I (did I) damage components by trying to pull too many amps? I.e.
&gt; Can one &quot;burn out&quot; the generator by asking too much of it? I just
&gt; thought my headlights would be dim...

Supposedly, no. You will run your battery down.  However, if there is a
weak component in the generator or regulator you can overstress it to
failure.

&gt; 2. I found a company (Ace Alternator; http://www.acealternator_dot_com/home)
&gt; that claims to be able to upgrade this generator to about 80 amps. Does
&gt; anyone have any experience with this?

I'm leery of &quot;upgrades&quot; of this type.  What happens a few years down the
road when your generator needs service and the company that modified it is
long gone?

&gt; 3. If I upgrade the generator to higher output, do other components need
&gt; to be upgraded as well? Voltage regulator? Anything else?

Yes, they work together.

&gt; 4. (bonus question) I'm just curious, what's the difference between an
&gt; alternator and generator? What do I have? Everything 914 is
&gt; &quot;alternator&quot;, everything 356 seems to be &quot;generator&quot;.

An alternator produces alternating current and uses diodes (one way
electrical valves) to convert the AC to DC to charge your battery.  A
generator uses a heavy-duty commutator to switch the current.  Alternators
are lighter and, since the current comes from the outside coils, there is
no need to pass large currents through the commutator.

Question:  Why not use a late model VW alternator?  They're readily
available, very reliable, and will produce enough amperage to meet your
needs.  It may not be completely &quot;stock appearing&quot;, but if you aren't
going to Pebble Beach the result might be just what you are looking for.
