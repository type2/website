Subject: Relay for novelty horn

Started working on my '59 bus again after taking a month or so off. Fired
it up with the new muffler and tailpipe. Smoked for a minute then ran nice,
clean, and smooth. I'm real proud. It's amazing what a little tuning up can
do for an engine. I think I might actually be able to get by with this
engine for a while. It SEEMS to be running pretty good. I'll enjoy each day
I get to use it, rather than worry about it dying :)

I slapped my barefoot gas pedal accessory on. Really seems to fit the
character of the bus.

I've got one of those &quot;OOH-GA&quot; horns. The install directions show a relay,
but the horn didn't come with one. Anyone have any idea what I should
look/ask for at my FLAPS?

All I gotta do is blast my bumpers and wheels, do a little work on the
screw holes for my pop-out windows, then paint my bumpers, wheels, window
frames, and steering wheel. After that, put everything that's left back on
the bus, change my fluids, and I can start driving while I'm finishing my
interior. So close, but so far away!
