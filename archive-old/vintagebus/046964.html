matter
 what configuration I put them in is this Normal? its about 8 to 10  inch's

Hi Pete,
This seems to be the way the manufactures insure that they do not short
change you on those long door seals.  So trimming them to length is what you
need to do.  We have found that it is best to still cut any rubber seal just
a little long and stuff them into where they belong to avoid the tendancy for
them to shrink lengthwise and leave you with gaps.  Eric&amp;Barb
