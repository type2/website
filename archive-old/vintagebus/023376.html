&lt;&lt;  Did anyone make the US version work on an Euro system? Is it possible or 
do I need to find a Euro one?  &gt;&gt;
Hi Andre,
We installed Euro tail lights on our USA 1963 SC.  All we had to do was to 
disconnect the brake wire from the sender to the signal switch.  Then run a 
single wire directly from the brake sender to the tail lights.    Eric&amp;Barb
