I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THE PLACERVILLE SHOW, BUT THE OTHER TWO WERE GOODGUYS SHOWS
AND THEY PRETTY MUCH HAVE GIVEN UP ON THE VW SHOW CIRCUIT IT SEEMS. KD VW
MOTORSPORTS, A FRIEND AND FELLOW VW ENTHUSIAST HAS TRIED TO PICK UP THE BALL
WITH SHOWS IN MARIN(LAST WEEKEND) AND 2-3 IN VALLEJO, INCLUDING AN INDOOR
SWAPMEET LATE IN THE YEAR. I SPONSOR THESE SHOWS SO I HIT THEM ALL AND I CAN
SAY IF IT WASN'T FOR THE BAD WEATHER THE MAY 2ND SHOW IN VALLEJO WOULD'VE BEEN
ALOT BIGGER, BUT AS IT WAS IT WAS STILL DECENT. THE SHOW IN MARIN LAST WEEKEND
WAS THE BIGGEST WE'VE HAD THERE IN 3 YEARS SO I THINK HE'S GETTING THE JOB
DONE FAIRLY WELL. WHAT IT TAKES TO KEEP IT GOING IS SUPPORT AND ATTENDANCE.
FOR MORE INFO ON UPCOMING SHOWS YOU CAN CALL ME AT MY SHOP 707.837.9029 OR KD
MOTORSPORTS AT 707.995.2480. AS A SIDE NOTE, TREASURE ISLAND HAS BEEN CANCELED
THANKS TO LACK OF HELP/SUPOPORT FROM THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO.
