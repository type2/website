Subject: Mis Fires

Here's a little troubleshooting problem for those
engine experts out 
there.

Problem:
Engine idles perfect, but during acceleration the
engine starts to 
mis-fire
right around 1800rpm and above.

Background of the engine:
1600dp, 009, 34Pict-3, 1000 miles since rebuild,
85-90psi compression 
in all
four cylinders, stock cam, 040 heads, German stock
exhaust, etc...


Seems like those compression numbers are some what
low?? 85-90

what do you think?
