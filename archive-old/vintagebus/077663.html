Subject: Re: [VB] TIME TO BEG FOR A BOLT !!

IMO, he shouldn't care if you drop if off, then spend time nearby at a coffee shop.  Of course, if you have a ways to go, and getting a ride can be inconvenient, that makes the most sense for you.

I can see how he might not want you there while working on it.  It takes about twice as long to do something with someone watching.   It is reasonable for him to ban customers from the work area.

Rare to find a mechanic willing to also be a tutor.  It doesn't pay.

What you want for that is a bus buddy, and be willing to buy pizza &amp; beer.  Look in your local VW clubs, or for people driving old buses.

&gt; you can leave it.&quot;  What's up with that?  Besides, I want to see the work that

&gt; his lap or anything
&gt; .. but I don't want to just leave it and go.
&gt; 
&gt; Am I wrong ?? Am I being unreasonable ??
