Go easy it's my first time.  I've a sweet '65 camper that I just equipped
with a freshly built 1641cc unit but I also want to rejuvinate the tranny so
I'll be ready for springtime exploring.  60 mph is cool with me and I would
not mind getting a rebuilt stock tranny from So-Cal Imports or some such
place but is the conversion to IRS worth the effort or is it like opening a
can of worms.  My reduction gearboxes seem functionally sound and I hate
worms.  Has anyone faced this decision before and care to share their trials
and tribulations?
