Subject: engine transplant? single to dual intake conversion
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I have a '64 bus with a single intake manifold.  This engine is kaput and I 
was wondering what, if any, kind of hassles I will encounter with this 
exchange.  I already have a new 1600 dual port to put into the bus.  Please 
help...  I don't have a car and need to get it fixed ASAP.
