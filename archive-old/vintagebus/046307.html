&lt;&lt;Well right away if it's 7% (I've seen this one) in CA you know it's a scam 
because the sales
tax here is I believe 8.5% or 8.25%. Hell they're not even smart enough to 
get that extra
percent outta someone buy finding out what the actual percent is.
&gt;&gt;

In ventura county its 7.25%.
I think Sacramento is 7.75%
At work here in L.A. its 8.25%
