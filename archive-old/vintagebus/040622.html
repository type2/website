&gt; The best window seals are from WW.
&gt; The WCM are more plastic like and tend to ripple in tight corners.
&gt; On the other hand we have been hearing that WCM makes a better
&gt; (More correct?) set of door seals.


WW makes some of their own splitty seals and buys others from Brazil. RMMW
seems to get virtually all of theirs from Brazil. WCM makes most of their
own splitty seals right here in the U.S., which is why they tend to be
different from the other two.  Since I deal with all of the above, I usually
stock a combination of them depending on availability and customer response.
(Incidentally, the latter seems very inconsistent, by the way.  I have posts
that praised certain seals from one vendor, and others that criticized the
identical seals from another, when both were in fact the identical Brazilian
seal with two different names on them. I think this is due to the fact that
many list members don't have the opportunity to have several specimens of
the same seal in front of them, so they can only comment on the one they
have, with no basis of comparison to others. The same seal someone
criticizes might seem quite nice when compared to the alternatives, or
conversely, the one someone is happy with might pale in comparison to a
competing version that he hasn't seen.)  The one seal that I source from
none of them is my one-piece engine compartment door seal, which I get
directly from Europe (and in my opinion beats both the 4-piece WCM seal and
the one-piece Brazilian one). My European sources make some very fine later
bus seals (best available, in my opinion), but alas, they offer pitifully
little for splitties, since the older busses have become as rare in most of
Europe as they are here in the U.S.
