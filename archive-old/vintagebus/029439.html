    as Thom said.... loosen gen strap and scoot gen forward a bit... readjust
belt tension...
    if that does not fix things... (and you have made sure that you have 8 to
10 shims total with the gen pulley assembly.... the shims *must* be there,
between pulley halves and/or between rear pulley half and spacer, for the
setup to not wiggle and allow looseness...)
    if that does not correct pulley geometry, and the gen pulley is still too
far out... you could remove crank pulley and install a (full or partial...)
sand seal kit... which comes with a spacer that one slides on the end of the
crank into the case, making the crank pulley stand out a bit more from the
case when it is all back together... this requires the use of a longer crank
pulley bolt, which is usually stocked by those who vend the sand seal
kits....

later....

&gt; Additional note:
&gt; We know the pulleys should be aligned BUT....
&gt; Generator pulley is outboard of the the crank pulley.  There is no
&gt; material to be removed on the generator pulley to allow it to go inboard
&gt; anymore.
