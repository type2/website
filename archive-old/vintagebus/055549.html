complete NOS setups that include the spindles, king pins, link pins, needle 
bearings, grease nipples etc.  His ad says they are VW part #'s 211 405 301C 
and 211 405 302C and that they are for chassis # 999305 to 1 144 281.  &gt;&gt;

Hi Don,
Yes, according to the VW bus parts book we have there is a differance.  Yes, 
they will fit onto a 1955-63, but if you are going for a full blown NOS or 
good used resto it will be incorrect.  We do not know what the differance is 
except for the part number, and no they are not part of the M216 suspension.  
How much is the seller asking?  We have several sets of perfectly good used 
ones to sell/trade since we have gone to the later 1964-67 suspensions in our 
1960-63 buses.   Eric&amp;Barb
