WW has some original German mirrors 
http://www.wolfsburgwest_dot_com/cgi-bin/wwshowpn.cgi?PN=211857513gr
only $120.00 a piece.

 There are Izzys repo's also and Flat Fours both around $35.00 a piece. WW,
mine and all the others selling the repop's have the same mirror. The new
style of the cheap repo's are now chromed and have a rubber seal that holds
the mirror in place.

Subject: [VB] A few bus question (65 Samba)


Anyone have any info on the following:

My seatbelts are a bit worse for wear.  Both teh
webbing and the chrome pieces.  Can the webbing be
bought and re-stitched?  anyone have a source?

What are you all using for rear bumper splash pan
seals?

who has the best price on OEM round outside mirrors? 
(Not the repro's, i already have these and am very
unhappy with them)

What have you found works to keep TMI's sun visors (65
padded type) in place.  Mine want to travle down into
my face all the time.  Very irritating.

Anyone have any first hand knowledge with westfalia
tow bars for type 1's.  (email me off list for this
one)  i need some info on compatability for pre 68 and
post 68 units.

thanks for the help.
Matthew
