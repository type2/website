Subject: Re: [VB] A few pictures of buses at the Solvang SHow

Man, did I space.  How come this is the first I heard about this show on
the list??  I didn't do anything this weekend and could have gone.  Crap
:-(  Hope everyone had fun!

BTW Sam, its Robert Davis not Richard 

Steve &quot;wasted the weekend gardening instead of going to a cool VW show&quot; Harris

&gt; Sorry to be so bus centric, there was a fantastic selection of beetles, a
&gt; postal van and a weird front wheel drive truck. But here are a few pictures,
&gt; some in the fog, some in the shine, it was great.
