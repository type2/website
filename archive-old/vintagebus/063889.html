Here's the rest of the story.

Excerpt...

Starting on Oct. 24, 2002, thousands of people received an e-mail in which a
friend or business associate asked them to pick up an &quot;e-card&quot; left for them
at a site called FriendGreetings_dot_com. Those who followed their acquaintances'
supposed instructions discovered they would need to download a program to view
the e-card, and they were presented with standard digital certificate
authentication and installation software to do so. Adding credibility to the
process was the fact that they then had to click OK on two EULAs (End-User
License Agreements) in order to download the viewer software.

We don't know how many people took the time to read both EULAs, but we can be
pretty certain that none who proceeded to click their approval had read the
second one. If they had, they would have seen the bald statement that the
supposedly Panamanian company that owned FriendGreetings_dot_com would be
accessing the licensee's Outlook contact list and sending everyone on that
list a similar invitation to download FriendGreetings.

------------

I suggest you visit www.eudora_dot_com and download their free Outlook
replacement. It's better and less suceptible to virus and such.
