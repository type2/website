      I was wondering if anybody can tell me about any  VW clubs in my
general area. I live in Ottumwa Iowa it is in the south eastern part of
Iowa about an hour from the missouri border. 
   I'm originally from so_dot_cal but have lived here 8 years. In that time
I haven't seen too many aircooled Vws of any make. In fact i nearly give
myself whiplash when i do see one on the road, it's almost like seeing a
ufo. In fact when I told some of my friends I was getting a microbus
they looked at me like I was speaking a foreign language.  I would like
a chance to hook up with some other people if possible with the vw
mindset.

                                            Thanks,

                                                       Shawn
