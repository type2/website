Subject: FW: [VB] Re: [T2] Movie Double Cab &quot;Abusers&quot;

Hello fellow bus folk, I had the oppurtunity to rent my '58 panel out this
last summer.  It was in 'Touched by an Angel'.  Anyone 
see it?  Anywhoo, the only way I felt I could do that was to use the moneys
recieved for fixing the ol' turdbus up a little.  The
film company insured my bus and let me on the set to make sure everything
went as planned.  Everything worked out 
pretty well.
