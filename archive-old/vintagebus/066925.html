Subject: Re: 88mm cylinder needed

&gt;otherwise, anyone have any success repairing broken cast iron :)

I don't have any personal experience, but I have been told by people
that I trust that this is tricky, but possible.  The main problem seems
to be that cast iron doesn't dissipate heat very well, so welding creates
a large temperature differential that leads to cracking.  The way to fix
this is to heat up the whole piece quite a bit (e.g. in a forge) and weld
it while it's hot.  I have heard of this being done for the heads on big
diesels, and also for custom front spindles to put Vanagon disc brakes on
a '68 Bus.  BTW, the modified spindles passed TUeV.

This would probably work for a cylinder but I would wonder about the
cylinder going out-of-round from the heating and cooling.  If it was
just a little out a re-hone might fix it but otherwise you might end
up with a fully finned but useless cylinder.
