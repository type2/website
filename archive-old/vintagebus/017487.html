&gt; Hi Ken,
&gt; FM radio has been around since the late 1940s!  Check out this 
&gt; website for 
&gt; all sorts of radios for VWs from WWII to the 70s: gutefahrt_dot_com    
&gt; Eric&amp;Barb
&gt; PS If the radio is actually from 1961 or earlier and looks clean it 
&gt; probably 
&gt; is worth $100.00 even not working.  EEE&amp;B
&gt;
Well looks like my smarty pants have been swatted!

Wrong as usual.

I will never put a radio in the * front * of my bus
I like to drive with both hands and any distraction 
that keeps me from listing to my kombi's mechanical sounds
or paying attention to traffic around me is dangerous.

Driving my kombi, even in the wide open x country excursions,
never left me board enough to want a radio.

How about all you hams out there. Any vintage 
mobile units that would be period correct?

Better wait until Friday

Ken
