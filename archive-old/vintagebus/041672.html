&gt; Hi, i recently got a 1966 Standard VW Bus.. and it need new tires, whats the 
&gt; factory recommended size for those busses ? right now it has 185/17/14's.. 
&gt; Anyone have any opinions on about what kind/sizes of tires to get for a bus 
&gt; like this ? 

WOW!  17-series tires!  Your bus must handle like a skateboard!

Actually, you probably mean 75 series, which is too small for your bus.
I'll bet the load rating is way below the required 1540 pounds.

Your best bet is 185R14 (no numbers in the middle!) load range D tires.
These are available from Bridgestone (Firestone dealers), Hercules,
Yokohama, and Michelin.

Dealers don't tend to carry this size and they _will_ invariably try to
switch you to the 195/75R14 size.  They would much rather sell you
something in stock than go through the hassle of ordering the correct tire
for you.  If forced to buy the 195/75 size, be sure to get load range D,
as even load range C does not have enought capacity for a bus.

Best bet is to order tires in advance of need.  That way you don't get
stuck.
