Subject: How Much Paint?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Getting close to paint on my westy and I'm thinking about picking
up a gallon today at the paint shop. Will one gallon do the job?
My guess is no, I just don't want to buy too much. The poptop,
wheels, emblem and bumpers don't count here.  I'll be spraying
single stage urethane from an HVLP gun both inside and out on
the westy (I've already sprayed the engine compartment). 

Thanks,
Everett Rein
