&lt;&lt; I've seen two safari antenna solutions: one way is an antenna with 2 90 
degree bends, mounted on the side in the stock location.  The other is the 
twin-post antenna mounted over the emblem  in the center. &gt;&gt;
Hi Volks,
We have also seen Hirshler (SP?) made antennas used on buses.  These are the 
type of antennas that have a solid metal rod at the base of the antenna that 
has a slight hour glass taper to it.  Have seen these mounted to the left of 
the left windscreen and also center.  The left mounting the base is mounted 
at about a 45 degree angle to vertical and then the solid metal base of the 
rod it actually bent to vertical.  The other mounting is just above the VW 
emblem and then bent at it's base so the antenna rod tilt back but misses the 
roof gutter.  Have seen a very simular to these Hishler antennas manufactured 
in the very early to late 1950s made by Bosch which we have seen used for the 
split and oval window bug and most likely the bus also.    Eric&amp;Barb
