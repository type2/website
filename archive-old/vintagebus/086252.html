&gt; &gt; Checked the fuel level in the float chamber, a little low 25mm from top,
&gt; &gt; but i'm on the thinest needle gasket - can I run without a gasket ?
&gt;
&gt; Bentley calls for 17 to 19 mm from the top; being a quarter-inch lower
&gt; than that sounds like a lot to me.  I'm not sure how much not having a
&gt; gasket would help, as Bentley says they only vary 1 mm between thickest
&gt; and thinnest.  On the other hand, maybe the Pierburg carburetor is
&gt; different enough for these specifications not to apply.

Just for grins, I measured some Solex 34-3 floats I have.  They were
all 8mm from the center of the pivot to where it contacts the needle
valve, and 24mm from the pivot to the center of the float.  This would
give you a 3:1 ratio between float height and needle valve depth, so
changing the needle gasket by 1mm should change the float height about
3mm.

I also measured a few needle valves and found they differed by up to
1mm in installed height.  They were all used, so this could just be
due to normal wear.  If you needed more float height with the smallest
gasket you could probably file another 1-2mm off the needle valve
itself.

The Keihin carb in my old H***a had a sight glass in each of the float
bowls which made checking float height really easy.  I have thought
about drilling and tapping the Solex float bowl for a sight glass
(McMaster sells NPT-threaded sight glasses as small as 5/8&quot;), but the
walls of the casting might be too thin.
