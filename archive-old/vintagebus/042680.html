&gt; Wait, wasnt it for sale at the classic for 8000$?
Might have been the original asking price,

But i believe it sold at the classic for around $4,500 as the previous
owner was desperate to buy a 23 window and needed to unload the firetruck
to get it. I have heard all this thirdhand through the &quot;grapevine&quot; but am
pretty sure the number is close.

I really dont know what firetrucks are worth, and it looks like the new
owner has added some of the firetruck stuff it was missing, i just thought
it was worth mentioning... It seems nowadays if a bus ends up in
california the price automagically doubles for some reason...

take care,

Steve

p.s. the shop here in town that did all the mechanical work on that bus
has a good reputation. im sure its in great condition.
