&gt; I agree!  The people I've helped (with no reservation BTW) had never even heard of the AIRS site!  They had just been handed the print out of people by others along the way.  Two out of the three couldn’t have mechanically helped anyone else on the list since they didn't know a distributor cap from a gas cap.  Let alone have tools or supplies.

They might not have any mechanical ability, but they still might direct
you to a local mechanic, provide a camping spot, internet access, etc.
AIRS isn't just a &quot;breakdown society&quot;
