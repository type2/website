 &lt;&lt; I fail to see why you would want to 'correct' this problem. A shorter
  turning radius is a good thing. &gt;&gt;
 Hi Craig,
 If the turning radius is too small to one side and to large to the other 
 there is a good chance of having the steering lock up due to this unbalance 
 or at best cause unusual wear to the steering box.  Eric&amp;Barb

I had an uneven turn radius in my 61 deluxe after it had been hit.  Turned 
out that the impact had tweaked the drag link.   (was actually hit on drivers 
side at the center of the wheel- the dust cap dissapeared, the door damaged, 
bit under seat mushed it  etc)  I could turn tighter to one side than the 
other.  This was very annoying.  Not the tighter turn, but the real wide 
turn.    After  replacing the drag link it had the same turn radius at each 
side.  Yea!!!!
