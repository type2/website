Subject: RE: [VB] pulley ratio - 356/912 pulley offset issues?

  After extensive testing (aka many miles) the pullys didn't hold up. The
center started to wollow due to the belt starting to groove the pulley. The
next one is going to be anealed to harden the aluminum to see if they hold
up better.

How about the aluminum one you show on oldvolks?
