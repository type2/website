&gt; I read an article in Popular Mechanics and in Road &amp; Track some years

more 
&gt; synthetic than others. (And it is debateable whether or not synthetic 
&gt; oil is any better for your engine anyway, definitely not better for
your 
&gt; wallet) As long as the oil has the little ASI Approved circle, star

Quite true.  All oils are made to meet a standard, and what
manufacturer in its right mind would spend a penny more to make the
oil better than the standard requires?  They can make more profit by
putting money into advertising than by improving the oil.

I usually buy the cheapest oil at the FLAPS that comforms to the
latest standard (currently SJ).  Usually this ends up being Mobil, but
now and then Havoline (Texaco) is a bit cheaper.

The main thing to remember is that the brand of oil doesn't make a
whole lot of difference to your engine, but the frequency of change is
quite important!
