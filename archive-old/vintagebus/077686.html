&gt;On the way back, though, just after sunset, the accelerator
&gt;cable broke and, unusually for me, we were carrying NO tools
&gt;or parts. I managed to rig up a working repair using my
&gt;Swiss army knife and a small spring I found on the parcel
&gt;tray. Got the bus running just as it got too dark to see
&gt;underneath.
&gt;
&gt;Back in Jo'burg I went in search of a new cable, but no one
&gt;had stock, and the manufacturers have it on back order. So I
&gt;made a more permanent repair with wire. Been running the bus
&gt;with the jury-rigged wire repair ever since.

I drove my double cab for a month or so with a piece of monofilament 
fishing line tied to the throttle arm, out the engine compartment lid, over 
the top of the tailgate and in the window right behind my left 
shoulder.  Pull string to go faster, let go to go slower....

This had the disadvantage of making me drive with one hand off the wheel 
all the time, making shifting a bit dodgy, but the stretchyness of the line 
prevented those jackrabbit starts.
