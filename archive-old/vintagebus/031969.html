&lt;&lt; This morning when I cranked him up, there was a funny, almost 'rubbing' 
sound. (It sounds very much like the sound my 68 made when its generator 
died.) &gt;&gt;
Hi Joy,
1.  The bearings in the alternator could be going bad due to a cheapy 
rebuild.  Could also be the bearings are going bad due to over tightening the 
fan belt.  
2.  Could be the cooling fan has cracked around the mounting nut and washers. 
 To check this reach around the fan shroud with the engine turned OFF and see 
if the fan wiggles front/rear.
3.  Check your alternator to it's stand strap to make sure it is tight and 
not broken.  You might loosen this strap and push or pull the shroud 
forward/backward to see if shroud/alternator has just shifted and this has 
caused the fan to rub inside of it.  If moving the shroud makes the rubbing 
sound go away then just retighten the strap.
