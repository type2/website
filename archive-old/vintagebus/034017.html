&lt;&lt; I was wondering today - For those special Kombis that were ordered with
 2-tone paint (not standards), did they still come with black seat upholstery?
  &gt;&gt;
er- unless they came with grey or salt and pepper seat upholstery depending 
on year.

good question, though.  

hm-   I could excavate the layer under my camper  (two tone combi) front seat 
covers and see if it is the commercial style or the passenger style seat 
covers- i know there are tatters of s&amp;p there
