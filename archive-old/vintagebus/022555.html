Subject: Fuel tank valve gasket leak
Message-Id: &lt;3.0.6.32.19990627060907.00813470_at_mail.jps_dot_net&gt;

Hi all,

Well, for the last couple of weeks, I've had this spot under my '64 Single
and realized that it was gasoline by the location directly under the tank
valve.  What I want to know is, what others have done to make a good seal
or gasket for the screw-on bolt that holds the little tube into the bottom
of the tank?  Any suggestions?

Thanks,

Steven
