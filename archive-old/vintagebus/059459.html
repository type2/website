Subject: Re: [VB] 1/3-2/3 seat question

I have had good luck with sandblasting and powdercoating the frames....

&gt;I just picked up a ratty 1/3-2/3 seat and have a
&gt;question about reupholstery.  Did the back of the 2/3
&gt;portion of the seat have anything on it, except for
&gt;the top 6&quot; or so?  From what I've discovered, the back
&gt;was not covered with upholstrey of any kind, leaving
&gt;the springs exposed.  Since nobody really ever saw
&gt;this area, I would bet that is the case.
&gt;
&gt;Also, are there any recommendations for restoring
&gt;frames?  Sandblast and paint?  Something more
&gt;detailed?  It looks like all the springs are in decent
&gt;shape, but the whole frame on both seats is covered in
&gt;rust.  Mostly surface rust, but rust nonetheless.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;Paul
