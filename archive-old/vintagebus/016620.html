You have one bug, and one bus headlight.  The best deals are _at_ the swaps;
headlights generally gofor ~$10 each, complete.  I've seen 'em for more,
bought 'em for less.  Euro headlights are way more, as high as $400 for
used, to $150 for NOS, at least on ebay.

Try to get a matched set of the same brand, hella or bosch.  There's a 
a small drain hole that should be at the bottom.  Some have it, some
don't, but that's the easiest way to tell left from right.  I've been
seeing an awful lot of &quot;pairs&quot; of NOS light which are actually two
of the same side.  The vendors even display them as if they're a 
set, but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to see they're mismatched.
This is even more important with euro lights, which have special
lensing which can't be inverted.
