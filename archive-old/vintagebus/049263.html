Greg:

The only thing I can help you on is advice, and has to do with the flip hatch seal.  I researched long and hard to figure out what is correct and how it is installed.  I found a bus with the original seal still in it.  Here's the dope:

Thom is correct, buy a 10' section of GERMAN cargo door seal from WW, try and get one without a seam.  I tried but was unsuccesful, you might  have more luck, but the stuff is extruded in certain lengths so I think you'll be stuck with a seamed piece.  The seal is one continuous piece, and the the joint or seam is in the center of the forward side of the hatch (the hatch is a rectangle, the side of the rectangle where the seam butts together is the forward side).  The corners are mitred half way through the seal.  You'll need to cut out a section like a piece of pie shape from the seal, a 90 degree section, half way through, if that makes sense.  You'll cut through top to bottom, but only half way through from inside edge toward the outer edge.  That way when the seal turns the corner it doesn't bunch up.  Experiment on a sample piece to get the proper amount to cut out.  I also had to cut about the bottom 35-40% of the seal off so that it would fit down flush with the hatch as the longer sides of the hatch are too narrow to allow it to seat down completely.  If yours is the same as mine you'll need to do this, otherwise you'll never get your hatch to close completey, well not is this century anyway.
