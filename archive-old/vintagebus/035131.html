&lt;&lt;do?  Also, someone asked &lt;&lt; Also, what is the best spline lube?  &gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;and the replys ranged from chassis lube to Bosch distributor grease.  What's
the &lt;&lt;best lubricant to use here?  I can't find anything about it in my
'Bentley' manual.

------------------------------

This is one of those Conventional Wisdom thingees.  Chassis lube or
distributor grease will work but the truth is, the splines on the mainshaft
and clutch-disk are not 'lubricated' in the usual sense of the word.  Other
than the few thou of run-out in the flywheel and the expansion of the pads,
the clutch disk does not move on the mainshaft.  (What happens is that the
friction pads are allowed to expand.  Take a look at a clutch-disk.  See those
leaf-springs between the friction pads?  Now imagine it squashed flat.  Half
that amount -- seldom more than sixty thou or so -- is all the 'motion' the
hub will ever see.)  If there is no motion, there is no need for lubrication.
The pressure-plate moves, releasing the compression on the clutch disk
allowing it to spin at a rate different from the engine, but there is no
significant fore &amp; aft motion of the clutch disk... hence no need for
'lubrication'.

So why does everybody grease the thing?  Mostly because somebody told them to.
But like all Conventional Wisdoms, this one is based on a kernal of truth.  A
TINY amount of grease applied to the splines will prevent the mainshaft and
clutch-disk from rusting together.  (You've never really played mechanic until
you're asked to separate an engine &amp; tranny that have rusted together :-)  The
problem here is that grease really isn't the best stuff to use, and most folks
use too much of it anyway.  

The VW clutch-disk is pretty small to begin with.  It doesn't take much grease
to ruin it.  Most of the ones I see have a pattern of greasy radial rays
around the hub indicating the thing was installed with a glob of grease...
which then flung itself all over.

The purpose of the splined junction between the clutch-disk and the mainshaft
is POWER TRANSMISSION and in that regard it's best to treat this junction as
you would the junction between your rear axles and your brake drums, which is
to scrub a high-quality metallic-based anti-sieze compound into the splines in
both components, being careful to wipe off any residue -- you don't want
grease on your clutch any more than on your brake shoes.  The oily base of the
anti-sieze (the good ones use high-temp silicon) protects the junction from
rusting while the metallic component of the anti-sieze compound gets bonded to
the splines by heat and pressure, keeping it from being fling-off.  The result
guarantees the parts will not rust together yet provides perfect power
transmission without any risk of contaminating the friction pads.

I use that copper-based stuff and an old toothbrush, then I wipe it down hard
-- you can't get that copper-stuff out of the splines... which is exactly
where you want it.

I'm going to post this to the List.  It's bound to set someone's hair on fire
:-)
