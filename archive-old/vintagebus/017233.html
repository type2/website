I am in the process of getting my 63 singlecab back to original shape. It will be dove blue. I have some questions re originality.
1) Is the rear view mirror painted or chromed?
2) The spare tyre carrier in the treasure chest. Should it be black or painted to match the body?
3) Should the hubcaps be grey?
4) Should the bumpers be white?
5) Should there be a volkswagen logo inbetween the engine hatch and the drop gate?

TIA
