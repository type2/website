Man, I really don't want this to sound insulting... as I'm sure you must
have thought of it, but it needs to be said :)

Why not just get a 1971 bus?  The ball joint front ends is a lot nicer ride,
poptops are a lot nicer, you can get poptop canvas that is 2x as big for 1/2
the price, etc, brakes are awesome, etc, etc.

In fact, about the only thing I can say negative about a 1971 is that they
are expensive to find in good condition (more so than many splits!) ...
especially a Westy.  As they are so versatile and great for just USING and
not collecting.  People will gladly pay $6K for a good one that needs
paint.... because people appreciate the value of a Westy, even if they
aren't into VW's :)

And maintenance is a lot simpler on these as you point out... especially the
1971 still using the Type 1 engine.

Now they didn't offer propane until later, but pretty standard kits that
would retro into a '71... or find a later Loaf and just convert it over to
Type 1 engine.  Keep your split what it was... and keep the loaf for your
trips.

Of course, I respect your decision as it is yours, but it is sure hard
having owned a 1971 bus to see why anyone would want to go through all that
trouble with a splitty when VW already built what you are attempting.  Just
to have that front windshield?

And the trend toward unique models like Westy's turning into really
expensive collector items is starting to happen with loafs too.  I know many
on this list might laugh at that, but go try to find a rust-free Loaf Westy
or Truck.  They are actually more prized than Splits by many... for the
mechanical and camping kit reasons that Ronnie is hinting at...

    While we're on the subject of non-original parts, I very much want to 
build (or better yet buy)a stock height camper to travel in that does not 
have reduction boxes. Don't get me wrong I've got them on my 59' and plan to

keep them there, I just dont want to get stuck in some backwoods town with
RB 
trouble where the mechanics only have standard tools and they used all the 
old buses for target practice. The RBs are just something that if they go, 
you dont. no way to hobble home when ones shot. Should I just look for a bus

with a later bus irs in it already (I don't think I could bring my self to 
cut one up that much) or put one of the stock height kits in. keeping in
mind 
that I will be grafting a pop top into the bus and full camper set up with 
propane burners, a fridge, months worth of supplies and camping gear for 
hikes. so ther will be quite a bit of weight. I can have a local shop
rebuild 
a tranny with custom gearing for the same price as a stock rebuild if this 
makes a difference. the engine will be a 1600 (maybe 1641) w/doghouse
cooler. 

On a side note, I will be putting My 60' kombi up for sale. I cant bring my 
self to cut a hole in the roof for a pop top. I'm going to find one with
more 
mods to cut. It has a small nut tranny, new brakes with about 30 miles on 
them and a rebuilt 1600sp. needs paint and a rocker welded in but comes with

one from RMMW.  Over all very straight. This is the same bus that had the 
clunk after shifting that I asked the list about. I never investigated 
further (its still raining up here) but it was thought by most to be the 
front tranny mount or the reduction box to spring plate bolts needing to be 
tourqed down. one slightly fuzzy picture at

I'll try to get more up soon.
