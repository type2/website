Karl -
 In regards to the arm length, he mail have been refering to to Base size.
The &quot;recall&quot; arms had a larger base which was taller, but the arm was the
same length. As to windering how many VOA has left in stock, the answer is a
big fat none. VOA discontinued the p/n several years ago. There was a black
Brazilian variety available (not bad construction either) until recently
when it was obsoleted too.
 The 68 Ghia arms dogsbody is refering to are actually &quot;hook&quot; type arms that
fit 67-69 K Ghias. In might be further mentioned that if this option is
followed, use only the Left Ghia Wiper Arm as this is &quot;straight&quot;. The Right
Ghia Wiper Arm is bent about 8 to 10 degrees at the end so that the wiper
blade would be horizontal when parked on a Ghia windshield. Excellent repros
of the arms (left) are available, but at a rather pricey $31.50 each.

&gt; I am confused. I have a 66 bus and a 67 bus. The length of the arms are
&gt; the same on both. The only thing
&gt; different between the 2 is the 67 has had the arms replaced with the
&gt; 'recall' arms. What are recall arms you
&gt; ask?
&gt; &lt;SNIP&gt;
&gt; That is 3.7 million vehicles x 2 arms..... = 7.4 million arms..... hmmm, I
&gt; wonder how many VWoA has left
&gt; in stock??
