Subject: Re: [VB] Blaupunkt Radio



Try checking with Wilfred Wilkes of the Vintage Radio Shop in Brisbin,
PA.  Phone 814-378-8526.  He specializes in repairing antique European
auto radios and might have some spare knobs that he can sell.  It might
help to have the model name of the Blaupunkt available when you call--it
should be on a sticker on the side.

&gt; It has both knobs and it is missing one button.  It has one button that
&gt; has a music sign, another that says &quot;OFF&quot; and the third is missing.  Anyone
&gt; know where I could find one of those buttons or what it said?  Am I  right
&gt; that this is either 6 or 12 volt depending on the position of the thingy or
&gt; is there something inside that has to be changed?  Is there anywhere I can
&gt; look to find out a bit more about these?  &gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; The third knob would be &quot;On&quot;.  To find a button you need to find another
&gt; radio for parts or some radio repair place which might have spare parts
&gt; around.  Eric&amp;Barb
