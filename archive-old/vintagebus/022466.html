Subject: '55 westy - some work and some questions
Mime-Version: 1.0


A friend of mine and I rolled the '55 westy into my garage today, no mean
feat if you consider the mud and uphill push!

Got it inside and on the dollies.  Got to take a good look underneath for
the first time.  There are some dents on the crossmembers, but overall it's
pretty dry and straight under there.  

The center pivot bushing for the steering system is *wasted* - wobbles all
over the place; anyone got the procedure for replacing that handy?

First off will be new brakes all 'round - bought that stuff today.  Spent
1/2 hour with the impact gun trying to break a wheel nut to no avail.
Tried heat, liquid wrench, the whole 9 yards.

My question: on each of the cargo doors, by where they come together, at
the top, is a small metal tab, which looks like something would go over it.
 Looks too well done to be a home job.  Any idea what it is?

Has anyone found or posted '50s west pix?

Over the next few weeks I'll be doing the brakes and reduction box gears,
trying to make this beast road-worthy.
