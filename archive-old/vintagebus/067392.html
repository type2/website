Subject: Re: [VB] vintage ev bus

Dragging a trailer to power generators to charge the battery doesn't fly.   
At best you could break even, but, in fact you'd lose energy, as the trailer 
drag is there and the generators etc  aren't 100% efficient, so you'd end up 
using power to pull the damn trailer, and get part of it back as charging 
batteries, the rest would go into friction,  heat etc.  

I guess you could put gasoline powered generators on a trailer, but that 
defeats the idea, ya?

The hybrid car kind of uses this idea in that it sometimes runs on 
electricaity, and sometimes gasoline, and when running on gasoline it charges 
up the batteries.  This means lots les gas in used.  At least that's how I 
understand the hybrid cars.

actually, lots of people do take trips less that 50 miles, so it'd work for 
that.

&lt;&lt; It looks better than most of the 10k buses I see for
 sale, that's for sure! It's too bad the distance was a
 little better though. I don't think I know any one who
 drives much less than 50 miles one way to work.
 All you need now is a hitch so you can pull a trailer
 with a few good sized generators whose pulleys have
 belts connected to the trailer wheel(s)or axle so you
 can drive that bus anywhere! :)
