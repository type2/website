True. 90wt. Hypoid. 1/2 pint. 

Another interesting fact that I just learned a few months ago...and the wizards of gizzards knew all along... The tranny and the reduction boxes share fluid. They do this through the axle tubes. Tip your bus about 15 degrees either way and the fluid flows. This doesn't cause problems inherently, but if you have a leaky redux box, you may find yourself needing to replace fluid at the tranny from time to time...until you fix that leaky box which I must do soon. ;) 

Of course, if you never replace the fluid or you never tip your bus enough (and long enough) for the fluid to be replaced, you end up frying your redux box bearings, which are not as easy to replace as say...points. One of the bearings isn't so bad; the other is pretty serious.

Have fun! Joe

&gt;They use 90WT hypoid gear oil.  I think about 1/2 pint each.
