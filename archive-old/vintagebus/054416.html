Sata Jet is by far the best gun on the market.. I use the NR 2000, once you 
use one, you'll never use another!!!!  They have another gun out now too, 
that they say is even better, I can't imagine!!  Sata Jet has awesome 
atomization!!! Which is what breaks those paint particles up and &quot;lays&quot; the 
paint down!!!  

Good luck.
