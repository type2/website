Subject: Re: [VB] Trip report: Yosemite, etc.

Good Job! Next time you go through there try and stop at Saddlebag Lakes near the summit of Tioga pass. There is a little campground near the highway (120) and a few miles back there are at least 7 lakes where you can get a &quot;Sierra Slam&quot;. Between all the lakes you can catch all of the species of trout California has to offer; Brook, Cutthroat, Golden, Brown and Rainbow. The Tuolumne Meadows area is one of my favorite spots in California. I was short a Golden on my last trip, but I hope to remedy that in July, at the SV2's Yosemite Campout.
