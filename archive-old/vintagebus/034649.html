&gt;  motor last night to find all kinds of nice suprises! It had been converted 
&gt;  to 12 volt, but the bell housing hadnt been clearanced very well,if at 
&gt;  all.The fly wheel is kinda chewed up also.this thing had a ton of end play 
&gt;  on the crank,I pulled the fly wheel to find the gland nut to be torqued to 
&gt;  about 30 pounds!The thing is,the motor sounded really strong other than 
the 
&gt;  knock,no smoke or anything like that.Do you guys think its still ok? I 
&gt;  figure the fact that it was hitting the bell housing and had a loose fly 
&gt;  wheel pretty well accounts for the noise so........
&gt;                                                           TIA,Carl

A loose flywheel will make a horrible noise.  Torque it down properly and 
check the end play, and reset if needed.  this means buying a new FW seal, 
and do the o ring too while your are at it.  grinding the tranns with the FW 
also makes bad noises.  so, since yours is chewed, find a good one (12V o 
ring FWs are plentiful and should be cheeap, maybe $10 or free)

good luck, it may be just fine
