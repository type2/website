Subject: [VB] Emergency FLasher Unit for 65 bus

I hope this makes it to the list because I don't think i did it right.

Long story short i need an emergency flasher relay for my 1965 deluxe.
I bought one that is 5 prongs 12v and it has stampings like this:
http://i21.photobucket_dot_com/albums/b259/MandyBus/Parts/relay.jpg
if you can't make it out the letters are (clockwise, starting at the top) L,
B+, I, G- and in the center its L

I would like to know if this is the right unit for my bus and if so which
wires go where. I have a brand new wiring works harness which is supposed to
be to factory spec.

please help, I'd like to get my bus to my auto body class tomorrow. (with
brake lights and turn signals)
