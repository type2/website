Subject: [VB] Seat frame restoration
Message-ID: &lt;0.c09ef07d.2550ec01_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

I have a bench seat frame for my 59' panel and was wondering how you guys 
would get rid of and prevent the light surface rust that has attacked the 
frame and the  springs. This would be a PITA to    hand sand off!
Would you  recommend sandblasting? acid dip? POR-15?
Then should I paint it black?
--Also, Is the upholstery originally  held on w/ hogrings?
Are seat covers/padding hard to install and look great (no creases?)  
yourself. Iv'e got a grey,  no piping or pleats cover in the mail that Lenny_at_ 
WCCR stitched     for me  and Wolfsburg West's new repro horse-hair padding. 
Would you reccomend getting it professionally  installed by an 
auto-upholstery guy, or Do it myself?
