No offense to the Michigan VW Club, but given all the bad feelings that
VWoA engenders for its nonsupport of its ACVW legacy, and for its
heavy-handed persecution of VW-related Internet sites, it's a wonder
that a chapter of the VVWCA wants to be seen anywhere near their
corporate HQ.  (Typical comment:  They only put up with the old VWs when
it can help them sell New Beetles.)

Just wondering out loud...

&gt; Here is the latest update on the Michigan Vintage Volkswagen Club (Chapter
&gt; of the national VVWCA) &quot;Michigan Vintage Volkswagen Festival&quot; in Auburn
&gt; Hills in May.  This is always a great Midwest VW weekend event, very laid
&gt; back and social, and because of that, many of us travel great lengths in
&gt; our VW's to attend.  This event is held at Volkswagen of America's
&gt; corporate headquarters in Auburn Hills, a northwestern suburb of Detroit.
&gt; There are several changes to make note of.  Mark your calendars for a fun
&gt; road trip!
