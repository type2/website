Dear Friends,

I have put together a list of Great Bus Tour Drivers and Friends of the
Great Bus Tour. If you don't want to receive e-mailed updates about the Bus
Tour, please just use the &quot;return&quot; button on your e-mail program, return
this message to me with a note that you want to be removed from the e-mail
list and I will take you off the list.

I have put up the new Great Bus Tour web page which may be viewed at
http://www.type2_dot_com/~chuff . I can't thank Ken Hooper enough for helping me
with this! It's because of him and the generosity of the list gods that we
have this web page, so Kudos and many thanks to them!

It looks like John Anderson has the hubcap...ahem...baton now and is
planning to hand off to John Hartranft in Michigan sometime soon. I have
written both John A. and John H. but have received no reply as of this
writing. I have asked John H. to hand off to Buddah in Chicago and then hope
to pass the baton around in the Midwest while it is there. To those in
Alabama, please accept my apologies! My thinking was that if I could get
Dave Easterwood to hold on to the baton, I would sent it on to you then to
Mississippi and then north to the Midwest but it looks now that it is
happening the other way round.

So, the plan now is to pass the baton around the Midwest then to head south
to Alabama and Mississippi and then west to Texas and there north to
Oklahoma, Colorado, Montana, Idaho and Washington then south to Oregon,
California, and jog to Arizona and then back to California and then on to
Australia.

This is NOT set in concrete! Any and all suggestions will be greatly
appreciated! I have not heard from anyone in Canada (as you will see if you
visit the website) and if someone up there writes we can change the route
when it is headed north.

I hope to have a list of drivers up on the web page in the next day or so.
That should facilitate some of the planning. Please feel free to comment on
the web page and the Tour route!!!! Helpful criticism and suggestions are
always welcome!

Thank you for your continued interest and support!

Chris and Gus in Atlanta
