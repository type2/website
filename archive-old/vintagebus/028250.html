Subject: Shift bushing

How many versions of the forward shift rod bushing are there?  I know
the 67 one is different than the badminton type one, but is there a
different one than that.  I need the one for a 62.  I tried the
badminton one, but it seemed too big for the bracket.  I couldn't push
it through.  Did I get a poorly made one?  Is there a smaller one for
pre 63 busses?   Also which way does the tapered end face?

Thanks!

Steve
