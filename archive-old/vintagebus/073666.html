Subject: Bus Tunes...

After years of putting stereos in busses, I have a system that I really
like and is pretty much invisible. It utilizes 5 1/4&quot; mids mounted down
in the kick panels and seperate tweeters hidden behind the headliner up
above. If you look for sales and listen to a bunch of these seperates
you can find a new set for the same price as a good set of 6x9's or box
speakers. You can mount the mids to a board and then perforate the vinyl
in front or use a loose knit speaker cloth to cover the speakers. If you
use a cloth that matches the vinyl color it is almost impossible to see
from outside the van. If you want to make it easier you can mount the
mids directly to the kick panels but it will not be as stealthy of an
install. Since the highs are mostly responsible for the stereo
seperation and clarity, you don't really lose much by having the mids
firing into your knees. You can easily run the wires up the sides for
the tweaters. Use a small punch to open up the perforations in the
headliner and cut the cardboard out to let the tweeter sit in the hole.
I taped mine in place and they stayed that way for 5 years before I sold
my Double cab. I mounted the CD player under the dash and above the
parcel tray. I had it slid back in as far as I could so that when the
face plate was off it was barely visible. The amp for the front speakers
goes under the front seat and then I used a pair of 10&quot; JL audio subs
under the back seat with a seperate amp. The easiest way to get added
bass is by using one of the amplified subs on the market. I really like
the Bazooka ones as they deliver alot of good tight bass, are easy to
find used, and have very durable fiberglass enclosures.
You will not win any stereo competitions with this setup but you will
have really nice clean sound that no one will know about. The next step
for me would be to get rid of the CD player. It sounds like you Ipod
people might have that figured out. Leave a plug in for the amp out so
you plug in your I pod and go. You would have absolutely nothing visible
to show off to thieves.

hope this helps,
