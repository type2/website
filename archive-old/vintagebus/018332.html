&quot;But it's 50x70x16, that's bigger than 54x74x24,&quot; he says.
&quot;How is that?&quot;  I ask
&quot;Well 50 is bigger than 24&quot;
&quot;Huh?  50 is less than 54,&quot; and I point to their size chart to show that
50 is less than 54 and 70 is less than 74 and 16 is less than 24.  &quot;It's
less!&quot; I state.

He looked puzzled and went to measure it again.  &quot;Oh, you're right, it will
fit.&quot; he mumbled.



Oh I know that guy.  He's the Republican candidate running for President...right??
