I would agree with you. Please check the float valve, and do not forget to 
examine carefully your float, as it nay be brittle by now and thus cannot 
longer push the plunger tottaly up.
I find, that with the Ethanol fuel mix, this happens now more often.
Also, please do replace your flexible fuel hoses at least every 2 years, as 
they get equally stiff and brittle....(engine fire!)
All my Best for a happy 2007 VW Bus motoring!
