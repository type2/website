Subject: 21 Window going in for surgery

Tomorrow my '66 21 window will be heading to the body shop for the MUCH
awaited repairs.

After being without a bus for a few years I am now finding myself awake each
night in anticipation.

Anyway

I have ordered some metal pieces from Alan Schofeild and hopefully it won't
take too long for them to arrive but I still need two pieces.

Above each of the front cab doors the metal at the weatherstripping channel is
rusted out.  Anyone on here have any donor metal or know where I can find
some?

Also, has anyone tried to fit Alan's B-Pillar pieces yet?
