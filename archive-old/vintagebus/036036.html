 Has anybody out there driven a 40 HP 1500 plus miles on a single journey???
 I really want to drive the side loader single cab back from iowa/nebraska,
 but have never had a long distance experience with a totaly stock bus!!! It
 should be a blast as the bus has been totally restored (refreshed?) rebuilt
 engine, new brakes, paint, interior, etc. so the ride should be nice and the
 bus should make it, anybody want to meet me in Iowa and ride back to az.or
 New Mexico, doing some wrecking yarding and bus hunting along the way?? Have
 tools will travel.

I drove a 59 sc 850 miles in two days, with 40hp motor, little nut tranny and 
low gears.  Kept it 55 or slower on I-5.  no music the whole way, and it 
Purred like a kitten, 28mpg.  Had wiring issues, but it was a POS when I got 
it.

you're not worried about driving a 40hp are you?  they kick booty big time.
