Subject: Looking for Patrick4949

I am looking for a guy who just had a slammed panel, and maroon slammed (and
airbagged) 15 window bus.  Does anyone know how I can get in touch with him?
His email was Patrick4949_at_'something'_dot_com

If someone can get me in touch with this person, it would be greatly
appreciated.

Thank you
Charles
