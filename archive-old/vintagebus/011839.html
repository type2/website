&gt; Hi Rebecca,
&gt; First you should check your seat to see if someone over padded it.  
This is a definite possibility, as the original padding was only about
1/2 inch thick over the springs.  By contrast, I redid mine with 1
inch firm padding over 1/4 inch thick indoor-outdoor carpeting over
the springs.  Made a big difference, as my eyes are now at the level
of the top edge of the side windows.

On the other side of the coin, if you don't have enhanced padding,
don't expect to lower the seat by removing stock padding.  There just
isn't enough to remove!

Removing
&gt; the extra padding will help.  We also due to my hieght like to
remove the
&gt; upholstery from the drivers seat and trim a coil off of the seat
springs to
&gt; lower my 5' 11&quot; hieght.

It's easier to just &quot;restrain&quot; the springs a bit with wire, so that
they cannot reach thier full height.  Seat springs aren't all that
easy to find, and cutting them is irreversible.
