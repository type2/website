Subject: Re: [VB] bus cover?

You might want to give California Car Covers a try at
http://www_dot_calcarcover_dot_com/.  According to their ordering menu, they
even claim to offer a cover specifically for crewcabs--only place I've
found that does.

&gt; Does anyone make a split bus specific bus cover?  I looked on a few on
&gt; the on-line parts places websites and couldnt come across anything
&gt; specifically for a splitty.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not interested in something made for a motoehome that &quot;will get me
&gt; by&quot;, was hoping fpr something form-fitting.
