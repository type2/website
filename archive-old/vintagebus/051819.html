Subject: BBB VI/ charity success

   The London Bridge Bullis would like to thank all that participated in
Buses by the Bridge 6. With the registration, raffle, chile cook off and
auction we will be able to donate $3000.00 to Arizona Chridrens Foundation,
with the funds staying in Lake Havasu. Those that were here will know where
the money goes to and those that didn't make it are more then welcome to ask
me. We surpassed last years donation by $1000.00, again many THANKS to those
that attended for without you this wouldn't happen.

ronnie  London Bridge Bullis  (aka BBB)

meeting next week on a new locaation. If everything works out I will post
pics of the new location.

is interested. Over 600 pics of BBB VI
