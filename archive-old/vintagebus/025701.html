Hi All,

We will be attending both the Burgermaster and the Vintage meets on
Friday and Saturday. I'm hoping we can get together and meet some
listees at some point, especially some Seattle folks who I know are
around, but have not met. Any suggestions ??

We are offering, once again, a place to tie up, rest, shower, etc. for
those coming from out of town. Also anyone needing repairs, welding,
whatever are welcome to call and use our shop.

Sunday, we will host a BBQ for those wishing to visit with other VW
types, but need to know approximately how many will attend.
