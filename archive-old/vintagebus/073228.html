At idle, my stock 1600 sp with stock air cleaner and brazilian 30/31
(almost new) runs REALLY rich. I'd classify it as a &quot;gross polluter&quot;
here in the land of wacky elections.

I've dropped the main down to a 112 and it runs great and even idles
great once warmed up. I think that the two idle jets are too big. They
are 55/65 but I'm not sure.

Can I get smaller idle jets? If so where?

Thanks.

Steve, I stock a full compliment of pilot (idle) and main jets for solexs from 40 to 65 on the pilots and from 110 to 175 on the mains. Soon I will also have air correction in a varity of sizes.

You can also contact Low Budget Racing (the kings of Kadrons) as the mains and idles are the same in the Kadrons as the solex 28 to 34 carbs except cal emission which use a totaly different main jet
