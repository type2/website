Subject: Re: [VB] go ahead and flame me... this bus is cool!!

&gt;&gt;We used to see that bus cruising all over Pinellas county,&lt;&lt;

We vacation twice a year in Maderia Beach (where this bus use to reside) and
noticed it a year ago one block off the beach on a side street. We were driving
along and my wife screams to turn around, that I won't believe what she just
saw! We were down there over Turkey Day this year and went looking for it again.
I was going to take a e-photo and put it on the list, but it was gone. When we
saw it a year ago it did not look near as good as it does now! My wife felt
sorry for it and wanted to stop and make an offer.
