Just to clarify, unless I am the only one who didnt
know, Haggerty Insurance is designed for show cars.
They are not interested in daily drivers.  They quote
no mileage limitation, but I was told that they do use
the industry standard of 2,500 miles per year. 
Anything beyond that has to be well documented and
justified at the time of claim.  The gentleman that I
spoke to sd they were mostly only interested in
&quot;collectible cars that are only taken to occassional
shows and preferably trailered there&quot;.

In short, anyone but &quot;trailer queens&quot; need not apply!
