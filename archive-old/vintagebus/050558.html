Subject: Help! I screwed up...

Hi everyone,
Wrenching on the bus late last night and I screwed up. I have an oil
temp sender that piggy-backs with adapter to the low oil pressure
sender. Well the oil pressure sender sticking out of the adapter was
hitting the condenser on the dizzy, so I thought I would give it one
little 1/4 turn more to help it clear and yup, stripped out the tapped
threads in the case. I got the low oil sender back in the hole, but it
is just barely holding in there. Any suggestions on how I am going to
get out of this mess? I have some metal epoxy, contains magnesium,
supposedly it can be tapped, I thought I would solicit some advice
before trying this.
Thanks,
Joel
