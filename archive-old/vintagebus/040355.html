It's funny to listen/read all this talk of the moral issues surrounding the hacking of a 21-window bus, especially when it came out of a note I posted reporting on *restoration* progress. When I'm done, this will be the fourth bus I've rescued in as many years. Two I fixed to drivers and sold (at a financial loss; knowledge gain) and the third I drive everyday. 

I parted one earlier this year that might have been savable, though it had some real problems that I didn't want to tackle for the type of bus it was...and I needed the parts--ask Ken: I saved EVERYTHING worth keeping, including nuts and bolts. Want my street address so we can fight?

The 21-window in question came out of a junkyard. It had sat since probably 1975. As you suspect, Clara, the floors are toast. I'll restate the condition of the bus this way: &quot;95 percent of you would have walked away from it. The other 5 percent of you are crazy. Only one percent of you would rescue this bus and see it through to completion. Half of those would send it to Japan. So, I surmise, 99.5 percent of you would not rescue this bus for any moral imperitive.&quot;

I still don't know if I'm in the five percent or the one-half percent. I won't know until I either finish this bus or give up. Truth is, it's not a moral issue with me. I just like to fix old buses.

I know the philosophy behind saving every bus out there. Within reason, I agree. But *you* are more important than your bus and if you want to chop it and lower it and paint it with latex and a brush, that's your business. It's your money; it's your bus. As for me, thanks for the advice and the opinions. In the end, I'm the head-mechanic-in-charge and I'll do what I think is best...whatever that turns out to be.

Take care! Joe
