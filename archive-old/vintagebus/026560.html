Subject: [VB] Torsion Bar Installation Success
Message-ID: &lt;38615169.C26C81A_at_dolphinsci_dot_com&gt;

I noticed that Mike had asked a week or so about trying to get the torsion bars
back into the tubes, but only saw one response to his query.  I fired off a note
to him asking what other responses he received.

&gt; got several responses about tying the bundle tightly together before you put
&gt; them in, one w/ string, 3 w/ those plastic/wire ties. just leave them in
&gt; there, they're fine. several people reported success.  one person had the
&gt; idea of, since you got the dead beam still around, cut that jig out of the
&gt; middle of that and use it as a jig for holding the replacement bars while
&gt; installing, or for tack welding,  [...]

Well, not having a &quot;dead beam&quot; to cut up, I opted to try the plastic wire tie
method.  I put it on the set that I had been working with and with a little
twisting, it slipped into place, and I was able to tap the bars all the way
down.  I went to the second set, bundled them up with the wire tie and could not
get it in no matter how hard I tried.  I then remembered that I had chamfered the
ends of the first set of bars a few days ago.  I pulled the bars out, chamfered
the ends, slid them back down and twist, twist, they dropped into place.

torsion arm, torsion bars, torsion leaves

This is step by step what I did
1. chamfer the ends of the bars with a grinder, about 2.5mm in and 2.5mm down,
clean up any metal filings.
2. bundle up the bars with a wire tie about 1&quot; from end of the bars and past the
dent from the holding bolt. Pull the tie as tight as you can get it without
breaking the tie.
3. Note where the bolt mark is in the center of the arms and line it up with the
center fastening bolt hole
4. Slide the bars down into the tube, when they hit the center mounting block,
twist back and forth until they drop into place
5. tap the bars in until they are centered length wise in the tube.  Tapping is
facilitated by alternating on the bars that are tapped on, slowly working them
bit by bit down the tube.  Do not pound away on the bars as they will bend and
deform.  You will have a nice mushroomed end if you pound on the bars.  Gentle
tapping is enough to get them down there.  You might even tap with a 2x4
absorbing some of the blow.
6. don't worry about the wire tie, it will slide down as the bars move and will
just sit there harmlessly until you take the bars out.

Happy Holidays to all,

Scott
