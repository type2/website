Nope, 4-ply.  The sidewall plys pass under (toward the center of the
wheel) the tread plies.  The two polyester sidewall plies are also the
two polyester tread plies.

Still, this is a fairly robust tire nowadays.  Even my 8-ply rated
Bridgestones have the same configuration.  Tire engineering has moved
on considerably since the days when a ply count was a definite measure
of strength (cotton plies weren't as strong as the current polyester,
y'know!).
