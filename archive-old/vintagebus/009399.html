I think I'll try my hand at a tubular rack
built at the same height as my pop-top ala Hoover.

--------------------------------------------------

I just finished building a 10 foot roof rack for Blue Thunder out of galvanized electrical conduit.  Total cost was less than $50, including the tube bender.  Well, the $500 welder helped too ;-).  It wasn't too terribly difficult, though it got a little tricky at times.  The secret is to build the basic frame on the roof of the bus and making sure all the legs are exactly the same length.  The rest can be done on a flat, level surface.

Any St Louis listees know what the scoop on the Strassenfest VW show is?  As far as I know, it's Sunday, sometime.  I'll be there.  You'll know me, I'll be the dude with the really big balls, cause I'm entering Blue Thunder!  Remember, a vote for me is a vote for anarchy!
