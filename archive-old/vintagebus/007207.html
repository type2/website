&gt;I also looked at my Drag link to see if it was bent, and yes it's bent
&gt;but it looks as if it should have a curve, however mine has been rubbing
&gt;underneath enough to scrape away some paint. I could not tell by the bbb
&gt;how mine was suppose to look, I might have missed that page.


Not only will a bent drag link screw up your steering but if someone ever
monkeyed with the adjustment and screwed it up, this will also cause a
problem.  Keep in mind that there are 2 little cone-head shaped bolts on
each kingpin assembly that acts as a steering stop.  If someone removed one,
ground it down, simply put a bolt in there in place of the actual
cone-headed stop bolt, you will have more play on one side than the other.
