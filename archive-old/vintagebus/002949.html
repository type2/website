Hello everyone,

 Now that BNNTA is over, it is time to remind everyone of the 2nd annual
Josh Rogers Memorial Beer Bash and Campout (JRMBBC II).

 We are going to be at the Turner Falls Campground in Davis, Oklahoma. This
year, the event will be held in the lower campground (they call it the &quot;Cow
Pens&quot; area) instead of the upper where it was held last year.

 Friday, the 15th of Sept through Sunday, the 17th is this years dates and
the cost to get into the grounds is $5.00 per person, per night. Remember to
tell them at the gate that you are with the Josh Rogers Group or they will
charge the normal fee to get in.

 If most of you haven't heard, we are under a burn ban for almost the entire
state. There will be NO CAMPFIRE this year unless it rains before the
campout!!!!! Using your charcoal grills is OK.

Go to http://my.treway_dot_com/OKArt for more info!!!

 Hope to see you there!!!
