When you're scrounging for early VW parts in the local auto junkyards,
keep an eye out for VW waterpumpers, GTI specifically. The foam,
fat-grip steering wheel will fit a Thing and mid '70's beetles, big
improvement on skinny hard plastic. For listees, they have a nice panel
of 3 VDO guages. Celcius oil temp, volt meter and a clock. Haven't tried
the C guage yet, cause I already had a new F temp guage, but will try
and report back. I'll remove the clock (what's time to a vintage bus?)
and put in a Bus Depot supplied pressure guage and the volt meter will
fill the third hole. The plastic panel is angled so you can screw it to
the underside of the tray, perfect angle.
