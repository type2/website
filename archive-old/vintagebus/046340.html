&lt;&lt; OK, I went off the deep end for Christmas and bought myself a trip speedo. 
It 
 is perfect looking shows 40k miles and only needed the faded gels replaced 
 (which I did)  The problem is ... when I get close to 100 miles the 1 
 overturns by half a turn. It gets stuck halfway between 1 and 2, and stays 
 this way up through 300+ (haven't let it go any higher, I love resetting it)
 It's not really that big of a deal I can tell how many miles I've gone, I 
 just was curious if there is an easy fix to this. I don't really want to 
take 
 it apart to &quot;try and fix it&quot; Has anyone seen this problem?
 Thanks,

if you are really worried you can pay Hollywood Speedo or Palo Alto Speedo, 
each in that respective city in California, $100 to rebuild it for you.  They 
have been VDO dealers/fixers/whatevers, for decades. In fact somewhere I have 
an old price sheet from Palo Alto Speedo when they would sell you a new trip 
meter speedometer for what $9  ($4?)about 35 years ago.
