                      RE&gt;more on 36hp  :-(                         6/28/99

Did some more looking.  There isnt any play that I can get in the fly wheel, at least by tugging on the belt pully.  I did find out that I am only firing on  2 and 3.  I tried to play with switching wires a little and couldnt get 1 to ever hit.   I am going to put in new wires, plugs and do the tun-up stuff anyway so that is next.  What else would keep that no1. from hitting.  It was the cleaest plug when I pulled them.  Almost looked new, none of the rest where like that.
