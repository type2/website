&gt; I wondered what that sticky blue gunk was on the motor...Thanks George!
&gt; I went and picked up a brand new mexican motor for a bus that I'm working on
&gt; today...It was hauled via semi truck...so I went and met the driver at a local gas
&gt; station/truck stop.  He was in a hurry...so i opened up the bus and he opened his
&gt; trailer.  It was on or strapped to a pallet...I can't remember....but its on a
&gt; pallet in the bus right now.  He and I lifted it into the bus...it really wasn't
&gt; that bad.  I opened up the box to check for damage...no damage... good.  I sign the
&gt; papers and off he goes.  I drive home and inspect the engine further...and tote it
&gt; around to show off to all of my friends.  They like it.  I do too.  I pulled a
&gt; spark plug out of the head just to peer in there.  I thought these things were test
&gt; run?  The spark plug is absolutely clean.  There is oil in the case too...a little
&gt; low...but its in there.  The oil is clean as can be too.  I might pull a head off
&gt; just to peer in there and see what new stuff actually looks like :)

I don't think that the engines are test run.  They are factory engines
just like the ones that go into the cars, where they are tested.  In the
two engines I bought,
the only defect was a couple of dented pushrod tubes which haven't caused
any leakage so far.  This was definitely done at the factory, since the
carton was untouched.  Check yours before getting too far with assembly.

&gt; I like this motor...and wish it was mine...but it isn't.. oh well.   I ordered it
&gt; from Ronnie... decent delivery (that wasn't their fault that I live in a
&gt; residential area).. good price...and excellent service!  The only gripe I have is
&gt; that the new motors come with new doghouse oil coolers... but no adapters... what
&gt; gives?

they're intended to be replacements for existing dual port motors.  You're
expected to have an adapter already.  Next thing, you'll be complaining
about not getting a free set of doghouse tin!  :)

&gt; The casting flash isn't bad at all...and will only take a few minutes of filing.

Mine had very little flash.  Only place I had to deal with it was in the
head where the thermostat rod passes through.

&gt; I like how clean it is...everything is new and clean... I think I'll ahve to
&gt; repaint that oily tin just to make everything nice and clean inside.  An EMPI
&gt; degree pulley, and CB Performance Mini-Sump will compliment this engine too...maybe
&gt; some dual carbs eventually?  not my decision....not my engine.

Keep in mind that this is a low-compression engine desigened for Mexican
Nova (regular) grade gasoline.  It's a great utilitarian piece of
hardware, which is what I bought it for.  Performance folk will probably
want to do some internal mods before hanging those dual carbs on it.

Mine looks great with the stock pulley and sump.  I did switch to a sump
plate with a drain plug to make oil changes less exciting.

Unless you plan on doing something like autocrossing, deep sumps don't do
much for you.  In normal usage, the stock setup is better.

If you're drilling the hole for the thermostat stud, _don't_ drill a small
pilot hole first.  The pilot hole will allow the full-size bit to grab and
pull itself in too fast.  Just centerpunch the hole location and drill
with the full size bit the first time.

You'll also have to replace one stud on the top rear of the case parting
line with a longer stud to accomodate the dual port manifold.  You will
probably be able to pull the one out of the old engine unless some
gawdawful threadlocker was used on the old stud (&lt;blue word&gt; GEX &lt;blue
word&gt;&lt;blue word&gt;)
