Finding a nice bay window single cab for $1000 is hardly a crisis. I agree with Thom. At that price by the truck drive it around until you find your splitty and then sell your truck on e-bay for $10000. Just kidding. A nice bay single cab with everything working should bring around $2500 I would think. The bay window will drive better and be
smoother but there is no replacing the cool of a splitty. I made the same choice a while back only I all ready had the split. I picked up a real low mileage 71 Crew Cab (like 40,000 miles). It drove great. I still kept my 60 Crew Cab.
Good luck,
