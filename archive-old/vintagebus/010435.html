Speaking of which, I just stained one of my 2 BBTB shirts last night.  I was
a bit pissed that I got grease all over the sleeves but the overalls protect
the design.  You start to get this overall shaped clean spot on the shirt -
kind of like bras and tan lines.  I kind of like the stained clothes.  It's
a sign that says, &quot;Hey, he does his own work.  Boy isn't too bright for
wearing his good clothes while working on his stuff but by damned, he does
do his own work.&quot;
