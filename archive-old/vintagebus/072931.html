Subject: re:solder question(fuse box continued)

Was writ:
&quot;Is there more to soldering than just smearing the solder around on the two
pieces to be connected till it looks good?&quot;

I am not sure what the best way to do it is, but the way I do it is to use
some flux on the pars I am trying to solder together, then put the heat
source on one end, and the solder on the other...you want the piece to heat
the solder not the gun directly. The solder will work it's way to the
source.

I have just learned something about tinning the end of the gun, I guess for
a better connection?

I finished my fuse box job, and will test the lights tonight...I didn't
notice much difference in the daylight. I ended up using a 75 watt gun, as
that was most easily accessible to me (i.e. at the hardware store down the
street).

Headlight relay is probably the next option, although I think it may make
more sense to just convert to 12V, too many hoops to jump through with this
6V thing....
