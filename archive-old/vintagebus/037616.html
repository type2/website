Those 82mm cranks are somewhat common.

&lt;&lt; yesterday as i was planning for BBBIV, (bus content) i took apart the

2180cc that i had in my 68 baja and found an 82mm OKRASA counterweighted

crankshaft. journals are std/std, non-welded . i paid a guy 400$ for this

motor ten years ago. now if i stuff this classic crank into my &quot;stale air&quot;

40 hp, do i qualify as a guy big on vintage , or , a guy that has benn out

in the desert sun too long.
