&gt; &gt;&gt;This stuff almost matches the gold vinyl found in the late '60s-early
&gt; '70s Westfalia interiors.&lt;&lt;
&gt;
&gt; I found a good 30 yards of this stuff today, folks...
&gt;
&gt; It's not an exact match for the original, but it's the closest I've ever
&gt; seen.  Even has the faux-leather &quot;graining&quot; in it.  Has original-type
SNIP
&gt;
&gt; Price will be $6.50 per yard, 54&quot; bolt.  I have no idea how much it will
&gt; take, best get an upholsterer to look at the situation.  My best guess is
&gt; ten yards per van, but I'm an amateur at the upholstery biz.
&gt;

$6.50 a yard is a screaming good deal. I paid $20 a yard for some green
vinyl that closely approximated this stuff in everything but color. But
that was retail and special order.

My 67 westy kit took about 6 yards by a professional upholsterer. That
is for a bench ( my preference, and its not walk-thru envy) rear facing
seat and upright, z bed and rear cushion, and the armrest for the z-bed.
I did have them use a canvas for the bottom or the rear cushion for
better wear and to allow the air to go somewhere when my big but is
laying on the bed.

Pics of the kit still on my page from before the mex trip....
