Hi all
This past weekend I picked my Wife and Girls up at the airport, Returning
from 2 weeks stay in Florida.
I thought I'd get them excited a little, I had been talking of Buying a new
car,, and also thinking NEW BEETLE.. so i borrowed one for the weekend!
98 blue, new Beetle,, 50,000kms real clean,, nice car.

I amazed about some posts to the list.No offense, but who cares! Is this Bus 
content? Should I tell you a story about my little dog? I don't get it! Maybe 
we need 2 lists.
