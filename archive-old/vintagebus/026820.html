This is very true.  I have been a volunteer firefighter for about 15 years
now, and one of the first items brought up by my instructor in my first fire
suppression class was to make sure that I had at least an ABC fire
extinguisher in my bug.  He further explained and demonstrated why.  Although
the magnesium content in a vw engine isn't very high, it has just enough to
make a managable fire uncontrollable if treated with water.  Just about any
oxygen arresting substance will do.  He also demonstrated with a can of beer
shaken, not stirred.
