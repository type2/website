Years ago, I had a roof rack on the '56, and I'd put a gas can on top of it
for a surfing trip.  A couple nights later, at home, the gas can wandered
off.  So I went down to Target, bought the cheapest gas can they had, put a
couple cups of sugar in it and filled it with gas.  A couple nights later
it was gone...

I bet I could have repeated this trick ad nauseaum, until all of the local
yokels were on bicycles...
