The 59 double cab is still up in the air awaiting me to find those original
NOS or good used rubber grommets for all things underneath (so if you have
any of these types of things, let me know, hint hint).  Been traveling these
past few weeks so nothing has really been done except I fit the front bumper
on (mainly to get it out of the way).  A few new pics will be posted by the
end of the weekend or maybe Monday.  I have set the spring plates both at
5.5 degrees and have started to fit the axle tubes... the chromer still has
the bolts.

I've also decided to try and find a complete set of German door and window
seals so if you know where to get any of these items, again, let me know.

That Sept. 1 due date has been pushed to next spring with hopefully a debut
at the June (or before) Octo.... I guess it was a good thing I never really
said what year that Sept1 date landed in ;-)

Slowly but surely...
