Hey guys---
I'm going to Eugene, Oregon this weekend and was wondering if there are any 
neat vw places or junkyards in the near vicinity. I may have a few hours 
saturday and would love to check out some VW's or find some parts for my bus. 
Ahhh -- a good old visit to the University of Oregon. This will be my first 
visit to the PNW so i'm pretty excited.

Sorry for the minimal bus content---
