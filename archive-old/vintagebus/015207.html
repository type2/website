I recently ordered a tow bar made for busses that is just like the common
type for bugs only longer and with bigger front axle brackets.  I plan to
tow home a 23 window bus from my top secret junk yard.  ;-) Anyway, the
bus has no engine but does have a transmission.  I have heard that towing
a bus which has a transmission but no engine is not good on the
transmission.  Has anyone else heard of this?  Is it true and if so, how
does one tow without causing damage?  How does the bus track straight
behind the vehicle towing it without the wheels steering to one side or
the other on this type of tow bar?  Thanks for any help you can offer.
