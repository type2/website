All the splitties I've come across in junk yards have always been just mutilated...and it appears that people hack them up for fun.  They pull the motor, take it all apart, and leave it on the ground (complete, all pieces there) behind the bus.  Or they'll bring their cordless sawzall and go to town, cutting big pieces off the bus only to shove them inside or leave them on the ground.  I don't understand it...
