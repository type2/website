&gt; The splitty took around 36 HP to do this. Kind'a neet how

&gt; WOT in fourth gear without damage.

Now the question is how much engine do you have crammed into your splitty? I
run a 1600 dp with stock carb and distributor in my 65 standard.  This is more
than 36 hp no?  I don't feel comfortable running WOT with more engine than my
bus was originally designed for.  How much damage is potentionally being done
to my tranny and reduction boxes?

Food for thought...
