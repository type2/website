&gt; greetings...
&gt; i am putting some sounds in the bus this spring and am wondering how much my
&gt; 12V generator can handle. im sick of the mini, cigarette lighter powered
&gt; AIWA cassette player dangling off the dashboard! i wanted to get a cd head
&gt; unit, but a friend warned that the 100watts or so that they put out may be
&gt; too much.
&gt;
&gt; what kind of radios do y'all have running on your stock 12V buses?

Unless you are running truly ear-shattering volumes, you won't have any
complaints from your generator.  Even thoughthe stereo is rated at 100W,
it will not draw nearly that much at normal listening levels.
