Subject: [VB] Listee stickers?


&gt; Hey everyone....I hope this isn't considered a friday topic...but here
goes.
&gt;
&gt; While washing the back window of the bus yesterday, I got to thinking
about
&gt; the old v_at_l sticker Crusty Van Bondage had put on the 63EZ before I bought
it.
&gt;
&gt; I really enjoy meeting new listees at the shows...but since there are so
many
&gt; of us, and no real way of recognition, I'm thinking of this-
&gt; Would there be any interest from the listees on a small simple window
sticker
&gt; stating 'vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com' or something to that effect??
&gt; Something visible enough to see in a bus back window.
&gt; I have a friend who can make vinyl stickers for me and for real cheap.  I
was
&gt; planning to sell them at shows for cost and maybe a buck or two to go the
&gt; list fund.
&gt;
&gt; If there is interest, then I can have a batch made and take them to the
OCTO
&gt; show.....and we can see if this flies.
&gt;
&gt; ADMINS:I checked the archives and list rules.....It seems like this should
be
&gt; ok ....am I correct?
&gt;
&gt; Let me know..and I'll get to it.
