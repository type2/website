Subject: Re: [VB] Stock tranny source?

I've got a freeway flyer in my '67 right now, and it's currently running a
1600sp.  My opinion would be that unless you live in a very mountainous
region of the country, go with a freeway flyer.  The 1600sp does fine for
motivating a bus with a freeway flyer, but I wouldn't try with anything
smaller than a 1600.  Good luck.

&gt; I'll need to be able
&gt; to bolt up a 12v motor, which is a 1600sp so I don't think a freeway flyer
&gt; is such a good idea for me (?opinions?).  Just looking for a good stock
&gt; rebuild, hopefully w/nosecone - from the docs I think I can handle the
&gt; axle r&amp;r.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Joe
