Subject: Re: Selling your bus

I had a really nice '66 13 window walk-thru in my twenties while in
college. Even though it was just ten years old it required regular
maintenance and more, and I spent more time under it than I did on top
of my GF. It was a great bus, reliable once I fixed a few things, and
fun for my Great Dane to ride in--he'd stand or sit between the front
seats and watch the road along with me. I traded it in on a '72 VW 411
for speed and a gas heater, which I later gave to a friend. It lasted
until his very obese wife drove it once and it caught fire. (The
battery is under the driver's seat on that model.) After dabbling with
three Beetles (I have only one now, a rough '56), I returned to my true
love, The Microbus, last year. I found it on eBay and I payed 15 times
what I got on trade-in for my '66 in 1978. See the thread &quot;Back in a
bus after 30 years&quot; for more details. Also &quot;Back under a bus after 30
years&quot;.

My advice is also to keep your Bus, in long-term storage if you must,
until you are ready to use it. If you know there are problems, fix them
one at a time as finances permit. If I had the foresight to keep my
'66, and keep it in the state I had it when I traded it in, I would be
a lot of money ahead and I would have had a real LT relationship with a
vehicle rather than a series of brief hook-ups with watercoolers that
left me with no lasting memories. 

So, if you can possibly swing it, keep it! 

Good luck,
Richard
