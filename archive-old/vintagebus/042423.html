&gt; I've heard various suggestions of attaching the bell housing from an

&gt; you do that without having the entire transmission housing hanging out
&gt; there, or doing an awful lot of cutting through thick metal.

I am going to grab me an autostick bellhousing...(know where there is one
cheap.)

it unbolts and then you just have that...

another option is a 68-74 bus bellhousing... uses the same starter
flywheel diam etc. as a t1.. and it unbolts from the tranny.
