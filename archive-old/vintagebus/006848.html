they the ones buying buses now

Ronnie

actually the rich wanabes moved on when the values of Porches took a major
dump, lost over half there inflated values in less then a year, so as the
prices of our commodities go through the roof in no time at all will they
fall back to earth.
(then they will no longer be a commoditie and will return to hippie statue) 

Then all the bus restorers will move onto the next crave wave, start buying
up those early Rabbits.

Ronnie


.   How many people who used to
be in the 356 hobby were still in it when the values (real or imagined) went
to
50K + ?   The rich ones that's who.
