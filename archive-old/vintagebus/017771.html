This morning on the way out to work the bus died electrically.  Lights
off, engine off, all quiet.  I thought the battery cable was to blame as
it's been acting flakey lately, but I just finished putting a new one on
and nothing! 

Facts: 1 - Battery good.  2 - Fuse box has a hot lead from the battery. 
3 - I'm tired, but I need to drive the bus tomorrow. 

Where should I be looking?
