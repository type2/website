&gt; With a load, my 1776 that is dual webered, freeway flyer trans, and tall 15&quot;

&gt; know if I went to 14&quot; tires it would help but with any kind of load or even
&gt; pulling a trailer, I would suffer.  I still think that for a workaholic bus,
&gt; a T4 2L is going to be the ticket.

I love to modify busses, and think its fun :)

But, having just come back from a vacation to New Mexico and spending a
lot of time in the mountains, i have come to a different conclusion on
trannies than i once had (though my engine being tired &amp; now dead may skew
my ideas...)

Build a counterweighted engine that can take high revs and run lower gears
so hills dont slow you down.

One of the things i liked _best_ about my 61 was that with the small nut
and a 1600 it went up all but the steepest hills at the same speed as flat
ground. I felt comfortable revving it to about 65 mph (probably a little
fast for 3000 rpm fanatics, but do-able)

Now i have a big nut tranny in my bus with 15's i thought it was a 67, but
it has a 6v bushing hole so im confused, its probably a 66 i think.

Anyway, hills phase me a lot more, inb the mountains it was a real chore.

Now, my engine is tired, so im going to build a new one before i change
back to small nut, but i now believe that any bus should be geared as low
as humanly possible while still maintining an acceptable RPM at cruising
speed. A compromise like most things in life....

I have decided the quest for ever taller gears is not for me, low
end driveability suffers too much and you dont gain that much on the high
end (hell you loose on the high end going uphill.  Whats the point of
going 70 downhill and 50 uphill all day for an average of 60 when you
could have just built a lower geared transmission and saved all that damn
shifting.... i just basically did that for the last two weeks and its for 
the birds...)

But the jury is out until i get a fresh motor in and a tach to see what
_exactly_ is going on. (maybe even some temp/pressure gagues!)

Just MHO's and etc.

take care,

Steve

p.s. i'd say i believe 67 trnnies are for 14's with stock tires... 64-66
Might be good for both, and small nut is ideal for 15's but im a wierd
one. I will no longer consider anything taller than a 67 (4.12 r&amp;p &amp; 1.29
redux boxes..) for anything (unless i go get some low profile tires,
heh) I'd even run a 67 box with a 2 liter... who really wants to go faster
than 70 in a split anyways...
