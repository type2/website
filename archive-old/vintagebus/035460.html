&gt;      I am back with another question for the list hopefully it is an easy
&gt;  one. I just received a steering box out of a 65 bus that is from a company
&gt;  called Ross (pn: 6222010139). Is this a common steering box or one of those
&gt;  rare after market companies that made steering boxes.  I would like to
&gt;  install it in my 67 bus but I am not sure if there is any difference 
between
&gt;  65 and 67. It appears to be in good shape and I was just curious if this 
was
&gt;  a common steering box. One other thing is there anyone selling the steering
&gt;  box gears to rebuild thes


a 65 and 67 steering box is interchangable.  Sounds like that pn is not VW, 
so no idea what it means.  Wolfgang in Redding CA does rebuild SG boxes
