 Hi everyone,.. I installed the 36hp this morning, and have a few questions,
 -Would it be &quot;correct&quot; for all my engine electrical hook ups to be screw
 terminal? including the voltage regulator?
.............
yes- in 1960 I believe they got push on terminals,  all the 36hp buses were 
screw terminals.  

 -The accelerator cable doesn't seem to return, I think I may have kinked the
 cable, is it possible to straighten it?
  &gt;&gt;
do you have that three piece return spring in between the carb  and the fan 
shroud on the accelerator cable?    has a spring, a cuptube, and a little 
holder clip thing that lets the spring press angainst the holdon to the carb 
part of the cable.    you can also add a spring under the front of the bus at 
the pedal area front of cable.  I had to mess with this stuff having a foot 
on my westy.  If you have a foot you need more springage
