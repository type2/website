In a message dated 98-08-17 16:29:31 EDT, you write:

&lt;&lt; 
 When test-fitting all the pieces on the engine for my 58 (dual relief
 case from a 74 bug, bored out for 90.5 P&amp;C), I've noticed that the
 cylinders fit into the case and into the heads very loosely.  Enough so
 that I can rock them to and fro just a bit.  
 
 Is this normal?  Is it because of the different expansion/contraction
 rates of the metal?  Just looking for some reassurrance before I
 continue. &gt;&gt;
Hi Mike,
That does not sound good, the stock engines we run have a definite tightness
when the cylinders are in place to keep them from shimming around while the
engine is running.  You also might want to check that there is a radius to the
bottom of the bore in the case for the bigger cylinders you are going to use.
Radius in the corner of this bore will spread out the stress on the now weaker
case and hopefully keep especially #3 cylinder from cracking through to the
front of the case.  No radius means the chances of having a oil leaking crack
are really good.   Eric &amp; Barb
