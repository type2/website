&gt;Here is an easy question for those of you who have done it before... I have a
&gt;stack of worn deluxe trim and would like to polish it myself.  I tried the
&gt;steel wool on a fewe pieces but it doesn't shine as much as pieces I've seen
&gt;around.( I don't own a large buffing wheel ) What yields the best results?
&gt;Also If anyone knows of a pair of early front bumper trim pieces I've got a
&gt;pocket full of cash for a trade. Thanks Trevor

I too have been polishing the trim for my 58 deluxe.  I had to get a 1/8&quot; deep
by 1.5&quot; long gash out of one of the rear bumper trim pieces.  I did that by
first sanding the trim with 220 grit sand paper.  Next I put a pumice wheel on
my dremel tool and reshaped the grove in the center of the trim.  More sanding
to feather the differences in height of the aluminum and finally lots of steel
wool in various grades.  I spent about 45 minutes doing the final rubbing of
the trim with 0000 grade of steel wool.  Lastly I polished the trim with
simichrome polish.  I spent about 6 hours on one rear bumper trim, it looks
great, almost like chrome.  I figure that I can't replace the trim on the 58
very easily, so I had better learn how to polish out the gouge.  
I also got a huge blister on my thumb, not a planned thing, but I guess it was
worth it.  I expect to have all the trim polished by the time my bus gets out
of the shop.  I have had the bus for over 10 years, I guess I should have
started polishing long ago.  The bus is at a list members shop.  To see it or
to check its progress click on the link.
