Subject: Re: [VB] New Toyota

Like Porsche - about ready to debut an expensive as hell
SUV in the face of a huge recession, while other carmakers 
are coming up with kinds of schemes to squeeze cars out the door.
PCNA got spanked by PAG for sending out $1000 off Boxster coupons
to the entire PCA membership.  The used 996 market has all
but collapsed, with even '00MY cars having lost 50% of their
value.  Mid-high mileage 993's can be had for the upper 20's now,
which were north of $80k new!

&gt; Maybe VW will take the hint and follow suit as most auto manufacturers do .
&gt; But they are VERY slow bringing cars to market, I mean look at them, they
&gt; are just NOW coming out with an SUV as the goverment is ready to clamp down
&gt; on them, forward thinking!!
