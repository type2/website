&gt; It has been suggested that the closest correct color match powder coat for
&gt; silver white should be either:
&gt; Traffic White (RAL 9016)
&gt; or
&gt; Signal White (RAL 9003)

I did my rims in Signal White.
I think that it's too bright and not
really a close match. If your looking for
dead on, it's not it. If I were to do it over
I would try to color match to an original piece
of bumper or wheels. Yeah it's more expensive to do
it that way, but the correct color looks better.
Just my $.02.
