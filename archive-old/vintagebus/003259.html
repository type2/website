The Westfailure has backwards scoops. Does it do anything? Well, sort of. It
makes people want to come up to me at gas stations and shows and the like
and warn me that I'm going to burn up my engine if I don't turn them back
around tootsweet. Ain't nothing in there but a fuel tank and batteries,
engine located elsewhere. Not a huge amount of entertainment, but a little
bit. Kind of a smirk, not really a full giggle.

&gt; i was looking through some of my internet vw pics
&gt; today and i saw a bus in the background that looked
&gt; like it had the scoops on backwards! does this make
&gt; sense to anyone? would this really do anything?
