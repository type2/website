Subject: Re: [VB] Double Cab Bed Floors, and Double Cab parts Help.

Further checking reveals that the 64 single has the hole and plug in the
pod, no light in the fixture holes. The 57 has the light holes, no hole in
the pod. Looks like the break may be at the end of pointy speedo pods? Looks
like we need to get some info from the 61 to 63 trucks to nail it down.

&gt; I should have realized by now that when it comes to Type 2s, never
&gt; assume anything.  So if my second dome light with speedo pod switch was
&gt; not a factory issue item (as it now appears), I'm wondering whether it
&gt; was part of some other M-code or just a dealer-installed option like the
&gt; radio?
