Subject: (early?) double cab rear seat hold down

Hi All,

Well, off line, I've been talking with Steve Harris (62 DC) and John Yost
(two 65 DCs).  It seems that John's 65 double cabs have no hold downs on the
floor for the rear seat pedestal.  Steve's 62 has both.  My 59 has the
mounts for the carriage bolt head on the floor.  Anyone else care to add to
this discussion as per what year it might have changed?

see this page for a picture of the hold down:

During these discussions, I remembered a carriage bolt and wing nut with a
funny looking metal plate on it that I picked up from someone earlier (my dc
didn't have these when I got it but did have the two on the rear cab
wall)... I really only need the metal plate but would take the bolt and
wingnut as well if someone's got it.  I'd be willing to trade a nice pair of
rear seat clamps for a regular bus seat for the one bolt/plate/nut set... or
name the price and I'll buy it from you.  Bring it to Octo and we can all
save on shipping!

This list is bitchin!... have a thought/question and it gets worked out!

David
