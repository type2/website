 I always figured that VW bus owners and Harley riders got to know each other 
 from always being on the side of the road fixing their rides ........
 
 or was it the oil spots marking their turf ?

I got my 65 westy from a guy who had loads of VWs, and looked like yr old 
biker with long beard and hair and worn leather and big beer gut and even his 
dog wore something that said Harley Davidson on it.  Real nice guy.  Don't 
think many (any?) of his VWs ran, but his bike did.
