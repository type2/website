This is an excerpt from a post that I made to the vintagevw list.  It
pertains to us bus owners as well.

I've been working on fixing up a set of 5 lug 15&quot; rims for my 1966 bus.
I've had first hand experience now with getting set of rims sandblasted and
then
finding out the they did a piss poor job of it so I took my Harbor Freight
special and finished the job.  Needless to say, my work is better than
theirs (nanny nanny poo poo nyaaaa!!!)

Back to the hubcap clips.  There is a tool that VW used for holding the
domed or flat end of the rivet on the cubcap clip.  It was like a long
tapered metal cone with a cutout in the side to prevent the clip from
interfering with it.  Since I don't have this tool, my trusty Grandfather
and machinist mentor came up with an idea which as usual, worked very well.

We put the rivet in the clip and through the hole in the rim.  Then we
clipped the rivet on the backside with a visegrip to prevent it from falling
out.  Using a piece of barstock (metal bar) approx. 8 inches long, 2 inches
wide, and about an 1/8&quot; thick in a bench vise, we flipped the rim upside
down and put the rivet head right on the end of the barstock (my grandfather
was holding the rim.)  We then made sure the clip was centered and pushed
down all the way on the rim.  Next we removed the visegrip.  Using the ball
end of a ballpeen hammer, I carefully tapped around the end of the rivet
which was now sticking up out of the hole a good 1/16&quot; or so.  25 times we
repeated this scenario, carefully tapping in a circle around the rivet with
an occasional blow to the center to flatten things out.  Using a piece of
tin with a straight edge, I dragged it over the top of the rivet to make
sure it was recessed down low enough so as to avoid interference with the
brake drum.

I misdrilled a couple of the old rivets and the holes were kind of wallowed
out.  I installed the clip anyway and then carefully took the mig welder
tonight and tack welded the back side of the rivet in while I clamped things
securely in place with the vise grip.  Using a grinder, I was able to recess
the rivet head against the rim.  Gotta love those mig welders.  I've found a
that a test slab of metal works great to fine tune a mig before doing the
actual weld.  This way you can coordinate the power and feed which are the
keys to a good seat of the pants welding job.

Finally, my rims are ready to powdercoat!

Thanks for reading....
