(!) Does it say that? That magazine is not on the newsstand here yet (I
happened to check this morning). To this day I do not know what an Eriba
Puck trailer even IS. &lt;

All,
        I am sure that they meant to say that Ken's &quot;Efforts of
maintiaining the list&quot; were instrumental in Jim Ellis finding the Puck. 
Or...maybe they confused their notes with how Ken's &quot;Efforts&quot; were helpful
in the actual &quot;RFH&quot; Westy.  Anyway you look at it, Mr. Ellis was giving Ken
credit for being there for us ALL that time.  We cant expect the &quot;T&amp;A
(which I like, BTW) rags&quot; to be as accurate as the almighty lists.

        Thanks again, Ken!
