flooring ????

do not use pergo....that stuff is real crap, and does not hold up well to
water unless installed perfectly, and in a bus with vibration the seams are
bound to open up and end your perfect installation...sheet vinyl is the way to
go-no seams, you should be able to find it at any flooring place that has
vinyl...the trick is finding affordable stuff that looks good. Mine was
originally laminated to masonite...
