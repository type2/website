Subject: Re: [VB] Stock tire size

&gt;I have been looking for tires for my 65 deluxe.  I have been thru the
&gt;archives and have not found what i was looking for so i ask:
&gt;
&gt;I seams to me like 185/70 R14 was the closest thing to the original 7.00
&gt;R14.  Given that, what tires have you all found (brand etc.) that have
&gt;looked correct/good on a all stock bus?  I do not what to go with
&gt;bias-ply and do not want white walls.
&gt;
&gt;Any input out there?


For the hundredth time, 185/70-14 is TOO SMALL.

Here is my complete(?) size info.  Load ranges are up to you.

The plot thickens!  It turns out that the European sized metric tires, like
a 185SR14 for example, do not have an 80% aspect ratio, but 82% or 83% (I
forget which, but I think it's 82%).  This changes things just a bit.  I've
added the Euro spec tires to the list of acceptable 14&quot; and 15&quot; sizes for
buses.


Bentley says that the 3/4 ton (small nut) models came with a 6.40-15 tire,
having a diameter of 27.16&quot;, +/- .24&quot;.

This makes the nearest European radial tire size a 185R15

Good luck getting most of these on the back.  I've gotten some big tires on
the back of an old bus by letting the air out while wedging the tire
between the drum and the body lip, and then refilling it after getting the
wheel bolted up.



One ton (big nut) models came with 7.00-14 tires, having a diameter of
26.22&quot;, +/- .24&quot;.

This makes the nearest radial tire size a 195R14
