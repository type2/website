ALOT of Japanese exporters are buying then here, shipping them, and restoring 
them to Japan.
Dont forget how expensive labor is in L.A.
Probably the most expensive right behind N.Y. and S.F.
Thats probably why parts are so expensive here.

&lt;&lt;If this guy is the same Japanese guy who bought my buddy Eric's original 
Westy then he restores them in Cali...I think he said Hunt. Beach and the 
ships 'em to Japan for resale.
He bought my bud's 67 Westy for 10K....nice bus but a little steep...Ronnie 
saw it.
Picked it up within hours of calling about the bus ad.
