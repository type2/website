Look at the prices of the American iron, half of those cars there are usally
junked around here, I could get the American iron for half of what I pay for
some of the buses I&quot;ve had, then I could sell those to Japan or trade to get
some of the buses back here. The 2 owner Westy looks like the one Eric of
Las Vegas sold to Japan last year for $9500.00 plus.
