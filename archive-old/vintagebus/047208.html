Hi Harry,
FYI just in case.  The 1962-63 door handles seem to have a differant base to
them compared to the pre-1962 handles.  Since the 1962-63 doors only have
that recess just around the exterior handle base, using the earlier handles
results in the forward handle tips hitting the sheet metal and doing what you
do not want to your paint job.  Eric&amp;Barb
