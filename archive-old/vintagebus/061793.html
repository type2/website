Subject: Re: [VB] open deck lid for better cooling?

Akin's First Law:  Engineering is done with numbers. Analysis without 
numbers is only an opinion.*

And how did he measure this 25 deg F reduction? and where? Oil temp? 
Cylinder head temp? Passenger compartment temp? Driver's temp because 
instead of sitting in the hot sun he got to sit in GEX's air conditioned 
waiting room waiting for a new motor? ;o)

If opening the engine cover made it run cooler, VW would have redesigned 
the engine cover to be open. (Like they did with the later model Beetles 
when they added the new, additional louvers on the deck lid.)

I hate to be the bearer of bad news, I don't think your friend knows 
what he's talking about.

I could be wrong, but until I see some numbers off calibrated 
instruments collected by doing repeatable tests, I'm *really* skeptical....

Jim

&gt; Some of my beetle freinds use a tennis ball to to prop the deck lid open a couple of inches when they run on the hiway. They all swear that it decreases the temp 25 degrees . anyone try this on a type 2, if so did it make a difference?
