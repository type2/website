Subject: Buses By the Beach - Bus Boo is Coming up!

WOOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!! 

 

It's almost time for everyone to be together again at &quot;BUS BOO!&quot; Buses By
the Beach annual fall campout an Halloween before Halloween party in Grand
Rapids, MI Sept. 14th, 15th &amp; 16th. It looks like we are in for another
great turn out of Bus Pilots and VW lovers from all over the country. So
bring your musical instruments for some campfire jamin'. Remember, it's not
about sounding good, just feeling good!

 

If you have not made reservations please call the campground so we can plan
for camping space. Call Grand Rogue at 1-616-361-1053 located at 6400 West
River Drive, Belmont, MI 49306. Make sure you tell them that you are with
Buses By the Beach group so they can group us all together.

New this year will be a &quot;family friendly&quot; camping area that will have a
quiet hour of 9pm. If you are interested make sure you let them know when
you check in. 

 

Back by popular demand, we are camping during the West Michigan Living
History and Educational Association presentation of Early America Encampment
at Grand Rogue Campground. Visitors can view first hand what life in early
America was like. There will be period craftsmen demonstrating their skills,
including a blacksmith and a woodworker. Working with hand tools, they show
how everyday implements were made in early America. At the Encampment,
history buffs wearing authentic period clothing and living in period
shelters, present programs throughout the weekend. Activities will include
musket and cannon firing, men's and women's period fashion shows and
tactical demonstrations. For more information on the Early American
