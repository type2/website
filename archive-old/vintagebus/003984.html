Finding them is the easy part. My worst problem I've had is *convincing* the
og owner that they owned it!  Showin them the DMV paperwork with their name
all over it and they deny for hours, mind warped from foriegn substances in
their head years ago........

&gt;who the (deceased) father bought it from,
