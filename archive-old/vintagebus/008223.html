&gt; Guys:
&gt;
&gt; I would probably be benficial PR for you to post to vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com
&gt; that we've resolved the differences and that I will be attending.
&gt; Otherwise they're all going to think I'm still not going.  Why should you
&gt; post it and not me?  If you post it, it's a chance to show that you're
&gt; involved in the process in good faith.   If I post it, it might seem like
a
&gt; &quot;so there!&quot; victory-dance kind of post.
&gt;
&gt; Just a suggestion.
