Subject: Re: [VB] Roundness of the cooling fan

Dear list,

Thanks to all who donated advice.  Replacing the fan made all the
difference.  No more ugly vibration or resonance.  The engine hums like
a sewing machine.  A true pleasure to drive now.  I could see no crack
in the fan's hub but it was misshapen somehow with a very noticeable
wobble that was easy to see once I got it out.

Thanks again to you all.  This list is a wonderful resource.
