Subject: Re: [VB] shiftrod rusted to tube

Hm, I was assuming that the rod was rusted to the tube where the rod broke.

Yes heat the tube.   This should heat the tube and the rod.   May make the 
paint ugly where you heat it up, but it probably is anyway.

 &gt;After a few round of heat it up/quench it to break the rust free, I'd try a
 &gt;hammer and drift.
 
 So, heat the tube? 'cause I can't get at the rod really. In fact, I'm 
 not positive exactly where it's &quot;rust-welded&quot; together.
