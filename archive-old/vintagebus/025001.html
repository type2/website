Hey Volks,

just wanted to say the list is great.

need to replace a couple of wheel bearings on the 66 std.
is there any particular book that will outline this job well?
also, should I do all four while I'm in there?

on top of that I've a leaking nose cone bushing which is a
big jobber I know, but the same q&amp;a  goes for that as well...
