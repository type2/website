Ronnie,
Your right on the over tightening, that can wreck Generator bearings as well.

I've used that same belt for years and have had no problems with them until 
the last few months. I was thinking more of a bad batch of materials in the 
belts, or a change in materials that might cause the problem. 
After the belt loosens I take one shim out and get the correct deflection, 
50-100 more miles and it's loose and flapping around. I was just wondering if 
anyone else has had this problem in Contitech belts purchased and installed 
in the past 6 months or so. The Kelly Springfield notched belt I put on is 
doing fine with no stretch out problem, it seems to have a more balanced spin 
than the Contitech. I'll switch the other Contitech belts with Gates or Kelly 
and see what happens.

 10,000 plus out of the belts, the problem I seem to encounter is people over
 tightening the belt on installation.
