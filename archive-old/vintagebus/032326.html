but you didn't say where you got the idea that VW designed these to be driven 
at WOT.

If so, how do you explain the rev limiters that came on the motors some years 
(VW installed on new cars, not the berg edition)?

I don't think Taylor posted his WOT speed (at least 65), but that he kept it 
to about 60, as he felt the bus was more comfortable at that speed than 
driving as fast as possible, ie that he didn't want to drive WOT 

I could easily overrev the 59 truck I had ( 40hp motor, 4.37 r&amp;p with 1.39 
RGs) and push over 4K in 4th.  3K was about 47 mph, it liked maxing out about 
52/53- about 3500, 3600, .  Above that it didn't sound happy,  though I could 
easily push it over 4K

not that I wanted to pass only 1 vehicle in 800 miles, but rather not burn 
the motor into the ground.

&lt;&lt; Many ask for my source. Fair enough.
 
 Taylor's original question was:
 
  &quot;On the freeway I really don't take it much over
 60...sounds like it's running too high at 65. Can anyone
 give me some numbers?&quot;
 
 Mike has contributed to the thread and posted that:
 
 &quot;I make about 67 MPH (tested to be accurate) at about 4000
 RPM with 26.5&quot;
 diameter tires and I know I have (or at least paid for) a
 4.125 R&amp;P and that
 pretty much corresponds to the speed/rev table that was
 posted.&quot;
 
 If I read his post correctly, even with a 1776 and dual
 40's, he still finds his top speed limited to 67 mph _at_4Krpm.
 I believe everything he wrote; I've had the same experience.
 
 If all Mike can pull is 67mph _at_4Krpm in 4th, I think my
 point is made. Will anyone argue that 4Krpm is to high for
 freeway driving? And in 4th gear he can't seem to do any
 better;&lt;) Has anyone on the list got a split that can pull
 5Krpm in 4th? I don't believe it can be done with a stock
 setup.
 
 The source for the rpm limiters is the BERG '96 catalogue,
 pg. 87-88. They recommend a 5.8Krpm cutout for all T2s
 because of &quot;low gear ratios.&quot; He claims that he had a 50%
 increase in head life using a 5,850rpm limiter in his T2.
 
 BENTLEY lists the 1500 engine as having an output of SAE 51
 bhp _at_4Krpm as the maximum output. Exactly the limit Mike
 found.
 
 BENTLEY lists the 1200 40hp using a 4.125R/P W/1.39RG as
 yielding 60mph _at_3.6Krpm as the top road speed using 26&quot;
 tires. The 1500 51hp using a 4.125R/P W/1.26RG gets 68mph
 _at_3.8Krpm. Using the 4.375R/P, 65mph _at_4050rpm.
 
 So even a stronger engine will not make you go any faster.
 You can there quicker, but you don't go no faster. 
 
 I stand by my opinion.
