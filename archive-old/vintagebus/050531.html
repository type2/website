Subject: Type 4 upright cooling

  I am looking at doing a type 4 conversion in my 65 13 window.My big 
question is how necessary is it to convert to upright cooling?I have seen 
splits in pics that werent and it looks like the only thing that had to be 
reworked was the rear valence?The bus is going to be pretty custom so I am 
not real worried about it looking original,and yes I will be getting rid of 
the rgbs.Any advice would be appreciated.and please no comments from the 
Vintage Nazi's!
