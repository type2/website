Subject: My 65 Bus in OKC

Well, let me answer here since otherwise I would have to write to each and
every one that responded. Well Isaiah, Chad, others, it was my Bimmer that
was stolen. My Ford is still in my garage. I'm loosing my mind over this and
have been really badly hurt after I saw what those bastards did to my car.
Not only that they stripped some parts off it they burned the rest to cover
their tracks. SOB's I tell you. I was going on October 28th to pick up my
&quot;new&quot; purchased bus from OKC from Larry Terry. Some of you probably know the
guy. I have got pretty good response from the guys that wanted to bail me
out of this one since I even posted a deposit with Larry. I might need a few
days to think things over. I'm not all there yet. Give me a few days, I
might call Larry to talk to him about it. If anything you'll be the first
ones I will talk to. There's still a chance I'll go and get it since I have
started work on an engine for this Bus.

Thanks for understanding and your kind words.

Andre
