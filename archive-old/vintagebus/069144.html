Subject: Re: [VB] Snap ring pliers

stop by a local shop and ask the guys which day the snap on or mac guy comes
there.  then you can just catch the guy at his truck to buy or exchange
tools.  a good tool guy should be pretty consistent.  the mac guy comes to
our shop every wednesday at about noon and snap on comes friday at 3:30ish.

&gt; Volks,
&gt;
&gt; Talk of Snap-on and Mac.  I don't doubt they are superior tools to
Craftsman.
&gt; BUT, for the hobbyist, it isn't practical to buy them.  Ever try to find a
&gt; salesman?  Oh, you do, every once in a while.  You pass them on the road
or
&gt; spot them at a mechanics shop.  Big ole trucks full of tools. drool.  BUT,
if
&gt; you happen to get a salesman and buy some tools, how do you get broken
ones
&gt; replaced?  Sears and Craftsman, they are everywhere.  I can remember in
the
&gt; 60's they carried very few metrics in the stores.
