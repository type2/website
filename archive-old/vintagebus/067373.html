Subject: Major Bus bummer

  I bought this bus a couple months ago and the guy finally dug it out from
being buried deep in the wrecking yard, I called today to see the progress
of getting it out and he said it was out, BUT, when he was getting it out
the bucket on the loader SMASHED the roof!!!!!!!!! I am still going to get
it but now the ORIGINAL paint, NO RUST 15 window delux has a smashed roof
O-well!!
