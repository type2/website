&gt; &lt;&lt; Not even sure if anybody out there knew there was a SOTO show today
down
&gt;  in the San Diego area, but there was, if you can call it a show.   I
&gt;  happened to be down in the area visiting my parents, so I decided to
&gt;  drive by.  They might have had something in the swap I needed.
&gt;
&gt;  Well, as I drove up at about 11 am, I thought that I must have got the
&gt;  dates wrong...where was everyone?  As I got closer, I saw 3 maybe 5
&gt;  busses....that was it!!  There was a EZ up set up at the entrance
&gt;  waiting for the throngs that never came.  I didn't even bother to
&gt;  stop...it was pathetic!  I think this signals the end of them at least
&gt;  down here in the South.
&gt;
&gt;  Long live OCTO!

&gt;      I heard about it but I had a real busy day cleaning out my sock
drawer.
&gt; I'll definitely will be at the O.C.T.O. show
&gt;

I live about 10 minutes from the winery where the SOTO meet was held.   I
was there at 8:30 AM to avoid the crowd.  I guess there was a total of about
15 to 20 busses at the peak of the event which was about 9:30 AM.  When the
members of the San Diego chapter of SVII's took off for the VW drags at
Carlsbad raceway, the bus population was cut in half at the SOTO meet.

I personally had a good time however.  Had my pick of shady parking and I
got to talk to Charlie Hammil for a while about bus pieces and parts.  It is
always a pleasure talking to someone who is an expert on a subject.  As for
the OCTO meet on the 24th of Oct., Charlie told me he is hoping to have 100+
busses attend.  I'll bet there will be even more.

See you at OCTO!
