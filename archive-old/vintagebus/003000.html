&gt;The center section bolt up for the nose cone is the same for any split case
&gt;tranny- which means with you putting a tunnel case one in you need to keep
&gt;the adapter stuff from the one you are removing.
&gt;
But does a tunnelcase Bus nosecone mount differently than a Bug one?  I'd
hate to pull out the existing Bug rear end to replace it with a Bus
assembly, only to find I can't use the existing Bug nosecone custom mount.

&gt;Brakes- well yes the brakes from a 66 bus are much bigger than the rear of
&gt;a barndoor.   The barndoor takes the same wheel cylinders on the back as
&gt;on the front of oval window bugs, and the front are barndoor only.
&gt;The brake shoes are the same all the way round on Barndoors.   So you
&gt;will be putting bigger brakes on the front than the back.
&gt;
Is that last sentence reversed?  Shouldn't that be &quot;larger on the back than
the front&quot;?  As a refresher, the situation was putting big-nut brakes (9.8&quot;)
on the back with front Barndoor (9.0&quot;?) brakes.  Are small-nut brakes (9.0&quot;
also?) suitable for the back instead?  I was unable to find the exact size
of Barndoor front drums in my shop manual...

Thank you,
Everett Barnes
