Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [VB] Dead mouse removal?

&gt; &gt; Any suggestions for getting the bugger out?

Just a warning, remember a year or so ago when others had this problem?  At
that time people warned of certain diseases or germs that the mouse nests and
bodies carried.  I would be concerned about this if your bus is any where near
air tight.  Fortunately mine isn't even close.  It only sucks in the
winter.....:(
