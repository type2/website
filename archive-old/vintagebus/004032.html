I just got back from a tile warehouse, where I was picking up
950 sq. ft. of ceramic tile for my basement.Of course I went in my 64
bus.When I got to the warehouse the guys in the shipping department laughed
at my bus and said &quot;Looks like you'll be making several trips&quot;.Well, I had
planned on making two trips ,but they kept up the insulting remarks for
quite a while.So I decided to load my bus as far as it would go.There was
3285
pounds of tile!! I knew this was way past the maximun load of the bus but my
ego kicked in and I kept loading her until all the tile was in the bus.The
two guys came back out to see how I was doing and could NOT believe the bus
could move under that much weight.I waved and chuckled as I left with them
in my rearview mirror slack jawed ! I guess i got the last laugh .I didn't
have far to go and the ride was easier than I thought .My only worry was a
flat tire.Made it home just fine and unloaded her.
I seemed to have a harder time than my bus.I am not suggesting to do this,
but I felt I had something to prove to these
Ch#vy loving fools.
    Also saved me $200 delivery charge !
