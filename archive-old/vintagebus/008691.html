Subject: Anyone near Newark OH ???

Hi Everyone,
  Is there anyone near Newark OH, that could look at a bus for me?? The bus
is a 66' Sundial, and is located very close to Newark. I would be happy to
give someone a few bucks for their time... A digital camera would great, but
not necessary....
TIA
Michael Moore
