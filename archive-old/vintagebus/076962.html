Subject: Re: [VB] front seat area? 

ya, my parts list shows M164 as sliding side door for deluxes.
&amp;  model 241 is benchseat LHD deluxe microbus.

I don't understand how you are getting the M codes from the overhead airbox, 
though.  Normally the M code tag  is behind the passnger seat.  At least in 
RHD it's behind the pass seat.   Are those *all* the M codes on your tag?

Clara

The model number is 2416 the same code as Ben Laurence's double  sliding door 
deluxe. 241 is deluxe model right hand loading door lefthand  drive.
David Eccles book says m164 is the M code for deluxe sliding  door. Mike
