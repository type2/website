Hi Virge,
Sounds nice!  Is it a westie or other type of camper?
 
&lt;&lt;My question is the rear deck lid was shy a hinge pin and the deck lid has 
fallen and lodged itself stuck closed. I had to sell a bus before I could 
begin work on this bus and know that I am ready Ive noticed she leaked some 
oil. Since I cant get to the engine I dont want to fire her up until I can 
check the oil level.  Have you ever had this happen to a deck lid. Do you 
know if I can open the hatch from inside ? Ideas? &gt;&gt;
     Sounds like you need to use a putty knife slipped under the engine lid 
on the side of the not so good hinge.  Pry gently with the putty knife  to 
move the lid upwards, while you push the lid latch button and lift upward and 
rearward at the same time on the latch handle.  Then fix or replace hinge/s 
ASAP!    Eric&amp;Barb
