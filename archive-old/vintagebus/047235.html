&lt;&lt; I have a 67 that I ordered a new 68-71 master cylinder for, intending to
 switch it over.  When I look at the two side by side they look identical to
 me, except for the slightly smaller barrel on that accepts the pushrod on
 the new one.  Could it be that someone already converted it? &gt;&gt;
Hi Larry,
Yup, someone has done the conversion already.  the pushrod end of both MC are 
for fitting into the vaccume booster.  We use 1972-79 MC due to the fact that 
the Rabbit or 1967 only bus DMC reseviour fit on these years and the 
1968-70ish will not due to differant spacing between the mounting holes for 
the lines from the 1968-70 remote reseviour.   
&lt;&lt;The pushrod from the pedal mechanism doesn't appear to have ever been filed
down, but it seems to have no play in it and keeps the master slightly
depressed when I mount it.&gt;&gt;
Either you had better adjust it or cut/file it down more.  Eric&amp;Barb
