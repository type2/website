Subject: Re: [VB] re:tires

Thanks Harry,

Great idea. I just took a look at the situation and I think the best way is
to get a narrower tire. Odd thing is that I always had P205's and had no
problem. Must be a different profile on the Bridgestones.

&gt; Chris,
&gt; Will it stow uninflated? You'll have to carry a compressor and put up with
extra time to inflate it. Might be worth it. Porsche 924 had an inflatable
spare, but I've never seen a compressor in any salvage yard.
