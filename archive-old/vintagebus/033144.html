&lt;&lt; The old ones were shot so had little resistance, but since changed have
 blown fuses in a short time (seconds). ANY ideas?? &gt;&gt;
Hi Ric,
If the blades were moving way too slow to begin with then you might need to 
clean the electrical system till you get rid of any voltage drop though it.  
Then completely remove the wiper system, clean all the old gunk out and 
regrease all of it with all purpose grease.  Plus the gear box on the wiper 
motor to about 1/4-1/3 full of new lithuim white or clearish grease.  Do not 
use axle grease in the gear box as it gets way too thick in colder weather.
