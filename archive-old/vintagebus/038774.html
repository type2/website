Subject: Wiring harness recommendation needed

Hi,

I have a 65 Deluxe (21 window sunroof etc) and need to rewire from head to
toe.

I'm assuming that I can get some extra features (reliability?) by using a
later model wiring harness. Has anyone on the list done this?

Recommendations for a source are also appreciated.

You can reply back to me rather than the list to keep the traffic down if
you like.

Thanks,
Conrad (proud to be a hippie-bus-lover)
