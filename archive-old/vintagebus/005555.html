 Dawn had some problems as all us married people do. She delivered my custom
canvas tent pole cover as promised. Great workmanship and right to size.
Took a few months but that was the deal. Dawn and Richard are the perfect &quot;
VW Couple&quot; and I hope it works out for them and that I am invited to the
wedding if they decide to tie the knot. Some times crap happens and it takes
awhile to get it on track again. Richard and Dawn are welcome at my house
anytime.

John Howard
