Keep in mind that no 2 busses are the same. When i went to fix my taillight
holes, both were 2 different measurements and the 2 repair panels off a diff
bus were different measurements. I asked someone to measure his non messed
up tailight holes and HIS were also different than the other 2 sets.
search thru the archives for &quot;were VW assemblers drunk or what?!?!?&quot; if you
want to read more on this topic :) I can search thru my stash and dig up the
avg numbers I finally setlled on if you cant get anyone else to hook you up.
But NOS panels or an every day stock cruiser, theyll all be different. I'm a
perfectionist so &quot;settling for an avg number&quot; is not what i wanted to do,
but alas, no choice.
