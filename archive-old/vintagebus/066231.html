Subject: Re: [T2] Times they are a changeing

&gt;&gt;things continue to go on our buses seem to be taken over by the computer 
&gt;&gt;geek

I take offense to that since i'm a computer programmer BUT NOT A COMPUTER 
GEEK.

If i was a true geek i would be making enough dough to buy a 23 window, but 
no here i sit in my 1300 71 Westy.
