Are they these mirrors? http://dropgates.tripod_dot_com/mcode195_small.jpg
I know these mirrors are m-code 194 *and* 195 in the mid 50s cause i saw it
in a mid 50's parts book =). Was callin 194 bus and 195 was truck.. Although
as you all know m-codes changed thru the years, and since so many non-trucks
had 195, they musta changed it to somethin else at a later date (im guessin
around 60)
book didnt show a pic of the 195 just the 194 which is pictured at the link
above.

&gt;Well, that's interesting...
&gt;mine does have some mirrors that match the very description you have
given!!  I thought, surely,
&gt;that those were aftermarket, though
