Some dealers bought grey-market European spec and put the US-required
lights on them.  Mine has dealer-installed bullets on the front.
However, they were Ghia signals (chrome, not paint), and so the drain
holes are pointing to the sides rather than straight down.  An
interior rear view mirror was also retro-fitted by the dealer; it is
mounted off of the fresh air vent instead of the post between the
windshields.

Getting the initial destination port is probably the best absolute way
of finding out which way the vehicle was meant to be wired.
