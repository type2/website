Subject: Tuning the Type 2 Operator

This may look like a Friday topic, but I assure you it is not.

The operator of a type 2 is the only part of the bus that ties together
the engine, the brakes, the transmission, the steering, etc.

I have found that the operator of my bus (me) tends to have higher blood
temperatures and pressures when operating the bus in the company of other
vehicles: people who get p*ssed off when I don't go 0 to 50 in 4 seconds
when the light turns green, and who so indicate by passing me on the
right in a burst of speed.

(I'm just guessing that my blood temp rises, having declined to install a
temperature guage in either my dipstick or my sump while driving).

So what do other type2 operators do to keep their blood temps and
pressures down in traffic? Any tips will be appreciated.
