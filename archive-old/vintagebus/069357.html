Subject: Re: [VB] Tires, Camping/Road Trip preparedness

well I would try and get it fixed.especialy becouse of the sidewall gash
,the sidewall carries most of the weight of your bus. On monday I drove from
Nashville TN to Kansas city MO I had 2 blow outs becouse of the weak
sidewall (plus I was under a big load) but it was also I had cheap tires. I
wasn't driving my bus so the conditions would have been different if I was
65 instead of 80 and I have reinforced sidewall tires on my bus (I highly
recommend them when you have some loose change) As long as you aer not
hauling a lot of weight I would think you will be ok but you need to keep
the air pressure up becouse if you loose preassure it then make the sidewall
weaker . If it was me I would just replace the tire with any new tire to go
on the trip then replace it with a mathing later and keep the odd ball as a
spare..


replace it,

nick
