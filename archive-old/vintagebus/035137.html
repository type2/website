This is a question for the &quot;Custom Guys/Gals&quot; (I know your lurking out there!)

Since painting my bus, I still have the window frames out for the driver and
passenger doors. Without the windows , it sure looks nice, but not too
weatherproof!

Has anyone left their windows out and re-done the trim? Or even better, has
anyone done something custom like my &quot;Thing&quot;, so that you can just plug in
some windows when you need them!

We don't need much here in Florida in terms of weatherproofing, except for the
afternoon rains.

Sunny and breezy, 83 degrees!

Jerry
