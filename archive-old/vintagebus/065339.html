Subject: Wiper Arm Question

I have several wiper arms laying around I pulled off busses. Some have a longer &quot;base&quot; than the others and are overall (tip to tip) about 1inch longer. 

Question is, when did the wiper arms change?  Should a 61 have the longer or shorter ones?

 


Enjoy your day!
