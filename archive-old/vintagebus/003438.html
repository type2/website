Subject: Paint Code Help

Ok, I've been talking to the local parts people and I've come to the
conclusion that most of them are idiots.  Can someone please help me. I'm
looking for a cross reference for the following paint codes into a base coat
clear coat system:

L380 Turquoise/L289 Blue white
L325 Mouse grey/L87 Pearl white

The only thing I've been able to drag out of them is that L380=8040 in
DuPont and L289=8033 in DuPont, but they said they cannot mix that kind of
paint anymore, and can't find a cross in a base-coat clear-coat system.

Can someone help me out?

Thanks in advance
