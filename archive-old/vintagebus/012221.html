A bit about the 1641.
First, let me say that I am a strong supporter of stock, with the only 
modification being a good balancing. Now I am no rebuilder as Clara 
could attest to, she visited me today and offered advice on the replace 
main seal engine that has turned into the replace everything cause 
your're there already engine, and watched me fumble my way into looking 
at the crank arms....
But....
I have spent alot of time talking to rebuilders and alot of time 
watching what others do and seeing what they get out of their motors.
The 1641 that I had (I sold it 2 years ago with the bus it was in) 
worked great. The thin walls of the cylinders should dissapate heat 
better then stock. But if there is a problem it is warping. However, my 
rebuilder used a 1641 in his work truck and it worked great for him. The 
local Mobile VW mechanic (PLUG:Dylan Schnieder) had used a 1641 in his 
73 for over 130,000 miles, and yes it failed eventually, exactly like 
you would expect, cracks in the barrel. He replaced the bad cylinder and 
piston and keeps driving his work VW anyway. He has 200,000 miles on it 
at this point.
From what I gather, the 1641 with a single port is the way to go for 
that little bit more, without worry. Advise a doghouse cooler and 
nothing more. 
Again, I am a stock guy, I am driving a 1600 and my engine I am working 
on will be a 1600, but I have to give credit to the simple change you 
can make for more power.
