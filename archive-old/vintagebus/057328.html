Subject: Re: [VB] Overheating generally (&amp; Degreed Pulleys)

Interesting post. I have run a Berg pulley in my bus
(1600sp)for more than two years and have never
experienced a problem with overheating, even through
the south west and eastern sierra. My motor is
basically stock with the exception of a few upgrades:
010, Solid rockers/swivel feet adjusters, dual relief
case, doghouse set-up,full flow and a 1 1/2 qt sump. I
also run stock compression. I can't say enough how
vital it is to full flow and dog house your motor, not
to mention having it balanced before it is assembled.
Beside air, oil is the life blood of your engine and
you need to keep both of them in good shape. You will
get more out of a motor if you put a little more in to
the quality end of it. When was the last time you
checked the rubber boots that go over your spark plugs
at the head? How about the rubber &quot;gromets&quot; that plug
the holes on the tin above your muffler where the
heater hose is? Engine seal? These are often
overlooked but are vital to keeping your motor cool.
I would have to agree that the closer you are to stock
the better, bit a little tweaking if done right can
help!

&gt; Gene Berg's
&gt; degreed pulley is
&gt; &gt;&gt; actually heavier than stock (good for daily
&gt; driver) and
&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;stock&quot; size for an older sp motor.  Nonetheless,
&gt; it is too
&gt; &gt;&gt; small for a 1600 in a bus.  See my  post on this
&gt; at:
&gt; &gt;&gt; http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/type2/057252.html
&gt; &gt;&gt; Best option that I found was to verify the TDC
&gt; mark on a
&gt; &gt;&gt; stock pulley and add my own degree marks.  There
&gt; are various
&gt; &gt;&gt; ways to do this.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; 4) To set max advanced on a distributor w/ *both*
&gt; &gt;&gt; mechanical and vacuum advance (e.g. stock dist.
&gt; for 1600dp),
&gt; &gt;&gt; disconnect the vacuum advance (and retard if
&gt; present), set
&gt; &gt;&gt; the timing w/ a timing light so that you have the
&gt; desired max
&gt; &gt;&gt; advance (e.g. 30 deg. BTDC at 3000 RPM), then re
&gt; connect the
&gt; &gt;&gt; vacuum advance.  This works b/c under load, the
&gt; vacuum
&gt; &gt;&gt; advance mechanism does not come into play above
&gt; appx. 1/2
&gt; &gt;&gt; wide open throttle (WOT).  Thus, at 3000 RPM
&gt; under load, the
&gt; &gt;&gt; carb will be + 1/2 WOT and vacuum advance doesn't
&gt; have much
&gt; &gt;&gt; impact on timing.  In contrast, if you pull the
&gt; throttle open
&gt; &gt;&gt; by hand to increase RPMs while the car is out of
&gt; gear, the
&gt; &gt;&gt; carb will be at less than 1/2 WOT, vacuum advance
&gt; will come
&gt; &gt;&gt; into play, and total advance at 3000 RPM will be
&gt; higher.  On
&gt; &gt;&gt; a vacuum advance *only* distributor (e.g. stock
&gt; dist. for
&gt; &gt;&gt; 1600sp), this does not apply.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; My general advice:  If you have an overheating
&gt; problem,
&gt; &gt;&gt; return everything to stock.  everything.  tweak
&gt; it until the
&gt; &gt;&gt; overheating problem is resolved.  [Personally, I
&gt; feel that
&gt; &gt;&gt; oil temps over 225 in the sump are a problem. 
&gt; Where you
&gt; &gt;&gt; measure is an issue too.  Sump plate temp sensors
&gt; tend to
&gt; &gt;&gt; measure case temp (which is cooler) rather than
&gt; oil temp.  I
&gt; &gt;&gt; personally noticed a huge difference in readings.
&gt;  I like the
&gt; &gt;&gt; VDO dipstick sensor.  You can do a quick/dirty
&gt; calibration in
&gt; &gt;&gt; boiling water.  Remember, the oil in the heads is
&gt; likely
&gt; &gt;&gt; hotter than the oil in the sump.]  Returning
&gt; everything to
&gt; &gt;&gt; stock will be a lot of work.  No 009s, stock carb
&gt; jetting,
&gt; &gt;&gt; stock compression.....  Once you solve the
&gt; overheating
&gt; &gt;&gt; problem, if you still have any energy and want
&gt; improvements,
&gt; &gt;&gt; change one thing at a time so you can evaluate
&gt; the effect.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Mods that I like include Type IV oil cooler
&gt; properly
&gt; &gt;&gt; installed, full flow oil filter (which I don't
&gt; have), and
&gt; &gt;&gt; alternator (w/ correct alternator belt (different
&gt; from gen
&gt; &gt;&gt; belt!) and backing plates)  I can't claim to have
&gt; always
&gt; &gt;&gt; followed this advice, but any other approach
&gt; always ends up
&gt; &gt;&gt; being more time and $.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; All of this is much less important than the fact
&gt; that your
&gt; &gt;&gt; brakes are working perfectly.  and you have new
&gt; rubber fuel
&gt; &gt;&gt; lines.  and your seat belts are in good
&gt; condition.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Hope this helps,
