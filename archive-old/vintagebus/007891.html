Subject: Cutting &amp; Welding &amp; Rust, oh my!

I know some of you may scoff at my apprehension, having been much deeper in
it, but I would love a little advice and reassurance.

On the positive side, the rockers on my bus ('67 Kombi) are all solid and
straight....I love that, as I have seen and heard of much nastiness in this
area.

However, due to the existence of leaking windows and doors, and icky carpet
and/or plywood, there is a great amount of rust eating my floor.  Having
&quot;expertly&quot; appraised the situation, I decided to try and save most of the
floor with POR-15/re-enforcing mesh...but to cut out and replace the &quot;Cargo
floor, right outer 10&quot; only&quot;, which I ordered from Wolfsburg West this
morning.

The cutting of the old floor is my greatest fear...how much do I cut, where,
and what is the best tool for the job?  Any clues/advice from those of you
that have made it back from that dark place?

As far as the welding goes, I have a MIG welder that I've never used, but
I'll practice a lot on scrap...maybe I'll make some weird musical
instruments or something.

BTW....when welding, are there any special precautions I should take with a
bus that has a mostly empty tank (besides getting a gas cap that seals)?

Thanks a bunch

Gene
