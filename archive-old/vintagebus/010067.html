Why create a magazine with all it's inherent problems of logistics,
advertisers fighting for space, printing costs, minimum print runs of
10,000's, fighting distributors for shelf space, being in L.A. and St.
Petersburg and London and Sidney on the same day?

Do it in a e-zine instead. 

Unlimited space for stories. No printing. Worldwide distribution, (Yes,
California, even though I lived there for 16 years and love you, there are
other states and countries with small struggling events that really need the
coverage).

An issue could be 1 page or 20 pages or 200 pages, depending on who
contributes that month. And anyone can contribute stories and photos, even
you, dear reader. A chance to put your ideas in print for the world to see.
If your neighbor has a cool bus, go interview him, shoot some photos, send
it in and know it will be published.

Besides, this will give you people who sit around your tube all day long
something to do.

The only problem with an e-zine is it needs an editor, and a publisher. Lots
of work.
