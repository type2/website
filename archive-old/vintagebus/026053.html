Subject: [VB] Westy side latches
Message-ID: &lt;3819CF10.5EB2BA6E_at_variflex_dot_com&gt;

Hello,
I have a Westy latch at my house that is just gathering dust. If anyone
wants it they can have it for nothing, I'll even mail it to you. It's
one of the side latches that secures the wardrobe closet to the
bulkhead.  It's dirty but not bent or rusty. I have no need for it as I
don't have a camper :-(
