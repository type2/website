&gt;I'm wondering if anyone else has ran into this before.  My 63 camper's been
&gt;converted to 12V, but I wasn't able to replace the 4-way flasher relay
&gt;because there isn't a 12V equivalent for it.
&gt;
&gt;I've considered putting a volt drop on the incoming power wire so as not to
&gt;blow out the relay...but then that means there's only 6V going out of the
&gt;relay to the 12V bulbs.

Nope.  The only thing you have to worry about is the coil - the thing
that activates the relay.  The contacts shouldn't care.  The 6V relay in
my '64 is labeled &quot;180W&quot; for the contacts - in other words, it could
switch ten 6v/18w taillight bulbs or eight 12v/21w taillight bulbs and
still be in spec.  The coil however is 6 V.

I took the meter to mine and it draws about 0.55 amps at 6.1 V.  This
makes the resistance about 11.1 ohms, and since you're doubling the
(nominal) applied voltage, you need that resistance of voltage drop.
The resistor will need to dissipate at least 4 W.

The easiest solution is probably to boogie on down to Radio Shack and
get one package 271-131 (1 ohm 10 watt resistor) and one package
271-132 (10 ohm 10 watt resistor) - total cost $1.98 plus tax.  Since
you are in Silly Valley there might be a real electronics store with
11 ohm resistors but Rat Shock is everywhere.  Anyway, wire one of
the 1 ohm resistors and one of the 10 ohm resistors in series, and
put them between the wire that's now on terminal 86 and the relay:

                                                       | relay
---wire---&lt;&lt;---10 ohm resistor---*---1 ohm resistor---&lt;&lt; terminal 86
          f/m                  solder                f |
       push ons                                push on |__________

The resistors will get a little warm in operation, so don't put
them right up against your NOS kick panels.  They will only get
warm when you are using the 4-ways, and even then, they will
only heat when the outside lights are on.

There are other ways to do this.  The VW part number for this relay
on 12V vehicles is 211 953 191A, but good luck finding it.  You can
also do this with a couple of &quot;generic&quot; 12v automotive relays from
the FLAPS - let me know if you want the directions for this.

I hope this helps!
