&gt;BENTLEY lists the 1500 engine as having an output of SAE 51
&gt;bhp _at_4Krpm as the maximum output. Exactly the limit Mike
&gt;found.
 
Let me clarify that a bit.  I said that I was running an actual 67 mph at
4000RPM with my 1776 motor, big-nut rudux boxes, and 25.5&quot; diameter tires.
I also said I was limited by my gearing for top end speed, not by my motor.
The motor is quite capable of pulling well over 5000 RPM in 4th gear, but I
wouldn't expect the poor thing to last the Summer If I drove around like
that all the time.  It also has great torque at lower RPM and pulls like a
mule from as low as 2000 RPM.  That's why I want to have taller overall
gearing - so I can let the engine relax a little more while cruising 65-70
mph.
