Lots of people have noted how it should be placed axially.  Haven't
seen any comments on the other dimension, which is where it goes
horizontally (front/back) on the stand.  Once you place it on the
stand, but before you tighten down the strap, look at the alignment
between its pulley and the one on the crank.  If these aren't lined up
pretty close to perfectly, you'll go through belts faster than
gasoline.

For a while there, I was carrying three spares with me at all times,
since the odds were good I'd break one or two between Socorro and
Albuquerque (~80 miles).  Had quite a bit of extra fresh air hose,
too, since the belt tended to take out the one on the right when it
went....
