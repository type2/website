Is this yet another negative testamonial for Fram oil filters?

&gt; oil that his filter had spit out! The Fram's gasket had crimped, and he
&gt; was pouring out oil! Fortunately I had a Bosch oil filter, (Thanks Bus
&gt; Depot!) Dan installed it, with a quart of Valvoline (thanks Lou) and
&gt; they were on their way.
