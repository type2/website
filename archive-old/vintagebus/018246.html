Hi list,

I just got my new VolksWorld mag yesterday and I
noticed there is a company reproducing the latch
sliders that go in the bottom of the front window
slider area in stainless steel.  Anyone ever seen/use
these?  Also, I have a pair of these (used, rusted,
pretty beat up) that are pretty crappy, but I was
thinking I could restore them back to good use with
some work.  I have none in my bus now.  If they are
available as a new repop in stainless, this seems like
it would be worth it to me.

Not sure how much they are, maybe some of our friends
across the pond in the UK can enlighten us over here
in the colonies?

TIA!
Paul
