 So, what is the solution? Hoover says you can't
 straighten wide five

 that left my driveway, a '65 camper, developed very
 loose wheels after a 
 150 mile drive to it's new home. What is the cure
 for the everyday driver?
 
----------------------------------------------------

My wheels on my 66 and 67 have never loosened.

I torque my wheel bolts to 94 ft.-lbs.

Even when my right front tire blew at 70 mph on the
grapevine on my 67, the wheel bolts were still 94 ft
lbs......
