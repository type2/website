Hi all
I would Like to Nominate John Morris  of Ohio  to the AIRS hero Hall of
Fame!

Here is Why
I met Aaron Badertscher of  Ohio,  online and chatted about some camping
trips, which led to arrangements to meet up on the way to EveryBus .
Aaron had a chance to talk to John Morris, and John decided to join our
carabus!
Actually by the tone of his email... he seemed worried that a *split* bus of
his would hold up the tempo of the Bay brigade.....
Well, fortunatly we met up with John and Aaron in PA. and carabused to Va.
to meet with [ Honorable mention] Jeff Stewart on our way to EveryBus.
You can read the trip report on the EveryBus page,, But what I wanted to say
here,,,, We never knew any of these people 2 months before EveryBus,,, But
Jeff Stewart opened his house to a whole tribe of  unknowns,,,,
and John Morris  did a very kind thing,,,
and For this I think they need a Hip Hip hooray!
When Dave's Bus Finally quit running ,, due to the engine block completely
separating from the trans... we left it in VA..     JOHN was at home by this
time ,,, Left his house in OHIO and drove to Va.  Picked up Dave's Bus and
TRAILORED it to CANADA!   Prolly about  15 hrs one way,, then another 5 hrs
home!
He wasn't called on,, or asked to help out,,, but he met a guy who he heard
had problems,,, so he OFFERED to help out!!
WOW !
He is on the AIRS page .... John Wrote on the  Airs page... CAMPING SPOT:
MOVE IN!!! :)

Wow!  unbelievable!

This is My second usage of the AIRS pages,,,,, While in Colorado Springs
last year [ 99 ]  Dave Russell helped me work on my Bus in his garage... on
a fuel problem,, [ I don't like working on fuel in my own Garage, let alone
asking someone else to allow me to do it in theirs! ]
And he gladly took a DAY OFF WORK to help me!!   Thanks Dave!
Thankfully this time it wasn't My Bus that was in trouble again,,, But ,
back to my point:

I genuinely want to THANK the people....Thank You to The ingenious persons
who thought of the AIRS, Thank You to those that offer their names on the
pages for nothing in return ... helping others..   Thank You to the keeper
of the airs site  ......   Thank You to Type2.. and most important here
today,,,   Thank You to John Morris of Ohio on behalf of the CANADIAN
contingent in the EveryBus Carabus!!!!
