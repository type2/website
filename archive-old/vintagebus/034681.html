I remember a DARK RED 57 binz for sale at a pomona swapmeet about 2-5 years 
ago (Long time span I know). It had billet side gates, perhaps a billet bed 
as well.
Anyone remember that one?

Anyone know what happened to the restored 59 binz with Binz Karotisseri logos 
on the front doors? I believe it was form California, was featured on the 
cover of a SOTO newletter in the 80ies.

How about the one Ronnie rumored about a year ago from Pasadena? Anyone ever 
come up with it? My friend said he had a lead on it, but I havent heard a 
peep form him in months. Anyone?
