After reading about the low prices on Amazon_dot_com for the 50 Year Bus Book, I
did a search on Amazon for &quot;Type II.&quot;  It turned up many books on Type II
diabetes, one book on hyperfinite Type II mathematics, a few books on Type II
superconductivity, and one book on Type II VWs.
This book, titled Vw Bus Type II : Buying, Maintenance, Restoration by Jim
Tyler
is supposed to be published this month.  Anyone know anything about it?
