your points need to be opening and closing, are you sure you are seeing them
correctly...

if you are sure htey are not o/c then the adjustment screw may have slipped or
you need to put new points in...if this still doesn't fix it-it could be the
lobes in the distributor that are supposed to move the points have something
wrogn with them...although I have never heard of this happening.
