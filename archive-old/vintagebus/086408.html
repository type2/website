Subject: SHIFTER QUESTIONS

A month ago the linkage in my bus fell apart and it wasn't the first time.  
Took it to a mechanic and he put it back together .. Got in the bus and felt 
something familiar.  Something was in backwards.  I could EASILY find 
reverse on the way from 1st to 2nd gear .. went back and he made the 
adjustment .. That had happened once before and I surprised myself that I 
knew the cause .. just don't know the fix ...

A week later the linkage came apart again .. something [too tired to think 
about what the part was called] was replace .. and they did much welding .. 
Soon I will have to think about doing something about the rust under the bus 
..

NOW IT SHIFTS SO EASY from one gear to the next .. I am afraid it is falling 
apart. I even took it back to the mechanic I was so sure the weld wasn't 
holding .. he looked . Told me to shift hard .. over and over .. he said .. 
beat it up .. if it is going to fall apart .. let it do it here, rather than 
on the road .. I did reverse .. speed shifted .. etc etc .. it didn't come 
loose . The mechanic says that the gears are lined up perfectly and that is 
why it
is shifting so smooth .. but I was hoping for an opinion .. Could there be 
something he is missing .. the stick feels a little wobbley .. side to side 
feels like it should be tighter .. everything seems
loose .. or was it that I drove it for years and there was something wrong 
..  Thanks in advance for your opinions .. obviously I don't know how to do 
anything myself . . I know I should .. I have books .. the archives here .. 
etc etc .. I am just not at ease getting in the bus and driving it if I was 
the mechanic working on it ..

MY QUESTION/CONCERN IS THIS:  Is this how shifting should feel ?? EASY ??? 
And should the shifter be stiffer ??
