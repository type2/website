Subject: RE: [VB] Front end Q's (part deux)

Hey i just did my link pin also, they were new brazilian, and i had so much
trouble fitting my caps also, i end up reusing the old german one, but still
stiff to fit, took a hammer and time...

Old german bearing were metal one, new brazilian plastic !!  ohhh i squeeze
lot of grease in there through the nipple !!miam-miam



RE: The only complaint I have is that the caps that came with the new link
pins didn't come close to fitting with out a persuasion.
