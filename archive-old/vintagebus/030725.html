Hi all;
Does anyone know the exact dimensions for the mounting locations of a '66 
Westfalia child's cot? I know which pillars they should be mounted on, but I 
am not sure how high should each bracket be mounted, and at what angles, if 
any. If anyone can help me with this or point me to a good reference source I 
would really appreciate it. I just got an original child's cot and mounting 
hardware, and want to be very precise on where I drill, I am sure you 
understand...
Thanks,
Cris
