Subject: Re: [VB] Timing and overheating question...

Garrett,
  200 deg. F. is not too hot, get worried above 230. The oil needs to get
above 212 just to drive out the water vapor. It does sound like your timing
is a little advanced, 28-30 deg. max advance seems to be the accepted
figure. Reset your idle timing to 7.5 deg. BTDC, you'll end up just about
perfect.

Subject: [VB] Timing and overheating question...


&gt; Greetings List!
&gt; I am having problems with overheating. VDO gauge reading 200+ F at 60 MPH
&gt; w/stock tranny.I have a newly rebuilt 1500 SP with an 009 carb. I just set
&gt; the valves and points as per the Idiot book, and checked the timing which
was
&gt; set up by the local guru when he also replaced my carb with a rebuilt
PICT31.
&gt; MY strobe light reads 10 deg. BTDC at idle and 32-34 deg BTDC at 3000 rpm.
Is
&gt; this what is causing the heating problem? I do o.k. (160 deg.) for about
10
&gt; miles or so, then the needle on the temp gauge slowly creeps towards 200
&gt; where it seems to want to stay. My green idiot light also flashes
sometimes
&gt; at idle after running long distances. I want to take a 200 + mile trip
this
&gt; weekend with her to the Bayfront Blues Festival in Duluth. But with these
&gt; temps, I don't know if she can be trusted... Any suggestions?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Garrett
