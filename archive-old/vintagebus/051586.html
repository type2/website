&gt; Has anyone experimented with magnetic screens?

Hi Al,
As far as we know one can not magnetize most of these screens since they are 
made of aluminum.  You probably are thinking of magnetic drain plugs.  These 
have a magnet drilled/pressed in thier ends (Upper when bolted in the sump 
plate.).  The problem with most of these is the magnet is often sticking way 
up and when the bolt is in place this magnet shoves the bottom of the sump 
strainer up against the sump pick up tube.  Causing the flow of oil to be 
restricted!
  We have seen only once a ring made of  flexable plastic with magnets in it 
to seat just under and aganst the ID of the sump strainer.  It was made in 
Brazil.
  All of these are completely beat for filteration by a good quality oil pump 
with oil filter stand cast into it's cover.
