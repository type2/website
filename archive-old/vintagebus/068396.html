Subject: Rear Hatch

After 3 years, I'm finally finishing my '67. Unfortunately, its been a while 
since I painted it and I don't remember what rear hatch I ended up using. 
Mine was swiss cheese and unrestorable, so I picked up a used one somewhere. 
However, even though it fits properly, I don't think it was a '67. My 
original latch seems to small for the hole, which is 1 1/4 inches in 
diameter. Also, there is no mounting bolt hole in this hatch. 

Anyone have any thoughts?

Thanks
Jerry
