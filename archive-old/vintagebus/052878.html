Subject: Time to pay bills or I am selling gas heater stuff.

Since I spent way too much on holiday stuff I need to raise some cash.I am selling some BN4 gas heater parts.

I have one NOS thing heater unit incompleate and 2 look like new heat exchangers for BN4 heaters.

I have pics at http://communities.msn_dot_com/PicturesofVWs/shoebox.msnw of the parts.I have more parts but most of those relate to 181's specificaly.If someone could post to the bay and Thing list it would be most appreciated.

During the holidays I will be reachable at tsmit137_at_hotmail this is different from the address I am sending this from.
