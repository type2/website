This afternoon I spent from about 1:00 until 3:30 disassembling the front
beam from my bus.  The only things I haven't taken apart are the shoes/wheel
cylinder off of the backing plates, and the king pin assembly.  I removed
the linkpins only to find out that some rust had started to form inside due
to a lack of lubrication.  There is caked grease all over this beam but I
really doubt that the proper maintenance has been done to this bus since the
1987 Missouri inspection sticker was put on.  I came home to get the
Suburban so I can go pick up the goods from the shop and bring them back.
I've never been so greasy in my life - those torsion springs up front were
nothing but big balls of fresh grease.  Oh and that's another good thing -
it appears that the innards of the beam including the bearings are in really
good shape.  I'm going to have most of this stuff sandblasted and then por15
it.  Later!
