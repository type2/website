&gt; ----- Original Message ----- 
&gt;&gt; Today the last air cooled VW bus rolls of the Brazilian assembly line. No
&gt;&gt; more air cooled motor production. Article says they are building 200 
&gt;&gt; Silver
&gt;&gt; Edition Kombis for collectors and that is it. Last one is going to 
&gt;&gt; Germany to
&gt;&gt; the museum. They are going to all water cooled in Brazil due to pollution
&gt;&gt; troubles. Says over 6 million air cooled buses were built thru the years.
