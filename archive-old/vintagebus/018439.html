Subject: Xmas lights
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

A couple years ago the Split Bus Club did have a
holiday lights cruise. I couldn't attend (swingshift)
but I heard great reports. 

One of our members, Janet, had lights in her bus that
were battery powered. Don't know off hand where she
got them, but they are out there.

I'll ask Janet, but does anyone know of a source?
