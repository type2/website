Chuck,

I hope you are not taking those directions you have on your web site as the
best way to come.  By taking the 405 to the 10 you are driving about 40 extra
miles through some of the (all be it weekday) worst.....no THE WORST freeways
in all of L.A.  The 405 to the 10 through West L.A. will at certain times of
the day take you at least an hour to drive.  That's for a total of about 5-8
miles distance.

Instead, why not just stay on the 5 South down through East LA and on down to
Anaheim?  Or even easier (bus wise) is to transition to the East 134 (which
becomes the 210) and eventually dumps into the 57 and cruise right into good
O'l OC and exit Ketella at the Pond or Chapman and head E on to Irvine Lake if
that is where you are going.

BTW just so folks know....Irvine Lake is no where near Irvine the city.  The
directions Chuck has are OK.

&gt; Got a little bored and decided to make out my itinerary for Classic weekend.
&gt; Man O man am I stoked.  Follow the link below for a list of events for this
&gt; blowout weekend.  It's mostly regurgitation from vwclassic_dot_com but I added
&gt; some personal stuff that made it worth while making.  I will probably add to
&gt; it as I think/remember more stuff to do.  See some of y'all there.
