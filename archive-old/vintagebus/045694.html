I drove my 67' westy every where with very few problems. early trans w/ 
reduction gears is great for driving off road. 67 is thought by many to be 
the best year for reduction box trannys due to improved gearing. When the 
tranny and one redux. finally went (At the time I had a nasty habit of 
driving my bus as fast as it could possibly go while on the high way)in my 
bus I put in a freeway flyer. big mistake (every one has an opinion this is 
just mine) if you have a stock 1600 dp and drive up lots of hills. probably 
would have been nice with a 1776. In my opinion as far as having the most 
economical and reliable transportation thats easy to maintain with little 
mechanical knowledge(thats me) A 1600 dp with a dog house and a 67 tranny is 
the perfect set up, I would much rather be driving that bus than the 93 ford 
I drive now. I've driven all over with said set up, and like you this was my 
one and only car at the time. Speeds of 60-65 mph shouldn't be a problem. I 
always tried to keep mods to a minimum because of my mechanical ignorance and 
me being a cheap ba$%ard. But an electronic ignition is nice for buses that 
see lots of miles, especially at tune up time. As long as your split is in 
good shape, I say bay window be gone.
