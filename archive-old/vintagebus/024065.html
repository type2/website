Subject: re;upsidedownshocks

diana, check your shocks out, most shocks are made to work in one
position
with the shock upside down the internal valving might not function
right, hard dampning
or rebound, check with a offroad shop in your area, they usally know
shocks real good

a cheap way to cover the shock to protect it is to get an old bike inner
tube put it over the shock and clamp it, pour mans shock boot but it
does work, poke a couple holes at the top to let the air in and out.

hope this helps
