&gt; But Jerome is once a YEAR.  Everybody knows when and where it is.  It's
not like it's a surprise, all-of-a-sudden, &quot;Whoa!  There's a show!&quot; You have
365 days to get a bus together for the trip, minus travel time from your
destination.  Why does it have to be an episode of &quot;Junkyard Wars?&quot;
&gt;
But... but... but... I just sent all my thin-slot generators to be rebuilt,
just for Jerome... my engine compartment is in arranged pieces on my garage
floor...

It's no fun unless you are up till midnight the night before the caravan
slapping your engine in.
