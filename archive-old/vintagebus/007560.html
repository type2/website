This week has been full of meeting listees - I've never seen so many in such
a short time.  With Steve Johnson's stopping by on Monday, the Fatherland
Tour in Lincoln on Wednesday, and now Diana Krebs visit, I'm getting an
excellent look at just who we have on our lists.  They're all cool people.

Diana Krebs from the vintagebus list showed up this evening in Beatrice, NE.
I got back from a delivery and here sat this whitish westy in the parking
lot!  It looks so much like my bus, I could actually imagine what it will be
like when I get mine running.

Diana is going to camp out in our back yard tonight - she's enlightened all
of us to what it's like growing up in the Pacific Northwest - something that
is totally new to me in this conservative, starched shirt land called
Nebraska.  We had a nice long chat after supper tonight and discussed lotsa
things.  One thing I found fascinating was that she grew up with the metric
system so here we were discussing temps in degrees F and mileage in miles
(when talking about weather and old VWs) assuming, without thinking, that
she would know what we were talking about.  We finally got out an old
thermometer I had with the dual scales on it and we soon established common
ground. :-)  We just ballparked at the km/mileage ratio. :-)

I also bought her some lunch tonight (my traditional listee treat) and got
to ride in a split window Westy - my first time to ride in one!  I've come
to know Dimas (sp?) her very protective dog.  He's a great dog and better
than a body guard!

It seems that Diana is very adept at taking care of herself and her westy.
She's pulled engines, fixed a bad fuel pump, replaced a coil, and done
things that would strand most people on the side of the road - including me!
To be honest, I freak when I have problems on the side of the road and the
farther I am from home, the worse I freak out.  Diana is over a thousand
miles from home and seems all calm and cool about the whole thing - I only
wish I could be this way on a trip in my dub - I'm so high strung I'm worn
out before I start.

I'll post more later - we still gotta get her Westy parked in the backyard
for her overnight stay.

Thanks for reading.
