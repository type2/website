Subject: [VB] gas tank leak anyone?

Before I left work today, my boss alerted me to the fact that there was a really big gas spill coming from my bus.
 Well, I had replaced my fuel lines recently and they were not the problem.  I couldn't see any leakage from them at all.  The leak seemed to be coming from the fuel tank itself.  It wasn't dripping when I looked at it but the stain on the ground seemed to indicate that the 1/2 tank of gas that was in there was gone.  I had enough gas to drive to the gas station where I knew the only way to see the leak in action was to put in a few gallons.
   I put it 2.5 gallons and saw gas dripping from the area where the outlet is.  It didn't appear to be coming from the outlet itself but I tried to tighten it a bit. The gas seemed to be coming from somewhere else.
	 It was a warm day here ( ha ha! like 50 F ) so I wonder if some slight expansion from sitting in the sun caused a hole to expand?  It really hasn't been that warm here yet.  After putting in the 2.5 gallons I drove back to work and the leak seemed to have stopped.
	 My question is : has anyone had a gas tank leak?  Since it was getting dark, I will have to revist this tomorrow.  It is looking like I will have to pull the motor and actually pull the tank to see whats going on.  Is there any way to patch it temporarily ( i.e epoxy ).  Also, do the new tanks availiable fit easily. If there is a small drip how paranoid should I be about driving it like that?  The drip is falling on the heat tube.. 

	 thanks
