Subject: Re: [VB] Re: survey: testing cooling etc [VB] was side scoops

&gt; Measuring the louvers on my 64 bus, I show about 105 square inches of
&gt; opening (taking into account the tapered ends of the louvers). Just a little
&gt; bit more than the equivalant of a plain white sheet of paper. That is how
&gt; big the opening is to let in fresh air. Anyone with access to a bay window
&gt; want to measure thier intakes to see what they come to?

Well quick and dirty I measured the 68 and I get like 33 sq in per side
which is a total of 66 ok Ill give it some slop factor and say not more
than 70 sq in total.
