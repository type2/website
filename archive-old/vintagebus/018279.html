I have just saved a 66' camper with reduction gears. I have a complete set of
Porsche 912 IRS parts. I have two Porsche 901 (902?) transaxles. The delimma
is HOW to make it work???
I wish to install the 901 series transaxle and use the 912 IRS. Has anyone
done this? (I searched the archives). Any advice, experience?

TIA,
Raymond McGill

p.s. I will be giving much of the campmobile interior away if anyone wants it.
First come.
