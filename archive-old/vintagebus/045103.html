Can anyone tell me if there is a difference in outter right rockers between a 
wolfsburg and a non wolfsburg bus?
I was out checking out the westy, staring at its lovely rusty rockers and 
noticed that the outter edge, the &quot;lip&quot; where the seal goes in (most visable 
when cargo doors are open and seal is installed) appears to be more rounded 
than the one on my July-56 bus.
I had a rocker clip I hacked form a 60, which seemed just like my 57, 
I also had a clip from a 67 which the edge appeared even tighter than the 
other ones I had.
Is it possible that over the years they changed the stamping process?
The repop rocker I have here looks VERY, VERY close ot the original one on 
the westy, but not like the one on the July-56 bus.
Make sense?
Anyone got close up photos of any rockers on pre May 13th, 1956 busses?
Thanks-
Greg
