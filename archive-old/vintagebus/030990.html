 would it make
&gt;the most sense to buy the later model mentioned earlier to use daily AND a
&gt;split-window for Sunday use/(restoration).

Jay:
What you mention is the arrangement that I have had for the last 5 years or 
so, and my advice is don't get into it if you can possibly avoid it. Owning 
two VWs means a lot of your time keeping them running. The fact that one of 
them is a garage queen could translate into a not so reliable vehicle, since 
you don't have that intimate connection that only comes from driving the beast 
every day.That is how you get to know the odds and ends of your bus and thus 
becoming able to diagnose inmediately whatever symptoms of malfunction it 
might be experiencing.
My '91 Westfalia is an amazing and beautiful machine (I know that this is the 
wrong list to mention this).At the same time, I think the same about my '65 
bus. The problem with that is that I refuse to get rid of any of them. This 
means extra insurance money, storage, parts, time servicing/fixing, etc. So my 
humble advice is, buy a splittie drive it every day and enjoy it. If for some 
reason you are not happy with it, sell it and buy a later bus/Vanagon.
It is really an addiction, and has the potential of being expensive if you 
have to multiply by two, or three, or... 
Once you get a second bus there might be no turning back...Just ask many on 
this list!
