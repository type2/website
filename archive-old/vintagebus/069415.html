Subject: Re: [VB] SO-22 &amp; 33  was  Re: [VB] Sub hatch in 1965?

&gt; which was lost somewhere.  The SO-22 &amp; 33 was the ultimate Westie interior
&gt; for ease of installation and removal at a moments notice.  Some of the VWoA
&gt; literature even shows how this Westie camper interior could be installed for
&gt; the weekend and removed for the workdays.  This interior appears to have been
&gt; sold by dealers as a seperate accessory you could order for your non-Westie
&gt; bus.  This way the loonnngggg wait for an official complete Westie could be
&gt; avoided and one could be camping all the sooner.

It would be really great if we could make a set of plans to repro these
interiors. &gt;
