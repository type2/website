Subject: parts

My friend, Casey Missal, is having a problem getting the Bus Depot to be 
responsive about a part he ordered. I was just getting ready to place an 
order for rubber seals from there but am now concerned. What increases my 
concern is that they do not answer my emails. I am interested in knowing 
list members experiences and whether I should place my order.

Also, the seal for the rear hatch is REALY EXPENSIVE! Does nayone know if 
there is a good substitute available in a hardware store or something?
