&gt;  I've got the turn signals and headlights working, only funny thing is they 
&gt; also work when the ignition is in the off position.  Is this right?  If 
&gt; not, what could be wrong?

Hi Charles,
Headlights will work with ignition turned off.  The turn signals on the other 
hand will not.  Check you wiring again!    Eric&amp;Barb
