Well, I'd certainly drain it first, since it'll be empty by the time
you're done in any case....

I have a question, from seeing how long some of my half-hour jobs have
taken: how long is your neighbor willing to have his crane and/or
hoist dedicated to holding your bus up?  It doesn't really sound like
you've got an afternoon's work to do.

Using the bumper mounts seems fairly reasonable, assuming the cross
bracing between the two main frame pieces is in good shape.  You could
always put in extra bracing (say, 4x4s and *big* clamps).

What's going to keep the vehicle from going the rest of the way over
onto its side?  What are you going to use to catch it when it goes
over anyway?  Remember that most car tires/rims aren't really designed
to handle high side-loading....

If I were going to do something like hoisting a bus, I'd probably:

- make sure there were no fluids in the vehicle anywhere (make a list
  of what was drained from where; don't forget brake system, steering
  box, windshield washer fluid, etc)
- get a couple of those Bungee Straps From Hell that they use for
  lifting big, odd-shaped objects (the neighbor probably has some for
  use with his crane)
- loop them around the vehicle, and hook them to the crane
- use the crane to lift the vehicle off the ground a few feet
- use the hoist to rotate the vehicle to the desired angle
- if you're really good, you'd rig a second set of straps to the crane
  at this point and remove the first, so the hoist is no longer needed
  to keep the vehicle at an angle; however, having the hoist attached
  would probably help keep things stable while you're welding and
  banging and such

This all assumes dedicated use of the crane and hoist, or getting fast
at getting things set up and torn down.
