Subject: engine decision
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.GHP.4.05.9812011506510.12711-100000_at_raven.csrv.uidaho_dot_edu&gt;

I haven't written to the list in a while, so I thought it was about time.
My subject is that I have two engines that are in the process of being
rebuilt for different reasons.  One is a 1776cc w/ dual Zenith 32NDIX
carbs, and the other is a 2180cc w/ dual Weber 44s.  I do have two VWs
that they are slated for also, I just want to make sure that I match the
right engine with the right car.  The 1776cc is in my '56 oval right now
but needs to be gone through because of some mechanical trouble.  The
2180cc is going to go in my '67 Sundial camper whenever the camper is
actually road worthy.  I really want to do some major traveling around the
country in the Sundial and was wondering if the 2180cc would be reliable
enough to make that happen.  Oh, yah, I also have a 1600cc dual port that
could work.  If anyone has any thoughts on hi-perf motors in busses, let
me know!  Thanks in advance.
