Subject: Re: [VB] front shift rod coupler, how to loosen

&gt; The set screws
&gt; came out easily but I'm having trouble getting the
&gt; coupler loose from the shift rod.
&gt;
&gt; I've tried:
&gt;
&gt;   soak everything in penetrating oil
&gt;   multiple &quot;heat with propane torch/cool with water&quot; cycles
&gt;   tapping on the coupler with hammer while holding shift rod
&gt;
&gt; Does anyone have a good method for getting these parts
&gt; apart?

God I love my air chisel. Haven't even broken a sweat since I discovered
that it had a speed adjustment knob. Put the dullest sorriest chisel on it
that you can find and slow it down so it hardly even taps. Speed it up a
little and push. Walk the collar right off of the shaft, then turn around
and walk the shafts apart. It's coming off, just be patient. If it's
rat-a-tat-ing at just below the speed where it cuts metal, you are there
brother! Light up a stogie, adjust your skivvies so they aren't binding,
spend a minute and thump the hell out of it. You ain't going anywhere till
it's done, what's your hurry? Oh, and that funny looking curved dovetail
bit? Please. What that will do to a stuck drag link will almost make you
soil yourself. Oh sure, the rear joint is easy enough to beat off with a
BFH, but that front one is a motherless SOB. Pickle fork my ass. It may work
well enough on stuck pickles, but there is nary a pickle under a rusted old
bus. Sneak that curved air chisel bit in there and pry against the Pitman
arm and start that slow rat-a-tat. Afore you know it the drag link will be
laying across your bleeding forehead like it was part of your Halloween
costume. People, if you don't have a Y2K compliant air compressor and an air
chisel set, and you like fooling with splittie buses, you're some kind of
sicko. This ranks on the gotta have it list right beside the deep 10mm
socket and 3mm wrench. If this doesn't work for you, you need a bigger
compressor. Tell the wife, Christmas is coming.
