&gt; If I'm not mistaken my two early 67 busses have a threaded opening in the
&gt; B-pillar.  Is it possible these are already prepped for shoulder belts
&gt; (possibly required in some advanced country at that time?)

My Kombi, built June 1967, has these too.  They're in the perfect place
for shoulder belts, and seem to be threaded &amp; reinforced; I haven't
tried fitting any of the seatbelt sets salvaged from Bugs and T3's yet
because the bus is still in the early project stage :-( There are
plastic plugs in the B-pillar holes because it appears to have only come
with lap belts.  (These anchors look suspiciously like the rear-seat
shoulder-belt anchors that were artfully hidden under the headliner on a
'71 Squareback.)
