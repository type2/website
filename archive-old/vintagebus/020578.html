&gt; Hopped into the splitty tonight to take a ride and
&gt; warm up the oil so that I
&gt; could drain it and change it out.  Too bad that
&gt; stupid me didn't get an oil
&gt; filter so here I sit - not able to change oil.  :-(
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, I hit the highway to cruise and took a 15 to
&gt; 20 mile trip.  Everyone
&gt; is passing me so I floored it.  Maxed out on the
&gt; level at 77mph and engine
&gt; sounds sweet.  Speed limit is 65 and now everyone is
&gt; falling back away from
&gt; me - nice feeling in a splitty but isn't the normal
&gt; way I cruise.  Normal
&gt; for me is 65 to 70.  Outside ambient temp weas 77 so
&gt; the oil temp never got
&gt; above 175.  Coming into town I surprised a few
&gt; people who thought all buses
&gt; were lackluster in performance.  Can't help myself.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, babied the ol' girl the rest of the way home
&gt; and parked in the
&gt; driveway.  No oil leaks either.  I got it right guys
&gt; - I really did.
