Well I don't really have the dough for this so the almighty VISA will take
care of me for now.  After a lot of thought and discussion with my brother,
I've really leaned towards and been convinced towards building a 1776 engine
for my bus which will provide me with a little extra power for hauling
cargo, pulling a trailer if need be, and driving through them mountains
enroute to Cali.  Since I have this set of 40IDF's I might as well build an
engine that can use them.  I've decided to use Painter's Grinding at
www.paintersgrinding_dot_com in Denver, CO for my machine work.  They have a 48
hr. turnaround time and their close location to me makes for a lot less time
and shipping costs involved.  I'm also planning on ordering from Barrett
Enterprises for some parts unless you guys in the VW business can give me a
better deal.  Here's what I've worked up so far:

Barrett:

C/W Crank with $40 core                    $94.95
P/C 90.5 x 69mm                                $159.50
Engle 110                                            $49.95

PGrinding:

LineBoring                                            $37.50
Decking                                                $20.00
Big Bore                                                $28.00

I've already full flowed this case but I need to talk to these people and
see if they can mill down the surface any so as to clear my pulley tin
better.  All this puts me at about $350 which isn't too bad.  My rods are
okay - they have absolutely no play in or out which is more than I can say
for a lot of other engines I've tore down.  I also need to find out of the
gears on the crank are included in Barrett's crank price - more than likely
not.  I'm almost ready to split my case tonight so I'll see how the lifters
are.  Hopefully my heads will be in good enough shape that I won't have to
buy a new set but seeings as how the rest of this project is going....
