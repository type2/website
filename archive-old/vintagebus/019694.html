Was written--------------------------------
A Utah contingent of buses humbly chimes in that 4 or
5 buses will be traveling on US 50(&quot;the lonliest
highway in America&quot;) across central Nevada to BYOB and
KP.  We will be taking 2 days to get to the barn by
Friday evening. Look for my 63 DC, a 64-23 window
delux or a 58 panel,a 66 Dormmobile, a 59 panel or a
66 original paint Dove blue Westy, possibly a 62
DC, etc. all with Utah plates traveling slowly across
the desert into the sunset.

Should anyone traveling through northern Nevada on
their way to Kelly Park need a place to park for the
night, I do have plenty of space to 'camp' on my
property. I am just a couple of miles north of Reno
and have five acres to put VW's on......

Reno  NV
ps...also a big garage to do any needed repairs
