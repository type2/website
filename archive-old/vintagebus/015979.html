There should be a label on the battery, as well as one on the voltage
regulator.  Or just pull any light bulb and look at what's stamped
into the base.  If you have an electric choke, it should have the
operating voltage on the outside cover, as well.

And, for this application, you would use a voltmeter, not an
ohmmeter.  The latter is used for measuring resistance (in units of
ohms).
