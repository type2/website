Aye; abundant slack is the harbinger of the Great Green Arkleseizure,
and the coming of the Great Hankerchief, along with the White PainMobile
with flashing lights.  You can fix it with a jigeer from a pan-galactic 
gargle blaster, but on the flip side of the diurnal anomaly, you'll 
find yourself tacking betwixt the lanes like a 4-wheeled clipper ship.

Any hoopy frood who knows where his towel is at will send said box out
for the great rebuild.
