 Pfft! I had never encountered this before. Not even
 with the &quot;old&quot; 34 PICT carbbie. (A quick check in
 between the last sentence and this one confirmed that
 both carbs are identical-not some variation on the 34
 models.)
 The counter clown at the Bad Attitude Place said that
 he had never heard of such a thing as the arm hitting
 the alternator. He said that I must have something
 messed up. &gt;&gt;
yes, I know what you mean.   I think it has something to do with the location 
of the intake .   Sometimes it is like that.   I would put a spacer between 
the carb and the manifold.   Been there, done that, wondered why, didn't want 
to grind things.
