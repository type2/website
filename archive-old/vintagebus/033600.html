Subject: BUS AC

    I've got it figured out. If you have a walk through bus, instead of a
under dash or overhead unit you can put the evaporator in the cubby hole
under the front seat.  If installed there you could drill a hole through the
floor and tap into the existing heater tube, put in a on off valve to
control the air to the back and have AC coming out of the original openings.
The evaporator would then be using the air in the bus to cool, so as the
temps dropped in the bus the evaporator would not be working as hard trying
to cool exterior air. A small blower fan and the job is done. I have seen
similar set-ups on street rods, using the hidden evaporator and tapping in
the existing heater channels. All parts should be available from Vintage Air
and I am going to start working on a drop in unit for my 1960 DC. At the
SEMA show in November every AC company in the country has booths, I will
need a wheel barrel for all the lit I will collect. As far as the condenser
go I C E AC company uses 2 condensers on there systems, 1 under the vehicle
and the other (smaller) in the engine compartment close to the compressor,
with the receiver/dryer hidden in the wheel well.

Ronnie   soon to have AC in my DC
