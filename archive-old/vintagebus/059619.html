Subject: I'm not shocked...

Okay, I took the maiden voyage today with the slam-o-matic and came to
the realization that my stock KYB shocks were bottomed out completely
and my suspension consisted primarily of tire.
 
Sooo, I bought some Empi (sic) &quot;short shocks&quot; that are used for bugs,
typ3's, etc. this afternoon and figured they would do just the thing.
Got home and put them on to find out that they had about 1/2&quot; or less of
travel before they too would bottom out.
 
Anyone out there have any suggestions? The rear suspension is '68 IRS,
so I only have about 6-7&quot; between the shock points. Has anyone had to
get custom shocks or something for another vehicle? Not too many FLAPS
in this area to ask about this...
 
Thanks,
 
~Rich
'60 DD Panel - bottomed out, but no longer &quot;smearing&quot; oil...
