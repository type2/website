&gt;I just called WW and Bfy and neither one had springs for the front door
handles. So, how would have these for my 59 double cab... I need two.
&gt;
I used springs from the hardware store, they had ones that matched, just
had to cut them shorter and bend the little end outward.  I have a set of
2 NOS ones when resto time arrives, some crazy guy gave them to me for free.
 ;)

&gt;Also, I'm looking for a source of parts to rebuild my empi camber compensator...
i.e. straps, bushings, and rubber pads.  Anybody have a source?
&gt;
I've seen the straps on eBay.  I bet bushings could be gotten from one of
those jacked-up 4x4 places, they have all that stuff.  Rubber pads?
