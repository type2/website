I think 64 was the first year with an outward lip ,its the same up thru, 
71and maybe 72 ,,you can get the panels from Wolfsburg west ,,and i noticed 
today looking thru BFY's Catallog they list it also for the 64 thru 67 ,i 
think WW was about 30.00 or there abouts ,,i have used it decent panel had to 
modify it a bit ,,the BFY one might be a direct fit ,,but i don't know that 
for sure ,,Later
