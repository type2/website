I can tell you what NOT to do...
Have done a couple of things that I regret regarding
tents and truck tilts.


1.&gt; Do NOT use bleach.
2.&gt; Do NOT be aggressive while cleaning.
3.&gt; Do NOT use a 3M scrubbie or strong brush.

Unfortunately have violated each in the past.

I suggest Woolite and gentle scrubbing/soaking.

Obviously, that the stitching is old and probably
weaker than it was when new. Tread lightly. Remeber
that you can always do more but cannot go back.

Back in the day, I got agressive with my first truck
tilt. Went after it with hot bleach water and a scrub
brush in an attempt to make it &quot;whiter&quot;. Ranks right
up there with slamming suspension into the ground, up
dating oldEuro TypeI's from semaphores to incorrect
year turn signals and anything related to stinger
exhausts...
The bleach and agression weakened the stitching and
the whole thing literally shreaded the first time that
I drove it down I-10. &lt;dummy&gt; People kept passing me
staring until I realised that all I had was a pile of
canvas flags furiously flapping behind me...

The red stripes of a nearly mint EZ tent/awning got
affected by an over zealous wife's scrubbing with a 3M
pad &lt;doh!&gt; while I was busy selling 15&quot; wheels to VW
Howard and Ronnie in the backyard. (Boy, was I pissed)
So pissed that I did my hair into Coolio spikes and
attended a show like that. Hair-doo was a sociological
experiment to see what it must be like to have
everyone try to deal with you like you are totally
normal when you have tatoos and piercings all over
your face. Totally flipped out some of my friends. Got
asked by several people if I had any spare Special K,
nugs or a new sexual preference. No breakfast cereal,
gold ore or lifestyle changes. Sorry...just a warped
sense of humor. Came across like Bullworth.
Oh yeah back to the tent question:
Might try a test section with pouring salt onto
intentionally wet canvas and laying in the AZ sun. I
could could see that might 86 the mold and possibly
gently bleach the cloth without totally biffing it.

I'd just go with the Woolite and warm water. Use the
tent and tell people that you are just &quot;doing it YOUR
way.&quot; =)

Is the extra section a privy divider? Ask Beto to
compare with his (my old) tent.
