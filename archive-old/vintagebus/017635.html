They do good work, some people consider their stuff &quot;over-restored&quot;
I actually got to visit their shop when I was down in LA for the
classic.

They're quite spendy.  Where did you come up with the $15k #?  That sounds
cheap coming from them.

It probably would cost ~$75k to have them do my '54!

&gt; Their work looks top notch.  Total restore, what we need, runs about $15 - 
&gt; $20K...we were thinking about $15,000 is what it would take, the extra $5,000 
&gt; get's a little &quot;tighter&quot; job (decision time).  Your thoughts are welcomed and
