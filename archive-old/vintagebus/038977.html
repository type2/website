Message-Id: &lt;CMM.0.90.4.928996974.lcs_at_defiant.mit_dot_edu&gt;

&gt; Any suggestions on what type of tool and procedure you folks have found
&gt; successful in removing the pin that secures the e-brake handle?  I cant
&gt; seem to figure a way to get a hammer and punch up in there.  Bentley
&gt; just says remove the clips and pin and pull the handle out.  Oh, if it
&gt; were only that easy!

I have the exact same problem, and assumed it's because someone in the
chain of PO's lost the front splash pan.  Rust has made the pin one
with the sleeve in the E-brake handle on my '67 too.

I tried lubricants (including the legendary Kroil, which didn't fare any
better against the most recalictrant Teutonic rust than plain old Liquid
Wrench or WD40).  I tried a good dose of heat from the Blue Wrench.
Nothing has helped; I grabbed the pin with vise grips and tried to twist
it within the sleeve, until the exposed part was fairly shredded.  It
never budged.  It's even possible to get a cold chisel in there at an
unfavorable angle and hammer away at it, but that (in combination with
heat or Kroil) didn't help either.

So for now, I'm leaving it there -- it's annoying but it isn't going
anywhere and the brake handle still works.  There's nothing left to
clip the circlips to, thanks to vise-grips and pipe wrenches, but
I figure the pin isn't going to come out from a little road vibration :-).
It's been fine since last September.

Here's how I'm planning to solve it, once I get another E-brake handle
(and hopefully a splash pan):  Cut through both the sleeve and pin
with a Sawzall, on both sides if necessary.  With a replacement brake
handle, I just toss the old one, otherwise it'll be necessary to drill
or hammer out the pin, and use washers as spacers to make up for the
missing width of sleeve that the Sawzall ate, when putting it back together.

The pin is pretty easy to make if you have a friend with a lathe, or
perhaps you could get a metric dowel and drill it for cotter pins.

If anyone has a better idea, please post!
