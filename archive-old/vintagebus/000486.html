Hi Mike,
Actually it should be TMV-MSG-PDS X 
T = Type 1-4

MV = Model version (211= Delivery Van (Double door right, LHD).  213 = 
Delivery Van (Double door right, LHD).  214 = Delivery Van (Double door left, 
RHD).  215 = Delivery Van (Double doors left and right, LHD).  Etc....)  The 
last digit of the first three digit group also tells if it is for a left (Odd 
numbered.) or right (Even numbered.) hand drive VW.  Left designated side 
drive parts will more often than not, fit RHD.  While no RHD parts should be 
able to fit into a LHD.  

M = Main Group (1 = Engine.  2 = Fuel tank, Exaust, Heating system.  3 = 
Transmission.  4 = Front axle steering.   5 = Rear axle.  6 = Wheels, Brakes. 
 7 = Frame, Hand lever, system, Pedal cluster.  8 = Body.  9 = Electrical 
equipment.  0 = Accessories.)

SG = Subgroup

PD = Part Designation

S = Side (Odd for left (American driver side.), Even for right (American 
passenger side.), Niether side = 1)

X = Modification Letter

VW uses their part numbers.  According to what I have been able to find on 
Type2 is that its general form is:
 
 TCS-MSS-###
 
 T=Type  could range from 1-4 based on vehicle type
 
 C=Chassis  Does anyone know what these designations would be?
 
 S=Side  Odd for left, Even for right, No Handed...=1
 
 M=Main Group  0-9  found list on type2
 
 SS=Subgroup  found on type2
