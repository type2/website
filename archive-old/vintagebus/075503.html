&gt;
&gt;The harness was cut, and only partially pieced back together using one
&gt;color of wire, wire nuts and crimp connectors (!) by PO just forward of
&gt;the engine compartment.

Crimp connectors (the little bare metal or red/blue/yellow tubes) can
work OK if properly installed.  In the stock harness, all of the push-on
females were crimped onto the wires by machine.  You can get a good
manual crimp with a ratcheting tool (expensive) or a regular crimping
tool and strong hands.  However, if the DPO used wire nuts and only one
color of wire, I would question their crimping prowess.

Often, people that use one color of wire also use the same gauge of
wire for everything.  Using, say, 14 gauge for the tail light, coil,
and warning light wires is OK, but the main generator wire needs to
be thicker.  The wire nuts have to go, too.

&gt;1.  Yank harness and replace with readily available US spec harness,
&gt;    kluge together wiring to make 3 wire TS work.

The basic difference in the rear lights is that a Euro-spec Bus has five
wires going to the back (left tail, right tail, left turn, right turn,
stop) and a US-spec bus has four (left tail, right tail, left stop/turn,
right stop/turn).  The usual way that US buses are set up for Euro rear
lights is to put all of the tail lights on one wire, freeing up a wire
that is then used for the brake lights.  This also requires a couple of
changes at the dash.

There's a slight difference in the front parking light wiring as well.
The Euro front parking lights come off the fuse box, while the US ones
come off an extra terminal (57) on the headlight switch.  With a US
harness and Euro switch, you'll end up with one &quot;extra&quot; wire at the
headlight switch.  This can easily be fixed by putting the &quot;extra&quot;
wire on terminal 58, along with the the wire that's already there.

&gt;2.  Replace with US harness, and go 'Merican throughout (find US TS,
&gt;taillights, etc.)

This will work but is potentially expensive, especially for the turn
signal switch.

&gt;3.  Yank harness, and replace with a special order euro harness (can
&gt;someone make one? How much?)

One lead: http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/wiring/harness.html  I don't know
if he makes Euro harnesses but you can ask.  You might find somebody
that can make one if you send them your old one first.

&gt;4.  Yank harness and fuse block, clean off paint, rebuild rear section
&gt;using wire from parts bus in town, put back in and rewire according to
&gt;euro wiring diagram

As long as the parts bus wire is decent, and you make good splices,
this can work.  Stagger the splices so they aren't all in one lump.

A basic splice is to use insulated butt splices, crimp really hard,
and wrap with tape (if you crimp hard enough, you'll go through the
insulation on the butt splice.)  Use heat-shrink tubing instead of tape
for a slightly fancier job.  This will work OK for the smaller wires,
but I'd probably do one of the next two methods for the main battery
wire and starter solenoid wire.

Next step up is to twist the wires together and solder them, then either
tape or heat-shrink.  Use at least a 100 W iron; more will be better,
especially for the heavier wires.

The top-of-the-line splice is to get uninsulated butt splices, crimp
them on, solder the wires to the splice, and put heat-shrink over the
whole thing.

Once you've spliced all the wires back together, and have confirmed
that everything works, bundle them all back up in something.  VW
originally used plastic (PVC?) sleeves; these days, that split
corrugated plastic tubing is easier to find.  Either one will keep
the wires together and provide additional protection.

&gt;5.  Leave harness in place, clean off paint, rebuild and troubleshoot
&gt;while in the bus.

If the Bus was running before you painted it, then this can work.  If it
was my Bus and I had just painted it, I'd get the wiring in tip-top
shape to avoid adding realistic flame effects to the paint job.

&gt;I'm leaning towards #4, but is removing the wiring harness without
&gt;cutting it in the center a nightmare?

Bentley says you can do it without cutting; I've never had to do it
myself.  See page E-15 1 of the '63-'67 Bentley for directions.

&gt;Additional things I need to worry about?

If you put in US-spec sealed beams, you may have to change the headlight
connectors.  Not a big deal, but something you have to do.

Your Bus is probably not set up for hazard flashers, unless a previous
European owner added them to pass a safety inspection.  If you have to
pass an inspection, you might need hazard flashers.  This is relatively
easy to do, but will require extra work.

You can compare US and Euro color wiring diagrams at
http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/wiring .  Don't freak out about all the &quot;extra&quot;
stuff on the Euro diagram; most of that is the ambulance equipment that
you won't have.

I hope this helps!
