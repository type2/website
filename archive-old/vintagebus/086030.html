Subject: &quot;Little Miss Sunshine&quot; preview...

Hi all,

We went out last night to one of the sneak preview showings of the movie 
in a suburb of St. Louis.  Holy shit, what a funny moivie!  The bus (a 
white over yellow '73-'79 Bubble-window station wagon) is featured 
prominently throughout the film, and sort of becomes one of the 
caracters.   An off-beat comedy based on a very disfunctional family, 
I'd HIGHLY recommend your seeing it.  I may sign up again for one of the 
remaining previews just to go see it again...

Four weeks to go until the 21st BNNTA VW camping event over the Labor 
Day weekend.  Hope to see you there!
