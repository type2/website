WOW....I switched e mail programs today without posting an unsubscribe
or subscribe to the list. Do I get a prize for this...... HAHA

The question is: Has any one used the tank cleaner from Eastwood? Any
suggestion's on the best way to make sure I get rid of all the old
fermented gas in the tank. Part of the kit contains a chemical to do
this but was wondering if I should use some other solvent to help before

I start with their kit. If so what, paint thinner ect ? Also what works
better to help loosen the rust, an old chain or small driveway rocks?
Thanks to all you GREAT Volks.

I used no solvents, just driveway rocks.     Used the magnets on a cloths 
hangar down the neck of the fuel tank for a month after, as well, to pick up 
little bits o rust.     But i didnt have the thick gooey tarry stuff in that 
case, with the tar  scenario I switched tanks.  

sturdy beasts can take some impurieteies in their feed.
