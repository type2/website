Subject: Gabriel's Keys

Hello list,
Can anyone give me Gabriel's Locksmith phone #.

The one I have and that is referred to in every email that I have been able
to find on many web sites lists his phone # as (209) 475-0868.  When called,
the recorded message says that this # has been disconnected.
Thank you,
Ed
