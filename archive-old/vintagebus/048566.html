Here is a different angle:  (old farm boy rigging)

Being a &quot;what if&quot; kind of guy and finding a number of busses with froze
wheels, rusted lug bolts, no front ends and missing trannies, I decided to
design something that I could haul with me on a rescue mission that would
be easy to set up and take down.  What I came up with was a portable hoist
that goes over the bus that will lift any bus high enough that I can back
my car trailer under it.  It takes me about 10 minutes to set up the hoist,
or tear it down and the heaviest peice is about 30 pounds.  It uses 2 -
2000 lb boat winches for the lifting power.  It was built using 2 inch
square tubing, 1 1/4&quot; round tubing and 1&quot; round tubing for the truss
bridging.

As to date, I must have used this thing over 20 times with no problem.  One
person can set it up, it does NO DAMAGE to the bus and it always draws a
crowd (bet you never say a bus fly!!)  And I spend no time down in the dirt
tring to bolt  something to the bus.  Also, here in Kansas it is against
the law to have even 2 wheels on the ground from any vehicle that does not
have current registration.


&gt;&gt;The fun part will be taking my own front end there and installing it.
&gt;
&gt;This is one thing I'm gonna work on when I get time. Since most of the time
&gt;you find the rear-end (transaxle) missing of the 2, I fashioned a &quot;rear-end
&gt;dolly&quot; out of scrap that bolts to the tranny mounts. Man has that thing
&gt;come in handy! I swear I could sell a few of those if I had time to make
&gt;'em! Think how many times you find a bus without the rear-end. OR how many
&gt;times you've got it out to work on it and suddenly need to move your bus.
&gt;
&gt;You can see pictures of it here:

&gt;
&gt;Anyone done anything like this for the front end? I've got a bus I need to
&gt;haul off that I just might end up using is as an excuse to make something
&gt;up.
