So what happens if you're out in BFE and you have to remove a clamp, and
then re-clamp it?  No heat gun, no source of kewel clamps...  Why not just
stick with the old-fashioned clamps to start with?
&gt;
Oh, you're totally screwed, of course.  ;)

Naturally, you would either carry a heat gun and new clamp(s), probably in
some sort of fashionable kit with a leather-bound case and a triple-chromed
heat gun.  Only 13 e-z payment of $49.95 but if you call within the 10
minutes, make only 12 payments!  Or carry a 50c screw clamp and use the
screwdriver you already had in your traveling toolkit.

It doesn't matter anyway, most people don't have ~2 gallons of water with
them to refill the cooling system (and themselves) so they are walking out
anyway.  I suggest popping out the cell phone and park there in the heat
trying to keep the a/c going until your engine blows.
