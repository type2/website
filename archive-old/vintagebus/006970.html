Wally world works on a computerized sales system with the department manager
able to over ride allotments if there is a big turn over of a certain
product, you can go to any wally world and ask the department manager to
scan an item and they can tell you when they are getting more and the
quanity. I have ordered cases of Hot wheels ($54.00) dollars a case and the
manager will over ride the allotment and bring in a few extra cases that are
pre sold. The road and track comes in cases of 6 (so I was told) and there
is 1 bus set in a case. They will not get more cases in until the total
quanity of R and T toys gets low enough for them to order more cases.

 I ordered 2 cases (4 in a case) of the new HOT WHEELS 1/18 scale drag bus
and I just recieved these, (wally world couldn't/wouldn't order these for
me), this is one cool bus for the CUSTOM crowd.

hmmmm.
It's 12.96 in every Wworld I visited between Fresno and OCTO. There are sets
with jet skis on the trailer in a similar sized box for 9.96. Wonder if the
Mercedes list is scooping up their combo? Would they pay more on E-bay for a
model of their $50k vehicle? 
Karl listee found 1 in Fresno, I found 2 in Bakersfield. 
Anybody know the secret inner workings of a Wworld? Do they have extra items
out back? I was recruited to run the computer system for a new distribution
center about 60 miles south of here 6 years back. Didn't take the job or
talk to them in depth. They may have a JIT system that ships only what's
needed, centralizing the warehouse duties instead of having Shorty in the
back losing and mangling products. Just need to find the beer bar the
super-Shortys hang out in and have 100 sets shipped to my local Wworld.....

A dilema solved. Wanted to sell my 21 window that I haven't touched in 2
years, but decided to move it to the local metal-wizard for extensive
repairs, like the entire left side replaced from the windows down. Absence
will make the heart grow fonder, will be ready to work on it in the spring.
