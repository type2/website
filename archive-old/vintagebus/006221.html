cecil, go ahead and provide their names and phones, their are 6 major
wholesalers and importers of
vw and/or german parts in ths country, i purchase from all of them  and
between all of them the german bearings
could not be had , i have some connections in overseas  but i doubt that
they could come up
with all german bearings for this application,  as i have posted before FAG
the most popular imported german per se bearing
does not make these numbers due to lack of demand (as in the auto industry a
d or e mover) so that forces
them to purchase these bearings from an outside source as long as they meet
their specs. SKF were
never made in germany to my knowlage but originally where u.s.  made then
moved to mexico and canada
i'm sure that the new beetles, the type 1 beetles and the buses still
manufactured in mexico and brazil don't use german bearings and these
cars last forever even on their pot holed roads (don't count the new beetle
you can't buy them in mexico)
in my days of restoring 356 PORSCHE only on the concours perfectionest did i
use all german bearings and
seals, just in case they pulled a drum to check the seal in case of a points
tie, but used other import bearings
on the daily drivers.
in my 62 panel small nut tranny i have a combination of bearings, basically
whatever i could find at the time of
rebuild of the reduction boxes, this bus carries a load of over 1000 lbs at
all times and even more when fully loaded for a swap meet, i have put over
10,000 miles on these bearings without a bit of trouble, i have been selling
and using  imported bearings  since 1983 and can not ever recall a failure
in any car porsche or vw
i can understand your desire for all german bearings with the effort and
$$$$ you have put in your bus, i could
search and locate all fag german from some nos people but you would pay
dearly and i personally don't think
the cost would be justified, this is just my opinion

&gt;Ronnie,
&gt;
&gt;Time is beginning to run short.  I had to give the guy an extra $500
&gt;just to keep his building open for the month of January so he can finish
&gt;my bus.  I know this sounds ridiculous, but the guy is very good and I'm
&gt;proud to have him working for me.  Besides, it's Christmas.
&gt;
&gt;At any rate, I would like to have the best set of bearings and seals
&gt;that you can come up with by say end of this week.  Give me a list
&gt;of all pieces you have and a price for the entire kit.
&gt;
&gt;I must tell you three or four providers on the list saw this post and are
&gt;looking at the same problem.  I realize it is a difficult one and your time
&gt;
&gt;is what you are truly getting paid for.  The research alone is worth some
&gt;premium.  But if you can't find all German, sell me on why the bearing you
&gt;provide is just as good.  Maybe you can get in touch with these guys and
&gt;buy what they have to complete the kit.  I can provide you with their
&gt;names if you wish.
&gt;
&gt;We can do this in one of two ways.  If you take VISA, I can call you and
&gt;give you a shipping address.  Or I can have a credit union check cut and
&gt;sent to you.  I would prefer the VISA.
&gt;
&gt; I appreciate your efforts and your willingness to go a little farther to
&gt;get
&gt;me what I want.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks again.

&gt;&gt; you have really created a challange for me, trying to find all german
&gt;&gt; manufactured bearings for your
&gt;&gt; r/b has become an obsession to me, found seals, maybe nos gaskets, to of
&gt;the
&gt;&gt; bearings in german
&gt;&gt; and the other from france or japan, even though the boxes are fag the
&gt;&gt; bearings in a couple of them
&gt;&gt; were from france and japan,  found some INA german bearings but not late
&gt;r/b
&gt;&gt; sizes, the SKF that i got
&gt;&gt; were made in mexico and canada, also got some from india,korea and china,
&gt;&gt; the search goe's on

&gt;&gt; &gt;Ronnie,
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;This is my bus in March.  It now has the doors on it, with new VWOA
&gt;&gt; &gt;elephant ears.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;As you can see, both beams are out at this time.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;Problem is I want German all the way from side covers out.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;Give me a price, shipping to Marysville, California.

&gt;&gt; &gt;it would take me less then a half hour to put a r/b kit together
&gt;&gt; &gt;(depending on how busy i am at the time)
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;first; is it late, early or earlier r/b's
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;second; do want all german, brazil or ec (economic community) parts
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;third; there are some pricey parts that don't always need to be changed
&gt;&gt; &gt;do you want to pay for these if you don't need them?
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;this is why vendors don't have a kit per-say for this.
&gt;&gt; &gt;i have all parts in stock with options , i like to discuss your needs
&gt;&gt; &gt;before a sale
&gt;&gt; &gt;to help you save money and get what you want
