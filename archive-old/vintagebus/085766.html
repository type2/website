Subject: Re: $1500 parts bus

So.

Let's just assume there is little rust and the only significant  
damage is above the beltline.

Straight nose + unrusted floor + walkthrough section = $350 (midwest)  
- $500 (west coast)
Deluxe rear floor section, straight A and B pillars = $250 (midwest)  
- $500 (west coast)
Deluxe jewels  (rear bumper, trim, jailbars, clock, interior panels,  
steering wheel) = $650 (eBay)
Standard front bumper w/overriders = $100
Popouts + sekurit glass (possibly og front windscreens) = $175
Straight rear wheel wells and panels = $200
Cargo doors = $85
Front doors = $85
Misc lights, lenses, wiring, wheels = $100

Total = $1995 (midwest), $2395 (west coast)

This is a best case scenario, obviously. I'm not counting the other  
metal bits that are arguably harder to sell, but worth some amount of  
money to someone - i.e. spare wheel well section
