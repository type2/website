why three shims?    I always wondered this.   Kyle' s twisty expanation makes 
sense,  but why is 4 bad?   say you make up the space with 4 thinner shims, 
or 5?  Why is this a case of the Holy Hand Grenade .....&quot; and though shalt 
count to three, not two, unless immediately  progressing to three, nor shalt 
thou count four.  Five is right out.  and thou shalt lob thine Holy Hand 
Grenade at thine  Enemies, and they shall be blow to bits, in God's Mercy.
