&gt; &gt; Hi Courtney,
&gt; &gt; Doubt it!  Cheap oil is just like a cheap engine rebuild and usually 
&gt;results
&gt; &gt; in the same result of needing another engine rebuild.    Eric&amp;Barb
&gt;
&gt;Do you have some data to back this up?  All the data that I've seen shows
&gt;that, as long as the oil meets the API grade specifications, they pretty
&gt;much perform the same.  That's the purpose of having the API standards.
&gt;

I agree. If a oil meets or exceeds api standards its good for a bus. 
Consumer reports ran various oils in taxis around NY city and took apart the 
engines. They could find no difference after 300,000 miles in any engine. I 
used to buy only recycled oil but now its hard to come by. Your oil you take 
to the recycler is actually burned in ships. Oh well.
Ironically, you should avoid penzzoil (sp?) in your vw due to the high 
amount of parrifin.

Yep oil changes are often in the vw, and as long as its certified and is 
detergent I say use what ever is cheapest.

My engine has about 100,000 on it and it has been neglected, water has 
gotten in it, and it is old, but it still goes!!
