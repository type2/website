Subject: Re: [VB] Gas Heater

Unless you live in the southern climates, this heater putting out 5,000 BTU
would not get your bus even warm.  The little Mr. Buddies and Coleman
heaters put out this much heat, save yourself $550 and get one of those
heaters.

Even the little BN2's had 8,000 BTU, but everyone who has ever put one in a
bus will tell you they're not enough to get a bus warm, that's why
Eberspacher put BN4's in busses with 16,000 BTU.

Now if you want real heat, install a South Wind bus unit with 20,000 BTU, 4
times what this very expensive little propane heater puts out.  You could
have a very nice South Wind unit restored for much less than the $650 this
propane heater will cost and you don't have to worry about the danger of
having a propane bottle inside the bus.  In fact, in the US it is illegal to
have propane installed inside a vehicle or trailer, that's why you see all
the propane bottles on the outside of trailers.
