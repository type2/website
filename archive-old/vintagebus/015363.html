Dont forget that I too have a 66 walk-thru standard
with a good headliner, new tires, nice 70's vintage
Westy interior, all glass, pretty fair body, 1600DP
longblock to go with it plus clean AZ title for $1500.

Employment weakening at Boeing, &lt;thanks for striking
guys!&gt; wife out of work, new baby and my neurosis
strongly encourage sales of the '66 and the '54.

The email regarding the SanDiego swap meet kind of
pisses me off that anyone would pay $10-12.5 for a
&quot;mostly there&quot; starter 21 window project bus when they
could, with negotiations, get into the nice turn-key
&quot;all there&quot; '54 for similar dollars.
Talk to me. My loss is your gain. I'll keep the new
baby daughter. =)
