    The solution was accidental, I got some electrical contact cleaner from 
the computer suply store and drenched my signal switch with it repeatedly. 
This made my signals work consistantly(the purpose of spraying), made the 
flasher indicator on the speedo work, fixed the brake lights, and made the 
signal switch arm click more firmly into place and stay better. This stuff is 
up there with duct tape.
    
    I didn't connect that the wrecked sliding door was the one on vw planet. 
That hurts, I wanted that bus, and would have gotten it instead of the 60 if 
it had been closer. Oh well, at least no one was killed.
