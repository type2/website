Subject: Anyone heading from Oregon to Florida or SE ?
Date: Mon, 03 Jul 2000 08:43:54 PDT
Mime-Version: 1.0

Im looking at buying something in Oregon, but need to get it to North 
Florida or as close as possible. If anyone is heading east, please drop me a 
line. Its a bug, so only a towbar would be needed and I will buy that.

Thanks,
David
