&gt; I planned on just buying a few of those bug bombs and letting them rip
&gt; through the garage killing everything in or around, but thought I would
&gt; consult the collective list for any tricks of the trade.  I have three
&gt; more wheels to pull and expect many more encounters.


Now my problem isn't that I encounter them while working on the bus. I
haven't even seen them to tell the truth. All I see is an increasing number
of webs covering the dash.
Instead of spending the money on bug bombs but I am currently experimenting
with spider traps. They are just a piece of cardboard, sticky on one side,
not on the other, that folds over itself to form a little sticky tent. It
isn't working too well so I may have to break down and buy the bombs.

Instead of bombing a garage with the bus in it has anyone tried bombing the
bus itself?
