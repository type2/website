Steve, the two halves of the autostick oil pump are supposed to be isolated.
Eventually two pumps, one for engine and one for tranny, until the shaft
gets worn! Not a very good pump fro any real pumping power because of the
small 24mm gears. Get a Melling 30mm if you plan on running an external
cooler because it has sufficient pressure to pump that additional oil uphill
or wherever.

Bus content question:  While looking under a 70's Super, I noticed weird
oil lines coming off the oil pump and going to a small tank (upon future
inspection I realized it was for the autostick. I've never even looked
at an auto VW over so didn't realize the pump looked like that).  Is
there any reason one could not use that type of pump with the outlet and
return already plumbed into the cover of the pump to route oil to a
cooler or filter???  Why or why not?
