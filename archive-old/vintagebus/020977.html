Subject: Re: [VB] truck drivers on my road trip :(



&gt; &lt;&lt;As long as you were staying in the right lane no one
&gt; has any right to be mad at you.&gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; I disagree with you to some extant. Though I do feel it is proper to
&gt; move to the right lane when driving slower. But even in the right lane,
&gt; a speed that is drastically lower than the overall flow pattern can be a
&gt; hazard.

Many states have minimum speeds on freeways, usually set about 25MPH below the maximum.  I cruise at 58MPH on I-5 in the 70MPH 
zone and don't have much of a problem.  Trucks supposedly have a maximum speed limit of 55 in California, but they cruise at about 
62-65 normally.  Never have much of a problem or cause a backup.

&gt; In Germany, they start teaching children the rules of the road in
&gt; Kindergarden. They get additional &quot;drivers ed&quot; every year throughout.
&gt; Here in the states, drivers ed has been cut in many states do to lack of
&gt; funds. It's no wonder that many can't drive or even think.

It's currently popular to rag on the educational system but, at least in California, Driver's Education is a required part of the curriculum.

&gt; If I had to make a long haul on a highway where I knew the traffic
&gt; pattern was fast and there were many trucks, I might buy or borrow a CB
&gt; radio and let the truckers on the route know. I think in such a case you
&gt; might find them very helpful.
&gt; 
&gt; In fact, I think I will probably do just that. . . install a CB in my
&gt; bus.

Truckers usually don't deign to speak with lowly &quot;4-wheelers&quot; on the CB.  They're usually too busy brushing up on their 4-letter 
vocabulary.
