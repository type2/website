&gt;This may sound stupid......... but I'm really new when it comes to VW
&gt;engines.... what kind of gas does a regular stock 1600cc bus engine take? and
&gt;will I need to modify it in order to pass my inspection laws? (resident of 
&gt;NJ)
&gt;&lt;---- inspection sucks here.    Thanks alot for you time... please write
&gt;back.

The quick answer:  Use the cheap stuff.

The Long answer:  Your owner's manual calls for an octane of 91 RON.  RON 
stands for the Research Octane Number.  Cheap pump gas is typicaly 87 
R+M/2 which is the average of the Research Octane Number and the Motor 
Octane Number.  There is no direct conversion between RON and MON (as 
they are a measure of diferent quantities) but roughly speaking, 85 R+M/2 
gas has a RON of 91.

If you have modified your engine, all bets are off.  Unless shimmed out, 
flycut heads and a resurfaced crankcase will raise your compression 
ratio.  So will increasing your displacement.  Add a 009 distributer and 
leave off some of that *extra* cooling tin and the expensive gas may not 
be good enough. 

Incidently, a gallon of expensive gas contains less energy than a gallon 
of cheap gas.  &quot;Treating&quot; an engine to expensive gas that does not need 
it will reward you with worse gas mileage.  High compression engines that 
require high octane gas run more effeciently, more than offsetting the 
energy deficiency.

Regards,

Tom
