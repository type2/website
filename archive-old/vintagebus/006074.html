It's been a long time since I've had the chance to post another junkyard
story.  I've got one that I think you'll enjoy.

As you all know, I've been contemplating what to do about the gas tank
situation on my splittie.  After hearing that you can use a baywindow tank
and just how to hack it in I knew that was gonna be the ticket.  I got a lot
of emails from people that were more than willing to help but it seemed that
the people with free tanks lived too far away and other well meaning souls
wanted a little cash which would have turned into a mountain once the
shipping was paid.  Steven Reed offered me a tank but it involved a little
more driving/time that I didn't have.

So what did I do?

I took the afternoon off, drove to Paneitz Salvage in Fairbury, and got me a
baywindow tank and a ton of other parts for $35.  Not bad.

I parked in my same old spot, loaded up with the same old tools (hammer,
vise-grip, 10mm and 13mm sockets and wrenches, extension, ratchet, 8mm
wrench, and a screwdriver with std. and phillips ends all in one.  First off
I walked by a bug that I never paid much attention to as it's pretty much
stripped.  Upon close examination, it's an early autostick.  It's got the
turn signals from the late 60's and the 1/4 windows from the post 63 era.
The dash has a the space for the old square fuel guage just to the right of
the steering column.  The weirdo lockout plate it still on the tunnel and
the huge break/clutch pedal is still there.  The front bumper laying on the
front seat - however - it's the chrome over-rider bumper which was
characterisic of bugs up through 1967.  I can't remember if the head lights
were the glass covered ones or not but I'm pretty sure this has to be a
67/68 autostick.  I remember someone saying that autosticks came out with
the IRS rears one year prior to the standard transmission bugs with IRS.
It's weird to see an autostick bug with the early body style though. The
front bumper is in real good shape with minor rust on the back side.  The
only flaw I could find is that where the hood 'just clears' the bumper, this
metal is turned up as if someone bent it up so the hood would clear.  There
is another bug next to it - also with the chrome overrider bumper.  It's in
decent shape - only taking a small hit to throw it about 1/4 to 1/2 off.
I'm sure it could be bent back into shape and shined up.  These bugs have
obviously sat here for years.  This bug also has the smaller 1/4 glass but
the small, square back window.

Next I moved on to the splittie buses that I've picked from now for years.
I was able to get the brake line T fitting off of the tranny horns on 3
different buses.  1 of these is necessary when converting from a single
circuit master cylinder to a dual so I figured I'd go ahead and get as many
as I could because buying these fitting is not cheap!  The one bus has
really been plucked over.  The black steering wheel is still there but
absolutely nothing else.  The only thing I'd like to get is the front end
for the sake of the precious steering box.  This bus also had side scoops on
it which ripped off really easy.  There were made from fiberglas and
wiremesh.  I forgot them though in the back of a home made baywindow pickup
so I'll have to get them next time.

The next bus still has the spoon latches inside (some of them).  I'm not
sure what year it is but the rear hatch is narrow and has a t-handle on it.
This bus originally had the round glass taillights and they're now property
of Dave Easterwood.  Also I noticed that the latches on the doors of these
old buses were more like the latch mechanisms on the cargo doors.  The door
handles also are the pull type - you just pull the handle the door opens.

Anyway, in this second bus, the bench seat and back are ratty but the frames
are still there.  I though I had scored a middle seat that I had missed in
the past however, it's the back seat and the back in plain rotten vinyl.
The frame is still in decent shape.  It's funny - the back of the seat has
cutouts for the rear fenders and the middle leg is more like the point of a
&quot;V&quot; that simply rests on the floor while the outer legs are the actual
fastening supports.

Well I moved on to to my target bus - a 71 baywindow that I've plucked all
kinds of parts from in the past.  I also close the doors when I'm done
pulling parts - simply out of respect for the owners and the bus itself.  I
took the reverse lights out of it first thing.  Then I took the black
plastic spare tire cover (with raised VW logo).  It's cracked but I'll patch
it up and make it work.  It's been in this bus for several years and I
decided I'd take it and add it to my 66 just for s &amp; g's.  There was a V6
laying on the floor and underneath that was some red shag carpet.  I don't
know what made me do it but I grabbed the corner of the carpet and there
beneath it was was the original floor mat in protected, like new shape.  The
carpet stuck to it in places but I'll scrub it clean and throw it in the 66.
The mat between the front seats was also in good shape but unforunately, the
front mat was shelled from sun exposure and from normal wear and tear.

Next I set out to pull the tank.  Why didn't anyone tell me that those bolts
on the straps would probably be terribly rusted?  I think I sprained
something removing them. :-)  Also, I didn't know how to remove the cover
from the gas tank - after straining for several minutes,  I found out there
were 4 screws on the underside of the gas tank bay.  The cover came right
off then.  I also got the filler neck and the breather tube.  Sure was nice
to see the sending unit in the top of the tank. :-)

That about did it.  I also got some more carb throttle anchors (that piece
that goes on the end of the throttle cable on a stock carb.) and the angle
brackets that hold the back of the rear seat to the body.  Keep your eyes
peeled for the URL of  a weird parts that I found on this 71 Baywindow.  I
bet no one will guess what it is.

That's the story volks.  I told the owner (Vern) what I was doing with the
pars and he looked it over and said, &quot;Well, I think I should have $35 for it
all.&quot;

I drove home tired and dirty yet happy that I got all these good parts for a
decent price.  All the way home, Li'l Red just purred along, darting all
over the highway like he likes to do in heavy Nebraska crosswinds, like a
bat trying to snag one more skeeter before turning in.  So, a little more
broke than when I started out, I cranked up the stereo, passed a grain
truck, and made it home in 25 minutes.
