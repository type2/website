Subject: NC bus club camp out 6.29.01 thru 1.1.01

Hi,

After sufficiently recovering form EveryBus it's time to get things 
going with the NC bus club. We will be camping at Jordan Lake, NC 
(Triangle area) on June 29th, 30th and July 1st  at Crosswinds 
campground (Joel &quot;Diesel &quot; Wilson is scoping out the campground this 
weekend.  Preliminary reports from Mark Smith (park ranger and bus 
1966 bus driver) indicate that loop C will work best for us because 
it offers some duplex sites that will accommodate up to twelve people 
and two buses and it is just a nice loop.

Check out the web site for a info, fees, .pdf file of the camp ground layout.

I think we are going to bring at least one small sailboat (14&quot; Pintal 
) and a Prindle 18&quot; catamaran for water fun. Swimming and fishing are 
allowed but see web site for rules etc.

Many of the sites have hookups. It is not possible to reserve sites 
so just plan on getting there early.
