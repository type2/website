Hi David,
It's on the weekend of the 13, 14.  We should know since we came up with the 
Cascade Kombis club name!  The club had that date as tentative, but someone 
posted it too early before SIR (Seattle International Raceway) up here 
announced the date for thier VW show which is on the 15.  Below is the PNW 
events for this summer posted on our local Bow Wow parts stores website at :
