Subject: Underbus paint?

does anybody know or has anybody figured out what paint was used by VW to
paint or seal the underneath of a commercial bus? On my single cab it
appears to be a light gray primer, but most has gone away over the last
forty years and surface rust has developed. I would like to repaint this
area but don't know what to use?

ps. it appears to be different then what the insides were painted with.
