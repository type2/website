&gt; so- on the forward side of the bulkhead where the front seats rest.  look for
&gt; a 2&quot;x3&quot; plate held in by 2 little screws.   there is either a plate, the place
&gt; the plate was but has been removed from, or the body number stamped in (this
&gt; last on most 50s buses).  You can only see it if the seat is out of the way.

The plate I found in the engine compartment in the '63 is exactly the
same as the one I found in the M-plate location under the passenger seat
in the '67. The chassis numbers even match up on both of them to the
numbers stamped on the cars. It is a little 2&quot; x 3&quot; plate Which made me
initially think that this was the M-code plate.  If this isn't the
M-plate then what the hell is it?  Do you folks in the U.S. have one or
is this possibly the Australianism of the M-code plate?
