Yep.  Gear Oil.  Do tranny too as they are indeed connected.  Drive the
bus so the tranny and red gears warm up.  It's easier to drain and fill
the red gears if you remove the rear wheels.  Do yourself a favor and
warm the replacement fluid to about 100 degrees.  A bucket of hot water
works good (thanks Clara ;-}).  It flows so much better.  Buy yourself
some nylon tubing long enough to go from the tranny fill plug to the
side of the bus and ABOVE the fill plug.  Also buy or renta faily
intellegent helper who can pour.  Be ready for overflow with this method
so pile plenty of oil absorbing material underneath (cardboard boxes
work well).  Also be ready with some Vise Grips to pinch the tude when
the tranny's full.  Fill the redgear boxes first.

Dave
