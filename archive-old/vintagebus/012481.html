I have been reading all this info about sound deadener installation, basically
it sound like no matter what you do(except for tar)you are bound to have
problems. Has anyone read the info on the type 2 library about &quot;Heat, Rust and
Noise in VWs&quot;
by G. Matthew Bulley.

His ideas sound like another option. Although some of them sound quite
suspect, using that expaning foam for example. But I guess if it is used in
the right location, it shouldn't cause any problems, but in the wrong
location, and you are really stuck.

He also recommends this product called q-pads. Anyone else out there have any
experience with them? I guess I am hesistant to put anything that can't be
removed on. Because If I somehow screwed up(which never happens;) and there is
some moisture under whatever I put down. How can I possibly clean out that
junk?

Does that make any sense?
