I know we constantly talk about certain FARTS, I was
wondering if we could or should compile some of the
things not to do to a VW bus or look for when buying a
bus like:
Buy a GEX engine or has a GEX engine
Use/Buy chinese wheel bearings
Bondo
non C or D rated tires.
Buy a bus and drive w/out changing the fuel lines. 
Kind of a check list

Yes there is a plethera of knowledge in the archives,
but it is just a suggestion. I can manage but Newbies
would be thankful.  Maybe it is in Bob H's CD which I
will buy some day

This would not be page to talk about lowering,
watercooled engines, etc.  Just flat out dont's for
monetary and safety sake. 

I plan to give the 75 some lovin this weekend, it has
been very good too me. It and the tent served as party
central for 20 crazed bachelor party folks this past
weekend at Asseteague State Park/Seashore.  Got some
great looks and questions.  Have a great and safe 4th.
