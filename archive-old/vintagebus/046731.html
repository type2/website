&lt;&lt; I've been using hose clamps on cooler lines for many years with good
 results. I hear people say fittings/hard lines are the best way to go.
 Any comments?
 The oil pressure when an engine is cold is high, but I don't think it
 gets up to 100 psi or does it? &gt;&gt;
Hi Roger &amp; Trudi,
We have seen the oil pressure go over 80Lbs. on cold mornings of only 40F.
Before the oil pressure relief valve the oil pressure will easly reach over
300Lbs. and learned by having one oil filter implode.  Which caused the oil
pressure to the bearings to stop and then blow a hole in the outside steel
shell of the oil filter.  From then on we have been using Wix, and Mann (The
Mann filter we use is also for the VW Rabbit.) oil filters with internal
relief valves to stop the pressure in the filters reaching the point of
exploding when fall/winter cold starting the engine.  We also would advise
against using oil lines due to the fact that if they do not fray or get burned
by the exuast they can also fail due to manufacturing defect and/or badly
fitting ends.  Which results in a 200+Lbs. engine turning into a very large
paper wieght.  We use vintage EMPI oil pumps with the filter attachment cast
into them to avoid using oil lines.  Unfortunitly right now we know of no
manufacture of these type of oil/filter pumps that are worth a damn.   Eric &amp;
