 &lt;&lt; If anyone has a good set of rear corner (butt cheeks to some) for a 61 SC 
 for sale, drop me a line. Some did a BAD thing and cut the holes bigger for 
 those aftermarket round trailer tail lights.

you don't need to replace the corners to fix this- use patches.  Much easier 
than doing the whole thang, also truck corners are hard to get
