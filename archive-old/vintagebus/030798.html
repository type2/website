Subject: Re: [VB] ... a real 1835?

I built one of these about 15 years ago for my 67 21 window.  Don't
believe all the hype, it is all in how you build it.  For a long time,
1835cc was what everybody ran, then 2180cc when 82mm cranks became the
mainstay.  After about 50K miles, I sold the motor to a friend for his
71 westy (hmmm, haven't talked to him in ages).

I spent some time hanging around Gary Larsen when I was a teen and
learned quite a bit from watching him build drag VW engines for my
friends.  They all drag raced, but I had a bus!  His ultimate street
motor was either a 2275cc or 2332cc.  As I recall, the 94mm cylinders
are just as thin as 92mm ones.

My friends all drove their bugs to the races, raced them (12 to 14
second cars), then drove them home.

Rather than be concerned with engine size, I would be concerned with the
engine builder.

2332cc with nothing to put it in!  185hp

&gt; Hey Guys,
&gt;    I figure on putting about 2500 cold hard into my engine (regardless of
&gt; what size in the end I choose)along with a full set of gauges. My question
&gt; was has anyone built a 1835cc engine and if so what type of experiances have
&gt; you had with it...I did the math on it and I hardly consider a .059&quot;
&gt; differance in diameter to be such a big deal between the 92mm and the 90.5mm
&gt; pistons and cylinders. The physics of the matter would suggest that the 92mm
&gt; ones would have a better heat exchange rate due to the less amount of metal
&gt; surrounding the piston itself, granted the support would be lessened a bit
&gt; (not much). I would be more worried about cracking the cylinder than
&gt; overheating but, I have never built one so I would like to hear some
&gt; personal experiances with this engine. I have never actually met a person
&gt; that has built an 1835, only heard the urban legend that they overheat (who
&gt; started this anyway???). Assume all the stops in building a strong engine
&gt; (balanceing,endplay,deck height,etc..), I would like to do this only once
&gt; and do it right. I would very much like to run an external oil cooler w/
&gt; thermostat just for the added protection if it gets a little spicy. I
&gt; haven't made my mind up yet as to the size I would just like a little more
&gt; info on the oppisite end of the spectrum for comparison. Thanks for putting
&gt; up with this, talk to ya later!
