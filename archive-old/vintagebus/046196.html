&lt;&lt; Today I got my new brake tool from RMMW. It is a wrench with a 6 point
 7mm box on one end, an 11mm flare nut wrench on the other end, with a
 couple of offsets in the middle. It is made by K-D, looks very well
 made. The package looked like it had been hanging on the shelf for
 awhile... I can't wait to try it out!
  &gt;&gt;
 sounds like the one I got from Thom Fitz P,  The number is K - D 2024.

I used it, is great for the 11mm, the bends in the wqrnech are vera nice, 
clears the rim well.   The 7mm side is a bit thick , hit the metal line nut 
on the bug I was bleeding in the front (rear good), so I switched to my 7mm 
snap on wrench.  Thinking about grinding the K D wrench a little.
