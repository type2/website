&gt;Anyone down in the SE going to hit the &quot;Worlds longest yard sale&quot;.  It
&gt;stretches some 250 miles (AR to TN) I think. I'm not sure what highway
&gt;it runs along. There's got to be at least a few goodies waiting for
&gt;someone out there!  It starts tomorrow.  Go get um.  Sounds like a fun
&gt;vacation destination.  Why the hell do they have it in the middle of
&gt;August????
