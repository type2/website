Subject: off topic:  I just bought a 76 baywindow for $90 w/title

I just bought a 76 bay window and I don't know much about them. I thought
the engine in it was a Porsche, but I was corrected, I guess it is a type 2
engine? It doesn't look like a VW engine to me. It has a funny little hair
blower like thing hanging above the engine. It is a 190 C.I. engine
according to the tag on the engine door. I guess that is about 1700 or 1800
CCs. I hope it wont be hard or expensive to get running.  Any advice?  It
was cheep enough. I had no plans on buying a bay window. I went to the
auction to by a car trailer but I couldn't pass it up at so cheap a price:
$90.

Thanks,

Kevin Sullivan
