&gt; My steering box has about 4 inches of play in it (in other words, my box 
&gt; will go 2 inches one way before moving, and 2 inches the other, which is 
&gt; way less than my '67 westy, and I'm measuring this at the two arms on the 
&gt; steering wheel), and I
&gt; don't think that is excessive. 

Hi Charles,
4 inches of play is excessive!  You should be able to adjust your steering 
box down to 1 inch or get it rebuilt/replaced.   Eric&amp;Barb
