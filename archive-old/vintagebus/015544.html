Howdy all,

Several years ago, I &quot;loaned&quot; a local Bus friend my spare '67 wiper switch
so he could get a Bus together.  He was supposed to replace the switch
later, but now six years have passed and I doubt he's gonna come thru.  And
of course, as luck would have it,  now I need my spare switch for one of my
Busses.  So, could you please check to see if you might have a particular
wiper switch in your collection that I could purchase to help complete my
project?

I'm looking for a good to NOS condition VW part number 211 955 517, a three
position (off-low-high speed) windshield wiper switch found on late '66 and
'67 Type 2's.  The correct switch would have six electrical push-on
connectors on the backside of the switch.  We could use the correct &quot;fat
rubber&quot;knob also, but we really want to locate at least the switch.  Please
e-mail me personally if you can help by providing one for this Bus.  Thanks
again for checking out you stash!
