&gt;-'48 (according to him) bus steering wheel in very good shape.
&gt;
&gt;I'd like to see that one.

Yeah, I suppose it is really a very early fifties piece. Black with the three 
spokes. He also had the measuring stick for the gas tank and the 100,000 km 
badge, but he is not selling those. The bumpers are the late split screen 
type, slashed ends.
