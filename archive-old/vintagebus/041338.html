&gt; &gt;The plug covers the hole where the switch for the rear interior light
&gt; &gt;would have been mounted. Trucks don't have rear lights, so the hole gets
&gt; &gt;a plug.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Ok, so why is it that my 57 single cab doesn't even have a hole on the left
&gt; side at all? No plug, no hole, no welding, no bondo.
&gt; Is it safe to assume he must've had a pod installed from a non-truck, or is
&gt; my bus &quot;pre-plug&quot;?   =)
