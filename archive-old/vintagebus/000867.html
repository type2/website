-How about Too high of Compression Ratio?
 -What was your deck height?
 -Did you have your heads fly cut when rebuilt (that will raise Comp)
 -Are you running at least 92 Octane



As I did not build this motor from scratch myself, I have no idea what the
deck height or compression ratios are...
All I know is that the same motor, with the same stock carb. And intake
manifold and exhaust DID NOT run this hot a year ago the last time I drove
it.

And yes, I do run the 92 or 91 octane gas, basically the highest I can get
where ever I'm at.

As for compression, I get a solid 120-130 lbs on all 4 cylinders.
That's all I know....
