&gt;hehe... topic says it all
&gt;Why doesn't my bus start in the cold?  It started yesterday in 5 degree
&gt;weather...but now its -10 degrees.  The fuel is fine and there is no
&gt;water in it as I can see through my fuel filter.  It cranks, I even
&gt;hooked up my battery charger to it.  It comes close to starting....it
&gt;kind of coughs...but no vrrrooooom!  I'm just curious.  I could care
&gt;less today as I get a day off of school! woo hoo! hehe...
&gt;my mom's brand new D_at_dge Intrep!d won't start either...it cranks fine...
&gt;and it kinda shakes and acts like it wants to start..but no go.  It
&gt;almost feels like the timing is WAAAAY off ...but I know this isn't the
&gt;case.
&gt;
&gt;ITS JUST TOO DAMN COLD!!


Get a can of starting fluid in a spray can.  Don't spray while you are
cranking in case of backfire, but shoot a little in the carb with the air
cleaner off, then crank.

If everything isn't in top notch shape (compression, ignition, carb, clean
fuel), any engine will have a tough time in the cold, but I've started VW's
in -30 before, no problem.

If I remember my history correct, wasn't cold weather usage a must when
designing the first VW's?  And from what I have read, the VW's on the
Russian front were at times the only things that would run in the cold.
