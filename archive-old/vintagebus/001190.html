&gt;&quot;Yes.&quot;  &quot;What color?&quot;  &quot;Back to the original Dove Blue,&quot; I say.  50% of the
&gt;time, I see a look of &quot;yuck&quot; on their face.  Weird, Dove Blue rules IMHO.


I used to hate Dove Blue and only saw red or white over red or black over
red as the only colors I would ever want a bus but after seeing Dan Kinsey's
Binz and seeing a bug done in Dove Blue, I've taken a liking to it and now
it has become a color scheme that I would love to have vintage VW done in.

Dove Blue does &quot;rule&quot; IMHO! :-)
