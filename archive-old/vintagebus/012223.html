Subject: re;reduction box rebuild kits, the reality
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

all this talk of reduction box rebuild kits has got to me here are some facts
here are the brands that i stock and their country
of origin
INA- germany (oem supplier to vw and bmw)
FAG- canada and germany
SKF- usa, brazil and mexico
PRB- china
KML- no country of origin
SNR- france
HRB- china
these are the bearings that i have in stock, all are vw related, i went through the boxes to get this info for all of you, so beware just because
it says FAG or SKF on the box doesn't mean it's
german.
   i have had bearings in all kinds of boxes from 
all over the world, pakistan,india, mexico, brazil
france,germany, etc.
   at the SEMA show last month i talked to reps from both FAG and SKF and asked them why their bearings are from different countries, their answer was that there is not a big enough demand for them so they purchase them from whoever can supply them to them, as long as they meet their specs.
    so if you want german only find INA brand they are all german made in germany only (thats what they said) or use the FAG or SKF because it meets there specs, but whats wrong with SNR brand
can't franch make a good bearing.  whats wrong with bearings from mexico or brazil, do you think they import german bearings for the new type 1's
and the concepts, what about the new kombis and safaris built in brazil they seem to last forever
   so to sum this up just make sure that you get a quality bearing, reguardless of where it's made
it's your money.
