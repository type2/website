&gt; &quot;We are eliminating the modified classes and will no
 longer have awards for these classes...We also decided
 that we would only let show cars inside the park, this
 means no general parking, no non VW's, no dealers, no
 New Beetles, etc. We will still have swappers but will
 be more selective on sponsors and vendors.&quot;
&gt;
Big deal, whatever I arrive in will be a &quot;Show Car&quot; no matter what the
condition.  ;)

Make it &quot;67 and Earlier&quot; Bugs and Busses plus all Type 3s, Things, etc.. and
everything would be fine.

I think if they make people park outside the show, they better have security
to watch over the vehicles.
