&lt;&lt; If the car giving you the jump is a newer model &gt;&gt;

Also, NEVER jump your vehicle from a newer model with the jumpee's engine 
running.  His battery will start him up after you get started, but I 
certainly wouldn't want to be responsible for replacing somebody else's 
alternator!  Occasionally, a large battery drain will harm an alternator.
