&gt;i replaced my rear axle seal.after i replaced it  it was still leaking.i
&gt;found that it was leaking on the backside of the backing plate.its coming
out
&gt;were the oil drain passage meets the backing plate.there is hole in the
&gt;backing plate is there something i need to put there to let it drain back
&gt;into the reduction gear  housing.
&gt;


No, that weep hole prevents oil that makes it through the seals from fouling
the brakes. It is supposed to drain there in the event of a leak. Of course,
there isn't supposed to be a leak. When you replaced the seal, did you
replace the o-ring behind the spacer? And what year is it exactly? You know,
big nut, small nut?
