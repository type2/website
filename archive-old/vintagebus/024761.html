Woody is correct there possibly could be a few very early `65 hatches
out there..Westfalia, like VW, did not change model features on exactly
the date and serial number of the year change...that would be
ridiculous...and against any rational thought.  They used up the
remaining supply on buses until they were gone.  But as for a guideline
`64 was the last full model year for a hatch top...I can figure everyone
knew what I meant by that.

Woody ever heard of the old CBN newsletters?  lots of westy stuff maybe
you can get some copies?

&gt; &gt; By the way, what was the last year that they used the flip-top on the
&gt; &gt; Westfalias?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Most people will say 1964 was the last year but my buddy has an early '65
&gt; with the
&gt; &quot;submarine&quot;hatch.
&gt; What the world needs is a &quot;History of Westfalia&quot; book.
