I vote for DIY!  If you've tackled engine and brakes, then the front end is
very basic (like the brakes) abet very dirty work.  About the only specialized
tools you'll need will be some sort of bushing puller/pusher, a good torch, and
a variety of 2 &amp; 3 armed pullers.   All the parts are available (although not
all German) for a reasonable price.  I bet you could do it yourself for around
$200.00....not sure though.  Anybody else???

&gt; Or....should I do it myself? I've done work in just about all other areas
