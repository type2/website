He probably meant 61 and older, as 61's i think all had the pointy pod.
Rounded pod started in 62 i believe.

As an aside, a guy here in town has a 61 single cab from august of 60.

It has the one position non adjustable bench and the doors without the
indentations for the handles.  it looks original. (well, its lime green
and white, lowered with small nut reduction boxes, and has 145R15's on
empis, but i digress... its totally rust free, i couldnt find a speck! a
very nice truck.)

Our guess is it started production in the 60 model year and due to being a
single cab it was yoinked of the line for special bodywork, and then got
sold as a 61..

it had one 60 handle and 1 61 handle (they are different) so dont stand
too close on the drivers side when he's goin by, heh. he just ordered 2
new handles, they said they would fit a 61, but i know of nowhere that has
new 61-63 handles for $35, so i figure he got the handles he needed
anyhow, as his bus has the same doors a 60 would.

take care,

Steve
