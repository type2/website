Actually, YMMV. Oregon DMV folks just shrug their shoulders and tell you 
that they're not permitted to give legal advise.  I've been trying to 
title an orphaned Westy and the local folks won't even tell me which 
forms they need completed. I've contacted attorneys a couple times and 
they don't know the DMV requirements.... They'll learn. On my nickel. 
The Westy ain't worth that kind of money.  But I keep trying different 
angles... I'll get it right one of these years.
