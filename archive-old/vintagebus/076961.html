I'm getting very little power in 1/2 gear, and when I try to wind it out or 
do anything else with an amount of torque, I'm getting a massive vibration.
Hi Billy,
First check your spark plug wires!  If that does not improve power try 
removing a spark plug wire from each spark plug one at a time while the engine is 
running and see if it affects the idling RPM.  If you remove a spark plug wire 
and the idle RPM does not drop there is a problem with that cylinder and/or the 
spark, air/fuel going to it.
  As for vibration that could be due to unbalanced parts in the engine, but 
if there was no vibration when you last drove it 2-3 months ago then more 
likely you reinstalled the clutch pressure plate so its heavier side is aligned 
with the heavy side of the flywheel.  BTDT....
  If your clutch is slipping it will just mean on a flat road you can feel 
the clutch slip and grab back in a delayed kind of way when you speed up and 
slow down the engine suddenly while driving.
