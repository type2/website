I have seen a few get rich idiots trying to get
thousands for these things.  Funny thing is you see
them for sale but never see 'em sold.  Its a stinky
littel german trailer...every tom dick and harry that
owns one is gonna try to convince you this is the
rarest VE accesory.  Ok ok, there was an article or
two printed years ago showing a vw towing the puck but
NEVER has vw sold these as an accesory.  That was some
folks 'fabrication' to make theirs more valueuble.
Probably worked too huh!? Anyhow its an ok little
german built trailer which they STILL make.  They are
a dime a dozen in germany and europe...run about
$500-$800 over there.  That is about what they should
be worth....I figure a nice one here is 'worth' $1500
max.  If you spend more that is your gig if you wanna
buy into the fabricated hype.  It is your green, a
fool and his money soon part ways.

&gt; &lt;&lt;I will be making an offer on one and would like
&gt; some 
&gt; input on prices, what to look out for, info/research
&gt; 
&gt; sources, etc. It would be great to have for the trip
&gt; to 
&gt; the Red Barn and Kelly Park!
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!
