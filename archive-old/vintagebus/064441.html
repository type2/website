Subject: Transmission Gearing

Ok, my transmission (for the '67) is at the rebuilder's shop right now, and
I have a decision to make.  Should I go with a 3:88 ring and pinion or a .77
4th or the r/p with a .82 4th or the r/p with the .77 4th?  I'm looking to
be able to cruise at about 75-80 mph on flat road.  What do y'all suggest?
Could anybody tell me an estimated cruising speed for the highway for each
setup(assuming stock tire size)?  It's running the stock '67 big nut redux.
boxes.  Thanks.
