Subject: Re:  [VB] Wiper Blades`
To: cmjc_at_bloomington.in_dot_us, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

seen a number (6 or 7) styles of arms for splitty buses, and rarely does a 
bus have a matched pair.

SPlitty wiper blades are an inch or so longer than 67 and earlier bug blades. 
  though they fit the same.  osunds like RMMW sels the bug blade for bus or 
bug.  But the SWF bus wiper blades are ppricey ($25? ea)  and the bug ones 
are cheap.  I have even bought the cheapy blades someone has made in taiwan 
or somewhere, but they were under $5 and functional.   ACtually now I have 
the SWF blades on my 65 and I should get some new ones  (ouch)  I'll try 
cleaing them first.
.........................
Alright, I've read the archives on wiper blades, and I'm still a bit lost...
I have no blades on my bus, so I don't know the correct size that I need.
RMMW sells replacements, but it says that the early bug and bus blades are
the same.  I noticed that someone on the list said that the bus blades are
actually longer...  So what do I need, and where can I get them at a
reasonable price in fairly short order?

Also, the wiper arms I have are 2 different lengths.  Is this normal?

Thanks,
