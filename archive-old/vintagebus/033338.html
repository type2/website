 &lt;&lt; I would like to go to a tire taller, but not wider than the 165 R 15's. 
 This is on the 63 double cab.  I saw one at the Springfield show with 205's. 
 Too wide, couldn't get your finger between the tire &amp; the wheel well. &gt;&gt;
 Hi Bigdog,
 205/75R15 (about 26.75 Dia.) will work just fine on 1955-67 buses!  Maybe 
 what you saw had rim to drum adapters pushing the tires outward.  If your DC 
 is a 1963 with the higher and wider rear wheel wells than the 1955-62 buses 
 then you can even mount 235/75R15 (29&quot; Dia.) which we have installed in our 
 1963 SC without problems with the rear fender well.  The only problem we had 
 with this huge tire was light rubbing on the RGB spring plate lower stop 
when 
 jacked up to adjust brakes which we cured with a tiny amount of grinding of 
 the stops where it hit the tire.

I ran 205 75 R 15s on my 61 bus, .   didn't rub.   little tricky changing the 
rears, there was jsut enough clearance with the flat wheel wells.  but your 
63 likely has the later wheel wells, which have more clearance than the early 
ones.
