Hey all,

I'm tryin to reregister my bus on Thom's site and am having problems knowing 
what's what.  I tryed the m-code help on the site but my browser wouldn't 
bring it up.  My VIN badge is pop riveted to the passenger side of my roof 
vent.  My divider panel has been butchered.  Pretty sure its the right badge 
cause is a 66 and I have 66 handles and hatch.  Anyway heres what it looks 
like.  Grateful for any guidence...And Thom your site just keeps kickin 
harder!
