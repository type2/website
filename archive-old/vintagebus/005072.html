I had a Century brand flux core 110v welder.  Only a bad craftsman blames
his tools, but I couldn't weld with that thing for crap.  After almost the
same discussion on this list, I bit the bullet and bought a Miller 220v Mig
Welder (millermatic 172). I have enjoyed welding so much, that I have
tackled many more projects that I would have normally been very scared to
do. I just grafted in some semaphore posts in my oval, and have plans to
actually fix that rusted out Ghia 'vert that I've been having for a while.
My confidence levels have surely increased with the quality tools I am able
to use.

Just my Opinion

Subject: [VB] Time for a new welder


&gt; a few years back I bought an EASY MIG 120 from harbor freight at an
&gt; internet special of $135 shipped. It's a wire feed gasless mig welder
&gt; that uses flux core wire. I was doing some welding last night and the
&gt; el cheapo &quot;kissed the baby&quot;. I've been getting my mind set on
&gt; spending the dough for a REAL gas mig, so now I've got an excuse.
&gt;
&gt; I was looking at some Century brand welders today. Particularly a
&gt; Century model 130 Gas mig welder. I see it for $357 and it's gas out
&gt; of the box....so no extra money for a conversion kit. That's about
&gt; $57 more than I want to spend, but the best low dollar model for the
&gt; money I can find here locally.
&gt;
&gt; Anybody else use Centrury brand welders? What about the MODEL 130?
&gt; Any comments generally on a gas mig welder?
