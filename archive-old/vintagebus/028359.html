Good aircooled VW drivers usually stop for each other, IMHO, from the

upon. Besides, anyone &quot;in the know&quot; looks up like a prairie dog when
they hear a fweeming or fwooming VW exhaust, especially when they are
broken down. If I didn't stop for one... well, my conscience wouldn't be
kind to me.

I do that prarie dog thing.  I even know a couple dogs who do- see this VW
stuff can be caught by animals.   And the doggy we had would recognise the
sound of my 59 when I went to visit my mom- Mom said I had to go say Hi to
Daisy as the dog would be bouncing in the backyard all excited from hearing
the bus and knowing I was there.  She even knew that bus as opposed to other
VWs, as she didn't react the same for other VWs.  Pretty cool, huh?
