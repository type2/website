I'd normally say search the archives, but you can buy the flaps assy from
Gene Berg in SoCal. You need them. You may not hook up the thermstat, but
you must have the flaps in there and wired open.

our zero asks,

if flaps are natural working and all losey goosey lubed and the spring
thing is attached  isn' it natural open if the thermostat arm is
disconected? when I look through the puka (that's Pooka, Hawaian style;
hole) were the plastic plug wire loom snaps in (and vibrates out) it sure
looks that way...
Mr. Robert Bentley's bible says chapter and verse,&quot;5. Move the Thermostat
up, down to test flap operation. 6. PULLING (my bold) flaps shut ,
tighten bolt that fastens thermostat to lower arm of bracket&quot; amen

do I hear a amen?

aloha
