Hello I've been lurking for a while enjoying all the postings and I have
finally decided to get around to fixing up my 66 deluxe hardtop. Some of the
things like tune ups and replacing seats and trim I plan on doing myself but
I wanted a mechanic to redo the brakes. They are in need of new flex hoses
and slave cylinders. I took it to one guy and he told me it could cost up to
$700 to &quot;do the job right&quot; and that seemed on the steep side to me. Just
wondering if someone knew of a good mechanic in S.E. New Mexico and how much
something like this ought to cost.

Thanks

Dan
