My '65 single cab treasure chest doors have three louvers that point out.

I think brazil used a belly door which had two louvers that pointed in.
I dont *think* trucks ever did atleast through 67.

&lt;&lt; Thanks to Roger Nang I have a cargo door.
But I have found out there are significant differences,
I have a 63 single cab and it has the door prop not the spring holder upper.
I believe that the spring went into use in 65.
My 63 has 3 louvres that point out, the door off the 65 in the Sacramento 
junk yard has two louvres that point in!

So I have a repairable cargo door from a 64 single cab and want a 
repairable/good door that is correct for a 63 singlecab.

Any helpers &gt;&gt;
