yesterday coming back from dallas texas my single cab started smoking and lost power so i pulled off  i  35    ,i called the auto club to get some one to pick me up and they said it would be an hour and a half wait,while i was waiting a middle aged german man driving a jetta with 425 ,ooo miles on it and the coolist german accent ever ,and a lot of busch beer on his breath told me ,never park a vw on the side of the road because it gives jaquair a good name,he all said never let hammer boy work on your car,he did help pass the time.						paul   61 sc tx
