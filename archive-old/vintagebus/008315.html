hehe, just found this a little ironic.. vw relics have prolly 'just' got
this bus shipped in to UK shores from the US  :)
Glynn

&gt; should check out the UK based '51 Standard on Everett's site.
&gt; At today's exchange rate the price is $6,555.73 plus shipping to the US.
&gt; But, it's believed to be the oldest bus in the UK and certainly looks
worth
&gt; saving.
&gt; I suppose there's a UK news group somewhere whining about buses going to
the
&gt; U.S..
&gt; I'd rather see it in the US than the far east. But wherever it ends up, I
&gt; hope it finds a good home.
