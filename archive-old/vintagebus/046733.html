&lt;&lt; 
 So who is Bob Hoover? &gt;&gt;
 
 I heard a lot about his &quot;sermons&quot; on this list so I checked out said web
 sight.  They were posted by catagory, each apparently a response to a
 message board.  Some had copyright notations.  Is he just an experienced
 one of us who has particulary in-depth responses or does he have other
 published material?  Is there more out there?  Is he part of an active
 list?
 I downloaded all of the technical ones.  Quite a long process.  They are
 now nicely compiled in a single zipped document if anyone would like a
 copy.  I assume they are free for non commercial distribution since they
 are posted on the web site. &gt;&gt;

Mike (and the List)

I'm happy you've found some of my articles of interest.  But like many
internet users you appear to have misunderstood the copyright laws.  The
articles were posted publicly as a service, in exactly the same way a book
might be placed in a public library.  The fact you are allowed access to the
contents of the book in no way abrogates the copyrighted nature of the
material.  You are welcome to use the material, even to making a personal copy
for that purpose under the 'Fair Use' provisions of the Copyright Act.  But
distributing copies to others constitutes an act of theft.  

--------------------------------------------------

The longer our Volkswagens remain on the road, the more age-related problems
they encounter, problems unforseen by Volkswagen, problems not covered by any
of the existing manuals for exactly that reason.  I, and other experienced VW
mechanics, have offered advice that can keep these age-related problems from
setting your VW on fire, that can keep it steering straight and true, cause it
to stop safely and prevent numerous design flaws in the chassis and suspension
from resulting in catastrophic failure due to rusting.  We've even told you
how an engine designed in the 1930's may be boot-strapped into the 21st
century through the use of such things as full-flow oil filtration, electronic
ignition and other systemic enhancements that make the engine more durable,
more efficient yet easier to maintain.

The articles you've found useful were in response to a multiple number of
identical requests for information about a given problem.  When four or more
people asked the same question it seemed most logical to write a comprehensive
treatment of the problem and its cure and to post that information publicly
for the benefit of all.  People found the material to be sufficiently useful
to justify the creation of an archive of the articles -- the so-called
'sermon' files -- created and maintained entirely at their own expense but
with my permission and the understanding the provenance and copyright of the
material would be respected. 

This information was offered freely, without thought of reward.  But the
record shows this offering has been sorely abused by people like yourself.
The natural outcome of this abuse has been to squelch such information, not
just from me but from other experienced mechanics.
