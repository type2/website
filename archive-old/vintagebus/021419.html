Hi Todd,
Hey, relax.  Not sure what you mean about assumptions.  We have pictures and
photos of the Bastard 40HP engine with this half 36HP and half 40HP air
cleaner.  Maybe like you said that VW had production problems with this
particular air cleaner or more likely to save money they took this air
cleaners tooling and was modifying it to the 40HP with snout air cleaner for
the 40HP engine, so they just used the 36HP air cleaner for the late
production of the Bastard 40HP.  If so it would be very interesting to see if
there was a way to figure when all this happened.

&lt;&lt;-613 973 Chassis number,  -3536632 Engine number&gt;&gt;
Looks like according to Progressive Refinments that your bus was made in MAY
60, and the engine between 26 APR 60 &amp; 31 May 60.

 &lt;&lt; -5-`60 dated oil bath (identical in every aspect to a 2-`58 dated oil
 bath I also have)   Looks like that settles this dispute once and for all.&gt;&gt;
Well that supports that your air cleaner is correct and original.  The only
problem with this proof is that the K. Ghia used the 36HP engine through 1960
and so the one you have could be from a K. Ghia.  Like you said do not make
assumptions!
  Like we said we will try to find more written info on this.  Definitely is
looking like this Bastard 40HP air cleaner might have only been used on
earlier Bastard 40HP production.
