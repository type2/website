Hi,
Well then just sand the chrome just enough to accept the primer and then
paint.  We did the same when we could only find a chrome wing window lock as
a replacement for our 1963 single cab truck that had painted locks.  Result
is that the handle is not only protected by paint but also layers of copper
and chrome due to leaving them on!  Eric&amp;Barb
