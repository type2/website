Subject: re:underside update....

Just finished the undercoating today...

Got two coats of the silver primer-which goes on beautifully. Finish is
silver flat aluminum.

Then one coat of the custom chassis coating - high-gloss black. This stuff
is much thicker, and does not go on as smoothly-or does not appear as smooth
because of the glossy finish.

I like the flat silver look better-but I guess the high-gloss is probably
better for keeping stuff from adhering to it. The silver look also makes it
easier to work under the bus-as you can see everything. 

Suggestions for anyone else trying this...
-do it in warmer weather, my hands were pretty damn cold
-latex gloves work, and do not disintegrate. Unfortunately I got a big drop
at the wrist, and didn't realize it. So black wrist for a few days...it
doesn't really wash off.
-buy lots of foam brushes, as they disintegrate rather quickly. I probably
used about 20.

I still need to do the center section...but due to the weather around here,
probably won't get to it until next summer. At least I got most of the
underside done.

If anyone is interested in pics I can send them...
