 Are you talking about a screw in the hinge itself? The easiest way to take 
the doors off, is from the screws that hold the hinges to the body. What you 
will need is an impact driver and a mallet or an air impact. There is no 
screw inside of the actual hinge.

&lt;&lt; HELP! I have 3 days to get the cargo doors off of my '67 and I am at a loss
 on how to do it. I removed the little plastic cap/screw and I can not figure
 out what is holding the pin inside the hinge. Someone told me there is a
 screw but I do not anything but allot of crud. I tried digging the crud out,
 but I still do not see a screw down in there. Do I need a special tool?
 Suggestions, comments, advice? &gt;&gt;
