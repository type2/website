Subject: shift rod coupling

So I got that bad boy outta there as E&amp;B directed - that is, grinding along
parrellel to the bus and spreading the cut open with a screwdriver
(fortunatley most of my flat tip screw drivers work great for this as after
my bearing pull they are now tipless) and useing more loosen stuff.  I can't
see why  the coupling can't be welded, tapped and reused.  I think it will
work out great!

I figure now that I'm this far that I'll just replace the birdys that Clara
mentioned and maybe I should por-15 my shift rod while it is out.  Any
reason why I shouldn't por-15 it.

Unfortuanatly I took off the insulating grey plastice stuff off my heat
pipes and - DANDER - or at least a rust hole that I can put my finger
through.  So now I look like I'll have more welding to do - da*m.

&quot;Ah Grasshopper - are you beginning to see your bus as a process and not as
an end to be achieved.&quot;
&quot;Yes master, I think I am!&quot;
