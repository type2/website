Subject: [VB] touch ups

&lt;&lt;What is the best way to blend in the paint either for a large or small

area?  I'm not familiar with painting practices... so I'm not really
sure what to do.  I'd like to make it the least noticable as possible,
so that it blends right in with the shine and everything.  If anyone
could let me know, that'd be great.&gt;&gt;

Best way, of course, is with a small double action airbrush. But the
spray bomb will work too. Just not quite as well.

Fill the ding first. Then sand the area keeping it as small as possible.
Good prep is the key. Run your finger tip across it. If it doesnt feel
like a babys ass then it aint there yet. Now take your spray bomb. Put
it in a pan of water and heat it up slightly. Take a small piece of
paper or card stock and cut a hole in it. Holding it just off the
surface with one hand, mist the spray through the hole while rotating
the sheet just ever so slightly. This will keep your spray localized.
Let the first light coat tack up before repeating to keep runs to a
minimum. Now, coninue to build the paint up past what you think you
need. Let it dry for a couple days before wet sanding it out.
