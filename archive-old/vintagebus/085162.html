Subject: Fw: [VB] BBB XI Announcement

Hey Sam,

 No need to pre-register we will not run out of goodie bags and stickers
 ever again!  Last BBB we were overwhelmed with 1/3 more Buses then usual.
 We ran out of raffle tickets twice that weekend and that won't happen again
 either!

 The wheels are in motion already to have an even better &quot;BusesBytheBridge&quot;
 and we look forward to seeing you there!

 Lou in Havasu
