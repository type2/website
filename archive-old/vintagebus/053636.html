Subject: middle seat questions

I am looking at buying a middle seat halfway across the country, and was
wondering if anyone could help me out with a few questions.
I have a 63 deluxe that is suppose to have a 2/3 middle seat. I have found
one that is out of a 64-67 bus. What I am wondering is does anyone know if
the spread between the outer legs is the same? I know that 64-66 full length
seats are different than 62-63 full seats. Also I was wondering if anyone
knows if a 2/3 version is small enough to send via greyhound. I rember
awhile back there was some talk about this but it involved a full seat. If a
2/3 seat could be sent via bus, I was thinking that the grab bar and arm
rest pad should be removed so it is not damaged. Does anyone know if these
parts are just screwed in or are they riveted or something. Also if
greyhound will take it do you think it needs to be palleted or crated? The
seat will need to be recovered so I am not worried about the fabric being
ripped. Any and all responses will be greatly appreciated.
Thanks
Shawn
