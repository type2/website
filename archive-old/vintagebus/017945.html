Anybody got any idea what was used to caulk those
westy windows together, and to the body.  Its gray,
flexible, and stays that way, and is not silicon.  I
had used silicon before and I could almost not get
them out again.

Ellis spouts off...
The stuff is called &quot;putty tape&quot; and is commonly found
at RV supply companies as one source. Also try
window/glass places, Home Depot/Ace Hardware type
places. Always have located mine at the RV supply
outlets.
The putty tape is about 3/4&quot; wide and 1/8&quot; thick.
comes in rolls with a crepe paper wrapper. A couple
rolls of it should cost no more than $10.00 US even at
a rip-off price. I use the tape on window restorations
and between the access panel plate and the body part
of the ovehead fresh air unit. Vintage Nazis may want
you to use some rubber tape looking chit that needs
held in place some how. Screw that- it's your bus and
no one really G.A.S anyway. Offer the VNazi a beer and
congratulate yourself if that's all they can find to
be wrong. =)!

Lay it along the exterior edge of the panel van (e.g.
non-kombi) bodied buses window cutout holes prior to
laying the aluminum window frame against the body. In
the kombi bodied buses (with preformed window
openings) lay the tape along the perimeter edges of
the inner and outer frame pieces of the two-piece
jalousie windows. Look at your frames to see where is
was and make a note on disassembly from the bus. Might
only be on one of the frames... (it's been a while)
The two frame pieces screw together with putty in
between.
Be sure to order replacement gray rubber strips called
dust seals from Wolfsburg West, WCM or Ronnie's
OldVolksHome_dot_com. These dust seals are what you see
when you look at the outside of the typical pre-1968
Westfalia windows. These seals are *not* the primary
sealant against the elements as you might assume but
are the outer-most initial defense against the outside
world. Use the putty tape and the seals for a nice
seal between body and window frame.
The putty tape will compress and ooze out slightly
when screwing the frames into the EZ Camper/Sundial
buses and screwing together the two pieces of the
frames. Carefully use something like a wooden ceramics
detail tool to remove the excess. DONT use a metal
object like a little carb adjusting screwdriver or
X-Acto knife to do the deed. You will/may scratch your
new billion dollar paint job! (Don't ask how I learned
this stuff!! A lot of times it was the hard way).
Detailing the fit and function of the window glass
slats coupled with the rubber seal at the very bottom
edge of the bottom glass slot is the other seal.
Try your local Motorcycle connections for the person
who's  doing the aluminum polishing of all of the
engines. Have him/her do up your window frames and '67
tent railings. High chrome polish of the aluminum
items are not stock but looks very nice and will
eventually dull down to look right. Well worth the
cost and will save endless hours of hand rubbing with
Mother's polish or semi-chrome etc. *Way* worth the
cost.
Good luck! Re-doing the jalousie windows can be a lot
of work.
