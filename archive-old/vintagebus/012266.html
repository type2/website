Yes, these canopies look great, I'd go for it, but I also need all the bars to hold it up (the canopy looks pretty silly lying there in the bed without em.)  Does anyone have plans, or measurements I could use to have a set made or know a replica maker?

thanks,
dug

&gt;You might want to check out Dawn &amp; Steve at PLF.  They are making the canvas
&gt;tops only for about $700.00 [...]
