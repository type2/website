Subject: yup more talk of heat (defroster) fixed

thanks to everyone for suggesting taking a second look at the apparent
blockage. I put a wire fish down the drivers side again and got
nothing. However this time I put it down the pass side as well. turns
out there was a huge clump of insulation in the pathway. I now have
nice defroster heat :)
