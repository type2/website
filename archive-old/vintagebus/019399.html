Naval Jelly- can be found at any decent hardware store, and some not so decent
ones. It is this pink gel that you put on the rusty spot, it has some acid in
it that eats skin and rust. after putting it on, let it sit for a while, then
you wash it off with water. then try again. I think you need to cover it up
pretty quickly or it will begin to rust again.

ps check the instructions on the container for more precise instructions.
