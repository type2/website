I have had 1300, 1500, 1600 and 1914 engines and they were all going at full 
speed (rpm) just for gain a speed at 100 km/h, that's why I want to IRS my bus

Any idea, what to change (tranny / ? ) ?
Hi /lars,
If that is the problem then all you need to do is to have the tranny rebuilt 
with higher gearing.  Usually called a freeway flier tranny, with a 3.875 ring 
and pinion would get you into the 58 MPH range and a 3.44 would be more in 
the mid 60s MPH range, both _at_3,000 RPM which for us has provided much better MPG 
and double engine longevity.  If you have a post-early 1962 bus you have the 
higher wider rear wheel wells that will allow you a little bigger diameter 
than stock tires for a bit more higher cruising MPH.  Make sure to talk to your 
tranny rebuilder to keep the gearing between 1,500 and 3,000 RPM with no or 
very little RPM gaps between the gears.
  As for engine go for more stroke in the crankshaft (but not too much!) than 
just bigger pistons, this will give you more torque to climb the long hills.
