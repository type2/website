I can't seem to get the fuel line from carb to pump off for the life of me,
but while i was trying, i thought of something. should fuel be in the fuel
pump, waiting for its few seconds of fame? i have fuel in the fuel filter,
fuel getting to the fuel pump, but i remember lasttime i checked the pump it
was filled with gas. if it isnt, even after cranking the motor over, thats
bad, i would guess.
