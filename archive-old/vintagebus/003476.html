Subject: Parts for front end rebuild...

I'm going to be taking the 67 bus over to the shop sometime next week and
drop the front axle in anticipation of rebuilding it.  I've got an albatross
adjustable beam with the swing arm lever already installed.  Can anyone tell
me what I'm going to have to expect to replace?  I know I'm going with new
bearings and races, tie rods, hopefully the steering box only needs
adjusting, steering dampener, and since this is a 67 bus, I'm assuming there
is a chance that the king/link pins needs to be rebuilt or rebushed?

Thanks for any other parts you can think of that I may need to replace...
