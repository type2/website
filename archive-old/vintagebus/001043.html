Hello all,
		It is like a breath of fresh air to have the list sending me mail
again...I really began to sweat it for a while... I tried to find the answer
to this question on the type 2 super search, but it is , I don't think an
average question.

 Here it is:  I recently shimmed the barrels on my 1835cc motor to lower the
compression.  All went well, but now I seem to be having a timeing issue...I
have'nt had the chance to have it timed proper at the local shop, so I've
been trying to eyeball it with a static timing light and a careful ear....
It seems to be missing at all  rpms leading up to about 3000 rpm where it
seems fine.  bosch .009, webber progressive.

Checking the plugs has been a bit discerning.  First time checked, #3 was
glazed, as if not fireing.  I cleaned them.  &amp; headed out on a 4.5 hr trip.
She ran terribly the whole way...Pulled them again in Sarasota, &amp; 1 &amp; 2
looked ok/a little lean, and 3 &amp; 4 looked a little rich.  I cannot find a
vaccume leak anywhere.

 I was having a tranny swap done in Sarasota, and when crossing back is when
I noticed the rpm correlation.  Am I missing something?? Does anyone think
it's the carb??  Another description of the missing &quot;feeling&quot; is at the
lower rpms, while accellerating, it feels like someone is kicking the back
of the bus down the road....&lt;(crude but accurate...)

Any replies greatly appreciated!!!

Thanks ...
