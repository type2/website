Subject: RE: [VB] Spacer for 34pict3

When I was repairing my old 65 DC so that it would be legal on the road
about 15 years ago I found the same thing. I had put in a new 1600DP with a
34PICT-3 and my air cleaner hose didn't fit either. Since the 71 westfailure
was waiting for the tranny to come back from the shop and there were plenty
of 68-71 buses laying around at that time, I just swiped the one off of it
for the DC and replaced it with a wrecking yard part later.

I must be looking wrong at this or something because I'm sure lots of
people run this.  I have a 67 bus I&quot;m putting my spare 1600 DP with
34pict3 in.  Using the stock air cleaner, the rubber connector hose seems
a little shaky.  The carb is below the air cleaner enough that it seems
like the rubber hose is probably stressed too much by the time the engine
starts shaking around and all.  Is there a spacer for this?  The 30pict
spacer would be too small and too tall.
Thanks,
JOhn
