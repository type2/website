 So I'm going to tighten up my rear wheel nuts and I thought I read somewhere
 about how to figure out how much torque I am applying.  That is, by knowing
 my body weight and the length of the pipe I have welded to the socket ... ya
 know?
 
 I see that St. Muir just says to get em as tight as you can .... I'd rather
 have the formula.
 
 Anyway, I'm kinda spaced out after a 3 hour exam ... pls don't ask in what
 subject.
 
 TIA

i aim for about 220 ft lbs.   If you weigh 220 lbs, stand 1 ft out on the 
breaker bar (no cheater pipe needed.)  if you weigh 110, stand 2 feet out.  I 
weigh inbetween, and stand inbetween way out.   then push it to the next 
notch to fit the cotter pin.  very scientific.
