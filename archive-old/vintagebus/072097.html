Hi Kevin,
Close!  You really need to remove all tin except the piece just in front of 
the crank pulley.  Also best to remove heat exchangers.  With all this 
removed one can get a torque wrench to seven of the eight big case nuts, the 
last one we torque by hand with a open ended wrench.  Then retorque wrench 
all the 13mm nuts/bolts around the case seam, &amp; lastly the sixteen head nuts. 
 
  Before we went to CW crank, and thermostatic flaps we pulled our engines 
after 500 miles and about 40,000 miles.  The latter milage the the fasteners 
on the big eight case and heads nuts were very loose.  Now with CW crank and 
thermostatic flaps when we retoque at 40,000 miles the nuts only need just a 
few Lbs., instead of almost being just finger tight!
