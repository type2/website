Subject: Re: [VB] Dual Carbs and oil breather (QUESTION)

I wish to thank Isaiah and CR Sauls for their suggestions on what to do with
the breather hole on the oil filler.  One suggested that I run rubber lines
to breather holes on the valve covers and yet another one suggested that I
run them into the aircleaners on the dual webers.  Either way it sounds like
it would work well.  I don't exactly want to drill and bore holes in the
tops of my filters but at the same time I don't like the idea of having to
run rubber tubing all the way down to the valve covers because how in the
heck do you get the hoses all the way down there when you you are supposed
to seal the top area of the engine from the bottom?  Maybe this a tinware
modification that should have been done - install a little tube right in the
rin as a &quot;passthru&quot; that your hoses could connect to and then a short length
of tubing underneath to the valve cover.

Thanks for the ideas though - I'll be thinking them over at work today...
