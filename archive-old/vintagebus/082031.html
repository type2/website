&gt; OK guys, I know I can puzzle this out eventually but wanted to quiz the
&gt; collective to see if anyone had run across these symptoms before.

&gt; My bus fires then quits as soon as I release the starter.

Our bug had similar symptoms a few years back.

Wierdest thing.  Car would start and idle fine.  You could rev it up fine.
You could put it in reverse and accelerate backwards fine.

However, put it in first gear and try to accelerate forward and it would
buck and backfire!

Turned out that the wiring harness insulation had worn through where the
harness bends around the fan shroud.

A few turns of electrical tape and the problem was solved!

Try wiggling your harnesses around and see if the problem changes or goes
away.
