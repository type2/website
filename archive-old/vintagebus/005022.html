  I think that nobody wanted them , panels anyway, and kept passing on
buying them. Now that splits are getting so hard to get people are buying
them because thats all thats left. Kind of like the camper bus craze now. I
Remember a time ago when no one wanted campers either. Come to BBBV and see
the largest gathering of DD buses ever. Think the record is Jerome 9 and
nine DD's.  The guy that rebuilds tranys in riverside ( he advertises in Hot
VW ) has a 58 DD panel for sale. Missing bulkhead and cut wheelwells.

See ya at BBBV
