Hi all-

It was a long but nice trip to the Sac Bug-O-Rama this
weekend.  Huge show, lots of swappers, beautiful cars and
busses,  and nice warm days.

Left Friday evening with the Ford  van with a crew cab on
the trailer and a few other odd and ends for parts.  Figured
I would try my hand at swapping for once and see if I could
find a home for the truck (actually praying that I would not
have to tow it back home).  Long drive with the trailer and
truck in tow, took almost five hours.  Not far, just a lot
of hills to wind through from the coast.  Got to the show
Saturday afternoon before the gates opened and knew at once
it was going to be a good turnout when the line circled the
large parking lot and went back to the pavement .  Met lots
of old friends there from my previous hometown.

The show was huge!  The largest I've seen.  The swap area
was 4 rows for a 1/4 mile as the swap spaces started at the
bleachers in the pit area and ended at the go-back for the
draggers (or is it a 1/8 mile drag???)

Scored majorly for the wifes ‘67 21 Window.  Found her a
cherry complete rear deluxe bumper with trim.  Something I
was looking for  a long time.  The best find of the show
(for me anyhow....) was a complete set of seats (yep, front,
middle, and back) from a  23 window. But the best part is
the fact that they were already had new upholstery.  Never
installed.  Never seen this before offered at a show.   All
I have to do is attach the top straps and luggage bar
(included).  They were oatmeal tweed and tan vinyl, exactly
what I was going to do!!  Free seats, the price of all of
them was way less than the cost of new upholstery material
and close to the price  the Bus Farmer dudes were asking for
just one ratty middle seat (noticed they still had them at
the end of the show.......)  The seller apparently gave up
on his bus, and was offing lots of deluxe parts for little
$.

Met Clara for the first time.  Never seen her before.  Saw
this lady buying an early fan-shroud-to-air cleaner
bracket.  Figured since most (if any) women would  not know
what such a part is, it must be the female bus guru from
Washington.   Ask her, and yup, it was Clara.

  It was a real pain in the rear-end swapping and wont do it
again.  Not as much time as I would have liked to look
around at the cars and scrounge for parts.  Hate having to
sit in one spot with so much going on around me.   I did
have a few friends that threw parts in my space and we took
turns at watching the space.

Didn't sell my crewcab until the very end of the show as I
was loading it on my trailer for the ride home.  This was
something I definitely was not looking forward to as I was
supposed to hook up with some friends camping already.  The
last thing I wanted to do was drag 1 ½ tons of trailer and
truck home through the mountains.  As it turned out, the guy
that bought it was from my town too, and I ended up towing
it home for him any ways!!  I offered to drop $300 from the
price and loan him the trailer if he would take it home.
Nope, I was stuck with the tow.  Damn.

Not wanting to rush and tow at the same time, we ended up
staying in old Sacramento for the jazz festival and
partying.  Great times and actually was much better that the
camping plans sounded.
