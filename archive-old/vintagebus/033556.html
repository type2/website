 So I got the engine, gas tank, and transasxle out with almost no problems,
 but I did have a stuggle getting that coupler thingy apart,  it looks like I
 have to do some brake shoe replacement and shocks.  I'm interested in what
 others do for rear break drums for pre 63 buses. I've had my turned and they
 look fine but I recall reading somewhere that getting brake drums turned as
 not a good idea ..... I've also heard that it is possible to get drums
 relined but I've also heard that it is illegal to reline drums.  What is the
 story?
  &gt;&gt;
if they are grooved I get them turned, if they are smooth I just rough them 
up with some 80 grit.  Didn't turn the ones on my camper and if  I stomp the 
brakes things go flying forward.   Turned the ones for Krista's camper, they 
were pretty grooved, which for brake drums is not good.
