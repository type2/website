The Pleasure of Putting

As I was driving to work yesterday in my 1970 hardtop
Westy, I got to thinking. Which is what I always do
when I drive my bus. That is the beauty of it.

You see, the old girl rarely gets above 55 mph, which
isn't bad considering her age. Sometimes she will perk
up to 60 on a downhill grade, remembering her salad
days in all their glory: when there was nothing up
ahead but open road and sunny days; wanting so
much to get there before it was too late.

But soon, the reality of the aching ball joints sets in,
and she abandons nostalgia to resume her usual
determined gait. She knows the route by heart. It's all
been seen and done, the petals have all unfolded, the
birds are flown. But, as will happen, the oil change
which was once a nuisance is now looked upon with
anticipation. She derives joy from the simple things
in life.

The old girl will always wave to a New Beetle, wanting
nothing more than to sit down for a nice long talk.
Wanting to tell the Beetle how it was in the old days.
She was THERE! She was DOING IT! But the Beetles
rarely have the time. They can't seem to settle down to
the rambling pace of an old, broken down bus. And
what's more, do not even know what THERE and IT
are, except for what was glimpsed in an old movie one
night while changing channels. The times, they are
a-changed.

But I digress. Which is precisely the point. But a digression
from a digression? An infinite regression of digression? Or
maybe perhaps just indigestion.

We were talking about slowness. Which, mathematically,
can be defined as the multiplicative inverse of velocity.
S = 1/V, if you will. And we all know that no vehicle can
achieve the slowness that the good old VW bus can.
From infinity to 0.016 hours per mile in more than 20
seconds. Who can argue with statistics like that?

Now, the interstate is posted at 65, which means that
most folks whip by at 75, undaunted by the police who
are only looking for statistical outliers. Which, on a two
lane interstate, presents a problem to the old bus. She
is a rolling traffic jam. Or rather, a problem is presented
for everyone else.

The whippers-by come in two categories. First are the
ones who look wistfully at the old girl, if only for a moment.
Perhaps remembering their own days gone by. Perhaps
remembering the college roommate who, perhaps, used
to haul the crowd around in the &quot;Blue Streak&quot;, perhaps
doing things that will come back to haunt them if, perhaps,
they ever run for public office.

But the second category seems to outweigh the first. These
are the get-that-goddamned-thing-out-of-my-way folk. The
I'm-still-stuck-on-mile-marker-173-when-I-should-be-on-mile-
marker-174 people. The there's-a-break-in-traffic-so-I'd-
better-gun-it pack. The I'm-going-to-be-late crowd.

The thing is, when you are putting along not passing
anyone, not constantly jockeying for position in traffic,
your mind is free to wander. Most people, I hope, love
to daydream. But constant worry about traffic conditions
will keep you from doing it. As will the car radio. In
fact, most people including myself go to great lengths
to stay away from the boredom which gives rise to
daydreaming. One word for these extraordinary measures
is &quot;entertainment&quot;, which is derived from a Latin root-word
meaning &quot;die Creative Thought, you scum sucking pig&quot;.

But when one is putting along in a radioless bus, it seems
that one cannot stop the mind from rambling. The thoughts
keep coming in an unbridled flow of association. A bareback
wrangle through the countryside of your mind. A deep
sea voyage on the Calypso of your brain. A cheesy
metaphor in the dimestore novel of your soul.

Which is how I like it.
