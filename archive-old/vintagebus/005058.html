Subject: Wolfgand Disc Brake Conversion * Epilogue

  In our last episode, the installation of the disc brake conversion was
complete, awaiting a second bleed and some road time before I posted my
final impressions. After driving with these brakes for a while, I realized
that, while the pedal came up some on the second pump, there was no
sponginess on the first stroke, and if I set the e-brake (while stationary
of course), the pedal came right up to the top (!). I suspected the rear
brakes and adjusted the shoes. Now the pedal is right up at the top, almost
too high. I may back off the push-rod a little to bring them down to a
comfortable height.
  After 600+ miles to the OCTO/Classic weekend, I can say without hesitation
that I am very happy with the performance of the brakes. I still have not
sensed any need for the pressure equalizer, but I didn't make any panic
stops, either. I do not detect any difference in the feel of the pedal, the
brakes just continue to apply more force as you press harder on the pedal,
as opposed to the feeling of helplessness that rises from the pit of your
stomach when you try the same thing with drums.
  In summary, this conversion rocks. It is simple, easy, and requires no
irreversible modifications to the bus. From the safety aspect, I would rate
this as the most significant upgrade you can do to a bus. From a performance
aspect, I would rate it #2, with the freeway flier transaxle being #1.
