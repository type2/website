allow me to quote just so you know and can take a guess...; &quot;please send us,
therefore, in cash for 10DM per vehicle enquiry and note on it the chassis
number of your vehicle&quot;...funky wording but that's word for word what they
said. I'm guessing that sentence means a ten DM  CASH bill with your VIN
number written DIRECTLY on the front of the bill. I was told 10DM is about
20 bucks but I'm not sure..... oh almost forgot, at the bottom it said
&quot;please allow us 4 weeks to carry out this research&quot;.
Heres the address where my letter came from
STIFTUNG AUTO MUSEUM VOLKSWAGEN
Dieselstraﬂe 35 - 38436 Wolfsburg

&gt;Hello, to all.  Just read Wades post about getting info from Wolfsburg.  I,
&gt;too, would like to send away for info.  My question is:  How much (US) is
&gt;10DM?  Or do we need to send German money?  Thanks in advance for any info.
