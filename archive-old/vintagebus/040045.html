hmmm... how to sleep a 6' 3&quot; frame in a 5' 11&quot; bed... diagonally of course! 
unless there will be two in the bed, then your feet will just have to hang 
off :-) whats nice about my SO-44 interior is the closet is placed behind 
the driver... that way i have a full-width bed in the back, its quite 
spacious. but i smack my head on the larger cabinet over the back.

Bob
