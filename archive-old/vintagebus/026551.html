well...its in the garage now...
I put the heater under the motor and it still wont start.  It sputters a little
here and there.  I'm going to do the valves now just to make sure.  The garage is
warmer now since I put the dryer on :)  (dryer vents into the garage)
and some ice is melting...so i know its above 32 degrees.  it almost seems to be
flooded....
I think I'm going to switch to a thinner oil now due to cold weather.
I'll clean up some more terminals and see how it goes.  The choke is adjusted
fine and is working properly.

we'll see how it goes

I even have a battery charger hooked up to that sucker
