&gt; Not sure how that would work with the C-clip is pressed up against the left
&gt; side of the bellhousing and this might damage the electron alloy with
&gt; scraping.

Hmm, my circlip is up against a washer that in turn bears against the fat
bushing that goes between the shaft and the bell housing.  I used a
carbide tool in a dremel to make a clearance groove in the washer for the
safety wire.  I haven't had it apart since, so I can only assume that it's
still working.
