Hi list,

To continue my chattering engine/clutch saga...
The weather cleared and I was able to pull the engine this evening. All the
pressure plate bolts were tight, the TOB was in place (though I'm now
wondering if it is the correct one), and the gland nut was as tight as
usual. The clutch was dry, so the new engine main seal did the trick there,
but why is this engine chattering?  Everything looks ok to me... I called
around to some local VW shops and all the mechanics had vague descriptions
as to what may be wrong.  I've narrowed it down to:
A. Wrong TOB... but how to tell for sure?
B. Flywheel needs re-surfacing...looks shiny and feels smooth, how to tell?
C. Gland Nut needs replacing....once again, how to tell?

Another kinda weird thing is when I removed the gland nut the flywheel came
off very easily. This time, I had to work it back and forth and lightly pry
with a screwdriver. When it finally came off, one of the pins was stuck in
it and ripped the light paper gasket. I pushed the pin out and re-installed.

And finally, with the old clutch I heard a chirping when the clutch pedal
was pushed to the floor, once released the chirping went away. What does
that indicate?

Thanks again for all your help. I would be lost without the advise.

Tom
