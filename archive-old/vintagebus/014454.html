&lt;&lt; Howdy all...
 
 I've got a problem, and I hope you can help.
 
 I need a swing lever arm pivot pin bushing kit.  I understand that it comes
 with the upper and lower bushings and the reamer to ream the new bushings
 out so the pin will fit.  I've called WCM and RMM, and neither have the kit.
 Does anyone know where I can get one??
 
 Thanks

Just about any VW place worth their salt can get you &quot;a swing lever kit&quot;, the
shop I use does, this kit contains the bushings and a new pin.  As for the 21
mm reamer, I've been hope'n to stumble into a affordable one for years!  I
once had a friend at a machine shop make one and I've been trying for the past
ten years to get him to cut loose with it!  You might try the web for the tool
but if your only gonna use it once, it maybe cheaper to farm out the reaming.
   Peace, Love, and if you do find an affordable source for the reamer--I
think a lot of listees would love to have one!!  Maybe we could bulk order
them?
