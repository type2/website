Subject: RE: magnet/metal flakes

I believe you can put the magnet inside a pair of pantyhose or &quot;trouser
socks&quot; (calf-high pantyhose) and when it's covered in metal flakes, pull off
the hosiery... wash... reuse. It may not work if the flakes are too small,
but I think I've heard of this method being used to keep that &quot;impossible to
remove&quot; tiny metal pieces from getting on the magnet to begin with...

...You will probably never get the flakes off the magnet.  The next hard
drive magnet you get, keep it clean and you can attach the magnet to
stuff that you want to be on your dash with no holes in the Bus.
