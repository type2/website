My search for a '67 Westy walk-through has turned up a couple of potential
winners. Any thoughts on the safety and other operational aspects of the
optional gasoline heater? (carbon monoxide issues, etc). I want to USE this
Westy and the idea of the gas heater sounds neat, but I want to be
realistic about safety issues. Thanks in advance for your thoughts!

the exhaust has a tailpipe that vent near the muffler tailpipe- it is not
vented into the VW.    I have used a Eberspacher, and it seemed perfectly
safe.   After a bit I learned not to adjust the heat output (just on and off
were okay) as it would shut itself off and I'd have to flick a switch on the
heater to get it to start again.  At first the groovy red light glowed when
the heater was on, but that stopped working.    And it used gas, making the
milage go down if used a lot.  BUt the thing was 30 years old, and seems like
it could have used a tune up or something (it wasn't in my bus), and I've
heard from people (recent gas heater thread) that their's don't use noticable
amounts of gas, and that it  is a service issue.  It was nice when the bus was
first started to warm it up and defog *all* the windows,  and when it was
below freezing outside, but after the bus warmed up, the stock heat was plenty
(I turned it down), due to stock heat functioning properly and good door seals
(aka pop bottle effect).  This is in the PNW, with normal winter temps being
40s at night, 50s in the day, and high humidity, though there is a short time
of hard freezes/snow.
