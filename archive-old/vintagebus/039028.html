&gt;How common is or how many were made of the single 
&gt;cab ute's with no air vents on the side of the vehicle. 
&gt;The over head peak on the cab is alot longer to channel 
&gt;the air to the motor.

Huh???  First off, what is a &quot;ute&quot;?  Second, what do you mean by the &quot;over
head peak on the cab&quot; and how is it going to channel air to the motor?  And
third, a single cab with no air intake vents for the engine is a single cab
that is going to last about 15 minutes before the engine seizes.

Sorry.  I'm not trying to be a smart ass (that comes naturally to me), but I
can't make heads or tails out of this question.  Got any pictures?
