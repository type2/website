In hopes to kill the Walmart Bus issue I would like to bring on the next item for debate.  In a student lounge at the university I work at there is a pinball machine with a split window bus in it.  Unfortunately the pinball game is called Junk Yard.  Anyway, since I am borrowing the digital camera for the weekend I took some pictures of it.  You can see it at:

I haven't played the machine, the university does not own the machine but if someone is willing to pay lots of money for Walmart Buses and real buses without bumpers and you need this pinball machine for your collection, then I would be happy to see if the machine could be for sale.  Of course I would expect the standard 1000% mark up.  Seriously, it's Friday, I'm going home shortly but if you are interested I will respond to your email on Monday.
