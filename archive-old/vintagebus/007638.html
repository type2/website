Man I tell you guys what - for my first time at a bus event, I REALLY (and
that is an understatement) had a blast!  I met so many listees and the
engine ran wonderful.  I'm in the process of copying all 246 pictures to my
hard drive.  Terry and Rob have about the same to contribute.  A well
documented event to say the least.  Rob's new single cab runs great!

I met Shawn Hunt and Isaiah from the list as well.  Great people!  I've made
some great new friends.  The best part was the photo shoot we did Sunday
afternoon at a secluded lake called South Lake south of Monroe City, MO.
All 5 buses in various staged photos - we all had a blast.

I have 401 messages to reads and pictures to copy so the full write up will
come later...
