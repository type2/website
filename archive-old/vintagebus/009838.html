well now that makes sense, now your talkin, is there anything special about
the glass? how much do they cost to get cut? i think ill have a couple extra
made and sell them on ebay and use the money to buy some safaris :)

&gt; a couple of years ago on the lists, everyone was recommending that if you
&gt; have a busted windshield on your split, just go get one cut to fit and
&gt; drive away....
