Subject: Re: [VB] re:[VB] Its a boy! take that VWOA!!!

&gt;Wade's son was named Kafer.


DANG it! the s/o and i are bantering names (yes, that stuff they warned me
about in health class has happened), and she actually LIKED the name
Kafer... but now  its been done :P

she did ask what the name for a bus was; i am fine with Bulli, but she has
doubts.

i am trying to sell her on Kubel.
