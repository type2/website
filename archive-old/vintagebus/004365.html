The set up you are looking for is from early type 3. There was a year possibly two (makes 'em hard to find) prior to the injection that had dual Solex. To mount these with the type 1-2 fan shroud you have to make a manifold extension approximately 1-1/2&quot; tall. I know of three bugs running this set up and all three owners are pleased.

I don't have a clue how to rid the thing of the crabs though.
