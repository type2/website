&lt;&lt; Will a simple metal straight edge work, keeping it flat against the bottom 
one and measuring from straight edge to arm on top?&gt;&gt;

Hi Dave,
Yes, that will work.  Check out the Idiot's manual for the type1 procedure 
for this.

&gt;&gt;  Also can Shims be bought from folks like Ronnie?  I'm pretty sure I only 
has a total of 6 in there and the Bently refers to using 8 per Pin.&lt;&lt;

Good question!  Even if you have all the shims they might be worn thinner 
than they should be.
 
 &gt;&gt;While I'm at it; Is there a difference in the Link Pins?  Top veruses 
bottom?  &gt;&gt;

Same!   Eric&amp;Barb
