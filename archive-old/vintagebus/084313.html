Subject: Re: [VB] Carb Question

Have you checked to be sure the choke is opening? Is it adjusted right?

There should be a dot on the outer edge of the metal cap that covers the 
heating element. That should line up between a couple of ridges on the 
carb body. You can rotate the choke element to get more or less choke 
than that if you need it, but that's a good place to start..

&gt;Float seemed to move freely last time I had the top off the carb. Choke is brand new. As far as the jet size, your guess is as good as mine.
