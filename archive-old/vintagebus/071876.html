Subject: Hello

Hello, as you all probally know...I'm new.  Okay, I'am VERY willing to do 
work on a bus that does run.  I really don't know anything about fixing engines.  
But I did see a book at borders titled &quot;Fixing Up Your Old VW Bus&quot; so I think 
I'll be set.  Any of you have any tips for finding a bus? for around 
1000$(and i need it to be a daily driver, or possible to fix it up)  Thanks a lot!
