I think you can still buy the Barndoor wheel cylinders kits from NAPA,
here's a note I sent to the list way back when:

&quot;The front Barndoor cylinders are 22.2 mm in diameter, which is very close
to the 7/8&quot; rebuild kits available from NAPA stores as part# 513.&quot;

I have also heard that Super Beetle rebuild kits work but have no tried
that.

I know this is a long shot, but does anyone have a rebuild kit for a 25hp
engine?  I'm also looking for useable wheel cylinder rebuild kits for a '52
bus.  Can anyone out there help?

Thanks,
