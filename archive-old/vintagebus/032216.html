&gt;Hey, If your game is putting it back together as close as the way it came from
&gt;the factory so-be-it. Why would it matter? That's what vintage is all about.

I agree totally Ty. Sheesh, I've heard peoplpe on the list described as
&quot;vintage Nazis&quot;, now we're seeing a swing in the other direction to
&quot;anti-vintage&quot;. In my mind I have two types of buses. One is my daily
driver (66 EZ Camper). It's 12V, 1600 and a two tone paint job none of
which is &quot;stock&quot; but all of which add to the enjoyment of driving it
everyday. The other type of bus I have is my project bus. That's going to
be bone-factory stock. As much NOS as I can afford and find to put in it is
what it will have. It might not be on the road this year, but it will
eventually. I don't &quot;need&quot; anything on this bus, but I &quot;want&quot; it to be a
show winner type. It's not going to be a trailer-queen, but I even
understand those buses.

Do what you want with your hobby. Don't let other people tell you what you
haven't asked! Have fun!
