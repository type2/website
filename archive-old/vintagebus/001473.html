Tonight at 7:00 I pulled my engine out of the 67 bus and by 8:10 had it
comletely out.  The installation went a little bit slower lasting until 1:00
A.M.  I went for a test drive and could tell I had more power - nothing that
would snap your head back but just more steady power.  I was on my 3rd block
and the alternator settled down (glowing light went off) and then the bus
just slowly sputtered to a stop so I pushed it home 3 blocks by myself.
Efforts to restart it sounded like either jumped timing or lack of fuel so I
picked up my tools and closed shop.  It's now 2:00 a.m.

Anyone have any ideas for what I should check?  She started and ran great on
the garage floor but she won't even get me 3 blocks from home.

I gotta get to bed.  Later!
