To All...
...but especially to the person who asked if I would sign his copy of the
'Sermon' CD... and to whom I responded with some light-hearted remark.

Please accept my apology.  There's no excuse for boorishness but other than
bank tellers and traffic cops, no one has ever asked me for my autograph  -- I
thought you were joking.  Then two more people asked the same thing, including
a lady planning to surprise someone at Christmas -- whose surprise could not
possibly be greater than mine at receiving such a request.  

You've honored me by purchasing the CD.  It would be my pleasure to return the
favor by signing it.

I suggest you send me just the cover.  If you bought the CD for someone else,
please include a note telling how you'd like it signed.  A stamped, self-
addressed envelope would be the quickest way to get it back to you.

-Bob Hoover
