&gt;Well If i took a fische to lets say kinkos, would they have this $4000
&gt;scanner and be able to do it?  Does kinkos even have scanners?

I know they have regular scanners for paper and I think they have film
scanners as well.  Problem with Kinko's is that as soon as they see the
copyright on it they'll stop and ask you to get a release from the
copyright holder (VW) before they copy it.

Another place to try might be a camera shop that also does their own
film developing, or a specialty film developing place.  They may have
the film scanner as well, but they also might balk at the copyright.
