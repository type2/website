Subject: 6volt to 12volt wiper moter options

My '59 has been mostly converted to a 12volt system. One of the only things
left is the 6volt wiper motor. While weighing my options, I found this
page: http://www.acvwjyro_dot_com/acvwjy/6-to-12.htm. On there I found this
info:

&quot;When we got the Clubhouse (65 II), the WW motor was fried this way, and we
couldn't locate a replacement motor. But interestingly enough, the WW
frame and transmission assembly from a 77 bus matched the 65 frame exactly
in the distance from wiper shaft to wiper shaft, although the holes through
the body for the shafts had to be enlarged to 3/8&quot;. Unfortunately, the 77
WW motor was much too large to fit between the shelf and the dash. But the
good
news was that a Super Beetle motor, much smaller than the 77 bus motor,
bolted right up to the 77 bus transmission, and that's the way the
Clubhouse is
to this very day. &quot;

Anyone else tried this before? Sounds like a good aproach to take. Would
the wiper frame &amp; transmission be the same thing for all years of Baywindow
Buses?
