  Can a late 3:88 freeway flier trans be put in a b/d? Will the b/d axles

fit in a later trans?

Will the nose cone and hockey stick work or will the front mount have to be

modified to fit later trans? I would like to run a stock 1600 and later

trans but keep reduction boxes. Is this imposible? Is the b/d trans the only

1 that will work with reduction boxes? I would like to have a b/d that sits

stock but can run freeway speeds on long trips.  Shoot me if you want, but

it will be another b/d on the road.

the center section in a bd bolts in the same as any split case tranny.
Meaning the nose cone is differntthan the tunnel typr and no it does not
interchange.   You can get an adaptor plate - many originally split case buses
have had this done.  But you should keep the barndoor axles or it will be
really funky in the back also no shocks.   Yes the axles bolt on the same.  Be
aware of early (early 59 and back)/late fulcrum plates- do not mix and match
(refer to my tranny woes in archives from Nov for more info)
