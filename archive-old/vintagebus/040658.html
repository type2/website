All,
	 Sadly I had to sell the 66 to pay a doctor. Thanks to all for the inputs
various and advice personal, deeply appreciated. I am already off list but
as I leave, on my way to work there is an accident damaged kombi, (rear end
shunt) On the side with spraycan is written &quot;ORIKOMBI&quot;
I nearly drove off the road.
	Thanx again,
	Barrry Wright
