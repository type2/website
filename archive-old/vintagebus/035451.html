Did you know that 25hp/36hp thermostat rods are differnt than the later ones?

 (This being the bit that goes vertical between the thermostat and the
linakage above- it goes on the right side between the cylinders) 

And that no matter how you try the early one will not work on your 1600.

You can try  a lot.

You can turn it all kinds of different ways, take the fan housing on and off
and on and off, shine lights under neath, and get on the floor and look, etc 

I called my boyfriend, who had just put one on his bug (1600 sp doghouse) and
he said it was really easy.   I said some thing rude.   I didn't remember
putting it together was so tricky.

Then I looked in my books, and saw the early and later rods were differnt, and
the one I was using looked- early, not later.    Duh.  Well, not I know.

Funny how many bits there are to a bus.   Lets all guess, and the closest
person wins a 25hp/36hp thermostat rod.   whoo   ya.   for some reason I am
less that excited.  Okay next prize is a disassembled bus with some missing
bits,  miscellaneous bits from other vws/ther cars thrown in, some bits broken
/rusty and a time limit for assemblage.  Oh, I already have that.  never mind.
