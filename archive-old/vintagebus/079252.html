Subject: Re: [VB] Early type 1 alternator bearing failure and a Friday
  Funny

  The biggest cause of failures in the new AL82N Bosch alternators that I have come across

1. over tightened belt
2. fan hub grooved, causing the fan to sit a couple 1000's off ceneter causing it to be out of balance
3. fan cenetering hole a little wollowed out, causing off center out of balance
4. just a way out of balance fan
5. not enough shims under fan nut, causing nut to bottom out on Alt shaft before fully tight
6. alt strap not tight enough, causes alt to bounch around a little
7. alt has sat on shelf for a long time or not used, causing grease in bearing to harden, thus premature bearing failure
8. 1 out of 1000 or more may have a bad bearing (unlikely), I have only seen this in 1 alt in 10 years of selling them
9. fan shroud bolts/screws to cylinder tin loose, causes whole fan assembly to bounce around, not a likely cause of 
bearing filure though
10. I have to sort through many aftermarket fans before I find a good one. When I install a new fan I only use Genuine 
VW de Mexico now. Quality seems much better then Brazilian aftermarket

&gt;Has anyone noticed rapid failure of the front bearing of Brasilian Bosch
&gt;type 1 alternators?  I had one go bad and my girls' music instructor had
&gt;the same thing happen recently.  Both alternators were brand new with only
&gt;a few hundred miles on them.  Symptoms are similar to a loose or cracked
&gt;fan.  If you reach around and move the fan up and down you can see the
&gt;pulley tilt slightly.
