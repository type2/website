Hey, I was wondering if anyone knew anything about putting a 36hp nut on a
1600 single port and trying to crankstart it? would there be too much
torque? would it snap back and break your arm? :) I am goin to put a 1600
single port in my 57 and would still like to retain a somewhat stock look of
the crankstart and etc. lemme know if anyone has seen this done or knows
anything about it. thanx
