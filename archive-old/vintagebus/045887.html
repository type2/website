re the MC activating rod:

if you are under the bus you should be able to pull the pedal down and see 
the rod going into the MC?   It should move, as John wrote, about 1mm.    
when is doesn't, you adjust the rod, not the stop, as John suggested.   There 
is a lock nut on it, usually rusty, but with a bit of patience, or a luckily  
unrusty bus, not compicated.   you put  a vise grip on the rod and a wrench 
on the nut , loosen the nut and adjust the rod.  when the space is 1mm, 
tighten down the lock nut (did you remeber to grease the threads?)

 Jim,
I hope you had a good memorial day weekend, I thought I'd write and let
you know that I have found the source of my recurring brake problem. The
problem if you remember is that when the bus gets hot, pedal travel goes
to zero and the brakes become ineffective.
I've been treating this as air in the lines, but a little studying in
the Bentley manual has provided the answer, apparently the stop on the
pedal connection (a piece of steel on the frame which provides a bumper
at the junction of the brake pedal lever and the clevis-pushrod for the
master cylinder), is mis-adjusted. I don't have the manual so I'm not
quoting verbatim, however, when the pushrod for the master cylinder is
replaced, it must be exactly the same length as the original, which is
set at the factory. If this rod is too long, the pushrod doesn't retract
far enough to allow fluid to escape into the secondary reservoir
contained  in the master cylinder. This reservoir is provided to allow
for fluid expansion due to heat. If the reservoir entrance is blocked by
a mis-adjusted pushrod, the fluid expands in the system, causing the
pedal to stiffen and the brake lights to remain on. (Exactly what is
happening).
Bentley says to bend the pedal bumper to allow for approx 1 mm of pedal
travel at the top of the pedal (.04&quot;) this is enough to allow the
pushrod to retract past the reservoir entrance allowing the
heat-expanded fluid to escape thus maintaining the integrity of the
hydraulic design.
Make sense??
