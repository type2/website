&gt; hey i was lucky yesterday i found a guy in my town that do powdercoating !!  
&gt; i just need to bring my sanblasted part and it will be done.

Hi Mike,
Great!

&gt; So bby your advice, after the sandblast i should zinc prime it before (this 
&gt; is the yellow stuff no ?)

No, there is a powdercoat zinc primer for marine purposes that he should 
apply before the black 80% gloss powdercoat layer.

&gt; Now about the  color, what is 80% gloss semi-gloss black powdercoat ???  i
&gt; just ask him about putting this ??  maybe i could buy the powder somewhere 
&gt; and bring it to him, my first thought was to use a satin black !!

Well 80% gloss is a semi-gloss that matches the original VW factory 
semi-gloss black of the engine tin.

&gt; tks for your advice
&gt; mike

You are welcome!
Eric&amp;Barb
