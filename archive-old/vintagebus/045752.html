&lt;&lt; I think the code may have something to do with an extra switch on the 
dash. to the right of the headlight switch there is another switch that looks 
factory. After switching it on I heard a dull buzzing sound from under the 
dash, I went out and looked and saw both front directionals were on but not 
flashing (signals dont work). 
 I guess this is some kind of emergency flasher system? I didnt think a 62 
would have something like that. Does anyone else have a setup like this? &gt;&gt;
Hi Alan,
Our 14DEC59 built 60 model walkthru panel does not have this E-flashers 
system.  While our 26FEB62 built 62 Flip-seat Westie does and looks to be a 
factory install due to paint in the hole the flasher switch goes through the 
dash.  We found most of a SP-88A 6 volt kit for installing an E-flasher 
system in earlier buses at last Vintage weekend.  Have not been able to 
narrow down when this system was installed standard from the factory yet.  
How about it listies?  Who has the earliest E-flasher system that looks 
factory installed?    Eric&amp;Barb
