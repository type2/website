Subject: Oil Cooler Upgrades II

Thanks for all the comments and concern.  I currently do not have a
overtemp problem, but as an engineer I tend to overkill things, it's in
my blood.  More oil, lots of cooling, but the key is I can get most of
the parts for not too much. Our '67 Kombi is my first nonFord and I'm
used to 351W/351C small blocks and a 460 in vans. We use our bus for
around town driving which a 460 is decidely not good for and will sit at
lights and in traffic a lot. Yes - hi temp &amp; hi pressure hose is a must,
a return line to the case must be machined (rebuild time) and probably a
temp bypass for the second cooler.  A comment back to Paul.  Is the &quot;tin
on top of the cylinders&quot; the cylinder shrouds. I am relatively new to
VWs, but from the Bugpack Quick Reference Guide the dual ports heads
were first used in '71. I think the doghouse shroud also started in '71.
Sooo, there was not a doghouse shroud used on a single port engine,
which would mean a different tin for the doghouse setup would not be
available for a single port head. But, when I get the engine rebuilt
adding dual port heads will I need to watch for the correct dual port
cylinder shroud?
Another question - what kind of foam is used around a doghouse cooler?
It looks like open cell foam and hi temp, for sure, but where can you
get it?
Thanks again for all the comments.
Roger &amp; Trudi
