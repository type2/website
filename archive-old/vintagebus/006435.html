&gt;Okay. . . maybe we shouldn't concider our busses as investments. Just
&gt;the same, I read in VolksWorld magazine that Jerry Seindeld bought a bus
&gt;&gt;from some dooooood. And the dooooooood didnt wanna sell, but Mr.
&gt;Seinfeld was &quot;very persuasive&quot;. Seems to me it's a hobby that may have a
&gt;financial aside.
&gt;
&gt;Anyways. . . I also have heard that Julia Roberts has a splitty. Can
&gt;anyone tell us of other celebrity busnuts??
&gt;
&gt;Better yet, if you know of a celebrity such as Jerry with fistfulls of
&gt;persuasion, send em my way :) !!!!
