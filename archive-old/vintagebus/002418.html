Ye list,
I have just farewelled an old friend who has a 65 bus. A little bit of
camping gear in the back, nothing too flash, but he has completely removed
the divider behind the seats. Very convenient walkthrough between bucket
seats. Q. I this safe? I always reckoned that that bit was essential to stop
the whole bus flexing and twisting while in action. He says he cant feel any
difference.
    Anybody know?
