If you guys want to see some really nice shots of BBB that Rob took and
Terry seamed together, go to http://204.26.80.78:8084/bbbv/bridge.html

It gives you an AWESOME online perspective of the event and makes you feel
like you are right there.  Due to movements of the crowd and so forth, there
are slight anomolies in the shots but the overall effect is awesome.  I took
a panoramic shot of the whole event from a point just south of where it was
being held but as of now, it hasn't been posted.  I need to send Terry the
photos in numerical order.  I zoomed in and took about 20 photos.  That will
make one helluva a huge photo but if Terry can seam them, I may have to get
a big professional printout of it and hang it up on the wall.
