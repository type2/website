Subject: RE: [VB] Re: The cost of AR

One item I learned right off the bat; CHASE ALL THREADS!!!!!!!!!!!

Chroming adds a reasonable amount of stuff to the part... mostly in the
first copper layer.  The second layer, nickel, is the layer that gives the
hardness and it too is reasonably think.  The chrome is really only a very
thin layer.  The chemistry of the whole plating process is quite
interesting...

Matt asked:
Serious question - when you have a bolt or screw chromed, do they just
do the head or do they try to do the whole thing?  How about nuts?  Does
the chrome plating on the threads change the diameter enough to make them
difficult to install, or is there enough tolerance that the chrome doesn't
bother it?  Just curious about this.
