Subject: Part Needed- Ohio- Buy or trade for Bus Parts

Hey Y'all,
To the bus lists: I'm sorry, this content may be
marginal, its a BUG part BUT I have BUS parts to
trade, so I think I'm OK ;^)
ANyway, I need a decent front axle beam for a 73
standard bug (pretty sure any year 67 &amp; up will do).
The shock tower on mine is rusted away! It can be a
bare beam or drum to drum with other stuff on it,
doesn't matter. Just needs to be affordable and close
enough for me to pick up ( I am just north of
Cincinnati Ohio and I don't mind driving  a ways..)
If shipping doesn't cost more than $50, then that is
also an option. 
I have a TON of late Baywindow bus parts I can trade
(I actually have a 78 parts bus, minus engine and
tranny, so if you need it, I probably have it.)
So let me know if you got one, and what you need for
it.
Thanks!

Peace, John Baker
