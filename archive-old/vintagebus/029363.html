Subject: dealership tools

Hello,
When VW dealerships were first established (the early ones anyways) it
is my understanding that VW gave them blueprints or drawings of all the
tools they would need.  The new dealership then took these down to their
favorite tool maker, and had them made up.  I can get my hands on some
of these drawings/blueprints (I forget what they're actually
called...the name is on the tip of my tounge) and would like to have
some of these tools made up.  Would this be possible?  Would it be
impossible to find someone to make these...or be outrageousely
expensive?  I suppose I could make them myself...
Has anyone ever done this before?  This might be a violation of patent
laws?

Isaiah
