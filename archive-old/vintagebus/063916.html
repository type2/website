Subject: Puyallup/Octo shows... bummer

Hi All,

Looks like i'll be shut out of both the puyallup show tomorrow and the octo
show next weekend... too much going on here in eastern oregon.  but, while
I'm working on the double cab, i thought i would put an APB out to anyone
that is going to any of these shows...  here's a list to print out for me
(ok, wishful thinking but it will make me feel better about missing both
shows)

- 1 piece of original SIGLA front windshield glass
- any pieces of heater tube fabric
- 36 hp distributor clamp
- perfect 'B6' engine case
- pepco supercharger (ok, like you'll be willing to plunk $$$ down for me on
something like this..)
- Walker wheels  (ditto)
- speedwell sprint carb parts or speedwell shocks (hey, stop asking for the
impossible)
- 4-59 date code Fictel and Sachs bus shocks
- 70 date code Koni bus shocks with the 211 part number on them. (should
have a 'winged' logo also stamped into the body)
- body trim and outside door mirror for a 66 bug (have a heart, it's for my
daughter)
- Red tip to a hirschmann antenna... JUST THE RED TIP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
- Pedal pan bolts


... i'll stop there :-)



TIA


David
