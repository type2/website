Subject: Help!, with my 67 motor....

Hi list,

     This is in regards to my single port 1500 motor that I have in my 67 
beetle (yes, I sent this to the bus list, just to get some extra insight).  
Now, I am going to type a few questions in a few different e-mails to 
address the (3) or so questions I have, and the subjects should explain a 
good bit of whats in the e-mails, and everyone can reply accordingly.  I 
have been away from the list for a while, so I am going to filter through a 
few of the e-mails, that I have left, to see if they address any of the 
questions, then I will type and send them.

Bare with me, I want to get my questions across as clearly as possible.
oh, and the problems that I will build on are related to:

Oil cooling,
Oil pressure,
&quot;extra&quot; engine cooling (head temp, tachs, etc)
and a predicament I'm in with there being metal bits in my oil.....

thanks way in advance!
Matt in Pa
