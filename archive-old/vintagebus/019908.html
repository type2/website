Subject: red barn

hey, jp made it to monterey from arizona just fine.  he arrived last night tired and hungry.  lots of driving to be sure!  anyway, jp and i headed back from red barn to get our coats.  it's raining something fierce right now.  sv2 troops are in hotels near by.  wimps!  ronnie, vwhoward, jp, jon furst, everywhere ed and a couple other folks are toughing it out.  for late arrivers tonight, the gate will be closed but not locked, just pull up.  breakfast will be served in the morning by red barn.  so don't stop to eat on the way, eat when you arrive or when you roll out of your campers in the morning showing those sv2 babies what they be!
