Rather than adjust my bus, I'll adjust my bday, so the '63 DC is just right! 
Besides, I'd be competing with Ronnie for a '53 YOBB. 

I'm heading to Oahu next week to see my son graduate and see him off to Portland to make chip thingys for Intel. The rest of the tasks are visits to brewpubs and tourist traps. Any bus owners around? Need any parts hauled over?
