Subject: RE: [VB] RE: Calif. &amp; Ariz. Emissions Laws - What's the latest?

If you are running a -STOCK- VW Motor--upright--and 1967 and newer-- You
should be able to get through emissions in AridZona, without too much
trouble--or with a &quot;Little&quot; carb adjustment----Bessie my 1967 made it
through--

jesses writ:

&gt;-- AND you have Classic Car insurance -- You will NOT have to
&gt;go through Emissions-


basically, if you have a DAILY DRIVER, this means you are screwed, afaict...
i mean, i have all my 70's smog stuff in a box, but it doesn't work.
and most classic insurance prohibits non-parade use.
ronnie, are you having trouble passing your cars - or do you &gt;know&lt; someone
;)
