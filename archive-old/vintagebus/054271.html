to come in +2, +1, 0, -1, and -2 formats.  I am thinking that 0 is the best 
choice  or would something more aggressive be better like +2? &gt;&gt;

Hi Adrian,
That is not the offset, but the diameter size of the cam gear to allow for 
more or less distance from the centers of the crankshaft and cam bores in the 
engine case.  Try installing a +3 cam in a -3 cam engine case and you will 
have the cam gear shear off at the rivets about 30 miles down range (Much 
like a type 3 owner we know of!) !  Eric&amp;Barb
