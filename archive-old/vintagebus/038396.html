I hope this doesn't turn out to be another disappointment, but I think we
are 90% worked out on a '63 Crew in Sacramento area.

If this works out, crossing fingers, I will actually be driving SOUTH to
Santa Barbara from Sacramento to pick up my girlfriend, then turning around
and heading back north to Seattle.  Yep, I'm crazy!  Her companionship for
the ride home should be worth this rather large detour South... don't ask.

1) Tranny has 4th pop out.  Hopefully I can rig it in for long Interstate
drive.  In spirit of good Karma, I'm already checking on getting a rebuild
(2 weeks lead time). Todd Hill tells me he is short cores on '63 and down
tranny.  I presume I want to stay with the original style (&quot;small nut&quot;?).
Is this sensible?  I will be running 1600DP, so not stock engine... and I
plan on having Todd go with the better R&amp;P.   Anyone have a &quot;small nut&quot;
tranny that they would sell me between Santa Barbara and Seattle?
Sacramento would be ideal, in case it turns out that 4th is so bad that I
need to pop it in.  I know that this isn't likely, but I can dream, right
&lt;grin&gt;.

2) Given my long drive home, I figured it would be a GOOD investment to go
ahead and purchase new rear tires, as large as I can fit.  Want to get the
top speed I can with the stock tranny and redux gears for the long ride.
I've studied the archives, but would appreciate some assistance. What is the
largest tire I can get that will not rub a stock '63 crew with two
passengers, limited gear, and possibly an extra tranny (as cargo).  This msg
http://www.i405_dot_com/vwarchive/sm.asp?ID=78001&amp;ml=5 suggests that I can
expect 47MPH in 4th _at_ 3000 RPM.  It also hints at 29&quot; tires, gaining about 6
MPH, but doesn't talk about how well they fit.

3) related to #2, anyone have an extra set (2) of wheels I could purchase in
Sacramento area?  That way I could get new tires on them for the rear and
not have to remove the existing ones.  Just checking my options...

Planning a pretty slow trip with 50MPH average.  However, I would like to
see if I can gather phone numbers and locations in case I run into trouble
and need help locating assistance.  How bad 4th pop-out in the Tranny is the
big wildcard...

Anyone have Thom's numbers to e-mail me?  He offered via e-mail to check out
the crew first hand, but I don't have a phone number for him.

You guys have been great!

It means that if you are looking for a complete axle nut
to axle nut 1963 and earlier Type 2 transaxle I do not
have any of those cores and would have to use yours.
My regular local supplier does not have any at this time
either.  All I have is the later post-'64 style right now.
