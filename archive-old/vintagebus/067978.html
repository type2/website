Subject: Re: [VB] Clutch Part numbers

the right part but not the part you expected. I base this on eight years
as a counter person.

Ted :
I respect your cautions on this acquisition.
Some parts are just hard to get right because they are not &quot;most popular&quot;
and can't be ordered from Vendors Web Sites. It takes at least a one on
one telephone conversation to get the right parts. Historically it takes
me 30 minutes on line to order this type parts order.
