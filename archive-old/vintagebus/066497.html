Subject: re:rear brake procedure

was writ:
&quot;A very definite boundary between rubbing and not rubbing.  I tightened the
adjusters until it rubbed, then backed off until it turned freely, then two
additional clicks loose (and I made sure that I was going in the right
direction this time!)&quot;

I thought the proper way to adjust the brakes you want the slightest rubbing
to be occuring-the idea being that a tiny bit of the brake shoes will wear
off with a little driving around, and that way your brakes are nice and
tight. The way you described doing it-sounds like your brakes would be too
loose.
