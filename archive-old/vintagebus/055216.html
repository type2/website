&lt;&lt; Good point, reminds me of the folks that have the the slow CPUs with

However squirrels are mighty strong for their size, and most especially 
they are fast climbers--it just isn't right, it don't fit, Joe!

I suggest for a rating standard the pulling power of some sort of 
gastropod, probably something like a slug, as they are weak and 
horizontally opposed, and behind them they leave a shiny slick.
