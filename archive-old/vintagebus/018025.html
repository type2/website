Subject: albuquerque, nm to monterey, ca (trip report)

it's midnight but don't ask me what day.  my truck and i returned home about half an hour ago.  i left albuquerque yesterday morning about 7 and arrived just as the sun was going down in lake havasu city.  on the way my truck and i endured bitter cold, pouring rain (my truck leaks a lot!) and winds that reduced our travel from 55/60mph to 45.  there was also a headlight switch weirdness that brought on the generator light and acted as a 35mph speed governor any time i tried to flash the big rigs it was okay to get over.

in lake havasu city, i met vwhoward, his wife and their two doggies.  i was given a tour of vwhoward's toy collection, the luxurious trailer they go &quot;camping&quot; in and some of the contents of the garage.  i ate a wonderful home-cooked meal and slept on a bed for the first time in more than a week!  in the morning i went to ronnie's shop and looked at his two barndoors... that is to say i looked at his panel and parts of the deluxe.  his panel is really very nice - solid and complete.  it's got what i think are neat rust streaks running down various areas of its body.  the deluxe is a logo bus but very far gone.  parts from it are going to save 10 barndoors in the u.s. and canada!  ronnie, his wife and i shot the breeze for awhile and then i hit the road at about 11:30.  ronnie said that if i had trouble within 150 miles to give him a call.

at the second gas stop about 140 miles out of lake havasu the truck didn't start... no click, just the speedo lights.  i thought about calling but it seemed a minor enough thing especially considering i'd had the same problem on the way to albuquerque.  i asked a guy to push my truck and it popped started easily enough.  while driving along the road i thought about the possible things it might be.  hours and miles later i'm hoping that it's a loose wire.  the bumpy roads could have loosened more than just the heater connections and the wooden bows of the tilt setup.

the only casualty to the trip was the tailgate bow.  it appears as if it's not strong enough to withstand the force of the wake a big rig makes when traveling the opposite way down a one lane highway.  fortunately it appears as if it can be bent back into shape and in future i'll only put up the canvas if i know it will be raining.

what i think i've discovered from this adventure is a self-confidence i didn't realize that i had.  i traveled some 4000 miles by myself in a truck more than 40 years old and just a year on the road with me.  i traveled highways i've never been on.  i experienced difficulties but never once worried that i might be stranded or would have to abandon my truck.  i also discovered that i have a great deal of blind faith that things will work out.  because of my experiences over the last few years i believe that my volkswagens will either breakdown at home or at the shop.  i agree that it's pretty silly but i have yet to be shown otherwise.  what made this trip so fabulous was that my truck and i did it with only minor difficulties.  at least equal if not greater contributor to the trip was all the great folks i met both volkswagen enthusiast and otherwise.

now i'm off to bed to dream of loose starter wires, a dove blue dash illuminated by speedo lights and 36 horse motors as cargo in a truck's bed.  tomorrow i'm gonna give juan a big hug and thank him for building me such a great engine.

In a new car, you're just going somewhere;                                
in a Volkswagen you ARE somewhere. -Stormy Henderson's Dad
