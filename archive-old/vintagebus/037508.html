Subject: Re:  [VB] 7seater vs walkthough?
To: SoloHobbit_at_aol_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

model #  241 aand 244 are deluxes, LHD and RHD respectively

model #251 is deluxe 7 seater aka walkthrough.

if a 251 has m code 81 that is merely repetitive and redundant.  &quot; this 
7-seater is a walkthrough&quot;

if a 24 model has M-81 they could have called it a 25 model but didn't.    
Dont worry about it.

didn't one bus in the neato registry have 3 or so codes fmeaning walkthrough 
on it?
