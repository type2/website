hey guys/gals
if anyone has a spare wiring harness just lying around that they're not
using...I could really use it.  I need one that will fit a 63 kombi.  It
would be great if it was new...but if it is in good used condition...I
could handle that...
I would like to trade something for it...I believe I have some old bus
tail lights..the little round glass ones..and the chrome rings to go
with it...

let me know..I have some other things too...just name what you would
like and I'll see if I have it.

thanks!
