So it is cold here in Central Canada like most of you just would not

understand.  My door looks were not working - frozen I guess, so I took

apart the drivers door and somehow I just can't remember how that silly

spring goes in.  I got it back together and it works - but something is

wrong.  The handle itself doesn't go in close to the body like it does on

the passenger side - it sort of sticks out at a wierd angle.  I can push it

in and it sits properly when I do that but I have to push it in for it to

stay parellel with the body and not sticking out it some angle.  It's a

problem because I'm sure that I will hook my self on it someday.  I think

it's just the spring that is in wrong - but I fooled with it for an hour and

I could only get it to go in one way ...... hmmmmm

-  --  -
the springs like on your 60 unde rthe door panel go with the wide end against 
the door and the smaller end at the panel-  so it will push where the handle 
is on the other sdide of the panel than the spring.    did you do it that 
way?      Then again, did you screw the screws down for the part of the door 
mechanism the handle goes on?  that part could be loose- but it would 
probably affect the opening function of the interior handle.     something 
seems funky
