&gt;Is seven years considered a decent amount of time for these things to
&gt;last?

In working on random American cars built from the late 70s to the mid 90s,
it seems like the master cylinder is about a 100k mile part, give or take.
These cars were mostly daily drivers.

If you've been putting 12-15k miles a year on your Bus, then 7 years is
probably reasonable.  I am not as sure about this, but: I think that
sitting and not being driven much may also be hard on the rubber parts
in the master cylinder.  So, if your Bus sat a lot, 7 years might still
be reasonable.

&gt;There seems to be two types of these MC on the market one costs less
&gt;than $20 and one costs close to $100.

One is Brazilian, the other is German.  Or at least that's the way it
was when I did the dual-circuit conversion a couple of years ago.

&gt;Is the quality that different, I know it is my brakes so I want to get
&gt;what makes sense, but my last replacement only lasted 7 years(I imagine
&gt;I was replacing the original one which was way older than that).

I went for the $100 German part; I haven't installed or used a $20
Brazilian so I can't really comment.  I will observe that if either one
lasts 7 years, the expensive one costs you $14.29 a year and the cheap
one costs you $2.86 a year - an $11.43 difference.  I would submit that
$11.43 is lost in the noise of what it takes per year to keep an old VW
on the road...

&gt;Will all this fit under the splash pan? Will using a rabbit reservois
&gt;still fit in the bus without any alterations?

I did it in my '64 and it all fits under the pan.  The Rabbit reservoir
fits, and the filler cap even lines up with the hole in the floor of the
cab.

The kit is essentially a big aluminum donut, used as a spacer.  The one
I got was machined to fit the nose of the Brazilian master cylinder
(verified at the parts store); my German part was just a little too big
for it.  A few minutes with a Dremel tool took care of it.
