Subject: Rust Prevention Question

So I just pulled the front bumper of my 60 apart.  With the rear my plan is 
to clean the tubes out really well and pour in some por-15 - maybe thin it 
out a bit and rinse it around a few times - no problem (I hope).  The front 
tube is different tho.  It is quite a bit bigger. I'm wondering if the 
por-15 idea is best or maybe ... something else - like maybe phosphoric 
acid.  The problem with these tubes is that rust comes out of the ends and 
runs down the blades and looks ... sh*tty.

TIA
