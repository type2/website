Subject: Re: [VB] How do you remove oil filler piece?

I have removed several of these nuts
easily with the improvised tool ( $ free )
every one had a thin paper gasket.
I have discovered that a SP intake
copper ring gasket is the same ID
and will crush nicely for the same
result.

&gt; I asked Ronnie of Old Volks why my oil filler head might be loose, and
&gt; whether there should be some sort of gasket in there. He sent along a
metal
&gt; gasket ring in my order, which I'm guessing goes right under the rim of
the
&gt; filler nut (once I get it off...). I'll look into the EMPI tool and try
&gt; again.
