Subject: Tell me about this disty...
Mime-Version: 1.0

I've got a distributor I need help identifying.

It's got the VW logo on it. Also has 050 in an oval. Other numbers are:

J FUD 4 &lt;-----
0 231 168 015
043 905 205 L

It's got a vacume canister on it as well.

I wanted to use this because it looks like it'll use common 009 cap, rotor, 
points, ect. I always had trouble finding points and stuff for the disty I 
just pulled out of my engine.

This disty would be going into a stock 1600 DP engine that's in my '59 Kombi.

Thanks.
