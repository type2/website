Subject: Re: Bus nose skin

I'm parting out the rolled 67 kombi and it has a fairly good front
skin. It has small bubble rust on the lip behind the front bumper and
dents around the area where bumper brkts. slide through nose. This is
a 67/66? front nose with big radio area, dash uncut. If someone needs
it I will somehow get it to Jerome Jam 8 and sell for fair price. $50.00
+ or - . This should cover reduced gas mileage to Jerome.
