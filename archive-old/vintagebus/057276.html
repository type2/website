Subject: Re: [VB] gettin' of the grease/mud

If you have the time, simply soak them in hot water and soap.

Otherwise, use solvents made for degreasing

You don't need high temp paint, but if you go to bare metal you really
need to degrease well, prime, and paint to get the paint to stick.  Try to
preserve the original paint if you can!

&gt; I have some valve covers and misc. tin with the 40 years of road gunk/oil/dirt and whatever else. They are straight and from the small areas I have cleaned off the paint is still intact. What is the best way to clean off the gunk without screwing up the paint....   I'm not looking for a miracle/mystery product just a way to do it. What kind of degreaser? What method?
&gt;
&gt; If there is no reasonable way and I go sandblast them, do I need to use high temp paint? I've never painted valve covers before... do they get hotter the engine tin? I know I should powder coat them but....
