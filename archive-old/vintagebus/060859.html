Subject: RE: [VB] Wood slats on every row???

ow about UHMW?It is used in industrial applications for bushings and drive chain guides.It also is FDA approved so you can feel good setting your beer or favorite beverage on it.In the food industry our prep tabletops were made from it.It also makes excellant slider pucks for your motorcycle leathers,why buy cheap ones that wear easily when you can get a sheet of UHMW and sticky back velcro for the same price.We made some nice case guards from it as well.

From a web site: 

UHMW possesses a unique combination of physical and mechanical properties which enable it to perform well under the most rigorous conditions of wear and environment. It has the highest known impact strength of any thermoplastic presently made, plus high resistance to abrasion against a wide variety of metals. These properties make UHMW an exceptional material for industrial impact, wear and sliding operations. UHMW is FDA compliant and USDA approved for direct contact in food processing applications.

I was wondering if anyone has considered synthetic slats 
as in the new decking material made from recylcled 
plastic? I just looked at a Google search for recycled 
decking and found a bunch of sources. There's a few 
choices of color and uses the same tools and fasteners 
as wood. Guess I could get dimensions and have some 
milled. Anybody interested in a set?
