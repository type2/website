&gt; I posted to the Loaf list and didn't get a response... here is
hoping that
&gt; the vintagebus list is willing to provide some technical details.
&gt; 
&gt; I have a new Brazil AS41 case but it has no provision for a thermostat
&gt; bracket.  I want to drill / tap / whatever you call it so I can put
a stud
&gt; in.
&gt; 
&gt; I have never drilled a new hole in metal before, let alone a metric
hole.
&gt; I'd appreciate any help on telling me what tools I need to purchase
and how
&gt; to go about doing this.  Details, details, details.
&gt; 
&gt; I have another case around that does have the stud, so I can use
that as a
&gt; point of reference on knowing WHERE to drill the hole.

OK, you need:

hammer
centerpunch
1/16&quot; (or so) center drill
Tap of correct size and pitch for thread.
Bottoming tap of same size and pitch
Tap handle
Tap drill of size specified by tap.
1/2&quot; masking tape
electric drill motor

Measure and mark the location of the new hole on the case.

Use hammer and centerpunch to make a dimple exactly on the marked
location.

Measure again to make sure that the dimple is exactly where you want
it. The rule here is &quot;measure twice, drill once&quot;

Measure the depth of the hole on the existing case.

Measure the same distance from the end of the center drill and put
tape on it so that the tape will just touch when the drill is the
correct depth.

Now, use the center drill to drill a hole straight into the case from
the centerpunch mark.  Back out now and then to clear chips.  Stop
when the tape just touches the case.

Repeat the previous two steps with the tap drill.  Make sure that the
drill is held perpendicular to the case!  The accuracy of this hole
determines the accuracy of the finished hole.

Put the tap in the tap handle and carefully screw it into the hole. 
Screw it in 3/4 turn, back it out a half-turn, in 3/4, out 1/2 and so
on until the tap bottoms out in the hole.  The reason that you have to
back up all the time is to clear chips from the hole.  Every couple of
turns you should take the tap out all the way and flush the hole out. 
WD-40 seems to work well for the flushing and to lubricate the tap.

Now, if you want to get fancy, go buy a _bottoming_ tap in the same
size.  This tap doesn't have the taper at the end that the other tap
does, so you can tap complete threads all the way to the bottom of the
hole.  You can't start with this tap, since it must have an existing
thread to screw into.

That's it!  When you're done you might offer the drill and tap kit to
the list to recoup your costs or perhaps just to boost your karma!  :)
