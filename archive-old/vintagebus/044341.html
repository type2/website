Subject: Need some quick help....

I got my inner wheel bearing off. It wasn't bad. I just was going 
REALLY easy with it yesterday for fear of damaging it. I gently put a 
puller on it today and it came right off.

Problem now is I got excited and didn't pay enough attention to how 
the seal and spacer go. My seal has a metal side and a felt side. 
Which goes toward the backing plate? And the spacer has a flat side 
and a &quot;cupped&quot; side. Which way goes toward the backing plate?

This is for a '59 Kombi. Thanks.
