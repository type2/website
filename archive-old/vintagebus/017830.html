Subject: Engine Swap
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I need to temporarily swap engines between my bug and
bus (won't bother to explain why).  I will be taking
a 12v DP 1600 from the bus and putting it into a 1966
6v bug. I would like the bug to remain 6v.  Other than
the obvious (swapping generator, regulator, coil et
al.) what are the issues I might encounter?  Will the
12v flywheel go in the 6v bell housing?  Will the
starter line up and work?  I have heard both good and
bad opinions and don't want to start until I have a
definite answer.

As always, you wisdom is appreciated.
