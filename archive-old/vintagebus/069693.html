&gt; The Dual Port doghouse thermostat rod runs differently through the heads

Hi MUD,
;-)  The only parts for DH flaps differant from non-DH shroud is the linkage 
between the flaps.  Make sure you are threading the rod through the correct 
hole (Into the outer, is how we remember.) in the 1&amp;2 head and that the 
curved arm the upper rod attaches through is not bent too close to the flaps. 
 There should be about a popcicle stick width of space there!
