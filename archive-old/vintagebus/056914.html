Subject: Re: [VB] fuel pump for H-case

 Hello-

Your motor looks like it could be a a '65, well the
tin at least. I don't have a list of cases and the
codes for them.I think a '67 pre-heater set up is
different running behind the shroud, instead of the
front? I could be wrong. Fuel pump looks like a late
model one. You could also be missing the governor but
i'm not sure. That little pre-heater hose clamp that
is on the tin i could be wrong for a '67 and I could
even find it in my heart to help you get rid of it!
let me know.

&gt; Hi All,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm looking to replace the fuel pump on the 67
&gt; tipper... it's wrong and I
&gt; want to right it.  I'm having a *discussion* with my
&gt; insurance people right
&gt; now so I have a bit of time to fix a few odds and
&gt; ends.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, it's supposed to have a H-case in it.  It
&gt; appears the fuel pump
&gt; should have a threaded inlet and a slip on outlet. 
&gt; What part should I be
&gt; looking for.  Are there any other parts I should be
&gt; looking for.... i.e.
&gt; someone already asked me if this thing should have a
&gt; fuel regulator...
&gt; follow the link for a picture of the engine as it is
&gt; now.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; In the long run, what's the best reference to ensure
&gt; engine correctness? ...
&gt; not trying to be AR or anything...
&gt;
