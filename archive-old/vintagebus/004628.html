&gt;Repeated requests for a simple set screw went unanswered after flagging
down
&gt;several passer-by vehicles. Good ole Everett Barnes finally gave me a ride
&gt;into camp only to find that two rednecked FORD and CHEVY fans were already
&gt;in the process of towing the rat '63 of mine into camp. I suspect just to
&gt;spite me. I mean, REALLY! A two second set screw replacement woulda done
the
&gt;trick. I *allow* these guys to give me a rough time once in awhile seeing
as
&gt;they are ballsy enough to drive American technology to the baddest VW event
&gt;of the year. Nice choice. ;-)

Gawd, that was delicious. I think I'll smoke now.
Yes, it's true. There was a brief yet bloody battle between the redneck F*rd
and the Chevy powered VW, but the Ford won out due to it making a better
story. Besides, I didn't think the limo could make a U-turn up there in them
thar' hills. When we arrived at Ugly Bustacuss, we realized that Mr.
VanBondo had &quot;gone missing&quot; and was, in all probability trying to deprive us
of our fun by seeking the missing shift coupler bolt and repairing it. We
hooked up the tow bar and got that sucker rolling downhill tootsweet. Passed
him right in downtown Jerome. He rode back in the bus while the lovely Mrs.
VanB enjoyed the creature comforts of a waterpumper. Heh, heh. Jolly good
sport. We delivered him to the aforementioned campsite next to Matt and
Katie and their genuine aircooled VW(tranny).  Probably the best that bus
has ever sounded! Good fun, and you won't soon hear the end of it, either.
We would have driven the more respectful limo had you brought the
barnambucamper.
