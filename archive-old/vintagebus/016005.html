I will never get how these people spell &quot;VOLKSWAGEN&quot;
incorrectly...it's spelled for him right on the rear
of the bus!  It also seems like people would want to
put the car in the correct area - Volkswagons - last
time I checked, don't exist.  Volkswagens, however,
do.  OR am I just missing something here?  That bus
isn't all that bad...at least looking at it from an
East Coast standpoint.  Heck - it looks better than my
crew cab did when I bought that!
