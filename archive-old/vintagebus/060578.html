Subject: Re: [VB] fabricating &amp; installing new front door panels

It's a good idea to tuck the bottom of the plastic into the door.   Since the 
water drains through the door, if you just stick the plastic on the face of 
the door, or on the back of the panel, it can drip between the plastic and 
the door.
