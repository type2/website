$17,300 would get you one heck of a nice bus!  Or 5 decent ones.  Or 15
projects...

If you think the NB prices are out of wack, then I guess I shouldn't
tell you about people paying $50k premiums to be the first on their block
with the new 911 turbos...  People sell their spot on the list for upwards
of $30k.

&lt;political&gt;
Now that we're headed for a recession, will the VW market - new, used and parts -
come back down out of the stratosphere?
&lt;/political&gt;

&gt; People that pay over sticker that much are foolish, I agree.  But obviously
&gt; you guys haven't checked into used car prices much.  NB's have a crazy
&gt; resale value!  When my girlfriend bought hers(2000 model) she paid less from
&gt; the dealer than we ever found a low mile used one for.  The dealers were
&gt; paying more for used ones at car auctions than they were buying them from VW
&gt; for.  This is 2 years after they have came out!  Her fully loaded 2000 model
&gt; with 30k still books for almost what she paid for it! $17,300.  She could
&gt; walk into the dealer today and trade it in on a new turbo and only making
&gt; payments on it one year not be upside down on it.  You can't name me any
&gt; other cars you can do that with paying less than $300 a month.  Like it or
&gt; not that's the way it is!
