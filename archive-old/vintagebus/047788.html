They are HIGHLY desirable. I know. I've had one for 26 years. Think about
having to get out in the rain every time you want to go from the front to
the back where you are camping/living to get something you left in front.

for the mid 6os they are fairly common.  actually, I dislike them.  I like
having the space on the seat next to me, or my honey on the seat next to me,
or if I am in the passenger seat I get much more leg room than in the
walkthroughs.    And a good plac eto put the spare tire, and misc junk as
well.   Bench seats rule!!!!!
