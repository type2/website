Subject: Re: [VB] Mystery dizzy

Definitely Bosch.  Sounds like a European Market, possibly Carbed Beetle for 
Europe.  I'll dig into a European Market Parts Fiche later today and see what I 
can come up with.

********************
&gt; I bought a used dizzy at the OCTO meet. It was real cheap, so I am not
&gt; out much if it is useless. It is a VW/Audi dizzy, doesn't say Bosch.
&gt; It has a vacuum can on it, single connection, so I assume that is a
&gt; vacuum advance. It is a tall dizzy, not one of the shorter ones that I
&gt; think went on the pancake engines. The number 050 is above the logos,
&gt; but I thought the 050 was a straight mechanical advance. The rest of
&gt; the numbering reads:
&gt; JFU4
&gt; 0 231 170 186
&gt; 043 905
