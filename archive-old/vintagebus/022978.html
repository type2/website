&gt;Waited till friday to post this one.  I was in orange county a couple of 
&gt;weeks ago, and ran into a nice bus owner, he was driving a late '63 kombi, 
&gt;what I thought was interesting was that it had &quot;innie&quot; vents, but small back 
&gt;hatch, fried egg turn signals, flip out front door handles.  The owner also 
&gt;told me that it had the bigger later brakes.  I can only remember the first 
&gt;three chassis #, 114 so I guess this bus was really close to the '64 
&gt;changeover.

Actually, he's not the only one.  My '63 (1139075, July 3rd) has innie
vents, small back window, fried eggs, and fridge handles.  I've only got
bigger brakes and a big nut tranny because a PO put a '67 trans in at one
time.  So yeah, I suppose it was a late '63 thing for a lot of us.  :)
