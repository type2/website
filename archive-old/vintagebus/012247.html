Hmm.  I think this would fall under &quot;fair use&quot; of the copyright laws.
But I'm no lawyer, and I don't play one at work, either...

On the otherhand, some guy just started a vintagevw_dot_com and vintagevw site,
both pointing to the same content.  I'd though of doing something
like that when I was picking domain names, but decided to go with
the more neutral vintagebu instead.  I know VW is pretty unforgiving
about copyright infringements, and the porschelist_dot_com site recently took
some heat from Porsche's lawyers.
