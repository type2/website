I disagree.  I just got it today through &quot;contacts&quot; at my local Wal Mart and
this thing rocks.  I'm used to having to pay between $15 and $20 for a
1:18th scale model.  Here you get TWO (smaller but not by much) with a
trailer.  I would have paid $17 and been happy.  These are not cheesy
plastic toys.  They are made by Maisto which is a good quality company.  The
fact that I paid $13 and some change still has me grinning.  I'm going back
tomorrow to see if I can score a Hot Wheels Bus.  If I see more of the bus
and bug combos I will pick them up too.  I gots friends to take care of.

&lt;&lt; Dear List,
 I purchased the bus/bug/trailer combo at a Western Michigan Wal-mart,
 and paid $17.95 for it.  I had mentioned to another list member about
 the great range in pricing in different parts of the country.
 Has anyone else paid this much?

I can definitely say it is not a 17.95 toy, wait for the hype to slow down
and then get one later, no big loss.
