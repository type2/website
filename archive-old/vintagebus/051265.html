Subject: RE: [VB] rack questions

I have a baywindow 6' industrial (no wood) rack from a '74 and it fits on my
'66 just fine.

The only downside is that there is not a whole lot of clearance between the
roof and rack ~1&quot; in the middle.

The rack is rated for 220lbs (from sticker on it and VW owners manual).
Also it had a manufacturing code of &quot;B1&quot; which I have no idea what means.

Basically if you run across a deal on a bay rack go for it!
