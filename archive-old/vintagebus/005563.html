&gt;   My friend put one in his 67 splitty with a stock bus 210 (215 should
&gt; work too)
&gt; flywheel with a bus stock clutch.. AND an adapter that comes on some new
&gt; clutches
&gt; that converts them for use in either new or old trannied cars id think.
&gt; If you find
&gt; this you could come out ahead. Fat performance makes ana adapter
&gt; flywheel as well..
&gt;
&gt;  Also dont forget you will have to fab an exaust of some sort.. Being in
&gt; a bus
&gt; you might get lucky and a later model bus exaust of some sort will bolt
&gt; right up.
&gt; My friend had to fab one.

Hey Jason that is COOL info to know.  You might give your buddies contact
info so that I can chat with him about this.  I'm prepared to make my own
exhaust - I can weld so a little chopping doesn't bother me much at all.  I
just gotta locate me either a 2L bus engine or hope that this Porsche 914
engine converts over to a 2L rather easily.
