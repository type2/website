&gt;etc.), hit drum with maul.  feel free to yell, it makes you stronger.
Hit
&gt; Clara


Speaking of yelling, banging, and strength, I had the most grievous time
with my rear lug nuts when I went to remove the wheels for powdercoating!  I
ended up sitting on the ground, one foot holding the 19mm box-end wrench on
the lug, two hands gripping a heavy carpentry hammer, bashing the other end
of the wrench with all my strength, whilst trying not to bash the new paint
off of the wheelwells...I only chipped one spot..(yay!)...and swearing,
growling, and generally debasing the ancestry of the recalcitrant lugs.
Good thing I had ear plugs in....Michele said I sounded like I wasn't having
fun....but I was!  No, really....I love reshaping pieces of metal with a
hammer.  Gotta remember to grind that new sharp lip off my wrench....

Have at you!   Aargh!  _at_$_at_#^*$&amp;*!

And then....ecstatic &quot;yessss!&quot;  when they finally started to turn....

Later!
