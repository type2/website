Subject: Adjusting Doors?

Has anyone had to adjust the door gaps on a Bus?  On the Panel I've got the
gap on the &quot;handle side&quot;  is a bit excessive.  How are these adjust to bring
the door back slightly?  I remember from my Body Work days we use to shim
the doors when they didn't have an adjustment there.  These door don't seem
to lend them self to shimming or adjusting much.

Dave
