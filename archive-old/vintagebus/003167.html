Ken, Clara, Bob, Rusty, Ron et al.:

Wow... looks like I 'done show'd up' back in the country just in time :)

 ... so did I miss much ;)

Just think, for those of us who have been members of this community for
years, you are now (prolly) immortalised along with Bob on the l'il round
disk of plastic ... not only I, but my children and grandchildren will be
able to enjoy Bob's knowledgeable, helpful -- and at times biting ;) --
advice for years to come (especially in those instances where I have been
the subject/catalyst/target that was receiving the advice).

Kudos to all who were involved in putting this together (sorry I missed the
party).

818 pages ... well I now have a winter project...


&gt; The CD is in hybrid Windows/Mac format and includes free Adobe Acrobat
&gt; software. Acrobat was chosen for the Sermons because it includes its own
&gt; search engine and it prints nice, too. Runs 19.95 + s&amp;h and for that we'll
&gt; throw in a free jewel case. =^ )

... but I need a '59 RHD, split jewel case ;)

Does it come with greasy fingerprints on it?

Bugs &amp; Things and Splits ... Oh, my!

Roy

BTW:  Ken: Of those 38,000 requests for sermons that you use to experience
on the web-site every week, I am sure that VanBondo &amp; I [or should I say our
resto projects] accounted for, at least, 25% ;)
