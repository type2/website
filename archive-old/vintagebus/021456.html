Subject: Wanted wheelwell cut outs
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hi.....I need some wheelwell cut outs

they need to be cut all the way up to the wheel arch or farther

the pair I just got were cut way too short and will not worK as the bus had 
big Chevy wheels on it and the wheelwell was cut to the max.

Anyone have any ?  I can pick them up at Kelly park if you are going

thanks for your help........
