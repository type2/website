Subject: Re: [VB] Oil temperature - Alternative sender?

&gt;The oil temperature sender was put in place of the oil pressure relief
bolts
(I use the word bolt very loosely here).  This sender is apparently the most
ideal for taking the temperature .  &lt;

Someone e-mailed me off list and made a good point.  There is not a whole
lot of oil flow going over the sensor here and you would be basically taking
the case temperature over the oil temperature.

Any thoughts on this?  


Thanks,
Adrian S. Pillow
