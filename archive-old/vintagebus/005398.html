Subject: Followup -- Idle cutoff woes
Message-ID: &lt;003e01be7417$ca391140$183fa4cd_at_tschroe-h&gt;

Just wanted to thank all those who sent
me advice on the cutoff solenoid which wouldn't
retract without thunking it with a 17mm combination
wrench (well, a 13mm would probably work, but I
digress). I installed a new one on Tuesday, and
have had no problems since.

Thanks again
