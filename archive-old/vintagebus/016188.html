I've taken worse and made it look better.

I don't recall ifthe rear seat stuff was there or no.  It looks like
it has fridge-style handles, which makes it early 63.

Compared to some of the bus welding I've done, rockers are a cake-walk.

It has all the gates, the DC side gates are worth the bid price in and
of themselves!

Motor?  A motor is EASY to get.
