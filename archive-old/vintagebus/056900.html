Subject: Re: [VB] california import and Paypal

What *really* sucks about PayPal is the &quot;Crack Whore&quot; business model,
in which after the first CC payment you accept, you gotta cough up 3% of
*all* transaction, cash *or* CC.

Kinda like tithing, I guess...

&gt;   The cost to the vendor are a lot higher then taking CC. Which in turn will
&gt; cost the consumer more. The cancel policy sucks and can hurt the vendor in
&gt; the long run. It cost the consumer and the vendor money. Pay Pal is a great
&gt; money maker for the owner but not for the users in my opinion.
