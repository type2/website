Subject: Radio static
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I have a 65 bus with a Saphire I radio. The radio
works great and gets great reception until I turn on
the wipers.  Then I start getting static. Nothing
terrible.  I can still hear the radio, its just
annoying (the static that is).

Is this a grounding issue with either the radio or the
wiper motor?  Which?  Or is this just the way things
are in the bus world?

Thanks
