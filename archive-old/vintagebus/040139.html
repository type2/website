&gt;Fix for this:
&gt;
&gt;Clean both the tube and the hole with spray carb cleaner and make  sure
&gt;that it is clean and dry.
&gt;
&gt;Use a flat file and roll the metal tube back and forth on a flat surface
&gt;to put a bit of knurl on the part of the tube that goes into the hole.
&gt;
&gt;Mix up a bit of JB-weld according to the instructions.
&gt;
&gt;Smear this lightly on the knurled end of the tube.
&gt;
&gt;Gently tap the tube into the hole.  The JB-weld will form a bead around
&gt;the tube where it goes into the hole.
&gt;
&gt;Let it cure for a couple of days.
&gt;
&gt;I do this if the tube can be pulled out of the hole with pliars.  Better
&gt;safe than sorry


Follow with a small punch. Hit the aluminum of the pump where the tube goes 
in. There might even be a mark where this had been done before. The idea is 
to put a dimple that holds the tube in. Do this while the JB weld is setting 
up.

By the way, the posts about the VW mechanic are related to this topic. The 
old fuel pumps no longer have the rebuild kits available (AFAIK) maybe he 
has some????
Mine are long gone.........
