&lt;&lt; Where canI  find those nos 55 tail light assembly's ?  I've been looking 
for months now and all I can find are from 58+.

I keep seeing them at shows etc.  if your 57 is a us model- ie blinkie turn 
lights these are not the taillights you want.  They have one connector for 
one wire- they are taillight only- your bus needs tallights with two 
connectors for wires- taillights AND blinkie lights.   better to use the mid 
57 through 58 kind really, than these. 

If you do have a semaphore bus then those flat glass attachment screws on the 
inside of the engine compartment lights are correct for the post barndoor 
brake light decklight semaphore buses.  go get em.  cheaper than the us 
version.I've seen them $100 to $150 a pair for the euro ones, more for used 
us ones.
