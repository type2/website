 Anyone ever try it themselves?  Just looking through the harbor fright site 
 and saw the above item on sale.

Seems to me that one needs an oven to hold the parts. My hand had a beautiful 
idea
to use our neighbor's stove oven, but we never got around to trying it before 
we moved out. We have ever since thught about powder coating ourselves, but 
never got around to trying it. I Know that the Harbor Freight Tools system is 
a minimal powder coating system. It seems more like a toy to me and will work 
your ass off. But it might work,
minimally.
