Subject: Safari seepage mystery solved??

 Hi,

Was at OCTO today and had the chance to take a good look at several
safari's. They all have a joint at the lower center vertical section.
The seals will never seal up that little crack and a little water will
always seep through at that joint. You all might bridge that gap with
a small bit of silicone seal so that the rubber windshield seal has a
surface to touch and seal against. All be it that the joint is small,
but water will go right down the joint past the point where the seal
is supposed to be touching. How wide is that joint? Well I would guess
that it is around 15 to 20 thousandths of an inch and water will run
right through it and produce a slow drip.

There you have it, another theory. Would like to see some feedback
sometime.

Chris
