It wasn't that obvious in the original mail from Ted the Treasurer, but
PayPal is already set up and running and we'd love you to donate that
way:

&gt;Donations to the list support fund should be sent to:
&gt;
&gt;		Type2 Fundraiser
&gt;		C/O Ted Finesman
&gt;		8405 Reading Rd.
&gt;		Cincinnati, Oh. 45215
&gt;		1-877-517-4811 (toll-free for any questions or information)
&gt;		tedebare_at_one_dot_net (for pay-pal)

If you need to establish a new PayPal account, please use
tedebare_at_one_dot_net as a reference. This earns both you and us five
dollars. PayPal will be a new concept to some people; it is an
electronic payment service commonly used to pay for stuff bought from
online auction sites. Start here:

&gt;Missy:
&gt;I'd second that idea: Taking  donations by Paypal is a good idea!
&gt;My attention span gets interrupted after I leave the computer! with Paypal I DO
&gt;IT NOW!

&gt;&gt; the paypal idea is a good one...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; someone might want to check on this, but...paypal has a referral bonus to
&gt;&gt; the person that referred and a sign-up bonus for the new person.  the
&gt;&gt; listmaster could set up an account and everyone (that was new to paypal)
&gt;&gt; can use the listmaster as the referral, therefore giving $5 to the
&gt;&gt; listmaster.  then the new member can give the $5 bonus they received to the
&gt;&gt; list.  The end result....each new member ends up donating $10 of paypal's
&gt;&gt; money to our cause.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; anyway, i love this list.  tell me when and where, i'll donate.
