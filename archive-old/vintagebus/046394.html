&lt;&lt; What state do you live in that inspects the parking brake et al to get 
your 
 &gt;tags?
 
 TEXAS. Registration and inspection are 2 different things. But you can't
 drive around without either one of the stickers or you get popped by &quot;the
 FUZZ&quot;. &gt;&gt;
nc was the same way, tho a good ol' boy could usually be found who would look 
things over. Now I live in OR and we dont have any of that. kind of nice if 
your bus is a beater.
