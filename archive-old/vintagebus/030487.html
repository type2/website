An absolute MUST.  I helped my neighbor extend his garage in to a double length
garage and the urinal is over in the corner.  (not enough drop to put a throne in
there, unless it was mounted up on a pedestal)

The urinal is one of the most used tools in the shop.

Makes it real easy to work non-stop getting a bus back on the road.

Congrats on the upcoming building, we'll be watching the progress.
