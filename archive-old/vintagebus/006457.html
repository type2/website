Attention Barndoor Shoppers,
Anyone interested in a barndoor but doesn't place the winning bid on the
current auction subject
should check out the UK based '51 Standard on Everett's site.
At today's exchange rate the price is $6,555.73 plus shipping to the US.
But, it's believed to be the oldest bus in the UK and certainly looks worth
saving.
I suppose there's a UK news group somewhere whining about buses going to the
U.S..
I'd rather see it in the US than the far east. But wherever it ends up, I
hope it finds a good home.
John Flowers
