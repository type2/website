I have a colleague who grew up in Namibia, a southern African contry that is
covered almost completely by the Namib desert. It gets as hot in parts of
Namibia as anywhere in the world. He travelled all over the country for two
years in a stock 1600 beetle that he bought new in '74.

He was a dumbass student at the time and says that he subscribed to the
'throttle as an on off switch' school of thought. The beetle lasted for just
over two years and died, not as a result of overheating, but from a head on
collision with a truck.

My 1600 DP runs cool(spit and dipstick test) in the height of a South
African summer when the doublecab is loaded with 3/4 of a ton of pine
cones(excellent bonfire medicine when when you set fire to them all at
once).  

Later 

Michael
