When you  say &quot;widest fan&quot; what are you referring to? I'm a vw mechanical 
novice (though  between us, my wife and I have owned an even  dozen).



Hi SloJason,
VW as the air cooled flat four evolved from 20 HP, to 25 HP, to 36 HP, to  
40HP (36 &amp; 40 HP have the same diameter P&amp;Cs 77mm, and crank throw  64mm 
measurement), to 1300, to 1500, to 1600, lower pulley, upper pulley  ratio changed 
and the width of the cooling fan changed.  29mm seems to have  been the last fan 
width used on 1600 SP non-doghouse engines, and  using this or less sized 
fans, on a doghouse cooled engine is a big  mistake.  Dog house is very good at 
not preheating the cooling air going to  the #3 cylinder, which is the most 
probable cylinder to have an exhaust valve  snap off!   Even in the 1963-67 
Workshop Manual VW Transporter, there  is a mention of using a slightly larger 
lower pulley to increase cooling at  higher RPMs (see section M-6, page 6), and 
shows how to drill the early 40 HP  head fins for better cooling.  This latter 
part can also be used in  modified form on 1300-1600 heads and just cleaning 
out the casting flash in the  head fins is a must.
