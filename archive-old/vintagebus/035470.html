&lt;&lt; I've been thinking about getting an engine stand lately.  I saw an engine 
 bolted to one at the classic.  From what I could tell it had the loaf tranny 
 bell housing bolted to it and the engine bolted to that.
 

Theres a fellow in the area that had a water pump deal that was meant to run 
off a vw engine. It has mounting holes to bolt it to a bench. Hes removed the 
engine, starter etc. and wants $100 for it. seems as though it could be quite 
functional as a test stand while being cool for what it is just sitting 
there. if interested, I could check to see if he still has it. Or he may 
bring it to the show at springfield german this sunday.
 



I didnt see any actual engine stands for sale other than the little roll 
 around dollies.  While checking out your favorite auction site and mine, I 
 came across this:
 
 
http://cgi.ebay_dot_com/ebaymotors/aw-cgi/ebayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=351265032&amp;r=
 0&amp;t=0
 
 It's a standard engine stand, but adjustable in many ways.  If I were to 
 acquire something like this.  Could I conceivably adjust the arms to fit the 
 bellhousing, bolt the bellhousing to the stand and then, when ready, bolt 
the 
 engine to the bellhousing?
 
 Am i crazy or right on track?
