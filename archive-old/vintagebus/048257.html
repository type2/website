Subject: VW People Bashing (it's almost Friday)
To: VintageBus_at_type2_dot_com

I was looking over the Forums on Everetts site http://thesamba_dot_com/vw and was 
rather amazed at the amount of people bashing going on there!  Wow, and I 
thought this list could be a little bit harsh at times.  Just glad that this 
list is not like that. Keep up the good work Thom and everyone else!  

Sorry I should probably have posted this on Friday (tomorrow) but I just 
COULDN'T wait!

Mr. Impatient Dan Howard
I love my bus, no not like that!
