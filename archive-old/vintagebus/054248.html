&gt; What is the best approach to take with the DMV to get it registered?

From my experience and failing memory, you obtain insurance first, and
take the rear plate, bill of sale, and yourself into the DMV, and tell'em
you bought it, and you need to create a new pink slip, and get it
registered. Take some blank checks too. That oughta do it.
