I think that the June shows and t-shirts (for most
years) was about the best thing that ever came of that
group. Although that was my personal impression, I am
at the point of using the remaining worn out shirts as
shop rags when changing oil and tranny fluid. Rust
never sleeps and all things must change... every 3000
miles or so.
Actually placed a few of them and old AZ Bus Club tie
dies in the '54 Barnambulator prior to sending it
East.
