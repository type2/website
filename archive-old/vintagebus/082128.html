&gt; I am a little puzzled as to why you have a 30/31 on a

&gt; Why not a 34?
&gt; Do you have the oddball center section that uses the
&gt; 30 carb spacing?
&gt; Or do you have a reducer on the intake?

I have a 30/31 on both my dual port VWs.  One with a 30mm center section
that I picked up at a pick-a-part (didn't know I had exactly the part I
wanted until I got it home and tried to use an adapter on it!) and the
other is on an adapter.  Both worked very well right out of the box.
