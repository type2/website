Quoth Eric &amp; Barb's post:
&lt;&lt; I have never done this before. Muir says to use two scissors jacks and a
 block of wood. Is it possible to use a floor jack? &gt;&gt;
Hi Brad,
It is not only possible, it is far more safer for both you and your engine.
Plus ten times easier to install with a floor jack.  Eric&amp;Barb
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
In my 71 bus, when I had to pull the engine a number of times to track an
oil leak (turned out to be a hidden crack behind the flywheel) I got very
proficient in pulling the engine with a bunch of 2x6 pieces, 2 scissor
jacks, a 2x3 foot ply board with a rope tied to holes at the front, 3
pieces of broom handle about 2 ft long and a sledge hammer!
Drive the rear wheels onto about 4&quot; worth of ramp (couple of 2x6 stock
pieces nailed together).  Place the board on broomsticks under the engine
and place the scissors jacks on the board...I added some blocks nailed to
the board so the jacks had the right position (toed in at the front,
straddling the sump cover).  Crank up the jacks to hold the engine and do
the carrier unbolting thing and cable/gas line dissconnection.  Lower the
engine to a LEVEL position and block up the trans either by a chain or just
another jack or concrete block.  The point is that one can more easily get
to the top engine nuts this way when the fanhousing is angled down a bit..
I was so good, I cranked 2 handles at once and controlled the level
position of the jacks while lowering!  Once the engine bolts are loose,
just roll back the engine (grab the heat risers) and let it down.  I'd pull
it back, and prop boards under the heaterboxes to stabilize working on the
engine.  Reinstalling was quite easy doing it alone if engine came from the
shop...- tip the engine sideways (on the board) using a long 2x4 under the
heater box, add a 2x4 or 6 piece on one side- tip the other, add, etc,
until you can slip the collapsed jacks under.   Push in place in front of
the trans, switching the broom sticks as one rolled out- I controlled their
direction with the sledge.  Jack up so ring of release plate centers on the
trans shaft, then align the side to side position by whacking the board
with the hammer.  Now with my current 78 bus, I do use a rolling floor jack
for the heavier engine!
