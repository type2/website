Subject: HIgh county bus fest and Weber 32/36
Date: Thu, 2 Jul 1998 13:59:03 -0400

The High Country Bus Fest is coming up in a few weeks and Mike&quot;Buddah&quot; Myers
has relocated and I missed the t-shirt deadline. Mike, are you out there. I
am beggin' for an extension.

Bus content.

I am experiencing at lot of dieseling and run on and after a check of the
Beta version of the search engine it seems it might be carb related. Does
anyone out there have a set of instructions or diagrams for a Weber 32/36.
This is a typeIV engine ( sorry Thom.)

Thanks
Chris
