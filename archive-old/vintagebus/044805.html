Smehow in the hundreds of VB mails I get every day (335 was last count) I 
missed your response until now.  Finally clearing the sludge from my mailbox. 
 Eric and Barb (VeewWee) seem to think the problem is a worn out drum.  This 
makes sense to me because that wheel has gone through some rough times in the 
past few months.  I had clogged brake lines (original flexlines according to 
local VW specialists) that forced a seizure of my breaks during a short road 
trip which in turn caused the paint on my rim to peel from the friction heat. 
 Fortunately my tire didn't blow.  The lines were replaced and I went on my 
merry way until a few weeks later when the cylinder on that wheel blew and 
bleed brake fluid everywhere.  I replaced that and once again went on my 
merry way. I failed to inspect the drums on both occasions and probably could 
have saved my self some heartache.  Now the connecting bar is popping out of 
place.  Well, if the drums are worn enough and the pads have to move that 
much farther to hit the drum to stop the wheel then yes I am leaving enough 
space for the bar to fall out of place and really stressing the new cylinder. 
 The little pistons should only have to move so far and realizing this I have 
opted to park the bus rather than risk another blow out.  Unfortunately none 
of the local FLAPS stock the parts I need so I'm gonna mail order them and 
ride my bike to work in the meantime.  On the flip side, this will give me an 
opportunity to dismantle my door and install the new window regulator.  
Living in Florida with windows that don't roll down really sucks.

Yet another mystery solved.  (for now)
