Well, at a current price of roughly $600 per ounce for platinum, of
course they're going to be expensive.  Maybe you should consider going
with something a bit cheaper, like gold ($264/oz) or silver
($4.70/oz).  Or if you *do* decide for that 100-point resto, go for
rhodium ($1700).  I have trouble believing that sitting on metal mesh
of any type is going to be all that comfortable during either
temperature extreme, though.

Oh, you were talking about colour, not material.  Never mind.
