&gt;hi again
&gt;
&gt;I plan on occasionally using my bus this winter for short ski trips.  I
&gt;am thinking about putting a propane bottle on my roof rack and running a
&gt;hose from that through the pop out window to a propane heater and/or
&gt;stove. Given that I don't plan on driving with this heater on - is there
&gt;anything i should be concerned about.


Using a heater that burns it's fuel inside of an inclosed compartment that
is used for sleeping is not a good idea, but there are many heaters on the
market that can be placed inside the engine bay much like a gasoline heater
that use propane for fuel.  Here is a list of some interesting heaters, my
favorite is the Zodi.
