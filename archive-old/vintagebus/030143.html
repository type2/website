Subject: running a govenor (another Q)

thanks for all hwo replied to this.  It looks like i do NOT have the
right intake manifold.  I am using a stoke unit which is why my carb is
too high.  My new Q's then.

1.  Can a stock one be shortened to match an original one and still
look/work right?
2.  Does anyone have a correct one FS?
3.  Anyone know the cutoff chassis S/N for when VW went from the
accelerator return spring on the cable to on the carb?  (Probably when
they went from a 28 PICT to the 30 PICT carb.

Thanks
Matt
