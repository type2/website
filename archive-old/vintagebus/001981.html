Subject: removing gen brushes I need help

Red light suddenly on very bright.  Gets dimmer when engine is revved.  Can
anyone give me some guidance here?  I can barely fit my head in to see into
the top of the generator.  I pushed on the part that holds the brushes, but
no spark at all, that I could see.  The brushes feel tiny, almost not there,
I think.  Are they going to be locally available?.  Funny how I have five
cars, and in the course of two days three of them become undriveable, just
when I have to go back to work.

Don
