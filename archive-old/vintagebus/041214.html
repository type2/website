Happy Sunday everybody.

A few new pieces of tin and some oil and I'll be ready to put the new
engine in the old bus and fire it up for the first time. I only get to
do this once, so I'd really like to get it right.

As I understand it, I should fill this thing up with non-detergent oil
(weight?) first time. Fire it up and run it at about 1500 rpms for 20
minutes while trying to get the timing (and carb?) set right. Drain
the oil and let the engine cool. Re-torque the head bolts (case nuts
too?), re-adjust the valves. Fill it back up with detergent oil
(weight?) and then take it for a drive of about five miles, varying
vehicle speed, shifting gears often. Change the oil again, check
torque on head bolts and valve adjustment. Barring any other problems
(yeah, right) she's good to go to Red Barn. Right? Or not.

Now I confess I have never done this before, and would welcome advice
from those who have.

One other question: do those little piggy-back devices that let you
add an oil temp gauge onto the low oil pressure warning sender hole
work acceptably? I have one from the old dead engine and am wondering
if it is worth transferring over to the new engine.

Thanks,
Joel
