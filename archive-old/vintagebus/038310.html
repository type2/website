Here is a better one!  My friend Paul rebearinged a bug tranny that was to
be installed in his panel. He worked through the night to have the bus ready
for a long anticipated road trip. When the tranny installation was complete
he found that he had 4 reverse gears and only 1 very low ratio forward gear.
He had installed the crown wheel bug wise! 

Later
