Subject: Shifter extention

I'm keeping my '62 23-window deluxe at another location 'til the '59
project is finished (by order of the wife!). I was out there admiring it
when I noticed it had one of those shifter extentions. It's not one of the
new ones I see on every bus in the mags. I hadn't noticed it 'cause it
matched the shifter so well &amp; with no engine or transaxle in the bus, my
hands weren't really ever on it. Anyway, I was wondering how common it is &amp;
if it was worth anything much. You can see a picture of it at:

The knob on it has the shift pattern on it. It's removable as well. I like
this shifter extention much better than the ones I see for sale in the
catalogs. What be fair market value of this at a swap? Thanks for any info.
