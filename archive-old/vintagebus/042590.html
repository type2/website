&gt; rebuild kits though...shouldn't matter too much as the rear cylinders

&gt; of the bus use the same front wheel cylinders as the 62 does...
&gt; 
&gt; just thought I'd let you all know
&gt; 
&gt; BFY Obsolete Parts - 1.800.789.0900

I almost ordered mine from BFY, but they wanted $6 and busdepot wanted
$4... but if busdepot is out of stock, BFY would be my second choice on
this item. Heck, i might go to NAPA and get em the next day as they are $7
there... with no shipping.

take care,

Steve
