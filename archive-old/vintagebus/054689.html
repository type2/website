&gt; Hey JP you have any idea if the fabric you have is
&gt; still available?  I would like to buy some it looks
&gt; good.  Is it wool or cotton or??
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!
&gt; Tds

Todd, It's the cheapest material that I could find. 
Not deliberately, it just looked right.  It's muslin
and it cost me $.99 a yard.  It was way in the back of
the store, and they had tons of it (or at least, bolts
of it).
