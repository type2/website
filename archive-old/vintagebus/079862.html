&gt; Maybe its time to run through this airflow model again. It occurred to me

My use of the term &quot;choked flow&quot; is only in reference to the upper limit
of airflow being reached at less than the maximum RPM of the engine.
There would still be higher pressure in the shroud than outside, so
nothing will leak in.

It would be interesting to set up a test and run the fan
electrically while measuring air velocity into the fan inlet.  This would
settle the discussion about whether choked flow occurs or not.  I believe
it does, based upon feeling the airflow leaving the engine at various
engine speeds.  The flow feels the same to me at 4000 as it does at 3000,
but I haven't put any instrumentation on it.
