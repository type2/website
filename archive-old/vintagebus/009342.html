I've got a real concern here folks.  I haven't put my 1776 in the bus yet
but it's gonna HAVE to happen before the July 15th OVWC show in Omaha, NE.
Here's what I'm concerned about.

It's no secret that putting a freeway flier trans in a bus drops the rpm of
the engine in relation to the speed of the vehicle.  With my 1600DP and a
mild load, it just can't hack it - I was driving floored back from KCMO.
The engine was working really hard too.

Does this mean that no matter what Type 1 engine size  I run (anything from
a 1600DP up to a big old 2.2 litre), I'm condemned to overheating or will
the 1776 give me enough power gains to pull me out of this slump?  Even
though I like to cruise fast in the bus, I don't like running hot so I'm
half tempted to yank my flier and sell it and run the stock 67 trans.

I'd like to hear comments and real world experiences.  Thanks!
