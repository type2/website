Subject: How much oil can my trans leak?

Hi everybody.

Well, I finally got ol' DARTHVW back on the road after
three months of sitting (I was rechroming door
handles, etc. long story)
I put some stuff back on him so I could enjoy driving
around while the weather's still nice, then I plan to
do the full resto (i.e. un-DARTHing) starting in
November.

ANYWAY... I want to drive the bus once or twice a week
for the next three months, but the tranny leaks oil
from the side flange plate at a SICK rate (about 4 to
6 tablespoons a day, as far as I can tell).

so, my question is...

If the tranny leaks oil at a rate of about 5
tablespoons a day, how many days until I need to get
under there and top it off again?
It took 12 fl. Ozs. this morning after it had been
sitting for three months.

BTW, I feel really cheesy asking this question,
because I DON'T like driving a super-leaky bus around.
I bring a piece of shag rug that I put under it to
catch the drip when it's parked for long periods of
time, so my oil doesn't end up in the ocean.

I would fix/seal it but I just don't have the time to
pull it and do it right. I'm trying to hold out until
the full resto in November. 

Actually, maybe I can wrap one of my daughter's
HUGGIES size 3 diapers under there for now. Hmmm.


Thanks for listening,
