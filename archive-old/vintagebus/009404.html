Yo, whassup.

I work in a bookstore, and I've been trying to order the big Bentley manual for 63-67 through my wholesalers cause I'm poor.  Well, I figured out how to do it, just wasn't jumping through the right hoops.  I ordered two to make the distributor's minimum order requirements so I've got an extra for sale.  It's brand new in the shrink wrap, and I only need $70 to cover the cost of the book and shipping so that's what I'm asking.  I'm selling this at my cost, so I'll have to add shipping if someone wants me to mail it.  Book rate shipping's not too expensive.

I am going to Busses By the Arch though, and I'll be bringing it as well as my remaining supply of 72-79 parts to hopefully sell to get by.  Just look for the blue/white 66 deluxe with the roofrack and Elvis tapestry.  I'll be there Friday night through Monday.  Surgery couldn't keep me away from BBA!!!!

Keep your valves tight, but not too tight...
