Subject: 21 window for sale

Heard about this from a friend this is all the info I've got.  It's in the
Portsmouth Va area.
&quot;A guy is selling a 21 window bus. not sure how much but it has allot of
parts. Call him at cell 757 450 4990 and home 428 6087. His name is Jamie.&quot;

&quot;I read somewhere that 77 per cent of all the
mentally ill live in poverty. Actually, I'm more intrigued
by the 23 per cent who are apparently doing quite well
for themselves.&quot;
