&gt;I have a few somewhat &quot;rare&quot; bus parts and I would like to get an idea
of what they may be worth.I have a set of Empi front steps that are in pretty
good shape only a few cracks in the rubber.I also have a nice pair of deluxe
bumper trim (front).I am interested in trading them for some parts I really
need, so if you guys can give me any Ideas I would appreciate it.
&gt;
IMHO:
EMPI steps = $100/pair?  Last set I saw needed a little work for $50
Deluxe front bumper trim - $40?  Unless it's ribbed bumper trim

What rare parts do you have?  You forgot to list those.
