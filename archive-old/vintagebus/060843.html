Subject: Re: [VB] How do they do it??

Flatten the tire before install/removal?


&gt; The only real b*tch of the entire process was getting the 195/50-15
&gt; tires &amp; wheels back on. My rear fenders are neither cut nor flared and I
&gt; ended up having to put the wheel into the fender well over the stub axle
&gt; and _then_ put the brake drum on inside it. Wouldn't go on any other
&gt; way.
&gt;
&gt; Can't wait to get a flat and have to pull half my rear suspension to
&gt; change the tire. &lt;rolling eyes&gt; Anybody out there have any suggestions
&gt; on how to get around this? Please spare me the &quot;put it back to stock&quot;
