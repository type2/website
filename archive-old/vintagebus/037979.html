rims....thanks! &gt;&gt;

Hi Gene,
You are welcome!  The main thing is to explain to him that you are not 
worried with having the special order white outer color coating getting on 
the 80% semigloss black inner coating.  BTW powder coatings when special 
ordered are best used up within about 6 months or the powder sitting on the 
self starts to turn into chunks like sugar left in a container too long.  Our 
shop was able to repowder and use the special order white color even after 6 
years on the shelf somehow, but not all shops may be able to do this!
