&lt;&lt;  am in the process of attempting to replace the
 plastic bushing and the &quot;shift rod guide&quot; on the front
 shift rod of my 65 doublecab.  This is the type with
 the metal guide that goes around a plastic sleeve that
 fits around the shift rod itself.  (The guide ring is
 broken, making for interesting shifting.)

did you get a good metal guide piece?   That same piece was broken on my 65 
westy when I got it, made for impossible shifting,  and so one of the things 
I had to do before driving it was replace that.  I think they are selling 
them new, and early beetles (?) take the same part
