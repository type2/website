Well, I'm not sure if this is your problem, but once, when that was
happening to my bug (oh god, I know, but I swear, I'm working on my BUS to
get it driving, heh) I had an intake leak around the base of the carb.  You
might also want to make sure you don't have any vacuum lines open anywhere.

Hope this helps

&gt; I thought I was good with carbs, but I guess not.;-)
&gt;
&gt; I just put a 30/31pict on my 1600 with a 009 dizzy.  The bus cranks and
&gt; idles, but when you come off idle, the engine dies.  It's as if the carb
&gt; doesn't want to switch to the progression circuit from the idle circuit.
&gt;  I looked at the accelerator pump, and it squirts gas alright.  I think
&gt; the &quot;squirt amount&quot; is also adjustable by changing the pump rod.  Should
&gt; I try to change this so it squirts more gas?  Or is it something else?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Christen
