Hey Erin,
Take John Muir's advice and just step back for awhile. I'm one of many
listees who've read and looked forward to your ongoing daily posts.
I can only speak for myself, but I hope that you take a breather, regroup
financially, take stock of the lessons learned and resolve to build a better
bus for it.
I'm not a serious restoration guy, my Westy is original but kind of  a
beater-lookin' been around awhile sort, but then again so am I.
Suck it up and muddle through, lots of us are pullin for you, and we look
forward to seeing your bus at some events next summer. I hope you make it to
Busses Nowhere Near the Arch next Labor Day.
(Come to think of it, I hope I make it there).
Good Luck
John Flowers
