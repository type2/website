I've gotten several queries, all along the lines of &quot;what's the best
offer you've gotten so far, so I can try to beat it&quot;.  The answer is
&quot;no offers mentioning actual dollar amounts&quot;.  So, since I have no use
for the engine, it's cluttering up the garage, and no one seems to
really want it, my plan is to drop it off at the metal recycling place
Friday.  If I actually get any offers of money for it before
6pm Thursday, the best one gets it.  This assumes that said offer is
sufficient to at least cover shipping, which I figure to run $30-$40.
