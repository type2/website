Subject: fan shroud ?s

Hey All,

New probs have developed;)  Thanks for the info on the oil filler it wked 
Clara!  Anyway I replace my fan belt it was a little tight but not tight 
enough to drop my generator riping out the bolt from the fan! OUCH!  Anyway 
gonna have to pull the engine and replace atleast the fan and bolt!  Can I 
keep my shroud and just replace the fan or should I just replace everything 
in the shroud?  I have access to a vw yard and should be able to pull the 
parts easy.  My engine is a 1600DP '74 AK case.  Anything I should know 
before I grab new parts.  I have the Dog House cooler and all that.  If it 
is easier and cheap I will replace the shroud regarless then I won't have to 
tack weld that thing metioned earlier!

TIA

Eric
