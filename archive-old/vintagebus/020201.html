Yes, but I qualified it by thanking the rice boys for upping the ante - locally, my
bus is a smudge on the carpet compared to some of the extravagant paint jobs and
sticker schemes of the local Honda Honeys.  A guards red 911 is downright dowdy by
current standards, stands out like Kate Moss at the Playboy mansion...

&gt; Oh, please.  This from the man with a BRIGHT yellow panel van you could see 3 miles away and a
