Subject: more 40IDF Weber Data

Thanks for all of the input. OUCH! 16mpg is brutal. I have been making a
recomended jetting chart with recomendations from different sources. I will
add your experience to the list.
My duals were set stock:
Venturi 28, Emulsion F11, Air correction 200, Main Jet 115, Idle jet 50

Kymco recomended:
Venturi 30-32, Emulsion F11, Air correction 165-175, Main Jet 120-130, Idle
jet 55

NW connecting rod: (guys building my motor)
Venturi 31-32, Emulsion F7, Air correction ?(I need to ask), Main jet 125,
Idle 50,55

The Weber manual:
Venturi 28, Emulsion F11, Air correction 210, Main jet 140, Idle jet 55

The Mileage Motor: (Article from Hot VW's)
Venturi ? (did not give Venturi size guessing 28), Emulsion F11, Air
Correction 200, Main Jet 130, Idle 50
this motor was a 1600 that they claimed to achieve 32.1 with 50% highway /
50% town mileage in a bug.

Mike G:
Venturi 28, Emulsion F7, Air Correction 185, Main jet 125, Idle jet 50
comments: 16MPG, seems rich

Jerry at NW Connecting Rod said they had troubles getting cars through
emissions with the smaller venturis. The way I understand it is the air
speed was so high it would pull extra fuel through in an uncontrolled
manner. With the larger venturi they were able to more accurately dial in
the mixture. I did not ask &quot;Kymco&quot; about their theory on the larger venturi.

This is all I have come up with so far, but I will keep you posted. I
really want to get at least 20mpg. I am trying to nail this the first time,
these jets are expensive and the emulsion tubes and venturis are really
expensive.

thanks again,
