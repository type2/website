&lt;&lt; Is the vent from the top of the oil-filler clear and connected to the

 Is the road tube (the one going down alongside the oil-filler) clear? If 
these are blocked, you will force oil out past the slinger on the crank 
pulley. &gt;&gt;
Hi Volks,
Definitely!  Plus check the hose from the oil filler to the air cleaner to 
make sure it is not clogged with oil/water mayo looking stuff.  This will 
often happen if you are not running a thermostatic bellow/flaps system on the 
engine.  Lastly if both or either of the valve cover gaskets is hanging 
downward from the topside of the covers this will allow air to get into the 
engine, and pressure out the oil.   Eric&amp;Barb
