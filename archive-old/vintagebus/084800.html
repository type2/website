&gt; Has anyone used the VW vehicle trolley when working on their bus.
&gt; The trolley I'm talking about is VW Tool # 603.

Looking at the plans (VW603/3, edition 11/63) at the doc project, it
looks like the two posts with the rubber bumpers are welded to the
trolley, and appear to contact some part of the pan or frame near the
front wheels.  The two posts with the half-loops can come off the
trolley, and go under the rear torsion tube on a Bug.  The half-loop
posts can be replaced by some other posts (part 23) that are basically
a piece of bent tube.  I wonder if these bent-tube posts are what you
need to make the trolley work on a Bus.  A further vote for this
theory may be that there is a third set of posts (VW 603/4) that can
replace the half-loop posts for a Type 3.

You might compare the ones you have to the ones I am looking at, which
are from http://failsure_dot_net/oacdp/ , to see what you think.
