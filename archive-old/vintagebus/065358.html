I had pretty much the same question when I replaced my drag link.  The new
one came without a cotter pin hole and with a nylock nut.  One of the more
knowledgeable people on the list replied that many manufacturers have gone
to nylock nuts on rod ends.  That was about 20K miles ago.

If the nylock nut were to loosen (not at all likely) the steering would
get very sloppy before the nut backed off all the way.  This provides a
safety margin for even the most paranoid of us.
