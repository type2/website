Rumor through the VW Dealer is that the 2.0 w/c golf/jetta engine is now
being built in Brazil, as is the 2001 Golf, since VW of Germany can't
even keep up with the production.  VW of Mexico is trying to deligate as
it tools up for production of the Convertible NB.

I seem to remember SCAT trying to bring in a few tarps for trucks when
they were importing the bastard bay window crew cabs in the late
80s/early 90s.  They said no one was interested in the small
quantities.  Those that were had nothing to do with VW.

&gt; getting parts from Brazil was never easy.....
&gt; 
&gt; all the suppliers have problems with their orders and getting them shipped.
&gt; 
&gt; VW Brazil is like VW Germany and does not really care abvout the old car
&gt; market.
&gt; they make their money on building new cars ,
&gt; this is going to get worse soon as VW is moving some of their Mexican
&gt; production to Brazil, the &quot;suitcase&quot; bus is now built in Brazil and soon the
&gt; Golf + Jetta,
&gt; 
&gt; the VW official factory will be very busy..........
&gt; 
&gt; then you will have to deaL with the suppliers that do not have a contract
&gt; with VW for parts on these new cars,
&gt; which will probably mean 2nd + 3rd string companies for the small run parts
&gt; it just not worth it to set up to run 100-500-1000 parts when they are
&gt; supplying new parts for new cars........
&gt; 
&gt; big companies like Varta , Cima etc that sell to the whole VW market will
&gt; hopefully keep supplying aircooled parts.......
