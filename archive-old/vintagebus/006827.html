Subject: [VB] CB Performance heads ordered


I called CB this morning and ordered a slew of stuff.  I talked with some
gal there who answered my questions and she sure seemed knowledgeable about
stuff.  I thought it was rather cool.

I'm getting the 044 Supermags with the 90.5 and larger valve sizes with SS
valves.  I also ordered caps, J-tubes, exhaust nuts, the .040 copper head
washers, and couple other small items.  I'm sure the Bill will be close to
$600/$700 but what the hell, it's only money right?  I figure for the
performance I want and the carbs I have along with the solid bottom end, I
just as well treat myself out to some good performance - especially since
I'm tearing this engine apart for the 2nd time.

I'm sticking with the 1 1/2&quot; header because she said the displacement I'm
running along with the lower compression and bus application, my current
exhaust will work just fine.

So I'll keep you all posted on my progress.
