I have a full length z-bed that I recovered in vinyl that is very close to
carmel brown (so it matches my front seat) and I made some cushions and
recovered them in this wool fabric that fit over the engine compartment - it
is perfect. It had speaker holes cut in it so I put this 1/8&quot; hardboard on
the outside and inside and went to a paint store and got paint the is very
close to carmel brown and I painted the front part and the back part carmel
brown.  I had to cut a slot in the bottom for the heater log - but I guess
with a Kombi you wouldn't have to do even that.  I can't imagine that you
could ever make something that is as versitile as a full length z-bed for
the $75.00 (maybe $45.00 US)  it cost me. And 10 minutes work and the z-bed
is out and the factory seat is back in - fits me perfectly. I too didn't
want to make my bus a westy, or fulltime camper cause I like to haul stuff
on occasion.


&gt; I was wondering if anyone has a Foreign Car Guide or suitable vintage
&gt; publication that would have plans on making your own camper bed for the
back
&gt; of the bus. I thought I had seen something like this before? I got a kombi
&gt; that I dont want to make into a westy, but would like to make a bed that I
&gt; could put in on special occasions.
