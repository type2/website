I took all six of my frames apart because, as Thom said, aftermarket frames 
are horrible.  To do this, rip out your old outer seal and locate the four 
frame screws.  You will notice that two of the screws are probably clean and 
two are rusty.  The clean two 'should' come out pretty easily, but if they 
don't, cover the things with WD-40 and let them soak for awhile.  If this 
doesn't work, get a torch.  Heat the heck out of the screws, then quickly 
try to loosen them out.
If this completely fails, you will need to drill them.  Get a bit that 
matches them.  I think the stock screws are 3.5mm, but I could be wrong.  
Drill these out carefully because the glass lies right below this, and you 
don't want to run into that too far.  When you get the stuck screws drilled 
out, take a screw driver and put it under the the ledge in the channel 
perpendicularly.  Then, rock it back and forth.  This should break the 
&quot;stickiness&quot; the frame has with the inner seal and allow it to come loose.  
Don't try to take the frame apart until you have all four screws out, of 
course!
When you want to put the frames back together, you will need to retap the 
holes that you drilled out.  Find a friend with a tap set and rethread the 
holes to 4mm.  Then, order some 4mm screws from Wolfsburg West and your set.
If you have any questions on resealing the windows, feel free to ask.
Good luck,
-Wes
