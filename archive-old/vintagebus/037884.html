Subject: What in the web??  (was Article tracking Software)

	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Im a senior designer for a company here in my town.  I specialize in Cold
Fusion on NT.  Database relational web apps.  If people are interested in
something like this, i'd be happy to donate a site that'll perform this
function with the ability for people to insert their own articles, tech
tips, and where to find info.  Also, on that note...  I've been looking for
some sort of web project that is VW related other than tracking the progress
of my own vehicles.  Throw any suggestions my way if anyone has any.

Not the entire article, just the subject.  I have all these mags and
when I
ever something goes wrong on my dubbs I always think &quot;I know I've seen
an
article for this&quot;.  I would like to be able to go into a program and
type
&quot;Brakes&quot; and get all the article titles, mag name, year and month.  That
way
I can just go my library of mags and pull the right one.  Once I
actually
get all the articles indexed it should be pretty easy to keep up with
it.

You mean like a database of articles?
