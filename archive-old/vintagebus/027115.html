Subject: Vinyl Graphics; One more thing

The previous owner of my bus had put some vinyl graphics on the side of
the bus as decorations and an advertisement for his chiropractic
practice.
When I got the bus, the first thing I did when I got home was to peel
those things off.
I found that it took a lot of rubbing coumpound to remove the outline of
the stickers after they were peeled away. In some cases moisture had
been trapped behind them and some surface rust had formed.
