&gt;Ah yes, speaking of the understanding wife:  I currently own 3 running 
&gt;ACVW's.  66 Camper, 73 Westy, and 71 Super Beetle.

I want to keep it, so how do I explain the air-cooled phenomenon to my  wife 
when she asks, and i quote, &quot;Why do you need three...

Well, that's a tuff one.....  seams one more than needed..... I got it! SELL 
the bug!  Their at a premium, take the money and put it into the busses and 
you can't lose, ;&gt;) make some more parking space?!

Just fooling! Almost posted it to the list but I'll let you forward it if 
you think its relevant.
