In a message dated 98-11-25 02:00:59 EST, you write:

&lt;&lt; Since the paint on the undercarriage of my '67 Westy is all but gone, does
 anyone know how it should be painted? Mine is not -and won't be-
 undercoated. Is it primer, black, or body color? My bus is a factory
 European delivery 2-tone. I'm going to blast it and repaint.
  &gt;&gt;
Hi Kris,
Well VW used a high zinc content primer sprayed on the bus.  While the bug and
KG were fully dipped in high zinc content primer.  Which is one of the main
reasons that bus rockers and dog legs rust out so quickly compared to type 1
sheet metal.  In essence the zinc primer galvanizes the sheet metal and where
there is no primer rust rules.  Have been trying to figure if the bus had only
the zinc primer as the chassi paint or if there is a second coat of gray paint
to seal the underside even more, but have not found info detailing this.  Eric
