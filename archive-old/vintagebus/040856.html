During my 4 month honeymoon VW bus trip, I
didn't have a place to properly unload my
used oil, so I used the local Qwiki-Loob 
wherever I was.  I was a fun seeing people's
reactions in different places around the country.
I always provided them the tools, spread out
my floor mat, lay on the ground behind the
bus and gave them step by step directions.

The most fun was in Detroit with a kid who had
never seen a VW before.  He was thoroughly
impressed with the independent suspension.
