 OTOH, I've never been able to set points with a feeler gauge and have
 the dwell (which is what is important here!) be in the correct range. 
 I do set the points using a feeler gauge, but invariably have to reset
 the points with a dwell meter (a minor hassle) to get the dwell right. 
 This _must_ be done before setting the timing, as the points setting
 affects the timing.  Too bad that Bosch couldn't have followed Delco's
 lead and made the points adjustable by turning a screw, rather than the
 silly pry-the-points-around approach.

if you get the old distributors, like I think an 010 or the kind that came in 
my 53 standard (383?), the points adjust by turning a screw.  Which, as you 
say, is nicer.    I like the old mechanical advance distributors too, nice 
advance curve.  Just is harder to find points, so I get a bunch when I can.
