Hi Michael,
That is why we never suggest those for removing rusted/frozen threaded 
fasteners!  Only drilling out the screw itself works, if it can not be 
convinced to come out with a screwdriver, and/or center punch, and round 
punch.
 
&lt;&lt;Question: How do the frames come apart? Do you slide them apart like a sash 
window?  &gt;&gt;
Yes, much like taking apart the side pop out windows of a bus.
