Hi James,
Sounds most likely you need to go through all of the shift linkage and 
replace at least the front linkage bushing.  Do slide under your bus and have 
a friend work the shifter up front while you inspect the rear shifter coupler 
for any flexing or loose bolts that should have been safety wired tight, that 
might be reducing the twist of the linkage going into the tranny.  Whenever 
you take out both the engine and tranny for the first time make sure to 
replace both rear shift linkage bushings and both dust boots on the ends of 
the protective tube.  Cleaning out all old grease and slathering in the new.  
All of these bushings and dust boots are availible through Wolfsburg West.
