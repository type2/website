Speaking of weird looks, and feeling kinda dumb, there was a really nice
split waiting for the light to change as I was driving through...(seconds,
really, so I didn't get the year)...I was driving Michele's red Toyota p/u
with white shell through Sebastopol, CA....I saw the van to my left, and
made rather obvious ogling, thumbs-up, smile cuz yer in a Vintage VW motions
to the three Volks in the front seat.....if that was any of you...my
compliments!
