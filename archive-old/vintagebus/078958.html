Subject: '67 Electrical

Went to start the ''67 this weekend, but starter does not seem to have enough
kick from the battery to turn over. Battery measures 12.54 volts, radio comes
on, lights, 4 way flasher, etc. Battery was bought in 1997 and stored, in
winter, kept up...

If I put my battery charger on 12V/10 amps after five minutes it will start,
although motor seems to struggle for 20 seconds to get all four cylinders
going.

Any ideas???

Looking at my ignition switch last week I discovered the screw connectors
(older switch I was using had backed off the connections somehow). Checked it
again and found a nice hole burnt/blown thru the back of the housing..... 6V
doing 12V duty maybe?

Anyway replaced it with another NOS '67 ignition switch I had on hand. Didn't
solve the problem though...

Any help appreciated. Thanks!

Scott
