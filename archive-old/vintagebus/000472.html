Subject: [VB] Dealer splitty brochure on Ebay
Message-ID: &lt;0.92ec34e.25585aa6_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

I put a excellent condition early 60's Splitty brochure on Ebay last night.  
Hoping to be able to judge the value of the others by the sale price of this 
one.  LIST MEMBERS GET A 10% DISCOUNT IF THEY ARE THE WINNING BIDDER.
