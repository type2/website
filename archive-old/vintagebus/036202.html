&lt;&lt; The standard 009 has 21 degrees of advance, I usually started at 7.5 BTDC
 with 'em, at least until I found a real dizzy...
 
That makes a total of 28.5 degrees; doesn't Veewee say total advance of about 
30?  Also, here at altitude, (Albuquerque) we start about 10 degrees or more.

 &lt;something new soon?&gt;

Holding out on us Everett?  New baby? barndoor? cmon, we're all your 
friends....
