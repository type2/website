Well, I found a set of singlecab gates.
Complete with latches, hardware.
They are pretty straight, some dents. Sides appear to be a little bit bowed 
out.
Not bad though.
Better than 75% of the ones I see floating around for sale.
The seller wants 750$ bucks though, is this a going price?
I dont know, I always sell stuff too cheap and pay too much, so I'm not 
exactly a good judge as far as pricing.
If anyone has any ideas on what I should have to pay for a decent set of 
singlecab gates, let me know.
I must be dreaming, I figured I could pick up a decent set at like 300$ or so.
Thanks-
Greg
