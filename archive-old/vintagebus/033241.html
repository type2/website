&lt;&lt; I thought the rear hatch screen wasn't fitted until the '68 models.  Am I 
wrong?&gt;&gt;
Hi Kabayo,
They were a dealer accessory for any large rear hatch 1964ish to 1979 bus.
 
&lt;&lt;Do I need one for my '66?  There are no fastening points on my bus for the 
screen, as far as I know.&gt;&gt;
It depends...  Do you camp in your bus and does the weather where you camp 
get too hot and/or too many mosikitos?  If so then yes it is a really nice 
addition to any bus.  Dawn of PLF made us one for our 1960 panel with it's 
small hatch and set it up to install with velcro tape so we did not have to 
drill holes for the screw/snaps on the inside of the hatch opening.
  On our return trip from Sacramento this spring we passed out at a rest area 
with outside temps in the mid 80s.  Was able to install the screen for the 
first time in about five minutes and enjoy a breeze through our bus.  Which 
made napping an easy occurance.
Thinking of making a screen to go over one or both cargo door openings and 
attaching with magnets....      Eric&amp;Barb
