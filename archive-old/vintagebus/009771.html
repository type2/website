We were just talking about this whole set up with gauges up in the overhead
unit or over where the sun visor sits. It all depends if you'll ever want to
go to the shows for prizes or just want to drive your bus. I won't even
worry about this stuff because I will go with custom resto without sticking
tightly to all this NOS stuff. Look up the archives and look for gauges in
the overhead unit. I think this was the subject.
Good luck!

('63 Standard - Magic)

&gt; Hello again...
&gt;
&gt; I am trying to visualize my '67 when it's all done and happening....and
one
&gt; of the details is the fact that I consider oil temp. and pressure gauges,
&gt; and a head temp. gauge to be important when driving air-cooled vehicles on
&gt; long trips.  (I've learned a lot about things from the oil and head temp.
&gt; gauges on my air-cooled Vanagon).
&gt;
&gt; I think I can fit all three gauges in the hole where the radio would
&gt; go...yes, I would construct a tasteful, and removable panel for them, and
&gt; maybe some kind of hood that matches the rest of the dash.  The stereo
&gt; components would be underneath the dash or behind/under the seat.
&gt; BTW.._dot_can you tell me what that hole under the front seat is intended for
&gt; (if not for the jack, handle, and wrench), and whether it is supposed to
&gt; have a cover?
&gt;
&gt; Any thoughts or suggestions re: gauge placement?
&gt;
