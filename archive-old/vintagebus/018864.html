So then it would be safe to assume that a Kombi would fall under, which
class?  I guess it's a commercial bus, afterall it has the black vent
latches.  But it was destined as a passenger bus on it's way to the
Westfalia factory to get dressed up.  ???

All I know is my Westy had all Sigla glass and *on top* front slider
latches as there were no signs of any of these things being changed by a
P.O.

&gt; THat passenger vs commercial distinction makes a lot of sense.   I 
&gt; thought 
&gt; that 61-63 buses all came with the laminated/sigla glass. But then I 
&gt; heard of 
&gt; and saw earlier buses with sigla, but come to think of it they were 
&gt; pass 
&gt; buses or campers.   56 deluxe has large logo SEKURIT.  60 DD panel 
&gt; had 
&gt; sekurit, 60 truck sekurit, 59 panel had sekurit, 59 truck sekurit, 
&gt; 58 DD had 
&gt; sekurit- most of the late 50s buses I have had were commercials.   
&gt; 61 deluxe 
&gt; has sigla, 61 standard sigla

&gt;  Between 62-65 the laws became less strict.
&gt;  Laminated (sigla) glass you cannot drill through without cracking.

&gt;  &lt;&lt; I don't think it's a &quot;later&quot; thing, I think it's just a glass 
&gt; option 
&gt; thing.
&gt;   My '55 had thru-the-glass window, but my '56 had &quot;on top&quot; latches. 
&gt;  What
&gt;  does this mean?  It means that you could use thru the glass stuff, 
&gt; save
&gt;  your sanity, and would not have to worry about being incorrect.  
&gt;  
&gt;  I remember someone saying those funky windows came about because of 
&gt; not
&gt;  being able to drill that type of glass. &gt;&gt;
