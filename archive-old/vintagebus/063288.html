&gt;we look it over and see no sign of anything burnt ,so we throw a fresh 
&gt;battery in it and it wont turn over when you hit the ignition, no click,
&gt;nothing. The volt-o-meter says 8volts from the power to the coil.

12 volt battery, right?  8 volts at the coil is no good.  Measure the
voltage at the battery with everything shut off and you should have
12.6 volts.  If not, your battery isn't fully charged.  Then turn the
ignition key on and measure the voltage at the second-from-the-right
fuse.  If it's 12 volts or over, good.  If not, take out the fuse and
try again.  If it's 12 volts or over now, then you have a problem in
the brake lights, turn signal/hazards, or wiper.

If you got 12 volts or over with the fuse in, or if the voltage stayed
low with the fuse out, go to the back of the car.  Unplug the power
wire from the coil and put the voltmeter to it.  If you get 12 volts
or over, there's something wrong in the coil, points, or condenser.
If it's less than 12 volts, there is a problem in the ignition switch,
or in the wiring from the switch to the coil.

Good luck!
