Hi,

First, thanks to Harry and Karl from Fresno for lending me a
deep socket wrench to remove a gas tank from that 71 loaf at
Ecology in Wilmington. See you at OCTO.

All you guys in AZ, is there anyone with a spare passenger
door to fit a 64. I need one with the flip out handle. I
have been told that 61 through early 64 will fit and had
this handle.
Are there any good wrecker yards around Phoenix that may
have one? Phone number?

Thanks,
Chris.
