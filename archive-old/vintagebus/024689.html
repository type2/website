Subject: NEWFOUNDLAND

To the folks off to newfoundland - have you considered going to
Saint-Pierre and Miquelon while you are in newfoundland - ive always
wanted to get there myself and im considering a trip there in the summer
- you catch the ferry from Fortune, NFLD and of course as it is part of
france you'll need a passport -
http://209.205.50.254/encyspmweb/english.html - considering the age of
the place and the history and the cost of traveling to and from
newfoundland - i bet you could pay for your trip easily with a few stops
at well chosen antique shops :)
