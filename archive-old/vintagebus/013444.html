&gt; Does anyone know anything about swamp coolers. (They use water and a
&gt; fan blows over it)
&gt; Can you make a version of that for a Volkswagen bus?
&gt; They are much better than air conditioners for they don't take much
&gt; electricity.
&gt; I will probably never check this message again, so please e-mail me

 You wacky guy!

Our hero is making his own

I have four 12 volt muffin fans stacked vertically and they will be duct
taped go in the pop out gap behind the drivers door. The window opening
will be covered with swamp cooler material and hosed down with a super
shooter pump type squirt gun with a vacuum line attached to the nozzle.
The gun will be attached to the steering column with hose clamps.

For a less juvenile approach, look at the JC Whitney catalog. They have
evaporative coolers for sale. Also note that they don't work in climates
with high humidity.

Aloha
Ken
