Hi Volks,

I have been scratching my head all break trying to figure out why Sparky
won't idle.  First of all, the engine is a single port 1600, # AE with a
009.  When Sparky is cold, he starts right up and idles at 900 RPM and is
timed at 7.5 ATD (still trying to figure out best place!). When he warms
up, he stalls.  He will start right up again but it seems the is not enough
gas getting to the engine.  I tried to adjust the air fuel mixture but
nothing seems to happen.  What do you all think?  Thanks in advance.

Joy thru air,

Jamie
