Hi,
The problem you're running into sounds exactly like what I had to deal with
earlier this year.
I also checked plugs, wires, points, condensor, coil, and all the wiring
connections throughout the whole bus.
What I ran into was (and this sounds too simple) a clogged fuel filter, which
led to the main carb jets clogging also.
You might want to pull the carb apart and check it out and clean it
thouroughly.
Replace your gas lines, possibly check your filter inside the gas tank.
Fuel pump could be going bad under a load also. If possible pull off the fuel
pump top and check the diaphragm inside for pinholes. If there are then it
needs to be replaced.
Good luck
