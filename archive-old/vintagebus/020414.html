 Nope ! Money is no good in Canada...hahahaha...I
think you mean AAA..Well I have been to Canada,what a
great place.But never had any trouble.Point is....I
love that bus in the driveway...But...If I had the
$$$$ you would see me travel in a Cobra with a 427 and
a plastic card and nothing else buying clothes and a
new tooth brush at each new 5 star hotel
everynight....Hope this day dream does not get me
kicked off the list cause this poor boy will never see
those Cobra days...But I did talk to and see Shelbys
Cobras last year at Laguna Seca....Mark 67 Deluxe
