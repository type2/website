&gt; The top speed of a T2 is what ever you get with WOT.

&gt; The air intake is a restriction and limits the amount of air

&gt; VWs are made to run at WOT all day.

&gt; If you are overheating on a good engine, try uping your fuel

I actually wrote a big long response to the original post, but it got
lost in the ether and I switched back to netscape from outlook...

But instead of higer octane, why not be certain that your combustion
chamber compression ratio is set to a modest level. Too many rebuilt
heads slapped on without a thought to cc'ing turn into gawd-awful high
ratios, meaning you have to run the spendy juice or pre-ignite. 
I run around 7.2:1 ratios and can run the cheep stuff, even in the third
world and still run pretty cool.

I agree that running all-out on a hot day will help to overheat you, and
slowing down when all other variables are working against your cooling
ability will save your bacon.  But I think that with the later &quot;big nut&quot;
tranny like on my 65, top speed for cruising is something closer to 65
than 57.  I have gone all day in hot weather when on flats at 60-65 and
not overheated. Thats with a non-doghouse dp1600. Hell, I have even
pushed it to 70-75 for short spurts....

I have more than 12  3000+ mile trips with this bus under my belt, one
over 8000.... and nearly 70k on this engine... so I must not be doing
everything wrong...
