Subject: Top Speed

Merry Christmas Everyone!

 

I have a 65 Bus that I am working on.  Have quite a bit of work to do before
I am road worthy.  I was reading that the top speed of the bus is 60 miles
and hour?  Is this correct with a 1600 engine?  I need to rebuild the engine
- any suggested sources of information for a very visual person?
