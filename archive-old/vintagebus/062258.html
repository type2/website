Subject: RE: [VB] Transport companies

Andre you may be better off with a different transporter rather than sinking
additional cash into these dudes.  I had good luck with a company in Tempe
AZ. Advantage Auto Transport, 1-800-233-4875.  They picked up my bus in Utah
and shipped to MA for $950.  Good luck

Hi Andre,
Hate to say it . . .but it looks like you should pay the $200 extra, and
write it off to experience.  If the guy you bought the bus from needs to get
it off his property - you don't really have a choice.

Also sounds like you'll spend more than the extra $200 in phone calls, lost
time at work, worry, etc, etc, etc.

You don't really have much of a choice.
