Ok, Volks, I've pulled the engine and tranny back out, positioned the
tranny with the nosecone up in the air (so as not to leak gear oil all
over my workspace) and removed the nosecone cover.

I can see plainly how the shifter works now. The &quot;hockey stick&quot; moves
back and forth between 3 forks, and moves the forks in and out to select
the gears. Pretty simple. 

I'm supposing that when the tranny is in neutral, the slots in the forks
should all line up... Right?

What I found when I removed the cover was a lot of rusty muck, and the
top fork was pushed into the tranny. The lower 2 forks were out. Is this
reverse? I was figuring that reverse would be out, rather than in, but I
haven't looked at how the front of the linkage works yet...

I've soaked the forks down with WD-40 and worked them in and out a bit
to loosen them up. They were pretty stuck. I managed to loosen the top
fork so that it lines up with the other two (I'm using only gentle
persuasive moves, not banging or hard prying).

Also, I've found the numbers on this puppy. 113 301 103 is cast into the
case. I'm thinking that this is a part number, but shouldn't it start
with a &quot;2&quot; for type 2? The other number, H8848023 is stamped into the
case. I'm guessing that is the serial number for this tranny. Can anyone
tell me anything from these numbers? BTW, this is a big nut tranny,
without backup light switch, and appears to have been cut for 12V.

If I get this tranny going, I'm going to clean it up, paint it, and name
it &quot;Lazarus&quot;.
