&gt; What started out as a simple replacement of
&gt; the pilot bearing in my 1970 bus has turned 
&gt; into my choice of
&gt; 
&gt; a) engine rebuild
&gt; b) new engine
&gt; 
&gt; This is due to the discovery of two significant 
&gt; cracks in the engine block and a bad crankshaft 
&gt; bearing. I have not torn it down, but I am willing
&gt; to bet that it needs a total rebuild. 
&gt; 
&gt; I am leaning toward option b, Mexican longblock, 
&gt; ala Ronnie.
&gt; 
&gt; The question is, how well will the engine tin and
&gt; other components fit? My dead engine is a 1600 SP 
&gt; with the non-doghouse oil cooler. The new longblock 
&gt; is a 1600 DP with doghouse oil cooler.

OK, if you decide to go with the Mexican engine (I'm happy with mine) you
will need:

oil cooler adapter
Doghouse fan shroud
wider doghouse fan
front (FIF) tin with hole for doghouse outlet
Two pieces of ductwork for doghouse outlet.
Hoover bit that goes on oil cooler
cylinder tins
manifold ends for dual port
manifold center section for dual port
Carburator adapter to adapt 30 carb to 34 manifold (unless you can
scrounge up a rare 30mm center section)

The hard parts to find are the front tin, which was a '71-bus-only part,
and the manifold center section which has a fitting for the brake booster.
Both of these can be made from bug parts in a pinch.

The best way to go is to find a complete set of tin on a junker.  Check
the tin (particularly the cylinder tin) for cracks and braze them before
installation.  OEM tin is markedly better than the aftermarket stuff, and
the wrecker's price is usually a lot more reasonable.

I've probably forgotten a bit or two, but the conversion isn't all that
hard to accomplish.
