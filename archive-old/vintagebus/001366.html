Anyone seen the new VW commercial for the New Cabrio?  It shows 4 people (2
guys and 2 girls) cruising at night with the top down.   The moon, stars,
and bus are out and they seem to be enjoying themselves.  As they arrive at
the party location, they sit and a look at each other and then there is a
fade-out as the driver's side reverse light comes on.  It shows them out
cruising again - message being that they'd rather cruise then party.

The background music is a soft accoustic piece.  Anyone know the name or
author of it?
