The middle extra 2 tent brackets were on mid `61-`65
westys for the optional extra small baby tent...foyer
tent some call it.  These were 'only' on mid `61
thru`66 westys starting with the production od
SO-34-35 era...so don't fret if you have a early bus
and think your missing something as you are not

&gt; THat's for a west with two tents - you use one
&gt; bracket pair or the other,
&gt; not both at the same time.
&gt; 
&gt; The second set of brackets goes above the doors, for
&gt; the small tent.

&gt; &gt; There is a set of brackets on eBay right now (item
&gt; #324468860) showing 4 roof brackets.  I've never
&gt; seen 4 before.  Is this for a later (mid '60's)
&gt; setup, or am I missing something here?  Two brackets
&gt; is what you're missing, right!? hehehehe
