Anyone have any miracle fixes for warped and dirty door panels?
I hear Simple Green works good.......?
Get 'em wet and lay 'em flat?
Any ideas appreciated...

well, not a miracle, but yes if you carefully remove the trim (used on all 
passenger  microbus interior panels), scrub them with simple green , soak 
thoughroughly with a hose, lay on flat surface, cover with plywood, sit a 
toolbox, extra battery etc on top as a weight, and wait till dry, they will 
be flatter and cleaner.    

To keep them from warping again, while they are drying, take your door 
mechanisms out and clean and grease the workings.  They will give you joy of 
door opening and closing.   Reinstall.   Cut clear plastic to line the doors 
with, as water is designing to flow through them, and will splash against the 
panel if there is no lining. duct tape the cover  at the top and edges, cut a 
hole for the door handle stalk , tuck the bottom of the plastic into the 
bottom of the doors so water will drip that way rather than between the 
plastic and the door .   When you put the dry straight panel back on the door 
(install chrom etrim first of course) remember the foam thingy that goes 
around the handle stalk (or spring if you like) to space it out.  you must 
space it out.  or the panel wont press up against the escutchon for the inner 
door handle, and will look funny.
