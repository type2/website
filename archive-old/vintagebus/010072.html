	...
	1965 still had the highbeam switch on the floor.
	1966 began the 7-wire turn signal switch with the highbeam switch.
	Every 66 I have ever seen had the highbeam switch on the turn signal
switch.

I am not an avid bus historian, and my bus electrical experience is now at
1, but Wolfsburg West is showing a one year only (1965) 6 volt headlamp
relay in their catalog.  Where was this used?  It had to be a turn signal
dimmer, didn't it?
