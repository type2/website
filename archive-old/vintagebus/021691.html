FWIW, I did not sign the Bentley petition that urged Bentley to republish the 
59-62 version.   I wrote a letter to Bentley urging them to reprint the  &quot;55 
edition&quot;  covering buses 3/55 through 5/59- the 36hp splitcase tranny version.

the 59 edition is the only location of the information about the  difference 
between flat (early) and curved (late) fulcrum plates, and for that piece of 
info I am glad to have bought it.
 
if you have a bentley 1963 edition, does it have the little list near the 
front of the 4 editions of the transporter Workshop manual, and which buses 
they cover?   
53 (barndoor)
'55 (36hp/split trans post BD)
59 (5/59 through 62)
63 (63-67)

guess you didn't get a workshop manual till 53.  hm, wonder when they first 
made a beetle workshop manual

 &gt;
 &gt; The 1955 manual does not cover barndoors.  It covers March
 &gt; 1955-58, but the only change between them &amp; up to May 1959
 &gt; is the bumpers.  The 1952/53 manual covers barndoors &amp; I
 &gt; realize that is a much more limited market and not economically
 &gt; feasible to reprint.
