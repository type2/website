Is Anyone going to the solvang show from the San Francisco Bay Area.I wish i 
could go, but i have to work to pay for my expensive hobbies. if any of you 
are going, could you pick up a middle seat for me from jelm2_at_yahoo_dot_com? Id be 
willing to pay you  $50 for your effort.  . if you are willing to help 
another bus guy out let me know.
