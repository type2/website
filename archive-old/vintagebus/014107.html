I was looking in the Bentley Transporter manual and noticed
a difference in the pictured turn signal and what I've seen
on most buses.  The ones in the book look like a glass lens
with a chrome metal band around the outside, mounted to the body.

Can anyone shed light on this, or maybe tell me where I can find 
this?

Thanks.
Cecil
