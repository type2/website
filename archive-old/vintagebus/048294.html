Hi Kelly and Clara,
Thanks for the correction!  We have a 1959ish VW of Canada heater booster and 
winterizing catalog.  One of the items mentioned in it is a canvas system to 
cover the length of the BD belly area where the shifter without protective 
tubing runs.  Apparently without the canvas this unprotected shift rod all 
too often got stuck from freezing water and snow.    Eric&amp;Barb
