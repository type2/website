Subject: Jerome Jam 8

Have fliers to mail out. Email address and I will send ASAP. A few
changes this year. No overnight camping Thurs. The lot will be lined 
out Fri. AM so there will be room. Please no Circle the Wagons
campsites. Going to try and have VW's only in the main camping area.
All non vw's (unless needed in camp area for venders or whatever) will
be parked in seperate area by hill I think. This way pictures and area
will have almost all VW's, after all this is a VW event. Jerome is
getting crowded and this year will be a test for future events as far as
room goes. There are some different costs this year also. All of this
is in the flier. One great thing is that if you are in a VW club the
camping is only $5.00 per night, see flier for more details. I hope I
don't go broke on 32 cent stamps ( if that many request fliers),anyway
email your address and I will send fliers. 
John (See you in Jerome and LHC in 99) Howard
