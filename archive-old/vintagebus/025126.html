Hi all-

After getting
kicked off the
computer
tonight by the
wife, I was
thumbing
through her
recent May
issue of
Cosmopolitan to
see what
giberish she
has been
reading.   In
the swim suit
section
(honestly hon,
I wasn't
looking at the
girls.....) I
noticed a few
shots of a swim
suit beauty
modeling in and
next to a even
more beautiful
and sano 23
window.  The
florida plates
tell us its a
61 and its
orange and
white.   Who is
the lucky guy
to own this
babe (bus)??!!

Gerald
