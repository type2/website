John is right. The AE case, all things being equal, is a far superior case. It
has larger oil passages, dual pressure relief valves, and is made of a better
allow of magnesium than the H case. Since you're not building a stock engine,
count your blessings and carry on. 

You wouldn't, in my opinion, want to build an H case up as you have described.
The H case was designed for the smaller oil cooler, and even though the
doghouse cooler can be retrofitted to the H case, you'll never get the full
benefit because your oil passages in the case are smaller.

BTW, the AE case was intended for dual-port heads. I don't think it makes any
difference to the case, but I would consider going back to DP heads. I
*believe*, but do not know for sure, that they will give you better power and
better cooling of the heads (equalling longer life).

I'd stick with the AE case you have rather than find an H case, unless you are
doing a resto on the beast.   because 1)  you have it, 
2)  bigger oil passages
3)better alloy
4) dual oil relief, as has been said

But I must say that I have happily driven around in H cases for years.  Well,
I wasn't in the H case itself, I was in the car the H case was in.  Ya.  okay.

But keep it SP.   SP heads are sturdier.   Dual port heads are notorious for
cracking.  A little bit more power, but not worth it.
