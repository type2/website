I believe the holes were on later trucks. Go to www.dropgates_dot_com for details. 
Was it bay trucks only? I guess you could do battle with the dept. of motor 
vehicles and get a third license plate to mount on the inside of the gate. 




To anticipate your next question... No, that's not an ashtray on the passenger 
side of the rear gate, it's a step when the gate is down. ;-)

&gt; I just picked up a '64 SInglecab  My rear
&gt; gate, which might not be original has 2 factory installed holes which 
&gt; line up with the taillights when the gate is down.
