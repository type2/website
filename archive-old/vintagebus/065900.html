Subject: RE: [VB] Rabbit Resevoir???

I am not sure what the difference between the 68-71 MC and the 72-79 MC is.
I had a power brake MC on my 71 westfailure and would sure love to have
something like that on my 67 SC. Oh yeah, I have power brakes now, it just
matters on how hard I push the pedal!

Hey Dave,
when I upgraded my 67 dual circuit to a 72-79 bus MC I used the 79 Rabbit
reservoir with the original rubber reservoir seals from the 67 MC. I dabbed
some brake fluid in the seals and on the reservoir nipples  and firmly
pressed it into the MC with a little side to side rocking. It went down all
the way, but was real firm!




I went to my local breakers today and got a 68 master cylinder. I am
thinking of fitting 72-79 brakes. Should I have gone for a later IE servo
master cylinder. Your thoughts Please Mel
