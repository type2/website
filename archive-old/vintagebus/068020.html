 I mean, is it possible that VW created a one

mechanism fits it?

That's what I'm thinking, especially since it was old
stock from Thailand, though definitely made in Germany
by VW. I'm gonna go out later and match it up to the
door on my '67 and see if I can spot any differences.

Does anyone know of other differences in the
early/latre doors (other than 2 holes for the inside
pull handle. I've also heard the holes for the door
panel clips are larger?)
