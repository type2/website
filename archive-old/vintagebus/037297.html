&gt; I should add it takes a big hammer of the sledge variety.   I first tried

what
&gt; a air impact is doing, but of course with much small deflection potential
(
&gt; I imagine someone will now mention the potential for a bent stub or
&gt; something.  :)

Of course they will say that. And they could be right but I have found it
not to be true. Keep that tire down on the ground during this of course! I
have used what my friends and I call the &quot;big tool&quot; many times. In fact,I
dont think I  have even tried a cheater or any other method, just that
keyhole looking tool. Take my sledge to it and hammer down. On 67, 63, 70,
71, 73, you name it, it breaks it! The hold of that nut that is.....
There will be those who say the bearings are in jeopardy, but I have never
seen that happen, and if it did, I am in the position to replace them,
whereas I wasnt before.
