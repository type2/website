Woody,

From '58 (or when ever they went away from the pressed ones) to '65 (some
say '64) both the front and rear had ends that were slashed (matched the
profile of the wheel openings).  In '66 both bumpers ends were changed to
more of a point.  The trim would have matched those profiles...ie:
Pointed bumpers got pointed trim and slashed bumpers got slashed ends.
There is a length difference also between the euro and American bumpers.
The euro ones being longer to span the distance left by the absence of
the overiders.

&gt; How does the trim differ between the two ? slash or pointed that is.?
&gt;
&gt; , slash ends or pointed and which bumper they go with (front or rear).
