I drive a 59 euro single cab, it had the original headlight switch in it, 
which broke and was replaced with one that absolutely came out of an American 
spec bus.  With either switch the parking lights stay on with the headlights. 
 The wiring harness was brand new when I redid the bus and it is wired per 
the correct wiring diagram.
