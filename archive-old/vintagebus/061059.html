&gt; In a head nut re-torque scenario, would a stud loose at the case

No, you'll still get the same friction between the threads, either at the
head (most likely, due to the number of threads in bearing) or at the
case.

&gt; Hence, to coin a phrase, a &quot;floater&quot; stud that
&gt; torques to spec cold, but when stressed by normal operating temps.
&gt; and loads, goes out of spec due to loosing at the case end of the
&gt; stud?

If it loosens, it will probably do so at the nut end.  the lower nuts are
lubricated by engine oil, while the case inserts are not.

&gt; Maybe a dab of blue loctite would help? I hear that red loctite
&gt; is permanent and you would have been SOL with your broken stud,
&gt; George.

Even blue would have left me stranded.  If loctite were so good, the
factory would have used it.  They chose not to for a very good reason, so
that the parts could be disassembled later on without undue difficulty.

If something is so critical that loctite is considered, then it is better
to safety-wire the nut or bolt head.  Safety wire doesn't loosen and the
fastener can still be easily removed.
