Subject: Found 23 window...need advice

Well, split-window busses are VERY rare in my neck of the woods. While
going to look at a 21 window rolling shell that a guy had for sell, I saw a
mid-60's 23 window walk-thru sunroof deluxe in his barn. Here's what I can
remember about it

-80% of the glass was there &amp; in good shape. There were a few skylights
missing &amp; a couple of pop outs missing.
-The nose had some damage, but it looked like it could be banged out.
-The cab &amp; cargo floor were in good shape. minor rust
-sunroof hardware is there, no cloth
-no seats in at all
-half of the interior panels gone, other half needs work
-jail bars are there
-body in good shape, some surface rust, some dents
-cargo &amp; cab doors in acceptable shape
-wiring intact. most headlights, blinkers, tailights there.
-headliner needs replacing.

and the big ones

-No transaxle (rear end) or engine.

The bus needs a lot of work, but like I said, not too many splitties at all
around hear... &amp; it's a 23 window!!!

I chatted with the guy for a long time. He said he hadn't planned on
selling it. But I pretty much talked him into it by letting him know it
would be going to a good home. He threw the price of $1000 at me. I don't
have the $$$ right now, so I didn't negotiate. He told me to save my $$$ &amp;
come back, it'd still be there, &amp; he'd sell it to me.

Finally my questions.

What is a fair price for this beast. I realize it's worth whatever I will
pay for it, but it's hard to be subjective when I've already fell in love.
Just wanted some other opinions thrown my way.

Also, I'm more than positive I will have a hard time finding a bus
transaxle for it. But to get it home, I'll probably have to put one in.
Right now it's up on blocks in the back.  What problems would I have
putting a bug transaxle rear-end in it. I've searched the archives &amp; found
that I'll have to switch the R&amp;P so I don't end up with 4 reverses. After
that, I'm unclear if the rear end is going to be the proper width.  I'm
fairly new with this subject, &amp; I may be getting confused with putting an
IRS rear end in.

I also have access to a few '68-'71 vans as well. Would using one of those
tranny's be better, or would it work at all?

Any info would be greatly appreciated.

p.s. The reason why I'm asking is that bugs are EVERYWHERE around here.
