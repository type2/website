Hi,

I have never had any experience with torsion bars. Rumour has it you can
 &quot;crank them up&quot; to compensate for sagging. Has anyone done this? My 62
westy sits a bit lower on the drivers side rear and in the rear in general.
Since it is my first split and I don't see many others it is hard to decide
what is normal.

Bob
