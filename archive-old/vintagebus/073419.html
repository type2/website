&gt; Check out page 69** of the Eberspaecher BN4/BA6 manuals Thom has up at

&gt; put out 15,900 BTU/hr max, while using 0.20 to 0.65 liters/hr (0.42 to
&gt; 1.4 US pints/hr) of fuel and 50 W (4 A) of electricity.

just to add to this. I'm not sure if Eberspaecher gives it's fuel
usage the same way as the stewart-warner heaters, but...one of the SW
manuals I read gave a usage per hour. It also noted that this was
burning full time, and gave a number around actual burn time was 30%
IIRC. So the actual fuel usage should be less. EB might have rated
their heaters the same way.

Since running my SW I have noticed a 1-2 mpg dip in milage. But who
cares, I'm warm!
