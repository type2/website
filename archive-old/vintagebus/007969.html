&gt; Think she means the covered 1955 only manifold that had welded on cover
&gt; tubing over/around the vertical part of the intake manifold just below the
&gt; carb.  This cover allowed hot exhaust gases to circulate around this part
of
&gt; the manifold to prevent icing.  This type of manifold all too soon rusted
out
&gt; and allowed exhaust gasses into the manifold and back into the engine.  So
&gt; not many remain to be seen today.  Eric&amp;Barb

Ok, I figured out what you meant, it's pictured in my '54 Manual copy.  My
'55 owner's manual must not be a '55, the date page is missing but a PO
wrote their engine # in the manual (Nov. '55 engine #) so I figured it was a
'55 manual.  Woops!

Guess this means I need one of those for my '55 engine, I'm surprised it was
replaced in the CA climate.  Anybody?
