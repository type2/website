Hi Greg,
Your fuel filter is installed backwards so as to allow less filter surface 
for the crud to be filtered by.  Fuel line looks a bit frayed at the ends!  
Are there any signs of cracking of the rubber ends there?  Best to replace 
all rubber fuel lines if you do not know when they were last replaced and 
replace ever two to three years.  You really do not need the one way fuel 
valve before and after the fuel pump so go ahead and remove it.  Lower pulley 
is too small, get a stock &quot;D&quot; stamped pulley.  Wierd to see the post-1963 air 
cleaner hanging bracket on the left side of the engine!  BTW where is the air 
cleaner itself???!!  The black paper covered fresh air tubes are alot 
sturdier, but the all aluminum ones should work for now.  The green wire from 
the distributor to the coil is a mess!!  Take a pencil and wrap this wire 
around it, then slide out the pencil.  This will curl/spiral this wire and 
remove the sloppy loose extra wire out of the way.
