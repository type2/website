Subject: Finding Leaks

I've suspected that I had a leak or two somewhere in the back of my '67 
Freedom Camper for a month or so now, but had no real evidence as to where 
they might be.

Well tonight on my way home from work, I decided to take Lily to get a 
much needed BATH after driving on salty roads for the last month.

Guess what's really good for finding leaks: car washes!

This may have been evident to everyone but me, however, I found it amusing 
enough to post on.
