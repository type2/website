Hi John,
We would first retorque that head!  If the leak persists you can mount a 
spring loaded or threaded aftermarket push rod tube.  Or you can like we did 
by flatening the center of a stocker push rod tube and bending it just enough 
to get it and the end seals into place after removing the rocker and that 
push rod for that tube.  It took us only the second try to get the stocker 
tube in place and use a socket wrench handle to pop the tube from the inside 
into a round shape again!  Never leaked over many thousand of miles, and 
avoided having to wait for aftermarket parts.     Eric&amp;Barb
