&gt; That's a common problem.  I just went thru this last weekend, luckily vice
&gt; grips worked for me.  I've seen everything from liquid wrench to torches to
&gt; cutting to get these things off.
&gt;

I've fixed this several different ways...

I've used a cut-off tool (whizzer wheel) to cut the bushing/tube lengthwise then
use a cold chisel to cut the last bit and pry it off.

Another time I liberally doused the stud and bushing with PB Blaster for 2-3
days.  Works great if you have the time...

I've also applied heat from a propane torch for 10 minutes.  After bushing is
nice and hot, douse with cold water.  Repeat this (heat, then rapidly cool) a
couple times. This usually breaks the rust.   Finally heat a bit then use the
vice grips to &quot;unscrew&quot; the bushing off.

    Hope at least one method works for you...
