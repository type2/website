Subject: Westy_dot_dealer camper interior

   OK all you Westy Geru's out there, can anybody explain the difference
between a SO 34 interior and the dealer option Mosaic kit??  I have looked
at 2 Westy's with the SO 34 interior and it looks the same as the Mosaic I
have in my 15 window Deluxe. I cannot see any difference between the 2. Did
the Mosaic come from Westfalia for a dealer install?

ronnie   just wondering
