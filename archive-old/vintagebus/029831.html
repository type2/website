&gt; &gt; Anybody know if Manson had a bus?
&gt; 
&gt; didn't he have a beetle?  '68 or something?  am i confusing reality with the fiction &quot;still life with volkswagens?&quot;  perhaps i have manson confused with some other vw driving wacko?  you know, i get pretty strange after driving long distances in my truck - no radio makes rachel get weird... bark, bark!

One VW wacko to another: you're thinking of Ted Bundy, the guy who came
through here about 20 years ago, bludgeoning and biting sorority
sisters.  Pretty scary time here (Tallahassee FL).  My ex swears he came
to the door of her apartment one night.  Drove a yellow post-68 Beetle.
