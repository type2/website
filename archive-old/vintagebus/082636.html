Gene,

A number of things could make the engine feel more choked:

	- different compression ratio
	- different cylinder compressions (i.e. ring, valve, etc. issues)
	- etc.

If you haven't already, you might need to readjust the air/fuel mixture on 
the carb because of some of these issues.

As for dizzy exhaust issues, I haven't played around much with different 
exhaust systems (at least not where that was the only variable).  I do 
know that my vacuum advance dizzy seems to give me a smoother advance 
curve than the 009.  It might also feel somewhat constrained too 
accelerating on the flats, but it seems to do better keeping the bus 
moving under load and on the hills, etc, where the 009 seems to fall 
short.

As usual, YMMV.

hope this helps.
