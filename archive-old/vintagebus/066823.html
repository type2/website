Subject: [VB] Re: Times they are a changeing

Splitnosers,

  Van Bondo, where'd all that come from?  Dr. Gonzo would be proud of you!
Then again...Pat Robertson may have some issues, and if you start watching
the 700 club to keep up with his paranoia you'll be one of the few who can
carry on a good discourse with his flock.

  Ronnie, if you said all your customers are homebrew store owners, I'd
would think...and that is the way it should be, cause all my customers are
Pro (fessers) and Con (putters).

  I'd like to see entrepreneur take maybe 10 different busses (Deluxes,
Kombi, Campers, High Roof, Panel and some Special Models) and something
like Kyle's Westfailure and make a train out of them and have good snacks.
Have advanced reservations for a 3 month tour of the US, allow other
Vintage Bus owners to join in, get the complete experiance of touring in a
VB.  Kinda like the Mobile Museum, but better.  I'd do it, but I already
got a job.

Best,
joe
