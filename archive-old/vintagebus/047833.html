In a message dated 98-08-13 02:07:02 EDT, you write:
&lt;&lt;After removing the engine on the 67 to fix a broken exhaust stud, I decided
to move the battery to the left side of the compartment, where it could rest
on metal, instead of the plywood it was on. &gt;&gt;
You really should get the battery pan replaced so the engine will not be
sucking it's own cooling exaust air back in, which will cause engine
overheating.  Also having the battery strapped down system helps keep the
battery from moving around and breaking the tail light electrical tabs off.
&lt;&lt; The added length of wire to the regulator shouldn't be a problem.  Am I
right?&gt;&gt;
It should make vey little differnce if you have the rest of the wiring system
working right.
 &lt;&lt;Someone ran a wire from the mounting tab of the regulator to the negative
battery terminal.  Is this stock, or added insurance against lousy grounds? &gt;&gt;
Sounds like that is the reason for having that extra cable.  You should check
that your tranny ground strap is in place.
