Hey all,

I have the opportunity to purchase a 79 Westy in very good condition.
However, the only drawback I can see is the automatic transmission.  Has
anyone have kind words of wisdom about this?  The engine is a 2.0 and appears
to run well, it is a bit out of time but no worries there.  I am just
fascinated with how well this camper has been maintained and would be willing
to purchase it for that reason alone.  Asking price is $1800.   
How difficult would it be to find and install a standard transmission, or is
this not necessary?   Thanks for any and all input
 
penniless yet passionate
