&lt;&lt; How would one 'label' a true '54 Binz from
 one that ronnie crafted from a '54? &gt;&gt;

Binz are a coachbuilt (like the Hebmeuller)  The Ronnie built BarnBinzCrew 
(Barnz?) would be a custom or a reproduction...unless he goes into production 
making several of them in which case it would become a coachbuilt.
