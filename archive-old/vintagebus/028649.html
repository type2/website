Subject: Saving my Westy - long

To all,
I am in hope of getting to final paint late this week. Restoring this
vehicle has been a 3 year project. When I got it in 97 it had not moved
under it's own power since 1972. The entire vehicle was as complete as I
could have hoped for. The odometer shows about 45000 miles and it is
likely accurate. Even though it passed through 2 owners between myself
and the OG it was never worked on. That makes me Driver #2.
New tires, brake cylinders, and lines were the first step. This was
followed by a rebuilt motor, and fluid changes all around(several times
to be sure). After removing the camper interior and cleaning up the tons
of animal residue it was finally road worthy but ugly. The torsion arms
on the front axle were rusted solid. There was no movement in them at
all. When I drove down the road the only suspension I had was the tire
bounce. I fixed that and installed new shocks to boot. Rides much better
8) A check of the sheet metal needed to restore it made me wince. Thanks
to Ronnie F. I was able to get nearly all my sheet metal produced by a
quality source. It took nearly a year to gather enough spare cash to buy
the metal but with the help of several locals I removed the old and
installed the new metal in just a couple of weekends and several
evenings. Well, it was more like several weekends and a lot of evenings.
That work was completed last fall. I had to store it for the winter
months and was unable to complete the bodywork until now.
All of the original wood panels were present, but badly warped and
stained, so I have templates to work from. I scored some 5x5 Baltic
Birch panels so that should look great. Next come the TMI seatcovers for
the bucket seats. Can you sense a feeling of urgency in my voice? So
much work. So little time.
My plan is to debut it at the Omaha VW Club Show and shine on July 15th
in Omaha. Last year I won the trophy for Ugliest Vehicle. A badge I
deserved and wear proudly. NQ can tell you how much needed to be done at
the time. I hope that I will able to do the re-assembly by then for full
effect but it will be at least the shiniest in the show.
I hope that some of you will be able to make it to the show. Not much
swap action for buses so if you got parts it might be good to come on
by. We could also use a few more buses at the show.
Hey Ronnie, when are you making the Iowa run for the double cab? Any
plans yet?
I will post links to my pics soon so you can see how far it has come.
This list has been invaluable both in content and support. I lurk far
more than I write but I am always willing to help.
