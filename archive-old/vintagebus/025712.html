Your best bet in attending Jerome Jamboree Sept 11 &amp; 12th in Jerome,
Arid-zona--is to fly into Phoenix a day or so earlier, Wed. or Thur. of
that week.--As usual the Arizona Bus Club Caravan will leave from
Phoenix --around 7AM from Home Depot at Thunderbird and I-17 on
Sat-Morn, Sept. 11th.
--There will be lots of room for VW people to hitch a ride to Jerome--In
fact if Bessie, my 67 Grateful Dead bus that will be completed by then,
Right Ronnie?? May be in need perhaps of a driver? If not there will
always be friendly VW Volk to take you up and back to Jerome---uncle
