Well I wnt back out and was looking thru the oil that i drained and WOW! A 
big honking chunck of what looks like a gear tooth!!  So im bumming now.  
Might have to put th small nut tunnel in for a few days just to get around.  
Anyways, looking for some feedback from those who have had trannies built by 
Rancho.  Im running a completely balanced 1600 sp and am looking for a STOCK 
trans.  Anyone have any sugestions as to whether or not to upgrade to the 
3.88?  I really would like to stay stock but if it's going to cause any extra 
problems as far as life span I will gladly go with the 3.88.  I drive mostly 
on flat ground as I live in Phoenix but i do occassionaly (every other month) 
make trips to SoCal.
