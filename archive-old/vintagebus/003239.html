It looks like the starter in my '67 bus may have bit the dust on me.  I have
a rebuilt (never been used) starter for a '69 ghia.
Are they interchangeable??
Also is it possible to swap out the starter without pulling the engine (I
_really_ dont want to go there unless I have to) ?

Thanks in advance
