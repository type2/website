I carry:

*2* extra belts
2 or 3 fuel filters
fuel pump
distributor cap, rotor, condensor,coil,points,plug wires,4 spark plugs
	(I can replace the entire ignition on the road)
fuel line
safety (bailing) wire
duct tape
clutch cable 
accelerator cable
3-4 quarts oil
barrel clamp for fuel line
axle boots
misc common nuts and bolts

All this stuff fits nicely under the front seat, except the oil, which goes
in the left &quot;battery&quot; tray in the engine compartment.
