Hi Jason

For your master cylinder, contact Wolfgang Int'l.  They sell an adapter($40)
which allows you to use a 73-79 MC ($40) I just put one on  my 67 std bus a
couple of weeks ago.  works great, and in the future I can just use the $40
MC if I ever need to replace.  You will need to use your old reservoir or
purchase a new one, but they just snap in place.

Bob

&gt; Hello there list, im new here, but been on vintagvw for years but just
&gt; recently acquired a reason to wander around these here parts.
&gt; http://members.aol_dot_com/jcwfla/bus.jpg  is that reason!
&gt; Ok I bought the bus as a quasi project, its runs and drives (sorta) but
sat
&gt; for a long time and needs lots of things.
&gt; Thing #1 - it needs a master cylinder. Ive changed these on bugs before
and
&gt; thought nothing of it, until seeing that its 1 yr only and $195 at
bus-boys!
&gt; Im sure the seller had a laugh.. i didnt imagine this was the case. Anyone
&gt; rebuild these? Its literally pouring fluid out of the shaft...
&gt; thing #2 - Needs shift bushings, sloppy (doesnt pop out of any gears tho),
&gt; one in the front, what about the coupler in the rear, where is it and how
&gt; hard to get to? (whole job..)?
&gt; thing #3 - has the safari windows and a stock antenna. How do i bend the
&gt; antenna to accomodate the safaris? should I take it to a machine/metal
shop?
&gt; Just put it in a vise and overcompensate the bend to get it in the
ballpark?
&gt; (it bends back).. any ideas?
&gt;
&gt; I think thats the short list for now.. has a few valdez sized oil leaks
too
&gt; but those i can resolve with a quick once over on the motor i
&gt; believe..thanks for any help, pmails fine if you can help me..
