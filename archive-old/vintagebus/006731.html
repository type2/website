An old timer once told me that the best way to revitalize rubber was to soak
it in Coca Cola, not Pepsi, but Coke, there is some ingredients in Coke that
will absorb in and soften the rubber back up, 15 years ago and before in my
356 Porsche days we did this quite often with some of the obsolete rubber
out of these vehicals and it worked, but with todays chemicals they put in
soft drinks I can not vouch for it but it could be worth a try.

So I went out last night to my FLoDS and picked up some glycerin (4 oz size,
undiluted) for about $2.50.  It says to dilute it 3 parts water to 1 part
glycerin.  What should I put it on with?  Spray bottle, rag, cloth, or pour
it on and spread it around with a foam brush?  I will be doing my floormats
this weekend...
