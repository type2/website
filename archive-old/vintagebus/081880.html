Subject: Re: [VB] Restore - frame and floor rot

Hi MKL,
It depends on many many factors, a few of which being year  (1950-55ish alot 
harder to find replacement sheet metal), model, location,  and wether or not 
you, or the top $$$$ body work shop of the world does the  work.  Probably most 
of all, what you might  perceive as pricey might to others seem very 
inexpensive.
