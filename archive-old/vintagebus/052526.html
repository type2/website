Subject: Re: [VB] Underdash gas heater question

Maybe the underdash units were fo dual treasure chest door single cabs?
Seems like they would be the unti of choice for truck as they would be
easier to install since you dont have to do all the cutting.

&gt;
&gt; That's an interesting point, because there are two
&gt; doublecabs here in my shop.  Barry's '63 has the
&gt; underdash unit (he just got it running, so no reports
&gt; from passengers yet), and my '61 DC had a heater in
&gt; the engine compartment w/ factory holes in the gas
&gt; tank bulkhead piece and the rear seat stand for
&gt; ductwork.  His bus has a steel gas line running from
&gt; the rear to feed the heater.  Were the under-dash
&gt; units dealer installed, maybe?  I can't believe that
&gt; the heater tube from the rear would take up that much
&gt; space in the &quot;air tight water proof lower compartment&quot;
&gt; of singlecabs.  My new '57 singlecab seems to have a
&gt; cavernous &quot;treasure chest&quot; area.
