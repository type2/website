&gt;Maybe we'd feel a _little_ better knowing he
&gt;didn't do it on purpose?

He positively did do it on purpose. Sorry. It's a terrible thing but it's true.

	&lt;RESOLUTION&gt;

I resolve not to post any more soppy stuff today. =^ )

	&lt;/RESOLUTION&gt;

So I wired this huge Christmas wreath to the front of the splitty. So big
it comes almost to the headlights. We made it from lots of garish bits we
bought at Pottery Barn which is a store where they sell practically
everything except pottery especially if it is tacky.

I know what you're thinking but the bus did not go any faster nor did it
take flight. I am now making inquiries about elk antlers. Certain grinches
have opined that the sheet metal in the roof probably can't handle the load
if I glue antlers on the bus with JB Weld but I will continue to search for
an appropriate engineering solution.

Doesn't David Schwardze cover his bus with green &amp; red LEDs every year? I
wish I knew how to do that. Any pictures out there?
