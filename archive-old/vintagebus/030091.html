&gt;  What is going to England?  We just brought the three nicest buses that
&gt; were
&gt;  in
&gt;  England to the US. A 54 RHD deluxe, a 53 swedish cargo door panel, and
&gt; a
&gt;  54
&gt;  RHD DD panel.

Funny thing there is they (the guys in the UK) will buy our &quot;rust free&quot; Buses, and
in the meantime we're buying up their rusty RHD Buses. I know of 3 RHD Barndoors
all within 150 miles of each other here in the Bay Area RHD DD Panel, RHD Panel,
and of course a RHD Deluxe. I was told the DD will be at Kelly park, don't think
the Deluxe will make it, and I know the RHD Panel won't!!
