I've got a rolling shell toy, a red BD ambulance, about 7&quot; long with a cross and the word Ambulance hot stamped on the front doors. Anybody seen this one before? It might be a Gay Toy brand, can't quite remember. It needs cargo doors and has holes in the floor for cot, chair, etc. Just looking for info.
