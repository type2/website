&lt;&lt; Have seen a scant few NOS clips for a scary price
 sometime ago. This might be a case wherein &quot;real&quot; is
 the only way to go... &gt;&gt;

OK everybody - I got the part numbers for the original VW hubcap clips.  (VW 
calls them springs.)  Don't forget it's a whole lot easier to install them w/ 
the correct tool.  My tool is pictured at the following site: 
http://onearth_dot_com/buscoop/images/cliptool.jpg
I don't know where I got it, but it says &quot;Hungary&quot; on it and has a ?part 
number? of 
P 001 and a logo of an &quot;S&quot; over a &quot;T&quot; in a vertical oval.

The clip (spring) is VW part number   111 601 131
and the rivet (use these, they're best)  N 013 407 1
(Also, these rivets fit the recess in the tool!)

Hope this is a help to everybody!  Now, I have to run to my VW dealer to 
order them before you guys backorder the whole country.
