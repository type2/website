Subject: Re: [VB] 64-67 bus gearbox info

Speaking of gearboxes, I have a question regarding how much goo...

I topped off the tranny last night (part of preparations for Shasta Trip),
and drained RGBs, then refilled them.

Today when I took this 60 DC with an early 67 drive train for a test drive,
I noticed more gear &quot;growl&quot; than usual...it may be that I was up all night
working on the thing, and was being hypersensitive...

I am going to look into those RGBs, though.  Is there a good way to tell if
I've got the right amount?

I used Sta-Lube GL-4 90 wt, with a sweetening of Lucas Tranny Oil additive.

Thanks!
