Hi all,

I've got a '64 Sundial Camper that is howling in 3rd and 4th, but only when
the accelerater is pushed, if I let off it stops.  Plus a very high pitched
whistle when clutch is in, when at a stop.  This goes away if I push the gas a
bit then comes back at idle again.  I've topped off the gear lube in the trans
and red. gear boxes but still no help.  Any tips?

Thanks

Jeff
