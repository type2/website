&gt; Hello,
&gt;    I was just wondering if anyone had any good suggestions or experience
&gt; replacing their wiring harness?

J.D.,
I tackled a new wiring harness on my old '60 Panel.  If I can do this anyone
can!  Just take your time and label the old wires so that you know what color
goes where. Attach a line to the front end of the old harness and make sure
you have plenty of line(I used weed wacker cord) and pull the old harness
from the rear of the bus.  Once the harness is out, attach the new harness to
the line and reverse process.  Take your time and slowly pull.  Don't for as
you don't want to damage that new harness.  Once the harness is under the bus
and through to the cab, hook the wires where they should be.  It rather a
simple process if you take your time.  Since wiring my old Panel 'Sparky', I
have done my '68 bug.  Have fun, take your time and be proud of your
accomplishments when you are finished.

Joy thru air,
Jamie
