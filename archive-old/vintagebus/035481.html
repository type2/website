&lt;&lt; 've been looking for some WWII trinkets, and someone
 told me that there's a pin that has a little cog with
 a kdf-wagen in front of the cog.  Does anyone have one
 of these?  Does anyone have a picture or point me in
 the right direction?  Just wondering what they look
 like and how much they are going for.  
  &gt;&gt;

Be careful of reproductions, I seen one in an antique store a few years back 
but it was a repro. I believe one of the vw mags did a story on how to tell 
the difference a few years  back. Happy Hunting.
