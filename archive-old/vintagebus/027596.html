It's a DIN standard.  Where to find it, I don't know.  I do know that ALL
German cars have the same terminal numbers and that German cars all use the
same color code in the wiring.  ie: a brown wire is ALWAYS grounded.  I used
to have a small booklet that had the color codes and their destinations but it
has gone the way of too many things.

Good luck, and if you find it, please pass it on to me.

  Is there someplace on the
&gt; net I can find out the &quot;standard&quot; numbering scheme for
&gt; electrical components?  I am guessing that, for
&gt; example, the headlight switch on my 66 bus doesn't
&gt; have the numbers 30, 56, 57, 58, and 58b randomly.
&gt; There must be someplace that dictates a 30 terminal to
&gt; be something like &quot;fused power&quot; and 58 to be power
&gt; output or something.  Any ideas?  Thanks!
