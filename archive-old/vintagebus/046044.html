&gt;  See That And Raise One.
&gt;  
&gt;  My Bus has no seats and everytime I go to a show and look at what people 
are
&gt;  using for seats I can't figure out if they have the right ones.  I would
&gt;  really like to know what types of seats to hunt for.

&gt;  55 Kombi/Standard?
&gt;  
the rear seat would be a regular splitty rear seat (an early bay will work, 
but are a slightly narrower width).

the middle seat would be the metal grab barred one, and as your kombi is a 
55, it would be the 6 legged variety, which was used through mid 56.  

believe you would used black upholstery.
