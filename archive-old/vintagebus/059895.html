Here is the original post made on the T3 list. The guy that posted this is pretty savvy.

VW recommends that the only cleaning recommended is to scrape 
off any dirt accululation from the bottom of that part, especially 
around the air holes. This is only ever necessary in extremely 
dusty operating conditions.

In fact I believe VW specifically recommends NOT to wash the filter 
in any kind of solvent, although I don't see how a gentle flushing 
with a very mild sovent could hurt anything, AS LONG AS you let it 
dry out thoroughly first. You DON'T want to wash it out in gasoline 
and then try to start up your engine; that might start a fire that we'd 
ALL regret.

Normally, all the dirt gets carried to the bottom of the bottom half 
with the oil, and cleaning out this part is all that is necessary. VW 
warns not to turn the upper part upside-down at any time, because 
this can cause dirty oil to drain into the wrong part of the filter 
chamber.

Wouldn't the oil at the bottom of the air cleaner be meant to replace
this? Like cleaning and reoiling your K and N?&gt;

A guy on the T3 list advised that the horsehair should be left alone and
not cleaned unless it is badly clogged. According to him, the oil
deposits on the horsehair are needed to trap contaminants.
