Sounds like you're very fortunate that nut didn't back all the way off -
that would have been pretty exciting en route to OCTO, etc.

You're also fortunate not to have to mess with the tie rods and getting a
new alignment job.

&gt;&gt;  So, I get the belly pan off, and set to evaluating my steering play.
Hmm.  What's this?  The (un)safety wire I'd used to lock the
castellated nut to the drag link was compromised - it had sheared,
and the nut was slowly backing off.  I tightend it down, tied it with
some heavier-duty wire, and now I've got Formula One steering.  &lt;&lt;
