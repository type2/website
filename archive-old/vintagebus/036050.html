Hi All, I was going through a box of spare parts to look for a 59' door

handle for a friend. There appears to be two different types. The screws

that hold it in place, seem to be a different distance from where the

gasket/base sits on the outer door. Does that make any sense? Could one be

for an early  Beetle? I thaink they all had &quot;211&quot; part numbers..

TIA

yes there is more than one type for the 12/63 and earlier buses.   in late 
60-  oct I think - they changed the doors on the bus where the front handles 
go- earlier if the handle was gone if would b flat, later had the indent.  
The door handle was changed to match at the same time.   You can sort of get 
the wrong handle on there, but it doesn't fit quite right.   The earlier 
handles have a thinner base, the later are thicker.  

there are bug icepick handle too.  some have a line down the handle, but the 
earliest ones (dunno the year  of change- sometime in early 50s) are same as 
bus.  Barndoor handles are interchangable with later bus handles, but the 
casting of the ice pick is cruder.    54-63 drivers handles used the same key 
profile. 53 and earlier buses used  different key profile for the doors than 
54 on, it is shorter and the locks take 4 wafers instead of 6.   yes 
barndoors came with 2 keys- one for the ignition, and the other fit the doors.

took me about 5 years to find a 53 drivers door handle.   Harder to find than 
53 taillights.
