I was tired when I wrote this so let me make some corrections and additions.

&gt;nice simple and filling meal.  It's funny how she can take left overs and

&gt;running into fasteners that were rusted so hard, not even the impact wrench
&gt;could brake them loose!  I twised off the lower shock bolt on the driver's


With those corrections made, I wanted to add that the driver's side redux
box still contains the original blue VW seal AND the bearing was missing
about 4 or 5 rollers (these are the bearings that are all in pieces) which
handles the main support weight of the bus.  I have no idea how the rollers
disappeared unless they crumbled and fell inside the redux box.  Anyway,
it's still a roller so that I can bolt it into the 66 to have a rolling
chassis.  I RTV'd some leak points and slapped that puppy together.  The
passenger side axle shaft barely has enough good threads left - I must have
really tore them up removing the axle nut initially.  Pity shame it was
rusted so bad.  That whole corner acted as if it sat under water as rusted
as everything was.

So now the engine sits on a dolly cart with all the parts and the trans
assembly is on the jack under the engine bay.  I'll get that stuff out of my
way tonight and start doing a cleaning and painting.
