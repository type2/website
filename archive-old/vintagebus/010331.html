Subject: New 1600 FI engine availability???

On Feb. 27, 2001 Bob Wallace in the UK mentioned [see below] new 1600 FI
engines.

Has anyone had personal experience with installing one of these as a
replacement for a 1600DP engine in a Transporter/bus/camper?

Do they come as a turnkey setup with FI and associated equipment
included/installed?  If so, what is the cost for such an engine?

Are these engines available anywhere besides the UK?  If so, where?

Thanks for any information you can offer.....

UK.  &lt;&lt;
