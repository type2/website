Subject: RE: [VB] Trailer Mounts

  I have an allstate bumper mount bracket, but it does not work with the
clam shell allstate I have. The clamshell has a totaly different mounting
system then my flat/bed box allstate and my Harris.
  I will take pictures of all 3 trailers, the bumper bracket and the hitch I
made and post them on the Samba for comparrison

&gt;Sean,

&gt;I recently picked up the same model Allstate you and Ronnie have.  Mine
came
&gt;with mounting brackets and all the hardware, but it would mount right up to
&gt;the bumper.  If you are interested I can send you a couple of pics.  Do you
&gt;have any of the bracket hardware.  From the pics it looks as though you
&gt;might have the arms.

There is a good picture of the mounts I have on your site

Not the pivot / spring, but the other smaller pieces.

Not the best picture, but you get the idea. I will take detailed photos 
tomorrow

They are adjustable and clamp to the bumper bracket. I use these for my 
Allstate, Coffman, and my Montgomery Wards before I sold it.
