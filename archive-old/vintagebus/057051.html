Subject: LAST CALL T-SHIRTS!!!


Howdy. I just wanted to remind everyone that all t-shirt orders should be mailed by this coming Monday or Tuesday at the latest, to insure they get to me on time. I'm placing the final order next Friday, March 29th, to insure I get everything ready in time for EveryBus. So, if I get your order after that, it will unfortunately be too late. While I may have a few extra Everybus shirts at the event, in the past they have sold out very quickly. 

   I have finally gotten the finished artwork back from the printer for the Everybus 2002 shirts. It's up on the www.teamspatula_dot_com t-shirt page. Don't forget that Everybus 2001 shirts sold out in like 15 minutes, so make sure to get your order in early this year! 
  So, without further ado, I shall give the details for pre-ordering shirts. At this time, I will be printing four (4) separate designs which you may choose from, all viewable on the t-shirt page:
1. Everybus 2002 shirts
2. Vintagebus/type2 official Netvergnugen list shirts
3. Air Cooled Search &amp; Rescue Team red on grey
4. Air Cooled Search &amp; Rescue Team white on navy

  I will be accepting orders until March 28th. Please get them in as soon as possible. I will be taking the final count to the printers on the 29th in order to insure that I will have everything ready for Everybus.
  Sizes are available in child's Medium up through adult XXXL (although XXL and XXXL cost more)
  All designs cost $15.00 each. Long sleeved shirts are available for any design for $20.00. XXL shirts also cost $20.00, and XXXL cost $22.00
Shipping is $5.00 PER SHIRT. (obviously, if you are planning to come to Everybus, there is no shipping charge for pick-up at the event).
  
  Please mail a check or money order to:
Poor Richard Palmer
121-C Park Ave
Raleigh, NC, 27605-1832

Please also enclose an index card with your 
Name
Mailing address
E-mail address
Number, Design, Color, and Size of shirts ordered

Thanks again, and e-mail me with any questions.
