&gt; where.

the split bus club is camping in the santa cruz redwoods.  there is a campground along highway 9 on the way to boulder creek.  last year when i posted some fliers at the local parts shop, i had to phone and ask the parts place to pull the fliers down as the club didn't have enough campground places reserved for a huge showing.
