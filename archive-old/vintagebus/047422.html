&lt;&lt; Let me try to enlighten you older people, well older people should know 
more 
 about this then the the youth. Primer is a look and a state of mind, its a 
 style, look fifties american customs. I would rather drive original paint on 
 a bus, but if I couldn't, I would rather drive primer than an incorrect 
paint 
 color. &gt;&gt;

My bus is both Original Paint and primer.  This is due to being hit by a 
moron and of course im a broke 20 year old punk.  Many of my friends have had 
pimer busses and I have been seing a local trend here.  Rather than just your 
standard grey they are now 2-toning busses with colored primer.  Ive seen a 
pink and white one, green and white one, a baby blue one and white which 
looks like a rolling skyscape.  

My 57 is in grey primer with flames and had red wheels.  Also seen many flat 
black with red wheels.
