Subject: We have lift off!!!!!!

It's alive....ALIVE!!!!!

1600cc DP engine that I tore-down for repair, rebuilt and put back 
the '59 Kombi it came out of.

Well, first I'd like to thank the list for working with me on this 
problem. All the advice was good and really helped.

I'd especially like to thank Ronnie from http://www.oldvolks_dot_com . 
After i posted a message to the list yesterday whining and wondering 
what I should do about my engine, I got a phone call. &quot;Ronnie from 
Arizona&quot; my wife tells me. Ronnie picked up the phone on HIS dime and 
called me. Now that's some serious customer service!!! I mean, I 
haven't bought a ton of stuff from him or anything. He's got my phone 
number from when he's had to call me back about parts. And, with no 
profit to gain, he picked up the phone and called to help me work out 
the problem with my engine. Can't say enough thanks.

Ronnie's instructions (which some other list members touched on as 
well) to pop off the valve cover and get everything in #1 position by 
watching the intake valve was the first step. I discovered that I had 
indeed dropped the disty drive gear in 180 degrees. So I flipped the 
disty wires 180 degrees and made sure the valves were all adjusted 
properly while I was there (they weren't....sloppy work cause I was 
going by the line on the distributor...stupid, stupid, stupid). So I 
got all that in order.

My second contributing problem was the fact that I have an engine 
built up on a '75 Fuel Injection Bug engine. It doesn't have a 
mechanical fuel pump, so you have to use an electric one. So every 
time I had the ignition on to do anything, the fuel was getting 
pumped into the carb. This definatly caused some flooding. My 
solution was to put a switch up in the cab that I could flip the pump 
on and off with. The PO had wired the electric fuel pump to the fuse 
box. So adding a switch up there was easy. And I happened to have a 
nice high power on/off switch left over from the birthday present I 
made for my wife last summer 
(http://web2.airmail_dot_net/khmiller/arcade/ ) . So after I got the 
switch in I changed the oil to make sure I didn't have a lot of gas 
in there.

So after all this, I climbed up front and started it up. I did the 
break in. It ran pretty good. I still need to time it and make idle 
adjustments. Hopefully tommarrow after work I can do that and take it 
for the initial drive.

Thanks again for all the help from the list during this whole engine 
rebuild. It was my first time and I was real green about the whole 
thing. I learned tons and wouldn't trade any of the trouble or time 
for anything. I've conquered what to me was a great milestone. I took 
apart a broken engine, fixed it and put it back together.

Special thanks to Craig K in Austin for &quot;schooling&quot; me on how to 
measure and inspect my case and parts. Also for helping me out with 
parts and a machinist.

Another special thanks again to Ronnie for showing there STILL is 
good old fashioned customer service, even from mail/internet parts 
supplier!!!!

Man, I feel like I'm giving a speech for winning a grammy!!!!!

p.s. I'll be updating my website with my engine experiece over the 
next few weeks.
