I have to disagree Thom.  A collector, IMHO, is not going to see a scanned 
copy as devaluing the original in the same way that replicars or posters of 
the Masters art works do not devalue the original.  An original is just 
that.  I love to read and I am particular to first edition hardbacks and 
find that on the used market subsequent editions will not impact the 
desirability of rarer first edition to those who seek them.

The scanning of out of print material for VWs is, I feel, a sharing of 
knowledge that should have no impact the market value of the original from 
which it is made.  Course, some children just don't want to share with 
others.  Call the Yard Duty!!!

At least that is what I tell my wife :-) and she tolerates my foibles.

&gt;OTOT, scanning these and making them available &quot;devalues&quot; the &gt;originals, 
&gt;but oh-well - I ain't in it for the money.
