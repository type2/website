&gt;I might yank the tach and install cylinder head temp... I know where
&gt;it tachs now.

Clara, forgive me if I'm preaching to the choir, but you may not be
able to re-use the cable that you used for the oil pressure,
temperature, and tach for the CHT.  The instructions for the VDO
CHT gauge specify that the wiring that runs from the sender to the
gauge is not to be spliced or otherwise modified.

The difference is that the oil pressure, oil temperature, and tach
work with signals that are in the range of tenths of a volt to a
few volts, and at least hundredths to tenths of an amp.  These
signals are relatively unaffected by sloppy splices, loose connections,
or wire that's too thin.

The signal coming from the thermocouple that mounts on the head is on
the order of a few thousandths of a volt at a few thousandths of an
amp, so it is much less tolerant of bad wiring.  Also, since most
combinations of dissimilar metals make a thermocouple, if you splice
a steel wire coming from the thermocouple under the spark plug to a
copper wire running to the gauge... you just made another thermocouple
at the splice, which will introduce errors into the gauge reading.

I want to be clear: I still endorse the idea of running a multi-wire
cable for ease of installing more than one of most kinds of gauges.
It's just that CHT has to be treated a little differently.
