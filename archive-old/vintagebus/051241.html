They seem to like running out on steep hills which makes sense.  I would
always seem to run out on a third gear hill right after getting off I-40
going north on 14.  I always thought it would die before it caught but I
was always barely able get it to catch in time.
If it was low I started pulling out the reserve. (now pushing in since I
have one of those reversed taps)
