Well the Canadian contingent is preparing to leave in the morning. No bus
this trip 'cause we're picking up the '77 on the way back. On another note,
got a call tonight from a guy selling a driveaway tent, I've already got
one, but he's on my way to the ferry so I'll probably buy it from him. No
idea on condition or price but I'll have it there a OCTO and the classic if
anyone's interested. Be nice to see sunshine and buses without rust.
