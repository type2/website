I have always wondered about this... Sure you can have a balanced fan, but
it is worthless unless the pulley and generator is balanced with it.  Just
having the fan balanced is like dynamically balancing a crank without the
flywheel.

Actually I was planning on taking the whole fan/gen/pulley assembly to Jake
Raby to try and balance it anyway :)  I say try because I have not heard of
anyone doing this before...

Actually, back when Super Vee was the thing, getting every available pony
from a 1200cc meant hand balancing everything, including the fan. A well
known hydroplane racing team in Spokane used to balance VW and Corvair fans.
Since they are sheet metal essentially, they would run it a small flying
wheel balance and then run an arc weld bead where necessary. They then
ground the arc weld and kept spinning it up until it was balanced to the
gram.
