Has anyone dabbled in the gas additives?  I'm always up late at night
getting sucked into these fancy additive infommercials.  You've seen the
hype.  Protect the life of your engine, increase gas mileage, impress the
women, blah blah blah...  What about oil treatments?  So far i've always
kept my engines on the clean and sober side.  Do they deserve to let loose
and guzzle a few libations every now and then too?
