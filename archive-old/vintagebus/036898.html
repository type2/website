 Ok, My friend is (finally) getting his bus together but he has come across
 some problem that we can not figure out.
 #1 It won't start everytime.It used to start everytime up until last week,
 now starts about once every 20 tries. Didn't start at all today. Starter
 just clicks. Reads 12.5volts at the battery, we cleaned the terminals and
 the ground point. So we figure it is the starter (which is probably bad but
 this isn't the problem) So we push start it so he can drive it home from the
 paint guy's house. Check the voltage coming from the generator (at idle it
 reads -10volts)He blames the negative reading on his voltmeter acting up.
 Runs fine so he drives it home (10 miles?) Doesn't make it home. It seems
 the generator isn't charging the battery, which is strange because last week
 we drove it to a show (maybe 5 miles away at night with the lights on) with
 no problems starting or driving. The PO had taken the bus apart for paint
 and labeled all the wires (some incorrectly) and after the show he was
 poking around and noticed the generator was wired backwards (so he thought)
 so he switched them. Is it possible that the generator is now wired
 backwards and that is keeping it from charging? Would that affect the
 starter too?
============
does the gen light on the dash come on?  In a nutshell, yes the battery will 
not charge if the wires on not hooked up properly.  So get a wiring diagram 
(look at vintagebus_dot_com for yours)and make sure everything is hooked up 
properly.  also check your generator brushes
..............................
 Q#2
 Passenger side taillight will not come on. Power is going to both terminals,
 we assume the housing isn't grounding so he runs a wire to a good ground,
 still nothing. Bulb is good, put it in the other side to check. Am I missing
 something, I've tried using some aluminum foil in the socket to make sure it
 grounds, nothing. Lost on that one too. He wanted me to ask before we tow it
 to Jeff's Bug Shop (he's pricey but he's been doing it for 30+ years)
 Thanks,
 Brian
=========
get out your test lamp.  turn headlight on halfway. open the engine lid.  Is 
there power going to the right taillight- it should be the white/red striped 
wire at the taillight.

if the wire gets power, but the bulb isnt getting it, take hold of the wire 
where it is puished on to the spade connector and wiggle it.   I have been 
having the same problem with my 61, it is corrosion, and what I need to do is 
take the light bulb out, and clean (lights off) the little thingys that 
contact the bulb from the light, and wher ethe bulb ground to the holder.

if the wire doesn't get power, you check the fuse box.  blown fuse? check 
your wiring diagram foir which fuse is the right rear taillight.   Check 
power at both sides of the fuse with taillight on.  twirling the old fuses 
can help, if there is corrosion building between the fuse and fusebox.    
This happens often in buses that sit, especially in wet climates.  and in 
bugs the fuse box is under the hood, I used to have to clean the fuse for the 
wipers every year, until I moved to washington where the rain is lighter

See- you just trace the power to find where it stops, and generally just use 
some fine sandpaper to clean the connections.   using a small screwdriver, 
and loosen and tightening the screwterminals will help the electrical 
connections.  But every connection has to work for the bulb to come on 
bright.  

Its not a bad idea to take some time and clean the electrical system from on 
end to another.  Including taking apart the horn button assembly, and 
cleaning that.  I like a nice loud horn.  BRRRRAAAAPPPPP!  That and a crusty 
bus with stuff hanging off the edges of the roof rack the people driving new 
cars give you lots of space on the freeway.  They dont drive up your 
tailpipe.  And let you merge (I use an assertive lane changing technique, as 
seen in caravan to New Brighton State Beach last weekend) when they see your 
bright lights.
