Subject: Getting Crushed

NEVER GET UNDER ANY VEHICLE THAT IS ONLY SUPPORTED ON A JACK!!  Always use
safety jack stands (I use two on each side in case one slips or breaks).

I have heard of so people who have removed one wheel to adjust brakes or
change wheels while the vehicle is only on a jack.  Then while they are
sitting on the ground with their legs stretched out under the vehicle only
to have the jack slip off and the vehicle come crashing down crushing their
legs.

If you have ever taken apart one of those floor jacks, you will see that
you are trusting your life to two small pins that hold the arms to the side
of the hydraulic cylinder.

Put the jack stands under something solid such as the torsions, or main
subframe.

We don't need to lose any of you, $30 for a pair of good safety jack stands
is VERY CHEAP life insurance!!
