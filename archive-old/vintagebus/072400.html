Subject: Re: [VB] Re: advise needed

You can level the Bus back out by putting a 12 V battery in front of the
left tail light.  If you're a real vintage purist you can even strap it
down.  With this battery, you can convert the left side of your bus to
12 V, so the headlight on your side is brighter, but the right side is
all mint NOS NIB OG VW.

This is something I'm going to do.
