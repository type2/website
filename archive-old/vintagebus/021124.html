Subject: Re: [VB] undercover cops at jerome

I like that, I have heard that on tv and on the radio,
&quot;I am asking for my friends&quot;. Maybe you should tell
your friends to smoke there dope at home, not out in
public. Give me a break.

&gt; hey people,
&gt; 
&gt; i've not been able to read the list very frequently
&gt; the last couple of weeks.  service through this
&gt; provider was up and down.  i've read all the posts
&gt; that had jerome in the subject and saw no discussion
&gt; about the undercover cops that are supposed to be
&gt; patrolling the gold king mine looking for illegal
&gt; drugs and underage drinkers.  is this rumor true or
&gt; just scare mongering?  of course if it is true i'm
&gt; not scared because my preferred drugs are legal, i'm
&gt; old enough and i'm a happy drunk... i'm only asking
&gt; for my friends....
&gt;
