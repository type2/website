&gt; Maybe some day I'll drag myself down to AZ, but right now I can't afford
to
&gt; take a week off work.  Time == money.  But by the time comes that I *can*
&gt; afford to take a week off, I'll probably be banned from any AZ show anyway
&gt; because you-know-who will have bought it.

Nope, we're not going to sell it to you-know-who, we're going to keep it
forever until all of the hoopty bus drivers are in rehab and no one shows
up.
