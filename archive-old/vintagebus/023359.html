Hi Ken,
Just FYI the bus fuel tank is high enough that if it is at least half way full
or more you can hook the tank directly to the carb and the engine will run
fine.  Only the single cab with it's tank forward and lower can not do this.
Also make sure you run a length of fuel line to both of the fuel pumps lines
to prevent any left over fuel from spraying out of the pump while driving like
this.     Eric &amp; Barb
