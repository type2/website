 &gt; two big screws per hinge or 4/door.    yes they can be a bear.  dont tweak
 &gt; the screw or you get to drill them out :(
 
 
  Ok, now I am nervous about doing this. What is an impact driver and where
 can I find one? And how do I keep from losing that backing plate? A friend
 told me it would not be cool if that backing plate fell off.....
 How do I know when I need to stop trying with the screwdriver? And when you
 guys speak of drilling it out, are you referring to a process like using an
 &quot;easy out&quot;?

yes like Thom says an impact is better than a fat screwdriver.  But if it is 
not too rusty I have successfully used a screwdriver with vise grips on the 
handle.   did you get your plastic plugs out so you know what this looks 
like?   okay get the screwdriver or impact (an impact is a thing you pound on 
one end with a hammer, the other end has a thing like a ratchet on it you can 
put a socket on.   get a socket fitting with a big phillips screwdriver bit 
on it for this purpose.    you twist the handle one way for tighten, the 
other way to losen, then pound, the impact is translated into the appropriate 
twisting motion. available where fine or not so fine tools are sold.  I got a 
snap on set with various screwdriver bits on it, which I have broken and 
replaced  bits a few times on.  old vws can be hard on tools)  Okay, hit the 
end with a hammer.  spray penetrating oil.  repeat.  If you have time it is 
easier to do this for a few days,  I mean not constantly for a few days, but 
occasionally for a few days.   then... get the rathcet on the socket or the 
vise grips on the screwdriver, push in hard and undo.  Careful not to mess up 
the screwhead.    The ones for the drivers cab door on my 61 had to be 
torched to remove the old door, rust etc you see, usually top ones are easier 
to undo.  (my door was mangled due to impact by stupid driver, and was really 
annoying to open/shut, had to go)  Torching does tend to kill the paint 
though.   I smeared grease over the blackened bits, which horrified Damon (he 
does paint VWs, says thats a PITA to clean up to get paint to stick, but that 
beast wasn't getting paint anytime soon), whose friends generously and 
enthusiastically offered to remove the old door and install the replacement 
in exchange for getting the old rusted impacted door, which surprised me 
enourmously.  Anyway, 

If the screw does get buggered up beyond use, get out your drill and bits 
set.  start small, drill straight through the  bolt whose head you mangled.  
It will have a nice round thing to make it easier to center.   Then change 
for the next bigger drill bit, until you are just barely below the size of 
the bolt.  The remains of the threads should come out now.  Clean up the 
threads with a tap.   Some people may have had luck with easy outs here, but 
not me.

If you do the top ones first, usually the bottom ones are worse. 

To avoid losing the plate if all this breaks it loose... dont take chances.   
after the first bolt of each pair  is one, thread a stud in there, or wire.  
It wont drop the plate if held up.  fishing it out is not fun, dont go there.

Now you have the old doors off, right?   and probably all your bolts are 
messed up.   go get some new ones at Metric Man or your local nut and bolt 
supply house, use grease or antiseize when installing new doors.   Enjoy!

On fairly dry climate (low rust) buses this is not a big deal.
