Subject: Re: [VB] looking for 48's or 44's for my type 4 motor

&gt; Eric,
&gt;
&gt; What are you going to put this GIAN rubber band into?  Not your bus I
&gt; hope!
&gt;
64 Bug. Fiberglass fenders, hood, and decklid, plexi windows, chromoly cage,
and aluminum front beam.

Should be light, and should hit low 11's in the quarter.

Funny part is, while driving to Sacto over Labor Day, it was me, my wife, my
son, my dad, and my dad's friend piled in the bus doing the 650 mile drive.
While making the slow drive, my dad's friend looked at me while driving the
bus and said &quot;I don't get it. You want your street bug (yes, it will be
liscensed and tagged) to be as fast as you can get it, but you prefer to
drive this slow bus on cross-state trips?&quot;

It makes perfect sense to me, LOL!  I even plan on towing my bug to the out
of state shows with my 'slo bus'. I'll just have to leave a half day
earlier! hahahaha
