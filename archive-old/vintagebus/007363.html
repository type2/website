Hello all ye who art interested in the guy/company in Oakland who
powdercoats things for a nice price....

It was a nasty day to be driving down there, but I did it, occasionally
using my wipers, and never going over 60mph, to the delight of all those
with me on the freeway.  I saw two accidents (or rather, the results of
such), and one early 70's bug (I think) with engine lid up....looked like a
mass of mangled, melted magnesium!  Bummer!  Check those lines and clean yer
engine compartments!  (Which is actually something I need to do ASAP!
Bartholomew smells INSIDE when I fill up....may be a cracked filler neck or
somethin')

Anyway, Dave Taylor, the contact at Bay Area Powdercoatings, is really
cool...I saw a plaque of appreciation or something like that from the Hell's
Angels on the office wall....he expressed a good interest in my doublecab,
and he seemed honest, and like the &quot;real&quot; kind of person I generally like to
work with....

It's a big operation down there....he told me that he doesn't like/need to
&quot;rape&quot; people for dough...that's why his prices are so good....he makes his
money doing big industrial stuff, and he's got plenty of work, so us &quot;little
guys&quot; can do things like get our truck gates blasted and powdercoated for
$35 apiece, for instance....I'm thinking of having him blast and coat the
DC's bed, and the inside of the gates.  I hear that powdercoating doesn't
make for good finish on large flat surfaces, but I do want to be able to use
my truck for what it is!

Anyway, my take on the operation is that it is large, not smooth and shiny,
but not a con, either....I'll definitely be reporting on the outcome!

Eric &amp; Barb:  I will ask him about coating the inside/back of the
rims....thanks!

Later,
Gene Cornelius
