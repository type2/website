Subject: #3 valve burned?
Message-id: &lt;38960451.4a69.0_at_beer_dot_com&gt;

Hey there bus freaks,  **Stupid Question Alert**

Well, I tested my compression awhile ago and found:
#1 - 125 lbs
#2 - 120 lbs
#3 - 85 lbs
#4 - 120 lbs

Uh-oh.  Ran some diesel thru the carb as per Muir, to no avail.  So I guess
I need a valve job?  I'm a little (OK, a lot) unclear as to what this actually
entails.  Am planning to pull the heads off on Friday, as I understand it both
heads should be done.  Should I just get new ones?  What should I be looking
for?

To complicate matters, it seems like the bus sometimes regains it's lost power
for little spurts, then goes back to eternal slowness.  Would that be the valve
finding its proper place for a little while, or coming unstuck or something?


Any advice welcome, 
Diana
