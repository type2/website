Well I talked to the owner, made a deal and went to the Post Office and sent 
him a Next Day letter with a Deposit...........

Well you would think I bought it......

WRONG......he just called and said he sold it to someone else, after he had 
made a deal with me !

Oh well I hope the Post Office does not lose my letter/deposit..........
