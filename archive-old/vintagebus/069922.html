Subject: Re: [VB] survey: testing cooling etc [VB] was side scoops

OK, then get rid of them nasty old scoops!

.....


is a possible increase of engine compartment air pressure,
--------------------- Clip --------------------
Pressure has nothing to do with it.
Proper cooling is related to having enough air flow of fresh cooler air.
Having 5 times as much air as the engine needs doesn't make it run cooler
or warmer .......... it simply requires enough.
If you could direct more to the oil cooler you might get lower
temperatures.
I had problems with engine heat on my 82 Type IV air cooled and an oil
cooler brought it right down, nothing complicated or expensive.
