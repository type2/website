Subject: mirror arm lock plates

  I was always searching for the washers and lock plates for my mirror arms
when I discovered when taking apart some window frames, that the washers and
lock plates are the same on the wing vent frame post as the OG ones on the
mirrors. Hurray I say to myself, I now have a pile of lock plates and
washers for all my buses.
  So when you see those beat up rusty window frames with no glass in them
for a buck at the swaps, buy them for the wing vent hardware for your mirror
arms.

ronnie  discovery is always a good thing
