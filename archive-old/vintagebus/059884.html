Subject: Re: [VB] pre-67 westy hammocks

Unfortunately to my not knowing Westy hammocks it turns out this one is a
bay window 68-up.
The poles are the same length.
So, if anyone is interested or knows someone looking for a cherry bay window
hammock.
I've got one for sale.
$50 plus shipping.
I'm located in the Bay area.

Thanks,
Dave Barnes

&gt; The rear pole is 55 1/4&quot; long. If I remember right, the front pole is 49&quot;
&gt; long. The canvas will be green and trapezoidal in shape. About a 1/2&quot;
shorter
&gt; than the poles.

&gt; Hi everyone,
&gt; Is there a way to tell original material for the pre-67 hammocks.
&gt; What is the length of the rails also?
&gt;
&gt; I just picked up one today that is supposedly original material and it's
in
&gt; near perfect unused condition. Told it came out of a 66 westy. But just
want
&gt; some list clarification.
&gt; The seller wanted $75, but took $50. I haven't seen an early cot in this
shape
&gt; before, much less the scarcity of early ones anyways.
&gt;
