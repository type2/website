The Welder on ebay is way too expensive !!!

I just post an add in my local Newsgroup (mtl.forsale) an i had answer from
a guy willing to sell his Lincoln mig with gaz conversion for 250$ CA (new
its 400$ Ca without conversion kit)

so its way better to try to find any tools used around our community first
than Ebay !!!

my 2 cent
