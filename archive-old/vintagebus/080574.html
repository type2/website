Subject: RE: [VB] 010 versus 019 Dizzy

I tried a German 009 in the split a few years ago and hated it compared with 
the 019.  The 009 never seemed to get on &quot;curve&quot; until the revs were way 
up...  Which is true since it is all in at 3500RPM.

... In actuality the 019 should be all in at 3500, but I think it is only 
running one spring and goes all in at 2500.  :)

The 019 has 17 degrees total advance compared with the 010 with 20 degrees.  
Not sure about the 009?

I have decided to go with the 010 as with two springs it is all in at 2500 
with the 20 degreees, giving a little more juice than a 019 with one spring. 
  Heck drop a spring on the 010 and you are all in at 1500! (not good)

Thanks,
Adrian Pillow

&gt;Neither, with that tranny I'd be running a .009 or .050 dual point.
