As a followup question to this previous thread, I wanted to ask if anyone
sells customized colors for Kombi ceiling panels. I guess I can't really use a
Deluxe type headliner, but want to get away from the standard production
colors that I've seen from most dealers.

I made the roof panels in my 65 westy from hardboard (1/8&quot;)   used jigsaw,
needed to have a template, and sand the edges a bit thinner as the original
stuff was thinner, so it would fir in the channels.  I spray painted in grey,
you could paint it whatever your heart desires.
