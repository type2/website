new bus, brakes not working right. Now,

I do believe you shouldn't skimp on safety, but I also believe in if it aint 
broke dont fix it.

SO first INSPECT the brakes.   I take it you have driven this bus?   Jack up 
the front (I usd the middle of the lower torsion beam) and take a front wheel 
off.  (get an Idiots Book by John Muir).  Take off the hub cap, take off the 
dust cap, undo the allen or lock nuts, and pulled the drum w/wheel off.   Are 
the shoes okay?   or worn through?   everything should be dry.  Pull back the 
rubber dust covers on the wheel cylinders- if you see fluid replace all on 
that axle.    Okay,  ditto w/real but of course you need to pop the wheel on 
the front back on first and you un do that big rear axle nut with the wheel 
on the ground.   Allways clean and grease the adjusting stae threads and 
where they spin when you have th shoes off or if they stick and you will have 
joy of brake adjustment.    If the rubber hoses are cracked or growing 
tumours, or over 5 years old I'd go ahead and buy new one.   Master cylinders 
dont often fail, and the 2 circuit 67 one is costlier that the circa $30 for 
a 55-67 (also usable on barndoors)   Does it leak?

also, sometimes adjustment and bleeding often make brakes fine.   I like to  
flush all old fluid out once a year to prolong hydraulic parts life.   Brake 
fulid oops fluid is clear.  The fluid in your brake system should be clear.  

find a friend who has had experience w/ brakes to help.  I'm told the stem is 
similar for whatever make.   And what are friends for anyway?   they want to 
ride in your stylee bus, you know they do.


drive safe  :)

Aside from the funny comments, I just completed this fiasco myself on a 66
Crew cab.  IMHO, here's what you need to do.  I paid about $150 for all the
parts to completely replace my entire brake system.  Small price to pay for
making sure your bus stops when you want it to.

All numbers are approximate -

E-brake cables - 2 (2 rear)
Wheel cylinders - 6 (4 front, 2 rear)
Brake hoses - 4 (2 front, 2 rear)
Brake shoes - 8 (4 front, 4 rear)
Brake spring kit - 2 (1 front, 1 rear)
Misc seals/gaskets - 4 (2 front, 2 rear)
Hard barke lines - 5 (2 front, 1 long a$$ one to go from front to rear, 2
rear)
Tee fitting - 2 (1 front, 1 rear)
Master cylinder - 1 (mine was single chamber)
Reservoir - 1
Cap - 1
Brake switch - 1
Brake fluid - 1 liter (don't get the racing stuff, just normal DOT-3 works
best on the street)

Optioanl stuff (upon inspection, felt they were ok)
Drums - had them turned, the lining is good for a long time to come!
