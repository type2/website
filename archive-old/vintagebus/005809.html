Well I just got my tilt canvas from PLF and it looks top notch. I looked for
a while and the only other place that makes it that I found was
http://www.vintagewarehouse_dot_com/parts.htm
but those are $900!! so PLF is  your best bet..just like OG.
The guy I had make my hoops was DG enterprises....unfortunately my set was
the last set he is ever gonna make. I slipped in just in time. The above
link makes the hoops also, but those are $350, and prolly will have to be
cut to be shipped to avoid a $100 ++ charge.  So your gonna have to roll
canvasless (is that a word?) or break open your piggy bank and give in. Of
course if you really want one but 750 or 900 is too much, you could have a
shop make you one custom and prolly drop 500 or so.

57 single



&gt;        Need the above for my 59 singlecab.   Looking for decent used
&gt;original if for a fair price.  Will be used as the flagship vehicle for my
&gt;moving company as a blanket and dolly truck.  I know about PLF;
&gt;better-than-original repros but very expensive.  Too bad about their silly
&gt;name...  please let me know of any leads- much appreciated...
