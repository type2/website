The runaway bus has happened to me a couple times;

Once right after I got it started for the first time; the cluctch was all
gummed up and I didn't realise the bus was in gear, so after running for a
while, the vibration finally engaged the clutch, and I had to stop it by
yanking the wires.

The second time, I was having starter problems; once again the bus was in
gear, and I was fiddling with the wires in the back, when the wires shorted
the starter and it started turning on it's own.  I had a by stander jump in
and hit the brake.
