 &quot;My starter now turns like crazy because i have both the 67 and 61 ground
  strap in place. (67 goes from front tranny mount to transaxle case, 61
  goes from rear tranny mount to starter bolt) I wouldnt doubt if half the
  starter problems in old busses are from bad or missing ground straps...&quot;
 
 Could it be that you placed a '61 (6-volt) starter on a  12-volt system? 
 That's the way my '64 Type 34 Ghia works. It originally had a 6-V starter on 
 it and I upgraded the battery system to 12-V, making it turn about twice as 
 fast. It doesn't hurt anything due to the short period of time that the 
 starter is engaged. My Type 34 has been that way for two years now, and that 
 is the &quot;standard&quot; way that things are done on Type 34's (otherwise one has 
to 
 switch out the flywheel on the Type 34; the 12-V flywheel isn't readily 
 available for a Type 34.)
