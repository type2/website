&gt; So if you are bound and determined to go this route, Joe is the man to
&gt; talk with. He is very happy to spend an hour on the phone with you, and
&gt; explain it step by step. Something you will not find with many vw

AMEN!  I have to completely concur.  I have never purchased a product with so
much before and after sales support from ANY vendor.  I don't even want to go
