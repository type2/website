i was just working on a few of the headligth switch and the flasher
switch...if i remember corrctly there should be a lead from the flasher switch
to that light. What i found weird about it is that there is only one lead to
the light, i guess it grounds it self by mounting to the dash.

I actually have a weird problem with my flashers...when i turn them on they
work fine, but if i step on the brake the warning lights in the speedo start
flashing and i think the gas gauge alternates between on and off...any ideas
on that one?
