&gt; Unless by &quot;torqued&quot; you mean overtorqued ie no end play.

&gt; applying torque to the shims - ie fully tightening the nut - deforms them.
&gt; you will never get an accurate end play reading from them after that.

Umm, how?  Unless the endplay is set to less than zero the shims should
not have any pressure on them at all.

Now, if the engine is run or the clutch depressed the shims will get
squeezed, and I've found that thin shims tend to get distorted.  For this
reason, I try to get a stack with two thick and one thin shim, with the
thin shim in the middle.
