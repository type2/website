John Howard, you have hit the nail on the head, and I sure can say that as
long as there are those who can hit that particular nail on the head, I'll
drive my ACVW with verve and vigor, and damn them torpedoes, anyhow!

Only one question:  What kind of beast does Kyle have?

Gene

&gt; As I sit here on my hands and grit my teeth  and type with a toothpick in
&gt; my mouth i wonder what the hell is going on. It is a wonder that so many
VW
&gt; buses are running. With all the what temp, what pressure, what tire size,
&gt; what trany gear, what rpm, it is weird that any are still running. Do like
&gt; volkswagen did and just run it. If the dash lights go on stop and check it
&gt; out. If Volkswagen thought real gauges were needed they would have put
them
&gt; in. JUST DRIVE YOUR BUS TO PRESCOTT THIS WEEKEND AND HAVE FUN. The world
&gt; would have been alot better without gauges, LONG LIVE THE IDIOT LIGHT!!!
&gt; Trust it. If not park your bus and enjoy looking at it. Pass me a beast
Kyle
&gt; and lets enjoy the weekend.
&gt;
&gt; John ( ass already been flamed so you cant hurt me ) howard
