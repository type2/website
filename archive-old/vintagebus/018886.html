Hi list,
I haven't gotten any nibbles off of my last cast for a fuel pump rebuild
kit.
Any ideas on were I can land this fish?

&gt; I'm looking for two fuel pump rebuild kits: one for my 1961 40 hp Kombi
(stock)
&gt; and one for my 1967 1500cc Bug (stock).  There are two diaphragms per
each
&gt; pump - the main one and the cut-off diaphragm.
&gt;
&gt; I've seen the rebuild kits listed in the type 2 archives as:

&gt; PN 113-1927      Fuel Pump Rebuild Kit
&gt;             For Fuel Pumps:
&gt;             211-127-025 (40HP - Threaded inlet)
&gt;             113-127-025A or B

I'm trying Dworkin's bits

Will parts houses such as BFY respond to e-mail requests?

Also could the new bus topics stay on the vanagon list?
I don't see how it has any thing to do with a the purpose of this list..
at least wait until Friday?
