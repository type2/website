&gt;I also need to know what size resistor I should use for my 6V wipers to
&gt;function properly on 12V.  I'm not going to bother with the two speed
&gt;switch right now.  Just want to get them going at a proper rate.

Here are a couple of my earlier posts on this subject.  One is the
&quot;official&quot; way and another is the &quot;how can I make this work with
stuff I can buy at AutoZone at 7pm on Sunday&quot; way. 

Official way

Bentley specifies the single-speed wiper motor at 20 watts fully
loaded.  It also lists the system voltages of the various generators
at anywhere from 6.3 to 7.3V.

P=VI, 20=6.3I, I=3.2A .  V=IR, 6.3=3.3R, R=2.0 ohms.
P=VI, 20=7.3I, I=2.7A .  V=IR, 7.3=2.7R, R=2.6 ohms.

So, you'd need a resistor valued somewhere between 2.0 and 2.6 ohms
and rated 20 watts or better (25W and 50W types are commonly
available).   These resistors will generally be in a finned aluminum
housing that can be bolted down to a surface, or in a sand/ceramic
housing that mounts via its connecting leads.  The resistor WILL
get hot so be careful where you mount it.

4 of Radio Shack's #271-120 $1.49 (8 ohm, 20 watt) resistors in 
parallel might work.  Otherwise, order one from an electronics
supplier...prices in a couple of catalogs I have range from
$2.97/ea to $4.80/ea for 2.0 to 2.5 ohm, 25 and 50 watt resistors,
in the finned aluminum case.

Field repair

Per Bentley the 6v wiper motor draws 20 watts.  It occurs to me
that this is a decent match for both filaments of a 6v tail-light
bulb in parallel (1154, 16.8W + 5.3W = 22.1W) or just use the
bright filament to get a little more speed out of the motor
without hitting it with the full 12v.  What I'm trying to say is
that a tail light wired in-line in the wiper motor hot lead might
be a good field expedient replacement for a volt-a-drop.  The
bulb will light up and get warm, though, so you will want to
put it where it won't glare on the windshield or ignite anything.

Good luck!
