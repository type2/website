&gt;Let me know when were gonna talk about buses again. &lt;
If you have bus questions or experiences I am sure the list would be more
than happy to chat about them.

&gt;constant bickering and irrelevent subjects &lt;
Yes, there are some strong opinions on certain subjects that get heated
debate, but exchange of view point is what the 1st amendment is all
about.... Unless we are talking about David Horowitz(sp) which seems to have
had his rights revoked somehow, God forbid we have open minded discussion on
the lunacy of reparations for slavery.  Some people convey their opinions in
ways that I would not, but that is not for me to police.

Hey life is full of irrelevant subjects just let them pass.  I could care
less about tear drop trailers, but for some it is very relevant.  Maybe we
should have a big government mediator come in a decide what is relevant on
the list?  Just because some list members do not like a subject does not
make it irrelevant for the list at large.

&gt;to much for this lurker to handle&lt;
This is getting to be a peeve of mine.  There seems to be people that lurk
and never contribute to someone else's problem, but yet ask questions of
these crazy topics and expect answers immediately and in infinite detail.
It only takes a few minutes to help someone out with a legit question, lets
make that effort and expand our bus spirit and community.  This list is not
an endless Giving Tree (remember the childhood book).  YOU are the list and
without everyone's contributions there would be a pretty weak list
community.  If you keep up with the list you definitely get more than you
give no matter how hard you try, but make an effort to give back when you
can.  How can there be hundreds of list members and I only see 10-20 regular
responders to questions?

If you do not like what is happening on the list do not be a quitter.  The
only rational solution is to follow in Barbara Streisand's footsteps and
write an irrational and factually unsupportable letter to the Democratic
leaders of America, LOL.  In fact I think I am going to call up Dennis
Rodman and see what he thinks about this whole disgruntled list member
issue...  Sometimes I slay me, LOL :)
