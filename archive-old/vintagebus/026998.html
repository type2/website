A couple that I missed...  Reply to jwalker_at_uronramp_dot_net


    FFFFFriday
 by Unca Joel

  hear i sit, all down-hearted,
  'tis Friday, and i can't get started.
  a story, joke, an ode or pome,
  i need to write, a little tome
  of wit or wisdom, mirth or glee,
  but nothing bubbles up from me.

  am i so burned from Fridays past
  that nothing's left in me at last?
  no more lame verse to mock our cars?
  no stupid songs unheard in bars?
  with wrinkled forehead o'er mine eyes,
  my tortured mind doth seek the prize.

  a silly song? no, not again.
  a sonnet, then, from way back when?
  an ode, perhaps? nah, that's too long;
  you're better off with silly song.
  oh, fuddled mind! am i too beat?
  is nothing left that ain't repeat??

  oh, well, it's not the worldwide end ...
  i guess, next Friday, try again
  to see if verse or song is writ
  continuing this Friday bit
  of Folly Funnies on the List ...
  and hope today it won't be missed.

  Blowing in the Wind
  by Bob Dylan Thomas Wolfe Blitzer &amp; Dasher &amp; Prancer &amp; ...

  Why does a bus weave all over the road,
  And never seem to stay in one lane?
  Yes, and why does it slow down so much on the hills,
  And make your job of driving it a pain?

 The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,
 The answer is blowing in the wind.

  And then why do those trucks seem to fly past your van,
  As you rock back and forth, side to side,
  And then why do the muscles in your arms and your legs
  Seem to ache at the end of your ride?

 The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,
 The answer is blowing in the wind.

  Why do you think, as you drive down the hill,
  That your speed is a bit more than norm?
  And then why do you think that rain jumps around
  On your windshield as your drive through the storm?

 The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,
 The answer is blowing in the wind.

  As you drive in your bus on the freeway at rush,
  How do you keep your anger subdued?
  Yes, and how do you calm all your innermost fire,
  When those boneheads are right in front of you?

 The answer, my friend, is driving with the Zen,
 The answer is driving with the Zen.

  And so how do you make up these silly old songs?
  And then how do the words find their way?
  Yes, and how does this happen each week after week,
  And always it seems on Fri-day?

 The answer, my friend, is going round the bend,
 The answer is going round the bend.

:)
