Hi VWbus,
Did you start to pull the window seal into the body frame at bottom center?  
If not you are pretty much guaranteed to shatter the glass due to the tapered 
shape of the window opening.  Plus using roofing tar as a sealant painted on 
the the body opening also lubricates the window seal and allows it to pop in 
way easier.  Eric&amp;Barb
