&gt; Another safety tip; if at all possible, have somebody with you.
&gt; I know there are emergencies and situations where we are working under less
&gt; than ideal conditions, but always keep safety at the top of your priority list.

Another tip, from Saint Muir himself.  If you must work under a bus only
supported by a jack on the roadside, or for extra safety in addition to
jackstands...

put whatever wheels you removed stacked under the bus....

that way if your support fails the wheels will keep the bus from crushing
you.

Also, i can fit easily under a bus on its wheels.  If i dont take the
wheels off im less concerned about dying, but its still better to use
jackstands. (if im flat on my back, im safe, but if im on my side and the
bus goes back down to its wheels im gonna get really hurt... unless im
lucky, which im usually not, hehe)

So in closing, if you take the wheels off PUT EM UNDER THE BUS WHERE THEY
CAN HELP YOU!

peas,

Steve

p.s. i carry a small floor jack and 2 jackstands in my bus as a safety
device as i may need to fix my vehicle or someone elses and i dont want
to get crushed...
