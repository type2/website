Subject: Re: [VB] 67 Doka - Master Cylinder &amp; M-Code

wow,?that truck has a lot of m-codes! 
Ten--- that is very impressive
220, isn't that limited slip differential, does it still have it?
(Many items get swapped out over 40 years)

list of M-codes:

The brake reservoir location is not stock for a split bus.?? I have seen that before once or twice, that people had modfied. A later 67 would have come with a dual master cylidner when new, but it is a one year only item so costs more, sometimes people install a different one.

The thingy on the gate is a step to help you climb into the bed.? Depending on the condition of you truck and the gates, it may not be s sturdy as it was 40 years ago when the truck was new, so you may, or may not, choose to use it.
It is a standard item, and not an M-code item

looks like the # in the lower corner has an extra digit... (71461912) shoud be 7 digits there, it has 8
