Subject: small nuts for sale in OR
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I bought this tranny a year or so ago from jack maynard when he posted it to 
the list. I ended up putting a big nut tranny in the bus I bought it for. It 
was sold to jack as working, but is untested by him or me. I think I have $75 
in it, so thats what I would like to get out of it. p-mail if interested.
