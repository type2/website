Hi - has anyone had any luck putting in the small skylight windows in
non-skylight busses? I would love one each by the front seats in my
westy (blasphemy?) My question would be whether the difference in
headliners from the Westy (grey board) to the deluxe (material) would
matter as well as who would do a good job with regard to the bodywork in
the midwest (any bodywork for that matter near Minneapolis).

Were these windows ever available in non-deluxe busses as an option? An
M-code?

Hope all are having a great summer bussing! - Tim in Minneapolis

p.s. still looking for a rear passenger-side over rider and bow.
