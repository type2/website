&gt;Does anyone know what kind of bags the tent and poles came in for a
&gt;driveaway tent? Did they vary by year?

I have a tattered blue cloth bag for mine -- it's not a duffle, but a bag you set the tent in and then flaps close over the top, sorta like closing a box.  Poles on mine came 
in an old army duffle, I think.

AFAIK I've never seen good pix of Driveaway tent or pole bags, but I'd guess they're not as stripey-colorful as the ones for earlier tents.  I stole a clue from Jim Ellis and 
carry my poles rolled up in a small tarp - removing them from the duffle was always a PITA.

There probably are year variations since the tent design was tweaked a few times.  I'd guess the bags were made from whatever was lying around.
