  There was a guy at BBBV who auctioned off the bay 
window bus he used to make a similar trip. It had a gull 
wing cargo door and vinyl, removable side doors. The 
back end got a baja treatment. I remember his orange, 
fake fur pants vividly.
  This type of bus would be great for that trip, totally 
utilitarian, functional, and with looks that people 
won't be as likely to kill you to steal. Which is why I 
would avoid taking a bus you are attached to or is nice 
looking.
  Maybe someone has pictures and more info?

a friend has proposed driving to Argentina from the US
(texas), sometime next
year. another friend says impossible....you'll never 
make it through columbia,
and there are impossible deserts to cross...

he has an aircooled corvair van, and i have the '65 
kombi. we are both
thinking that the vw would be better suited, due to 
parts being more easily
accesible, but his van's engine might be more 
durable....anyway i said i would
ask the list...

has anyone ever done something like this?
