correction - it has a pop top that *appears* to be a westy but aftermarket =
camper kit-=20

you can see it at http://thesamba_dot_com/vw/type2/ click on campers and go to =
page 6 near the bottom. it is listed as being owned by matt and katie.

if you did have a slider door you would have to give up the much sought =
after spice rack and pop out table

isn't there a velvet green westy on the samba with sliding door- dunno if =
the westy kit is from the factory or a later addition?

As I sit here (working hard) I was struck with a
question: Has anyone ever seen a Westfalia with either
a sliding door or double doors? I would guess that if
they do exist, they would be pretty rare or I am just
hitting the wrong shows!

65 Westfalia
