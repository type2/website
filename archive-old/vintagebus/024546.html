Subject: LOOSE HEADS (CONTINUED)

Ok.  A while ago I was asking for advice about why the heads on my 1600
sp kept loosening up.  I got several replies about the studs pulling out
of the cases, unless case savers were installed.  I'm getting ready to
pull the engine to (once again) torque the heads.  Whilst I was
underneath getting everything unhooked, I removed the tin under the
heads and looked.

Sure as kids eat bugs, there were case savers installed in the block!  

I don't believe in the band-aid approach, so I'd rather not go the
locktite route if I can help it.  I torque as per St Muir's directions,
pattern and all.  I torque gently and lovingly and spread the settings
over several increments, as I learned wrenching on a certain German make
of motorcycles.

So now I'm back to why are the heads loosening up so often?  

My driving habits aren't severe.  Much around town where the oil temp
stays below 180.  On the highway (50 - 55 mph) oil temp gets up to 210 -
215 and no higher.

I don't put that many miles a week on her, maybe 100 per.  I would like
us to get past this before x-mas so we can go do Disney in the bus.  The
familymobile's getting kinda cramped with growing kids and the menagerie
and the entire house packed into what little space there is.

So again, any suggestions, pointers, or incantations most welcome!

Dave
