You know, I'm all for what Thom is thinking of doing.  In fact I have a factory
book I
looked heavily in to copying, sorry to all those who asked for a copy.  I
still have all your addresses if I decide to do it.

All things I found about copy write led me to believe that VW still has the
copy write on all of their manuals.  With the way VW has been harassing
anything with a VW on it, I personally don't want to take the risk.

That said, I think in practice small duplication would not raise the sleeping
giant.  Or they could be reading this right now.  But, I guess since you guys
are bank rolling Thom's defense fund, go right ahead Thom copy away.  BTW
reserve me a copy ;-)  !!  Also, I'm  paranoid not a lawyer. :-)
