&gt;&gt;  I have the lockout plate with the ridge on the passenger side and the 
slope  forward. &lt;&lt;
Hi Rob,
Good!

&gt;&gt;  Is there a spacer underneath the lockout plate?  &lt;&lt;
No.

&gt;&gt;  I spent lots of time trying to get it to go but it  won't.  All other 
gears will engage.  Also, the early shifters have  aren't peened right?  &lt;&lt;
Try shifting the bottom of the shifter to the right slightly bit by bit and  
see if reverse is then available.  Not sure what or where you mean by  
&quot;peened&quot;, but no as far as we know.
