Dear Metal Wizards......

Getting ready to work on the wifes '67 21 window again.
Last time I left off (last summer, a long, long time
ago....) on it I had pulled out the only dent it had.  The
PO had back up in his hilly yard one day, and with no
brakes, ran it backwards into an oak tree.  The passenger
rear corner was bent in about 3 or 4  inches for about a
foot.  I pulled it out by tack welding my  come-a-long to it
with the other end on a telephone pole in my front yard.
I've found this works a whole lot better than one of those
sliding dent puller things.  Well, it worked as usual, but
now the metal is stretched and the corner is now slightly
bowed out more that the rest of the body.   My question
is... how do you get it back in??  I mean, how do you deal
with stretched metal like this?  Ive been thinking about
this for about a year now and still havent come up with a
good idea.  Only thing I can think of is to make a slice in
it with a metal blade in my skill saw, bring the resulting
ends back together somehow and then mig weld it.  This way I
could get rid of some metal.  I would really hate make a cut
like this and Im also not looking forward to replacing the
entire corner.  Any ideas?

Thanks in advance,

Gerald
