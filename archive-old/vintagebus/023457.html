NQ,

As you are talking about the gauge -- a new part that is currently sold, and
never actually came with the VW... you might be best to talk to a VDO dealer
(VW FLAPS).

Or check the bay window list... if you are 12 volt, then they are much more
likely to know the answer (putting a VDO Royale gauge on a stock bay
window... which of course would have a bay window tank and sending unit).

Okay everyone, I checked the archives and previous email posts and can't
find the answer.  Will my baywindow sending unit work with those royale
guages that VDO makes?
