&gt; dealing with the run in the acrylic enamel - I'm sure urethane will harden way
&gt; way faster but ... how fast?

When my urethane was applied, there was a small run on the roof - the shop
took care of it within the week. The urethane has proven to weather very
well. Before it was bought, I was told that it would last at least 12
years in the sun without wearing significantly. Mine was done 8 years ago,
and it's spent the last 3 years in the sun without garage, here in
SoCAL, and it still looks really new. It took about 6 months to really
cure and harden, before it was resistant to laquer thinner.
