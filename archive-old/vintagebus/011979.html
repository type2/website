&gt;There are two paper gaskets. One goes on top; the other goes on the 
bottom of the screen, sandwiching it. Then you slide it up into the 
engine and put the backing plate on. Torque the nuts onto the plate at 7 
ft/lbs. Yes, SEVEN. If you tighten these too tight, you'll pull the 
studs right out of the case...also, when the engine heats up, the metal 
will expand, creating a much higher torque than 7 ft/lbs. An even 
torquing and a clean cover plate (and clean case where the gasket meets 
the engine) are your best bets for getting a good seal. I *do* put oil 
on the gaskets, but some volks don't. I wouldn't recommend gasket sealer 
there because it's a real pain to clean off.
&gt;

I would look at the sump plate. Is it flat and I mean flat? Are the 
holes ovaled? I have sanded some of them to get a nice surface.

 And here I go wanting to get flamed...I use a gasket sealer. I use one 
that wont attach to the metal permanantly. I coat the paper real thin 
all the way around and the edges. I let it sit until the NEXT change, 
then do another. This way it is dry, but has sealed the paper. Think 
thin, thin, thin, coat of sealant.



&gt;I use Castrol too. I use different viscosity depending on the time of 
year.
&gt;

Ok my bent on this.... I use recycled oil ONLY. I recycle my oil and 
hopefully everyone else does too. To close this loop we need people to 
use these kinds of products. I feel that if the oil can earn the 
starburst symbol of being ready for engine use (again) it is good 
enough. Remember that we replace our oil many more times than a modern 
car would. This gives me less worry, because the oil isn't in there very 
long. Besides, 80,000 miles on my engine that has been through all the 
worst I can throw at it is a good indicator that the oil aint bad!
