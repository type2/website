I would have to aggree, although there are times when ive broken the rule.
Its usually just for a day or two.
I had was my 67 beetle with no motor for about three weeks parked ont he 
street.
But atleast it was a complete, registered, tagged and license plate wearing 
vehicle.
Ignore the broken rear window and fact that it looked like it caught on 
fire....wait...looked, it did! (not by me!)
That was three weeks.
I've parked my 57 in the driveway for a month without moving it. (The garage 
was full of reminents of my 58 standard)
Although is that any worse that my neightbors motorhome?
or my other neighbors boat?
I dont think so.
And they NEVER complain!
Even when i had a roof of a bus in the driveway! (Waiting to get picked up by 
the shipping company)

&lt;&lt;This subject has come up before, and I'm willing to bet that the 
discussion will be the same as it was before.

Look at it from the other side.   While people with &quot;projects&quot; in the
driveway may think they're beautiful, the rest of the neighbors call
a spade a spade: it's a non-running, rusting hulk.  I don't care if it's
a '96 taurus or a '41 schwimmwagen.  If it's sitting in the driveway rusting,
with pieces missing, and doesn't run, it's *junk*, irrespective of it's
potential as a classic.

I'm a project car kind of guy, yet I would still object to some POS 
dismembered in a neighbors driveway.   You could drive right past my house
and not know I had a project going on unless I had the garage door open at
that exact moment.

And where is it stated that people have a &quot;right&quot; to a junk vehicle?

People do not realize that having a project car comes with a responsibilty
to keep things somewhat neat.  The basic rule of thumb is to keep
your house no worse than your neighbors.  If all of your neighbors have
junk cars on the lawn, then you can too.  If they don't, you shouldn't.
If you do not like conforming to the de facto standard of the rest of the
neighborhood - MOVE.  Find a neighborhood where everyone has their cars on
blocks and feel at home.  Or rent a shop in an industrial area,
where you can rip stuff apart any time of day or night and nobody will
give a damn.  Go in on the rent with some buddies, and you can have a grand 
old time.

A project also brings with it the responsibility, although somewhat vague,
that you'll actually do something with it.  To collect a bunch of 
&quot;cars&quot; and not do anything with any of them is more along the lines of
&quot;hoarding&quot; than &quot;restoration.&quot;
