Hi list,

Can anyone tell if bus exhausts differ internally from beetle ones? Can one
weld up one of the holes in a beetle silencer and use it on a bus? I need to
replace my header system with a stock type exhaust so that I can run a
filter/pump*(the header almost touches the oilpump cover). Also the header
is so noisy that I risk being shot by one of my neighbours.

Later

Michael
