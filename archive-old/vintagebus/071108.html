Subject: Fuel Injection in a split

Hello all,
   This is Tim, I am at my parents now preparing a proper engine for
Clementine.  I still have to tune in the CB CFI but the engine is
running otherwise.  I had Ronnie send me what I needed (minus injection
and ignition) and I would like to say thank you to Ronnie for all the
help on the phone.  Now Clementine has a full flowed 1904cc with a C25
Scat cam, 041 heads, Magnaspark ignition, and an Ultra competition fuel
injection system from CB performance (I decided to get the four sensor
system on Ronnie's suggestion, it has a map sensor in addition to
cylinder head temp, intake air temp and throttle position sensor.  Also
it has a three dial driver control module.)  I did have a few hang-ups
including no M12 case nuts in the hardware kit, and getting the wrong
size main bearings, but these were corrected very quickly by Ronnie
(overnight).  
            Unfortunately the mosquitos here in Oklahoma are getting
very large and plus the blister bugs have attacked me and I have a mass
of blisters on my right foot, so I am constantly slapping myself and am
working barefoot for comfort.  
Luckily I was born into a family of mechanics and if my brother and dad
can't lick it, it can't be done.  So I got the engine assembled from
boxes in about four days (including waiting for overnighted parts)  with
a little help from the hillbillies.  As my brother says, &quot;we're so far
out in the woods you have to drive back towards town to go hunting.&quot;  
 
I believe this engine will make me spoiled, Clementine too.
 
I had thought I would be on the road by now, but now I think I will be
headed north in about a week after I have some time to break-in the
engine and set the fuel injection up.  My thoughts on the CB kit so far
is that it is worth the money and includes everything you would ever
want (except for a case cover for the mechanical fuel pump and I needed
an extra tee for the MAP sensor).  
     I have always wanted a clean engine and now I have mine, there is
something about hearing an engine you assembled roar to life (mainly
roaring because I didn't have the manifold preheaters sealed off yet.)
oh I almost forgot I also mounted a bay gas tank in my bus for the extra
capacity during the trip.  (and yes Karl, the tank worked perfectly,
sorry that I didn't get back to you, I have been very busy)  So now my
engine compartment is detailed, stuffed with gas, and holds the engine
of my dreams.  
 
More details as I have them.
          Tim Johnson
                And
          Clementine
