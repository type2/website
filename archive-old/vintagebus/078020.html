Subject: Re: nosecone bushings

&gt; From: rexrogers_at_type2guy_dot_com
&gt; Any tips on removing the bushings from the nosecone? I tapped on the
&gt; inside lip of each with a screwdriver and no dice.

I used a pin punch with a very sharp edge.  IIRC one of them came out 
easily and the other was a real bear, had to totally wreck it to get it 
out.  E&amp;B's method definitely sounds less painful if you can get to a 
lathe, but I was able to remove mine with hand tools.  Good luck!

I bought the replacement outer bush with the oil seal and it was pretty 
loose.  Ronnie gave me the idea of shimming its OD with strips from a 
beer can; with the RTV sealant it's been leak-free since installation 
as far as I can tell.
