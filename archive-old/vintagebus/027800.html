Hi all,

With all this talk about trailer hitches, is there an address for a photo
available somewhere of this &quot;round-tube&quot; type of hitch.  I happen to have a
complete hitch that sounds just like that down in my basement that I've had
stored away forever.   A photo reference would verify that.  I know it's a
VW hitch, because many years ago I saw a sales illustration of the hitch
from a very early VW accessory booklet.  It was illustrated on a
&quot;Split-window&quot; Beetle, but I think the hitch fit on either the Beetle or
the Bus.  I still have a photocopy of that page of the accessory booklet
somewhere around here.  Now you've got me curious!

By the way, does anyone have a complete &quot;round&quot; bulbholder/taillight
housing in decent condition to be used on our &quot;new-to-us&quot; 1959 Double Door
Panel Bus, soon to become the &quot;Busses Nowhere Near The Arch&quot; event vehicle?
 If so, please e-mail me privately to describe it and let us know what
you'll need to part with it.  The two that came with the Bus are really
more like 1 1/2, so I'll try to save one of them, but I'll need to add one
more.  I'll mount the repro plastic lenses and some used chrome bezels I
have to 'em, so all I really need are the taillight housing with good,
complete bulbholder.  Thanks for looking thru your stash!
