Subject: Re: [VB] Hubcap Emblem Paint
	charset=&quot;Windows-1252&quot;

I dunno all i did was put a bunch of 1 inch masking tape strips across it,
then took a exacto knife and cut out the logo and shot paint. looked perfect
*especially* at close up and was super easy. I think its the best way to do
it if you have weak corners on your logo cause you can float that Xacto
right in the center of the corner. Of course you will see tall edges if you
put the paint on too thick,  so be careful. but its all inside corners/edges
so it wont really be noticeable.
I clear coated mine after i was done with the  emblems.

&gt;&gt; What is the best method of repainting the VW enblem onto the hubcaps
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I freehanded mine, and it looks pretty good. You can tell that it was done
&gt;by hand if you get down on your hands and knees and look closely, but from
a
&gt;distance it looks great. It takes a long time freehanding it, but then so
&gt;would masking it off.
