I usually buy Craftsman. Good selection, reasonable price and a guarantee you can not beat.

The best tool I ever bought came from Sears. A 8 ton floor jack. I went for the best one because I did not plan to ever buy another and there was some money. Now thirty years later (dated aren't I?) it needs a rebuild and I still haven't been billed for that particular card purchase.

Like I said, &quot;best tool I've ever bought&quot;.
