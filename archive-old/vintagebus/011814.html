I am willing to sell the bus for $2250. It is a 67 camper with much $
invested. Low miles on rebuilt engine some rust but overall a good
polyurethane paint job-blue, clean interior. custom bed. 
We spent our honeymoon in this van and just want to find a good home for it. I
can no longer take care of it due to a back injury. Thanks!
