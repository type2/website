The plate I found in the engine compartment in the '63 is exactly the
same as the one I found in the M-plate location under the passenger seat
in the '67. The chassis numbers even match up on both of them to the
numbers stamped on the cars. It is a little 2&quot; x 3&quot; plate Which made me
initially think that this was the M-code plate.  If this isn't the
M-plate then what the hell is it?  Do you folks in the U.S. have one or
is this possibly the Australianism of the M-code plate?

sounds like a vin plate- like you say  like the ones in the ngine compartment
of the earlier buses or on the overhead air vent on the later splits.
aussies get no mcodes :(   ?

so do you have the plate also in both places in the 63?  is there one on the
air vent in the 67?
