Mine rubbed on the carb fuel solenoid and came close to wearing a hole in
itself.  The plastic was &quot;crazed&quot; around the wear spot, indicating to me
that it could have cracked easily.  Too close for me.  It only takes one,
and I don't want to be the one!

The other disadvantage to putting a filter in that location is that the
area over the distributor is one of the busiest locations on the engine.
It makes it harder to work on the carb, distributor, coil, brake vacuum
hose, or the filter itself.

&gt; ok kids, TIME FOR A POLL. how many of you have personally had a &quot;little
&gt; plastic fuel filter&quot; come apart and douse your engine.  PLEASE P-MAIL ME.
&gt; I'LL GIVE IT A WEEK AND REPORT MY FINDINGS.  i sold 1000's of these of all
&gt; kinds of manufacture, and have used 100's personally, and never had one
&gt; come apart, nor someone complain about it.  the only person who said this
&gt; happened to him was ed, neato pres (why didn't you vote), but he has his
&gt; own consipracy theory on that one.

&gt; &gt; Those little plastic filters between the pump and carb aren't all that
&gt; &gt; good of an idea.  They can break and douse the sparking bits of your
&gt; &gt; engine with gas.  They aren't all that good of filters anyway.
