Subject: Re: [VB] Clamp for Red. Box and spring plate...

I too suffer from the unfortunate affliction of collecting old VW tools, =
the words Hazet, Matra, Gedore, Stahl Wille sound familiar? I have been =
fortunate enough to meet some former dealership mechanics who have sold me =
their tool collections/fiche/fiche readers/workshop manauls as they have =
retired. Of course actually putting that knowledge /tools is another =
matter :)

Does anyone have a book/database that actually tells you what the various =
VW numbers stamped on the tool correspond to? I sometimes get tools that I =
have no idea what they were ever used for and only have a VW number to go =
by.

My most recent is a VW183. A large &quot;wrench&quot; made by matra that looks kinda =
like -&gt;    ^-- . hard to draw but obviously designed for a very specific =
purpose.

Would like to hear from fellow tool enthusiasts to fill in a few blanks.

Thanks

Hi all,

Man, I just LOVE vintage VW tools!  I've been collecting lots of actual VW
Factory special tools for quite some time now.  I've been able to aquire =
an
extensive collection of these very speciallized VW factory and dealership
service tools as seen in the Bentley Workshop manuals.  Having the &quot;exact&quot;
tool for a specific job really makes vintage maintinence a breeze!

So I noticed recently that someone asked if a 10&quot; clamp would do the trick
to clamp a Transporter spring plate tightly to the reduction box to help
avoiding the stripping of reduction box bolt threads.  If you aren't sure
what we're talking about here, staop and get out your copy of the early =
Bus
Bentley Workshop Manual (you do have one, DON'T YOU?) and turn to the
tranny section.  In my 1959 VW Transporter Workshop Manual, in the chapter
&quot;Rear Axle and Transmission&quot; (section &quot;H&quot;) in section H-2, page 1 you'll
see the correct clamp for this particular job.  There are several great
photos of a mechanic installing a very large &quot;bar clamp&quot; to squeeze the
spring plate tightly to the backside of the reduction box.  This prevents
the twisted spring plate from assisting you to cross-thread those four big
12mm bolts.  I believe that these photos are also in the same area of the
widely available Bentley reprint of the early '60's thru 1967 VW Workshop
Manual.

Check out those photos closely, and then cruise on over to your local =
Sears
Craftsman tool Dept.  Unless they are temporarily out, right there on the
rack in the Sears clamp section is almost the same tool!  Even better, =
it's
a quality clamp made in Germany by &quot;Bessey&quot;.  The one I bought has a 12&quot;
grip range and a 5 1/2&quot; depth range.  The Sears number off my sales =
receipt
is #9 31637.  The Bessey sticker on the orange wood screw handle says=20
TG5.512  (probably a Bessey part number) and on the metal slide bar it =
says
among other things &quot;maximum pressure 1320 lbs at 6 inches&quot;.  I bought this
in April 2001 and it cost $25.99.  It even has non-marring hard rubber
covers on the feet.  While I haven't had the opportunity or need to use =
and
test it as of yet, I took grip and depth measurements of my reduction
box/spring plate assembly as seen in those photos, and the 12&quot; x 5 1/2&quot;
clamp described above should do the trick nicely!  I'm not sure that a 10&quot;
clamp will be wide enough.

Well, I just thought a few of you might enjoy my discovery, so that you =
too
can add yet another newly made, but Vintage VW style tool to your bag of
mechanical tricks. =20

Good luck and happy wrenching!
