We just fixed up our bumpers on the '70. We were going to put a new/old 
bumper on the back, from Bus Depot, which would've been something like 
$140-$160 with shipping. I shopped for body shop work and found a place that 
would contract it out to a bumper specialist, for about $130, so that's what 
I did. Dunno how they did it, but it went from being sort of a pretzel to 
being immaculate and primed. The front bumper, I just banged out the dings 
and used bondo, and after priming and painting with Rustoleum glossy white, 
it's tons improved. 

Easier than all the molds, IMHO!
