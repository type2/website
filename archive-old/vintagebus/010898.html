Subject: Paint codes!

Last week I asked about paint codes
&amp; the pro's &amp; con's of two stage systems vs.
other method. Thom responded with code L31
and mentioned the system he has used with good
success. a single stage system.
What are the name's or types of products you
mentioned? I lost the e-mail with the info.

thanks.
