Subject: 1/3  2/3 seat cushion question
Message-Id: &lt;v03110701b30bc16c0f13_at_[38.28.68.49]&gt;

I have a 64 sundial conversion bus  with the 2/3's 1/3rd seats up front and
There is nothing left worth saving except the frames and springs. So my
question to you guys is whats the cheapest way to recover/cusion theese
seats and still have it look some what similar to stock (I like that look)
What do you guys suggest? What did you do?

Also on another note,
I may be getting a 77 westy with a thrown rod for dirt cheap ($100 bucks) I
was wondering if a junkyard type place will take your old engine and some
cash in trade for a rebuilt engine? Will they generaly do that kind of a
deal. I know that The junkyard near me (Bry's) Is always rebuilding old
engines. I suppose I would just call them but there closed right now. :-)
-- Related to this also is there any good resources on the net about
droping engines on bay's? I'm so sketchy with the later bus pancake style
engines.

thanks for all,
peace.
