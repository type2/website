&gt; &gt;&gt; Hi Jason,
&gt;&gt; Yes!  A nice 1300-1600cc muffler for bus.  You will not get the monoxide 
poisoning behind your bus like you will with the bug muffler or most 
extractor mufflers.  Also will run cooler, more torque which is most 
important for a bus and MPG than with the extractor.   Eric&amp;Barb  &lt;&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; I am in total agreement.  I tried the bug muffler on my bus and almost died 

&gt; from the fumes.  Use a bus muffler with the side exhaust pipe.  Spend the 
&gt; money and get a good German muffler.  It will fit and last.

&gt;&gt;Sorry my message didn't go to the list too, but you said it all anyway.

Hi Tim,
No problem we have forwarded it!  It is always good to hear from anybody who 
lived through a mistake and will still fess up about it!  Especially 
something as life and brain cell threatening as that.  Hopefully others will 
avoid situations like that upon reading.

There are generally three kinds of people out there:
Those who will make the same mistake over and over without ever learning.
Those who will learn from thier own mistakes.
Those who will learn from the mistakes of others.
