There are full flow pumps avaiable with a duel inlet/outlet cover on it, no
need to do anything except exchange the pump out.

Subject: [VB] Full Flow


Is it possible to install a full flow filter system on my 1600 while it
is still together?.....in the bus??  Can I drill and tap the case with
out getting metal shavings in the motor?   I'd like to put one on my
engine, but don't want to tear the motor apart again.  Its running
perfect and I don't want to tempt fate.
