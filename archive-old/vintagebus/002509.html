Subject: Site Update w/ NEW VW Designs
Date: Fri, 17 Mar 2000 08:27:51 -0800

Hi Everyone,

    With Spring just around the corner and flowers already blooming down
here in Central CA, I thought it was about time I upgraded my Nate's
WaterArt website with some new designs and some real photos.  If you like,
you can check it out at:

http://www.lemoorenet_dot_com/people/d/denate/nates.htm

    I'm now offering a wide selection of VW Bug, Bus (Vanagon coming soon)
and yes, even Westy designs along with my other non-VW selections.
Hopefully, there will be a little something for everyone's taste.  If you
don't see what you're looking for, just ask and I'll try and make it happen.
New designs w/ photos will
be added periodically as I get film developed and scanned it.  All our
sprinklers are now available as &quot;spinning&quot; designs as well and feature
silicone-bronze &amp; Teflon swivels that even have a grease fitting!!

    I will also give $5.00 off to all vintagebus_at_, type2_at_, vanagon_at_ and
wetwestie_at_ listees on every order to show my appreciation for all the
knowledge you've given me over the years.  Just be sure to let me know
you're a listee.

    For those on the left-coast, I'm planning to bring a small assortment of
my VW related designs (of course ;-) ) to Kelley Park &amp; Madera in April, and
several other shows throughout the show season.  That way you can check them
out  in person.  See you all out at the shows!!

    BTW, I've also fixed my Splitty page too, so it should be free of those
annoying blank boxes with little red &quot;X&quot;s ;-)  As you can see, I've been
hard at
work with my &quot;geek-hat&quot; on lately :-)
