I have used a product made by BG Products out of Kansas. It is a gear oil
additive, kind of like Lucas oil. I have put this in my RGB and trans and it
did help quiet down the 77 4th gear whine!

I want to know if anybody on this dead list has put synthetic gear oil
in a tranny and if you did, did it have any effect on the noise level of
the gearbox. I'm about to put some Redline MT90 in a tranny that has a
slight whine at about 50 mph. It's a fresh rebuild, so I'm not pulling
it. At least not until I have a better reason than a little noise.

Thanks
