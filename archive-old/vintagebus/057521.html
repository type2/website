Subject: Re: [VB] Bus tranny straps

You can use the bell housing strap with out a problem
but the smaller one near the nose cone won't fit. I
think the frame horns are bigger in a bus than they
are in a bug.
 You could always make them, I know I would want one,
as longs as they weren't solid mounts!
