What I meant was that I was just wondering if anybody has that same FI
engine installed in their bus with FI still attached to it. Just curious to
find out if there's more work required on conversion.

Thanks,

Andre

&gt; &lt;&lt;and that's what I've got. It's a 73 engine. I'm kind of toying with
&gt; the idea
&gt; of buying this bug that I've seen sitting in the mechanics lot which has
&gt; an
&gt; FI engine in it. Mechanic does not know how to work AC engines, admitted
&gt; to
&gt; me myself and poor owner want's to sell non running SB. $500.00 seems
&gt; too
&gt; high. I want to offer $200, see if it sticks and then somehow work the
&gt; engine into my bus. Can someone give me some feedback on this?&gt;&gt;
