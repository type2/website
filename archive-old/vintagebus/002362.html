twas rit&gt;  If you load it up and especially stop or turn suddenly you will
risk
bottoming out!  Plus the shocks you have look like they are for 65 and later
bug.  So they are too soft for a bus and the top mounts of these shocks are
completely differant from a bus top shock mount.  So you would have to cut
and weld a type 1 top shock mount on your bus front suspension to just get
them to fit.   Eric&amp;Barb


Thanks for the info.... however, the shocks feel way stiffer than the
'replacement' ones I got from BFY or WW or wherever...  Also, from looking
at it, all I would have to do to the front shocks is screw on an end like
the others and they would fit right on with out modifying anything on the
beam (but still 1&quot; or so too long).
