Ok, here's what I think.  I've seen a shorty split bus, bay window bus,
double cab, and now single cab.  Please, anyone that wants to do this to
their bus, just buy one of the ones that has already been done. I'm sure
anyone that has one of these will sell it after they realize just how bad
that they drive.

Stop the Carnage!!!
