Subject: '66 Decklid?
Message-ID: &lt;36FB8CE1.1AA0_at_piasanet_dot_com&gt;

I recently purchased a 66-67 decklid from RMMW only to discover it looks
like a real early decklid with the provision for the late thumb latch.
There's no debossed area above the license plate like my original lid
has. I guess those wacky hombres down south like to mix and match their
sheet metal dies, like splicing a bay window nose to a corner windowed
split body.

If someone out in List Land has a nice 66-67 decklid, please email. I
wouldn't mind sending the hybrid decklid back to the Rockies.
