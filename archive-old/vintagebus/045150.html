Hi Michael,
You really do not need to install tach.  Just wire one in for a half hour 
drive and have your passenger hold and write down RPMs _at_ MPH in each gear.  
We found this much more help and installing a tach a waste of time.  Plus it 
leaves you tach loose to do it's work on more than one VW.  If you are still 
worried about overrevving then get yourself a bus only manifold and govener 
for your sized engine.  This setup is adjustable for the RPM you want.
