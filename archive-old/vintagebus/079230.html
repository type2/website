&gt; Hi Audreyszabo,
&gt; Not safe, because the front seat then can come loose in an accident
&gt; especailly when rear ended.  It also does adversely affect the structure of the bus
&gt; body!  It does decrease the value, but a replacement piece can be easily welded
&gt; back in place.
&gt;

Makes me wonder if this Camper is a flip seat westy,,, it would be almost worthless,, give me a
call and I'll have it picked up and taken care of....
&lt;grin&gt;

seriously,, did they make a flip seat in 59,, remind me,, were they walk thru or bulkhead buses?
