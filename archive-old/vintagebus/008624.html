&gt; My Bus appears in VW Trends this month too, pictured in the coverage of
&gt; last year's Jerome caravan.

And if you read the story about Jerome, it says the raffle winner of the bus
also bought Jim and Ellis's Puck trailer!
Jim and Ellis???
I think the story was written by Uncle Jerry, but he couldn't have said 'Jim
and Ellis', could he?
