Subject: Hoover Serrmons!

I have my Hoover sermons up and running! 
Woo Woo!

Nice job of editing and presentation!  I really like the Adobe format.
Very easy to search.

I challenge everyone to search ( when you get yours, that is) for the
comparison Bob makes between St Muir and his grandmother! I about died!

This disc is cheaper than a Muir manual by $5. And worth about 1000
times as much.
The only addition I would make is to add some diagrams. 

Oh, and the introduction by Bob hisself is worth the price of admission.
