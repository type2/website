Westfalia is a passenger bus, check the california license plates.

So then it would be safe to assume that a Kombi would fall under, which
class?  I guess it's a commercial bus, afterall it has the black vent
latches.  But it was destined as a passenger bus on it's way to the
Westfalia factory to get dressed up.  ???

All I know is my Westy had all Sigla glass and *on top* front slider
latches as there were no signs of any of these things being changed by a
P.O.
