VanBondo has been silent for too long! I finally got my computer fixed on
Sat 09/05/98. Upgraded to Win 98. I would NOT recommend the &quot;Nuts and Bolts&quot;
software to anyone. I swear that it was the culpurit of my latest troubles.

VW CONTENT:
I sadly missed the Pre-Jerome &quot;Tech day&quot; at the local FLAPS. I needed help
with my braking system  on the rat '63 EZ camper. I will be driving it or
the '54 Ambu-camper to Jerome.

The AZ Motor Vehicles Department absolutley flipped out over the title to
the Denmark bus. I had it inspected at the cross-town inspection station on
Tuesday. I had switched the Euro-fluted non-sealed headlight buckets for the
US spec 6V ones. Flatly lied about the US spec glass and was able to prove
existence of seat belts. The MVD desk jockeys kept me at the service desk
window for nearly an hour while they went through progressive layers of
Managers in an attempt to ID the title. There was no English word on the
thing! It was all in Dannish/Dutch. =) ROTFLMAO. Paid $3.00 extra dollars
and retained the original title. Commuter traffic was &quot;F&quot;ed up due to the
Barn putting home. hahahahaha.
I gotta get some sleep. See you all at Jerome. Look for either the Barndoor
or the rat 63...
