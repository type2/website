&gt; I am just curious how to get the seam apart all 
&gt; the way around, what types of welds and such. It sounds like removing all 
&gt; the metal would make it alot ea
&gt; 
&gt; Got an air chisel?  You can cut the corner off in chunks, the main thing 
&gt; here is visibility.  Lets start at the top.  Cut across the corner about an 
&gt; inch below the rain gutter and then cut down the side of the corner about 
&gt; an inch away from the seam.  When you come to the rear floor and the 
&gt; reinforcing cut across staying about an inch away from it, you'll also do 
&gt; same at the left (for lack of a better word) battery tray.  So here you sit 
&gt; with 3 large holes where your corner used to be, looks sort of like a cut 
&gt; away drawing.  Now to get rid of the rest of it.  Get a Scotch Brite wheel 
&gt; and clean the metal on the corner side of the seams, this will show you 
&gt; where the spot welds are.  The problem with drilling spot welds is it takes 
&gt; a while and then you have to go back and grind them down to get rid of the 
&gt; extra metal.  An old body man about 30 years my senior showed me a little 
&gt; trick.  Skip the spot weld drilling all together and just grind down the 
&gt; spot welds till you see a small circle in the metal, your done!  A pair of 
&gt; vise grips and you can spin the metal of the seam, sort of like opening a 
&gt; can of Spam.  3 M makes a grinding wheel about an 1/8 of an inch wide which 
&gt; fits most wheelie cutters.  You can also use this trick on the outside of 
&gt; the left battery tray and areas where you just can't get a drill and spot 
&gt; weld bit.
&gt;                                                                    Peace,
&gt;
