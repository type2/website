&gt;The bulb that fits in the bucket is a 3 prong so that just plugs in.
&gt;But on the bucket, where the bulb fits in there's 2 additional
&gt;electrical connections.

Could they be connections for a parking light?  I know on sealed-beam
Buses the parking light socket goes in the rim, in front of the
headlight.  I haven't ever seen a euro Bus headlight assembly up
close, but I have seen a '76 BMW motorcycle headlight assembly and
it is kind of like what you have: there's a big hole in the center
for the bulb and a small socket with connections just below that
for the parking light bulb.

They also might be some kind of retainer for the bulb.
If you find out what they are, let us know.

Matt Roberds
