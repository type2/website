&gt; When I tested the fuse box yesterday it was really hard to get a reading on 
&gt; my Voltmeter so I think dirty connections and some bad wiring are causing

Hi Rex,
If it is a screw connector fuse box while you have it out solder the riveted 
connections on its front side to help prevent voltage resistance.  If it is 
the 1961 and later fuse box solder the brass clips that are slipped into the 
fuse box together!
