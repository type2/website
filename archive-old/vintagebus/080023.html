&gt; depends the year of your beam... does your bus have
&gt; the easy pry off dust 
&gt; caps with the lip or the non lippy kind?
I'm the non-lippy type although my posts to this list
can be sarcastic. The dust cover went into the
brake-drum straight and I used a big channel lock to
pry it off. Things look nice and fresh in there; wheel
bearing grease still fresh looking from when I put new
bearings in before my last California to mid west
trip.
Its going to be hard for me to get back into the VW
lifestyle again the only thing I've been doing with
the bus is live in it while i build my cabin now I'm
driving the  Kombi again because the farm truck broke
it's frame and blew the engine. There's a 1 1/16th
wrench i can buy _at_ the salvage store and grind down to
the suitable with.
