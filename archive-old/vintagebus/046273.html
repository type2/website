i have been pulling my hair out trying to find a short or shorts in Sparky,
my '60 Panel.   By the kindness of Jason, I made sure all the wires were at
the proper location on the fuse box.  I then used a multi meter to help
isolate the source.  I have located tow spots so far, the wire to the coil
and the one to the starter.  I also have not been able to get the lights
working either.  I am about to pull the whole thing out and install a new
one from RMMW.  How hard is that to do?  Any suggestions from the list?  I
am sorry if there is not enough info, my brain is fried!

well, maybe your ignition switch is bad.  Pull the switch out, disconnect the
wires from the switch, and hotwire it.      Switching the entire wiring
harness sounds like a lot more work than you need to do.   

I had some wierd stuff going on in my 59 truck, and when the gas guage was
disconnected the wierd stuff went away.   Electricity stretches my brain, so I
try to keep everything asap (as stock as possible) in the wiring, or revert it
to that, even if I replace something I like to use original colours- brown for
ground etc.   Red is always hot, black hot with ignition on.   dash lights get
white with red stripes.   So it all should make sense.    Some one had posted
a  list of what he numbers on the switches mean- for all bosch systems.   Very
cool, I have it somewhere.

hope this helps.
