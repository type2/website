Subject: john morris (the PA one) and more leakage.

First order of business...
Calling John Morris....John Morris... to the keyboard please.  I forget
what your email adress is... I talked to you at the campground at
Detroit... remember...Jaime Rivers pulled out his neat little laser
temperature thing?? hehe  anyways...if you're the John Morris from
PA...please email me.

2nd order of bidness
Anyone wanna buy a nice 62 bus??  cheap! otherwise I'm hauling it in for
scrap value tomorrow!!





JUST KIDDING!
anyways...
the derned thing keeps on leaking... drip drip drip
The motor will come back out tomorrow and I'm going to have to mess with
the flywheel thing again.  It was of my own ignorance that I made the
mistake...I think I have an o-ring flywheel and I never installed an
o-ring...and now she's leakin something fierce....there wasn't one in
there before...but thats probably why it was leakin eh?!
so tomorrow will be fun...

As far as my generator light goes... I slapped on a brand spankin new
belt today...and nothing changed.  I snapped the clips that are on the
brushes (as in lifted them up, and let them go so they snapped on the
brushes) and I even removed the brushes.  They still have plenty of wear
left in them...so I don't know why the generator would go kaput.  The
generator was brand new 40,000 miles ago...and I know that most
generators live far beyond that.  A buddy of mine (Hey Billy!!)  (he's
reading this ;-) stopped over tonight and snapped the brushes while I
was sitting in the front watching the light.  It flickered when he
snapped them...but then just went back to keep on glowing. soo....I
don't know what the deal is yet.  The battery has a *tinch* over 12V
left in it after driving about 80 night time miles since it went out...
(yeah..driving with an oil soaked clutch and a glowing gen light is
bad...no flames please...I kept my eye on the oil like a good little boy
should) and I have no decrease in how bright the lights are or anything
like that...and the battery still has plenty of juice.  While we had the
multimeter on the battery..I fired up the engine and revved it while we
watched the meter.... it didn't really fluctuate much...and it didn't
rise at all.  If anything..it went down a tad.  so......I don't know
whats going on yet.  I've a few voltage regulators that I'm going to
test out tomorrow.  (poor Stella sacrifices her battery for poor Isaiah
to use in his &quot;new-fangled toy&quot;)

anyways...thats the jist of things now...  more updates
tomorrow...hopefully...if I can get my lazy arse outta bed.

adios
