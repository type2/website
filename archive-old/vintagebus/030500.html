The best protection for the roof rack feet and clamps is to go to the hardware store and look
in the tubing section. I believe it is 1/4&quot; but it is clear vinyl tubing that has something to
do with ice makers or something. Cut this to the length of the feet and slit it down the
middle. You can then slide it on the feet, do the same for the ends of the clamps. It is clear
so it does not show that much. You can change them easy if they get dingy looking and they are
thick so you will not wear through them. I have seen no paint damage with this system, just
make sure all surfaces are clean when you put the rack on and off.
hope this helps,
