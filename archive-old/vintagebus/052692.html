Micheal,List,
       I have put on rockers from RMM before, and agree, they aren't very 
good, and look to be &quot;seconds&quot; in my opinion.  (ie: the cargo door rocker 
didn't have the intermediate rocker attached like factory, and the piece 
behind it, to the fender well, actually was a bay window part, not spittie, 
wrong lip at the end)  I have put on &quot;many&quot; rockers that came from BFY 
though, both sides, and they are cheap, and fit rather nice for the price.  
Seems to me that it all has to do with the manufacturer that the parts house 
gets them from.  My favorite rust repair panels, for the price mind you, are 
the Orange panels, not sure where those come from, and thats the kind BFY 
sells.  My experience, take it for what it is, is that &quot;NO&quot; rust repair 
panels fit perfectly...  You gotta &quot;massage&quot; them into place.  

       Be sure to use a MIG welder and don't warp your bus, especially the 
drivers side when you put it on, or your body man will hate you!  Spot weld 
it, no solid welds there!  Wait along time in-between welds, use an air gun 
to help cool the metal after you weld it, and do it over an entire 
afternoon...
