Subject: Re: [VB] VW Photo Jam

You've got some good points. I wasn't aware it's used by 
worms or that it is spyware. If so, downloader beware of 
this and any other browser add-on. 
You are captain of your PC just as your bus. (Unless it 
belongs to your employer, take pity on the long-
suffering support staff) Know what you are doing to it.

&gt; It's interesting, from an artsy perspective, but it required me to load
&gt; stuff to my P/C which smells a little of spyware.  I can't save it
&gt; (ie so I can upload it to vintagebus_dot_com) without getting (ie buying)
&gt; something called &quot;shockmachine&quot;.  I view the whole thing as an attempt
&gt; to subrogate the browser model.  
&gt; 
&gt; Shockwave and Flash movies are also transport mechanisms for viruses.
