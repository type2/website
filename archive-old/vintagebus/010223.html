Well if you know much about about Guatemala, you know it has a lot of german
influence. They own a great deal of coffee land there.  There are lots of
german made buses there, especially single cabs.  And also there are a lot
of abandoned westys, from the US(damn hippies driving down without a clue or
spare parts) Of course you see the mexibus, and the wierd brazilian ones
with the corner windows too. In the smaller towns the &quot;bomberos&quot; (firemen)
use them, i had a friend that was saved by one once. Anyway, does it make a
difference in importing a car if it is german made? Does anyone know about
how much the fees(not including shipping) would be to import a nice bus?
