Anyone ever have any experience with oil slinging past the oil slinger
washer, hitting the pulley and making a nice mess of the motor?  This is a
sudden development on a normally reliable 1600 dp with about 11K on it.  Any
ideas how to fix?

the motor in my 61 m130 deluxe has a slight leak around the crank pulley.
Enough to be irritating, but not enough for me to have done anything about.
but that has been doing that since the motor was buildt.   A sudden leak...
hm.   How much oil are you losing in how long?    you may want to pull he
rear tin and the crank pulley and replace it.  not fun,  but  could fix that
leak.   try to use the largest pulley available (there are at least 5 or 6
stock sizes) for max cooling per engine turn.
