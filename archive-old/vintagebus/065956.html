This is starting to sound like my bus when I last drove it on the
street some 12 or so years ago.

When I took it to get inspected, the guy pulled it into the service

He yelled, &quot;Get this piece-of-sh!t VW out of my garage!&quot;

I drove it home, into my garage and spent nearly an hour telling my
bus, &quot;It's OK, he didn't mean it... He's just a grumpy Chevy owner.&quot;
