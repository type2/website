&gt;  Maybe, Tom would consider making up a materials list and measured
&gt;  drawings.   I'm sure people would love it.  I know I'd pay for a set.  Of
&gt;  course we take on all liability for the contraption and leave Tom absolved
&gt;  of any liability.

I never really thought of the getting crushed thing before.  Well I guess 
when I get right underneath for some reason, like to pick up some tool or 
part that has dropped down there, I think about it.  We all think about 
weather the jack stands are up to it when we are starring up at the bottom of 
the engine or tranny trying to get to the clutch cable or whatever.  Hell yes 
we got to be safe.

Really it is pretty safe for two reasons: 1) the whole idea is that you can 
stand up and work on whatever part at work bench height besides the bus not 
under it, and 2) I know that is is safe and the welds are strong.  We all get 
a feeling if something is strong or week, just common sense.  When you are 
welding 3/8 inch thick steel, you can make a heck of a strong weld.

I am willing to share whatever folks want to know.  I kind of just built it 
from an idea in my head.  I don't have any measured drawings, and I kind of 
don't really have the urge to do them.  Here are some materials I used:

Two Northern Hydraulics (www.northerntool_dot_com) jacks #12484 7000pund capacity 
$70
Four Northern Hydraulics (www.northerntool_dot_com) pneumatic swivel casters # 
18977 capacity 625 pounds $36
[I choose pneumatic since my outside area is gravel - I would go with solid 
casters if its always going to be on concrete slab]
Lots of 2-1/2 inch square steel tube 3/8 inch thick wall
Lots of 5x5x1/4 inch steel plates with 5/8 holes puched in each corner
Lots of 1/2 bolts with nuts for the plates above
Four 1/4 inch steel plates to make anchor plates that attach to the bus.

If anyone has any questions or wants me to take some close up pictures of 
some specific area, let me know.  I am glad to share.  That is what the list 
is about.  Remember that the detail shots on the web page are thumbails and 
click on them to see them full size.

Next week, how to make your own nuclear device without liability.  First go 
to Wal Mart and get some of the refined plutonium, or uranium if you are on  
a budget.....
