Hi Thom,
Yes, it will do it!  We did it with our 1960 panel camper with big bore 40 HP 
engine and low stock gearing and suspension/brakes in our hilly PNW.  The 
main danger other than the usual giving yourself more stopping time and 
slower curves/corners is going downhill.  The bus being towed will tend to 
push the rear end of the tow bus from side to side trying to jack knife both 
buses!  Especially when trying to brake on the downhills.  Nasty!  Since you 
are going to tow on fairly flat ground you should do alright, but keep 
reminding yourself over and over what you are doing!
