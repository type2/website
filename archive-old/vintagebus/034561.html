Mike is pretty much the scissor jack king of all time!!  An although it works 
well for him, I myself have never had much luck with the damn things.  Also 
with the great advancements in jack science in these modern times, you can 
now buy very small floor jacks for a very modest price.  We're talking under 
40 bucks!  The great thing about these baby floor jacks is they don't take up 
much room, so you can pretty much leave them in your bus full time.  Mine 
lives under my Z-bed and has saved my butt more than once.  From flats, to 
doing clutchs in campgrounds, I swear by these little critters.  An added 
bonus is that not only can you help yourself, but you can pretty help any car 
that needs lifting, from that babe in the Pinto to that stud in the Stang, 
you can throw on your shiny amour and come to the rescue!!
  Peace, Love, and we all share the same road--some just park on the side of 
it more than others,
        Mr. Bubble Head
