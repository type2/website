Hello to everyone, but especially to the Vintagebus Listees who are NEATO
members,


It's that time of year for all good NEATO members and early Type 2 
lovers to grab an envelope and a 33 cent stamp and do the democratic 
thing!  I believe I'm correct in saying that NEATO is the only national VW 
Club that is truely run &quot;democratically&quot;, that is, our members actually
elect 
our Officers and Board members periodically.  I wish other VW Clubs 
would do this also.  

Anyway, if you're a current NEATO member, please grab your newest issue 
(green cover - Nov/Dec 1999 issue) of NEATO's &quot;Old Bus Review&quot; and 
find the enclosed &quot;ballot&quot; stuffed inside.   please read the bio's from 
the various candidates and select those that you want in leadership 
positions for NEATO.  Mark your ballots and send them IMMEDIATELY to 
the address on the ballot.  Pease do it right now, don't put it in your 
&quot;I'll get to that next week&quot; pile.  You might not get to it until it's 
too late.  They must be received by Jan 31st, 2000 at the OBR address.

To those of you who aren't NEATO members, thanks for your patience 
with this &quot;reminder&quot; post.  For those of you who are, thanks for 
participating in the democratic process!  Please send those votes in 
right away!  If you'd like to join and/or want more info about NEATO,
please 
e-mail me or Dave Easterwood privately.

Bill Bowman
NEATO
