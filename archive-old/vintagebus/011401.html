I always wondered about this; he gets people from all over the country
to send in money to join, in hopes of getting one of the rarest-of-the-rare
newsletters.

Does SOTO have a charter?  There are no other officers?  People have
bitched about SOTO for *years* yet nobody (myself included) has done
squat about it?

Why not?  What's keeping us from lynching Heard right here and now?
Fear?  Any of our x-soto people on the list know anything?
