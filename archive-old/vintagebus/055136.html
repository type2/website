Subject: Ocktobugfest at Puyallup Wa and parts finds.

Hi Volks,
Since it it just two days before one of the best swap meets up here we 
thought we would offer to look for other volks on this list for hard to find 
VW parts they need.  If the part is expensive or big we can only get a phone 
number or Email address of the seller for you.  So send us very short list of 
parts you are looking for and we will see what we can find!  Yes, AL we are 
keeping you in mind about the tin piece.  ;-)   Eric&amp;Barb
