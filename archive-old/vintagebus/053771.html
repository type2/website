Kris--This is the original post--perhaps this will answer your questions
about a &quot;middleman&quot;?? &amp; &quot;trying to get my name out there&quot;. As &quot;middleman&quot; I
receive nothing, maybe hopefully a &quot;Thanks&quot;?  But you know what--??
It's really Not worth the effort to help some people--sorry i was a bother
to you, &quot;your estranged uncle&quot;

Its fine to talk about the availabilty of a canvas, maybe it can help
someone out, but why does there have to be a middle man?  Why cant someone
just order one directly and not use their estranged uncle to get it?  Why
always try to be in the middle of everything and get your name out there?
Provide contact info and ride off into the sunset, no need to carry it
further than that.

Good News -- I have found a source for making the DC canvas for the hoops on
your Truck. The material is one of the best out there &quot;Sunbrella&quot;. the cost
is around $550 and I'm having one made for my 1960DC. Good news so far and
will let you know the outcome--

Bad news -- The person that is making them has been burned on several
occasions by non-paying VW people--But will make them for me and Only
through me--i can deal with that--After i get mine done i will take some
pics and let you know--Then if there is an interest in the DC canvas i will
have it made for you--That is the best i can do at this time--
Shipping will be from Phoenix , AridZona--stay tuned--if interested PLMK by
E-mail-- TWWM, uj
