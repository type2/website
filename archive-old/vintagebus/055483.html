 I need to replace these on my '61 panelvan.  I have a located a seller that
 has complete NOS setups that include the spindles, king pins, link pins,
 needle bearings, grease nipples etc.  His ad says they are VW part #'s 211
 405 301C and 211 405 302C and that they are for chassis # 999305 to 1 144
 281.  I thought these were all basically the same with some modifications
 for 1964 and up.  Why wouldn't these fit a 1961, chassis # 646230???????
 Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks, Don.

Hi, I am still not on the list, but I thought I would reply to this, it was 
in the email box.

The 55-63 buses take a smaller diameter link pin than the 64-67.  The 
trailling arms 55-63 have a gap to hold the links with.  next time you adjust 
your link pins (you do adjust your link pins, don't you, it is real easy, 
takes not long) look at how they fit into the trailling arms.  ok.  the links 
have to fit both the trailling arms, and the kingpin.

the trailling arms fit into the beam.  evidently you cannot put a 64-67 
trailing arm in a 55-63 beam, not sure why, but I have that impression, never 
tried, but you can put a 64-67 beam on a 55-63 bus.   

anyway, 63 3/4 ton spindles and 63 1 ton spindles fit on the same trailing 
arms - the 55-63 kind with the same holes for the link pins.  That is because 
they are identical to the 64-67 1 ton spindles - later backing plate, brakes 
bolt on, later wheel bearings, but use the smaller link pins.  

the range of vins sound like the 63 stuff, if someone was looking in the book 
the right hand column it should have the M 215 (M216?) never can keep them 
straigh the one for 1 ton 1500 package in 1963.   

so if what you have takes the small links and larger brakes, it is the 1 ton 
package, and you can swap it onto your 61 by removing your 3/4 ton spindles.  
Keep the old spindles, and link pins- keep the pin in the cage in the 
bushing- they are a unit.    you can tap the bushing out of the kingpin  if 
you like.   new links can be annoyingly pricey, especially if you need just 
one and they come in sets of 4.    It'll take a full afternoon or a day to 
swap it over, depending on whether you have done this before, how crusty 
everything is, etc.  easier than changing the beam.  

Barndoors take the same links as 55-63 buses, and so someone could put the 
3/4 1 ton spindles on the bd by changing from spindle out, then use the 1 ton 
cheap easy to find better brakes.      might have to use the 55-63 trailing 
arm though.  I hear they do fit.  hm.
