&gt; i have teh same problem on my engine-well similar. i have not figured out

&gt; the nut.

&gt; ronnie had suggested a tool to me that can be found a local hardware store-i
&gt; forget what it is called. i think he said it is used for threading inside a
&gt; pipe.

Not for threading, just for turning.  It's called an &quot;internal pipe
wrench&quot;

This is my tool of last resort for removing the oil filler gland nut.  The
nut is kind of thin and I don't want to distort it, so I start with the
tool that bears on the slots.  If that doesn't work, the pipe wrench works
fine!
