Quote from the  friendly and knowledgable list members:

My main man, John Kyte said:
I keep thinking I have the highly desirable benchseat/cab divider.
I tell myself it helps keep the drafts out some, but some door seals
would
help alot more.  As a matter of fact in the days I had a 67 crawl-over I
made my own cab divider out of plywood they were so desirable.  You also
don't have to look at all the junk floating around in the back with the
highly sought after cab divider.


they were afflicted by the wingvent thing too and made the connection all
by
my-self. I think it is another conspiracy that Art Bell needs to hear
about...

some thing to think about fo those of us who haul a lot of gear in our
splits,
if you don' t put up a  full divider  at least   put up some 3/8&quot; plywood
behind the driver so that if the vehicle ever comes to a unexpected stop
that 1/2 drive power drill or snare drum or other IFO doesn't plant its's
self in the driver's Occipital bone. This also is a dandy place to put
that  oft  wished for fire extinguisher. May haps this would work on the
coveted walk-through as well as our more utilitarian stepsister Kombis.

that takes care of the identified flying objects now about that UFO
Moulder...
