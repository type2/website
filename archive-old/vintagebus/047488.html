Subject: barndoor sighting on Speedvision!
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Anyone catch the show on Speedvision last night about the 5 most important 
cars of the century? It had some great footage of the VW plant showing a 
bunch of ovals, convertibles and even some barndoors! Among the other cars 
were the model T, Citroen DS and the Austin Mini. I just caught the end of 
the VW section so if anyone out there taped it I would love to get a copy of 
it. Peace.
