&lt;&lt; Ronnie set me up with kits w/seals and a DIFFERENT seal that he said was 
the
 proper one,he said save the seal from the kit for a bug.I have had no
 problems with them on the 59(2500 miles) with a small nut gearbox.The seal I
 used looked wider than the seals in the kit.      Ted Smith &gt;&gt;
Hi Ted,
Would any of those seals you mention above be the paper gaskets?  Seals are 
very three dimensional items, while gaskets are much more two dimensional and 
often made of paper.    Eric&amp;Barb
