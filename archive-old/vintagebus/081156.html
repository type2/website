Subject: EveryBus Quicktime Panos

Hi Volks,

I dusted off my QTVR software and uploaded two quicktime VR panorama 
movies I shot at EveryBus 2004. You will need a version of quicktime 
that supports VR in order to view these movies. If you need to update 
or install quicktime, visit http://www.quicktime_dot_com. The software is 
free to download for mac or windows.

Ever wonder what the view from the top of the EB shelter looks like?

Perhaps you've been there, but didn't have time to visit the Canadian 
Pavilion:

I'll probably break the links later in the week when I upload my full 
trip report, but for the meanwhile I hope you enjoy these as much as I 
enjoyed shooting them.

BTW, can someone please forward this message to the Vanagon list? I'll 
be off that list for another week until I get caught up with life here 
at home.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
