&gt;Having seen this bus in person many times, I too was surprised at the
&gt;price. I was surprised at how *low* it is.&gt; -Jack

I haven't seen this bus, but from my past experience with Craig I would
believe his $10,500 asking price is fair.  He's a good guy, and if anything,
his modesty on the bus' condition is to prevent disappointment to anyone
interested.
