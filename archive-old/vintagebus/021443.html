Mike and list,
   I to have seen this commercial, and those are the kind of chicks in that
bus that I told you guys about, high maintenance. Now I don't know about those
dudes in there but who cares about them anyways! But there are some guys who
wont ride in buses, we got a name for them also.............
                                           Oh so informative,
                                                        Lyle
