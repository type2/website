 Again how are they powered?

I believe the clam shell ones are earlier.  used onpre SO-42/SO-44 buses.  
The So-42/So-44 kits used 65 on use the interior metal bulb holders like the 
light over your head in a bus.  THere are two of these screwed to the wall in 
the SO-42.  they run off a wire from the engine compartment (off regulator?)  
which has an inline fuse.  at the inside, there is a push on/off switch, a 
dogleg of metal like the curtain rod, with two holes in.  The covers are 
rectangular, a u channel in cross section.  The 65 westy I have came with the 
kind that screw to the dogleg with two screws.   I have seen some 
(later-maybe) that the cover slides into a channel.  As the covers were 
missing when I got my bus, I had to scrounge them from other buses and swap 
meets, and one of mine can swing either way.  It has the holes for the screw 
attachment , and also the groove for the channel.   Later universal 
replacement?  maybe.  

Anyway, racenut, I am not sure what your original question is.   Do you have 
a 67 bus and want interior lights?
