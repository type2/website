Subject: Pass side mirror door hinge stud stuck

Maybe the title is a bit vague... Basically I do not have a passenger side 
rear view mirror and want to install one.  Actually I have an old VWOA 
elephant ear to put in there.  But the trouble is that the &quot;rod&quot; or &quot;pin&quot; 
that goes through the hinge will not come out.

I have ground off the top mushroom part and tried to bang it (very hard) 
both up and down and will no luck at all, zero movement.  I seems to have 
rusted and bonded together, typical.

If I recall correctly someone mentioned that one of the solutions is to just 
plain old drill right through the pin?  I doubt an easy-out will work at 
all.

The more I drive the bus as a daily driver in Atlanta traffic the more I 
desire actually seeing what cars I am about to run over in the blind spot :)

Any ideas are greatly appreciated because I have exhausted all the easy 
ideas.

Thanks,
Adrian Pillow - half time bus driver
