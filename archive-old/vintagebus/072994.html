Subject: Re: [VB] 1961 Double Cab... 07-30-03

Hi Rex,
Good to see the progress coming on.
I feel a little slack about not working on my 67 Panel
but then I remeber that the average outside temp is
about 39 F &amp; I cahnge my mind and read a VW mag or
manual.
I'd love to see some more pics on your site.
Just out of interest, what is motivating the DC at the
moment?
:o)
Cheers &amp; God Bless

&gt; I got insurance on the 1961 Double Cab and got the
&gt; title changed over 
&gt; to my name. Also got it registered and got some
&gt; plates for it. I 
&gt; mounted the back plate on the decklid but decided
&gt; I'd go ahead and 
&gt; get some bumpers on the truck so I could do the
&gt; front plate too.
