Maybe running an engine is a prerequisite before calling it a success but I
did the old aviators trick using a piece of silk thread between the case
halves and used some gasksinch sealer.  The engine has been sitting on the
stand, full of oil, and the only place it's leaking from is my cheapy
aftermarket sump.  There is no leaking from he case halves at all.  Works
for me.
