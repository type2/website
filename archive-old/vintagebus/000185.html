I've been working on decoding the M-code/vin plate on our 65 Sundial/microbus

the plate reads
07 0
425 002 (062)? 025 114
UA 2212 381783 5038305

so, the parts I'm sure about
07 0 = October 7
UA = US, Los Angeles
2212 = Standard Microbus, Cargo doors right, LHD
381783 = velvet green/blue white/mesh gray
5038305 = 5 (1965) 038305 = 38,305th bus that year 

this makes the bus a fairly early 66 then correct? built 10/7/65 = 66 model 
year?

now for the M codes.  I checked 2 sources for them and am left fairly 
confused because the answers vary greatly.

on Everett's page (VW Planet) it reads this way:
425 = seatbelts &amp; mounting points
002 = ???
062 = passenger side mirror (I dont know if it's 002 or 062, my writing was a 
lil messy and from what the bus has, it could be either.
025 = 6 pop out windows &amp; US Spec Bumpers
114 = 6 opening side windows

All these seem correct and the bus has them all, but on the NEATO page, the 
codes read this way:
425 = ???
002 = ???
062 = passenger side mirror
025 = lap belt anchors
114 = 6 popout windows

these are all correct too, but vastly different from the other ones

So what gives?  Esentially I arrive at the same answers. The bus does have 6 
popouts, it does have US spec bumpers, seatbelts and a passenger side mirror 
post (mirror is MIA), but the answers for the codes are off quite a bit on 
some.
