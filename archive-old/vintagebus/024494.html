Subject: rear hatch seal

I previously made a query concerning the rear hatch seal for the splitty 
and how outragiously expensive they are. I recieved an interesting reply 
and thought I would share my info with the list. I was told that the rear 
hatch seal on later model busses will fit and that the wrecking yards 
have quite a few of them. Hope this info helps someone else out with this 
problem.

I also had an idea for fixing rocker panels, at least under the doors. It 
seems to me that, once fixed, this problem of rust is likley to reaccur 
because water collects in this area. My idea is to use &quot;sign foam&quot;. It is 
a material used in the sign industry. It can be carve with ease. By 
making a cuved block of this stuff and epoxying it in, there would be no 
place for moisture to collect, ever. I am still thinking about this one, 
because I would like my bus to be as original as possible, but the idea 
of curing this problem FOREVER may induce me to sacrifice my purist 
leanings.
