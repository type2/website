&gt;Anyone ever retro-fit a later tank with a gas gauge in one of these
&gt;early splits?

Why do you need to change out the tank?  Just look in the official VW
accessories catalog and get the official metal ruler that you could
stick down the filler neck.  :)

&gt;To me, it seems like it would be as easy as puttin in the new tank
&gt;with a sender, intsalling a gauge on the dash and running the wires
&gt;as normal??

I can't speak to mechanically, but electrically, it really is that
simple.  You need a wire from hot-in-run power to the gauge (normally
black), the long wire from the gauge to the sender (normally brown), and
a ground jumper from a sender flange screw and/or ground terminal to the
Bus body (also normally brown).  For a stock gauge, the body of the gauge
needs to be grounded.  If you want the gauge illumination to work, you
also need a wire from the speedometer illumination lights to the gas
gauge (normally gray with a red stripe).

If the dash is thrashed it's probably time to get out the (metric) hole
saw and make a hole for the gauge.  But if it's nice, you might consider
leaving it alone and mounting the gauge in a bracket on the parcel shelf
or similar.
