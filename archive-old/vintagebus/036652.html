I just picked up a pair of universal CV joint boots at the place where I am
having my wheel cylinders resleeved. They have steps(in increments of approx
1.5mm at each end so that one can cut off the rings that are too big. They
are made in Germany and are of a much better quality rubber than the VW
specific aftermarket axle boots that I am familiar with. The jointing
surface of the split has two interlocking ridges that get filled with
jointing compound before assembly. Haven't installed them yet but I have
fitted them up by eye and they look like they will work OK. The crappy ones
that are on the bus at the moment are less than five years old and they are
rock hard.

Later
