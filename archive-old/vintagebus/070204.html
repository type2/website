Subject: re:oil temp gauge

I have not installed one yet, but I believe I have read that the oil
pressure relief is not a good spot, as this is kind of a dead spot for the
oil, ie not a lot of oil moving over this spot...I think when I looked into
this before there was some disagreement as to whether an oil pressure gauge
may be more beneficial compared to a temp gauge. If you search the archives
you can probably find the reasoning others used.
