Subject: How much Paint?(taillight trace?_
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hey guys---
My 1959 Panel is almost ready for paint and I was wondering how much paint 
will I need for it for the outside and the cab? cargo area? The outside and 
cab will be Sealing Wax Red and the cargo area will be grey? I really don't 
want to run out and have to go for a new mix (extra paint is fine)! 

Also--- Ive got to cut the holes for the taillights as right now they are 
solid because of corner repairs --would anyone with a 58-61 bus w/ original 
taillights be willing to trace the holes on paper from the beltline down and 
acurately down the line of the hatch/ engine compartment area? I'd be more 
than willing to pay for shipping of the paper and cost of materials? Do you 
guys know to measurement of the holes also?

Thanks alot--Pete
