I need to replace the current hoses in my '60 crewcab (stock front and
'65 rear) as a couple are &quot;swollen&quot; and barely allow the brake fluid to
pass.  

Do the stainless hoses suffer from this problem with age?
For a street application (bus) would I be just as well off replacing
with new rubber hoses?

yes- the rubber hoses swell/crack/close up inside where you can't see it,
causing brake malfunction, not fun.   Replace all four.   

The metal ones do not have the same problem.  Instead, sometimes they rust or
crack.   But this is much less common that the rubber flex lines going bad.   

Do not replace the rubber lines with metal ones, as you need the flex as your
wheel do move a bit.   Neither replace the metal ones with rubber, as it will
end up being a PITA.    I recommend flushing the brake system every year-
which gets rid of the dirty old brake fluid which may have water in it,
extending the life of your brake parts.    Check the metal lines visually,
replace if neccessary.
