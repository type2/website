Subject: No title for bus
Message-Id: &lt;l03130303b38234d561d6_at_[169.204.96.237]&gt;

I have a bus with no title or registration.
How can I get it titled?
I live in Wa. state and the bus has Ca. plates.
It's been sitting for 15 years and nobody know who owned it last.
Can I take the title and ID plates from a junk bus or will I go to Jail?
It's a good bus but if it's a hassle to title I will use it for parts.
Thanks!
