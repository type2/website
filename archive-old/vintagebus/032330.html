&lt;&lt; Our question is this:  Is it permissible to use 2 shims at the base to get 
the required deck height?  We want to keep the cr low yet still have to go to 
pull the mountains (and stumps if need be). &gt;&gt;
Hi Dave,
Yes you can.  As long as you do not push the base of the cylinder so far out 
that the wider outer diameter of the cylinder ends up outside of the case 
cylinder bores.  If you need lower CR without pushing the cylinders out to 
far with shims then you can at the least radius the sharp edge/corners inside 
the head (Which helps prevent these sharp edges from being  hot spots causing 
detonation, and run on.), and a little reshaping of the head chamber is OK, 
but not alot.  If one still needs more space still to lower the CR then you 
can have the tops of the pistons machined off up to .050&quot;, the less the 
better though.  Only use shims between the head, and cylinder as a last 
desprate measure.    Eric&amp;Barb
