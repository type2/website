Greetings,

Reverse gear is engaged by a brass (?) cage gizmo
rather than a 'normal' selector fork.  Apparently these cages
do wear and make engagement of reverse problematic.  Could
be this sort of problem - have to crack the tranny to fix it.

&gt; I have a 67 splitty that has a gremlin in reverse. Sometimes it works and
&gt; sometimes it does'nt. What is strange about it is that when it works,
&gt; everything seems to work fine. Good engagement and no sign of slippage.
When
&gt; it does'nt, it seems that everything is working, ie., shifter and such
feels
&gt; normal, but theres no go. It acts as if it is not in gear. All forward
gears
&gt; work fine. Is it possible that the shift fork or the reverse gear is
&gt; slipping?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks, John
