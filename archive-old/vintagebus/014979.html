The old guy I bought my air compressor from, and that Steve Johnson
bought his (now Tom Mink's) Single Cab from had an Okrasa motor,
complete top to bottom, front to back, supposedly rebuilt, and wated
$7k.  The same guy had a '68 bug with 1500 original miles; while not
a highly desirable car, it was unusual to see one in that condition...
