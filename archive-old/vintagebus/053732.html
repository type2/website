&gt; &gt; FWIW, I've had a couple VW gearbox rebuilders offer that the cure for
&gt; &gt; notchy shifting is to remove the Sta-Lube GL4 and replace it with
&gt; &gt; Valvoline GL4.  Just rumors...
&gt; 
&gt; Now, if valvoline would make their GL4 available on store shelves to be
&gt; bought.....
&gt; 
&gt; StaLube is the ONLY gl4 i've found that didnt have to be mailordered. (at
&gt; least, in the augusta ga area.)
&gt; 
&gt; Any suggested vendor?
