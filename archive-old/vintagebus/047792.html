Thom-
I can get you more of the aluminum tubing I provided you with last 
time......I think I gave you some right?
It was a few bucks a feet and was a dead match.
Maybe you can find it loacally?
The stuff I got wasn't metric but it fit great.
I also got some aluminum rod which I used to reproduce the pins at the 
corners.
Heated it and smashed it into place.
Came out fantastic.
Do you need another set of the westy tags?

&lt;&lt;When I bought the rack, it was shipped in pieces.  The
aluminum rails were toast.  I couldn't find replacements,
but I did find steel tubes of the right diameter.  Within
a short while, they rusted, and they look like crap.  I'm
sure I'm having galvanic corrosion issues as well, of
which I'm not yet aware.&gt;&gt;
