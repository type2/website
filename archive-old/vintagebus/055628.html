&gt; My dad is 75 years old and wants to sell his BMW. It's an 81 R100/7. The bike

Waaaahh!!!!!!!  I *WANT* it!!!! Soooooo bad!!!!  Can't afford it, would be
too terrified to ride it, but I do love the old Beemers.  I owned an R80
G/S (350 lb., 800cc dirt bike!!!!) and i did love that baby dearly, 'til I
parked it in the back of a Toyota :-( No injury, but I have not been on a
bike since.

&gt; having a bike that actually runs! I've got about 10 British bikes in various
&gt; stages of disassembly.

So, Al!  Your secret is out!!!  It's not the reliability, it's not the
German engineering, what you love in a vehicle is the oil spots on the
driveway!!! :-)

Seriously, volks, Al has a garage to drool all over!  not just the buses,
but the bikes, the Porsches, that old truck down under the garage, the
tools.  I thought I had died and gone to heaven :-)
