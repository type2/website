Subject: Wiper Switch needed/and suggestions?

Anyone have a 2 Speed Wiper Switch they'd be willing to sale?  Seems both of
the ones I have a are bad.  Before I'm pointed to WW I know they have one for
$60 but no stock.  I've emailed Bus Depot to see if they have them in stock.
I've emailed Ronnie to see if he carries then, although last email didn't seen
to reach.

Here's what I've done to check it.  I've jumped across to the low and &quot;high
speed terminal from the power in and the wiper work.  I can use a Dome light
switch across the terminals and they work.  The switch seems to be grounded
OK.

Anyone know the function of the other two wires running to the wiper motor.
Is 31b ( I believed that's the lettering on the switch), the brown wire on the
switch a ground of sorts.

Hard to believe both my switches are bad.

Dave
