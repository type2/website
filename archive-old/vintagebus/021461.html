My favorite thing is seeing the original pink, a pair of cali. black plates, 
the entire area next to the engine compartment AND the pair of VIN tags!
I've seen that combo for sale more than once!!!!

&lt;&lt; excellent!!!!!  that switched plate thing is just too funky,

(they didn't offer papers with it though, did they?)

 I entered the numbers into the registry, and annotated the plates as being
 sold on ebay.
