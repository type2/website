Subject: Re: [VB] assult by battery

Doesn't sound like it was a positive experience.  Maybe you should cable a
complaint to the shipping company, and charge them for the damage.  It looks
bad, but just remember it isn't terminal.  Keep us posted!

I had something similar recenly - the battery came loose and smashed up the taillight
pretty good.
