&gt; Ill take all the 52-67 taillights you have at 4.95$ each!!!!!!!!!!!!!
well,

Busdepot has the lenses for $4.95 each to fit 62-67.. call em up and tell
em to send all they can get... I'm sure given cash in advance they can get
you at least a thousand...

Since that was within the range you specified, im sure this will help...
If you meant pre 62 lenses, those are NLA new... But you DID say 52-67,
without specifying a year preference, so all the 62-67 lenses you can
handle should do just fine ;)

take care,

Steve

p.s. just funnin with ya...
