&gt;    LOL.... :)   No, same tire and rim sizes. To me, it looks like it is
the
&gt; entire side, from front to back--I notice it both from the front and rear.
&gt; The shocks are actually fairly new.

Hey, Einstein :)
Park on a level  spot.Take some measurements.
Choose a common body point on both sides,
front and rear ( fender lip, door edge OK, but not bumpers )
Then park in the opposite direction on the same spot.
Remeasure the same locations.
Compare the measurements.
Alignment specs require the weight of the driver
for accurate adjustment,so include that in your search.
It is quite uncommon for a bus to lean as you describe
so please post the results. How is the tire wear?
Any unusual handling characteristics? Braking?
