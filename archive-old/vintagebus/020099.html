  Everette I'll give ya $10 for the site! ;^)
  
  I agree Everett's site is great, I've gotten a lot of 
reponse off the ad for my '62 (still for sale at 
http://busforsale.home.att_dot_net plug, plug).  I do see 
some silly prices for stuff tho - like the &quot;recently 
reduced to $3,800&quot; for a '60 dbl door panel that makes 
my $3,500 standard look pristine.
 I except the that I am an enthusiast, not a salesman 
and will always lose money on buses, (the fact I have 
sunk over $4000 in mine will attest to that) but geez 
looking at other pricing makes me wonder what I'm doin' 
wrong!
  ......Maybe I should fake a Schwinn logo on it and ask 
$5,000??
