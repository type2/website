Subject: Re: [VB] BBB IV Friday Phx Caravan? &amp; tent question
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Anyone in the Phoenix area leaving Friday for BBB?  Early to mid morningish maybe?  Does anyone know how long it takes to get there for that matter?  I'm guessing about 4 hours, maybe a lil less with the 2016, but we dont mind slow.  

If anyone is planning on leaving Friday we'd love to tag along.

Also, we recently picked up a nice early Sundial tent and it came with the long metal piece that's supposed to attach to the roof via about 20 screws and the back of the roof panel slides into the groove in this piece of metal. Any suggestions as to what type of screws we should use and should any sort of sealer be used too?  Silicone or something?  We want to attach that part to the bus after we get there.....VW Howard's gonna help us......right? and I need to pick up all the necessary supplies beforehand 

Thanks
