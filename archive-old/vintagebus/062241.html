Subject: RE: [VB] Correct Rim primer?

&gt;&gt;Normal Looking to blast, prime and paint rims soon. Is the backside, and 
thearea the tire sits left in grey?  or black? primer for 66? &lt;&lt;

Hi Volks,
As far as we have observed VW or there supplier of rims primered, and painted 
them semi-gloss black.  Then the outer surface of the rim which is most 
visable they color painted the rim.  This resulted in some overspray onto the 
semi-gloss black especially on the innered side of the rim through the rim 
slots.
