&gt;  Stereo 8 track Supertuner  yesterday  then head out of town down 101, past 
&gt;  where the road slid into the inlet when that earthquake happened a few
&gt;  months 
&gt;  ago, but they did patch it up so there is one lane going out 101, even if 
it
&gt;  
&gt;  is a wierdly banked curve, and the hills have trees, and the sun is 
shining 
&gt;  and the wind is blowing in the open passenger side safari (held open a tad
&gt;  by 
&gt;  a 1x2), and the engine purrs, and the Todd Hill rebuild tranny now has 
just 
&gt;  about 3K on it, and shifts fine so far so good, and the left front brake 
&gt;  stats acting funny (shudder shudder- hm) but I am on my way to Shelton to 
&gt;  help a guy whos bus does not go.   the Olympic Mountains 
&gt;    loom hugely over the road at a few points- alpine majesty with snow on
&gt;  top. 
&gt;    It is so nice to see mountains.  Mt Rainier when you are headed E or N- 
if
&gt;  
&gt;  it is clear, and the Olympics in the W/S direction.   everything is lush
