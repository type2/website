&quot;Crows mightily?&quot;

Personally I feel the grateful dead belong to my predecessor 
generation, and I've never really gotten &quot;into&quot; them.  There's a
couple songs of theirs that I like, but I've never been a groupie
sort of guy. For any band. There's a lot of &quot;new&quot; dead-heads, but 
honestly I think they're in it for the kewel threads and the drugs, 
victims of &quot;retro-marketing&quot; who chase blindly after every new craze
they see on MTV.  Like some locals I've seen, that one day outta
nowhere they've got dredlocks.  And I think white guys with
dreds look pretty funny, IMHO.  And those clothes; that style that's
calculated to make you look like you're barely hanging on until
the next paycheck - those threads ain't cheap!  Poor guys are paying
$60 for repros of bell bottoms that my parents threw out once
their buzz wore off.

I let people do whatever they're gonna do - who am I to stop them?
But I can still giggle when I see 'em at the VW shows.

I also see no direct connection between my busing and the dead,
phish, or whatever the grunge band du jour is.  I like buses because
I like buses.  I like porsches because I like porsches, not because
mc hammer/pete rose/whoever-van-halen drove one.  My car hobbies
have survived through several different fashion trends and they'll
survive even more.  

Besides, their late buddy Jerry drove a big fat BMW, a 7-series
I believe.

Ever notice how Harleys have become a boutique item now?  I think
buses have come close to suffering the same fate.
