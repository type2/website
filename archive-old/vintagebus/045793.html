 There is a type 3 cooler that has more fins to it than the later doghouse 
 cooler.  They both have the same amount of tubes through them so there is no 
 differance in internal surface area for the oil to slide up against and 
loose 
 it's heat.  We have wondered why VW gave up on this type 3 cooler when they 
 came out with the doghouse system for the upright engine in 1971.  They 
 should have had had the tooling availible since the type 3 cooler came out 
 much earlier than 1971.  Our guess is that the tighter finning caused the 
 cooling air to have more problems going through it.  When cooling air 
removes 
 heat it must expand.  Too much heat to remove and/or too tight an area to 
 pass through and the amount of air you can push through it gets to be less 
 and less.  Making the cooler less and less effective.

better get some tests and see what is really cooler.
