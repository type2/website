I don't know if Wal-Mart still has the deal going on... but I know some people on the list got in on it a while back too.
I picked up a 2.5 ton high lift floor jack, and 2 2 ton jack stands that go the same height...for a measly $30.  It is some of the same products they sell separetly...but it was all in one big box as
the &quot;SUV package&quot;.  Cheap...very sturdy and well built though.  I haven't had any problems with them...and I've used that jack and the stands quite a bit.
The Wal-Mart in town didn't have it...but I was way up in northern WI and the wal-mart up there had it...
shop around...

later
Isaiah
