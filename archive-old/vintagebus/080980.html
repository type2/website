Subject: Re: [VB] shift knobs

Hi Ian,
We hate to rain on your parade, but using glass as a shift knob is a bad 
idea, unless you can make it wiegh the same as the stock plastic shift knob.  We 
have seen VWs with solid glass door knobs used in this way and the tranny 
shifting forks in the tranny get worn out much sooner due to the extra wieght.  
Even in the owners manuals, year after year they state it is not a good idea to 
use the shifter as a hand rest for the same reason!
