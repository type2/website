&gt; For me theres nothing better than pulling up to the local
&gt; surf break, pulling
&gt; my longboard out of my Bus and hitting the beach.
&gt; The chicks be diggin me
&lt;snip&gt;

My chick was diggin me too the first time we met...
Jimmy Buffett on the boom box, driving my '63, nice tan, etc...
When I had my 63 bus - long since totaled by the way - (*snif*), moment of
silence...I worked in Ocean City, MD where I met my wife.  She loved riding
around in it, pulling up close to the beach to watch the sunrise (yes,
sunrise!)and fly kites with me.  Unfortunately, a few months after we got
married, she was in the back sleeping when we were broadsided by a tractor
trailer that had run a red light late at night.  That was the last time she
stepped into a VW - bus, bug or anything else with those initials.  I not
only consider myself lucky to still have my wife, I now have convinced her
to at least let me have a VW again.
