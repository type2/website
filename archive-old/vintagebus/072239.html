Subject: Re: [VB] A Priday question

euro market VWs had semaphores till ~1960.   Export to N America had blinky 
turn signals earlier.   There are many wierd combos not common here, as 
standard (ie cheaper) models were available elsewhere, in which things like 
semaphores and cable brakes and 6V and smaller motors were factory installed later than 
we are used to.

&lt;&lt; My son and I went across town on Wed. to have a look at a &quot;'57&quot; Oval
 that was for sale.  It is in semi-restored condition, bad front clip and
 non-curve matching front hood.  Strangely, [at lest to me] this &quot;'57&quot;
 had semaphores.  What gives?  I thought they went the way of the
 dinosaurs back in '55. &gt;&gt;
