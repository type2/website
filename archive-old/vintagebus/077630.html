Subject: Tranny swap and eye damage...

I worked on my '61 Double Cab this weekend. I have compressor air and 
electricity and some good light in my shop now. Found a little time to work 
so decided to pull the truck in and do something about the tranny.

I've been driving around with no 4th gear since I got the truck. I've got a 
good working used tranny, so decided to swap it out with the one that's in 
the truck. I've also had a really bad leak on the passenger side reduction 
gear box, so want to deal with that as well.

I got the engine pulled without too much trouble. Got working on pulling 
the transaxle. Had everything loose and ready to go except the 2 big tranny 
bolts under the bell housing. I zipped the first one off with the air gun 
and then went to do the other. That's when it happened.

When I zipped the bolt off, it came out faster than I expected. Something 
caused the big washer to skim off the end of the bolt and it zipped right 
into my left eyeball!

It happened so fast but I &quot;saw&quot; everything. It zipped right into my eye and 
looked like a 3-D movie or something. Was so fast my lid didn't get closed 
in time. It apparently hit my eyeball almost right in the pupil!

I put off going to the doctor until today. My family ganged up on me and so 
I went. They verified that I've got a corneal abrasion right on the iris 
below and right next to my pupil. If my eyeball was a bulls-eye...it would 
have been almost a direct hit.

Looks like some antibiotics and some care and I'll be good as new. But 
man...what a freak accident it was. When it happened it hurt like hell. My 
eye watered so much I thought I'd &quot;popped&quot; it. I was glad to see it was 
still in tact when I finally got a look.

I guess I should be wearing eye protection at all times....but I don't. I 
might consider it a little bit more now though.

Now....I got to get back to work on the truck. I don't have a bearing 
puller to get the outer reduction gear bearing off. That's the only way to 
be able to get the axles off the tranny...right???

I've got the small nut tranny, so may go ahead and split the boxes and 
check 'em all out to make sure there isn't a bearing falling apart or 
something. I guess if I do that maybe that reduction gearbox half might 
force that bearing off????
