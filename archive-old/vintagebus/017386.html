Sounds like you have a broken mount.  Climb under and check where the 
trans bolts to the body in the front, and where the trans bolts to the

&gt; Also, I learned today that the sloppy knocking is aparent in 3rd as well
&gt; when I let off the gas in low rpm's.  I also wanted to say tranny mounts,
