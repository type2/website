Its friday and apologize for pushing the point on the VW content...

I am looking for the fella who I believe was swapping across from Ken
Economy's Early camper and teardrop trailer or maybe on the next row across
&gt;from Lynn and Larry Reno's booth. This fella had some camera equipment for
sale that I shoulda bought but didnt. Can anyone help?
Clues/Police description:
Caucasian male, mid to late 40's or very early 50's 5'11&quot;-6', Multiple day
beard growth but not full beard~possibly clean shaven. Shorter conservative
&lt;normal&gt; hair style. Accompanied by caucasian female presumed to be spouse.
Some VW parts FS but had older manual 35mm Nikon SLR and lenses in aluminum
camera suitcase.

Otherwise anyone dumping older 35mm EQ for Digital please contact me via pmail.

Thanks,
&quot;No-scoops&quot; Ellis\
