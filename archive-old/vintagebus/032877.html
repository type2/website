HI Jason,
Well if he want we could sell him our 1963 truck's good used front wheel
cylinders for $80.00 for all four.  Have just removed the original front beam
to be replaced with 1966-67 front beam and brakes.

&lt;&lt;  He is wondering if he can remove the whole spindle set up at the link
pins, will a spindle set up with link pins from his 67 parts bus fit the
earlier front end arms?  &gt;&gt;
No can do.  The earlier link pins are smaller diameter than the 1964-67 ones.
