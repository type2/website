&lt;&lt; I also do brazing with a 0 tip on heat sensitive and delicate areas (read 
thin metal), but the flux problem in new to me, and seems to make sense due 
to the acid.  I sandblast and clean with solvent after brazing. E&amp;B think 
this will help with the flux problem?  &gt;&gt;
Hi Tom,
Hope so!  We just like the idea of staight steel also instead of brass, or 
lead.  Steven H. has been doing body work since the 1960s, was trained by his 
father in the art, has more experience in this than us.  He does not use the 
brazing due to this problem also.  Eric&amp;Barb
