Subject: Re: July 4th - Prescott, AZ - ABC retreat

Attn:	Arizona Bus Club members and friends

Be my guests for the July 4th weekend, in Prescott.  Guests are welcome from
Thursday evening till Wednesday morning.

Plenty to do, and way cooler than Phoenix.  Rodeo, parade, arts &amp; crafts
show, downtown street dance and festivities, Whiskey Row bar hopping....

I have limited room for camping, plenty of parking, and plenty of floor and
deck space for crashing.  Best view in town for the fireworks show, from my
deck.  First RSVP's get camping spots.  BYOB and BBQ stuff.

PLEASE RSVP (off the list) to Mark Chambers - cncvw_at_primenet_dot_com -  more
info on request...
