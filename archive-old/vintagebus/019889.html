well thanks for all your advice...I decided to go with butch at bears vw. 
although ronnie's engine sounded good, i wanted to get a cw crank, and go
single port. it seemed kind of foolish to get a new engine, just to need to
take the heads off and to deal with trying to replace the studs...

this way i can get the engine balanced crank/flywheel...etc. I will also be
getting the DH cooler setup, single port(now I will have a spare set of heads
that will fit my engine, a mild cam, and the crankshaft and flywheel will be 8
pinned.

the cam, lifters, flywheel and rods will be rebuilt, everything else wil be
new.

anything I did jumping out at you all as wrong...

i am looking forward to this, i wish i had time to put it together
myself...maybe next time.

i will be able to reuse the intake manifold. now I need to decide on a carb. 

butch recommends a 30 pict carbfor the engine he is building, i spoke with
rmmw and they said i could use the 6volt idle valve and choke element off my
28 pict and put them on the new carb.

as the 30 pict 1 electric choke is nla(according to ronnie) i guess i need to
go with the 30/31 the ronnie is selling? 

anyone out there have a 30 pict 1 with electric choke?

any suggestions on cleaning out the intake manifold?

thanks again for your help.
