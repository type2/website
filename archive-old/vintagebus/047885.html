&lt;&lt; I picked up an old 6volt starter today for a spare and was wondering how 
hard they are to rebuild. I mean can I do this or should I take it out to 
have it done? &gt;&gt;
Hi Shawn,
For the average VW owner it really is not possible to rebuild a starter or 
generator without spending alot on specialized tools.  What you can do to a 
starter is test it in a tranny bell housing with it's correct sized bushing.  
If it works or not you should next remove the forward cover to clean out the 
brush/commutator shavings and check/replace brushes.  If the brushes were too 
short or there was internal corrosion that might have been the reason for it 
not functioning.  Also clean/polish all external electrical connections and 
apply dielectric grease to keep the surfaces from oxidation.
