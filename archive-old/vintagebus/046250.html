think the 67 version of the middle seat side panel is differnt- why does this 
pop into mind- the legs of the seat being arranged differently and all.   
FWIW -NM.

&lt;&lt; Yep, HARD TO FIND.
 I have seen the 59-67 style ones fetch 75-150$ at shows and ALWAYS sell 
 before 9A.M.
 I wouldnt be surprised seeing values of this piece go through the roof.
 My 57 was 100% complete bus less this piece, I will admit paying DOUBLE
