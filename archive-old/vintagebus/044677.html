&lt;&lt; Looking for the rear seats for a 67 bus.  this was a camper bus so I need
the
 seats that fold into a bed.  If you have any or know where I can find
 some...please reply.
 thanks &gt;&gt;
Hi,
Was this camper a Westie or other type of bus camper conversion?  If Westie
and if it has a pop-top then it should have the westie model number on the M-
code plate.  If you are going to try to find the original model camper
interior then the bed can be quite different not only between camper interior
manufactures, but between westie models there are big differances.   Eric &amp;
