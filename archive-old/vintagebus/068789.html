&gt; I have a print out of a splitty as a space shuttle stuck to my wall, it's in 
&gt; orbit around earth, and has round mirrors both drivers and passengers sides, 
&gt; and fried egg turn signals. It has the stars and stripes and United States on 
&gt; the side.  Dunno the URL it came off,  but it's cool.   I'd like to know 
&gt; where to find the Russian space bus as well.
