Subject: re;lowered buses my 5 cents worth (another rant)

haven't written to the list latey but this has got my gote again
we all love buses or we wouldn't be on the list
so what the hey
i have 5 buses stock 61 single cab, stock 62 panel, 64 combi being
converted to limo
64 lowered combi, and my 65 westy.
i enjoy all my buses in all there configurations
does this mean you purist wouldn't talk to me if i'm driveing the
lowrider but would
if i was driving my camper, single cab or panel
i don't care what somebodys bus looks like , i will talk to or help
anyone with a
bus regardless what it and they look like, they must be O K if there in
a bus.
how many of you purist own a hot wheels bus (lowered wing flames etc).
so let the brotherhood of type2 (splitty) owners stay together, help
each other
and be happy, look at all the different styles of buses at JEROME and
BUSES
by the BRIDGE and we all got along, lets be happy that all these buses
are on the road
being driven and enjoyed and not trailered to every event.

see you all at JEROME and BUSES by the BRIDGE III  1999 January
