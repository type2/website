Subject: Bus Depot Now Hiring!

The Bus Depot has full and part time openings, for customer service reps,
phone operators, and shipping/receiving clerks.  Full-time would be weekdays
11 to 7.

For most of these positions, experience or VW knowledge is not required, as
we can train.  However, an interest in VW's is a plus; we'd rather have VW
enthusiasts here than not, which is why I'm posting here first.   Good
references are a must.   Pay is based on qualifications but is basically
entry-level (with opportunity for advancement).  As a extra perk,  you do
get all the VW parts you need at wholesale. :-)

We are located in Perkiomenville PA (an hour or less from Philadelphia,
Allentown, or Reading; 20 minutes from Quakertown, Pottstown, or Landsale).
