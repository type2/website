Subject: reasonable bumper price?

I looked for a year and a half with $500 in my pocket and did not find one.
Finally at the Vintage meet I stumbled onto one with good trim for $125.
$350-$550 is probably the normal range with the trim. You should run an ad
in the NEATO newsletter.
hope this helps,
