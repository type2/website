what a grueling weekend, left friday night for phoenix bugarama, hung out
there
sat., found some good stuff at fair prices (glad everyone was at kelly park)
did the home depot thing on the way home, uneventful trip, vwhowards new
(to him) camper ran flawless the 62 swap panel did it's thing once again
fully
loaded, both roof racks maxed etc., got home slept waiting for sunday
morning,
day of the bus rescue trip, these were buses that vwhoward and i located a
while back
had just talked about going back out there to get some more stuff, but when
the phone
call was made the X employee (our contact) said all buses were crushed, oh
no we
thought waited to long, but the weather and timing would have been just
right, lets
research it more, so the owner was tracked down and we were informed that
only a
few had been crushed and the others were next, around the 15th of this
month,
so another major road trip was made, good thing i had a few hours sleep,
called
vwhoward he couldn't go, so off i went, a few hours later i arrived to find
6 split
windows still left with a gasp of life left in them, made a deal, and saved
the last of this tribe 1. 61/62 double door panel (small tall lights, egg
beater turn signals) 2. 60's
sundial    3. 60's westy pop top  4+5.  a couple of kombis  6. late 50's
single cab
so now that i feel better, i can sleep again, some of the sheet metal off of
these buses
will be available for sale, if there is anything you need (metal wise)
please inform me
before friday, these buses will be picked up this weekend, only a couple are
to far
gone to save, will try to save the others.
