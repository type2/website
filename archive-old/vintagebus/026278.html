Subject: [VB] Hubcap and steering wheel colors on a 66 Crewcab
Message-ID: &lt;3835441A.70087F0C_at_stmarys-schools.pvt.k12.md_dot_us&gt;

Does anyone know what color hubcaps would be on a 66 Crewcab?  Chrome,
primer, or other?  I am thinking it would not be chrome, just because
nothing else on the bus was chrome.  Did they even come with hubcaps?
As for the steering wheel, I have all white accesory knobs, but it is
black.  I'm guessing the steering wheel should have been white as well,
as I think all commercial vehicles like mine came with all the bakelite
stuff in white.  No clue on the hubcaps, however.

Thanks for the input!

Paul
66 Crew
