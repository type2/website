&lt;&lt; Hi everyone. I have a '63 deluxe. Do I need to add a voltage drop to the 
clock in order for it to work? Thank you! &gt;&gt;
Hi Derrick,
If you have a 1963 bus then you most likely have a 6 volt wiper motor.  What 
you might want to do is to put a resistor before the wiper switch, and at the 
same time wire the clock to this resistor.  This way you should be able to 
two jobs with resistor.  We have run the 6 volt clocks on 12 volts.  Since 
they wind themselfs with a electric-magnetic pull wind they tend to do all 
right on 12 volts due to being able to cool during the 2-3 minutes that the 
clock runs off of the mechanical spring inside as long as they are clean and 
lubricated properly.  Though having the 6 volt clock run voltage much higher 
probably will affect the long term life of the clock, so if you are going to 
have to resistor the wipers you might as well do the clock at the same time.
