yup, bought a pumpkin orange 73 pop top westy when I was in high school.    
within two weeks the engine stopped working (needed rebuild)  and ended up 
getting a 77 2L FI motor from a smashed junkyard bus, and with a lot of help 
from my friends and Dad, installed it in the 73.  Later saw a two tone 
red/white splitty with a big red \X/ emblem on the nose and those real neat 
bumpers with the tubes on them, and I knew the direction I needed to go.  I 
had always thought there was something amiss with the windows in the 73.  But 
it was a real good bus.   Put a lot of miles and dead head stickers on it, 
and did a lot of camping in it.  The window washer and rear defogger even 
worked in it.  But only used the child's cot once, just to see how it was set 
up, never when I was actually camping.
I think the child cot rods were tubular, not square.  and they were painted 
black.

 I got an aqua 59 bus with interior of diamond patterned naugahyde, SWR dash 
and engine compartment, and those real neat bumpers with the tubes on them. 
It regularly got 31mph with a 1500sp, 28pict carb, split case tranny, rocker 
rot and rust around the rain gutters.  It handled really good, great for 
twisty mountain roads (which was a daily drive for me when not riding my 
bike), and I could go up my road in 2nd gear, every one else used first.    
sold the 73 to someone who painted it metallic green, put velour inside (I 
swear I didn't know they planned to) and then promptly rolled it.  That was 
so lame.
