Craig,

Go to your local bee keeper supply store (I have no idea if there is such a thing ;-) ) Get yourself a bellows operated bee smoker.  Stuff a little news paper in it and light it up.  You might have to make the nozzle smaller to get a small stream of smoke, but I don't see why it wouldn’t work.  

We had bees as a kid...I didn’t like um much though.

Those of you in engineering / building trades should recognize this...
I am looking for something that will generate a stream of smoke (or smoke
like particles) for testing air flow. Preferably one with a wand or hose to
put the smoke right at the area of interest. I have an air leak SOMEWHERE
on the 70's 1600, and am not getting anywhere w/ the usual &quot;spray junk at
suspected spot and listen for idle speed increase / white smoke in tailpipe
/ can of propane exploding in your hand :)&quot;  I have used incense sticks,
but they are not reliable...  I know building contractors use these to
determine leaks in HVAC systems, door and window jambs, etc.

Would even go for a good set of ideas how to build one!
