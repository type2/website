 coming out of the logo are repo'd or if someone might have an extra set.

Idont know.   but a 57 truck would have grey hubcaps with the VW emblem 
painted the same colour as the truck body

   One thing that I've never noticed before was the angle of the hand break!  
 I thought that it got bent to the side in an accident or something, but when 
 I looked underneath its supposed to be like that. I ran it through the shift 
 pattern and if the brake was straight it would run into it. All the buses 
 that I remember having, the handbrake was straight up to the right of the 
 boot. This one is almost even with it? When did vw stop doing this? Was this 
 some commercial vehicle thing?

when they changed the hand levers further forward around ch #501 xxx.  you 
should notice the levers are not in  the same place as the 63 you had, the 57 
takes a different floor mat.

 PS I am still looking for a 1ftx2ft piece of truck bed (doesn't need to be 
 pretty just solid with no dents).
 = = = = 
I am still wondering if the vanagon area over the engine has the same 
corregations- they do have the flat bumps,  if so there are lots in junkyards 
for patch fixes.
