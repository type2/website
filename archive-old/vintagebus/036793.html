Subject: The bus calendar has arrived
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hi everyone
The new calendar has finally arrived at my doorstep. The lay-out is really 
niceley done and includes a lot of cool busses. Hope everyone had the 
opportunity to purchase one.
I plan on hanging it where everyone can see at my desk at work. Spread the 
bus pics everywhere.
Hope everyone has a great holiday season,
Dave Barnes
