It is supposed to have that peak at the top, looks good to me.

Subject: [VB] Is my emblem straight?


&gt; I have an OG-paint emblem which I want to have
&gt; chromed, rather than buy a repop, since they are 99%
&gt; junk.
&gt; 
&gt; I want to ask the pro's here if this is straight, it
&gt; has a slight apex in it at the top. The apex is
&gt; symmetrical on each side, and looks like it matches
&gt; the front of DARTHVW. But there is a junky repop on
&gt; there right now so I can't hold it directly on it. The
&gt; repop doesn't have this bend in it at the top. Maybe
&gt; that tells me something right there?
&gt; 
&gt; What do you think?
&gt; 
&gt; Go here to see the OG:
