Yes, we were all looking forward at tearing your bus apart (not really
&lt;:~)).
Sh#t happens, I know. I spent 2 extra days on the engine of a 21 window I
needed to deliver to OCTO working out some bugs (gauges are for trash cans),
but it made it with flying colors after I learned NOT to look at the gauges
and rely on the old dipstick test. Anyway there were way to many Westys at
OCTO and yours would have been lost in the shuffle, even though I thought I
had seen yours at least 10 different times there. Familiafest is a good goal
and the true appreciation of your efforts will be more then emplified at
this very casual but awesome event. Looking forward to seeing your gem and
who knows the table trim should be done by then.

ronnie   DRIVE THEM

List:

The '59 Westfalia was ready,  I thought.  For all intent purposes it was
complete.  I even had the tent and poles packed up and ready.  I had caught
my second wind after the last 9 month power push to get this bus ready, 2
year resto in total.  The bus was finished, clean and ready to roll.  I had
a lunch packed for the trip, my spirits were up, this would be my first VW
meet in 3 years that I actually got to drive a VW to.

The last thing completed on my machine was the motor.  Not because I had put
it off, but because it just took that long to get all the pieces.  There
were a few bugs that popped up last week, but after a few short around-town
and freeway road trips, we thought as of Wednesday night that she was ready
for the LONG journey of 120 miles down to Orange County.

Joe Crockett, aka Mr. Transporter Talk, rolled up at 4:45 ready for a 5:00
pm departure.  Joe had been a huge technical resource along the way of this
resto.  5:10 we're on the road, naturally in bumper to bumper traffic.  We
knew it would open up just outside of Santa Barbara, and it did.  Ready to
get this 36hp up to speed, I shift into 4th and away we go.  For about ½
mile.  Keep in mind the bus cruised beautifully at 62 mph Wednesday night.
All of a sudden at around 56-58 it starts cutting out, violently.  I'm
literally doing the herky-jerky, coming close to banging my head on the
windshield.  We pull over in Carpinteria for inspection.  This problem had
occured last week, and it seemed to be determined that the cause was a
timing adjustment and a faulty vacuum advance, so it had been disconnected.

To make a long story short, we dicked with it until just after 10:00pm, when
it was decided that the bus just wouldn't make it.  We even consdiered
trailering it down there, but just didn't seem doable considering the time
restraints.  Joe asked if I still wanted to go down, but I was so depressed
that I decided against it.  I had worked so hard on this bus to have it
ready for this one day.  It had been my goal for two years now.  I was only
120 miles from where I needed to be and couldn't even get there.

I think what bummed me out the most was that I actually felt like I let a
lot of people down.  I had told countless folks that I would be there.  I
had parts to bring to people, Dave Easterwood, Steve Harris, made specific
plans to hook up with David Mayes and give him a ride from the hotel to the
meet, etc.  My buddy Dave Kroesen, (who was in his sweet ~new swr/bgr
hatchtop Westy, that I'm sure you all saw and loved) was sitting in the
hotel waiting for me to show, as he and I were going to set up the buses
next to each other, something we have planned on for 2 years now,  This was
the year!!!  I just felt like a big, stupid flake.  For God's sake, people
drive across the country and I can't even make it down the road a couple of
counties.  Man I felt like a loser.

I hope everyone had a great weekend.  I've been trying to look at the upside
to this weekend.  I suppose now I can continue to work on the camper and
complete it for a meet later on in the Summer.  I think I'll shoot for
Familienfest in August, as I've never been to that meet and I hear it's a
nice one.  The only drawback is the bus should be finished by then and I
won't be able to use the &quot;it's still under construction&quot; line that my good
friend Mr. Ellis recommended, when people start pointing out all of the
flaws of my restoration.

Sorry again to those that I promised I would be there.  I truly gave it my
best shot, but it just wasn't good enough.

Robert
