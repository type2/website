Totally agree with you on that one Buddy!
Bushings are a piece of cake to build if you have some basic machinist
skills and access to even an old lathe and some machinist grade measuring
tools.
I have made several of my own off and on over the years at a friends
shop...he does work for Boeing...lets me dig into the scrap barrels for
round stock he's tossed...some of the alloys being used out there now are
bullet proof...build a bushing for that steering box out of that stuff and
it'll NEVER wear out!!
Hmmmmmmmm.....sounds like maybe I should get some specs...and build a
couple hundred to sell to Bus Boys??????

&gt; Why not use bronze bushings, typically alloyed and engineered for just this
