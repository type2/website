4 lug wheels was a late night mistake. I meant small 5 as opposed to wide 5
wheels. I am not sure what sway bars fit the ball joint beams, but I am sure
that after-market suppliers such as Sway Away, Bus Boys, West Coast Metric,
and others could answer this question. I have been told that larger ones can
be installed, and the boy racer in me will likely do this if I can. I did have
one installed when I went to the 69 beam; along with a camber compensator, and
they made a big handling difference. I hope to have the albatross from Bus
Boys installed by spring, along with the discs from 73-79 vans.
