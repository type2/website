(hit the wrong enter button and it got sent not completed...)

Saturday afternoon is where I'm at.

Jorge from ABQ won the slow drag. Note to self, I need to offer my expertise
to Jim Burnite, I am great at turning a good engine into a 3-cylinder limper.
Jorge also won the quilt in the evening raffle. Then Beto showed up with his 2
girls. In case you are reading this, John Howard, he didn't have a wrist
band!!!  ;-) Tracy and Janet won the chilli cook off. Kudos to the &quot;2 chicks
chilli&quot;. No wonder Ronnie and Steve both have gruffy voices.

Saturday night. Grilled some porkchops. Like 50 of them. None left over.
Thanks for liking it folks. Got to go hang out next to some camp fires, but
missed
the Texas Holdem at VTO camp 2 nites in a row. Will have to find them the
next time.

Sunday morning. Time went unbelievably fast. I saw the local newspaper's
front page, Patricia finally gets the recognition with her quilt, as her
picture
was featured, front and center. It was a proud moment. Then the raffle for the
big items, and I really didn't know who won what stuff. I didn't win but drove
away feeling like one.

Got a little caravan coming back, with Tom Buese staying overnite, along with
Greg, Clara. and Shawn and family from ABQ. Mike Hansen had some engine
problem but since he was driving his 71 bus we'll pretend it has already been
taken
care of back in ABQ - in other words, let's not worry for him, hehe.

That was it. Fill in whatever I neglected to mention with lots of loud laughs
and beer bottles clinking, and occasionally a shot of taquila, and lots of
handshakes and hugs. You get the idea. Enough to make you feel like you should
have hitchhiked there, I hope.

Now who took my cellphone charger. Please mail it to me.
