well basically its almost stock just balanced.   Bosch Alt.  Pertronix 
Ignition, S&amp;S Header w single quiet pack

Came home last night to find the engine louvers were a smokin' so i open up 
the decklid and SIZZLE! $_at_!% there goes my fingers.  The engine lid was way 
hot and the engine was almost unbearable to just be close to.  So far I have 
checked the valves, timing, carb, exhaust, tin, cooler, fan, fuel system, 
plugs and ignition

all are right on.  Now im wondering what I should be looking closely for when 
I pull it out and tear it down to the longblock.  I know the possibilties are 
bearings, burned valve and all that but just want to know what the tell-tale 
signs are.

Thanks
