Subject: Re: [VB] Where are all the middle seats?

Well, it was Friday, and I was really only just wondering, while searching
for a matching sock.  I don't need one right now, but I am in the Northeast
(CT).  It's more like, why were they taken out in the first place, but I
guess the answer lies somewhere in the economics of supply and demand.  Too
bad.  Sad but true that the dollar has no morals, and that the $um of parts
and pieces from a bus that gets cut up and parted out is worth so much more
money than the bus as a whole.  Both of my busses probably would have gone
that route if they lived somewhere else.  That yard you speak of sounds very
familiar.  A similar one near me got repossessed and leveled while I was
away at college.  There used to be at least ten splitties lined up visible
from the road, and countless others and who knows what lurking in the
various barns and property in back.  There are now two lovely raised ranches
there, with splotches of grass that just won't grow :)

&gt; there's one here from a '60 dd standard.  i saw one of these go for over
&gt; $2000 on ebay last year and this one is just as mint as that one was.
dont
&gt; know anyone looking for one in the northeast do ya?  i just dropped off a
&gt; full width from a 65 at the selinsgrove show.  i do have a sneeking
&gt; suspicion where there are a couple more in this junkyard that hasnt been
&gt; open in about 15 years, but the owner is old and crazy, so he rarely lets
&gt; anyone under 60 years old in there.  if you are in the area some night and
&gt; wanna try to get one, give me a call, but bring some dark clothes and a
ski
&gt; mask.  a heavy jacket is good to have also because he likes to shoot rock
&gt; salt at us.

&gt; &gt; I don't know, but if you find a 1960 or earlier 2/3 seat, I'd be more
then
&gt; &gt; happy to trade you the 1960-61 full width middle seat I have!!

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Seriously, where have all the middle seats gone, if they aren't in any
of
&gt; &gt; the busses I've seen for sale?  Is anyone sitting on one right now?
