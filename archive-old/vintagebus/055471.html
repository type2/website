Subject: Type 1 in a 74 bus

------=_NextPart_000_0009_01C14C51.4941DE40
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

So I'm considering buying a 74 bus that has a type 1 motor in it.  I =
sort of like the idea in that it'll be more similar to my 60 and it =
won't have any FI stuff - that I don't know anything about.  Anyone have =
any tips on what I should look for in a bus that's been converted like =
this.  My plan is to use this bus as a winter daily driver.  I figure if =
I keep the underside nice and clean it and spray it with chain oil a =
couple times over the winter, it should be fine.  I just don't want to =
drive my 60 in the Canadian winter besides the elements there are people =
who are poor drivers in the elements.

TIA
