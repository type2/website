&gt;My 66 has the original 1/3 2/3 bench in front and '68 &gt;rear and 2/3 middle basketweave seats in the cargo &gt;area. I'd like to cover all seats with Vintage &gt;Leatherette...Should the upholstery between these two &gt;years be interchangeable? What's the diff?


yes...i was faced with a similar issue a few years ago with a 71, i know bay window, but read on, i bought a &quot;bay window&quot; middle seat and it didn't fit in my 71. i'll spare you a long story of how i aquired this knowledge, but it involved a 48&quot; set of calipers and several trips to the wrecking yards, and lots of &quot;can i measure your seat&quot; &quot;no mamm, the seat in your bus&quot;. i originally assumed that all bays are the same and all splits are the same, not true, i'm not talking about all the trim and jail bars or the upholstery and ashtrays but am referring to the seat frames themselves, and do they match the factory floor mounts.

60-73 middle full bench seats can be grouped together, a 68 bench should fit in your 66, i just coordinated the purchase of a 3/4 bench seat from a 72 had it covered in the smooth forest green 32oz vinyl from sewfine and put it in a 62 for a friend. it didn't have the grab bars, but the owner was happy to buy a $50 seat frame vs a 67 or earlier for $350+. she decided that the grab bars and &quot;other trim&quot; were not worth $300 to her.

74-79 middle full bench seats will not fit in your 66 or in my old 71, i got one, paid big money for it, if you want it, it yours for free.

the rear bench seats have the same year break.

earlier than 60 no idea has i didn't have access or a need to know.

front seats did change with the split/bay year change, i bought a sewfine cover from thom f, that he purchased for his 55? it fit the bench in my 63 single cab perfectly.

ok way more detail that anyone wanted to know...

My opinion is to spend a little extra money and buy covers from SewFine or have them sewn locally or do what i'm doing a take an upholstery class at the community college.
