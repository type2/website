&gt; Do any of the experts ; ) out there know the part # for the
&gt; master cyl of a 70 bus. Last trip to flaps produced 3 diff ones. Closest
one was
&gt; an Indian piece of dubious quality, cheap and looked it.


Could be a 211 600 021 Q or T.  Q fits 68-69, and T fits 70, but the change
actually occurred late early in the '70 model year, so if you have a '70
made late in '69 you could have either.  The Q is available in German only,
the T in Indian or German.  The parts books also incorrectly list the AA as
fitting, with the notation that it is for &quot;models with servo only.&quot;  Since
brake servos/disk brakes weren't added until '71, it is highly unlikely that
you would use an AA.
