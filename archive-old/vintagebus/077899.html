From: Claralw_at_aol_dot_com:

&gt; It 's stupid how people have dumb sterotypes about all VW buses being 
&gt; driven by stoned hippies smoking bongs while driving

Yeah, man - no way would I use one while driving.  The NOS in-dash 
units came with an interlock switch to prevent that -- the carb won't 
close when the coil's hot (brilliant and unhackable, especially when 
the short-term memory's gone), so you just suck air.  Strictly doobs 
while on the road, I say -- preferably sized to match the cigar 
lighter.  What was the question?

&gt; I can't be the only person annoyed by stupid middle aged clean cut 
&gt; wierdo strangers with minivans who come up to me in parking lots 
&gt; saying &quot;WOWW, Woodstock mannn!&quot;  making joint smoking gestures.

That does drive me nuts.  &quot;Hippie bus!&quot;  Like they know.  &quot;Bite me,&quot; I 
smile, and flash a peace sign while I drive away with my &quot;Karma&quot; and 
&quot;stopthedrugwar_dot_org&quot; bumper stickers on the back.

&gt; If that was my scene, I wouldn't have it together to have a decent bus.

Now don't go gratuitously reinforcing another dumb stereotype.  What 
would Jeff and Tracy think? (http://tinyurl_dot_com/wa06).
