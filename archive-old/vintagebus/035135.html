As some of my posts have suggested, and Thom's review of the truck before I

purchased, the wiring on my '63 crew was pretty messy.  An incomplete 6v to

12v conversion and a lot of disconnected wires.  The fuse block is cracked

and hanging 2 inches below the holding frame :)

did you replaced the fuse block?   I have a couple spares if you haven't
 . . .. . . . 



  2)  The lack of speedo lighting was the result of a blown 6v bulb in

there, replaced with a new 12v bulb and cleaned contacts.  The socket is on

the left side of the speedo, reaching behind from the left side.  Just pull

out and clean contacts.  Worked!

there should be a light on each side of the speedo - so feel unde rthe right
side and check the bulb in that bulb holder too.

Unexpected Discoveries

======================



My wiper motor must be the original 6volt one!  I am able to run it off a 3

amp blade fuse and they now move back and forth at super high speed.   No

blown fuse, works great. 
....- I need to slow it own.   I'd rather work

out a voltage drop than to replace the wiper motor with 12v.  For my first

attempted, I ordered a rheostat to see if I can work out a way that allows

me to control the speed through variable voltage lowering...  I'll report

later how this works (Seattle weather gives me lots of chances to test).


-  ---  --
please post about it - I am interested in a rheostat too.
 . .     .
I recommend finding a colour wiring diagram and keping to the original colours
used AMAP.  The colours actually mean things- brown is always ground, red hot
all the times, black hot w/ ignition on, etc.    These colours are easy to
find, but some  are not and I use pieces of old VW wiring harness.  I've been
looking in to find souces, but it seems I'd have to buy in bulk.

Going back later when it's done with the right colours is like going back
later when the bolts have been greased- much pleasanter and easier to work on.
