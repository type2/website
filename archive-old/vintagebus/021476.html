on it. Now, since my tranny work was done, I have the
supposedly easier to adjust wing not adjuster. Does
anyone have some tips on how to adjust this puppy?
Mine is STUCK.  I held the cable still with some vice
grips and all, but the wing nut does not want to move
in either direction.  Any help would be greatly
appreciated. Thanks!

haven't had problems adjusting a clutch cable that had been greased.   Yes, 
by hand even.  Yup, If the motor is out, wipe some GREASE, the magic stuff, 
on the threaded bit of the cable, and twist the adjustment nut to get the 
grease under it in those threads.  deinately when installing cable or 
wingnut.    But there are times when it is stuck or sticky.   I happened upon 
an itty bitty adjustable wrench,  and it can hold an ear (wing?) and turn  
that wing nut.      Generally (90%) the wingnuts turn rather than get mangled 
and deeared.
