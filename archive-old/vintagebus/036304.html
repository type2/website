Subject: Single Cab &quot;Ute&quot; Sorry, Pick up!!!!

For us in Australia, we call pick up's, &quot;Ute's&quot;. Don't worry, you will catch on! Yes there is a bit of sarcasm in this, :)
The cab roof on these SC's are about double the height again of a &quot;normal SC&quot; with no air vents on the out side along the length on the bed. The air then gets channeled to the engine compartment.
Have a look at the pic. I will scan another one asap to show the side.
Thanks
