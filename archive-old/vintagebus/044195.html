All this fuel filter talk encouraged\reminded me to go back and check all that stuff on my 66 (with a 71 engine) and to quote Gomer Pyle &quot;SURPRISE, SURPRISE, SURPRISE!&quot;, my fuel filter was leaking raw gas into the engine compartment.  Well, definitely NOT wanting to drive it any distance like this I hoofed it to the FLAPS down the street from my office and replaced the fuel filter and lines.  Now here's my question: I have noticed that the new fuel filter does NOT stay full of gas.  When I turn the engine off, all the gas runs out of the filter back into the line, and when it's running the fuel only comes up about 1/3 of the way into the filter. To me, this seems like it AIN'T QUITE RIGHT. The old filter stayed full always.  So could it be that the fuel line I put on is too big? 1/4 inch line was as close as the FLAPS had, it looked close but?!?! Maybe my fuel pump is wearing out??  Maybe I'm just being paranoid??
