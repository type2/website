Hello All....
 Is there a way to tighten up the front door window
latches so they dont rattle? One rattled pretty good
so I took out the flathead screw, cleaned everything
up, &amp; now its seems it wont tighten up enough to clamp
to the glass, and rattles worse:( Am I missin sumthin?
 And for you S/C &amp; D/C owner, or any one who has done
sumthin similar... Gonna cut the rust outa the gates
this weekend &amp; start on them. Tryin to find the best
way to get the POR-15 down in the channels to protect
from this happenin again. Only way I see to is to take
the gate off, put a funnel in it &amp; fill it up:) Messy,
but doable...ideas?
Thanks for any help,
David Pierce
