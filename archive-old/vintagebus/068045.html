Subject: POR15 discounted at The Bus Depot

Just a note that I am now selling POR15 rust preventative paint for cheaper
than it is sold factory-direct.  This is the product that's been
oft-mentioned on the List as the best rust preventative on the market.

In my opinion, no rust repair job or seal replacement should be done without
it. I have used it myself on my own busses and swear by it.  You do need to
apply it properly (i.e degrease the area before applying as they instruct),
and I have been told by the manufacturer that if you want to primer over it,
you should do it while the POR15 is still tacky (whereas if you paint
directly over it you should wait until it's dry).  But if you take the
minimal time to apply it properly, the stuff's amazing.  It really does
work, if not 100% as claimed (their claims are pretty lofty; i.e. no rust
again ever), then at least 75%, which is still far better than anything else
out there.  At absolute worst it will retard rust regeneration; at best it
will stop it in its tracks. In either case it's well worth the minimal
expense.

Part # is POR15.  Order link is at
