Subject: engine siezed

why yes it does, it definetly sounds like the same thing i had on the motor i 
got with my deluxe.
it would turn and then sieze solid about a whole turn either way.
take the valve covers off and pick up the head nut ,that came off and is 
jamming up under the rocker.
i too thought i had a serious engine problem, but what a nice surprise to see 
that nut under the rocker.
good luck with it , i hope thats all you have also.
