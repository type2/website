Subject: 63 project


Hey all...I hate to do this, but with the unexpected notice in the mail
about the shop getting torn down in under 3 months now...I have to do it

as I have no place else to go with it.

my 63 is up for grabs
I'm in Oshkosh, WI

you can see it at www.luckyboys_dot_com/bus.htm

this bus will need the following
wiring harness
seals...all of them ($400 or so from Wolfsburg West)
2 inner rockers, 2 outer rockers, maybe front floors, and some cargo
floor.  Just about all is cut out, and prepped, and just needs the metal

welded in
it will also need tires...but the ones that are on it hold air..so thats

just when it gets to see the road

what it has:
front seats - could use recovering
full rear seat - bottom could use recovering
nice uncut dash
speedos, blinkers, taillights, headlights
it has all of the glass, and a little extra
has both bumpers - rear is not correct (it is a 67 bumper) and is
slightly mangled...but its a rear bumper none the less

it will also need brake work...as far as I know it was sitting for a
while.

the ugly:
nose is dimpled and has a gash that has been tastefully bondo'd
rear drivers side beltline was hit at sometime and is dented...but not
horribly..its just dimpled where it was pounded out a bit.
rear corners are nice
the bus was completely media blasted and then primed with Rustoleum
primer, and painted with Rustoleum...don't laugh..the stuff is easy to
work with, looks nice, and if you do bodywork later on...you don't have
to get the whole bus repainted...just go buy a can of rustoleum.

I think I have an extra front beam and trans from a 65...but I'm not too

sure.

I could include a motor if you like...but at a little higher price.

If anyone is seriousely interested...please email me and make me an
offer.  I have spent the last few months gathering bits and pieces for
it.  I also have some extra brake parts for it.
I would also be interested in a partial trade for a runner...or near
runner split that I could put in my driveway and not have to store.

I hate to see it go, but I can't spend this much money this fast.

tell your friends
thanks,
