&lt;&lt; Anyone out there running kadrons, 1776 and a stock exhaust? I'm
 considering pulling off my extractor so I can get a little more heat
 with the stock muffler. I know it will be restrictive, but will it
 overheat the engine? I have stock valves and a stock cam, so it
 shouldn't be much of a problem. I could put my 30 pict -1 back on, but
 it ices up when its chilly out and the duals do not ice up.

Hi Ev,
Well we have not tried dual carbs yet and the largest engine we have gone with
is a 1641cc.  If you keep your RPMs between 1,500-3,000 and only hit 3,500
momentarly when shifting then the stock muffler with you carbs jetted right
will probably do well.  One of our friends tried the stock muffler with his
1776cc, but we do not know the rest of the details that he has redone to the
engine to work with the stock muffler.  He says it has restricted his engine
by using the stock muffler. We have been thinking about this problem and if he
has tried different carb jets.  Then maybe running a bug muffler with two bus
tail pipes to either side would do the trick of removing the back pressure if
that is the problem.   Eric &amp; Barb
