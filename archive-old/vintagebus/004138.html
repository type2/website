yeah West coast metric had (or still has?) one. After having the plating
shop loose ALL their hardware they decided to just buy a whole other bus and
then make the one missing every nut and bolt imaginable into a trailer. They
shortened the bus and still used the nose. they also lowered the INSIDE of
the bed about 3 feet(both were single cabs(58?) so they could haul rubber
and stuff around.

&gt;Has anyone ever made or seen a splittie carcus made into some sort of
&gt;trailer? Pictures would be cool too!
