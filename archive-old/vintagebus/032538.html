possible, but unlikely.  does first pop?  i'd check it and maybe play
around with it a little and see if it does anything, and also check front
shift rod bushing, coupler screws being tight both front and rear and no
play in any of them or the rods, rear coupler. did you tighten the mounts
in the proper sequence?  did you jam the shift rods while installing, and
maybe have bent one?  make sure everything is good and tight, and if no
luck, take it to the dude who did it and have him inspect it, or a
reputable shop.  it may not last 20K if you've broken or bent something.

Could it be that I have the shifter adjusted incorrectly?  Etc.
