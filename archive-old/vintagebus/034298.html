New old bus owner here with a question.

I have trouble getting my swingaxle tranny into gear. It isn't grinding,
just shifting into gears that aren't there. I put my bus up on blocks and
with the tranny in neutral, the driver's side wheel spins lazily and
passenger side wheel turns at a pretty good clip.

Simple adjustment?
Throw out bearing?
Slipping clutch?
Shift bushing?
All of the above?

&gt; Would you mind sending one of those extra walk-throughs my way?

&gt; &gt; Ok do you know of anyone who has owned a 65 delux bus with a bench? It
&gt; &gt; seems
&gt; &gt; every 65 delux bus  I come across on the net is a walkthru model. I am
&gt; &gt; sort of in
&gt; &gt; the market for a bench model  for a 65 delux if they made them or not
&gt; &gt; for that
&gt; &gt; year.21 window models only.
