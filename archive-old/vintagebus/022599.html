I have a small pop-up shelf which I scrounged from a camper years ago, and
have had kicking around all this time It's slightly narrower than the cargo
door, with rounded corners and a speckled formica-type top.  Comes with an
authentic grateful dead sticker.  It has two supports which collaps and let
the shelf hang down.  It's in excellent condition.  I was going to put it
in my '67 years ago, but I burned the bus before I got the chance to
install the shelf.

Whaddaya gimme for it?  Let the bidding begin!
