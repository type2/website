Subject: RE: [VB] name this post

I actually have some ink used by wire harness makers to mark wires... I
fried the main harness in my 75 scirroco and I rewired it myself, making
sure all the color codes were correct about 10 years ago.  Now that was a
fun task.   But making that spiral strip is a real pain and it's difficult
to make even.

That way you can deal with yourself!  Like a 12 step program in one!
