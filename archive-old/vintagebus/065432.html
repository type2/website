Subject: Re: [VB] what happens without the engine lid?

The air flow at the black of a bus has the air from under the bus curling up 
and smacking the back of the bus.  This is well illustrated by a bus that 
drips oil, the oil is smeared all over the back of teh bus.   so hot air from 
the road and off teh engine  get smacked up there, and if the engine lid is 
off the engine draws in that air rather than depending on the stock vents.    
engine would probably like the cooler air than the warmer air.  Funny thing 
is that a well sealed engine compartment is pressurized.    Probably the best 
thing to get it to run cooler is get all the engine compartnt seals (engine 
to body, engine lid, grommets etc) all nice and make sure all the tin is good.

Then again you could hook up a temp guage and drive with the lid open, and 
with it closed, and tell us the difference.

&lt;&lt;  Also it seems most drag bugs have the lids
 removed.  Plus all the sandrails and buggies have
 completely exposed engines.
      If I remove the engine lid will it help the
 engine run cooler?  If it is beteer to leave it on,
 how would louvers, a whole bunch, or small amout
 change the airflow?  I have an extra lid, so I can
 leave one nice.  Who knows about the aerodynamics of
 the engine bay?
