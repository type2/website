Subject: Different Heads

More engine questions folks.

While looking at the heads ('71 dual port) on the bench tonight I
noticed that one of them has been replaced/changed.  One head is the
original '71  113 101375A (35.5mm X 32mm) and the other is from a '74
043 101 375A (35.5mm X 32mm)

Will there be any great difference between the two?  They look
identical.  Should I have a matching pair, or is the fact that the
valves and ports the same the most important?

BTW, no cracks that I can see.  I don't have a valve spring compressor,
so I can check the guides.

Rebuild or  New just because, or can I clean and reuse?


Thanks

Steve
