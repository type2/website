Todd,
	That sounds like a great idea to me. I would've replied via p-mail but
apparently Earthlink has a squabble with AOL every time I've tried to
e-mail you in the past about the nosecose/shift lever seal/bushing
combo....

Thanks,

Jason Black

&gt; parts and price list for both the 36mm'd and 46mm'd
&gt; nutted redux boxes.  Just post me a note off-list and
&gt; depending on how much traffic I get I will either post
&gt; directly back or make a 'general' broadcast.
