Here are the ballpark values for a '67 deluxe bus from the 'Old Cars
Price Guide', a periodical (that's 'magazine' for anyone from Palm Beach
County) available at your local Barnes and Noble:

1.  Trailer queen, never driven--$23000
2.  Superior resto or excellent original--$16100
3.  Good amateur resto, all presentable and serviceable--$9200
4.  Driveable, deteriorated resto--$4600
5.  Needs complete resto--$2750
6.  Parts car--$850

Just like the Fox News Channel sez, 'we report, you decide'!

&gt; I am finally putting the finishing touches on my '67 deluxe.  I have gone
&gt; all out on this restoration and have everything as stock as possible.  There
&gt; are a few places where evidence of fixing is seen.  The driver's side floor
&gt; has a sheet metal piece on it (about a half a square foot), and a few places
&gt; at the front of the cargo floor have been patched as well.  Unfortunately, I
&gt; need to sell this thing.  My question is, what is the price range for a bus
&gt; like this?  Also, are there any commonly overlooked areas that can increase
&gt; or decrease the final value?
