     My name is Charles and im a vw addict! I have owned 3 vws first two were
 bugs 65' &amp; 59'
 my last one (probably not my last) I just got a 63' panel  bus. It is in
 half way good shape I paid 400.00 for it (that is why I have it, it was a
 good deal) it runs I received no keys with it, the back door was locked and
 the engine was lock with no handle(and the lock was broke could not get the
 door open I did though I need some new hinges anyone!)
..................
congrats on the new bus!   did you know a 63 did not come with a handle for 
the engine lid?  The bus came with a square key aka church key.  a 
screwdriver willl also work.  insert the square key, and turn it clockwise to 
open the engine door.   If you are lucky it will have the elbow prop still 
there- it is on the right.  it self latches when you pull the door up, but do 
not shove the lid down to shut it like what works with the spring props.   
lift the door slightly up with your left hand, push the lid latch forward- 
straight towards the front of the bus, and it will unlatch, you can let the 
lid down at this point.  but probably somebody already broke the stay.  They 
came with a chromed cover for the keyway, with a little teardrop thingy you 
push to one side like on the gas door, but usually the engine lid chrome 
doohickeys are gone, but I think they are reproed.  You can also get a church 
key, they are reproed, probably some FS at the shows
