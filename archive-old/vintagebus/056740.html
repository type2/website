 how do i wire my radio so that it turns off when i turn the key all he way 
 off, but can be on when the key is in the first position, before i turn the 
 car on?is that possible?
  &gt;&gt;
attach power wire to second fuse from right, but leaving ig on so you can get 
radio is not good for your points.
