&gt; Man, are prices going crazy or what?

&gt; $10,500 for a starter project.  Paint &amp; body is another easy $5k-$10k,
&gt; rubber &amp; interior bits another $5k, easy.  Stuff you didn't think about,
&gt; lessay $2k.  That's a lot of change behind the sofa.  You'd be breaking

Having seen this bus in person many times, I too was surprised at the
price. I was surprised at how *low* it is. This is one nice bus. I dont
think Craig is being fair to it by the description he gives. It is not
at the point most of us ( including your last couple projects, Thom)
think of as &quot;starter&quot;...  I've seen Craig at the shows for three years
spending money on correct parts for this bus. 

The tasteful trailer lights do nothing but make the thing legal to
drive... they are not cut in, but are there until the correct ones,
which come with, are  installed. Seems like I've been hearing about
those correct lights not lasting long on buses parked outside??? There
is an argument for trailer lights right off..

It doesnt need any $5-$10k in paint and body. Has most all the $5k in
rubber and interior bits...hell, maybe he should part it out...from your
figures he might do better...:)
If I had $10k I would stick a headliner in it and go.
