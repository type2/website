Subject: VW places near Vegas

I am off on a trip for work to Vegas this weekend.  Are there any
shop's, junk yards, listmembers or parts shops in that area that anyone
can tell me about.  I will have a little free time to look around.

Specifically, i would like to locate a 2/3 middle seat to haul home.
Also some deluxe trim. (65 Samba)
Please let me know if anyone has any leads

Thanks
Matthew
