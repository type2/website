Jerry,

I have to agree with Greg Noble on this one. To give an award to an obviously 
unsafe, illegal 350 mile road trip, really does send the wrong message to 
people who view this hobby or business, via the Internet, magazines or the 12 
o'clock news.
Sure the guy was excited about his first bus, but to endanger not only 
himself but others who only see VW buses as the slow moving object in front 
of their Dodge or Chev is irresponsible. He could have easily taken pictures 
of the thing and shown it off that way. 
Unfortunately, more and more new VW people feel they can get away with not 
following common sense or common law, because stunts like this are heralded 
as folklore or martyrism.
We are by no means, knocking or ragging on the daily drivers out there that 
spend countless hours and money every month wrenching on their bus just to 
keep it on the road. At least, daily drivers are registered, have working 
headlights, taillights, four matching tires, glass, insurance, and a lot of 
personal pride. It's the daily drivers out there that keep the hobby alive by 
promoting the hobby 24/7.
However, we feel that promoting VW's should be done responsibly by following 
the same auto laws as those that view the hobby from the outside.
Enough said.
