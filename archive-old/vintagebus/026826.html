Subject: Re: [VB]  Fire extinguishers?

OK. True fire story here. When I was 19 (eons ago), and in the Air
Force, me and my buds were sittin around gettin pie eyed at 4 oclock in
the morning. Suddenly we noticed some flickering lights coming through
the blinds onto the wall and I casually remarked about them (hey, check
that out). Lenny, the quick thinkin volunteer fireman in the group
looked out the window and in a flash was down the hall, grabbin the fire
extinguisher of the wall as he went. There, in the middle of the street
was a comet with the hood up and flames engulfing the carborator (why he
didnt close the hood, I will never understand). Lenny quickly
extinguished it and after a few kind words, the guy drove on. He had to
be about the luckiest doooood on the planet.

Now lets see. . . bus content. . . I believe there was a nice unrestored
63 deluxe parked nearby :)
