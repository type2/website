Here's a short version of my weekend:

Friday
Left at 4 am on the first annual Phoenix-to-the-Classic Barndoor caravan.  3 Barndoors present, including big NEATO dude Dave Easterwood in his '54 Kombi.  It was cool to meet Dave, nice guy.  A fellow from Tucson came along in his '64 21-window with us, which proceeded to strip out a rear axle nut a few hours later.  The tire and drum popped off the axle and, as you can imagine, body damage and a nice skid mark was left as he quickly left the highway for the shoulder of Interstate 10.  The damage was repaired quickly and we were on our way.  The destination was Yucapia and the ex-Christmas tree farm estate of Rich Yost.  A few of us got separated and bad directions found us trying to drive up a dirt road toward what we thought was the intended destination.  Van Bondo almost got hung up in his '54 Ambulator and Scott Hall almost slid down the side of the hill in his '55 Euro Single Cab trying to pass him.  Sadly, I forgot to capture the moment on film for future embarassment i!

Saturday
OCTO was great!  I arrived a bit early and drove right in, no line, no waiting.  Met quite a few people I'd only talked to on the phone or email or seen on the list.  Great turnout, maybe 200 Buses?  Sadly, my friend had his brakes fail in his '57 Single outside the meet and he met the full tow package rear end of a brand new Suburban.  Suburban - scratched, Single Cab - massive nose damage.  Found quite a few things, including  a set of lever shocks in great condition.  Now I can stop hounding people for them.  Wait, I need another set for my truck...  :)

Cruised out to Huntington Beach in the afternoon, blowing off the Toy and Literature show, had lunch, relaxed, etc..  Headed over to the home of Scott Fraser later to check out his under-construction Type IV setup and pick up a few things.  His '60 Double Cab is going to be one sweet setup.  He even answered all my I-don't-know-crap-about-a-Type-4 questions.  Thanks again for everything, Scott!

Sunday
The Classic.  Yep, the line to get in was even more screwed up than last year.  And I didn't think that was possible...  They need to get some serious organization going there.  The turn out was incredible, they ran out of parking spots in most sections.  Swap meet was bigger than last year, prices were typical Classic but there was some good deals.  A lot of I've-never-seen-that-before-in-person stuff, too.  I didn't buy much, maybe my best score was 2 NOS early shifters, one went immediately to a friend, you didn't believe I was looking for stuff for you, did you?  :)

Monday
Drove back to Phoenix, my 36hp was kicking a** on the hills, 4th gear almost the whole way, 55 mph, oil temp. was around 215 F in ~105F heat.  Made it back in 2 hours less than last year!

All told, ~900 miles, zero problems with my Bus.  Oil is even still clean!
