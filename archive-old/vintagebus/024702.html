  *Vroom!*, pedal feels good and I have free movement all the way to the

  floor. It doesn't stick anymore.

Steve and anyone else who may have had this problem....did your
accelerator stick
with the throttle open, or was it sticky trying to push the pedal down?
My accelerator
has had a &quot;catch&quot; when first applying pressure to the pedal. It seems to
release OK
and has never stuck with the throttle open, but it's annoying. I've only
tried the
obvious lubrication so far....haven't tried anything radical yet.
    Thanks!
