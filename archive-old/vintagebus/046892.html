&lt;&lt; Didn't 65 doors use swing out handles? Or are they the same as 67

 handles? &gt;&gt;
Hi Karl,
No.  The pull out handled front bus doors ended about NOV63 at chassi number 
1 22 025.  From there on the push button outer handles were used, and of 
course the stamps, and thusly the doors were modified for use with these 
later outer handles.  Yes, the only real differance in the later (1964-67) 
outer handles is the key pattern used in thier tumblers.  Though the 1967 
outer cargo door handle, and tumbler seems to be another 1967 nightmare one 
year only set of parts!
