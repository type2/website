   We have stayed on the south rim, nice state campground. fill out the 
envelope form on your way in and drop it in the box with the payment. We were 
there 2/26/99 and it got down to 22 degrees! We had flannel sheets, two 
sleeping bags, wool blanket, comforter, and down comfortor. It was nice and 
toasty until you venture out to get dressed, then Brrrr!
   Beautiful place, some parts may still be closed, but the visitor center is 
open. You can read my journal entries from it here:

&gt; 
&gt; The Grand Canyon isn't in a city.  It cuts through about half of northern
&gt; arizona!
&gt; 
&gt; From Las Vegas, you might want to go to the north rim.
