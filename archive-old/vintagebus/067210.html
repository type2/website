Subject: Re: [VB] Back on list w/ a fine(?) vehicle!

&gt;I agree with Stan. I'm no expert on Single Cabs but I've seen other low
&gt;mileage VW's and they sure
&gt;didn't have all these problems. Sounds more like it had 126,000 miles on
&gt;it. As far as the price
&gt;goes did you shop around to see what similar cars in that condition were
&gt;going for before you agreed
&gt;on a price?


I really can't believe you guys.  &quot;all these problems&quot;??!!

I gave a very detailed description, and I do notice the details.  This
thing is in better shape than any pickup I've seen in these parts in at
least ten years.

I've never driven any bus with an actual 126K that didn't have sloppy
sterring, shot synscros, gear whine, etc, etc.  This has none of that.
That's why the 26K *might* be actual, but I am skeptical.

My theory is that it was rear-ended and put in a barn somewhere, then found
and 'restored' some ten years back.  It's been a garaged toy ever since.

I think it would Ebay for at least $6,000 - $7,000.
