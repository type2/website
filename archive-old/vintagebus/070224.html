&gt;   My new (yes NOS) westfalia hitch will be here very soon (customs has
&gt; decided they need to X-ray my container that has been in the port since 2
&gt; Fridays ago) and I will see how it mounts up.

Anybody that saw the relatively HUGE 1952 Rod and Reel trailer (compared
to a puck) I towed to last years Classic could attest to the strength of
the real Westfalia tow hitch and its mounting methods. Karl and his RAL
orange DC was parked next door and can vouch for this.  The trailer
weighs at least 1500 and most likely more.

Now, I won't be doing that again with the stock 1600 and tranny, but the
hitch had NO problem and in fact the whole thing towed like a dream....a
very anemic slow dream, but a dream none the less.

The Westy hitch mounts in 4 distinct locations with 10 different bolts.

2 bolts in the underside of the bumper blade
2 bolts (one on each side) at the bumper/frame location
4 bolts (through welded on hitch bracket) through the tranny cradle (non
round tube cradle)
2 U-bolts around the torsion tube on either side of the transmission.

Once mounted this thing is STOUT.  Unfortunately you have to remove it
to change the sump plate/screen or to drop the motor.  A MAJOR PAIN! 
Have a look at what they look like.  BTW there are 3 or 4 styles of
split bus Westy hitch.  They were made well in to the 70's (mine was
made in '71 for a split though)
