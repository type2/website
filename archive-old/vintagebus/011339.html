I recommend this show for all bus enthusists.I went last year and had
a great time. Saw a large collection of split window buses.From barndoors
to campers,singlecabs,doublecabs,standards,kombis,and deluxes. They
also have a good swap area and you get to meet alot of great people.The
caravan after the show to the bug jam is great fun and you won't see so
many buses on the road east of the Misissippi ! Hope to see you there.
