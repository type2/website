&lt;&lt; just doing a tuneup, oil change etc yesterday, and I noticed that when I
 pulled the valve covers off there was a smell of gas...i don't recall ever
 sensing this smell before, any ideas what this means?
 
 I also noted while checking the gap, the piece i think is called the rocker,
 could move if i tried to move it with my hand...i thought that this should 
not
 be able to move freely...am i mistaken
 
 thanks for any info on this...

pull the dipstick and sniff it.  Does it smell like gas?  if so it means.... 
you have gas in your oil, which you smell when you pull the valve covers.  
Since gasoline is a poor lubricant, change you oil, and find out how it is 
getting into it.  Probably your fuel pump.  Pull the fuel pump off the bus, 
the plasticy bas thing should be filled with grease, if the base has gas in 
it the pump leaks, get a good pump.

when you check the valve gap, the swinging thing on the rod bolted to the 
head should wiggle back and forth .006&quot; on the valve you are adjusting.  
ALthough at certain points in the cycle of the motor it will be closed.  If 
you are talking about the rod bolted to the head, no that should not wiggle, 
those 2 113mm nuts shoul be torqued to what 18ft lbs.
