Since its Friday I need to bemoan the fact that Wolfsburg sent me the wrong 
headliner kit for my bug... Aieeeee!!  They are good enough about the 
exchange but my youngest is not the most patient with how long it takes to 
resto a &quot;Bug&quot;... like I said Friday.  Those kits are about as intimidating 
as my first effort at painting a car!

Sigh... at least I am sitting in the garage looking at my Bus, makes it all 
better (had to ref a bus somewhere).   Wish I could make the shows in SoCal 
this weekend.
