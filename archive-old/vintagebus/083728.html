I find it unlikely that the spark from the switch or the opener was what
set the fuel off.  To do so, a combustible mixture would have to exist at
the switch or opener, both of which are a fair distance off of the floor.
OTOH, if there was some sort of spark at floor level, it is more likely
that a combustible mixture existed there.  Ignition is only possible if
the fuel/air mixture is in a narrow range.  Too rich or too lean and it
won't light.

This is why many municipalities require that water heaters placed in
garages be on pedistals 18 inches above the floor.  Gas fumes are heavy,
and therefore tend to keep the combustible mixture near the floor.

Still, Murphy says that if you aren't careful you end up burned.  When
draining the tank you pretty much have to drain the last into a bucket, so
I make sure to use a plastic bucket (no sparking on concrete) and to make
sure that the wrench I use to loosen the tank outlet nut is placed a long
way away before I completely remove the nut.  I also remove all metal
objects from my pockets before spilling gas.  No sparks, please!
