&gt; Hello Everyone!
&gt;
&gt;     I was wondering if any one new of someone on the California Coast
that
&gt; clear coats aluminum or Anodizes the pieces and which one would be the
best
&gt; way to go. I would like to protect my beltline trim on my 67 deluxe
after it
&gt; gets back from the polishing shop.

Okay, once more for the world...

&gt;From my own experiences during my restoration:

The trim pieces are said not to anodize properly as they are very soft and
a strange german aluminium alloy, so -

You need a clear coat such as the one I used, which is (okay, everyone
with me together):

Crystal Top Coat, from POR15 folks (see www.por15_dot_com).

It must be applied according to the directions, in a paint booth, with a
sprayer.

Basically, one applies five superlight coats one after another, feathering
it on, til it is nicely coated. You hang the parts, put on your aspirator
and mask and gloves, and begin walking around, spraying light coats
everywhere. It must not drip, or you get to laquer-thinner that piece back
down to clean and dry, and start over on it.

I did the work on my trim pieces, so I know the above.

Your nearest POR distributor as of 1996, is (was):

The Finished Look

Sacramento, CA

800-827-6715

Get a quart of it - it's fun and tastes good too!

And make sure your trim pieces are immaculately clean.

Mine still look like the day I sprayed them, October 95, though the bus
does live in a garage. Nice and chrome-like.
