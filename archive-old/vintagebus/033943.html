Hi Rex,
The former is most likely going to stare at you like you were from the moon.  
The latter might be able to help you depnding if they have knowledgable volks 
behind the counter or if not then they are most likely they will try to sell 
you the heavy duty spring/s and relief valve that most likely will 
overpressurize your cooler when the weather gets cold.  Since we know that 
the only real barrier to the cold artic weather out of Canada getting down to 
your area in Texas is a thin barbed wire fence at the US/Canada border you 
would be best to avoid the heavy oil pressure spring/s and relief valve.  If 
you do have a Bentley Official Manual for year engine you can check for 
proper spring lengths, and thusly sort through your collection of springs.
