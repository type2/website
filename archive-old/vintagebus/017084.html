I don't think SAE bolts have decimal points in their grading system. It's
just whole numbers, like grade 2, grade 5, or grade 8. Grade 5 bolts
have three lines on the head and grade 8 bolts have six.

Metric bolt grades do have decimal points: 8.8, 9.8, and 10.9 are common
on cars. Sounds like you need grade 10.9 metric bolts.

Trivia: &quot;The first number represents ~ 1/100 of the minimum tensile
strength in N/mm**2, while the second number is 10 times the ratio
of the minimum yield point (or 0.2% yield strength) to the minimum
tensile strength.&quot; (Bosch Automotive Handbook, 4th edition)

That's good info.  I'd like to throw in something about hard bolts if I could.
 I don't know what grade bolts came off of the RGB's - there are those with
much more knowledge of the specifics of busses out there and presently I don't
have access to my bus to check it out - but someone replacing those bolts
should go with the same exact hardness.  

The reason why is that in the case of bolt hardness (and a lot of other things
for that matter) more is not better.  To put in a bolt that is harder that
what came out of it invites big time trouble.  Yes, the bolts are harder, but
it is that very hardness that makes them a poor candidate for a use that has a
lot of viberation, particularly gear (high frequency) viberation.

The harder the bolt is, the more they can be damaged by cyclical viberation. 
They easily work harden and tend to break like glass after a while.

My dad is a retired mechanical engineer for a paper mill, and when he was
working there, he frequently consulted charts that gave him info on which
bolts to use for what environment that they would be used in.  Once he
specified bolts to hold down a 150 hp 440V 3-phase motor to turn a cooling fan
which necessitated him to specify a particular set of 8 bolts to hold down the
base.  Grade 8 is what he came up with.  The contractor read the plans, had
grade 10 bolts in his supply and said, &quot;well, if grade 8's are good, then
grade 10's are better!&quot;  All 8 bolts failed after 5 months of operation. 
Grade 8's were installed after the schrapnel (sp) was cleaned up and the motor
has been in service for 6 years now without any incident.

VW had probably done experiments with different grade bolts, or at the very
least consulted data to come up with that hardness.  I'd stick with the
hardness that they came up with.

I hope this helps!
