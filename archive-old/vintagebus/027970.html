&gt;Any recommendations on getting a Bendix Sapphire I radio repaired?
&gt;It was working great till about two weeks ago.

Call around to local TV and radio repair shops.  Explain what you
have and how old it is, and see if you can find someone willing
to look at it.  If you get no joy after asking lots of shops, and
you still want to go local, you *might* try contacting a local
amateur radio group - they might have someone that would be willing
to look at it on an informal basis.  You might also ask for leads
on the Usenet newsgroup sci.electronics.repair - again, explain
what you have and how old it is.

Good luck!

Matt Roberds
