Subject: Re: How do you put clips on 5 lug rims?
Message-ID: &lt;36F7FA7A.B40FB7EC_at_gte_dot_net&gt;

I put clips on the wheels on a Thing.  The secret is to use Steel pop rivets
and not aluminum ones.  You may need a larger pop rivet tool than are often
used on aluminum ones, but it works.  Get 3/8 inch rivets.  I used a Dremel
tool and cut off disk to make it flush after installation.

You have to bend the clips out to get them installed, but they are pretty good
steel and the ones I had bent back with no problem

&gt; I remember quite a while ago on either the vintagvw list or type2 list that
&gt; there was a discussion about putting new clips on old VW 5 lug rims.  I can
&gt; recall someone stating that a regular pop rivet gun would not do the trick -
&gt; that you had to have some special tool to do it correctly.  In a few days,
&gt; I'll be receiving a set of 5 lug rims which need the clips replaced and was
&gt; wondering if anyone could shed any light on what I'll need to do this
&gt; properly?  I'm going to sandblast the rims myself and prep them properly
&gt; this time so I don't have powdercoated sand like my last set.  Then it will
&gt; cost me a grand total of $100 to have all 5 rims done.
&gt;
&gt; BTW:  I'm posting this to the vintagvw and type2 lists since 5 luggers are
&gt; common to both dubbers.  Thanks for helping me get one step closer to
&gt; bringing my bus home!
