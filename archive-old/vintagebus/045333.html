&lt;&lt; I am in the process of removing a sapphire V from an early 67 to my late 
67.  Is there something I am missing on getting it out, seems like there are 
4 tabs holding it in, how do I remove the faceplate.
Hi Patrick,
Pull off knobs and collars.  Undo nuts around knobs shafts.  Find and unbolt 
from the body up under the dash the support on the forward end of radio.  
Drop radio down and disconnect antenna, power, and speaker wires.  The face 
plate and the backing/stiffing plate should should then easily pop apart from 
each other.

&lt;&lt; Also I noticed on the early 67 that the big black relay has a little 
doohicky mounted at the bottom and connected to the relay.  My bus doesn't 
have that, could that be my problem for always having the high beams on.&gt;&gt;
Could be!  Having any of the system missing is going to cause problems with 
something.

&lt;&lt;Also when using my turn signal to turn left the signal won't stay in the on 
position, is that something I can fix w/in the assemebly or should I remove 
the whole
 assembly and replace w/one that seems ok. I guess if I replace I will have 
to remember what wires go where. &gt;&gt;
Often this type of problem is caused due to having lubricant in one area that 
is not supposed to have it there.  This area requires a certain amount of 
friction to keep the switch locked in place!  If you do replace the switch 
the wires are colored coded which the wiring diagram helps one with the 
mapping of where everthing goes.

    One last question would it be easier for me to run wire through the 
steering column on my 67 to get  my horn setup or remove a column from 
another 67 bus that is all wired up and ready to go.&gt;&gt;
Just runa brown grounding wire up through the steering column.  The only way 
to trade steering columns is to replace the entire stering box!  Eric&amp;Barb
