Subject: Re: [VB] front tranny mount

well, i went and checked the mount again and tried pulling back on the
fanhousing like you said, but the engine/tranny didnt tip up at all.  i
tried tightening the bolts for the front mount, but they were already pretty
tight.  it usually only clunks when im shifting into a higher gear, not
really when im down shifting.  if im really cautious when shifting i can
make it so there is no clunk.  is there anything else it could be besides
the mounts?  the shift stick doesnt jump around and im not sure what you
mean by &quot;lurch&quot;.  thanks for all the replies ive received so far!

&gt; does the shift stick jump around?   does the bus lurch?   can you grab
hold
&gt; of the fan housing and pull back and have the front of the engine (and
&gt; tranny) tip up?  then sounds like a bad front mount.
&gt;
&gt; you need to pull the motor out to chane it, and pull the rear wheel, pull
the
&gt; RGBoxes, apull the tranny back a few inches (you can leave the brake hoses
&gt; connected) to get the old one out and get the new one in.   check the rear
&gt; mounts too, they may help replacement.
&gt;
&gt; if you want to reseal the nose cone at trans case pull the tranny all the
way
&gt; out, and do that.  the leak by the rear shift coupleing woiuld be the
hockey
&gt; stick seal in the nose cone, you you could replace it too.
&gt;
&gt; bad front mounts can cause problems including cracked nose cones
