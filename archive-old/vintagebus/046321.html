&lt;&lt; Hmmmm, why?   The  few bare rims I have with decent original paint, both

black, without immediately noticable overspray from the white side.    &gt;&gt;

Hi Clara,
Hmm, your question is a bit ambiguous so we will do our best to cover the 
bases.
1.  When you tell the powdercoater you want the rims to be two differant 
colors he will think that you want a crisp line where the differant colors 
meet.  This will require cooling time of the parts and taping of the other 
color area from over spray.  In otherwords more work and a pain for the 
powder coater.  Which is going to cost you more $$.

2.  Gene just Pmailed us with the results from talking to the powdercoater 
about our information.
  To zinc primer, semigloss black the tire area and inside, then white coat 
the outer part of the wheel.  Instead of just having him primer it and white 
coat the outside and then having the mess and time to paint the rest of the 
2/3s of the rim with normal black paint by hand at home.  Cost increase is 0 
for the former over the latter.

3.  Looking at original paint 15 inch rims we have there is no crisp line 
especially where the white paint blew through the slots in the rim.
