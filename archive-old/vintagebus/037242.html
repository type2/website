Hi Brian,
Having 120-130 compression might be too high considering that your rings and
cylinders do not seat completely until 3,000 or 6,000 miles.  It might be
best to take off the heads and measure things out now.  It would also be
interesting to know what the outside temps are out your way right now and
what RPMs you are running at the speeds you mentioned.  Unfortunitly the
Dansk heat exchangers are bad news.  When VW went from the stale air heating
system to the fresh air system in DEC 62, VW in essense took the round piping
of the stale air J-tube and cast a externally finned aluminuim heat sink
around it and added the fresh air heater sheet metal.  Eight and a half
months later (AUG 63 = the start of the 1964 model year.) VW made standard
for bus here in the US the upright 1500cc engine that had been sold as a
pancake engine in the type 3 since 1961.  This new engine came with heat
exchangers with 60mm wide heater exit tube openings to hook up to the now
also larger heater tubing of the VWs.  Previously in 1963 and earlier model
years this had been 50mm.  But the big hidden improvement was that now the
J-tube that was cast into the aluminuim heat sink was not round but finned
inside also!  This produced a larger surface area to scavange heat from the
exaust which meant more heat to the interior during the winter and during the
summer with the heat shut off and the cooling vent open the exaust gases were
cooled and this resulted in less backpressure against the heads due to that
fact that when gasses are cooled they take less space and thusly lesser head
temps.  In otherwords Dansk has installed late fresh air 1963 model year
J-tubes in 1964 model year heater sheet metal.  So this with 1200cc would be
adequate, but with 1300cc and larger engines they cause too much back
pressure and really heat up your heads.  We would also reccomend using the
doghouse cooling system.  Including the 33mm to 35mm wide cooling fan and 2:1
ratio lower crankshaft pulley.
