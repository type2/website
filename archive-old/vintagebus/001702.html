Just got a really nice deal on tail lens assemblies for '63-71 busses.  I'm
not sure where they're made but the housings look to be much nicer that the
Brazilian and Indian ones that have been on the market for the last few
years (and at a better price to boot).  $45 a pair ($24.95 for one) for
complete brand new housings with lenses, bulbholders, and all.  Lenses alone
are $5.95 each.  I didn't get too many (8 assemblies plus a dozen additional
lenses) so it's first come first served.  Best to call to order
(215-234-VWVW) due to the present high e-mail volume.  If you want to pay
over the phone have a personal check handy.  Must mention your List
membership to get these prices.

Thanks,
