 i also remembered the words of a
 &gt;mechanic from the shop i worked at, and a long-time philosophy of mine: vw
 &gt;spent countless dollars (d marks) engineering, designing, and deciding what
 &gt;things a user of one of their cars needed in order to be notified of any
 &gt;troubles and came up with this result--2 idiot lights.
 
 Or do you think VW spent VERY LITTLE on this and rather realized that their 
 engines were tough enough to deal with MOST situations and did not want to 
 spend money on accessories to tell you whats going on? THEY WANTED TO SAVE 
 MONEY. &gt;&gt;
============
I dont think VW spent any money on it at all.   That system was designed pre 
war when the car that later became vw was being designed, as a cheap 
affordable small car for the German public, not for the rich.  VW was not 
around then.  And at that time, any one who drove a car was expected to be at 
least semi mechanical.  The older instruction manuals show how to do al sorts 
of thing that modern ones don't, including change gear oil, adjust brakes, 
etc etc etc.  Guages were expensive.  the car was cheap.  Cable brakes.  Flat 
glass.   2 idiot lights.
