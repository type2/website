&lt;&lt;  Without looking at my notes (look ma!  no hands!) the earlier
redux housing require 2- #6306s and 2- #6305s. &gt;&gt;

That'll teach me to think!  The pre-63's actually take 3 #6306s
(VW #311-501-383) and 1 #6305 (VW #211-501-285).  Back during
the first part of December last year I could have sold them for
$30 and $18 respectively.

But don't take my word on this!   I've been wrong before!  ;)
