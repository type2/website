&lt;&lt; In preparation for this bigass job I'm gathering parts now.  The questions
are:
         Once I get them out, how do I measure my current axles at the paddle
end to determine their worthiness?&gt;&gt;
With a feeler gauge set.  See your VW bus workshop manual section H-5, page
3.

&lt;&lt; If I need replacements where do I get them?&gt;&gt;
So far as we know both the upper and lower axles are a used only item.  so
wrecking yards, swap meets or used parts dealers.  Also check your VW
workshop manual about having your old upper axles paddle areas redone to new
condition by having a chrome shop do some work on just the inside ends.  If
any one knows of supplies of new lower and upper axles we would love to hear
of them!

&lt;&lt;Does anyone know whether these axles are the same length and design as mine
in the '66?&gt;&gt;
Yes from JUNE 1959 chassi # 469 506 to AUG 1967 the upper axles are
interchangeable.  Eric&amp;Barb
