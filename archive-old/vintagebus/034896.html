Hi Bob,
If it is too skwooshy you just need to get tires with a higher load rating.  
What is the maximum load rating of what you are using now?  For 1963 on up 
buses with the wider and higer lipped rear wheel wells you can install 
235/75R15s (29&quot; dia.) on the rear.  We have used these with no noticeable 
skwooshyness from them.  This size tire increases the speed about 7 MPH over 
what you would get with 165s with the stock early 1960s tranny.  With the 
freeway flier tranny this same change in rear tires diameter results in about 
a 14 MPH increase.    Eric&amp;Barb
