&gt; Also, I was thinking about hanging the filter mount from the support

&gt; further thinking, this sounds like a horrible idea.  If the hoses run UP
&gt; to the filter,  wouldn't all the oil run out of the lines everytime you
&gt; turn off your engine?  If so, obviously I need to hang the filter from
&gt; under the bus somewhere so the filter mount is no higher than the oil
&gt; pump.  Does this sound right?

My O-Berg full flow is hanging under the left corner where the left side
battery would go if there was one. Whem you look into my engine room to
the left corner, you see two studs coming thru from underneath and two
13mm nuts and lockwashers on the studs. the studs are attached to the
filter. All the hosing is under the car.
