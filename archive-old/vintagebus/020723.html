Subject: Re: [VB] middle seat question / trade / parts needed to repro

Yes, they offered full length middle seats with walk thru's.  Being &quot;walk
through&quot; is commonly confused between the 2 place front seating
arrangement and cargo doors on both sides, I can answer affirmatively to
both.  The double door idea is much rarer, but my '61 DeLuxe 15 window
has the full length middle seat with &quot;buckets&quot; in front.  This was a
standard arrangement, and the vehicle code only came with a sunroof.  If
you didn't want one, (like the original owner of my '61) you had to
special order without (M-code).
