My 57 with a full length seat takes four.
My 60 with a 2/3 seat took four.
I know the late model floor mats have multiple holes in them....but never 
really pair attention to hom many brackets they used.
Most likely one per hole in floor mat.

&gt; ps, a lot of conversation on clamps, but still no answer on how many of what

The 2/3 seats I've seen take 6, two per leg loop.  If you seat has holes
to accept them, use the clamps with nipples, otherwise use the ones
without.
