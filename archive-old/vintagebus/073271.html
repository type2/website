Subject: Re: [VB] SW gas heater question.....

There is no phone there, or time he's opened or closed. Just a cell number I didn't get. It's a crap shoot to find him there and we were just lucky that he was (we waited about 45 minutes for him to show up.  If you ever go there see if the cats have been fed, if not you will kno he'll show up

ps. and yes I will pick some up if anybody wants one
but he's not cheap, 20 k for a BD deluxe (no#975) and 10 k for a 54 rag beetle, 20 k for a split bug, 4 k for an all original 60 SC and I was scared to ask prices on his other stuff, nice 60 DD panel there also

Maybe its just me, but what good does that do anybody looking for heater
parts? Unless there is a phone # or address that goes along with it I
don't want to know. Are you offering to pick up the parts or did you
just forget to type the phone #/address ;-) Good thing I don't need SW
parts.
