Subject: Doghouse cooler dissect

  Well I went and did it, I cut a type 1 doghouse oil cooler open to see
what makes it work and this is what I found.

5 rows on the inlet side, 5 rows on the exit side.
Each row has 10 passages
At the top it is basically open , so a plugged row or 2 would not restrict
oil flow, there is nothing directing oil to any specific area of the cooler,
when it reaches the top,  just kind of mixes and is forced down the exit
side.

The reason I'm posting this is that the cooler I opened looked beautiful
from the outside, but after opening it up I noticed a few of the passages
plugged on the exit side of the cooler, but none on the inlet side, just
goes to show that even though you think you have the cooler cleaned it still
can have blocked passages.

Next I will cut open a Type 4 cooler and then maybe a Type 3 and will post
what I find inside.
