Subject: Re: [VB] Lifespan of a full flowed type 1 in a bus

&gt;&gt;So I wonder : How many miles did you get out of your full  flowed type 1 
engine in a bus ?

(I know a listmember who got 0 miles on  the 1776 )

I still don't know why my supposedly 26mm oil  pump is  21mm deep and 38 mm
diameter. &lt;&lt;
Hi Arnaud,
60,000+ miles each on two engines so far with the full flow oil  
filter/pumps.  With 10s of thousands more miles on several more  engines.
  No hoses to go bad!  The only problem we had with some of these  that has 
the filter on the left side of the engine, was that the old  style stock 
muffler did not fit on.  Cut the neck, angle down and  forward slightly, and weld 
aluminum back together to clear the left heat  riser tube in the stock mufflers. 
 Then redrill the oil passages through  the welded area.
  Have heard of, but not seen so far, a newer made stock muffler  which has 
this heat riser tube comes out the right forward side of the muffler  so the 
left filter problem is solved that away.
  As for your oil pump size problem, sounds like someone sold you a 38  mm 
diameter geared pump as a 26 mm one!
