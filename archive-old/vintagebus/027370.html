Hey folks,

Anyone going to KP have a 62 &amp; earlier hump back bench seat they would like to sell.  I'll be looking for one (and its 3 position mounting brackets) for my 62 DC while I'm up there.  The PO changed to the later 1/3rd 2/3rd split bench at some point.  I'd like to go back to the original.

I'm also on the look out for a good slash rear (for the 65 pop top Westy) bumper, '62 air cleaner, original safari dash tabs and wing bolts, and a few other things.  P-mail me if you have any leads.  Thanks You!!


Steve
