Subject: RE: [VB] pimpride steering wheels

Chris Dreike, listee and Steering Wheel Man takes OG wheels, removes all the 
molded material and pours new material around the metal armature and into a 
mold taken from an NOS wheel. I have two and they're great. Not sure if he's 
still producing, but save those &quot;hopeless&quot;, beat up old wheels for him. Patched 
wheels are OK, but Chris' have all the nubs and are as solid as OG. 

 -Harry in Fresno

&gt; The flat four wheels are not exact copies either. There used to be a guy 
named 
&gt; Chris from SoCal that was making brand new ones that were rumoured to be real 
&gt; nice and cheapre than Kochs.
