Subject: eddie and flip seats

Since when did this &quot;technical forum&quot; turn into a people bashing forum?
A few months ago I don't think this would have flewn on this list....
Is all this talk helping anyone with their bus?  Its monday
here....dunno about out west though.

Flame me off list...just thought it needed to be said..._dot_despite the
fact the list administrator even hopped on the topic....


Does anyone have any information on what was available for the flip seat
westies?  as far as interior options go....

Thanks,
Isaiah
