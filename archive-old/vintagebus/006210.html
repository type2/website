&gt;So how common are Double Door Kombi's? Got any info on 'em?
&gt;
Less common than other models, I have seen &lt; 5 in my limited travels.  There
is 1 in Phoenix, needs some welding, previously from the LA area.  I know
the owner but have not seen it yet.  Production counts are unclear as it was
just an option.

There is a real nice Dove Blue one in the L.A. area.

There's a fake '55 for sale in OR right now for $1500...

You're in Texas right?  There was a '61 DD Kombi for sale a couple years ago
in Fort Worth, TX, I am not sure what became of it.
