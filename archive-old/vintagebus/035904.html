No quarter
ah did you paint said part?
If not check for distinguishing scrapes, paint, lack there of, rust or lack 
there of on the mating surfaces these tell the tail of the use/abuse of your 
bus and how it wants to go back together.
I Can usually Zen these problems out;
that's the benefit of having a beater bus that is not all powder coated etc. 
be the bus
If I'm no help, sorry for the wasted bandwith
