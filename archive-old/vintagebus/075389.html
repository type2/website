Subject: Re: [VB] quick bus update

 Josh,

Get your door bottoms welded up rather than putting other doors in. There
used to be pieces available that replaced the bottoms of the doors, that
you would weld on, and paint over. Get to know a decent small local body
shop that is friendly towards your bus, and who will do small jobs for
you. Or, learn how to weld, and rent the tools and go for it.

Throwing out a pair of doors just because they have some rust holes, is
not going to help anyone who owns a bus. Or ask the list for doors, and
offer to send your old ones to someone on the list. We don't have parts to
throw away anymore.

Regarding the speedo, keep a bus log, and use the existing miles when you
do work or install a new engine. Subtraction is an easy and useful skill.

&gt; hi all, just got through putting the lower dash thingie in, that was very
&gt; tiring. then i found out that it has to be off in order for me to put the
&gt; ignition switch back in!! man am i mad! oh well it will give me more
&gt; experience with vw's.
&gt; then i lookd at my cargo doors, and the bottom of them has rust holes. now i
&gt; have to try to find those. hopefully someone in my vw club will have a pair
&gt; that they can spair. also how can i turn the miles down on the speedometer?
&gt; i dont want the origional twenty thousand some odd miles to be shown on the
&gt; new engine whenever it is that i get one. thanks in advance,
