Wll the trip was uneventful for me since it is only like 50 miles round
trip. Very close to my daily commute.
Met a couple of ours. Mark Pribanic and Jerry Dasson both driving lil'
porsches with busses at home. I will say that Jerrys vert is one great
looking car. I think that Bob Whitby and clan were going to be there but
missed them somehow,
There were a lot of cars but not a lot of busses.
Don from manasses with the puck was there at the swap (oops missed him
heh) that guy is everywhere.
The bus I fancied the most was a 66 RHD High-Roof panel, so cool.
A few trick custom busses (im not much for those),  a nice SC, a couple
nice splitty campers, a sub-hatch 60 .. interesting.
bout it...
cheers
