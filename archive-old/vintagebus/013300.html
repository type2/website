As I have received many questions re:my interior, I thought I would post all I
know right now:

The bus interior I think is for a 72 model, I am not sure. It is the style
where the icebox is not next to the cargo doors. The people I got it from,
told me they thought it was a much better setup, as it made the interior a lot
more open.

I am not sure who made it. I think it is from a westfalia. 

I am located in Somerville, MA. Right ouside of Boston. I can not ship this.
