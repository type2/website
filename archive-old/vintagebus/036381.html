I just ordered 1 kulvw for my 66 single cab. I don't have many choices
here in Illinois because on a truck it has to be six digits long and
has to start with at least one number.

P.S. I have a front beam out to the drums, a whole transaxle assembly
all the way out to the drums, and almost all of the front nose of 61
single cab I got this all from for sale. The nose has all of the
windsheild frame all the way down to the the bottom edge just before
where the metal lip folds over to form a seal just behing the bumper.
The metal lip itself is missing though. I live in Kincaid,IL and if
anyone is interested they can e-mail me.

&gt; I had &quot;15VIEWS&quot; on my 15 window, and 1LOW62 on my 62 kombi that I
crashed.
&gt; I haven't come up with a good one for my panel yet (but it won't be
on the
&gt; road for another 3 or 4 years anyway).
