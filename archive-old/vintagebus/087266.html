Subject: re: vw boat

I use to have a vw boat as well, I had it stolen off an old bus back in 1994
on a trip down to LA from Tacoma, WA. It was one of the original ones and not
one of the ones someone here in the Seattle area made about the same time. I
saw another original one on the samba about 5 years ago for sale he was asking
1k, it was somewhere out of AZ, it sat on the list for months. I was finally
ready to buy it and the seller had just made a deal to sell it with one of his
buses he was also trying to sell.
The original boats were considerably lighter than the repro boats. The repro
boats were a hard sell back then as they were almost to heavy for two people
to load. This is defiantly something to consider when perusing your project

As a starting point contact Ken at The Bus Co. He remembers who made the repro
run back in the day and may even know if the mold still exists. Kens site is

Good luck and let us know if it works out.
