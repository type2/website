Subject: [VB] Engine Problems..Help?

&gt;Hey Folks, While driving home from my first show with my new bus, the engine
&gt;siezed (its a 1500).... After towing it home, I was able to free it up. It
&gt;seemed to turn over with no problems, so I decided to start it. I ran for a
&gt;few minutes, with no smoke or noise, but &quot;seized&quot; up again. One more time,
&gt;then it started to knock..

Michael-
A main bearing can spin when the dowel fails, seize the engine,
and spin free when cool allowing the restart. However, the
second restart will mean no oil to the rods, hence the knock.
With the cylinders off, push / pull the rods to find a loose one,
remove it to satisfy your curiosity, then split the case  to get
the mains. Either way, &quot; seized&quot; is bearings.
Dave
