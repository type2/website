My horn works doesn't everyone's?lol  My turn signals work
also, had trouble when I first got it though.  The turn
signal switch wouldn't go up to, activate the right turn
signal.  When I asked the PO about it, he said he just
turned on the emergency flashers, if some one was coming up
on him to fast.  Which happens a lot here in Phoenix.  See,
the average speed is 15-20 miles over posted limit. no
jioke.  I love pissing other drivers off by driving the
limit.  Well what I believe to be the limit since the speedo
don't work, sprung spring.
