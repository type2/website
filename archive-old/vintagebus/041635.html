Pretty common, unfortunately.  Another buyer appears and the seller
casually mentions that he already has an offer for $xxx.  The buyer
naturally offers $50 more and has cash in hand.

From the seller's point of view, cash in hand is better than a promise
over the phone.  Having been stood up by more people than I care to think
of, I can understand the seller's point of view.  

When I make a deal of
this sort, I tell the phone buyer that &quot;first cash buys&quot;, which means that
I am still free to sell to that Japanese gentleman that walks in off of
the street.  This also motivates the phone buyer to get the cash to me
toot-sweet if he is truly interested.  I don't fiddle around with deposits
either.  The simpler and quicker the transactions, the happier both
parties will be.

If I'm the buyer, It behooves me to get the cash to the seller ASAP.  This
eliminates some long-distance deals, but it also eliminates 
disappointment.  This hobby is supposed to be fun, not stressful.
