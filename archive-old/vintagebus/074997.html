Subject: RE: [VB] My buses are going up for sale

  I guess I'm also lucky. My wife used to get pissed when I bring another
bus home. I have been limited to 6 at home, so I do have the rest stored in
various locations and only bring another home when 1 leaves. She did get
excited when I started selling off a few from the house and was down to 3
there, which quickly grew back to 6, oops one more then I had before. 
  She will not ride in any of my buses, she does work at the shop so gets
her fill of VW's by the end of each day.
  She did let me build a new garage and has said OK to phase 2 of the
garages (a big one)
  One day I will get the flip seat restored (she likes that one) and am sure
she will ride in it. But riding 100's of miles I DOUBT IT

&gt;.... Many out there profess to have an understanding SO but in reality

&gt; is a limit to the amount of VWness the SO can stand. I've been on this
&gt; list long enough (5+ years) to have seen many a bus person dispose of
&gt; busses unwontedly and even relationships dissolve over the ownership of
&gt; said.  Lets face it MOST SO's hate these things.
&gt; 
&gt; So, do you married people have a limit to owning busses, going to shows,
&gt; swaps, et. al??  Be honest.

My SO of almost 25 years has humored me w/ the bus stuff the last 5 years or
so, but I have noticed that every time I bring another one home, she has
showed up at the same time w/ either a couple of dogs rescued from the
shelter or a new house we need to rescue, etc. Therefore I am at my present
limit w/ 3, although when she does look at new houses, she is always looking
for a place w/ lots of garage/shop space, places to store buses!  Not sure
what this means.

She has never gone to a show w/ moi yet, but loves to camp in the westy,
etc.  Her reply is &quot;Tell me what's fun about  driving 1500 miles +- in 5
days to a show, stand in a parking lot talking about buses, drinking beer, &amp;
not having a shower the whole time&quot; - well excuse moi.

This weekend tho I believe we had a breakthru, when she asked what she could
do to help w/ the new wiring harness in the DC-She got stoked when we went
over to a friend's shop where he builds high performance motors, carbs, etc.
&amp; watched him get a motor that had been sitting in a barn for 20-30 years,
running in no time! She thought that looked pretty easy! Knowing her, I bet
she could do it, while not wasting a lot of time trying to figure out the
best layout for the garage, where my 13 mm wrench is, making dinner for 8,
working 2 jobs, nurturing the kids, her girl friends,  &amp; a bunch of old
folks, etc.

Praise Allah or whomever that gives us SO's who will let us indulge in our
little fetish as much as they do.
