Subject: The Silk Thread Trick
Message-ID: &lt;47bc3d56.244d2609_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

To All:

This is another case where I assumed everyone was familiar with an assembly
technique common to horizontally-opposed air-cooled engines. The mating
flange of such engines is typical wider than those found on the VW.  On the
other hand, it was a common procedure on Corvair engines, although not done
at the factory.

This procedure isn't new.  I learned it as a boy and it was old even then.
The VW crankcase usually forms a leak-free fit without it, unless the mating
surfaces have been damaged, in which case the use of a silk thread provides a
bit of added insurance.  Conversely, don't expect a bit of thread to replace
proper fitting and torquing-up.

Despite what you've heard (and seen :-)  VW engines don't have to dribble --
they can be as dry as their water-cooled cousins.

A number of people asked...

&lt;&lt; ,
 	I'd like to know what the silk thread trick is.
  &gt;&gt;

To which I replied....

Aircraft engines tyically use aluminum castings for the crankcase, gear
housings and accessory case.  Rather than use a gasket, the surfaces are
machined dead flat and coated with a non-hardening sealant, usually
'Permatex' (or whatever is spec'd by the manufacturer).  The coating of
sealant is very thin.  It is allowed to dry then one or two silk threads are
aligned and pressed into the sealant.  If one, it is located centrally on the
sealing surface.  If two threads are spec'd they are kept around 1/4&quot; apart.

I've never seen this spec'd for MAGNESIUM castings, although I know some
mechanics do it.  Personally, I've never had a drippy VW crankcase using just
the sealant.

Some VW mechanics use the thread trick on every case.  I use it only on
aluminum cases... but I've used this trick once or twice when the parting
surface of the crankcase halves was pitted with corrosions... after filling
the pits with metal-filled epoxy and filing them flat.

The Type IV crankcase is an aluminum casting, hence my use of thread.

Frankly, it probably wouldn't hurt to leave it out... except I wasn't the
mechanic-in-charge of that particular engine... so I showed him all the
tricks I could think of to insure his first VW rebuilding experience would be
successful.  (The engine leaked like hell -- one of the valve gallery rails
was scored.  Filing out the scratch cured the leak.  No leaks from the
crankcase or push-rod tubes.)

Don't use cotton or synthetics.  The thread should be pure silk.  If you
can't find what you need at a yardage-goods store, try a sporting-goods shop
that caters to fishermen who tie  their own flies or dress their own rods.
Some archery and hobby supply stores carry silk thread, used for fletching
(archery) and rigging (model ships).  DON'T use suture material, it's far too
thick.

Be sure the sealant is dry before applying the thread.  If the sealant can
transfer to your fingers, it will, leaving you with one hell of a mess.

Try to find some books on the overhaul of horizontally opposed aircraft
engines.  The procedure is bound to be illustrated in such manuals.
