Subject: VW sealing componds

1.  sealing of window glasses        Glazing cement D 10  
                                                      &quot;          &quot;
D10.5

2.  Weather resistent sealing of joints between wood, steel and plastic
parts, e.g. slats on a pick-up
                                                  Sealing compound  D 14
 Just goes to show that VW did put a sealer between the wood slats and the
BED, &quot;David&quot; (oh ya you still need the screws) 

Now if someone could just decipher what the D means we would all know what
to use. They also list adhisvices for attaching sound deadner, etc.

These codes were taken directly for the OG parts manual.
