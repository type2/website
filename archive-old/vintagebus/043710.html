&gt;how to clean really grimy glass....bob hoover recommended something like bon
&gt;ami-one of those powder cleansers like ajax or comet, but ithink he said you
&gt;had to use bon amu as the otheres were too abrasive...

Bon Ami was also specifically recommended on a F_at_rd hi-po list I used to 
hang out on; lots of guys with early Mustangs etc with dirty windows.  The
word there was that there are two different kinds of Bon Ami; one in a
silver canister and another in a gold canister -- one safe for glass and
one not -- it was supposed to be clearly marked on the label.  They
suggested trying hardware stores if you can't find the &quot;for glass&quot; kind
at the supermarket.
