Subject: Re: [VB] Eating clutch cables...help ?

I'm sure somebody has the list still that gives the necessary items to carry
with you EVERYWHERE you go in a VW.  Some of the stuff goes for whether it
is a 50 or a 91!  If somebody has that list handy, maybe a quick post is in
order.  When I first turned 16 and my 67 21-window died (or broke
something), parts were fairly easy to come by and only a short skateboard
away.  Now, nobody around stocks anything and you have to wait hours or days
to get them.

Even with my old, ridiculously low 67, I could do a clutch cable in about 15
minutes!  Damn those old Kennedy 2300 lb pressure plates!!

&gt; My '71 westy has been through three clutch cables in less than a year.
&gt;
&gt; Any advice appreciated, as I don't want to keep carrying around multiple
&gt; spare cables : )
