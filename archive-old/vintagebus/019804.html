hi all-

a feww basic troublshooting questions

i have more or less a stcok 65' bus that has an
aftermarket &quot;gear shift lock&quot; (one from bob scott _at_
vintageparts), anyhoo now the question..

recently i have been getting a nice grind if i try and
shift into reverse (obviously i am stopped when doing
this). the problem is worse if i shift into reverse
slowly, if i shift quickly i can ususally get by it
but if i do it slowly it can be a real pain to get
into gear

secondly now the lower gears (1st 2nd) also seem to be
very difficult to get into gear. without nashing of
teeth, increasing my kids vocabulary to some things
they really don't need to know etc.

So- where to begin? the clutch appears adjusted
correctly, with minimum of play. The problem *appears*
to be at the front end of the bus as opposed to back
inthe tranny. Is that shift lock thingie causing
problems? Where would some likey places be to look. Oh
yah as far as i know the clutch plate is fine too.

Thanks!

Michael
