&gt;I have front step ups on my 65. I was told by the PO that they were
original.  The rubber on them is pretty worn.  I called Wolfsberg West
looking for new covers, they told me that those were add-ons, but that they
were not a standard size, and therefore could not sell me new covers.  The
salesman reccommended basically cutting the step down, until it was small
enough to be covered by the gas pedal covers.


Owwwww! Don't do that. Take the old one or a cardboard pattern into the Auto
Zone, Checker, Pep Boys, whatever. Find a nice brake bedal cover off a
Toyota or something that will fit it. They got all kinds of generic pedal
covers for cheap. The one that fit mine was a trapezoid brake pedal cover
about 5 inches by 3 inches. Looks dandy and if I ever find an NOS one at the
swaps (yea, right) I can still fit it. Or you could get one of those racy
anodized aluminum ones and rivet it on. Prolly make the bus go faster.
