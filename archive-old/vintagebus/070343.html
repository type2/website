&gt;If the clutch pedal bushings are getting worn the bolt at the elbow of 
&gt;the pedal can hit the front bumper bracket. That will cause a scraping 
&gt;sound and it will also be intermittent, depending on whether on not you 
&gt;appy a little sideways force as you push the pedal.

Thanks - I'll check there, too.  I pulled the tab off (what the clevis pin at front of clutch cable goes through) to repair it and the bushings seemed fine - 
snug, slick, etc.  But I'll recheck that nut and the whole front pedal / linkage.

It's more feel than sound - the noise I mentioned is definitely either the throwout bearing or the gland nut - I can hear it coming from astern.  I don't 
notice a noise directly connected with this rubbing sensation when the pedal is depressed.
