Subject: Re: [VB] The question of quality.  Was: Rubber seal too long

I sold my NOS windshield seal(real cheaply - practically a donation) to
Ronnie two years ago for that purpose, and they are finally coming in for
all of us. I heartily recommend everyone to do this. If his results are
way better than WCM, etc, which I've found really wanting, we'll all
benefit.

&gt; Now all we need to do is have people donate OG NOS seals of different
&gt; types, and maybe Ronnie will put them in the pipeline.  I've offered up
&gt; my one and only NOS safari window seal so maybe those will be along
&gt; someday.  I'll let Ronnie respond since I don't want to speak for him.
