&gt; &quot;... we continually heard and still hear from many people we talk to today
&gt; that want a 5 speed today, is that they are doing it to get an &quot;overdrive&quot;.
&gt; The problem is that &quot;all&quot; VW's ever made already have an overdrive in 4th
&gt; gear.

While what Mr. Berg said here is true, there is a hidden fact that he
doesn't mention.  While VW 4th gear ratios are overdrive (less than
1.0:1), VW axle ratios are quite high numerically.  Some bus axle ratios
are over 5:1 where a 4:1 is considered _really_ high for a
&quot;conventional&quot; vehicle.  The effect of the high axle ratio is to negate
the top gear &quot;overdrive&quot; to some extent.
