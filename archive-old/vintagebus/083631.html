For the  two-speed, self-parking wiper motor, what is the mechanism that
causes the  motor to self park?   My 67 just failed state inspection
because  the motor parks the wiper in the middle of the windshield.   This
hadn't been a problem to me, because I had found that if I turn off  the
switch at just the right time, the wiper will park to the side, but  the
state inspector didn't know the trick, so my bus has a nice black  reject
sticker until I can fix it.

Just in time for a weekend  project 8^)

Thanks for suggestions,

Beneath where the wires go into the wiper motor there are some  electrical 
contacts which are made and broken as the wiper motor arm  rotates.     WIPER  
MOTOR  53 Wiper motor, input  (+)  53a Wiper (+),  self-parking switch-off  53b 
Wiper (shunt  winding)    31b Return line to  negative battery terminal or 
ground, via switch or relay 
(switched  negative)
make sure the wires are correct  and you have power at the three number 53 
terminals. I think 53a is the one  which might have failed. The 31b doesnt 
connect to earth as I found out after  blowing several fuses. I hope this helps.
