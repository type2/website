Subject: Re: [VB] Questions.

&gt; I've got a couple questions.  First, how do I know if my wheel cylinders are
&gt; bad or not?  I'm having to replace my master cylinder, and am not sure
&gt; whether to replace the wheel cylinders while I'm at it or not.  Second, the
&gt; hinge pin on my gas pedal keeps coming out of the hinge, how is the pin
&gt; supposed to be secured in?  Thanks.

They are probably ok if they arent leaking but if you have the cash
available you can replace pretty much everything
-all wheel cyls
-shoes
-flexible hoses
for like 175.00 from busdepot if you get the cheaper front wheel
cylinders.

Would be money well spent.
