I have a 1959 doublecab, that i want to put seatbelts in.  Has anyone put 
belts in their doublecab or have a doublecab the came with seatbelts from 
Volkswagen?  I would some pictures if you could get me some.  I am trying to be as 
original as possible.
I put seat belts in the front of my 61 bus... drilled holes through for 
mounting, took a foot long piece of broken torsion leaf and drilled a hole in it, 
and bolted the belt through the bus and through the bar underneath to spread 
out the pull in case of emergency, so the bolt wouldn't pull out.  

the buses with stock seat belt mounts have nice reinforcemnts under the 
bus...I think 65-67 came with seatbelt mounts up front standard equipment
