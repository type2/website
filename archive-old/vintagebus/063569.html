Subject: scary story. advice needed.

So I take off for my buddy's place in the trusty '59 panel. 
I drive about 10 miles and all of the sudden... clank, clank from the rear. I 
fear the worst and take a quick turn into a parking lot. All of the sudden, I 
lose my hubcap and four lugbolts with it (they pushed the hubcap off). 
Whoa!!!! Scary stuff. Anyway, I jack the bus up, torque all of the lugnuts 
and am on my merry way back home. Everything is back together, but could I've 
damaged the wheel or anything else w/ just 1 lug bolt left? I didn't drive 
far at all, but I'm scared of my '59 panel now. 4 years of happy vw'ing and 
nothing like this! It could've ended VERY bad. What advice would you give me 
on what to do? I hope I can regain my bus confidence soon.
Thanks for all advice.
Best,
Pete
