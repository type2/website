So... Planning to do a valve job due to low compression in cylinder #3, so I
finally pulled everything apart today.  BTW, this is a 1500, pretty much stock
engine.

All the valves look about the same to me, should I be able to tell which one
was sticking?  Also the idiot book says to push on them (valves), but the big
springs holding them are too hard for that, am I supposed to take the springs
off and if so, how?

Looking at the pistons, they all have quite a bit of carbon on them, with #3
having the most, almost covering the whole thing.  I also notice that #3 has
a small chip out of the edge of it, about 1 mm thick and 5mm long, corresponding
to a bump on the edge of the cylinder.  Should I worry about this?  I havent
pulled off the cylinders yet, am not sure whether to take the heads to a machine
shop today or???

This is all being done in anticipation of a trip to New Orleans in April so
I want it to be done properly.  If I replace the chipped piston &amp; cylinder,
do I replace all of them???

Thanks in Advance,
Diana
