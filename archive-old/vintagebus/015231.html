To paraphrase John &quot;flamebait&quot; Howard's suggestion
that all Safari windows leak. The division between
those who own Safaris is between the owners who admit
that they leak and those who won't admit that they
leak.
I agree if my reading of his message is correct.

I will add a third category as those buses which are
stored and driven in Phoenix, AZ. It hasn't rained
here at ALL since around September! Other than that,
yeah they leak... I'd personally be happy to take 30%
of Seattle's rain and give them %30 of our sunshine.
During the restoration/redo/whatever of the '67 Westy
we installed OEM safaris with NOS German seals with
original latches etc etc ad nauseum and~ they leak.
Repop seals and repop windows will leak. Carry a towel
to mop up the dash and pkg tray before you make that
first right hand turn to avoid wearing all of the
accumulated overnights rain. Whoosh! Wakes you up like
a cold shower. Doh!
