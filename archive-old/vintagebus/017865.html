See if you can find a paint shop that will do the work with your
materials, essentially paying them to simply spray your paint.  There 
are places here in Sacramento that do that; I know that doesn't help you, 
but it does show that they exist...

&gt; Anyone near Milwaukee know where I could go to spray my bus.  I'm
&gt; desperate!  U-Spray doesn't rent out spray booths anymore.  I've go my
&gt; own HVLP and some good paint, but my garage is way too tight to do the
&gt; topcoat.  Need to make it one color before I move in a couple weeks.
