Subject: RE: [VB] Bus F S/ peoples attitudes

On the buyer side:
I would recommend running away from any seller who won't do anything reas=
onable
like take more photos or let a local person come see it.  More than likel=
y,
it's not a Bus you would want.  If enough people do this, either the pric=
e
will drop to what it is really worth or they will get with the program.

There are a couple VWs I tried to buy where the seller wouldn't sell me
more photos or wouldn't respond to emails.  I simply said &quot;Please email
me when detailed photos are available.&quot;  In every instance so far where
I saw the vehicle or spoke to the new buyer, the vehicles were not in the=

advertised condition.

On the seller side:
If a buyer annoys you, just say &quot;I'm not interested in selling to you&quot;.
 If your Bus is priced right, you don't have to deal with the losers.  I
would respond to all emails, that is common courtesy.
