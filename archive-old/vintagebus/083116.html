&gt; Now down to the important stuff. Where is the best place to hang a cup
&gt; holder in the cab? My guess is that under the wing window works pretty
well.
&gt; What is best? A solid holder or one of those fancy swinging gimballed
units?
&gt; Let me know where you put your's.

I saw someone hoseclamp a bicycle watter bottle holder  to the steering
column for a drink holder once. Owner said it worked great. I never got
around to doing it to mine though. Looked clean and simple too.
