Well, you don't have to modify the tank, just the hold down straps...
The benefit is having 5 extra gallons of gas, which means on road trips 
you have 150% the range of the splitty tank.  The senders for the 68-73 
tanks work fine with the splitty gauges and 68-73 tanks are much easier 
to find than 62-67 tanks.
