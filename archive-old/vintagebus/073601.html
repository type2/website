Subject: re: show single cab...

West Coast Classics would be a good place to start and would probably
get you the best condition vehicle you could find, but if you wanted to
save some money and do some legwork you can check out thesamba_dot_com and
other similar websites and scour the classifieds sections. The other
thing you should do is define show quality. There is a huge difference
in price and quality of a really nice driver that you would not be
embarrased to show or a full on show vehicle that is capable of winning
awards at big name shows. If you really want to win shows, it is
difficult to keep it clean enough while using it on the street as a
daily driver. A few sunny weedend drives is no big deal but to really
use it is hard. I tried to do that with a restored VW Thing I had and I
didn't really like competitive showing. It takes way too much cleaning
for me and it is hard to get all of the sand out of it from using it for
windsurfing. I bet you can find a really nice Single Cab for
$9000-$10,000, that would be something that you would not feel bad
parking in a line up at the Classic. It would probably run you
$15,000-$20,000 or more for something to win the Classic. You could do
it for less by doing alot of work yourself but that does not sound like
what you are after. I hope this helps and good luck. Please let us know
what you find out there.
