I have one of the &quot;L&quot; shaped 17 mm allens also, and it is indeed a tight
fit on the fill hole of a center section of a split screen bus because
of the proximity of the frame member. But it works great on the redux
box plugs and the drain plug, and is easier on a later bus or any bug. I
ended up spending $12 for a snap-on 3/8 drive 17mm allen socket. A guy I
used to work with cuts up the &quot;L&quot; shaped ones and welds them to a 3/8 in
socket, which is also a good trick...

  &gt; Anyway I went down to Sears and spent $8.95 for a 17mm
&gt; allen wrench.  The problem I had was that I  _could_not_  get an angle to
&gt; get
&gt; it open; I fought with it for a couple of hours before I finally gave up in
&gt; disgust.  I went over to a FLAP (Import Auto in Lakeland, FL is great; end
&gt; shameless plug for Keith and Mickey) and they had a special tool from EMPI
&gt; that had a 17mm allen wrench head on a 3/8 inch socket.  I was able to get
&gt; it open in about 5 minutes.  The EMPI transaxle tool cost me $3.25, and
&gt; worth every penny!!
