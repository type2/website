In '92, my company in Texas sold out to a company in California. My wife
and
my two kids and I decided that to make the trip, I'd ship my Acura Legend
and
drive my '65 Deluxe.  But before we went to CA, we need to go to Alabama
to leave some things we couldn't take into the Golden State at that time. 
So,
our trip was from Austin to 70 miles west of Atlanta back to Austin, and
then
on to Sacramento.

The trip to Anniston, just outside of Atlanta was done in about 12 hours, a
little
over 800 miles.  My wife and I swapped of driving and sleeping in the
floor. 
Came off with out a problem.  Trip back 12 hours later, same deal, no
sweat.

I had about 36 hrs in Austin to get sleep, adjust the valves, change plugs,
and
pack up a 2700 sq. ft house of furniture.

We left Austin about 12 noon on December 1, '92.  It was cold and raining
and I had Pat Metheny playing on the CD player as I pulled onto hiway 71
headed to Odessa.  I had just put in a pair of Kadrons and a new Freeway
Flyer.  We were about 100 miles out of Austin when the bus just
decelerated.
I looked at my wife, her eyes were big as saucers.  No sweat, just the
linkage
to carbs had slipped off.  Back on the road in 3 minutes.  Spent a good
night
in Odessa hotel, waiting for the next morning.

I hadn't got to change the oil in Austin so the next morning I stopped in
Artisian, NM at a
quick lube.  While I was there, a storm blew in over the mountains from
Carlsbad.
We headed straight into it, about a 40 MPH head wind.  Over Cloudcroft,
13000 ft.
in a snow storm. Not a problem, little slow but not a problem.  Even with
the Kadrons
I couldn't keep enough speed to overcome the wind.  Going down into
Alamagordo
was just a little shaky due to about a foot of snow on the road, but I made
it. Stopped
in Las Cruces for the night.

Next morning we headed west on I-10, crusing at about 70.  Seemed like we 
just standing still.  Trucks passed us and almost run over us. Common bus
thing.
 It was like sleeping with my eyes open.  So we got off at Lordsburg and 
decided we wouldn't get back on the Interstate for the rest of the trip if
we 
could help it. We ran some of the best two lane roads in the country.  
Through Safford, Fort Thomas, past the Grand Cooli Dam, Globe, right on 
into Scottsdale.  Just about 400 to 500 miles a day but the best view I
could 
have hoped for.

Next morning, headed out through west Phoenix up to Wickenburg and out
hiway
93 to Kingman.  When we wanted to stop, we stopped. When we wanted to take
pictures, we took pictures.  I got some pics that would make killer VW bus
advertisements.  There's this bridge over the Santa Maria river that you
just have 
to stop and climb around.  It's about a 500 foot drop to the bottom, almost
straight
down. On into Kingman, stop in Needles.  The seats in the bus were just a
little
hard after four days.

Next morning, we decided to try I-40 this time.  Less than 40 miles out of
Needles
my head hit the steering wheel.  We got off at the Kelso exit and turned
north
through the Mojave headed to Death Valley.  We hit Badwater Basin at dusk.
The bus never ran better, but I felt shorter, probably just in my mind. 
Came out
of the valley at about 8pm, climbed from 282 below sea level to over 9000
ft in 
about 35 miles, dodging the wild donkeys over the peak to Lone Pine.  If
you
ever get the chance to visit Lone Pine, this is such a place.  At the base
of 
Mt. Whitney.

Next morning, last morning, north to where I could cross the Sierras, where
it
wasn't snowed closed.  Just north of Bishop, around Mammoth Lakes, I had to

chain up for the first time.  Laid in the snow for about an hour trying to
figure
out how those things went on, got soaked to the underwear.  No worries, got
back in the bus, took my clothes off and drive the next 5 or 6 miles in my
BVDs.
Bus was warm and dry.  Only place where I had problems was somewhere
around the Devil's Gate going on the back side of the mtns. down into 
Carson City.  I had taken the chains off around Mono Lake where that long
flat
lake bed was covered with snow and not the road.  Devil's Gate was just a
little
slippery, but the bus held like a 4wheel drive.  

Anyway, on into Reno (no roads open before that) and onto I-80.  Kicked it
out of gear about Donner Summit and back in somewhere about Penryn,
right on into Roseville.  Did smell a little burning right after I got into
Roseville.  Turned out to be a bearing in the alternator and I changed it
the next day.

I said all that to say this: STAY OFF THE INTERSTATES WITH A VW BUS.
You head will bob up and down like that little football player you got in
the 
back window of the big car.  And your eyes won't even light up!

Take the back roads, plan for extra days, (I said DAYS) in the bus.  See
what
you can, the bus is a great vehicle to see it in.  If you have loved your
bus
right, your bus will love you back.  Find an oil change bay about every
four
days or so.  Check the bus over every day before you start.  Know where you

are and where your going that day, what cities and towns are likely to have

parts if you need them (you probably won't).

BTW, my bus is still in CA, and when it's finished my plan is to hit every
VW
show between San Fran and Atlanta on the way back. 

Sorry to be so long winded.

Cecil
