I just dropped by the local Wal-Mart and scored 2.  I was looking at them 
though and to me it seems like there are a lot of errors in the vehicles 
(details on the models that mix vehicle years).  Did you guys notice that?

Anyway...  They are still really cool toys.  They look great in my office.

I bet wal-marts across the land are experiencing similar bum-rushes of
toy-crazed VW folx.

I wonder if other enthusiast groups are as rabid; there seem to be be an
excess of viper and corvett toys on the shelf.  Either their enthusiasts
don't buy as many, or Dodge &amp; GM pay to have extras made.

 &gt; no VW sets at all. I looked up and there it was, on the top shelf and all
