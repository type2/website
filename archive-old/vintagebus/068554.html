Subject: RE: Muffler Noise

It is definitely muffler produced.  I can pin point it to be about mid muffler.  Actually ran this motor with a EMPI quiet pack for about a year with no noise.  Have had the muffler off 3 times in the last year, and even changed out the entire cooling system last week (For other reasons).

Still get the same noise.  I thought I read somewhere there may be something inside the muffler causing this.


Enjoy your day!
