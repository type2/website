Subject: Re: [VB] ordering vw part from US to Canada

Get the shipper to specify &quot;Parts for vehicle 25 years and older&quot; and you
will pay only GST, and lately PST were applicable....... no extra duty.

UPS tried to stick me with the &quot;customs&quot; duty from their $$ hungry broker
who also was loose with &quot;the rules&quot; to their benefit ( same part shipped one
month apart; vast difference in duty). Not only that the Canadian broker
firm at the time that asked to be paid in US dollars (great business
decision on their part). Anyway, several times I told them that Iwas to
clear it thru customs myself. When they refused, I told them to send it back
on more than one occasion........ the broker charge disappeared. Also told
them to put me on a list of future shipments that were to be cleared by
me..... assured they had such a list but never materialized with continued
hassle.

Anyway, don't need the aggravation anymore and get shipments thru USPS and
Canada Post. Cheaper duty procedure and the package gets there. And if it is
a high $ item, spend the extra bucks....send it express and traceable. Less
aggravation for buyer and seller....

According to import laws to Canada, if you list on the outside of the box
Parts for vintage car you don't have to pay duties. I will check into it
further.

weell

everytime i order part from US it seems we have to pay tax on car part even
old volks !!

Why isnt there a free trade agreement??

Anyway, its seems easyier through USPS and i give a fake Company id, but
through UPS its a pain in the wallet... i wonder why sometimes company i US
are stubborn with shipping through UPS and dont make us Choose.

I recently canceled an order from CB perfomance because shipping is too
high, and few of my friends just order stuff from RMMotorworks and were
shocked at the shipping price, even if they choose the Ground shipping, RMM
factured the high rate shipping....

Thats why i usually choose Ebay, its easier to accomodate with the buyer on
the shipping way...

I recently bought someting from BUGCITY.COM and now UPS called me to pay for
custom...arrggg .. i hate UPS !!



Please let us choose who we want to ship... !!!
