&gt; &gt;... SAVE MONEY ...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; I don't understand, is that when you stop buying small stuff for a while
&gt; so you can buy something big later?

i want to buy something big - another vw, so i will give up on something small - like food, er, i mean eating out, new clothes, repairs to the homestead....  if i am very frugal, in two months i should have enough for that big item....  greed *is* good!  &lt;grin&gt;

cheers,
