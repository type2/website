Subject: RE: [VB] gas mileage

 One of the first Mexican 1600 I installed over four years ago still gets an
average of 25-28 mpg.  This is a new Mexican long block with duel Kadrons
and 1.25 ratio rockers. The trans is a Rancho 3.88 with an 82 4th gear. It
is in a 64 21 window Deluxe that gets driven daily 80 plus miles rt in L A,
and is used for surf trips, home depot runs, etc.
 It has over 50,000 maybe 60,000 by now and the only problem has been a worn
out fuel pump rod.

ps. oil change and valve adjustment every 2500 to 3000 miles, with the
valves rarely needing adjustment

I find that the 6.6-1 compression ratio 1600cc sp in my '67(4.12-1 r&amp;p) 
gets, on average, the lowest mpg of any VW bus engine I've built.  It 
seems bullet proof and does not get hot even while driving it wide open 
throttle all day long in desert heat.  It gets 20-22 mpg on the open 
road WOT.  This is anywhere from 55-75 mph depending on wind direction, 
wind velocity and road grade.  The bus does get 25 mpg if driven at a 
steady 45-50 mph.  I do this when I drive on back roads here in So AZ 
down to the ranch in the Huachucas.  The low cr does seem to be the 
cause of the lower mpg.  The pay off seems to be reasonable performance 
without stressing the engine.  I wonder if people running the low cr 
mexican engines have noticed lower fuel economy?   Gary Gibson
