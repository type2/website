&gt; Britt, list,
&gt;   I really like bright colors on vehicles, especially easily dented vehicles. Here in foggy Fresno, my RAL2000 colored doublecab GLOWS, it's so bright. I figure it's 2-3 times more visible than a white or light colored car. Hopefully it burns through the cell-phone-dulled brains of the idiot drivers.

Bright???!!!!!  That DC is able to light up downtown Fresno, during a nighttime wave of pea soup fog from a half mile away! :-))
I've never had trouble spotting you.  I shudder to think the reaction of the poor soul who gets lost in their cell phone call only to glance up and see the pillar of orange decending upon them.  Kinda serves them right for getting so lost in the first place. :-))

My 1960 Triumph TR3 used to be a yellow of the same magnitue on the brightness scale, always managed to be seen by the other drivers, especially the drivers in the cars with the black &amp; white motif.  For some reason they are a bit more attentive than others.
