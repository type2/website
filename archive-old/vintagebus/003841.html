Sorry about the overly formatted wind tunnel posting, I know better.

Thanks for all the Bad Camberg reports and pictures!  You don't have to
mention the NOS and their prices anymore. Now I see why people were selling
such parts out of suitcases at OCTO and the Classic.

Thom,  hope the slicing and dicing went well. I've seen my knee in such a
state, no need to post pics. (There is a site with time-lapse movies of a
guy's orthodontal procedure, yechhh!) Hey, anybody make a time-lapse of a
bus resto?

Comments on Type 2's... Every doublecab owner has heard, &quot;Did they make them
that way?&quot; Do singlecab owners get that?

I'm web-authoring impaired, so I posted a pic of my DC project at the
vintagebus corner of www.egroups_dot_com . Look in the Vault for the poppies.
It's almost done, front &amp; back windows to install, bumpers, wheels and some
interior stuff.

Request.... I'm too tall for my '64 DC. Thinking of putting in vanogan rails
&amp; seat, which are narrower and can be welded in lower than the stock rails.
Anybody done this without cutting the original rails? Other solutions
except, &quot;trade it for a SUV&quot;?
