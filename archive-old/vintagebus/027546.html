I remember VWtrends doing a little write up on a kit made by Jacobs Electronics
that sounds like what you describe.  Thicker wires and other doo-hickeys that
bring back the full voltage to the headlights that you normally lose in the
stock wiring.  I'm recalling this from memory so I may be off.  I also checked
Jacobs site but didn't find anything that sounds like what we're talking about.
