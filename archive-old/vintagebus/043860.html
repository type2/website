Hello,

Most states have procedures for getting a vehicle with a junk title back
on the road. Here in Missouri, you have to have hte highway patrol inspect
your car to make sure that you didnt use stolen parts to rebuild it and
they will convert the salvage title back to a regular one.

I think some states dont offer this, and you are up the creek, but you are
probably okay, Just ask what it takes to get a car with a junk title back
on the road.

take care,

Steve
