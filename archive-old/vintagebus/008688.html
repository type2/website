&gt;so, last might i was working and i get a call from a guy named john. he
&gt;tells me that he's broken down in nashville


Well!   That *John* sure gets around!    If you check the AIRS stories page,
you'll see that he has given blood in preparation for this ,,, so to speak!

John sure helped out the CANADIAN contingent last spring after the EVERYBUS
camp!

I never get enough opportunities to say what is deserved!  so here goes
again!

I genuinely want to THANK the people....Thank You to The ingenious persons
who thought of the AIRS, Thank You to those that offer their names on the
pages for nothing in return ... helping others..   Thank You to the keeper
of the airs site  ......   Thank You to Type2..
I am sure John is Thankful too,,
:-)
