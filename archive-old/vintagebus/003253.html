  Hi fellow Volks, I have to pass on what I just went through this past weekend. I'm putting a new 3.88 in my, &quot;hasn't been on the road since 1988, 61 hatchtop Westy&quot;. I was told the old tranny was probably still good, oh yea? Well I have never driven this or any other bus for that matter but I believe in pulling motors and such apart to see what condition they might be in. I went to pullout the side gears from the old tranny to put in the new tranny, (from Ronnies), and they were stuck re:frozen in place. Well after using a sledge hammer, they  fought all the way out, I could see why! They had galled, ( welded) themselves to the tranny. Can you say 'TOAST'. I showed them to Ronnie-Old Volks, And he couldn't believe it. The PO musta run 'er dry! The moral being if I hadn't checked somehow I would have broken down somewhere. CHECK  things before they happen! Thanks Ronnie for your help! 
  Sorry for the long winded speech!
  Lou in Havasu
  61 Westy- a little closer to the first drive!
PS. Clara I tried your &quot;Grease, Grease, Grease&quot; chanting and I did feel better, also my neighbors now run away when they see me outside (???).
