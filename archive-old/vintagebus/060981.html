great
noise damper i would think. my friend had some liner put on the bed of hi=
s
pickup truck, he was pretty happy with it. i think it was less than $200.=

any reason not to do this? the inside of my bus is mostly covered by my e=
-z
camper interior so you wouldn't actually see it anywhere, except in the b=
ack
of the cabinets...
