Subject: Re: [VB] re:on saving stuff

I also agree with saving everything possible, but
there's the problem.  I had to rent additional storage
beyond the area around my shop and on my land outside
of town. Where does it stop?

We had a discussion just before Red Barn about how
many busses you own.  If you can count them, then you
aren't really saving everything you could.  I
literally don't know how many vehicles I own.  I know
about how many Studebakers, but VW's?  No way!
