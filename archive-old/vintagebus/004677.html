&gt;   I need some advice on the best/most economical way to ship a 1/3 length
&gt;non-wood slat rack.

On a bus that is traveling the direction you want it to go. No damage or
packaging costs.

After that, you would want to build a stout plywood box and ship it with a
moving company or common carrier with no particular timetable. For the best
deal at all, just ship it uncrated with Yellow Freight (the end result will
be the same,save the plywood costs) and they will destroy it before it
arrives. Then you file a freight claim, get your money, and buy one at the
other end. Simple.
