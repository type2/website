Subject: Re: [VB] Re: steering Box!

&gt; &gt;I just received a steering box out of a 65 bus that
&gt; is from a company
&gt; &gt;called Ross (pn: 6222010139). Is this a common
&gt; steering box or one of those
&gt; &gt;rare after market companies that made steering
&gt; boxes.

I seem to remember from my Studebaker collecting days
(still have a one ton truck at the Bus Co-op and a
bullet-nose sedan up in Placitas) that Ross made
steering boxes for Studebaker during the fifties, and
used a special lubricant.  I'll try to find more info
in the case that it's necessary.
