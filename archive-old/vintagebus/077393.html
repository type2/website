the bay window westy bed assemblies are slightly narrower than the
splits. so really unless the current bed fits tight to either side
(which would indicate someone making up the extra space w/ something)
it should fit well. I would recommend on whichever you pick to go with
the one that has the matching engine cushion. I find it uncomfortable
to have cushions of different hardness under me.
