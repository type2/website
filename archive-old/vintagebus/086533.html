&gt;&gt; I wonder if you could machine a fitting to go in the main jet holder
&gt;&gt; and/or float bowl plug hole?
&gt;
&gt; Actually, you could probably just replace the float bowl plug with a
&gt; suitably-sized hose fitting and run a length of fuelproof clear tubing
&gt; up the side of the bowl;

The reason I thought you might have to machine something up is that the
float bowl plug/main jet holder doesn't have a tapered thread, like most
hose fittings you might find in the US.  It's just got straight threads
and a gasket under the head of the plug.  It might be easiest to drill a
hole in a spare plug and braze a little L-shaped brass tube into it,
then connect the clear tubing to the brass tube.

&gt; the level in the bowl and tubing should be equal (Pascal's law?)

I would also suggest that the clear tubing needs to be rather taller
than the top of the float bowl; it needs to be open to the atmosphere
but it should stick up at least a couple of inches above the top of the
bowl, to help prevent accidental gas spills.

I'm not sure this is Pascal's Law, but I will wait for the official word
from a seasoned professional like George Lyle.  :)

&gt; Of course this would only be for troubleshooting and setting float
&gt; height, the regular plug would be swapped back for normal use.

It'd probably be good to wait until the engine was cool to swap the
regular plug back in, or pinch off the fuel line and run the engine
until it stalls from lack of fuel - this would mean that the bowl and
sight tube are *mostly* dry.
