Subject: Re: [VB] Re. Coat hooks and assist straps

Let me make this even more confusing.

My 65 Deluxe, which is a seven seater, has the strap and two hooks on 
the pillar right behind the cargo door, two hooks directly opposite on 
the driver's side and two hooks and a strap on the driver's side right 
behind the driver's door. The hooks are over the strap in both cases. 
That's 6 hooks and two straps.

&gt; My bus (65 deluxe) has 6 coat hooks and one assist
&gt; strap.  The strap is on the pillar right behind the
&gt; rear cargo door.  There are 2 hooks over the assist
&gt; strap and the other 4 are on the drivers side.  2 next
&gt; to the rear seat and 2 next to the middle seat. (On
&gt; the B pillar)
&gt; 
&gt; I have been told by Charlie Hamill that the 2 on the B
&gt; pillar should have only been one hook but i am 100%
&gt; certain that there were 2 there when i tore the old
&gt; headliner out.
&gt; 
&gt; hope that helped.
