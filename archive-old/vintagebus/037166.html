My understanding is that the crank start handle you have is for an

industrial motor.  There is a matching crank start nut.  I believe the

differences are to aid in cranking it with no rear apron for support.


The extra pin does not retract as far as I know but there is a matching hole

in the nut.

ya- those have a longer crank nut, kind of funny looking.
