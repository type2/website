&gt; Paint does not stick very well on top of chrome, right? I have chrome
hub
&gt; caps and I want painted ones. Should I just buy new primered ones?
&gt; 
&gt; What kind of paint shipped on vws?
&gt; 
&gt; Is there a place where I can learn about paint, types, techniquies,
etc?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Josh
&gt; 
&gt; josh, the chrome caps need to be stripped or at least scuffed with
400 grit sandpaper. as far as painting. practice,practice,practice.
learn how to apply primer with an airless sprayer. primer has to be
sanded anyway so you won't waste any money. hope this helps. terry
