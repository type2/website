Subject: Everybus 2005 chili contest

As you know, an Everybus tradition is the Saturday evening Chili
contest. Again this year, we will be judging the chilis offered. There
are, as always, two classes: Meat and vegetarian. In order to preserve
some semblance of sanity in this chaotic world, I ask that all
participants observe the following requests:


Hottest does not mean it will win. The other object besides winning is
to feed the hungry masses.


A legible ingredients list is MANDATORY in order to protect those with
allergies. I've seen peanut butter as an ingredient in chili. I also
once saw a person have a severe peanut reaction on an aircraft. We had
to make an emergency landing. I missed my connection. It was not fun. I
said unkind words.


Label your entry so everyone knows meat or veggie.


As the judges come by, if you care to make a presentation, do so. We're
human and can be bribed or amused. Some of us are easily amused. I still
think fart jokes are funny.

will start promptly at 5 P.M. Please have your entry at the gazebo on
time.


I would at this time like to thank my secret international panel of
judges who put their gastrointestinal tract on the line, and thank in
advance all you chili making folks for your help.
