Subject: Powdercoating

I'm in the process of doing the bodywork on my bus, and am considering
powdercoating my wheels, front emblem, and bumpers.

My front bumper is pretty cherry, and my rear bumper has some creases in
the overriders, and a couple of dents in the blade itself.  Overall,
they are in pretty good condition.

My question is, what will it cost to get my bumpers and wheels
sandblasted, the bumpers straightened, and powdercoated?  I'm pretty
sure that when the bumpers are straightened, body filler is used, just
as in bodywork.  Will the powder used in powdercoating adhere to the
body filler.  Anyone with any experiences, stories, or &quot;Don't Do This's&quot;
to tell.

Thank you,
Ed Richardson
