Subject: Re: 6V wiper motor rare?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Give it some time, seems all Bus parts got thur a cycle.  Granted your wiper motor isn't worth gold, but who knows what time has in store for us.  I saw the price of German fan pulley's triple when the machine broke down and the word got out that they wouldn't be fixing it.  And even with the large amount of 12 volt Buses VW made, these parts won't last forever.  There will be a time when Bus owners will be more than happy to score a 6 volt wiper motor and a volt-a-drop.  I hate to sound like Mr. Doom and Gloom, but it is going to happen some day, maybe not in our live time.
My great grand kids will proabley get rich of my parts stash!!
Peace, Love, and maybe I can get it all buried with me?
