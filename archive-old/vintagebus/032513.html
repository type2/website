&lt;&lt; Any locals out there have a set of cargo doors from a standard or deluxe? 
The doors on the 66 are trash. I don't need anthything but the doors 
themselves. Preferably rust free and straight.
 
 I have nice doors on the 67 kombi but they lack the headliner things and 
that plate by the handle on the forward door. Can trade them for similar 
condition doors i need.
