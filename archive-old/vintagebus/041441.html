Hi Meredith,
There are lots of opinions on this.  I think 4.125 is probably best for
15&quot; wheels using a stock engine.  I installed a 3.88 last summer and
watched the engine temps climb 30 degrees.  It also really dogs on the
hills, especially with the roof rack on it.  If you don't load the bus up
and have 14&quot; wheels, maybe 3.88 is fine.  It may be a personal preference
thing too.  I just feel like I'm working the engine too hard with the
3.88.  There are a bunch of people that like 3.88 best.  I think Ronnie
runs 14&quot; rims on his?  I put some 14&quot; rims on mine  but haven't really had
a chance to try it out yet and probably won't til spring, but it seemed
much better for the short drive I took it on.  BTW I was running big
215/75/15 tires on it with small nut RGB.  I recall my old 67
having a good gear ratio to it for a 1600 and I believe that year bus had
4.125 and I know it had 14&quot; rims.
I don't think you'll be too sorry if you go with 4.125, it gives a good
balance of speed and power.  Barb and Eric may have a different opinion on
this.:)
I got my Rancho 3.88 from Ronnie and it got delivered ahead of schedule.
Took me a good while to get it installed due to splitcase to tunnel
conversion and used plenty of Ronnie's phone time but he kept working with
me on it.
