&gt;Brake cleaner is basically alcohol, and I wasn't aware that it would
&gt;clean oil out of friction material.  Good stuff if it can!  For clutch
&gt;friction plates I tend to replace them whenever it's open so I seldom
&gt;face the cleaning problem.  Pretty much the same situation with brake
&gt;pads/shoes.


Usually brake cleaner is either a hydrocarbon solvent with some alcohol, or
a chlorinated solvent.  Both are somewhat nasty stuff, but degrease very
well.  BEWARE, I grabbed some brake cleaner (I think Prestone) that was
mostly WATER with some xylenes I think.
This stuff is useless.  Be sure what you grab at the FLAPS.  I should pay
more attention sometimes.   This stuff turns a milky white as you spray it
on.  It's does flush the particles off, but a hose would do that.
I like to use the nasty solvent type cleaners because they work.
Caution:
Probably I've said this more than enough but...
When using brake cleaners that actually do the job, be sure to wear nitrile
gloves, ventilate well, and if using hydrocarbon ones, keep the sparks away.
Chlorinated ones go immediately into your skin so use good gloves.
Disposable gloves don't work except for the Prestone type stuff.
