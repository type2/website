&lt;&lt; The threads in the case for one of my oil strainer studs is stripped (PO 
did
 it) :-).  Is there anyway to tap it for an oversized stud and not get
 shavings in the case without tearing it apart? &gt;&gt;
Hi Mike,
Yes it is no problem and if you just remove the tap often to clean out the 
shavings there will be practilly no shaving getting into the oil.  Especially 
if you use something to reach up and over to wipe anything out the sump hole. 
You can use the same kind of stud VW used for this repair that is 6mm half 
it's length and 8mm half it's length.  Eagle hardware have these in stock.  
Also this stud with a slightly longer length can be used to install a 
doghouse cooler on any pre-doghouse engines.   Eric&amp;Barb
