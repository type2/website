&gt; I am transporting one of my VWs from the San Francisco Bay area (Benicia

&gt; possibilities for help if I encounter any problems not fixable in the
&gt; &quot;field&quot;.

101 is the better route for you.  Slower and twistier, but as you say
closer to assistance.  I-5 is straight and boring, best for those who want
to get there fast.
