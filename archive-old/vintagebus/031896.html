&lt;&lt;  Any suggestions on what could be causing this? &gt;&gt;
Hi Wilder,
First remove and toss the solinoid relay!  Go through the entire wiring 
system from the battery to the front and back cleaning all connections and 
checking the slip on connections for tightness.  If any of the slip on 
connection are loose crimp them more closed with a pair of plyers.  Then buy 
a volt/ohmmeter and check the voltage at each connection point starting at 
the battery and going forward all over again.    Eric&amp;Barb
