Subject: Re: [VB] June VW Shows

Check out this page of VW show information for the East Coast: 
http://www.gti16v_dot_org/shoinfo.htm#shoindex.  The shows in Mohnton, PA on
June 8 and Litchfield CT on June 15 are both excellent and very well
attended.

The webpage also has links to other pages of VW show information.

&gt; Our local club is trying to nail down a date for our show that will minimize
&gt; conflict with other shows.  If anyone knows of anything (anywhere in the USA)
&gt; scheduled in June, and you could drop me a quick note with the date &amp;
&gt; location, I'd really appreciate it.
