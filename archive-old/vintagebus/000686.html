&lt;&lt; What type welder should I get (100-200 price range, less would be better)

 were to get one and from where?  &gt;&gt;
Hi Chris,
Get a wire feed welder mig will do, but mig, tig is better so you can weld 
aluminum.  In the long run you will save time, and money by getting this.  
Plus in a major brand like Lincoln or Miller parts should be easy to get.  
Our setup cost us about $700.00 including gas bottle years ago, so hopefully 
the price has dropped even more.  Eric&amp;Barb
