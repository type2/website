Subject: Re: [VB] m-code help.

&gt; Nick your bus doesnt have a M-plate cause its was made before M-plates
&gt; started (I assume your bus is an early october)

I went to take a look at a 59 Panel this guy in town had for sale that
didn't have an M-plate either. it was in the high 500,000's, but my April 59
Micro has one. weird?
