Subject: Clutch cable

I replaced my clutch recently, 

and now the clutch wasn't taking at the right place,

it seemed to &quot;fall&quot; off the Clutch pedal( it used to take low down on the
pedal, 

and now it was at the very top, the engine was revving whilst in gear) , 

So I made the cable shorter to try and fix this problem, but now

The clutch pedal comes up, and I have to assisted with my foot to help is to
the top, 

I Think It might be springs or something, Please Help
