 P.S.  One more thing.  Any part with an Audi insignia is hardly 'Old',
 IMHO.  Doesn't that date it post '75 or so? &gt;&gt;


Good morning, made in 75 or so is getting old.   And I suppose you can say 
that a part from the late 70s in the VW CCCO box in NOS.  Or does NOS need to 
date from the time the car was made?  would be NOS for a late bug?
