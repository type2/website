&gt;&gt;Does anyone know the specs (or VW part number) on the screws used to
hold the fresh air vent cover plate on?

I don't have my resources in front of me, but I do recall that being a
4.0 mm thread (bigger than the 3.5mm for popout windows and smaller than
the more common 5mm stuff).  I had several break when I rebuilt the
fresh air flap and had to drill and tap, so I have a tap in my shop with
a thread spec.  I can check it out when I get home tonight.

&gt;&gt;I assume it would be the same ones you would use for an ambulance
fan, too.

That would be my take on it.

&gt;&gt;I looked in my Parts Manual and found nothing!!!!

I never found that part in my Parts Manual either
