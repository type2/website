  Hi Volks,
   On the new 'backwards' fuel tank taps an easy fix is to go to your local 
hardware store an get a piece of 3/16 round brass tubing, it will slip snugly 
over the tubes on the tap.  Measure the full length of the longer tap tube
and cut the 3/16 to match.  Now cut off the longer tap tube &quot;equal&quot; to the
shorter tube.  Take the 3/16 cut piece make sure it slips over the short tube,
 get out your solder and tin the original short tube, sweat on the new 3/16 
piece and your tap now will work in the correct manner- cable in, normal.
Cable pulled out is now reserve.  Just use as little heat as possible.
   Of course I didn't have an original tap arm so I made one out of a carb
link and just made it to work the tap correctly to begin with.
   Hope that helps someone,
   Lou in Havasu
P.S. &quot;You know your in Arizona when.............
             sunscreen is sold year round and a formula less than 50 SPF is a joke&quot;
