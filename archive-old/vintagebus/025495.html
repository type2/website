Hi,

Sorry about omitting the year bus I have.  My Westy is a 1965.  Thanks!

&gt; &lt;&lt; Speaking of cots, can anyone describe (length of poles, color of canvas,
&gt;  shape of poles) what the cot for a pre 68 Westy looks like?  &gt;&gt;
&gt; Hi Steve,
&gt; What year Westie would you be talking about?  There were at least three
&gt; differant pre-1968 models!  Plus for the record there were at least two post
&gt; 1967 Westie hammocks and one pre-1968 Sundial hammock that we know of!
