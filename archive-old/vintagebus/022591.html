&gt;Speaking of trim on the rear corners, my '52 Standard has these.  The 
&gt;previous owner of my bus said they we're on the bus when he bought it in the 
&gt;late 60's.  This is a euro spec bus, so I wonder if that has anything to do 
&gt;with it.  Does anyone else know of any '53 and back barndoor standards, 
&gt;kombis, or single cabs with rear corner trim pieces?  

That's *all* you would have had; they didn't have rear bumpers standard yet.
