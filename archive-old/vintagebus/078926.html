Subject: Re: [VB] Distributor-odd #, can't find

Richard said:
 First of all, thanks to everyone who pointed me to the old Volks home site.
 However, the model I have,
 111 905 205T
 0 231 137 029 (Bosch #)
 I can't find listed anywhere. I was told it came off a 1600 Single Port,
 and was working at the time.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------

I bit my tonque the other day when I replied. I started the reply with &quot;you should never ever say
you have a 205(X) distributor since all VW distributors end in 205. The beginning 3 numbers and the last
letter(s) tell the story&quot;.  But I assumed you did not have one of the rare 111 T dizzys and you had the more
common 113 T. Wrong, that is what I get for assuming!  Here is what I did  write:  &quot;I assume it is a 113 905
205T?&quot;

I do not know the specs for the 111T, but if they are close to the 2 40HP dizzys listed, then it will probably
be either 15-21 or 23-28. Yes, the 113T is better at 32-35 but.....
Since you have a 1600 in your 62 crew cab, I still believe you would be better off with the SVDA from the
Beetle 1970 * 1600 Auto-Stick Trans
Distributor: VW 113-905-205AD or AE, Bosch 0231 167 029 &gt; 113 905 205AL, 0231 146 101 Can Use: VW
113-905-205AA, Bosch 0231 115 078
This will give you 30-33 centrifugal if you set it at 5 before [the 0 setting is for the auto trans] AND 8-12
vacuum when you accelerate. Nice distributor to use.
Yes, the stock 113T in a 69 bus is a good one for a stock bus, but if you have never tried the SVDA..... you
don't know what you are missing!
