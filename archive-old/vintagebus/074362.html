Too true! When I repaired my tail light wiring last November, removing tied in
trailer light wiring, I discovered that. Running a lug from one of the can
screws on the backside to a common ground point helped a lot. My lights were
brighter than they ever were before, and that's saying a lot for a 67 light!
My license plate light wire was brittle as well as my back up light wires. It
gave me a chance to replace all of them at once.

Hi Volks,
Just after cleaning and soldering connections in the wiring harness.  Adding
a ground wire system for the taillight buckets is a must for bright and clear
signals and running lights!
