Does anyone know where I can get hinges for my pop-out windows?
1962 15 window.
I have the glass and frames and the latches.
Just need a way to mount them to my Deluxe.
I got my bus with the windows out and hinges removed and missing.
Two were there, the ones on each side of rear seat.
Left side and cargo doors missing hinges.
I have four pop-out windows sitting on the seat.
I would like to get them in their holes.

Also who makes the jail bars now?
Where is a bar for the rear seat back?
