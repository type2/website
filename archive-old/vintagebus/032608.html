what carb is it? what is your compression? single port or dual port?
engine type shouldn't/won't matter, but AE is a bug,ghia,or bus engine.

&gt; Yep, me again.  I'm afraid I may have gotten things really screwed on my
66 camper.  I have been having a recurring problem holding an idle.  I can
adjust when it's cold to hold, then when the engine heats up, it no longer
holds the idle.  I adjust when its warm to where it holds, then when the
engine cools down, you get the picture.  Anyway I have been adjusting what
I thought was the idle air screw (per Muir) little screw behind the carb
plug.  And now I've got really acrid black smoke coming out the exhaust. 
VERY Fume-y black smoke, and nothing I do seems to help.  Now, it won't
hold an idle and I've got this smoke that burns your eyes if your in
garage.  I have replaced points, condenser, have static timed it as best as
I could.  Please HELP!!  What have I done???  I am also thinking this
camper may have a beetle engine in it, the engine code is &quot;AE 670527&quot;.  Can
anyone confirm or deny this engine type is beetle???
