... &quot;it felt good. cuz i know she really doesnt care what shes
ridin' or drivin'. also, we plan to drive away in it after the wedding and
ive heard her tell a few friends she excited about that.&quot;

I must admit that I am also very lucky when it comes to my wife.  I 
suggested getting a limo for the wedding and she turned it down only to 
spend the month prior to the wedding working on our 72 bug to drive away in. 
   I think sometimes she has more enthusiasm at the VW &quot;adiction&quot; than I do.

Just recently money has gotten tight after buying a house and 17 acres 
(plenty of space to work on VW's) I contemplated selling the 61 kombi.  Only 
to mention it to her and again get completely shut down.  She now has put 
many things off (like getting a dog she wants and making the curtains for 
the house) only to be able to keep the rusty 61 kombi.

I don't think I could ever find anyone I love so much that also loves VW's 
so much.

Mike

P.s.  I will also be at the Auburn Hills show.  (In fact I don't think my 
wife would let me be anywhere else!)   We both have been looking forward to 
it!!!!
