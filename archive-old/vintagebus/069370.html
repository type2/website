Subject: Re: [VB] Re: What H4's is everyone using in ther Buses?

Hooray !  I can't stand those fake &quot;blue&quot; bulbs either.  I see them all the time on the small import cars, but only for a second - them I am momentarily blinded.   On the other hand, they do go well with most spoilers and anodized windshield wiper arm covers.

&quot;blue&quot; bulbs from your Bus. Now. At best they aren't any better than
regular bulbs and at worst they are dangerous.
