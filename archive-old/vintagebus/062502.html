&gt; I'm mainly concerned about how well any kind of filling will hold up
&gt; if I haul stuff in there.
&gt; 
&gt; What have you guys done with your daily driver trucks?

 Wood slats or none, hauling heavy junk will scratch your bed/slats, but
since I think these trucks should be used for what they were designed for,
I got a 3/8&quot; thick reinforced rubber mat cut from a conveyor belt to fit
exactly in the bed w/ cutouts for the hoops connections.  This protects the
bed from dents/scratches etc., cuts down on noise from the engine and gives
a softer base for sleeping/playing cards/working on the engine etc.   And of
course its easily removable for &quot;show&quot; conditions or when your Vintage Nazi
friends come over to check out your truck!
&gt; 
&gt; Lastly, anybody out there done a DIY wood slat job? Any budget wood
&gt; available at Home Depot or Lowe's that will work?
Yes, but w/ the labor etc. you'll expend to make the slats/install them, I
wouldn't recommend a softer wood than the og white oak that came w/ the
truck. The white oak material is not stocked at Home Depots around here(Red
oak only) but shouldn't cost more than 30-40 bucks at a real lumber place.
Your real costs are in your time to fabricate/finish /install the slats &amp;
the wood $ is the least of the expense.
