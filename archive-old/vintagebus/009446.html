Does anyone know how to properly tune Weber ICT carbs?  I have gotten them to run currently, but they have a split personality...  They will barely idle then try to die (of course catch it with a little throttle) and then rev to about 2000 RPMs for a minute and then go back to the dying idle?

There is only two adjustment screws and I cannot figure what to do with them? The carbs have been rebuilt and seem perfect... Except for the tuning of course.

Thanks,
