Subject: Re: [VB] Copper or steel brakelines?

Paul-
STEEL LINES ONLY!
I would not trust a copper brake line with my life. Would you? 10 billion
cars out there w/ steel lines from the factory can't be wrong.

Copper is soft and when it rubs on something and gets thin and will work
fine till the first time you hit the brakes hard and it blows a hole in the
line. Plus copper expands w/ pressure more than steel and fatigues allot
more. I have changed out allot of copper hydraulic lines in car haulers and
they are running about 1500#psi working the hydraulics. The 2 most common
failures with copper lines were fatigue cracks at the fittings and chaffing
blow outs.

Also buy factory made lines. DON&quot;T try to make your own unless you are
trained in making the proper flares and have the tooling required flare
steel lines. Ask yourself as I do when ever I do brakes &quot;HOW MUCH IS MY LIFE
AND OTHERS AROUND ME WORTH?&quot; I am a truck mechanic and have been doing
brakes on vehicles for many years and when it comes to brake lines and
components I never take chances on &quot;iffy&quot; parts. I buy the best because my
life and many others are on the line.

I am the only one I trust to do my brakes. My parents sent my first car to
Firestone for a brake job. They put new brakes and rebuilt the wheel
cylinders. Well after 10,000 mile I lost a wheel cylinder driving home in
the rain. Single master cylinder system so all I had was a parking brake.
Got cut off by a guy coming out of a shopping mall and had to run up and
over a couple of lawns to avoid an accident. First lawn was no problem but
the second lawn was just roto tilled and planted. I sunk like a rock. Had to
call a partner to pull me off the lawn and go back later and fill the 12&quot;
trenches I installed.....lol. The lady who lived in the house was in her
wagon in front of her house when it happened and was glad I took out the
lawn and not the back of her wagon. So after this incident I have become
very AR about brakes and NOBODY does my brakes but me.

Do it right, pay the money and buy the best quality available.
