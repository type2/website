Subject: Re: [VB] Pearl Harbor revisited.


If I can be allowed off-topic... and this must be hell for the list
manager..... allow but this..

Myself, I, too, understand the gravity of this experience, such useless
slaughter, such rage, such sorrow..

Such useless waste of innocent, innocent people.

I suspect we're going to see and hear a lot of &quot;you're an American slash
you're not an American&quot; perspectives, and every newsgroup will endure
similar digression. But this is too important not to have every aspect
considered.

Cowardice for whoever it was to slaughter thousands of literally innocent
people while factually heroism to do the same if the flag is painted on the
tail of a B-52 at 35,000 feet for the people below, not combatants, to just
as suddenly be blown to smithereens.

I believe we might lack the moral high ground, other to say: it wasn't ME.
This wasn't me, either, folks. I just like driving a VW bus, and this will
be, with apologies, the first and last thing I ever write here off-topic..

It's this, and someone should say it: There's a damned good reason someone
from another culture would do this (I doubt if Pearl Harbor is anything more
than an academic reference), It's not to say they were right (they were, of
course, horribly wrong).

Just as there was a reason we could do and have done the same (meaning: not
kill thousands of military, but thousands of uninvolved, everyday
civilians). It's one of the crowning moments to the testament of human
failure, failure that everyone, in any culture, aspires to achieve:
Just a lot of people alive today have never seen this violence.
I have.

And many like me have.

If there's any worth in the &quot;mentoring&quot; concept (which I suspect), I've seen
it first-hand, and not on a TV screen in a comfy home. I've seen in war,
first hand.just as a teenager, not on TV, the hate in someone else's eyes,
just as I was taught as a patriot, this directed not at me at all, but only
at the nation where I was born..My life, or anyone's, or any number of
one's, immaterial. and, better yet, to be trivialized and exploited.
That very realization for those faceless foreigners who we have bombed that
there was, imagine for a moment, a prod for anger rather than cooperation.

On the only planet you have. What a concept.

That we as a nation, not as the victims, may have been long asked for it --
the heresy of this being only that it is stated here -- that being part of
the problem. This supposition is beyond consideration, which is a virtual
guarantee for violence on a grand scale that befits the only nation that
wold truly, truly looks to for leadership, leadership which is betrayed
usually by exploitation (if anyone would turn off their tubes and maybe read
something).

 If we, as a great democratic nation - tolerant (I love that) of divergent
views (which is why the word &quot;flame&quot; is unknown in the history of the
Internet), we should consider understanding via this fantastic medium what's
already on every newsgroup and mailing list devoted to other topics pre-WTC.
The United States has never existed as a separate planet, though we like to
think it, they and us are immune from all grievances and we, nonetheless,
must assuredly walk, without redress, like Jesus upon the water.

At risk of getting on some FBI list somewhere in such a free land, we should
ask ourselves: what and who have we believed that this is so shocking? Whart
part of this nauseating scenario can we put a spin on?

Mass media? Not after this.Certainly not, if you have access to mass media
outside our shores. We'r as jaded as they come. See JFK in '63. Watergate,
73, Hell, Clinton fercryinoutoud..

Naivte? Not after this.  In the so-called Information Age? Certainly not, if
you have access to a newspapers or broadcast with more than McNugget news.

This is then a failing of people to not particpate in involving themselves
with the world that surrounds them.

I think these asshole terrorists just adjusted that just a bit.

People, this is a real result of the real deal.

Honor yourself and your brothers, sisters, whatever/howeever you phrase it
in your own sociopolitico reference, by taking responsibility in whatever
fashion, for being a sentient human being, first, and then we will us, all,
world-round, have somethng to be proud of and to be in judgment of.
OUR constitution, to the exclusion of any other (which makes us so
superior), allows for a difference of opinion among all its citizens. It's
them foreign ones, noncombatants alike, we can -- and I suspect shortly
willl -- blow to smithereens.

Anyone seen to be a terrorist has the evidence to prove that belief in
either perspective.

If you drive a VW bus, among those at least who the VW bus is a kind of
temporal shift, I think there must at least be that one thought.

Suddenly.

But for any perspective, the fact of our circumstantial upbringing should be
redefined, should mean nothing, and our individual hopes and dreams and
innocence (or at least un-invvement in the world just because we live so
well) means nothiing when you die, anonymously, no fault of your own
ferchrissakes.

This horrible event, where thousands of innocent people have died, their
lives fucking gone, in the end it merely points to a pattern of mis-applied
agendas among the patriots of both sides whose political/religious/cultural
agenda they would force with violence and even sometimes with justice upon
their opposites, while most of the victims of any polical orientation,
religious orientatin or cultural orientation do just that: die.

What part of that last equation slays me that it is too much to ?

Why can't I just get into my bus and wonder why  that noise I just heard
wasn't the hub cap shooting off down to some un-fndable spot in the blocks
of buildings I've long passed?

Anwer: it must be me.
