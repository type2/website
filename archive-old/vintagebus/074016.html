Subject: My old bus

As I mentioned before, I sold my old '59 Kombi to a guy from the U.K. After
traveling the USA in the bus, he shipped it back to the U.K. He drove it
for a while then sold it.

The &quot;kid&quot; that bought it had a LAWYER for a father. The Dad apparently hit
the roof when he saw the bus and tried to make the &quot;kid&quot; return it and get
his money back. The owner says no way a deal is a deal. The Dad then makes
a list of everything wrong with the bus and sends a letter to the seller
telling him he is gonna sue him because of all the things wrong with the
bus. The seller had to eventually hire a lawyer himself. They ended up
settling and he now owns the bus again. He's been keeping me updated all
along. I'll refrain from giving my opinion on lawyers...that should be
enough to let you know how I feel. But anyway....

Here's the last message he sent me:
&quot;Hi Rex
I just wanted to drop you a line to let you know what was happening with
your old bus.
Well, the asshole who bought it initiated court proceedings to sue me for
the amount he paid for the bus. If I had fought the case and lost in court
it would have cost me .. #12,000 GBp. Yes 12k.
So, I had no choice but to settle out of court.
I offered him money for the repairs that he wanted to do, but this was not
enough..
In the end, I bought the car back off him.
Its now sat on my driveway once again.
IN SAFE HANDS !!!
see ya
