One of the best examples of factory support was the program MG had going for
a while.  MG-Bs were of unit body construction [not unlike a VW
bus/transporter] and the bodies died an early death due to rust.

MG arranged for new body/chassis assemblies to be available, so you could
rebuild your MG-B by bolting the mechanical goodies to a completely new
body.

&gt;&gt;  On &quot;support your old stuff&quot;...Other makes do this markedly better.
Ford has a division, SVO/Ford Motorsport, that sells performance
goodies through Ford dealerships.  You can get a catalog at the
parts desk of any US Ford dealer.  Some of the parts are genuine
Ford and some are rebadged aftermarket parts, but the point is,
the stuff is available.  While there is an emphasis on the later
models (since the Fox-body Mustang in the early 80s), they still
sell stuff that will bolt on to your '64 1/2 Mustang.  &lt;&lt;
