&lt;&lt; so why cant some of the experts here be in charge of commisioning a bunch 
of
 safari kits from some factory somewhere, make sure they are done right , and
 we could all go in on an order of 200 pairs or so, and get them cheap???
  &gt;&gt;


You would never get more then 20 people on the list to order. No one in their 
right mind is going to tool up for such a small order and if they did, no one 
would be able to afford them. It doesn't make good business sense.
