Subject: My Hoopty engine...ch.2
Mime-Version: 1.0

I'll start out by reminding that I'm kinda green in the engine department.

Today I went to adjust the valves on my engine. As I pulled the valve cover
off the #1/#2 side a buttload of gasoline fell out. #3/#4 side didn't. I
went ahead and adjusted the valves and put the valve covers back on. I
started the engine and there was fuel leaking from the #1#2 side. So what's
up with all the gas on that side?
