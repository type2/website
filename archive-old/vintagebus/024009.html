Subject: re;lower compression, main jets, transport

1,  when i build a motor and find that my compression is to high, or not
enough deck height, i install copper cylinder head gaskets instead of
shimming under the barrels,
1 i find that i won't have oil leaks under cylinders due to having an
extra surface to seal, 2 i find that the heads have less of a chance of
coming loose due to hot and cold
variations.and what ever else causes that. my JEROME motor has over 7000
trouble
free miles on it even after driving to JEROME and back with an oil temp
of 300 degrees
a piece of paper got in the fan didn't discover it till i got back, the
point is the heads have never been retorqued and it doesn't leak oil and
still has good oil pressure
i believe  in the head gaskets a long lifer for the vw motor. ps i kinda
fibbed, i did stop every 50-75 miles to let it cool down,
2. solex main jets are still available ,i stock 6 different sizes,
mainly for the duel kadrons
i install on different size motors, they come jetted for stock 1600
3,  again i will post the transport company , please write the number
down
save it, pass it on to a friend, use it whatever, this guy is good and
reasonable
