Hahaha! Lots of responses from the list and not a peep
from any magazine folk. Whatever. This topic just
struck me as being odd after seeing RK Smith at a
eentsy-teensy Community College show and a iffy show
out on Grand avenue over the years. Partly I was just
being a b*tch. RK is a personal friend &lt;hell of a nice
guy&gt; so no slam there-just to the assignment editors
and anyone with pretentious attitudes. A member of the
ABC said that they submitted photos and details of the
show to Trends, so keep your eyes opened. Having a
club member submit something is OK but not the point.
I was told by the mag editor guy, whose name sounds
alot like Bruce, that the biggest thing going on the
weekend of Jerome was some hillbilly offroad race.
They didnt see any value in publishing pictures of
people standing around drinking beer and smoking
cigarettes next to primered parts buses. OK, so they
didn't need to photograph me ;-) Whatever.
They missed an opportunity to capture people who
gathered from several States in order to have a lot of
fun and raise over $2000. for various charitable
causes.
Gotta go!,

As far as reading the magazines goes, I stopped
subscribing about the time that this list and the
internet came alive. Why wait a month when info is
fresh everyday?
