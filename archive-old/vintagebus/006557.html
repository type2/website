&quot;Is St. Board the patron saint of taxation?&quot;

They handle Sales and Use tax, Wine tax, Tire and Oil Recycling fees for Gas
stations, etc.  They're responsible for taxing items that change hands,
including vehicles.  And they're tough to deal with, at least from an
accountants point of view.  They don't practice, &quot;The customer is always
right&quot; for sure.
