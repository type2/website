&lt;&lt; how much should I tip him?

Reminds me of the time a Pollack saw an ad in the old Dallas Times Herald 
advertising &quot;Carribean cruise .... 30 ports of call ....$100.&quot; The Pollack 
couldn't wait. He breaks his neck getting down to the Port of Houston 
address. 

Sure enough, the Pollack boards a Galley ship, and they row on 30 ports of 
call. The 
ship even has a drummer beating the  candence ...BOOM! ! BOOM! BOOM! ,,, 
After the thirty ports of call, as they are rowing back into the Port of 
Houston,  the Pollack
turns around to the ole boy behind him and asks, &quot;Is ti customary to tip the 
drummer?&quot;
 
The ole boy behind him was an Aggie, who replied, &quot;I dunno ... we didn't last 
year.&quot;
