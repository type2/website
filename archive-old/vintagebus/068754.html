&gt;The VIN is 217070008 which I presume is a Type 21(Panel) made around
&gt;the end of '66.

One reference I have says
217 060 200  15 Nov 1966
217 071 764  15 Dec 1966
so yours was probably made in the first half of December.

&gt;This is odd as the plate also has 7/67 on it?

Late '67 VINs would be something like 217 130 xxx or above.  Are you
sure it's not 1/67 ?  I'm not too sure about the stamps, but in written
German, the 1 can looks a lot like a 7.  Usually the 7 has a little bar
across the middle to help distinguish it.

&gt;The only number I can find on the engine case has no initial H, only
&gt;the numbers 8900415.

I'd say it was originally a 1200 from around August 1964.  One reference
says 8 877 989 went into an early '65 model on 19 August 1964.  I don't
know if it was originally in a Bus or a Bug.

Originally your Bus would probably have had a 1500 with an engine number
in the high H 0 2xx xxx or low H 0 3xx xxx range.

By now, the engine you have has probably been rebuilt at least once.  It
could have been rebuilt as a stock 1200, or with a 1300 crankshaft and
bigger cylinders as a 1500, or many other things.  The only way to know
for sure is to take it apart.  If the Bus doesn't seem incredibly slow
to you, then it's probably not a stock 1200 anymore.  A stock 1200 made
about 40 hp SAE; a stock 1500 for your Bus made about 53 hp SAE.  On the
other hand, it could be a stock 1200 and somebody could have installed
an earlier transmission with better gearing for a 1200.
