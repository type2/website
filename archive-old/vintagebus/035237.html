***All information is for a 1967 Kombi***

Well, usually the light glows at night with the lights on and such but not 
during the day.  That is pretty common. On the way home 3 days ago I noticed 
the light was much brighter than usual.  I pull over, test what seemed to me 
to be everything imaginable and nothing.  Power everywhere, alternator 
pumping out the right juice and all.  The main lead into the fuse box on the 
right hand side, the big red one going into the last fuse on the right.  
Connects from the bottom.  Well that sucker was very hot.  Too hot to touch 
at the connector.  The fuse was cooking as well as the big red wire coming 
out of the fuse to I think, correct me if I am wrong, the ignition.  Now so 
far nothing has burned or melted but I have had that happen before and its 
not fun.  The wiring is all there and correct (no spaghetti)  Does anyone 
have any suggestions on what to check?  I might end up having to take it to 
Competition Engineering here in Tempe!  Been along time since I've done that! 
;)
Any help is appreciated!
