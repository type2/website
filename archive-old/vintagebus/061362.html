Subject: A Bus At Harrah's/National Auto Museum?

Ahh, but they still have my favorite vehicle of all 
time, Bucky Fuller's Dymaxion!

It had Bus capabilities in 1933! 

 -Harry in Fresno

&gt; The original collection had a kubelwagen, 
schwimmwagen, and a WWII VW
&gt; staff car.
&gt; No buses, though Harrah would probably have gone for a 
barn if one came
&gt; into his sight.
