Subject: wtb: Westfalia mattress foam

I have a 74 Westfalia with the Blue plaid

I need the foam for the lower bed.... the over engine foam is ok. but the 
seat is terrible!

If someone could provide me with used foam,, foam with the fabric,  and the 
boards..  I'd go that way... or new! :)

the only thing about going with used... I want basically 99 percent 
perfect... if it is still fluffy.. no cigarette smells or mildew is 
acceptable... if the material has a spot or 2 on it.. I am not really fussy 
about that.


or.. I am looking for the depth dimension as mine is sooooo deteriated..  I 
can measure the other dimensions..
and I am looking for the compression rate,, or density,, or how ever they 
rate foam,, and a place to buy it from.

Thanks for your help!
