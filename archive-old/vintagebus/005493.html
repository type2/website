On my '67 Westy, there is a wire (and in-line fuse) in the engine compartment (just in FRONT of the engine). This runs directly from the regulator hot connection and goes to the interior side lights (next to the windows on the driver's side). I think? this is original.

BTW, this is a great place to tap into for an engine compartment light.

Hope that helps,

&gt; Finally I have all exterior lights, blinkers and
&gt; high/low beams working.  My westfalia lights will only
&gt; turn on if the engine is on, probably not wired
&gt; correctly to the last fuse which is for the interior
&gt; lights.  Looking at the the westy parts manual it
&gt; indicates a fuse towards the back of the bus, could
&gt; this be my culprit. So close but yet so far. Also
&gt; checked by flicking the rear interior light switch by
&gt; the steering wheel, no luck, does work for the normal
&gt; rear light! What a blast it was driving to the bugout
&gt; this past weekend.  Love driving my spitty.
