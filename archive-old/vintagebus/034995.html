There is a really cool red Double door that cruises to the Vintage meet in
Seattle every year and it has a Meat Packing  logo on the sides. It is
really cool. It is exterior only as well. How about this Thom...picture all
a really bright glossy white...then some big dots...maybe primary
colors...and to top it off a big Wonder Bread logo.

Good luck deciding. I really like the idea of a yellow Bosch bus but you
definitely would want to cover any Dove Blue that would be a hideous
combination. Yellow outside, Yellow cab area and primer cargo.
Just a thought,
