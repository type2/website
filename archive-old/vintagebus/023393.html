 &gt;Well, I didn't see this vehicle, but I'm going to speak up. Its amazing to 
me 
 &gt;that I and others who customize busses (correctly not cheaply) are 
 &gt;criticized, yet a &quot;junker&quot; like this is praised!

 I could not agree more, Jerry!
 
 
 In my opinion, this is the way to restore the a bus:
 
 -Fix ALL the rust (for safety)

ha hahahahhahah

okay, a guy from NORWAY hears 'rust' and gets a mental picture COMPLETELY 
different that what they cal 'rust' in Arizona.

they salt the roads in some places, which creates salt rust which can make 
the frame unsafe.    THis does not happen in Arizona.   the rust tends to be 
from paint flaking off from excessive sun.  A little rocker rot.  maybe.  you 
would drool at the solid buses in the  desert.    Well, I would.  Look... 
solid rocker panels, I thought those were a fairy tale.   In areas where salt 
rust happens I see the point of fixing it first - it can be structural.  

rust in the PNW tends to be holes in the front floors and rockers from window 
seals leaking.   sometimes the outriggers and jack points are gone.  but the 
PNW rust does not make the vehicle unsafe to driver, it is not structural.  
It rains a lot here, as in often and relatively constant high humidity.   
Just cause it may not be raining now (well, it is) doesnt mean it wont in 
half an hour.    Lewis and Clark wrote of over wintering at the mouth of the 
Columbia, and how for 40 days it had not stopped raining for more than 30 
minutes at a stretch (and of how they were tired of camas root and dryed 
salmon, and had all picked something up from the local Indian ladies)

here I do brakes first, and major steering problems, window seals come before 
new paint.

I think people approved of Brian's gumption hell for leather get the bus 
going from pulling it out of the weeds.   I didn't think it was unsafe, nor 
rusty.  I heard it had new brakes.    I didn't see why the cooling system was 
disconnected though (no fresh air hoses, no air cleaner, no apron) some 
things which are fairly quick to install.   


I can see the point,  me and my ex went and drove 500 miles in a 67 westy 
full of stuff (tires, motor, etc) to get a 54 barndoor that had not run in 
decades, spent 3 days in dust rebuilding it, installing engine, new tranny 
boots, finding gas tank  and knocking the pine cones etc out of it and 
installing it and new fuel line, doing wiring, complete brake job including 
metal lines and rubber hoses,  welding throw out arm, etc etc etc.  Started 
it up and tooled across town and back (total of 1/2 mile) The guy we got it 
from couldn't believe it.  Then we drove 500 miles home.  It was cool.--WE 
Must Save Them!!!  We wanted another barndoor.  It still had no front shocks 
(awol) and one of the back ones was broken. It popped out of 4th upon 
decceleration.   The king pins were shot.     BTW the good used king pins 
that went onto that 54 were from a spare beam that was with a ratty 51 deluxe 
that Steve Woods had just got from E Germany after the Wall fell, turned out 
to be (years later) the shiny lowered 51 Terry Delaney drove around at BBTB.  
Small world.  


Jerry Jess award is his personal choice, AFAIK,  and isn't 'best of show' of 
prettiest restored bus' or ' best deluxe', just his choice.  I think it went 
to Joe and Margaret at Jerome 98, some friends of mine with a late Bay westy, 
because of the extreme and very well done hippy dippy mural all over the bus. 
 I think UJJ likes hippy dippy.

I do think the SW crowd have a certain nostaglia de la boue, but not exactly 
that, more of the fix the damn bus and drive it ethic, which doesnt tend to 
include froufrou stuff like shiny paint, but I could be wrong.  I like the 
relaxed feeling 


......................
 -Then fix the brakes (no need to fix brakes on a unsalvable bus)
 
 -Fix the suspension (steering and shocks)
 
 -Electrical (Lights to keep it safe)
 
 -Fix the mekanical (gearbox and engine)
 
 -Then the paint (to stop it from rusting)
 
 -Rubber (to keep the interior dry)
 
 -Interior
 
 If you were to be stopped by the Police in Norway with any major rust on 
your car, you would lose your license plates until the rust is fixed. It may 
be tough, but it keeps the roads safe.
