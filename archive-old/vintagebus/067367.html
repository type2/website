Subject: re: [VB] Re: Anyone from NorCal going to BBB?

Whatever happened to Dave Heard, Eric the hand, the Bus Farmers, the Red Barn
crowd, Some of the old CCC whack pack and the Oregon crowd? Personally, I miss
seeing Mark Smith, 'Ghia Connection Scott, The BusFarmers, Mark L. and Rick
Crandall.
God willing, War-postponing and income pending I might make it to the
Redbarn/Kelly shows this Spring. At least it's a thought.

BottomLine:
If Karl, Harry and Rex can make it from Central/Norcal then I say Thom can make
it.

Come on bee-otch! put that yellow bus on the road!
I promise to provide you with an Odoul's Amber...
