&gt; &gt; The one thing I forgot to mention was that the second rim that
previously balanced OK and is now  apparently &quot;bent&quot; never saw
the road. It was the spare.

&gt; It could happen.  What if there was a stout person sitting in the middle
of the front seat, in front of the tire, and you did a full-throttle
launch of the Bus from a stoplight?  The multi-g accleration might push
him or her back in the seat hard enough to bend the rim.

Either that, or the spare was for a bug and was involved in an accident!
