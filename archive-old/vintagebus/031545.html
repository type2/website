&gt; Yep, the 2nd dome light is above the rear window, and is triggered by
&gt; the toggle switch on the left side of the speedo pod.  I was just at a
&gt; VW show in NE Maryland yesterday that had 2 doublecabs, and neither of
&gt; them had the 2nd dome light.  The owners didn't realize this because the
&gt; POs had also rewired the toggle switch position for other things--like
&gt; switching an aux. heater fan in the heater duct.  The dome light is the
&gt; same assembly as the other one mounted overhead.

must have shown up in one of the later years.  My '60 does not have place for
light #2 nor does it have the switch.
