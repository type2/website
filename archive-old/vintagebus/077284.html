Subject: 67 bus shell to trade for spare engine + FREE 79 with title

Howdy Y'all,
I am needing to clear some space in the barn.  I have
a 67 bus shell that I'd like to trade for a 1600 or
1500 engine.  The bus still has a lot of good usable
parts left including:  Tranny (unknown condition, PO
said it pops out of 4th gear), both front windshields,
Both cargo doors (no handles or windows),  a
full-width rear seat that is really dirty but in GREAT
condtion otherwise (I think it is gray basketweave
vinyl, but its hard to tell with all the dust on it!),
Both front doors including the glass frames with
working sliders and wing vents (but no exterior door
handles), good uncut dash, steering wheel &amp; steering
mechanicals, 4 &quot;wide five&quot; wheels with old tires on
them, a front 2/3 bench seat (needs recovering), rear
hatch with glass, still has some good sheet metal
including a clean un-crushed nose. 
The following have been REMOVED: pop-out windows on
side, dash gauges, brake mechanical parts, wiring
harness is complete but sitting in the front cab, no
rear apron, no dash switches. And NO Title, sorry.
I also have an old 79 sunroof bus shell with a smashed
nose, this bus has already been scavenged for parts,
but it does have A GOOD TITLE IN MY NAME, good sunroof
clip, and good doors.  This one is FREE if you come
get it!
I am lcated just North of Cincinnati and I can deliver
one or both of the buses up to 150 miles from
Cincinnati (for a fee of course!)
I will also listen to any cash offers or other trade
offers, so don't be shy.
Pix available upon request.

Peace, John Baker
