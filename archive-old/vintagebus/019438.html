Yes, but it'll take a lot more and a lot longer.  Kerosene's a better
solvent for this purpose, and the disposal problem's pretty much the
same either way.  Don't forget that most lamp oil is kerosene, so it's
pretty easy to get. You might want to avoid the scented ones, though;
then again, I suppose it'd be one way of improving the exhaust
odor....
