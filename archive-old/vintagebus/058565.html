Subject: Bumper ID question

Bug content:

While at the swap (non VW) this morning I came across some OG bug (pre
67-non sloping overiders) bumpers for real cheep.  I did find a VW stamp on
the rear one and was wondering if anyone could tell me what it means.  It
is a 3 then the VW mark and then a 6.  Is this like M plates where the
first # is the month and the second # is the second digit of the year (ie
March of '66)?   I could'nt find a mark on the front bumper, but the
insides are painted very heavily.

Bus content:

How were the VW drags and swap at Irwindale race way in L.A. today?  I
could'nt make it with the pack of little ones I was toting around.

Steve
