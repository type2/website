You think this discussion on distracted drivers
concerning cell phones was vociferous.  Ya shoulda 
been on another list when someone mentioned his new 
vehicle and having to transfer 15 antennas and 
associated radios, and how hard it was to pay 
attention to all of them while driving 115mph 
with the emergency lights flashing and the idiots 
with their cell phone not paying attention to him!

He needed the asbestos gear he uses at work for 
that thread!  Oh yea, he drives an SUV.  He was
able to cite laws that allow him to do that, and
the special licenses he holds, and training he's
been through.  He escaped unscathed, not so the
indignant clown who tried to flame a firefighter.

Still, I'd rather have another bus than an SUV.
My minivan won't last forever . . .
