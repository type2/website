Subject: 1965 VW Bus Question

By way of an introduction, I am a new owner of a 1965 Bus.  Actually, 
this bus is for my son who fell in love with it the first time that he 
laid eyes on it.  Although it has some issues, it is sound and runs 
well.  The main issue that I am contending with are the exterior door 
handles.  The issue is two fold.  First someone tried to break in by 
putting a screwdriver in the lock on the drivers side, this destroying 
the cylinder (I think).  Secondly the prior owner has misplace the key 
that open all the doors (cant be too mad at him as he is my future 
son-in-law).  So what I have are four locks without a key.  One solution 
that I initially developed was to replace all the handles with new 
ones.  That sounded easy until I tried to find replacement handles for a 
1965 bus.  Everyone seems to have dandles up to '65 and then the later 
60's on, but conveniently omit 1965.  What am I missing?  Are they that 
different?  Are the other years that can be substituted so that I can 
obtain parts from places like bus depot and Wolfsburg?  One of the 
gentlemen at bus depot suggested that I submit the question to this 
group and he said:  &quot;They collectively know more that we will ever know.&quot;

Any help will be appreciated.
