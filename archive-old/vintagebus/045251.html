nice blasters at sears for less than a hundred bucks think mine was like 69.00
works awesome if you got a big compressor to power it . it holds fifty pounds 
of silica sand . The wife got it for me for christmas last year. no 
complaints here!!!!
it took a while but i blasted my whole, 58 panel down to metal .
