&gt; the adjusting nut is backing off? or cable stretching?

Hi Volks,
Could be those causes, but could also be bad driving habits.
  When stopped on the really steep uphills apply foot brake and then the 
E-brake and then when taking off the E-brake while the right foot was busy gunning 
the gas a bit to get going again.
  We had a friend in Seattle when this happened to him he would keep gunning 
the engine and partly disengaging the clutch to keep still on the uphills.  He 
went through quite a few clutch disc and even burnt several clutch pressure 
plates so badly the springs inside them lost thier spring!
  It also helps not only the clutch parts last alot longer, but also the 
engine when shifting into a new gear when in motion to try to get the engine RPM 
as close to the tranny RPM when letting out the clutch.  If you succeed your 
bus should keep the same or close to MPH without any or at least much lurching 
deceleration or acceleration.  Do not release the clutch too slowly or you are 
just fooling yourself by again slipping the clutch instead of getting the 
correct RPMs.  Once the clutch is fully engaged then give the gas pedal a push 
down to increase MPH.  About the only place this does not always work is on very 
steep uphills.  Of course if there is a semi-truck flipping end over end and 
coming up fast behind you then &quot;Damn the torpedoes (19th century sea mines), 
full speed ahead!&quot; and speed shift like mad.
