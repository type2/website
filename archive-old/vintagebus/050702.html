Subject: Re: [VB] Running cool, too cool?

Hi Al,
Did you install a thermostatic bellows and flaps?  If not the engine will not 
get up to operating temp in cold weather and even when it does it will cool 
too much when you get into stop and go traffic.  This makes the engine expand 
and contract in various way that are not condusive to engine longevity.  
Rings and pistons do not expand to thier proper diameter and thusly do not 
seal well to the cylinder.  It also keeps unburnt gasolene and water mixed 
into the oil in the engine instead of vaporizing to be sucked up back into 
the carb, which shortly reacts with the oil turning it into more and more an 
acid.
  Also would take inspect the interior of Dansk heat exchangers with the 
muffler off.  Apparently Dansk sells two qualities of heat exchangers. One 
with interior fins and one without.  We have only seen the latter so far.  
With it being night or a dark garage you should be able with a flashlight to 
just peer about 6&quot; past two bends in to see fins on either side that 
dramaticly increase the interior surface area to exchange the heat from the 
exhaust properly.  Without these fins you will not only get lousey heat 
during the winter, but higher engine temps during the summer.
