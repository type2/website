you have to be careful buying these gloves, MAKE SURE that they are chemical
proof, I bought some costco and the minute they hit solvent or brake cleaner
they disolved and became useless, VWHoward brouth me some that are chemical
proof and I also bought a box from NAPA that are safe for 12.00 for a 100,
the extra cost is worth not getting chemicals in your bloodstream from
cleaning parts .

You can also find the gloves at the wholesale warehouses like Costco/Price 
Clubs, or SAMS. And they are usually very reasonable

 I've been using latex rubber gloves (like surgeons use or like rectal
 examiners use (streeeeeeeeeeetch - SNAP!) and I can get them at a pretty
 good price bulk.  I can get a plastic bucket of 300 of them for $32.5 &gt;&gt;
