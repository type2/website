&gt; Yes, that is the type we have seen in old Popular Mechanics articles as a
&gt; &quot;new&quot; add on to your late 50s or early 60s auto.  So far as we have seen
the
&gt; only sold by VOA specific ones that were for bus went into and on the rear
&gt; roof of the bus.

I have a VWOA unit that mounts to the roof just behind the front seats.
Supposedly from a '67. Has forward and rear facing vents. The condensor
mounts under the bus between the frame rails. My singlecab had the
evaporator unit from a Ghia in it when I got it. Same bus condensor
underneath. The Ghia stuff was a nice fit, although it would have probably
been a little snug for the passengers knees. Never tried it, but I bet it
worked like a champ in the tiny singlecab space.
