&gt; I want to switch from my 34 PICT3 carb to a 30/31.  I found a H30/31

&gt; ignition and stock '71 vacuums dist.

If you have the stock vacuum distributor, you shouldn't have a hesitation
problem.  If so, look for a fix before you play carb games.

If you have an 009 distributor, then the 30/31 will make the hesitation
less obvious, but it doesn't cure it entirely in my experience.
