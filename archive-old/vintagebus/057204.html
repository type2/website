Subject: Re: [VB] Bentley Workshop Manual...invaluable!

I'd like to take this opportunity to plug my Bentley Manual Campaign: 
http://vintagebus_dot_com/bentley.html  In short, I'm working with Bentley
to get them to do a pre-'63 version.   They're researching the 
material now, and still trying to get a feel for it's viability.

&gt; Recently, I posted a question about the repair of loose
&gt; lower front door hinges. I received many responses (thanks
&gt; to all!) and Eric&amp;Barb suggested I consult a passage in the
&gt; Bentley Workshop Manual for details.  Well, I didn't have the
&gt; manual... but with a quick call to Ronnie, I am now the proud
&gt; owner of the most valuable piece of reference material about
&gt; our buses...bar none!  I have been drooling over the pages for
&gt; hours (I received it this afternoon) and it has answered many
&gt; of my nagging questions. This has been the best $75(plus
&gt; shipping) I ever spent on my bus. I just had to tell someone...
