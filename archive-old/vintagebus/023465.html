Hi everyone,

Does anyone have a 6 volt generator  that has been rewound to give 12 volts,
or anyone have an old Porsche generator that is already 12 volt but with the
OD of the early 6 volt housing.

Also looking for a good oval window windshield wiper switch.
Any help would be greatly appreciated

Thanks in advance
