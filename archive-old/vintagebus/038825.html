Hello

In Denmark we have a problem with mist inside our windows in cars, and in a
21/23 windows bus, it's a problem.
We use a electric wire to remove the mist from from rear window. That I have
in mind are, could you put a electric wire on all the windows except for the
front doors windows.
What should I be aware off, if I do this and do anybody know where to buy
this wire by the metre ?

Ciao
