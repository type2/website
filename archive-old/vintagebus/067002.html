Subject: Tank Suck update

Yep, You all were right. I try to blow through the vent line where it comes
out from the top of the tank and NOTHING! Clogged tight.  Turns out that after
investigating I find that the tube runs up into the area where  the side vents
are, then back down and into the engine compartment. Where the metal line
comes into the engine compartment, there is a rubber hose attached leading to
the charcoal canister. Well, guess what? The rubber hose was kinked right
before entering the charcoal can allowing no ventilation of the tank.  So this
stupid little kinked rubber hose has caused me 2 engine pulls and 2 fuel tank
replacements in the past 8 months! And is probably the cause of an idling
problem I was having which made me buy a new carburetor.  
Ahh well, live and learn I guess. Its a good thing I love my bus so much or I
might get pissed!
Happy Friday all, and go check tose hoses on your bus!

Peace, John Baker
