Subject: Re: [VB] Engine lid seal for '67 question?

find a bay window in a junkyard w/ good seal.  The width is the same, but 
splittie lids are taller, so splice in a piece on each side from yr old seal.

&lt;&lt; Are there any recommendations for a good repro engine lid seal (as close 
to original German) and where to source one? Or does anyone have a good NOS 
one to sell for my '67 Westy....
 
 Thanks in advance.
