&gt; Well, suppose this happened at an opportune time (ie: Friday)...

&gt; I've got an electrical question for the crowd...morbid tho it might be.
&gt; Last night I went to replace a fuse in my camper and didn't think that what
&gt; caused the fuse to blow initially was still in place.  I was in an odd
&gt; position and, clearly without thinking, used my index finger to push the
&gt; fuse in place.
&gt; 
&gt; BZZZZAP!
&gt; 
&gt; I've never felt the incredible pain that an electrical burn can cause.
&gt; After that, I never really realise how often I use my index finger!  LOL
&gt; But what I'm strangely curious about is just how many volts coursed thru my
&gt; finger as that fuse popped.

Sorry to disappoint you, but it was only 12V.

However, the current only had a short distance to go, and the burn that
you experienced gave the current a low-resistance entry to your flesh.
The result of short path and low resistance is that you _really_ felt the
shock!

It's the amps that kill!
