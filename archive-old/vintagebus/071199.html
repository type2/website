Subject: Re: [VB] Solex 34 PICT-3 with 009 distributor

&gt; You don't want to use that carb with the 009 distributor.  The only bus
&gt; ('71) that came with the 34 carb used a dual-vacuum distributor
&gt;


Using a vacuum advance distributor will give you an average of 4mpg more
than a 009 will with a 34 pict. With the exception of very early buses, they
all came with vacuum advance distributors. In fact, most auto manufacturers
did too. There's a reason.
