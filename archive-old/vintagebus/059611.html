Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [T2] Rap on distributors


&gt;The timing with my 009 would start to 'scatter' once the rpms got over 3K.
&gt;I switched to my Mallory unit, and it holds rock steady all the way up to
&gt;7500 rpm (different motor!).
&gt;
&gt;I think it's a quality control issue.  My 009 was less than a year old, and
&gt;was probably as precise as a unit 20 years old.   :-)

yeah, i would only run the german 009s till i ran out of stable ones... i
had ONE decent brazillian one that finally chewed thru the fibre washer and
got too much play... need to rebuild that 'un, too.

i heard at a swapmeet that you should &quot;buy the chrome 009s cuz they might
have better quality control on the shiny ones!&quot;  LOL!!
