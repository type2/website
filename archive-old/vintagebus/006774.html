About 8 PM last night as a group of us were hanging at my shop a beautiful
site appeared out of the desert sky, a cube van with the uglyest trailer
you've ever seen, but the beauty was what was on the trailer, my 61 side
loader single cab and the original paint (surface rust) 57 single cab, the
2000 mile journey has just come to an end. We all proceeded over to my house
as I did not have any room in the shop or in my lot behind it for any more
buses, to unload my treasures. Getting in the side loader to drive it off
the trailer put butterflys in my stomach, got in, turned the key and
varoooom without even touching the gas pedal, I proceeded to drive it off
the trailer and park it to help unload the other bus, did my duty of paying
the trucking bill, BS&quot;ed about the other buses the delivery man found on his
journey to AZ. bid him farewell then proceeded to go on a test drive. The
test drive was awesome, now I do belive that the speedo is correct at 21,100
or so miles, tightest steering box I have ever felt and the ride was great,
even on the old Goodyear bias ply tires, a few problems did crop up which I
will proceed to repair next week, along with a complete going over, which
includes, pulling and replacing all cables (greaseing also), drain and fill
trans and engine, drain the gas  tank, put a new screen in and repair the
petcock, check all the brakes (po just put all new wheel cylinders, hoses,
shoes, bearings etc. in), do the wash and wax thing and drive n enjoy. I
think I got lucky finding a bus of this caliber and I don't have to do that
much to get it roadworthy!!

ps. see whoevers going at Pomona, I'll be there around 10PM, Row 33 Sp 27
still have to load up, service the bus for the 600 mile r/t and stop on the
way in to check out the VW graveyard I heard about.
