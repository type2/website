Is the system still 6 volts?
Which  gas tank are you using?
We are using the bay sender and tank . Runs 25 (empty) to 90 (full) ohms ????
(just can not find our notes) with a  68 bug speedo? with the gauge in the
speedo ( no holes to cut )
We did use a 10 watt 10 ohm resistor in series
This put the gauge within one gallon for the full range
Hope this helps
The ground from the sender can be bad but that probably is not your problem,
sounds like the sender (sorry)
P &amp; C
59 DDR w/t w 65 EZ camper and bay gas tank on 12 volts

&gt; Does anyone have a good way to test a gas tank sender?  The Bentley manual
&gt; Ohm readings at 7 gal and it was .72 Ohms and then empty and got .68
&gt; Ohms....  I think this is more of an anomaly that good data because the
&gt; range ought to be like 10.0(full)-0.73(empty) according to Jim at the VDO
&gt; help desk.
