&gt; I bought a 66 deluxe a while back and noticed a

&gt; dash next to the ashtray. I just assumed it was a
&gt; hack by a PO. The knob is
&gt; just like the other factory ones on the dash. While
&gt; looking at Dan Howards
&gt; 57 pics I noticed he mentions an accessory cig.
&gt; lighter, but as far as I can
&gt; tell it's mounted a little lower. Could this be a
&gt; dealer or possibly a
&gt; factory option? Maybe I need to pull it out and put
&gt; it on Ebay before I take
&gt; it to Rick Taylor! This could be a $300 item! Just
&gt; kidding Rick!
