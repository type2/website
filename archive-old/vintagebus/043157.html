For the past 28 years I have been simply glueing the bolts in those holes
with yellow 3M weatherstrip glue. You clean up the front of the starter
hole and that tranny hole, plus clean up the holes themselves, then clean
up the front 1/2&quot; of the two bolts. Slop the glue under the head and first
1/2&quot; of the bolts, then pop them thru the holes. Get your engine in there,
turn down the nuts, and you're done. Next time you pull yer engine, the
bolts are in there, perfectly positioned. You only re-glue when you've
replaced the tranny or starter. They hold well for decades, and you can
put those nuts on in seconds. 

There's a special tool that gets to those nuts for loosening and
tightening, as well. Sears sells it. It's the grey 17/19 mm flat ratchet
wrench. It finds the nuts in seconds, and gets them on or off quick,
without reaching back there or hassling anything. Even with the doghouse
cooler. I can remove or install my engine in 15 minutes, starting from
bumper on car (67 deluxe), using the glued bolts and this tool, which
costs about ten or 13 bucks at Sears.
