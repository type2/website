Subject: Re: [VB] 2-stage Two-tone?

&gt; What's the method for spraying a 2-tone paint job with a
&gt; basecoat/clearcoat system? You have to let one color dry before you
&gt; can mask and paint the other color.

This is correct. But, base dries quickly. You spay the 1st color, wait an
hour or so, mask the painted area and then spray your 2nd color. Wait for
the 2nd color to dry, remove the paper on the 1st color, tack the whole car
and shoot the clear.
