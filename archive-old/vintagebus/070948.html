Volk-a-maniacs,

Well, Woodburn was pretty big this year.  A lot of nice vehicles there.
That's it.  Sorry.  Here are three pictures as well as the ones for the rest
of this e-mail story.
http://community.webshots_dot_com/album/75454343hZLjwJ

I spent most of the show fighting with... yep, you guessed it... an ignition
switch problem.  It shorted somehow and wouldn't start the car.  The starter
would spin, but no juice to the distributor.  Must be that time of year or
something... beware.  How I got around it is kinda interesting.  A fella
stopped by and gave us a few hints.  He essentially hotwired the coil to the
tail light and vroom, off we went.  Interesting trick, until he told me that
is how one steals VW's... Time to get that engine lid lock.

Anyway, the worst of the day was to come about 15 miles away...  I was
cruising up I5 toward Portland and I started to loose power.  Thinking... Ok,
I am going up a hill... then down the other side, I lost more power and
finally I saw the smoke billowing from behind and pulled over as the engine
just quit.  Awe crud.  The wife and our 16 month old in the back.  I jump out
(at a safe distance from the 70+ MPH traffic) and open the engine lid to find
a lot of oil had blown out of the hole on the passenger side of the fan
housing (pictured here:
http://community.webshots_dot_com/photo/75454343/75455173IkgCXp).

The engine was hot, real hot.  I tried to check the oil, but since a lot of it
was dripping out onto the muffler and that dipstick was just short of glowing,
I thought I should let it cool a little while.  After a few minutes (10) I
still had to use a rag to grab the dipstick.  I seemed to have too much oil
still.  Perhaps I put to much in and the excess blew out the top???  Right
about then a couple of people stopped by.  The first wasn't even a VW, just a
guy that thought we might need a Cell Phone to call someone.  We had it
covered so we thanked him and sent him on his way.  Then we had a few more
folks stop by with offers for help.  We had just called the tow truck and were
waiting on them, so there wasn't much to be done.  One of the guys that
stopped by was in a caravan of about 5 VW's from the Woodburn show and offered
up a thought that the oil somehow had expanded after it heated up, thus making
it seem like there was more.  Any thoughts on that?

After a minute or so, the caravan had caught up to this guy I was chatting
with and we had about 5 VW's of various fashion on the side of the road to
check out my situation.  Only with a VW could this happen... Cool.  One of the
caravan-ers seemed to just dive right into my engine and check a few things.
His assessment was that the Oil Cooler wasn't working.  Good thought.  I would
dig into it later the next day.  All in all, we had about 15 VW's and other
passer by's stop and ask if we needed a cell phone, assistance or a ride (I
love Oregon!).

The tow truck came
(http://community.webshots_dot_com/photo/75454343/75455147RZqdkS) and we were
taken home (http://community.webshots_dot_com/photo/75454343/75455091RwDvLI).
Frustrated, dirty, hot and somewhat pissed at the fee for the tow (20 miles...
$160... Grr) I cleaned up and spent the evening resting and got some sleep.
The next day, I dig in.  I pulled the engine myself (not bad for my second
time doing it) and stripped the fan housing off to find the Oil Cooler in the
doghouse (FYI... '74 DP engine).  It was pretty nasty.  The grates were full
of crud, so it could be that the air wasn't flowing through very well.  I
pressure washed it (blocking off the holes first) and it came out pretty good.
I cleaned up everything else I could find while I had it open.  I then went to
put the fan housing (with generator/fan) back onto the engine.  I can get the
driver's side on well
(http://community.webshots_dot_com/photo/75454343/75455106dBpwwB) and the flap
pulley mechanism moves freely.  The passenger side though is an issue.  First
of all, the flap pulley mechanism does not move freely.  It moves, but not
very well.  Something might be blocking it.  Any thoughts on how to seat this
properly?  Here is the picture...

Last question and I will call it quits for this e-mail (thanks for hanging in
there on this one...).  There is a wire to the backside of the flywheel
housing.  I can't tell what it goes to (again... this is a '74 DP engine from
a bug).  Here are some pictures:

What the heck is this?  Do I need it?  How do I wire it?

Thanks in advance for the help.  I appreciate all of it.
