&gt;here is a big ol stinking long link:
&gt;
&gt;http://groups.google_dot_com/groups?q=altitude+corrector&amp;hl=en&amp;group=rec.autos.makers.vw.aircooled&amp;safe=off&amp;rnum=3&amp;selm=g13e4.14569%24s5.166902%40news1.frmt1.sfba.home_dot_com

This can be cut down to just the article ID and still work:

http://groups.google_dot_com/groups?selm=g13e4.14569%24s5.166902%40news1.frmt1.sfba.home_dot_com

The article is by Larry Robinson (Fat Freddy), about a book on Solex 
carburetors, &quot;How to Adjust, Tune, Repair, and Rebuild Solex 2 &amp; 4 Barrel 
Downdraft Carburetors for Maximum Performance Shop Manual&quot;:

LR&gt; Published in 1987.  ISBN number 0-87938-253-8 (soft).
LR&gt; It was first published by Carbooks, Inc. in 1973.  

&gt;this would be a great addition to the
&gt;Obsolete Air-Cooled Documentation Project

Per Amazon it *is* out of print, but I personally would be leery of
scanning something that was in print as late as 1987.  Don't know how
Andrew would feel about it.  Also I'm not sure if 2 or 4 barrel Solexes
were ever used on air-cooled VWs as stock or aftermarket parts.  And
if we did want to scan it, somebody would have to lend us a copy of
the book... :)

The doc project does have a copy of &quot;Solex: Selection and Tuning of the
Carburetor&quot; online at http://wow.atlasta_dot_net/~mriluvu/oacdp/solex.html .

Note that the doc project is now and hopefully permanently located at
http://wow.atlasta_dot_net/~mriluvu/oacdp/docproject.html .  The version
of the site that Thom is hosting for us at
http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/docs/docproject.html is still up, but we
aren't updating it any more.  Also, it doesn't have PDFs or .tar.gz
files for the various manuals - we were trying to be as polite as
possible to Thom's generous donation of space and bandwidth.  :)  
These larger files are hosted at the new location, which will also
be updated whenever we have a new book.

Thanks!

Matt Roberds
