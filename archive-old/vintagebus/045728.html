In a message dated 98-10-21 20:29:35 EDT, you write:

&lt;&lt; If you turn the fan off completely, hot air will rise (via a chimney
 effect) through the electric fans and into the passenger compartment. 
 This air would be _very_ hot and would probably toast the fans.&gt;&gt;
Hi George, 
Good point.  Have many times been startled at how much hot air comes out of
the engine compartment slits when the engine has just been shut off.
 
 &lt;&lt;My preferred method around this is to build a flapper box that will seal
the fans from the exchangers when they are off, and to pass flow from the
engine fan through the exchangers to provide cooling.  This way, the electric
fans won't have to be on all the time.  This is a variation of the system from
a late-model baywindow, with
 recirculation added.  &gt;&gt;
Well the only two problems with this is if you rely on the power of the
electric fans to push closed the flaps against the engine fan they might not
have enough power to do so.  Secondly the reason we prefer the partial
recirculation system is that if there is monoxide leak somewhere in the
heating system.  The new fresh air will help to avoid the monoxode from just
building up to higher and higher levels that a closed circulation system would
cause.  Eric &amp; Barb
