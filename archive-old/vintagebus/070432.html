&gt; Sometimes when i downshift from 3rd to second, if i'm not well below 20 MPH,
&gt; i get a bit of a grinding noise, could this be the shift rod bushings?

Hi John,
Could be that, but sounds more like when we had problems with our 1963 SC 
with shifting into second and would hit reverse instead.  Which turned out to 
be one of the rear shift coupler bolts had been safety wired in such a way to 
promote loosening the bolt!  Have a friend shift your bus while you are 
underneath checking the linkage.
