Hi Ken,
Mostly just like first and second it will have trouble slipping.  Till one 
gets the clutch disc and the FW with the pressure plate at the same RPM and 
even then if accelerated it will break free and slip again in these higher 
gears.  In other words it will drive much like an oil soaked clutch disc, but 
without the shifting grinding gear problem into first, reverse when starting.
