my pops use to let me drive his 98 ch_at_&amp;y 4 door long bed dually when i was 
first beginning to drive.  That was quite a sight when i pulled into the 
McD's drivethru (i didnt get any boogers) and got stuck :)

I ended up totalling the truck a few years ago.  t-boned an s10 doing 55.  It 
hurt. My bus us better anyways.

when i first got the crewcab ford me and the wife made a trip to florida and 
took my trailer and transported her uncles caddy down for him.
well somewhere in south carolina i took a nap and let her drive.
she was doing fine and i was sleeping for a few hours, and she dicided to 
stop and get something to eat so she pulls into a rest area, and pulls up 
next to an older couple who also just pulled in.
well the couple is getting out of there car as she is pulling in to the slot 
next to them.
and they are looking at this thing....full size ford black, black cap, black 
trailer w/black caddy and black tinted windows all around, and then they look 
at my wife jump out     all five foot nothing of her, you had to see their 
faces....classic.
