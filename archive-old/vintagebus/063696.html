Subject: 79 Westy - Cleaning the Fiberglas Top

Hi Folks:

I'm really new to this list and to VW Bus ownership.  This Spring I 
picked up a 78 Westy which had been serving a colleague well for two 
years as a tool shed.   The bus was in surprisingly good shape, runs 
great and has almost no rust.   One problem, the top is pitted and 
faded a dirty streaked gray.  I will be washing it this weekend but 
was wondering if anyone had an idea what to use to re-whiten and 
re-seal it.

Thanks in advance,

BEN
