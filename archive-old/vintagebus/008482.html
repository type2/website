I'd say start talking...... that's basically all you can do..... look around
the Net first, make contacts...... sometimes chances are that if you're not
interested in the one they advertise they might have something else or know
someone that has something you're looking for. Try VW Planet, VintageBus
auctions, Excite Classifieds, eBarf etc, etc. and start sending messages. If
you just go to the show chances are most likely you will come back home
empty handed.

I found my 65 through someone that knew someone who knew a guy that had this
Van in his back yard........ simple.

Good luck!!!

&gt; you never know.   and what &quot;really nice&quot; means to somebody from wisconsin
&gt; is probably not the same as someone from california, or florida, or
&gt; pennsylvania, or.... the problem with what i see in your email are the
&gt; words &quot;early camper&quot;, the dollar amount, and then the driving home part.
&gt; hard to determine mechanical condition from a quick spin around the
parking
&gt; lot (sorry, scott),  and alot of people want early campers, but you really
&gt; never know what will show up.  why not try octo, too, if you're coming
this
&gt; way.  i don't think the classic is exactly the best place to be buying a
&gt; bus anyway, with the inflated pricing going on, but if you've got the time
&gt; and cash to fly out, may not be bad to at least check it out, just be sure
&gt; to get a return flight just in case.   also, as the saying goes, it's not
&gt; what you know, it's WHO you know, and i've often found busses through
&gt; people i just started talking to at shows,
