Subject: Re: [VB]gas heaters, but not J tubes

Eric, I think I can answer some of that question.  Neither of these heaters
rates the cubic feet per minute (CFM) of these heaters.  If you put one next
to the other, the SouthWind will blow almost twice as much air because it
has a dedicated hot air blower.  The Eberspacher's use the upper part of the
fan for hot air and the lower part of the same fan blade for combustion air.
This is one reason the Eberspachers look more streamlined, they only have
one fan for both duties, but deliver much less CFM of hot air than the
SouthWinds.

&gt; It sounds like the SW gas heaters are more efficient than the Ebers are? I
&gt; still have to give the nod to Ebers for looking much more suited in a VW
&gt; engine bay though. Interesting. They seem to compare like this(?):
