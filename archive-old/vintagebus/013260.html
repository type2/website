Subject: Listee in Germany needs BC directions
Message-Id: &lt;199906181215.FAA24285_at_smtp02.primenet_dot_com&gt;

A listee is in Munich on &quot;Holiday&quot; and is apparently clueless as to how he
should get to the Bad Camberg meet. The only thing that I could suggest is
to unfold the map, find &quot;Bad Camberg&quot; and get there. Can anyone provide more
detailed directions, telephone numbers, dates and time of the show(s)?
If was THAT close to the Bad Camberg, I'd think that I'd be on a train by now...
Please pmail further advice to:
