Learn to sew and sew well.  The only way to ensure quality is to build your
own.  I have learned the art of upholstery because my 67 bug needed seats and
I paid and paid for quality only to find their isn't any.  I have redone my
64 bus and people can't believe they are not gennies.  Do it.  You can do far
better than you think.  If, that is, you really want to.  Otherwise.  take
your chances with a convertible top manufacturer.  Or a Boat upholsterer.
