Subject: Re: [VB] Heat riser insulators

I am thinking that you could whip up a batch with this material right here.
At 3 1/2 feet by 4 feet there should be enough there to last awhile. Sell
them to the listees to make your money back. If I didn't have such a backlog
of projects I would do it myself. Should be a cakewalk with a hole saw, they
are just like a washer split in half.

&gt; Anyway, the last post is a really NEEDED question.   Does anyone still
&gt; carry/make/repop the asbestos (or similar substance) heat riser
&gt; insulators that go inside the tin pieces that surround the intake
&gt; manifold heat risers on a SP engine??  I've checked with 3 or 4 local
&gt; VWFLAPS in Southern CA and no one even know what I'm talking about.  One
&gt; guy said the dealer had them, but that was 7 months ago.    What about a
&gt; good substitute that people use if you can't buy the right things??
