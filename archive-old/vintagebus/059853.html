I need some help guys.  I have a 66 with a 1776 in it.  I went to tune =
it up the other day and realized that I did not know where to set the =
timing.  The distributor is an 009.  There were no marks on the pulley =
for adjusting the timing.  My question is where do I set the timing?  =
Should I use TDC, 7.5 BTDC, or some other mark?  It is a manual trans.  =
Also, does it make much difference if I use a strobe light or static =
time it?  Any input would be greatly appreciated.=20
