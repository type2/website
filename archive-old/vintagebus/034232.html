Subject: valve/piston cleaning trick
Date: Tue, 1 Feb 2000 08:03:27 -0800 
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

an old school mechanic taught me a trick many years ago on how to de-carbon
valves and piston tops, he did this religiously to all his tractors and
trucks (he did have a PORSCHE tractor, close to bus context) What he did was
fill a syringe (cow size) with ATF and slowly squirt it down the carb as he
held the RPM's at around 1500, kept it running till all the smoke cleared.

The reason I mention this is that I have done this to older engines that
have sat for years and have brought up the compression after this procedure,
generally due to carbon built up on the valves!
