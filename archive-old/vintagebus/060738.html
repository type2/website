&gt; So I started out at the front shiftrod coupler. I tried to remove the 2 set

Hi Rex,
BTDT!  On our 1960 panel camper conversion.  Took us three hours to 
heat/quench &amp; pry off the forward shift coupler off with plumber wrenches the 
rear shift linkage.  We got from Clara after we cut the nose off a rusted 
beyond belief 1960 panel van she was parting out to get the two pieces out.

 This is the metal coupler up kinda underneath the cab of the truck. I guess 
the 
&gt; best plan now is to drill out the broken set screws. But then, it's real 
&gt; possible the coupler will be welded to the shiftrod pieces by rust!!!

You best bet is to cut the coupler length wise both sides and remove or cut 
it widthwise so you can at least get the shift linkage pieces out of there.  
Remember the shift rods are hollow tubes that are very easy to 
crush!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Only the very ends are filled with solid plugs of steel.

&gt; I'm wondering if any of these parts are available repro. The front shiftrod. 
&gt; The front solid metal shiftrod coupler. The rear long shift rod section.

Shiftrods no!  the forward coupler we think we heard is availible repro, but 
quality sucks.
