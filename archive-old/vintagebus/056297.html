Brosol H30/31 on 1600sp:
Mains 112.5
Idle/Pilot 65
Aux 45
It is working well for me, I get above 20mpg pretty much regardless of
where or how I drive. (except breaking trail through the snow with
chains on a rough dirt road in first and sometimes second gear, that
kills the gas mileage!)  I got my jets from a local bug shop for maybe
$3/each. I would bet Ronnie at Type2Parts and Ron at the Bus Depot both
have them. If you are popping open your carb you might as well treat
yourself to a rebuild kit, maybe $15 or less. Good luck, Joel

Joel,

I agree.  I'm running a new 30/31 and my VW guy who ran in my new motor
for me(lack of time) told me these needed a 127.5 so I said OK. Now with
about 600 miles on it I think it is too rich (smell and only 17mpg on a
totally stock 1600 sp).

What jets would you suggest?  Where do you get them from.

Thanks!

Steve

&gt;Al-
&gt;Congratulations on finally getting that carb issue sorted out. Don't
&gt;knock the Brosol 30/31 too hard, I think you just had bad luck with
&gt;them. I have two, and the only problem I have with them is they come
&gt;with a 120 mains, way too big for a stocker motor. I rejet mine like
&gt;the 1970 30 PICT 3 and am quite pleased with the results. I have a
&gt;feeling that there are a lot of VWs out there running way too rich.

&gt;Replaced the Brosol 30/31 that was routinely drenching my motor with
&gt;gas yesterday. Flipped it upside down for giggles, barely a drop left
&gt;in it.
&gt;A nice crack through the lower body left/right halves created this,
&gt;visible slightly from the back of carb.
&gt;
&gt;The 1970 Pict 30-3 I replaced it with was jetted to stock specs for a
&gt;1600SP from 1970. 112.5 125 air 65 pilot. Sanded down exhaust pipe to
&gt;get silver, and slapped her on. Barely had to tune for idle, very close
&gt;off the bench. Bus ran clean, strong, no hesitation, leaks, good
&gt;pickup,
&gt;better engine temps, better heat (slightly) and a nice grey exhaust
&gt;pipe...Moral of story, KIGS....Keep it German Stupid... I had poor
&gt;luck
&gt;with two brosols, both new to near new, both leaking and running rich
&gt;beyond what the jetting should indicate. Now for the accel bowden
tube
&gt;I
&gt;found and real preheat...
