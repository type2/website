Subject: Round outside mirrors and arms??
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hey folks,
I asked about round mirrors etc a week or so ago and
never got any response, so I am going to pose the
questions again.  At that time there was a discussion
of the mirrors going on and I had some additional
questions.

I am in the market for a passenger side mirror
arm for the round mirror for my 65 double cab, and I
am wondering what the differences are in the repro
arms.  I noticed that at least one supplier has them
in stainless steel, but that might look odd unless I
also replace the driver side arm too.
So, what are the list recommendations for sources of
the arms, and anyone have any hints not already given
for installing them?
Also, has anyone replaced the mirror in one of the
original round mirrors?  I have a couple of them with
broken glass, and I would guess that I could just get
a proper size round mirror cut and glue it in place
with silicone, and use it for daily use, and save my
nice original mirror.  Has anyone done this?  Any
suggestions?
Thanks.
