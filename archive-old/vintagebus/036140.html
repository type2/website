&lt;&lt; Hey all,
 
 Hope you all had a great weekend.  I was just wondering if anyone had a 
 westy jumpseat for a non walktru...the longer 2/3 jump seat.
--------------------
you mean the backwards facing seat?  I think of the jumpseat as the removable 
seat between the backwards facing seat and the icebox- the one you jump over, 
it is a stool in the bay window westys.
======================
 Also wondering 
 what type of seat could be used to have a jumpbench similar looking to a Z 
 bed.  I have a full width rear bench but is designed to lay against the fire 
 wall panel.  Any ideas or info would be appreciated.
 ---------------------------
I am not sure I understand- you mean you want the backwards facing seat to 
fold out into a bed?
 
You can also turn the middle seat around facing backwards for &quot;club seating&quot;
