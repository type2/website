&gt; I'm wondering if any of you might know what this part is. Found it attached to the fuel pump on a 40hp motor. My best guess is a pressure regulator of some sort (but iv never heard of a stock fuel pump having too much pressure)
&gt; 
Looks like a fuel shutoff valve.

Function: Fuel pressure stops, valve closes. 
Purpose: Unknown.
