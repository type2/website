Subject: Offset Q

Hi,

While we're on the topic of offset, I'm also doing my frontend right now.

The config that I just removed looked like this:

33
13

On both sides. According to all the tables I've read, this is not 
correct at all.

Luckily my torsion arms are not bent (at least not for offset).

Does using fewer shims give you better cornering. I would assume that 
fewer on the top would push the bottom of the tire out.

Bus Boys carries shims and other misc. items. I need to get a couple of 
extras (some were chewed up) and a couple of link pin dust caps.

Thanks,
Conrad
