It was a mid year...lets use up all the slash end bumpers and then put on
the rounded end ones kind of thing.  I've never got a definitive answer.  So
if you have a '65 I guess either round end or slash end on the rear is
correct.  Lucky you.

I happen to like the slash end rear (the more expensive ones) so my '65 will
have that type.  If anyone has a definitive date, speak up.  It would solve
a mystery....at least for me.
