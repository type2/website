Subject: new tie rod doesnt fit?
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.10.10006281720100.84220-100000_at_users.anet-stl_dot_com&gt;

hi all,

I just got a new adjustable tie rod from my flaps, correct part number and
everything.

Problem was it was fully 1 inch or perhaps more longer than the adjustable
tie rod that was on my 67 front beam.

Is this a quality control problem, or perhaps is this some wierd thing
where the brazillian baysplits have a similar but not exact part, so they
are sending us that part as an exact replacement when it isnt.

It would have fit, but i would have had no adjustment to make more toe out
as it was all the way screwed in to match my old rod.

anyone else notice this? or was my old rod a mutant?

thanks,

Steve
