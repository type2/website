the project looks greta so far...just one question, why are you using the 12&quot;
square tiles for the floor as opposed to single sheet vinyl. I just installed
single sheet vinyl floor in my bus(replacing the orginal single sheet) I think
there has got to be an advantage of the single sheet. The individual tiles
leave more access points for water or other debris to get under them. With all
the twisting and flexing of the bus, I woul think that the tiles are much more
likely to pop up.

I guess on the plus side, it is probably real easy to fix.
