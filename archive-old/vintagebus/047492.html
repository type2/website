&gt; The heat blower sounds great.  
&gt;  
&gt;  But-   yes the heat exchangers do function to cool the exhaust and thus 
the 
&gt;  heads, and the engine will run hotter w/o air bowing through here.  And 
you 
&gt;  likely wont turn the heat on in the hot days in summre? 

I had exactly the planed set up on my '73 before I scraped it (rear torsion 
bar tube separated from the chassis) - i.e. a 1600 twin port, air outlets on 
fanshroud blocked off, a Type 4 engine auxiliary blower recycling interior 
air through the heat exchangers.

I agree that air moving through the heat exchangers will assist in cooling 
the exhaust and therefore the engine, but the loss of this air seamed to be 
offset by the greater amount of air flowing over the cylinder heads and I saw 
no change in the temperature as reported by a dipstick oil temperature sender 
(yes I agree a cylinder head temp gauge would have been better).

About use in the summer if the heat exchanger flaps are closed and the fan is 
turned on then you are dumping interior air through the heat exchangers so 
you take advantage of exhaust cooling and at the same time help to keep the 
interior cool â€” especially important on a Kombi based camper (rather than 
minibus based) as, unless they have been changed, there are no opening 
windows in the back.

Good luck
