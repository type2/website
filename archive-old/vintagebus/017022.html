Subject: Oklahoma Listees???
To: &lt;vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

Are there any listees out there near Claremore, OK that would be willing to go look at an item I'm thinking of buying?  Also, if the item is what I'm looking for, I might need it taken apart and shipped...the seller is an older gentleman who does not seem very interested in taking the item to his local UPS office...

Thanks for any help!!

Katie
