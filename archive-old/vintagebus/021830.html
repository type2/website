Hi list,

Thanks to all those that responded to my clunking transnission question.
Turned out to be the left side RG box loose on the spring plate. I had
tightened both boxes to the plates but without the correct torque specs I
erred in the side of caution when it came to winding them up.

I was surprised to see how loose they were when I began to tourque them up
in 10ft/lb increments and I was waiting for one of the 40 year old bolt
heads to shear off at any moment.

Now for the Q. The left box only stopped moving when I got the torque up to
the 95ft/lb mark which is a little over the max specced. Can anyone tell
tell me why the one needed 95 and the other settled down nicely at 75.

TIA 

Michael ('60 Dcab)
