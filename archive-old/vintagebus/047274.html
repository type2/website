hey there---
I totally agree. I'm only 18 years old and was brought up (am still)in a &quot;ten 
minute oil change&quot; household. Until I was 16 and got my Bug, I wouldn't of 
been able to tell you anything about cars. All of the sudden, I was content 
with learning about cars starting with a good old aircooled oil change. I've 
come a long way in knowledge after I bought my 59' panel. I still need to 
learn alot more, but am on the right road.
These cars almost yell at you out loud and say &quot;get interested and get to 
know me!&quot;

Nowadays, my dad, who isn't much of a car guy, will read the list posts and 
get very interested in my busses restoration. He even goes to the junkyard 
with me to get parts for fun sometimes:)

I still love it when they come home from work and i'm in the garage. They 
always ask, are you sure you can do that! Even for minor things like oil 
changes:)

I love the fact that we know what is in our cars and how it works. This list 
has given me info I could get nowhere else! Not to mention, a great group of 
people to discuss  info with! 
---My generation is definately afraid of getting dirty!

Sorry for rambling, maybe this shouldve been a friday post

Thanks--
Pete
