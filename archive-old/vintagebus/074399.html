&gt; a) it seems like I have to remove weld/drill&amp;screw-out the plug on the 
&gt; inner RGB half in order to remove it: is this the case or can i pull the RGB and 
&gt; disassemble on the bench?

Hi Tom,
The only way to remove the RGB from the tranny center section without 
destroying parts is to remove engine, remove tranny and then dissassemble the RGBs.

&gt;   b) sounds like i may or may not need a bearing puller: is there a size I 
&gt; should shoot for in renting one, or...

Just wait till you get in there and find out if you really need a puller.  We 
have been able to remove the bearings with common hand tools without speacial 
pullers.

&gt; I'm planning on rebuilding both RGBs at once, although I have a source for 
&gt; two used RGBs which I might just pick up and pop on if it's easier, while 
&gt; waiting until I have time to rebuild mine.  Thoughts on this?

Go ahead and get them for spare parts.  RGBs are most likely the next spare 
parts that are going to dry up for our buses.

&gt; I do have the Bentley's, but I confess, most of the scanning I did of the 
&gt; rebuild process has already slipped through my brain.

Do not try to memorize the proceedures in Bentley, just take it one step at a 
time.

&gt; I've been hemming and hawing on doing this because of time issues and the 
&gt; fact that I have a running bus right now, but I'm getting to the point where 
&gt; I'm ready to do it and I want to get an idea of what I'm getting into before 
&gt; I go for it. 

Just do it and install all new ball bearings.  If any of the old ball 
bearings are in good shape you can use them as spares.  That way if you do it now and 
correctly you will not have to do it again for 100,000+ miles of reliable 
driving.  The only RGB bearings we will actually reuse is the lower outer roller 
bearings if they inspect as good and they are real easy to inspect.
