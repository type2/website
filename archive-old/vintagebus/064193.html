Subject: Re: [VB]  Without Guesswork

[...]

Has everyone forgotten this site?
http://wow.atlasta_dot_net/~mriluvu/oacdp/
The 1969 Without Guesswork book is there. Says it covers from Dec 1953 through
Aug 1968.
If the 1961 issue has more/different info, maybe it can be added to the above
site?

&gt; &gt; P.S. I have scanned VW Service without guesswork mechanics pocket book
&gt; dated Jan/61. It has alot of specs on VW passanger cars, transporters and
&gt; industrial engines. The total file size of the scanned book is 3.16 megs so
&gt; I can't e mail the whole thing but if you are interested in certian specs
&gt; out of it just let me know and I will e mail the pages to you.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Bob also gave me a CD so it's on my site:
&gt; http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/archives/manuals/61guesswork.mv
&gt;
&gt; I could put a ZIP file on there too if that would be easier...
