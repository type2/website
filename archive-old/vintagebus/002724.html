Probably a Friday post, but it's close enough for me...

An artist named &quot;Money Mark&quot; has a video in which a green splitty is driving
around in circles.  I saw it in a Hecht's Department store teeny-boppers
section where they play videos on TVs suspended from the ceilings.  I guess
the purpose is to show that a large department store can be as hip as all
those Gap and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch-like stores
