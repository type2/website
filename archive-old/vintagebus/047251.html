To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hi Andrew,
Best to slightly bend outward each exhaust tube that attaches to the rear of 
the heads.  A piece of pipe or such other works well.  Then install the 
muffler and carefully tighten the mounting nuts.  If the nuts get too tight 
due to tilted exhaust flanges just use a hammer and punch to help straighten 
out the flanges.  To attach the heat risers of the intake manifold loosen the 
muffler and bend/pry the heat riser till you have all the threaded mounting 
fasteners in place but do not tighten any of them till everything is in 
place.   Eric&amp;Barb
