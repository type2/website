Many thanks to all the Listees who made the photos being posted possible.  
It isn't the same as being there but it helps soothe not going... someday to

meet you folks.  Did Rachel make it down?  I got a little concerned when she

lost her travel partner.

NQ, a special thanks for everything.  Looking forward to Sundays posts... 
next year ?
