Subject: Thank you Howard for the advice!! 

Well it has happened, or at least it has started.  Maybe a couple years
ago, Howard from the MoKan VW club in Kansas City, suggested that I just
pick out one bus and do it.  So yesterday (Monday), dad who is a young 75,
helped me strip the interior out of a Turquoise and white '66 hard top
deluxe and load it on a trailer.   Then at about 7pm last evening, my good
friend Chad from Ponca City and George who will do the work, hooked onto
the trailer with George's truck and headed for Oklahoma.

George who is a good VW friend from OK city, and a great body and paint man
is going to do the outside, engine compartment and dash in original single
stage style and paint color.  He will also paint the window frames the same
color as the roof.  The bus is pretty straight for a 34 year old vehicle,
but there are a few dings, a touch of rust here and there and maybe a crack
or two to weld up.  George repairs metal with metal, so there will be very
little bondo.  It doesn't look as if the bus has had any previous repairs,
but we will soon find out.

Chad found this bus in a field close to where he lives in Ponca City.
After much coaxing (I don't think Chad thought I needed any more busses and
this one would just get added to the fleet), Chad let me buy the bus.

I have wanted for a long while a really nice looking split to daily drive
(at least in nice weather).  But on a teacher income, is has been a bit
difficult dream to realize.  I am going to sell a few busses to fund the
project, but I need to thin out the barn a bit anyway.

The work will be done in Chad's garage, so I am sure Chad will be keeping a
close eye on it and maybe even posting a few messages about it on the
splitty list.  I wish the work was being done a little closer to home, so I
could drop in on it once and a while, but maybe it's better this way
(George did promise to take plenty of pictures).  I wish that I could do
the work, but if I am going to get a bus done, being a mostly full time dad
of a two year old, this is the only way.

When I get the bus back, I will still need to restore the interior, replace
the panels (they are really bad), do the upholstery, headliner, and
pedestal covers and maybe even spray some paint in the cargo area.  I wish
I could have done this first, but as George is ready to work now, I will
have to get the outside done first.  As George is on a break from his full
time job at a Oklahoma City body shop, be will be working on my bus 40
hours a week, so long as Chad isn't out there bugging him!!

I can't believe it, after all these years, I am finally going to have a
really nice looking bus to drive!!
