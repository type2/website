Hi NQ,
Do not get those.  They do not put out the heat during the winter, and cause 
the engine to run hotter during the summer.  All due to not having internal 
fins inside of them to extract more heat out from the exaust.  Matter of fact 
the J-tube in these heaters are DEC62-AUG63 only and VW got rid of them due 
to this problem and went to the internal finned AUG64 and later heater boxes 
with larger exaust snouts.  You would be better to take a pair of stocker 
apart and weld the right sized tubing to the exhaust ends to rebuild them.
