So your side's are the SILVER stuff??? NOT the tan stuff?  Wierd.  none of
the above, then.;)

NONE of that is mesh grey, which I have a bit of sitting here in my hand
from my 66...it is more of a green/grey. Dark.


So you are saying that the silvery reflective stuff are your side's???
And the  tan looking stuff are your tops? ???  I would VERY much suspect
that all your covers have perhaps been rreplaced...those look, in that
combination, nothing like any of the above...


anyone else have any views here??
