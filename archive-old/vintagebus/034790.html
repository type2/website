 &lt;&lt; I was wondering if anyone new where I could find a 66 or 67 splash pan 
for 
 a
  friends bus. I found one in a junk yard in vegas for my bus but I dont have
  any leads on finding another one. Does anyone have one they would like to
  part with.

 I see a lot of messages about splash pans.  Were they installed on 71 
busses? 
  Mine doesn't have one and I don't even know what one looks like.  I have 
 never seen them advertised by the sheetmetal sellers.  That could be part of 
 my heating problem.

yes they were put on bay windows.,   but are a different shape.  We are 
talking about the under cab pan right?     I think I have one.  It makes some 
difference in heat, a bit less drafts from the floor around pedals, but not 
huge.  How are your drafts around the doors?   Replacing cab door seals -0 
even though I used used ones, made much more differnce in cutting down drafts 
than installing the under cab pan (this one my 65)   Putting a good engine 
compartment seal in also improves your heating
