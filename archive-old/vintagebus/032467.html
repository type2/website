My friend just lowered his 29 Model A 13 inches!!!!!
Plus converted it to RHD!
I dont think the Judges would go for the 20&quot; X 5&quot; rust hole in the side of 
the doors!!!

&lt;&lt;As far as functionality goes, it doesn't make any difference at all.

However, in some vintage circles it makes a world of difference.  Check
out the judging at a Ford model A or T show.  Vehicles get downgraded for
having the wrong sort of plating on transmission bolts, for example.

I say, drive 'e,m!
