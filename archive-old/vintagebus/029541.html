Subject: Subhatch remounting.

Hi All.

I just finished repairing the water damaged center section of my
Sub-hatch in my '61 Westy.  When I pulled the hatch off, I had to remove
the 4 cap nuts on the inside along with a couple large washers, rubber
washers, and more smaller washers (I removed my roof panels also).  When
I lifted up the hatch from the roof, there was sylicone sealant, rubber
washers, and metal washers.  I'm getting set to put all of this back
together and thought I should ask as to what should be there holding the
hatch snug.

Also, the aluminum rim around the opening had a bunch of sticky gunk
holding it to the rail in the roof.  Should there be anything in there
holding the aluminum rim to the opening lip?  If so what have you guys
used.

Thanks,
Aaron
'61 Westy with less leaks.
