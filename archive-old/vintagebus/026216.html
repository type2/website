Hi Dave.
I've rebuilt 2 sets of engine room decklid hinges.  I use 11/64 rod, an
11/64 bit, a center punch, and some patience.  Drill out the outside
piece first, 1 side at a time.  Then vise grip the pieces together as
straight as can be, and use the outside as a guide to drill the inner
piece.  I cut the rod to length, drill a small hole (3/32) in each end
of the pin.  Grease the hell out of the pin and holes.  Insert the pin.
Setting the assembly on it's side, take the center punch in the small
holes you drilled and smack it good and hard with a BF.  This'll expand
the ends of the pin so it doesn't come back out.
Dave
