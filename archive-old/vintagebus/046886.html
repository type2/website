Hi West,
We would have to dissagree with that.  More iron shavings than steel come
&gt;from the cylinders and piston rings.  The problem is that the iron shavings
act just like steel shavings when a maganet is applied so volks just assume
that they are all steel.  As for the steel only shavings it would probably be
an equal amount from the oil pump and crank journals.
   If you ever try running a new engine 10,000 miles and then stripping it to
the short block replacing the connecting rod bearings and then running it
another 10,000 miles with full flow filter there is a huge differance in just
the bearing surfaces.  The first ones look like a blizzard of small
particules passed on through and left thier marks on the bearings faces.  The
second set of bearings with full flow filter just end up slightly polished
with no grooves from particules passing through.
