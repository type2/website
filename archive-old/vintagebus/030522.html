Subject: CA license plate issue, AB2058

Hi all,

I'm trying to get my 71 registered, but they want to take my blue and
yellow plates.  I would like to keep them on the car as they look cooler
and that's what the car came with.  The problem is that with the car out
of the books the DMV says I can't keep them.  Looking through the
archives, I find that there was a bill (AB2058) which would have opened
up the ability to register a car prior to '74 with YOM plates, which
seemed to have been vetoed by the governor.  Is this true?  Even though
I have proof (old registration slips from the PO) can they take my
plates, or do I just need to find a different DMV person who really
wants to help me.

Also is there an archive for the bay window list, as that might have
more relevant information for me and I'm not on that list, as I've also
got a '59 and 61 splitty.

Thanks, and happy rainy Friday here from San Diego.
Aaron
