Subject: Stuck rear drum!
Message-ID: &lt;37FF9973.C9E5C099_at_earthlink_dot_net&gt;

I'm too tired to look in the archives tonight.  I will tomorrow.  But in
the short term, can anyone give me the hot tip to getting a rear drum
unstuck from the stub axle??  I've tried liquid wrench type stuff,
heat/water/heat cycles, tapping &amp; pounding, and using a mondo US made
two arm puller my old mechanic neighbor has.

Not even a budge!   Yes I backed the adjusters off all the way.  The
drum spins freely.  Is there anything I'm missing???


Help.


Thanks.

Steve
