I will be kicking myself for sure for selling her but there is more work
than I am capable of.  I found another bus that has very little work that
needs to be done to it and I can't afford to have and do both.  I am asking
1,000.00 for it and if you have any other questions about it please do it
privately. Front lights are there but the back lights are missing.  I was
going to put it on ebay but wanted the list to get first dibs on it. Thanks

Rob
