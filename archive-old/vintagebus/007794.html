Stewart,

The only 2 things I can think of are to take down the garage door and
install a roll up or put a lot of weight in the bus to push it down on
the suspension.

Subject: [VB] Fitting my bus in my garage


&gt; Long time lurker, first time poster!!
&gt;
&gt; I have recently moved from an apartment to a house with a garage.  I
&gt; finally have a place to work on my '60 Kombi.  There is only one
&gt; problem, my garage with garage door hardware seems to only have
&gt; approx. 6' of clearance while my bus measures out at about approx.
6'
&gt; 1&quot;.  I was wondering if any one has ideas/suggestions for getting my
&gt; bus into the garage so I can get to work on it.
&gt;
&gt; I believe that pulling the wheels off and dropping it onto some type
&gt; of wheeled aparatus would be the way to go, since I plan to do some
&gt; major work on the bus (body and engine).
&gt;
&gt; I have seen small metal dollies with casters on them but no idea
where
&gt; to buy them ( I am in Vancouver B.C). Are these any good.  The ones
&gt; that I have seen on the web are expensive.  Is it possible to build
a
&gt; set of dollies from wooden timbers and caster wheels.  Or has anyone
&gt; made any of these dollies from metal, and how have they worked.
&gt;
&gt; No, I don't want to just let the air out of the tires!
&gt;
&gt; Hoping to pick the lists collective brain.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
&gt;
&gt; Stew
