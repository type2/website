I have the same philosophy.  I bought a 1 inch breaker bar but now I'm
having trouble finding sockets.  I found one place that had sockets but
a 36mm was $28!  That's more than I paid for the breaker bar (used).  Anyone
know of a place to buy 1 inch sockets?

I normally keep my tongue in discussions like this, but what the heck...

If you're breaking tools, you're doing something wrong!

Yes, Sears will unconditionally replace tools, but you still pay for them.
the next tool you buy will cost more to cover the warrenty.

It is much more economical, ethical, and much less frustrating to buy the
correct tool in the first place.  Sure, the 1/2 inch drive 36mm socket is
cheaper, but after you factor in a couple of trips back to the store to
get new breaker bars to replace the ones you broke, you might as well have
popped for the 3/4 drive tools.  The chance of injury from breaking tools
is enough to convince me to get the good stuff first.
