&gt;I just let everett do the hunting for me.
I go to bidder search, type in everett, and snipe whatever he bids on.
&gt;
Heh-heh, that only gets you the crap I don't really care about...

Now if you tapped into my streaming eBay feed that send all VW item photos
and descriptions to my archives and all VW item text through my search
filters, that would be something.  ;)

Bus content:
I put a NOS screw-terminal oil pressure switch in my Bus and now the light
comes on after driving on the freeway for a while.  The oil is fresh, Bus
just tuned and valves adjusted, dipstick is actually cool (for once), drives
normally.  Weird, I think I got a bum switch...

Later,
Everett Barnes
