Subject: Re: [VB] Road music or not

Reminds me of my last trip to  the LA area 
---------------- Clip -----------------------
Question of the day.
Genuine bus content.
I've been to Mexico, Costa Rica and a few other lands where Spanish is
the predominate language (Like LA).
The predominant vehicle is VWs and 15 year old US Detroit iron.
Why don't we see more Hispanics driving Combi and VWs?
Is it because they know something that we don't?
Busses would carry great THUMP speakers and be cool low riders.
