Another consideration:  I saw a sheet from a well-known trans rebuilder that
showed anything geared higher than a 4.12 with an .89 needs extensive oil 
cooling
capabilities.  This makes sense considering that the fan no longer turns as 
fast.

No affiliation, yada yada yada.

funny thing I have noticed is that people who are not used  to driving an old 
VW tend to shift up much too soon.  Cause they can hear the engine (duh)   .  
Which means the fan is going much too slow to cool the (luggging) motor.    
which is why (I think) vw says to keep the rpms up.   

  Actually with the speeds many people would like to drive on todays roads, 
the rpms are way higher than lugging in an old VW bus, and the fan may be 
turning faster, but it is well above the optimal cooling rpms (which is about 
2600 to 3K) and changing the gearing higher   will drop the rpms to a better 
cooling level and actually the engine will run cooling without any changing 
to the oil cooling system. 

Not to say oil cooling is bad.   I changed from a regular dog hous to a type 
IV doghouse to getting better cooling (it worked).
