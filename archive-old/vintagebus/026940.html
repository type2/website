Subject: more brakes- springs/ hoses/61 update
To: Claralw_at_aol_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I felt something odd still in the rear brakes. even after replacing the 
hoses.  The left rear drum became slightly warm, and when I tried to readjust 
it, it seemed to be odd. When I stmped on the brake pedal, pulled the ebrake 
handle to 'reset' the shoes, the brakes would rub slightly.  hm.   I wondered 
it the brake cable was sticking, as I had put the stuff in the wheel 
together, new hose, etc.  So I removed the wheel and drum * again *.  Pulled 
the shoes off.   The spring was thrashed.  But it had been good when I had 
installed it, about 35 miles ago.  The bad hose keeping the pressure on and 
getting it hot must have toasted it.  Stretched out very visibly , and bent, 
not springing shoes together.  So I replaced the spring, and lubed the brake 
cable anyway.   I prefer the old school grease fitting ones, sigh.  There 
were slight marks on the brand new drum from pulsing brakes  :(  from not 
many miles of driving- 35 or so.  Now stomping the pedal helps reset the 
shoes, and does not cause the brakes to rub.  :)
