OK, I'll jump in...

'56 Standard Microbus, hasn't run in years, rotting from the ground up, not
much left of the frame.
sometimes I sit behind the wheel and make engine noises, imagining that I'm
heading out from Phoenix to somewhere in the Pacific Northwest, last time I
drove it was when I rolled it off the trailer into my buddies warehouse so
my wife wouldn't find out about it.

'60 Standard Mcrbs (shortened microbus), bought it from an eccentric former
owner of a tour bus company (you may remember the posts), he wanted &quot;3&quot; for
it and I fretted for days before I got the nerve to ask him &quot;3 what&quot; turns
out it was 3 hundred. Hasn't run since the '70's best thing about it is that
it's short enough to hide in the warehouse behind the '56 so if my wife does
find the bus mentioned above, she won't see this one.

'66 SO-42 Westfalia  I'm the 3rd owner, she's intact and original, has side
tent and roof rack, currently needs transmission (pops out of 4th).
Otherwise in pretty good shape, 109,000 miles. I start her and drive her
around the block or so each Saturday unless the weather is impossibly
heinous.
Northern Illinois buses don't expect much more than that from December
through March.

&gt; soon.
