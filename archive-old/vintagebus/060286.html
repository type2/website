Hello Ronnie

	VW shops in the area for tomorrow's drive.
Fred's Imports in Santa Maria an hour north of Santa Barbara.
Joes Buggy Haus in Grover Beach an hour and a half north. I don't have
Joe's Buggy Hause's number off hand but they are both in the 805 Area
Code and Dan at Fred's (805 925 6121)is a great guy if he has the parts
he will sell them to you a fair price. Just tell him that Eric sent you
and if he doesn't have the parts there are a couple of other places
close by like Erick's imports a couple blocks over that might have the
parts as well.. 


I hope this gets to them in time. I will try the Cell tomorrow and see
if I can help I might have a couple but I will be in Lompoc by 8:00am
tomorrow I will see what they want to do.

   Dan Kinsey just called and is going through Ventura on 101 north. He
broke another wavey washer on his engine, got it fixed and is looking
for a
VW shop somewhere between Ventura and Paso Robles to try and find some
solid
rocker shafts and/or ratio rockers to install. If anybody can help him
out
his cell number is 321  795  5003
