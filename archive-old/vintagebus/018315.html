I am just happy to finally have gates on my single.I woul guess that the
stack height of the two shorter bumpers add up to the height of the longer
bumper.

And another one along the same lines...of what use is the forward bumper on 
a singlecab side gate?  There is only a bumper on the body to meet up with 
the *rear* bumper on the gate...

&gt;the non-DeLuxe buses equipped with BOTH rubber bumpers AND check straps???
