I finally posted some info on Busses by the Sea at http://vw.illequipped_dot_com
Space is filling up fast at the campsites, so if you havent reserved a space
dont hesitate.  To everyone whos sent me a confirmation I will be sending
out more info shortly to all of you.
Please email me if there is anything you think i should address on the site.

vw.illequipped_dot_com news---
The site is starting to shape up nicely, I have about an hours work left on
the classifieds section and another hour or so on the links page.
Something new for the day is the Events section.  Please post all of you
event there if you have any.  I'm beta testing this and would love some
feedback.  All previous page errors should be fixed.
Also, post a pic of your VW if you havent allready and play the Feature Free
For All game.  Ive noticed the feature image changing often so i guess its
working fine.  If anyone has any suggestions or would like me to add
something to the site please email me.

Thanks
Emmet
