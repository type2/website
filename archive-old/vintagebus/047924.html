&lt;&lt; the driver's side front door of my '67 was rubbing at the bottom.  There 
 is a specific spot (about 2&quot; wide) that was getting enough wear to cause it 
 to become indented.  Is there a way to adjust the door height/angle? &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;

I had a door with this problem, pins seemed good. no rust where the hinges 
attached to the door. I ended up removing the hinge half from the body and 
the door, putting it in a vise and whacking it with a hammer to bend it a 
bit. Bent it forward enough to  lift the door and keep it from draging.
