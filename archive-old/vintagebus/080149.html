Subject: [VB] Re: poor gas mileage

I think that all Bob Donalds Type-1 rebuild have CRsless than 7.0.
Bob also may suggest the 10* btdc as a starting point but might say its
ok to advance a bit more if you were to ask him.

I get 21/24mpg with a 30/31 pict, 009 &amp; a single port engine of unkown 
specs and history on my 64 with big nut tranny &amp; 14&quot; wheels.

MPG;s are becoming a bit more important with higher fool fuel $.  I have 
been using 87 octane.  I am pretty sure Bob's rebuilds are done with the 
ability to use low octance gas in mine, but again he tell you the right 
thing.

Rocco,
     What's the compression ratio in your new rebuilt engine?  Motors 
with CRs less than 7-1 get slightly less miles per gallon.  The advice 
to time the thing at 10* btdc makes me think that it has low cr.  Try 
increasing the advance a tad and see if that helps.  Works for me with a 
6.6-1 cr 1600 sp....   Gary Gibson
