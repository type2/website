&gt; First a correction - our bus is 60 mph at 3500

&gt; Example 6 matches our RPM and speed with correction for tire size but this is
&gt; not what we thought we had.  We thought we should have had the post-63 swing
&gt; axle gearing, like example 5.

Something you may be overlooking is the error in your speedometer, owing
to the circumference of your tires, or a weakened speedometer spring....

VW speedo's are not known for their accuracy to begin with, a 3mph
difference is very easily unnoticable.

good luck.
