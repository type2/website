It involved drilling out the air correction jet and the pump shot
nozzle.  I'm not sure on the details.

&gt;I also heard that you can cure the 34/3 009 stumble by filling in the hole
on the throttle butterfly with a pop rivet or something else.  Personally, I
just use the 30pict on whatever I'm driving.
