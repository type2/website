&gt;Bet you'll find that your flasher relay runs *really* fast - more like
&gt;a door buzzer than a blinker.

Actually, under reduced load, most common flasher relays run slower.
If the load is light enough the bulbs won't blink at all.

I've got a 1994 catalog from Wagner of automotive miniature lamps and
flashers.  They list no less than 6 different types of automotive
flashers:

Thermal
  Fixed Load
  Variable Load
  Combination

Electro-mechanical
  Variable load
  Combination

Solid-state
  Variable load

From the application list, fixed-load flashers are generally used 
for turn signals and variable-load flashers are generally used for
hazard warning.  Combination types are used for either/both
application.

As far as load dependency, there is a note that the fixed load types
are more sensitive to changes in load.  The fixed-load types in
the catalog are rated for (exactly) 2 or 3 lamps at a certain
candlepower each.  The variable load types are rated with a range
of lamps like 1 to 4 or 1 to 10.  The combination types are rated
with separate turn and hazard bulb ratings, like 2 turn, 6 hazard.

The electro-mechanical and solid state 12v flashers are rated
for 9 to 16 v with little to no change in the rate or percent
on time.  They don't list any 6v flashers of this type...just
thermal ones.

&gt;The correct solution will involve the LEDs, and also coming up with
&gt;some sort of replacement for the flasher relay that doesn't care how
&gt;much current is being drawn through it.

It's a kludge, but you could add in some power resistors to match
the draw of the incandescent bulbs.  However, this kind of puts
you back at the same problem as far as having a voltage drop at
the tail-lights.

&gt;Otherwise we have to mess around with voltage dividers or 
&gt;other things that aren't well-suited to the harsh vehicular
&gt;environment.

I think something like a 7806 linear voltage regulator would
survive just fine in a car.  This is what many people replace
the fuel gauge &quot;vibrator&quot; on Type 1s with.  I know I've seen
something on one of the VW web sites about how to use these
to run 6V accessories (like an original radio) in a car you've
converted to 12v.

&gt;Since I'm planning on doing some conversion along these lines before
&gt;the end of the year, I'll definitely be putting more thought into all
&gt;this.

Euro tail lights, with the separate turn-signal bulb?  This has
probably been discussed before, but all you really need to do is
disconnect the wire between the brake light switch and the turn
signal switch, and run one new wire from the brake light switch
back to the back.  This gives you three wires at the back -
brake, left turn, right turn.

I hope this helps!!
