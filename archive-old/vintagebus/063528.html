Subject: Various CLub Stickers

Hey Y'all,
I have got a wall in my garageworkshop that I have started putting VW stickers
on. As I put on a &quot;Save The Bays&quot; sticker yesterday (thanks Mike Visket!) I
thought it would be cool to try to cover this entire wall with various VW Club
sticker. So if you have a club sticker, or a web site sticker relating to VW's
I WANT ONE! Drop me a pmail and I will pay you for the shipping and sticker. I
would love to get stickers from each of the 50 states and even foreign
countries, such as WEST VIRGINIA (just kidding, Nemo, I couldn't resist!) So
talk to me and send me a sticker!

Peace, John Baker
