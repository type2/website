&lt;&lt; Is there anywhere or anyone that can give me specific measurements,

Hi Mike,
Bentley has the technical info.  Best test of course is to drive it with 
approximately the normal load in it (Including passengers!) on very dark 
roads.  Low beam should put out a line running left to right of brightness 
about 20-40 feet ahead on the pavement.  Then turning to brights the beam 
should run parallel to a flat road surface, not high up in the trees like you 
were only looking for low UFOs!  Eric&amp;Barb
