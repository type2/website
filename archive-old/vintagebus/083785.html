Subject: Questions about aftermarket stuff

Has anyone bought the safari window kit from ISP products?
Has anyone bought an aftermarket headlight conversion to H4?
Ever get in trouble with the law for them not being dot approved for highway use?

I know Izzy's safari's are the best, just have heard different opinions about them, any more input?
 
Thanks for you time.
Eric
