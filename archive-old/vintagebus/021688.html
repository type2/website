See, heres the thing.
They did make them that early.
They came up with the concept in 1954.
(PLEASE correct me if Im wrong, but I could have sworn that Ive seen a 
brochure with ACTUAL photos of a barndoor binz)
Its NOT a VW factory deal.
Coachbuilt.
I mean someone basically hacked up a new singlecab pickup and grafted their 
parts to make it into a doublecab.
Is that different in ANY way from what Im suggesting?
Im all for saving original busses, but if its BEYOND the point of saving?
There is a point where the frame gives way an the roof starts to kink.

I mean this ISNT a RHD barndoor deluxe or anything.

Im not trying to stirr up controversy, Im not a hack (not that bad atleast).
Just looking for input or words of advice.

&lt;&lt;Are you considering buying the ebay DC and then cutting out the cab and
then grafting it onto another pick up?  Or are we simply talking about a
total custom fabrication with lots of sheet metal mods here?

&gt; Alright, now Im sure ALOT of you guys have seen the binz double cab 
&gt; advertised on ebay.
&gt; I was curious what it would take to do the conversion on another singlecab 

&lt;/XMP&gt;&gt;&gt;
