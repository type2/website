Hey everybody:

I recently located some new door hinges for my 57.  I am now looking for the 
hardware needed to attach them to my doors.

According to the Bentley book, The original rivets need to be drilled out 
and special 8mm screws and nuts are used to replace them.

Here is the picture right out of the book:

I can't seem to find these parts. Has anyone else ever done this before? 
Anyone know who sells this hardware?

The VW part number for the screw is N 10 997 1. The nuts and washers are 
just normal 8mm pieces. I don't see this listed in any current parts book.

Thanks,
Skid

P.S. Please email me directly with any answers. Thanks.
