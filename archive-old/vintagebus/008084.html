Subject: Discontinuation of the VW Ads site.

I've been having some off list discussions with Kevin Ahlgrim and it
appears, according to him, that some of you think I'm full of myself and
that I'm looking for glory and praise.  Here's an excerpt of his message:
==========================
....but to me it looks like you are looking for some kind of glory because
of what you
are doing. (Regarding posting the ads)

  I like working hard in the background, I don't need the
spotlight. I've read the emails and have had a few come to me without
going through the list that agree with my thoughts but say they have
met you and that you are a good guy.  As one person said to me, I
should just drop it because he's sure you're enjoying (ego) &quot;The NQ
Fest&quot;.
==============
So evidently, my wanting to know if someone got a VW from the ads I post Is
deemed glory-seeking.  The only reason I wanted to know is because if I saw
that the time I spent compiling the ads was generating results for people,
then that would give me added incentive to keep doing it.  It takes a good
hunk of time for me to do this.  If nobody read the ads, then what would be
the point to continue doing it?  If I wanted glory for it, I would have told
people to sing my praises on the list for doing it.  I'm baffled and floored
that I've been attributed of having bad motives.

The last line is the killer though.  I do have friends on the list and it's
very kind of them to come forward in my defense but I don't sit here and
revel in any supposed glory.  Actually the messages are OTP's such as this
one basically is and have no place on the list.  Then again, Kevin's
original message was an OTP as well.

I've viewed my ads site as a way to share the treasures with everyone
without revealing my source.  Don't any of you in the past remember the few
people who opened their mouths about a bus for sale, or a gold mine of VWs
sitting around, etc. only to find that someone slipped in behind them and
got the &quot;stash?&quot;  We've all heard those stories and it's with this frame of
mind that I won't reveal the source of the ads.  I've actually thought that
it made more sense to post my ads to a website than to continually post them
direct to the list.  That way the list wouldn't be cluttered with it and
those that didn't care about it could just hit the big red delete button and
move on.

I never dreamed that in the short time I've been posting these ads that it
would generate such negativity.  Geesh.

It's with this frame of mind that I'm going to stop compiling the ads.  No,
I'm not pouting nor retreating into a corner but I want to proove that I'm
NOT a glory seeker.  For crying out loud people, this is just an internet
listserv.  I've got a life and the last thing I care about is whether I'm in
the spotlight or not.  I only wanted to pass along the good info.

I know I'm a bad boy for posting this but I felt that I needed to offer an
explanation to the list why I'm discontinuing posting the ads.

Okay, so I'm moving on from this point forward.  Now that I know where I
&quot;stand,&quot; I'll be a little bit more reserved and think twice before speaking.
I really do apologize if I appeared to be a glory chaser and  I'll be
watching what I say from this point on.
