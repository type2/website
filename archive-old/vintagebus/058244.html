Subject: FW: [VB] Re: [T2] so we got in the red vw microbus, and headed to
	ward the police officer station!

Hey all, I drive my bus daily with YOM plates and no stickers.
I've been pulled over once for a tailight being out.
That was the only time in 5 years of bus driving.
I do get the typical sterotype BS from people I work with though.
