O.K. WTF is happening?  Has the planet started rotating in reverse?  Are
the poles changing their polarity?  Whos next...WCM...Wolfsburg West? 
Does this mean I have to buy EVERYTHING I need for my resto NOW?  When
did people know about the sell out....am I the last to hear?

Yea...yea...I know... shut the hell up and quit whining!  I guess I just
can't stand the idea of seeing F'ing REPO racks going for insane prices
at the next swap.  Guess it's not always smart to wait...huh?

Steve
