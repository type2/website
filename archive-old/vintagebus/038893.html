I've been happy with my Kymco box. 2 years and 20K something miles, no problems,
The bonus was they didn't bother painting it, I carried it back home on the
plane.

I now have two tight used boxes, both outa sixty 7's, priced at a third of a
&quot;rebuilt&quot; and cheaper than the core charge can't even get any looky loo's at a
swap, now pedal pans that's were the money is.
