That's my take on it. I wouldn't take a vehicle out there unless I was
going to sit with it all day.

&gt;The really &quot;Great&quot; Pomonas you cannot see across the  aisle there are so many 
&gt;people.....that just did not happen this time.

That might be great for the sellers, but it's not so great for the buyers!
heheh...of course, without the sellers...there's no Pomona.

See you next time!
