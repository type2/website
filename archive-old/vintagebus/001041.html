I just finished installing all of the components on a new stock 1600 and had
no luck in getting it started.  The coil is brand new, however, I am not
getting a charge when I check the side that the condenser is hooked up to.
Charge on the hot side is fine.  I think the coil may be bunk.  Any comments
or suggestions are appreciated.  Thanks.
