&gt; My Bentley (for bays, but the torsion bar design is the same on splittys)
&gt; has a statement that reads:

Oh yeah?  Well *my* Bentley can beat up *your* Bentley! (And it could - it weighs
about 20lbs!)

From the *BIG* Bentley, the new 1950-1962 (http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/gallery/image/2000183.JPG)
Buy one today!

Page H-10 #3
&quot;Note: when removing both torsion bars, it is not necessary to mark the
left or right torsion bar for reassembly, as an alteration in the direction
of torsion imposed on the bars has no bearing on their service life&quot;
