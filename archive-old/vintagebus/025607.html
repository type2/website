Subject: Frodo gets new floors(and a whole lot more).
Message-ID: &lt;37759E95.3F876D8_at_tconl_dot_com&gt;

After nearly 2 years of ownership and at least 1 award for ugliest
vehicle(NQ saw it in Omaha meet this month) I have begun to prepare
Frodo, a 65 Westy, for it's new sheetmetal. Thanks to Ronnie at Old
Volks Home I have BEAUTIFUL Volkswagen labeled cargo floors and many
other well fitting parts. When they arrived I was tempted to have a
professional do the work. I would hate to do a poor job and waste the
metal. After getting some cost estimates I decided that I would take my
time, use my friends and do it myself. 
So far I have taken out what was left of the cargo floor, 6 long hours
and 2 cuts on my legs. Next came the rear corners, easy to fit no new
wounds. Removed rockers on both sides, 1 bloody knuckle. Last big cut
will be the driver side sheet metal. Imagine replacement rockers that
extend 14 inches up the side of the bus. Well past the floor level and
above the considerable rust along that side.
A friend with the Gas Mig is coming tomorrow to give me a friendly
estimate on the welding. I don't know any painters so that will be the
next chore after the bodywork is done.
I still need cargo doors and a front passenger door that do not require
rust repair. No glass or door mechs are needed. I have a quote for
replacement glass on the jalousies of $10.00 each. With 4 pieces of
glass that makes $200.00. Can anyone suggest a cheaper place to get
them. I want glass and am told that nowdays they have to be tempered
glass.
There are a couple of small places I need to make some bended sections
with curves. That appears to be my biggest fabrication challenge. 
I am taking pics as I go. I will post as I proceed and have time.
Going in again, Wish me well.
