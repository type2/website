Subject: chopped or convertible bus?
To: bus list &lt;vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

Anyone got pics or know of pics of that barndoor-ish
deluxe bus in Cali with the top cut off...or similar
chopped buses like that or someone who has pics, info
or done it?  

Our shop has a customer requesting we do this to a `66
of his that has very severe roof damage due to a barn
collapse.  So any pics and info on the chop would be
appreciated.
