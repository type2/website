Subject: Brake MC clarification?

The links below are to pages of cip1_dot_com are for the dual-circuit MC and the
adaptor to use it in a '67 or earlier bus.

I've purchased the MC but, not the adaptor as the price ($59.95) is more than
the MC ($39.95). I intended to use the procedure by described under &quot;brakes&quot;
in the type2 library. Now, however I've changed my mind and decided the
adaptor may be the easiest route.

My question is: does anyone know of any other adaptors out there that are
cheaper than this? The kit consists only of a machined ring to set the MC back
from its mount, a boot, two bolts, and two nuts. Seems pretty pricey for said
items. Although, I don't have cnc machines to do the fancy machining.

So is it true that a later and cheaper master cylinder can be fitted with an
adaptor to a 68 - 70 Type 2 without problems?
If so this is good news as the 68 to 70 master cylinders are expensive. I
paid over $100 ten years ago.

How much is the adaptor or does it have to be taken from a later Type 2?

By the way I'm pretty sure the first Type 2 discs were 71 not 72 as someone
stated. In Muir's book he discusses the annual Type 2 changes but overlooks
71 disc brakes.
