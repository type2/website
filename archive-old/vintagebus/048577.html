I realize that using a propane heater in an inclosed area is hazardous, but
many things today will cause injury or even death if not handled correctly.
Have you ever heard of people getting killed while skydiving, scuba diving,
skining, roller blading, jogging, walking, taking a bath, riding in a car,
or even eating?  I think we all have.  I even have people tell me they
would hate to ride in my bus because it is too dangerous, and yet they ride
their motocycles!!

I guess the point is, if things are handled safely, the risk is reduced.
So I will drive my dangerous bus, sleep out in the wild (did they catch
that serial murderer yet?) cook my food with an explosive gas, use
unsanitary conditions to prepare my food in, get too close to an open flame
with cothing that could catch on fire and stay warm at night with my
windows cracked and my CO detector in the bus.


&gt;Guys, I know (Knew) a guy who died by using a catalytic heater in his VW
&gt;bus. If
&gt;you want to use one that is not vented, DON'T! Especially if you have one of
&gt;those rare, well sealed busses.....

&gt;&gt; How about rigging a small 12V fan/blower in a window opening, with another
&gt;&gt; window or vent also open, to provide a low volume forced cross-flow
&gt;&gt; ventilation?
&gt;&gt; Low oxygen and carbon monoxide alarms/detectors would still be a very good
&gt;&gt; idea for backup protection.
