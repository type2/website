Is there any way to identify the year of manufacture of a 1964 to 1967
transmission by external case stampings or any other external method?

The only thing i can think of is whether the bell housing is 12V or 6V (ground
out?), and the starter bushing hole 6V or 12V- meaning 67 case is it was made
12V.    Other wise I have looked around, and know of no way.   Also, even if
you know when the case is made, that is no guarantee to what is inside it.
Gearing wise, or condition wise.
