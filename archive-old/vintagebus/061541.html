&gt; &gt; George, that rips it. I'm pulling my kids and grandkids out of school and
&gt; &gt; sending them to your house. What's your address and how much clothes
&gt; should
&gt; &gt; I pack !
&gt;
&gt; Geez, both an interesting and civil thread with differing points of view!!!
&gt; Love it.
&gt;
&gt; If I follow Georges logic, then you would still lighten up the flywheel only
&gt; to a lessor amount, what about the point that was made earlier which is to
&gt; add a Berg counterbalancer! As the berg unit is smaller dia, would there be
&gt; a formula to find a balance point?

Of course, but it gets a lot stickier than my simplified example.  The
I=mr^2 formula works for point masses or thin rings only.  For the real
world it might be easier to actually measure the moment of inertia of the
counterweight crank, by suspending it in air bearings, applying a constant
torque, and measuring its angular acceleration.  This figure would be
compared with the stock crank.  It would be relatively easy to compute how
much material should be removed from the outer perimeter of the flywheel
to compensate for the added moment of inertia of the crank.  As I said
before, the mass removed from the flywheel would be a fraction of that
added to the crank or added by a counterbalancing pulley (harmonic
damper).

That being said, I think that a driver would be hard pressed to perceive
the added moment of inertia of the counterweight flywheel while driving
the vehicle.  The only place the difference could be easily measured is at
a drag strip.

For constant speed, added rotational inertia does nothing except make the
engine run a bit smoother.  It doesn't hurt mileage or hill-climbing
ability.

If I were building an engine for a bus, I would have no problem with using
a full stock flywheel with a counterweight crank.  I'm willing to trade a
few tenths in the quarter mile for an all-around smoother engine and
easier clutch engagement.

George
