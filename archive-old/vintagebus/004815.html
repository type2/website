Subject: I am still an AIRS virgin!!!!  / site update
Date: Fri, 18 Aug 2000 05:44:08 -0700
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

After I get finished updating the AIRS site, I sit next to the phone, hand
on the receiver just WAITING to pick it up first ring.....and now i have
missed my chance. A lady from tuscon called me saying she was driving up to
phoenix and was in trouble. She needed some parts or a shop to go to. And I
wasnt home. At least my girlfriend was, and she gave her directions of where
she could go, so thats good. Ah well, maybe ill get it next time! *grumble
grumble* =)
Anyways - updated the site with new submissions, stories, tire info, and
added a navibar for easier navigation.
Thanx for all the great emails, stories and support I have received!
currently 556 members.. we're gettin about 20-30 new submissions a month
