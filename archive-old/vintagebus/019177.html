Subject: 65 Samba restoration update.  It's alive....
To: type2 &lt;vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

Just a quick update.  I drove my bus for the first
time yesterday.  What a fealing.  After 4 years it is
alive.  Dove good.  I still have a pesky oil leak that
i will attack after the wedding.  Otherwise it went
smooth.  The speedo has a noise in it and i had to
re-set the front right brake return springs so they
would not rub on the drum.

I have all the aluminum at the pollishers right now. 
I should get that back on Friday and get those
installed over the weekend.

Need a little help.  I need to locate a pair of splash
guards.  Anyone have a pair.  Did nto see any at OCTO
over the weekend.  One of the last few things i need
to find.

BTW, OCTO was great.  great turnout and great show as
usual.

Thanks
Matthew
