Subject: Tell me about barn front ends

Greetings All,

My barney had kaput king pins - the way
they're knocking and wobbly I'd be lucky
if it was just bushes....

I always thought I would just use a 'later' set of
spindles with the same diameter link pins..

Well I was looking at barney's front end today
pondering this and the spindles are quite different!  The tie rod
end is at the 'top' rather than the 'bottom' and the 
the tie rods (which are huge in diameter although
probably thread to normal early tie rod ends) 
are possibly going to be too short and 
snag on the (flexible) heater tube and/or front 
beam braces if I fit later spindles.....so...

Does anyone know if the king pins at least are the
same for barn and post-barn front ends?  

There seems to be a fair number lowered barns 
running around the UK, Europe
and the US.  How are these guys doing it?  Surely
they all can't be cutting and turning or fitting adjusters
to original barn beams?  What components are they using?
Dropped spindles?  (then 'later' spindles must go on somehow?)

????????????

Thanks for any info....

regards

RobK
