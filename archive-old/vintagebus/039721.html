Anyone see the Honda commercial with an old Type 2 in it, combi I beleive.  
To paraphrase... &quot;you can put conservation stickers on your car or drive 
one&quot;?  The loaded type 2 is matched up against the new Honda... just caught 
the end but its the Honda that combines electric with gas drive... I think.  
Regardless I am most definitely upset... not an SUV, not a minivan... an old 
tech Bus !!!!  Arghhhhhh !!!
