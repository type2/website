Description:
This camper interior was removed from a pre-march 57 standard. The bus was 
originally purchased in Oceanside, CA and included this &quot;dealer installed&quot; 
camper interior. 

During the late 50ies, the desire for campers was well over what westfalia 
was capable of producing and these small companies started popping up. Here 
is a fine example from one of these companies. I believe it to be complete 
and in EXCELLENT condition. Has an ice box, fold out bed, table, closet, etc. 
Has a panel which goes across the rear of the bus (storage) which was not 
installed in the photos. The price includes the wood interior, the ice box 
and the cushions. Basically, everything you need to convert you're bus to a 
camper. Possible delivery from San Diego to Seattle. Thanks- Greg
