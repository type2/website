Subject: RE: [VB] Run-In With the LAW/me to

motor vehicles offered to reimburse me the back fees i erroneously paid on the sunroof i was refurbishing.  it seems that if a project falls out of registration, back fees don't need to be paid... at least in california, seaside dmv.  all i needed to do was produce the amount i'd paid and they'd figure out how much was due back to me.  of course, i needed to find record of how much i'd paid and as it turned out, my record keeping kind of falls off after 5 years.  i wonder if you could ask the cops for a refund for overpayment?

cheers,
