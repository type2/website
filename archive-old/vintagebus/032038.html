Clara,

I'm a little behind in my posts because I've been driving across the SW 
desert in my '59 Westy, as Ronnie mentioned.  So, as far as I have seen with 
my (recently installed) oil temp gauge, Ronnie and I were traveling from Lake 
Havasu to Escondido this past weekend in incredibly uncomfortable 
temperatures, and I rarely got over 230 degrees.  Ronnie (who lives in Lake 
Havasu) said he thought he was going to die at Brawley w/ 107 degrees and 
about 90% humidity.  I felt the same, but the small nut, stock single port 
1600 engined '59 camper did great.  (I think it must have a 4.12, but it's 
definitely small nut reduction boxes), while traveling at 65+ mph only 
approached 240 degrees a couple of times, and when I slowed down slightly 
(about 5mph), it cooled about 15 degrees immediately.  I think that you're 
right that you have to find the rpm range where your bus is most comfortable, 
but if I can cruise a small nut at 60+ mph, that's gotta be greater than 
2600-2800 rpm.

I guess now I've gotta install a tach, so I'll know.

PS Hwy 78 from just north of Brawley to Escondido, when you hit the mountains 
and cool off and get into the windy roads was wonderful for Ronnie and I!  We 
stopped and just couldn't get over how much fun it is to drive a split bus in 
perfect conditions.
