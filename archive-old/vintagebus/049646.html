Subject: that speedo scan

some folks reported trouble downloading that scan... anyone want to host it
as an ftp or sumpin? gettin' outta my league here...

i left it as a photoshop file (rather than jpg or gif) to preserve all the
info i could - jpgs are lossy.

as far as cleaning it up, i was trying to delete the yellowed film
background, but wasn't getting very far. another approach would be to
reconstruct it, using the original as a template. i think someone who knows
what they are doing could use an arc tool and ray tool, get the numbers to
radiate from the center properly, etcetc.
i am not that someone :P

hey, don't forget  - if you make a nice usable version of it, zap me a copy :)
