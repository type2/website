Subject: RE: [VB] AGAIN an aluminum case update

&gt;  All cases shipped pass
&gt;this test due to not properly torqued cases, when torgued the test gauge
&gt;will not go through (most recent finding) some of the cases

LOL! did they have this problem with the vw cases, ie, do the 
magnesium alloy cases see this prob as well?

&gt;   A machine shop/engine builder in Cali builds 10+ of these engines a month
&gt;and has worked through all the issues. In talking to him the main problem he
&gt;has come across was the dowel pins be offset, thus cause the bearing to be
&gt;off a little causing a crush when the case halves are bolted together, he
&gt;suggested removing the dowels and bolting the case together to see if that
&gt;IS the problem.

hmmmmmmmmmmm....... innaresting. offset in which way? the way my 
bearing was pinced had me suspecting that the bearing was cocked in 
the saddle; wonder if the dowels would explain that? could be that 
NWCRod was seeing the symptom, but hadn't found the root cause. 
wouldn't surprise me, as it would just be more of my $$$$$$$$$$ down 
the sh*tter for nothing :)

my talks with rimco and NWCR  had directed my thoughts to a dull web 
cutting tool deforming the case by moving metal rather than REmoving 
it. that would explain why some were bad and others not (fresh tool, 
no probs; gets worse as time goes on).  next person who buys a case 
and gets a pinch, remove the dowels and see for us :)


&gt;... They just
&gt;need a better quality control before releaseing the product to the consumer.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;EXACTLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;

ronnie, you and i  - and ESPECIALLY - I -  ;)  should not have to be 
doing their r&amp;d and lemon checks for them.
like i said, at the least i want a 'team aip' racing jacket for my 
troubles LOL!!



&gt;   There is plenty of documentation out there now on the durability of these
&gt;cases and I am seeing more and more performance builders going to these
&gt;cases
&gt;
&gt;   So there must be something good about them
&gt;
&gt;ronnie



i totally agree - that is why i haven't given up on these cases. i'm 
interested to see how the extra heatload these things are said to 
carry works in the long run, how long they can go before alignboring, 
how cost-effective it is to weld up holes due to thrown rods vs buy a 
new one etcetcetc.
i would just rather some of the more basic questions - like, does the 
crank fit???? - had been solved definitively before i started MY 
tests!!! lol!
