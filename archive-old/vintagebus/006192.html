The big red light on the dash is for the emergency flashers and I believe
that it is a one year only item for '64.
&gt;
I do not know the exact time period of this feature, but there was one in
a '63 Single Cab I used to own.  Perhaps '62-'64?

&gt;
BTW, if anyone knows how the H*LL to get one of those outta the dash I'd
LOVE to know!!
&gt;
If I remember correctly, the front unscrews from the back.  I have a
story... Nah, forget it.
