Subject: Re: [VB] Strangest injuries

Used to have a friend that had dropped his big old water-pumper off a
jackstand and pinned his wrist under the drum. Had a cheap-ass Timex on at
the time. Had to buy one just like it and then keep paying to get it fixed
because no other watch felt quite as comfortable in the dent.....
