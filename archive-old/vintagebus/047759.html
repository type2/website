&gt; Is that the book with the elves on it?  neat book.  Those flat top

distributors were on 25hp motors, not easy to find relacement caps or rotors

for.

If you're looking, the caps are on eBay all the time, NOS and used.

never tried Ebay for a dist cap, good idea.  I did find a new one for my 53, 
and have the old one, but it is nice to have spare tune up stff, and sometmes 
I see them at shows like $80 NOS   eek.   Rotors are different too.  but 
points are like the 019
