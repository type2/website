In my bus I average 16 mpg, 20 with a tailwind and down to 13 with a
headwind, 1776 single port 6.8-1 compression, mind you this is with a fully
loaded, full length rack and the inside filled to the max.

&gt; Being we have been on the subject of fuel, how about what Grade of gas do

Mine varies between 18 and 20, Mexican engine, 31PICT-3, 60MPH on highway.
I use the cheapest regular gas available.  If everyone did that, gas
prices would come down pretty quick!  The Mexican engine never pings.
