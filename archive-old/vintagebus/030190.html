That is Steve Boeckel of Idlywild, CA. It was at the Classic all the way
at the top of the parking lot. Its missing most of the interior
including the middle seat. But hey last I heard when I spoke to him he
had a 6 leg middle seat on ebay going for $800 with a rusty frame. The
person retracted when he found that out, but Steve told me it was a
friend of his so the retraction was deemed okay. 

He also had a freshly painted 23 window at the Oct. OCTO claiming his
resto work goes for about $50,000, and that's just the labor.
