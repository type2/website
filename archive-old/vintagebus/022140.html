Jim,

I do a small show here in GA that annually draws about 100 aircooled 
VWs.  Every year I send out invitations to the 2 glossy mags and I 
have never gotten so much as a reply from either.

What used to piss me off about it was every year they both would 
cover the NOPI show here which has less than a dozen aircooled VWs 
in attendance (mostly tricked out Japanese cars and lowered mini-trucks 
these days).

Then I realized what was going on...  NOPI ran 2 page color ads in not 
only the VW mags, but also their &quot;Mini-Truckin'&quot; sister publications.  
The mags know where their bread is buttered...

I also think that the glossy mags see the buses as a bit of a &quot;red-headed 
stepchild&quot; when compared to the Beetle (you know, the way WE feel about 
the Beetle as compared to buses) and that there are not enough bus 
enthusiasts out there to support doing that much editorial on them...

The internet has also had an impact on printed publications...  Why wait 
a month or two to get a publication when you can get something on the net 
instantly and free?  Everyone is trying to re-invent themselves in order 
to raise circulation.  The glossy mags are covering water-cooled VWs to 
try to raise their readership.

NEATO used to be one of very few outlets for Vinatge Bus enthusiasts to 
get their fix of old bus info.  I still think Old Bus Review is the best 
Vintage Bus newsletter I know of, but then as editor, I have a very biased 
opinion on the subject.  There is a pretty good mix of trip reports, 
fiction, valuable information regarding bus history, product reports, 
technical tips, and of course several pages of vintage bus classifieds.  
I only print whatever is submitted by the membership, and from time to time 
I write an article, but I would rather the editorial content represent the 
whole spectrum of our members, which is truly diverse.

I have been thinking on the subject of going glossy, but to make it 
economically feasible, it would require a subscriber base of over 2000, 
and we are nowhere near that figure now.  Hopefully NEATO will continue 
to grow, and maybe someday we will be able to fill the gap that Vintage 
Bus enthusiasts are beginning to recognize.
