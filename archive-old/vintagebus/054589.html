Subject: 30 pict 1 wanted

anyone have a NEW 30pict1 for sale? doesn't need to be NOS german or
anything - a bocar would do.  have put 6 carbs on the beast this week, and
all have had one problem or another (or multiple :P)... just kinda want to
slap a new one on and see what happens!

i know ronnie et al have a non-autochoked version, might settle for that if
i have to.


i have a few speed parts for trade, if that helps.
