I've been meaning to write Wolfsburg to find out about my bus...but I
thought I should let the folks with 56 and later VW's know that we need to
mail our 10DM to a different address.

The ad I have reads:
&quot;To obtain factory data on your own 1955 or earlier VW (ie. production date,
engine number, original color, etc.) send your serial number to:
Stiftung AutoMuseum Volkswagen
Dieselstrasse 35
38436 Wolfsburg
Germany
&lt;same adress given before&gt;
The cost for each vehicle inquiry is 10DM.
For 1956 and later VW's, send your serial number to:
Customer Assistance
Volkswagen AG
Postfach
3180 Wolfsburg 1
Germany&quot;

Hope I caught some of you before you sent you money off.  Good luck.
