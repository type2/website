OK,

Just how many of you have worked in a steel factory that produced
exclusively stainless?  Raise your hands!

I have... and you all thought I was only a computer nerd.  OK, I did work in
the computer department, but that was the center of this business... here is
why.  What I will tell you is that the whole stainless business is
specialty... there are only two plants in the entire United States who truly
produce anything stainless... and it is a very small run market, they pretty
much produce to order... or anticipated order (from a specific customer)...

I'm no metallurgist, but I worked with a lot of good ones... and it isn't
just what goes into the metal (the grade numbers you see) but how it is heat
treated, how it is forged, how it is rolled, and then QC.  AND, how it is
tested!  Testing is the real issue.  Certifying the material, down to each
inch of a bar, is a big part of the business....  A lot of important medical
devices (like bone replacement) are made of stainless... believe me, that
stuff is certified in a lot of ways.

Stainless isn't stainless unless you paid to make sure it was really what
you wanted :)  Same ingredients do not make the same cake every time :)
Lord knows what crap some machined parts / cut panels or generic fasters are
made of.

As someone has pointed out, there are stainless steels that do not easily
rust and there are some that rust very easily (like in the air after
cooling).  Fred, mentioning Delorean is a good example of how using the
proper kind does work...  Yet your city contractor example tells more about
city contractors and city management than stainless steel.  Having a diver
fetch from the water, I bet that was cost effective for what surely had to
be lowest-bid product.  And wasn't the contractor held responsible for the
accident?! (yes yes, I did read the expensive tools part...)

Ahh, the good old days of turning a round bar, stone cold, into a hex using
a 1920 era press :)  And we are talking 8&quot; round bar 20 feet long, not some
little thing.  Oh yha, did I tell you they had a strike and us computer
nerds were on the management side and had to work the plant... Ah,
memories...  Can you tell I'm worked up this week because of my wedding
(grin).

Unfortunately, there's a lot more to be concerned about than simple &quot;salt
water&quot;.

In 1984 some boats moored in a local industrialized waterway were damaged by
a City contractor, and among the repairs was replacement of lots of
stainless steel rails and other fittings.  The job was done using top
quality marine stainless, yet by the time all was completed much of the
stainless was already corroded.  Some of the corrosion was from &quot;salt spray&quot;
splashed up from the waterway, and some was from airborne nastiness.

In one case a box of new stainless fittings was lost overboard by accident,
along with a box of expensive tools.  The rigger hired a diver to retrieve
the fittings and his tools from the bottom of the waterway.  When returned
to the surface after ~48 hours submerged, the stainless steel fittings
looked like Swiss cheese.

Granted this is a worst case scenario, but the point is that there's a lot
more splashing around under your bus than just salt water.  It's all the
other corrosive crud in the mix that exacerbates the damage, and even an
all-stainless vehicle isn't immune.

Maybe we could convince Delorean to retool his old plant to build
all-stainless replica Type 2s, factory encapsulated in Teflon or some other
space-age miracle goo :)

FWIW
