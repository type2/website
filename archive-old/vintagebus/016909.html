I just went out and checked my fuses, all looked fine. My turn signals also
seem to be working fine. Does that mean my flasher unit assembly is ok?

  Umm, the switch is purely mechanical and can not conduct electricity
  without being physically operated. The odds are very good that the
  switch is fine. What's probably been toasted is the flasher unit
  behind the front kick panel. The brakes and turn signals both go
  through it (since the same bulb is used for both). However, before
  getting too excited, make sure you didn't just pop a fuse.
