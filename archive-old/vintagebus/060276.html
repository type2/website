Subject: Re: [VB] Leaky tranny

Sounds like you need new split boots.....
Gear oil goes out to the reduction boxes thru the axle tubes. There is NO
grease in there.....
Make sure you use GL-4 in the trans!  Not GL-5.

&gt; My transmission (1965 Type II) has recently begun to drip quite a lot of
gear
&gt; oil from the boots.  I thought there was only grease in there!  I had the
&gt; original style boots replaced about year ago with the bolt on kind, are they
&gt; junk or OK?  The tranny was 're-sealed' about three years ago and when I
&gt; bought it about a year and half ago I found the tranny overfilled with 90
wt.
&gt;  I let some out and have had no other troubles since, until recently.
What's
&gt; up with gear oil in the boots?  Are we talkin' major repairs?
