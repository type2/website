Subject: bus on pbs

on the latest antiques road show (#2 in st paul), they spotlighted 
minnesota ice fishing... and showed a vintage clip of a fat guy in 
hat and cigar, icefishing out the doors of his deluxe!  he must have 
had the heater going, as he was in what looked like a t-shirt (quick 
clip). will run again later in week in most cities, should you 
care........
