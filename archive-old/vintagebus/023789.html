Subject: 1968 Kombi

I've located a nearby 1968 Kombi for sale.  It appears to be complete,
and although the interior (including headliner) requires refurbishing,
all seats are present.  Seems to run fine and clutch and transaxle work
normally (sloppy shift linkage, probably needs new coupling).  Window
glass and rubber are good and intact.  Mirrors, bumpers, door handles in
good shape.  Minor surface rust, except on passenger side dog leg where
I noticed a rusted hole about 1/2&quot; x 1/4&quot;.  Floor pans were solid.  Body
is very  straight with only a couple of minor dings, but sliding door
doesn't quite latch fully at the rear (rear edge sticks out 1/4&quot;). 
Drives fine but steering linkage is very loose.  I didn't have a chance
to crawl under it after the drive to check where the slop was, but
intend to on Tuesday.

The seller is asking $1600 and my questions to the group are 1)whether
this seems like a fair price, and 2)if there is anything in particular I
should be concerned about because this is the first year of the &quot;late
bus&quot;.  All input is greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Dan C
