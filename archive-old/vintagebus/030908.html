Clara spoked:
&gt;I have several mats in my garage to keep my feet from getting cold in the
winter, and its softer on your feet too.  Assorted, included some splitty
ones some DPO cut shorter.
&gt;
Be sure to save those ones that are cut shorter b a DPO, apparently they
are worth more, a guy at the Phoenix Bug-O-Rama was selling one for $70.
 Bahahahahahaha.
