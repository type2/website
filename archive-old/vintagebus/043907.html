Subject: shipping a roof rack
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.SOL.4.02.9812021216070.3938-100000_at_lennon.csufresno_dot_edu&gt;

   I need some advice on the best/most economical way to ship a 1/3 length
non-wood slat rack. I don't know the exact dimensions or weight, but I
think it is to big for UPS. 
   Anyone care to share there experiences? Todd S.?


Thanks!
Todd

BTW-I was surfing the web and found this on the Vespa site, check it out:

   They sorta look like little transporters; single cab, panel, and kombi
(they actually call one a &quot;combi&quot;). They can be ordered as an ambulance,
ladder truck, etc.
  I'm tempted to buy one so my '62's would have a baby brother ;^) It
looks like they would be good for hauling the motor back and forth from
the machinist, etc!

   For those of you that think the Alaska to Tierra Del Fuego trip 
(http://www.vanagon_dot_com/journeys/caravana/) is too much for you/your bus,
check out the story of Giorgio Bettinelli, who is about to complete the
route on his Vesp PX200!

Don't you feel like a wuss now?
