&gt;  Found a Schwinn tandem twinn bike in town and the guy wants $185 for it.
&gt; Need to know if it is worth it or not. It's candy orange/gold color, single
&gt; speed, chrome finders, rear coaster brake,white pinstripe and lettering.
&gt; Don't know year, is above enough to know what it is?? Will look good on the
&gt; bus roofrack and maybe I can get Ronnie to ride double with me! Bike has
&gt; been sitting for years but is ridable as is air in tires ect. Pmail me if
&gt; you have info, thanks, VWHOWARD.
