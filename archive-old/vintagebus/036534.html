why would a 46 year old man, get out of his warm bed
and leave his loveing wife (very understanding, by the way)
at 5 am sunday morning, to get in his 39 year old bus
without heat, to drive 200 miles (one way) to look at a 
33 year old bus, that he purchased off of pictures a few 
weeks previous, just to come home, to go back the next
week to pick up.  busanity?
