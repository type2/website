I've got a starter problem I just haven't been able to figure out.  When I
first bought my bus, a 67 Westy, I soon encountered the failed starter.  In
my inexperience, I just went out and bought a rebuilt starter.  After about
3 or 4 months this starter developed symptoms similar to the old one by just
clicking and not turning over the engine.  I wiggled the solenoid wire and
she took off so I thought I had the problem licked.  Soon this didn't work
anymore.  I took off all the leads and cleaned everything.  It worked for
awhile,  but soon this too failed.  I pulled the starter and tested the
solenoid on the bench and it worked fine.  Eventually I came to the solution
of crawling under the bus and banging on the starter and/or solenoid and it
started.  Well, it's been about 2 months since I've had to bang on it cause
it's been starting fine.  But, today it failed.  I banged and nothing.  I
wiggled and nothing.  I had to get a push to start it.

My question is what is going on in the starter when it responds to banging
on it to get it to turn over the engine.  I wiggled the starter shaft in the
bushing when I had the engine out and it wasn't that bad.   Is something
stuck and gets freed by the banging?  I could unsolder the leads to the
solenoid and look in there,  but I've never been in there and I don't know
if I could fix anything unless it was just dirty or something making it
stick.  Thanx for any suggestions.  This thing has been buggin me since the
first of the year.

John
67 Westy
