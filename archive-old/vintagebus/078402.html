&gt;I decided to go with the aut*z*ne battery yesterday-it was only $32.

For reference, the Interstate 2-XHD I have cost me $65 in September 2002.

&gt;it is right around the corner from me, so replacement if necessary should
&gt;be easy.

Good point.  The Interstate warehouse is about five miles from my house
and about 0.1 mile from where I work, so getting one of those is easy
for me.

&gt;[LAPS won't order Optima] Plus how would I deal with a replacement should
&gt;there be a problem...

The Optimas I've run have an 800 number on the top.  Presumably they
direct you to some local shop, but not everyone stocks the 6 V model.

&gt;I will probably call optima on Monday and tell them how my FLAPS
&gt;responded when I tried to order one of their batteries...

You might try AutoZone corporate as well.  Check their Web site.

&gt;The interstate battery I had was only rated at 550CA and 440 CCA.

Ah, you had the Group 19L one that they sell for Bugs.  The one I run
is a Group 2 and weighs about half again as much as yours.  Suggestion:
if you get it exchanged, trade it to somebody who has a Bug and keep
running the bigger battery in your Bus.

&gt;The new battery doesn't quite fit under the battery strap, not sure what I
&gt;am going to do to secure...maybe a clip could extend the battery strap...

On my '64, the outboard end of the strap is bolted to the floor and the
stud is long enough to give you some adjustment there.  If you just need
6 mm or so, this might be the way to go.

&gt;Is it possible that jumpstarting my car with a 12V battery would cause
&gt;damage to it? I have used those battery pack things on my battery...

It's possible.  I think it would be most likely to damage the regulator,
then the generator.  I have done this once or twice as well.  I try to
really limit the amount of time that the 12 V battery is connected to
the Bus.  I have noted that the generator light will stay on brightly
with the engine running while the 12 V battery is hooked up.  I haven't
noticed any long-term damage, but again, I've only done this about twice.
