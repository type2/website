Hi Everett
The purpose of shocks is simply to dampen the movement of the wheel
after it moves in response to a bump, body lean etc.  Without the shocks
you'd be riding only on springs and would merrily bounce along for a
while after hitting a bump.  Shocks are not intended to assist ride
height in the era our busses were made.  This of course changed when air
shocks came along and jacked up the rear of many a muscle car.  VW
didn't intend the shock to control rid height, just dampen the wheel
motion.
