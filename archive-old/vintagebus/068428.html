Subject: sec:unclassified RE: [VB] Stuck drum

Are you using the 'factory' puller?

The one that bolts to all 5 wheel stud holes
and has the BIG handle?  (You can even beat on
the handle if you really have to....)

That thing will normally move ANYTHING.

If you're not using one is there any way you
could borrow one?
