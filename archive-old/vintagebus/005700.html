'Humpty Dumpty was pushed'

'Who are the Grateful Dead and why are they following me?'

Stop tailgating me or I'll flick a booger on your windshield.

So many snowbirds, so little freezer space.

Horn broken, watch for finger.

How many were there?
How fast were they moving?
Which way were they going?
I must find them, I am their leader!
