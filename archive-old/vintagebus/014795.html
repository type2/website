&gt; &gt; Jack--
&gt; &gt; One thing--I believe Johannesburg is in South AFRICA, not South
&gt; America!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; SA was my short hand for South Africa. Is that incorrect? I guess it
&gt; could be either, or is there a convention on this?

Of course, we have a Johannesburg right here in Southern California. 
It's right next to Randsburg.  Perhaps we should have a bus meet there
as well!  :)
