Hey Guy,  sounds like you are getting steamed and that
is making you miss the main point of this thread.  The
intial post was a guy asked what they were worth,
because he is putting an offer on one.  All the puck
owners replied they are worth bazillions!!....That is
a biased opinion i figure and thru in my 2
cents...(weather you like my post of not is not that
what this list is about?!)  

Any how, the little pucks were worth about $800-$1500
before Jim bought flaunted about and it was stuck in
BIG VW mags.  As we know ANYTHING that hits the mags
is instantly worth quadruple its actual value.  Thanks
to the japanese ect ect....  So now the price of the
pucks shoots up thousands.  Its a bit of a false
temporary value I see it.
----------------------------------

Not missing the point. What I see is that you are
a.&gt; misinformed
b.&gt; for some reason have a hard-on for me. (jealousy,
immaturity, pure ignorance?) I dont get it.

&quot;All the puck owners replied they are worth
bazillions!!&quot;
Fact:
I privately emailed the individual and informed him of
the price range that I've seen which is Free, $300,
$400, $1500, $2200, $3000, $4500 (2times). I
encouraged cheaper the better and gave advice on what
pitfalls to watch out for. Have given behind the
scenes advice on actually **lowering** the price on
the one that was recently on VWPlanet. 

&quot;the little pucks were worth about $800-$1500
before Jim bought flaunted about and it was stuck in
BIG VW mags.&quot;
Fact:
I never flaunted *anything* about. I use my vehicles
for real camping. We took drove 1000 miles to Kelly
Park, camped in our bus, cleaned it and took Second
Overall in TypeII behind a garage princess 23 window
that deserved First. The next day we were camping in
the snow. The princess was back in the garage.
We have 50,000 miles of daily driving and road warrior
action on our 67 Westy... and it shows the wear. I
have taken alot of crap for taking the time to redo a
nice bus. I dont think I'm the sh*t. I dont have any
interest in being a poser or trophy whore. I did the
bus as a personal challenge thinking that a common
person could do as nice of a bus as was seen in the
'zines. I share my knowledge and sources to encourage
my email compadres. Hopefully they can avoid some of
the costs and mistakes that I've made. It's not my
fault that I kicked everyone's asses for a couple of
years. How many green and white 2toned westies did you
see before mine? I got the idea from a local friend.
My vehicles are in the swaps with my friends when I go
out anymore.
Fact:
I was offered $8500. for my Puck BEFORE it was lucky
enough to be featured in the magazine. My wife
&quot;valued&quot;  the Puck more than money so we kept it.
Pucks are cheaper than lawyers and alimony. =) True
story. I wouldnt pay that much or ever advise anyone
to do so. That very well heeled gentleman found one
for $2500. out of the Recycler. Everyone was happy-and
realistic.

Yes, the point is that the recent would be buyer for
the Puck asked for realistic pricing guidance. I'd be
surprised if he'd even think about going for it now.
&lt;Maybe THAT's your point&gt; Trying to ruin someone's
sale so that you can crawl out from under your rock
and steal it for nada? Gofor it bro. Ruin someone
else's enthusiasm for something potentially fun? Why
not. It's the current VW scene!
The point is that you took it upon yourself to do
everything but try to say that they are worthless.
Fine with me... My trailer is not for sale. I have no
intentions of selling. I &quot;value&quot; the potential use
that my family will get out of it in days to come. I
don't care what dollar amount they go for. 
Check the Japanese websites and see what outrageous
yen they are quoting. Seems like they ought to go
straight to Europe (hopefully by passing you) and mop
up all of those spare and easy to find Pucks. 
To me they are simply fun. 
Dude, you are NOT fun.
You and all of the bitter &quot;Rubber Johnnys&quot; out there
are the reason that I will actually camping with
family this season instead of standing around in some
hot shadeless parking lot doing the same old crap with
ignorant pessimistic buzzkill buttwhipes like you.
My friends know who they are. They know who I am. Who
are you?
Jim Ellis
