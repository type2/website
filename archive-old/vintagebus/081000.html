Subject: Re: [VB] Flywheel seal leak/hi oil pressure

Hi Phil,
This morning was waaaay too early!  We meant to check you oil pressure relief 
valve spring/s were stock, not the valve/s themselfs.  Though it is not a 
good idea to use the rear relief valve with the groove in it if you are driving 
in weather lower than 70F.  Also good to check the bore which the FW seal seats 
into and polish with 400 wet/dry sandpaper.  If there is any nick or 
corrosion the seal will not keep in the oil pressure.  BTDT!
  If you mean that the oil pressure sticks when the engine is started when 
warm, then it does sound like a sticking relief valve.
