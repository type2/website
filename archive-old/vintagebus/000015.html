 After staring at it for a few weeks I today tried to do the seemingly
 impossible:
 
 install non-split axle boots on a 65 - 67 axle
 
 impossible it seemed as on these models the rubber stopper mount and the
 brake hose bracket are welded onto the axle tube, making it seemingly
 impossible to pull the boot over them.
 
 After heating the axle tube and the boot and applying lots of soap the
 boots went on amazingly easy. One has to stretch and let slide without
 overstretching.
 
 BTW: when pressing the reduction gear housings off the tubes be prepared
 for a major &quot;CLONK&quot;.
 They are on tight (not as tought as the front king pins though).
 
 The transmission inside seems fine, only one of the big shoulder
 bearings needs replacing. I'll do both since I am this far.
 
 The reduction gear housings can be reinstalled with NEW metal plugs
 which I got for $5 at my local VW FLAPS  :)  guess I got lucky
 All reduction gear bearings will be new FAG/SKF. It was actually cheaper
 getting them from Germany then buying them here. Here I was offered only
 no name manufacturers for the lower outer one (the expensive one).
 
 I wonder what this bus will drive like with an all new or like new drive
 train.
 
 Not liking split axle boots,
  &gt;&gt;
ya- I did the non split boots too, but they went over the flange that gos 
twards the center section.      

I am such a dork and admire them every time I look under my bus.
