i still dont see this vent thing.i guess someone cut it out like the back wall behind the seats.the civiv seats are nice so i think i might try to keep them
my bro came over today and we looked at the hood in back.we used some plyers to turn the handle and got it open.now i can put gas in it now that we opened it.
its so dirty and crustey that i cnat find that vin number.how big is it?

Greetings,
The ID plate on the front vent is only on 1964 and later buses. Plus any 
plates could have been easily unscrewed and replaced. You will have to 
replace the cut out sheet metal behind the seats to get them from dumping you 
backward in an accident and probably turning you into a paraplegic!


You need a square key for opening the gas and engine lids. You can get a 
cheapie repro from Wolfsburg West _at_:

For now you might open it with a slot tip screwdriver if the lock is not 
rusted badly. Once in there use a wire brush to remove the rust coving the 
ID # stamped there.
