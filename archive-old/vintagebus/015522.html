:  POR15 guy said you have to apply it to BARE metal. is it worth sanding all 

Correct.  It reacts chemically with the metal, so has to be in contact
with the metal.

:  the way down to bare metal to apply the POR15 or should i just spray a few 
:  coats of el cheapo primer on them. (its made it 34 years without rust) 

Note that primer per se is not a sealant - that's why you paint over
it.  This is why someone that's driving around in a primer-only
vehicle is going to be disappointed about how much rust they've got in
a couple of years.

NB:  Things may have changed since I last investigated primers, but
that was the situation about five years ago.
