Subject: Chrome plating plastic and middle seat questions

Well here goes, I have two questions for the list.
First does anyone know anything about chrome plating plastic, and if so a
supplier of this service?

Second I have a middle seat for my 63 DLX that has the plastic end and
center pieces for the grab bar. Well my center piece is broken and needs to
be replaced. I am looking to repop this part in chrome plated brass, what I
need is some one to loan/rent/sell me the middle piece and one end piece of
a deluxe seat to do this. I will then make a rubber mold of the parts and
return your original parts cleaned buffed and shined.
Also I will be happy to make more of these available for those that want
them.
