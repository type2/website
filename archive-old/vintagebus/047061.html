Subject: No KP for me, and Camper Q's
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Oh man!!!I am totally bummed out now. For the longest time, I thought KP was 
next weekend. I have to work This Sunday, and it is too late to get it off. I 
am going to Big Bear from LA. The best part is I am getting paid driving time 
and mileage if I drive. BIG $$$, but I would turn it all down for Kelley 
Park. Oh well, I guess I have to wait until next year. (boo hoo :-(   )  
    Anyway, I told you my story about getting camper interior for my '58. I 
got all the tools I need today, and am going to put it all in tomorrow. My 
question is, do any of you have suggestions on what to do for panels. The 
entire inside is just the painted metal. There is no rust, so I just need to 
put something in. I think real panels would look funny with camper interior. 
Thom...you put wood panels in your '55, how did you do that. If anybody else 
has any better suggestions (easy, cheap, better looking, whatever...) I would 
love to hear it. Thanks in advance. 

Jason 58 standard...(camper) ssshhhh!     :-)
I love my bus!!!
