Subject: classic insurance

in tex-ass, state farm let me insure the bus and the (departed) 50 
chevy truck for stated value; here in aridzona, i am not allowed to 
do that. allstate would have added the 50 for $100/yr, no mileage 
limits, to our other policies.  some states have rules others dont, 
but i think AZ is just different due to the horrid amount of 
accidents/thefts/scams here - trying to limit exposure.
