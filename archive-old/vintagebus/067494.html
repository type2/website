Subject: Re: [VB] broken clutch bolt

As for gland nuts it is best to replace them everytime you remove the flywheel. Stay away from using impacts on the gland nut unless
you are removing it and are going to replace it. I have had a gland nut break off while setting the end play. We had removed it via
an impact gun. Where it broke was right below the hex area. It is real thin there and takes all the load from the torque. Impacts
stress this area causing the metal to fatigue and crack causing the hex to snap off. It is cheap insurance to replace the gland nut
each time in respect to what a flywheel, clutch assy. and crank (and anything else destroyed) should the gland nut let go or loosen
up due to weakened nut (I have seen many a crank/flywheel destroyed). Many would say to reuse it so this is just my opinion but I
have never had gland nut let go or come loose on any engine I have ever built and I use new gland nuts each and everytime.
