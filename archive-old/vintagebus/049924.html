GDasson_at_aol_dot_com sent me the following message privately, and I do
appreciate his trying to keep a flame war off-list, but I think the issue
of aftermarket parts is on-topic, so I'm sending his message and my reply
to the whole list.

A particular concern I have is the way the magazines typically feature
aftermarket parts with 'puff piece' articles, emphasizing the upside of
various parts and modifications, but neglecting to mention the downside.
The customer only learns the downside after he has shelled out his hard
earned money, and modified his vehicle, sometimes irrevocably.

&gt;&lt;&lt; I'm not generally condemning hot rodding or the like, but everyone should
&gt; be aware that there are often many carefully engineered factors designed in
&gt; to every component of your VW.  Many of these factors may not be readily
&gt; apparent at first examination.  You can't expect a part or kit engineered
&gt; by a couple of guys in their hot rod shop to be as good as a genuine part
&gt; engineered by perfectionist Germans with engineering degrees and nearly
&gt; unlimited budgets, using state of the art tools, labs, and equipment (for
&gt; the 1960s of course).  I'm not meaning to blast anyone here, so don't flame
&gt; me, OK? &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I'll try not to flame you and I certainly don't want to drag this out, but
&gt;this is the most idiotic statement I've ever heard on this list! We've been
&gt;building, repairing, modifying, and racing VW's and Porsche's since the 60's
&gt;and your statement has absolutely no merit.




Well, you obviously have an ax to grind if you are selling aftermarket
parts or you are modifying customers' cars (if I understand where you're
coming from), but I'm curious about how you can conclude that an entire
paragraph, including several points, can have &quot;absolutely no merit&quot;.  Can
you be more clear?  For example:

&quot;there are often many carefully engineered factors designed in to every
component of your VW&quot;

Is this not correct?

How about this:  &quot;Many of these factors may not be readily apparent at
first examination&quot;?

There are well funded engineering departments at all major auto
manufacturers whose job it is to disassemble their competitors latest
products, and examine them to see how they are made.  These departments are
staffed with well educated engineers, with the latest technology, and still
it took years for Detroit to get close to catching up with the excellence
of Japanese and sometimes German autos.  Obviously these engineers were not
able to easily detect the factors which made their competitors products
superior.  If these engineers couldn't figure things out so easily, I have
little confidence that a much smaller aftermarket supplier will be able to
figure things out either.  Do you think that aftermarket suppliers and
designers are able to discern all of the factors engineered into factory
parts?

Or &quot;You can't expect a part or kit engineered by a couple of guys in their
hot rod shop to be as good as a genuine part engineered by perfectionist
Germans with engineering degrees and nearly unlimited budgets, using state
of the art tools, labs, and equipment&quot;

Are you saying that aftermarket suppliers have engineering abilities and
manufacturing expertise equal or superior to the much better staffed an
funded auto manufacturers?

Now, lets get real.  Every component of an automobile sold today is the
result of many compromises.  They must trade off cost, ease of manufacture,
ease of assembly, many performance parameters, government regulations,
marketplace perceptions of the merits of various technologies, etc, etc.

Aftermarket products, in my experience with my own $$$, and from what
knowledge I have gained through study over 30 years, are usually not
engineered nearly as well as the factory parts, but make up for that (for
certain applications) by making a much different compromise is the
aforementioned design factors.  The aftermarket parts may be far superior
for certain specialized applications (typically racing or off-road), but
they are rarely better for all-around on-road use by the average driver.

I can give examples of the unpublicized downside of various aftermarket
products I have purchased over the years if anyone is interested.
