Hey all..
Thank you to all who replied.  I'll be running a compression test on it
the next time I see it...and hopefully I can get away with a top end
rebuild.  I'm going to try and find a different motor all together to
avoid any more problems with the mofoco motor.  I really don't want to
see that gold painted case again.  I can't believe they're still in
business.  I think they get all their dough from charging us $15/person
for admission to their show...that I won't be attending this year.  So
haha!! take that mofoco!!  ;-)
anyways...I hope the heads aren't harmed....if they are... well... we'll
see how they're harmed and go from there.  I'll have to tear it down to
really see what the problem is.  I'll let y'all know what it is when I
get to tearing it down.

thanks again!
