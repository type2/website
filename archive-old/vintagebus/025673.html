Hello Volks,

The MexiBeetles we are selling where I work have a special oil pump with
a spin-on filter. I'm told that there may be problems with it with
certain exhaust systems, but looking at the header I have on my bus
currently, it seems that I would have plenty of room for it. This is a
genuine VW setup, so unless someone can convince me that there may be a
problem with it, I'm thinking about getting one for mine...
