This seems to be the case.  If you have a post-61 you might try 215.  I
took an original 6.40 to the tire store.  The problem with radials is they
are wider.  The 205s were a little shorter and the 215s were a little
taller.  215s are just a little tight to squeeze between the drum and the
lip in the rear on the older buses.  Believe me.  I just crammed my 215s
back on.  I have a 205 for a spare so I won't have to get too irritated on
the road.
