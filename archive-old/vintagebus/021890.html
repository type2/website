Subject: RE: [VB] flywheel end play

Hey Dianna,

&gt;So here's the problem. As I understand it, the 3 shims should be two .24mm
ones, plus another one of the .30-.36 variety. But the way I see it, I can
only get the two .24mm ones to fit along with the appropriate feeler gauge
when I push on the flywheel. &lt;

The Bentley specifically indicates that 3 shims should be used...  I am sure
there are motors out there with 2, but that is supposedly not the best thing
to do.  The skims should come in all sorts of sizes so try to get a variety
and mix and match until 3 shims equals your necessary end play.

I cannot remember the correct range, but I think it is .003-.006&quot; or
.03-.06&quot;...  You probably know what it should be anyway if you are measuring
the endplay ;)

I have seen people jam in three shims and just run whatever it came out to
be and has worked fine.  And I have seen people have such sloppy end play
you could pull the crank back and forth with no problem....  So I have a
feeling a few tenths either way is not going to blow up the motor.

Good Luck,
