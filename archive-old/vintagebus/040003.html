Hey All,

Wanted to think everybody again for all there help and advice.  It's amazing 
how you can make something so simple so difficult if you concentrate hard 
enough;)  Grounded both buckets and changed one bulb after doulble checking 
fuses and the tail lights reversed!  Swapped 2 wires on the right side and 
they work perfect!
