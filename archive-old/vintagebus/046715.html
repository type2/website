&lt;&lt; The compression in #2 seems a little higher to me.  Does this do any harm? 
 
 Is there anyway to cure this without take the head off?&gt;&gt;
Hi Michael,
Would be interesting to know what compression you would get with a little oil 
pumped into each sparkplug hole also.  Run high octane gas to prevent 
detonation would be the only way to do anything without taking off the heads.
