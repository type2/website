Subject: Pomona &amp; Westy Racks--

This Pomona was dual carb city--they were all over the place--Found a few
EMPI treasures--I took delivery of two of the Chinese Woody Westy
Racks--They are Nice--I put one alongside of a real Westy rack and they look
Great--Sold the two they were brought to me quickly!! Weather and Friends
were great!!There was a very cool 23 window Samba for sale with the roll-out
camper interior--asking price was around $12,000--Bus prices seem to be
getting down to reality--That's good news--Rich Yost was there with some
real VW Treasures--
