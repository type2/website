Subject: Re: [VB] keys for a 65 bus ?

Hi Oldscholvw,
Since 1955 all VWs used one key for all the doors and ignition switch.  If 
the ignition works (should be a &quot;T&quot; series key and locks) you should contact one 
of the several VW specialty locksmiths availible through this list and 
advertising on Thesamba_dot_com.  One of them should be able to fix your door handles or 
be able to rekey replacement ones to match your ignition switch.
