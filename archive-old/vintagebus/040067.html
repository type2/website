Ok.  I know I'm asking for alot of &quot;yeah rights&quot;, but here it is.  What is 
the fastest you have ever gotten your bus to? and have you ever gotten a 
speeding ticket on the open highway?  Please back up the high numbers with 
hardware.


I just got 75mph today on my new 1600 (downhill with the wind of course).
