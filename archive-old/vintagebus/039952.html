I dont know these people, but I have seen this bus:


They want 2100. When they say cleared for camping interior they are not 
kidding. Its empty, and I mean Empty. No seats, headliner, side panels, 
anything at all in back. This bus is interesting. It has a nice paint job, 
in green, but might have been put on with out any real prep, because it is 
showing rust underneath in a few places. Additionally, this bus is very wavy 
on the drivers side rear panel, and above the drivers door. New primer is 
evident inside. There is no bondo that I can tell, and there are no real 
problem rust holes (small hole developing in floor in front but doglegs etc 
seem solid).
The doors close poorly, and may only need adjustment. The windshield washer 
bottle is missing a working top.
I wrote down some of the mcodes and could probably find them again, but they 
may not mean much given the removal of all interior.
The engine has a pict 28 carb, and (the engine) was rebuilt at some point 
which is evident by a rivited plate, which seems to indicate a b-case. 
Singleport as I recall.
Bumpers are there, but rear has been cut out for beetle style exhaust.
2 opening windows in back, others do not. Seal is missing on rearest 
windows, and engine compartment.

Tinted windows too.

I give no opinion as to the value of this bus, nor do I claim to be 100 
percent accurate in the description ( I have NOT driven it). I am not trying 
to hinder or help the sale of this bus, I merely am trying to describe what 
I saw when I looked at it.
