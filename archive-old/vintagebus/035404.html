&lt;&lt; All lights work except for the reverse lights. I have power off of the coil
and the in line fuse is good, but no power to the lights. I was wondering if
any body knows
 where the switch is? At the shifter? or transaxle? any suggestions ? &gt;&gt;
Hi Jim,
As usual it depends on what year bus you have.  If it is from the latter part
of 1967 model production then the switch is on the nose of the tranny.  If it
is an earlier model it should have a switch bolted somewhere along the shift
linkage.  Eric &amp; Barb
