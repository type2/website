&gt; again,only my opinion.
well,

the owner of the bus is a &quot;drive it on sundays&quot; kind of guy... and he
keeps his busses in a very nice garage otherwise.  His daily driver is a
h*nda.

So that works out rather well, for him anyway.

Besides, in the current market if he did want to sell it about all he
would have to do is paint it and then the japaneese would pay him 30k...

take care,

Steve
