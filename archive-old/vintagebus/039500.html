Happy Friday John,

I have a 66 dlx hard top that I aquired w/ no interior except for a cheasy 
black vinyl bay rear seat (free if anybody needs it)  I bought a z-bed and 
midget closet from a 70 Westy.  I cut the migit closet cabinet at the 
beltline so I still could see through all my windows.  I like how it turned 
out.  You have to cut about a 6-8 inches of the back of the cabinet to fit 
the shorter bus.  I saw another bus a while back that instead of cutting the 
migit closet door in half he fabbed that wood panel to pull out like a 
drawer w/ shelves.  Hope this helps!

Oh yeah...if any body has a non walkthru jump seat they want to get rid of 
I'd be all over it!

So I decided to make my own camper. I am not sure what year
&gt;z-bed that is in there. can I use a early bay window bus
&gt;closet. &gt;
