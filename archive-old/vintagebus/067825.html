Howdy all,

Im reeealy wanting to run some schweet and cheap computer type speakers in
the 64 Delux. Particularly Klipsche ProMedia 5.1's or Logitech 5.1. These
are ~500W true RMS A/C speakers which sound amazing and Im considering
putting 2 sets in the bus (12 drivers, 1000W for $700) using a portable mp3
type harddrive unit (ie; easily removable from a van with pointless
locks!) - All of the satellites can be hidden behind panels/headliner
material... Only problem with this is the power. Anyone have a clue
regarding high output generators for type 1 motors ? I can figure out how to
wire 2 batteries to the existing generator - but I figure the drain would be
higher than the input. Anyone with electrical engineering degrees in here?

Im also considering a sacrilegious modification to my dashboard. My original
radio knockoff plate is still installed and the dash in mint shape. I have
seen a weld job so sweet on this as to seem factory : welding in a section
that eliminates the knockoff. It really looks better than stock. Realising
that this bus will never be on the show circuit, certain non-stock mods are
now seeming more appealing... Thoughts?

Thanks for all of your input,

JT
