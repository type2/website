&lt;&lt;'em.  Like a set of NOS pre-54 &quot;body bumpers&quot; aka rub strips.
I think they'd look cool as hell on there.  Then I could sell my NOS
ribbed rear bumper and retire.&gt;&gt;

B.T.W.,
I heard the guy who had the NOS bumper at OCTO marked &quot;SOLD&quot; with a 1000$ 
price tag was pulling our leg.
I heard from around the bend it sold for 400 bucks.
Good news is ambulance fan prices seem to have calmed down.....last year what 
sold for about 500 is not fetching about 250.
Still high but........
Hopefully this marks a downward trend.
