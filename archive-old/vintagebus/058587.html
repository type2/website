Subject: Re: [VB] where does my spare go?

Only two places it could ever go.  

If you have a walk through it goes in the spare wheel well on the left rear
area of the engine shelf (inside above the engine) just inside of the rear
hatch.

On a bench seat model it goes behind the front 1/3rd 2/3rds
driver/passanger seat.  

Thats it.

Did someone make a walk through out of your bench seat???  That could
explain why there is no spare well.

&gt; hey everyone-
&gt; on my 65 westy so-42, there seems to be no place ot put the spare tire!
there 
&gt; is no well above the engine compartment, nor behind the front bench seat,

&gt; wich was never cut. there are bolts to mount it on the front of the busd,
but 
&gt; ive never heard of those coming from the factory or dealer installed.
anybody 
&gt; got any ideas???
&gt; also, does anybody know if westfalia ever did paint jobs?
