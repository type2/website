A Trailer in KP, ha ha. I hope it's vintage and your bus 100 percent
original. Last year they tryed to charge me and John 2 entries each because
of our 1 wheel trailers, but because they were PART of the bus they didn't,
but they did charge Stan for 2 vehicals because of his small camping trailer
and it WAS vintage. I just talked to Bill Bowmen (past NEATO prez) and
voiced my concerns about KP'S rules and he is going to talk to the person in
charge (he's staying with and helping him with KP) and he's going to get
back to me on the rule changes and KP regulations.

 Ellie and I are going to make it.
 We'll be rollin' in a sea blue and white 67 hdt dlx.
 Well be at KP too. Do you think the powers that be
 will let us tow a small tent trailer into KP? I saw a bug with
 a trailer a couple of years ago, but never bus.

probably, but you dont expect to camp there the night before, they open the 
gates in the morning.

 Now the question part. Are the vent wing latches on 
 our above mentioned bus supposed to have black latches
 or chrome. It has a black shift knob and black dash knobs so
 I'm not sure if the chrome ones are correct. The driver side latch
 is busted so when I fix it, I might as well use the right part.
 Thanks for any input.

chrome for deluxes and standards.  your 78 has 67 only (i hope) dash knobs, 
which should be black, but not the same shape as the 66 and earlier dash 
knobs.   white wheel/steering column.
