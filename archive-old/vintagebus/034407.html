Subject: web page update - belly pans and Aus accessories
Message-Id: &lt;5F23E32C8967D111A5D10000F81F6DE1C9AB80_at_exchvic2.dsto_dot_defence_dot_gov.au&gt;

In line with my new policy of crappier but faster
web page updates I have updated my page on
repro belly pans and started a page on 'uniquely
Australian' bus accessories.

For the belly pans you can go direct to
http://www.pipeline_dot_com.au/users/hoopty/page6.htm

For the 'uniquely Australian' accessory page you can go direct to
http://www.pipeline_dot_com.au/users/hoopty/page9.htm


Or if you really want to suffer you can go to my home page
(URL below) and work your way through the 'update pages' 8-).
