&gt; The bypass valve in an oil filter only bypasses the filter media, the

Good point.  The pressure would rise until the relief valve opened in the
case.  The passages could take that pressure, but a thin oil filter can
may well distort.  If the oil filter gasket is 2-1/2 inches in diameter
and the pressure is 70PSI, the force on the face of the filter would be
350 pounds which could distort the sealing surface and dislodge the
gasket.
