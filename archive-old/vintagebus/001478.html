And how ironic a policy...

When VW was first entering the US market they required new dealers to
purchase and stock an enormous inventory of parts and service equipment.
The capital investment was prohibitive, and only parties with a great deal
of wealth could afford to tie up so much money before selling [or even
receiving] a single vehicle.

And the dealerships were required to maintain this unusually large inventory
of spares in order to retain their franchises.  VW inventoried and inspected
the dealerships frequently, and woe unto the dealer found wanting.

Even a medium-size VW store had sufficient spares in stock to assemble a
couple of Beetles, right down to the last nut, bolt, spring, and piece of
trim.

&gt;&gt;  Here in South Afrca much of the air cooled parts stock of dealers was
crushed when it was declared obsolete!  VWSA appartently actively
discourages their dealerships from selling on their obsolete stock in favour
of sending it to the crusher.  I can only imagine what sort of stuff was
lost in this way.  &lt;&lt;
