Subject: [VB] media blasting - propane tank
Message-ID: &lt;19991121035444.73010.qmail_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt;

I have purchased little cylinders of helium (for blowing up ballons for
parties, etc) in tanks that are the same size as propane tanks.  The valve
was obviously a bit cheesier, but that would make it easier to pull of
anyway.  The tank cost around $20 (full of helium, too!) and you could
probably pick one up at a party supply store.  The tank probably isn't as
thick walled as a propane tank, but it would probably do the job.  So throw
a party, invite all neighborhood kids to smooth over relationships with
their parents about all the buses on your lawn, then build a sandblaster
with the leftover tank!

whaddaya'll think?
