seeing as the original poster has a 67 deluxes, I would say it is not 
blue/white, but green/white or red/white, which in 66 &amp; 67 came with the mesh 
plantinum interior, which gets thrashes easily, so evidently he got repros to 
redo his seats.  


BTW was downtown Oly the other night leaving, was saying goodbye to a friend 
and letting the bus warm up, when a hippy dude comes over and says 67?  I 
told him to look at the gas filler.   Anyway, he was disparaging of my fixing 
it up stock style, rather than hippy dippy.  He said &quot; I like customising it&quot; 
 Well I have been dealing with a PO's 70's style metallic paint and brown 
house paint inside, well mostly that's gone now.   I guess there are all 
kinds.

 Platinum seat covers?  Mind explaining them?  Are they a more original
 style or something?  Gawd, part of me hates not working at a VW shop
 anymore...
 
 &gt;ps. photo's of the event will be posted for those of you who couldn't
