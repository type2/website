&gt;         Sounds like you'd better move out on a farm to store all these buss'
&gt; your finding.
&gt;
&gt;         &quot; No Quarters Bus Farm &quot; Restored buss' and parts, at reasonable
&gt; prices!!

&gt;         I can see it now.  Sounds cool.

    Hey, I resemble that remark....!!

    My very patient and VW tolerant wife and I are closing on an old farmhouse
with a 30' x 31' attached barn on 4 acres the end of this week...  The Barn will
be housing a '73 Westy, a '66 Westy pop-top, a '73 Deluxe, and an '84 Vanagon.
Outside will reside the '87 Fox wagon, my wife's '89 Olds Cutlass Supreme, and
my daughter's '99 Saturn SL2...

    My wife has already agreed to let me run power and water out to what is now
a 1+ acre horse paddock so when our LiMBO or Westy blessed friends come to visit
we can provide hook-ups for their convenience...  (Gonna have some great parties
this summer!).

        Tentative signage out at the road:  Lightning Bus Farm (there is a large
lightning split oak on the back of the property)...

        JonR

    Bright Orange '73 Westy &quot;JULIUS&quot;
