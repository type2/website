&gt;I have a question relating to this, my gas gauge gets covered in
&gt;condensation on
&gt;the inside everytime I drive.  How do I dry out this sucker?


1) soak dash area in kerosene.

2) light dash; heat of flames will dry out gauge.

3) buy new bus, one that DOESN'T have condensation problem to begin with.

Hope this helps, wfm, ymmv.
