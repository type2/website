Subject: Re: [VB] Window doors &amp; popout glass

66 door will fit just fine on a 67.

For the side windows, Popout glass is slightly smaller than non popout glass.

&lt;&lt; I scored a pair of '66 doors off a wrecked '66 Kombi from a friend as well 
as the glass. I think the doors will fit on my Panel which was built in late 
'66/early '67 but I'm not sure about the glass. It comes from popouts and 
while one of the pieces of
 glass still has the popout frame the frame is rusted to hell. Is the glass 
slightly bigger for non-popout glass or with the correct seals will this 
glass fit? &gt;&gt;
