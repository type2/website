&lt;&lt; the singing mechanic suggested that i put a paper air cleaner in place of 
the old oil bath for the winter months because of the oil in the bath 
freezing up. do any of you have any thoughts/suggestions?  &gt;&gt;
Hi Casey,
Try instead 20 W/20 or for even colder conditions 10W.  The only time VW used 
a paper air cleaner on the upright AC engine that we know of was use as a 
prefilter to keep out the big gunk (Connected by a hose.) before the oil bath 
air cleaner for extreme dust conditions.    Eric&amp;Barb
