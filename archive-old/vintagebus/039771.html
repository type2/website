&lt;Do you feel a pulsing in your brake pedal when you step on the brakes?   
That's a big hint that the drums need turning.  Maximum allowable drum 
diameter can be found in your Bentley
&quot;I am not sure what that pulsing feels like.&quot;
When you step on the pedal while driving you would feel the pedal 'bouncing' 
against your foot.  Again, if you don't have to turn the drums, don;t do it.

By your post, the brake lines (hoses) are 4 years old, I've had 'em go bad 
in 1 year.  You say the master cylinder was replaced and brakes adjusted a 
year ago.  A year is a long time to go without a brake adjust if you drive 
your bus regularly.  Brake adjust is a monthly maintenance item for the 
Burrito Express, my daily driver which will see 42000 miles in 12 months.
