&gt; I was wondering if anyone has any information about the so-called
&gt; &quot;side-loader&quot; Single Cab.
&gt; 
&gt; This is a Single Cab where the toolchest door and the front 1/2 of a side gate
&gt; were merged into a door that folded down, similar to the rear of an Ambulance
&gt; Bus.  The front 1/2 of the bed was also cut out.

Sounds like a cross between a SC and a Covair Pickup.

If it's worth doing, it's worth doing
yourself.
