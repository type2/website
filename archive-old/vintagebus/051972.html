Subject: 1971 bus and 1988 Porsche steering wheel

Who has experience with fitting a 1988 Porsche steering wheel to a 71 bus?  
The bus
splines are too big for the Porsche steering wheel. I know that it can be 
done, but I'm looking for the easiest way. 

What I know is that a 1988 Porsche steering wheel fits my 1974 Super Beetle 
perfectly. I bought another one for the 1971 bus, and it didn't fit. My hand, 
Scott, warned me about this probability, but I didn't listen.

Can I get a find a junk 1974 Super Beetle, cut off the steering column 
spline, and weld the spline on the shaft of the 1971 bus? Outside of danger 
in steering failure, 
(which gets my attention),  what other ramifications am I looking at? I 
realize that the
bus with a 15-3/4 inch steering wheel vs 17.5 inch for the bus, will be 
harder to turn.

Parts houses such as So Cal, which sell adapters for their steering wheels is 
another possible source. Is it possible to buy an adapter for the Porsche 
steering wheel? Really. this would be the perfect solution to the problem.

Any other suggestions?
