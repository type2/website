&lt;&lt; If you are putting curtains in a kombi, there are no rules for correct,
 as there were never curtains in them stock. So do what looks best. &gt;&gt;
Hi,
We even know of volks who sew magnets into thier curtains so they just have 
to throw them up in thier buses at night.  No screws, rods, or other 
contraptions.

&lt;&lt;The original westy curtain rods are very nice, if not easy to find. They
are made of extruded aluminum stipping, and have a cool little fold in
teh middle where it allows the curtains toi overlap for privacy where
they meet.&gt;&gt;
The 1963ish and earlier Westies used a mini bungee material to make thier 
cutains to hang from.
