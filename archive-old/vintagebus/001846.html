&gt; I'm trying to think about the most efficient
&gt; sequence for painting, masking and fitting doors etc.

Interior and door jambs (including hatch jambs) first. If you did the
exterior first, you would run the risk of overspraying your exterior. Spray
the inside of the doors with them off the car and then put the doors on to
do the exterior. Don't forget to mask off the jambs when you paint the
exterior or you'll get overspray on the newly painted jambs.

I would then paint the bottom first, mask-off the botom and then paint the
top. That way if you were to brush against the car while painting the top,
you would run less risk of scratching your nice new coat of paint on the
bottom.
