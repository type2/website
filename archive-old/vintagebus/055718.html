Subject: Re: [VB] Personal lawsuit?

The VB list is spread so far and wide I can't imagine there being a bus that
is more than 100 miles from someone on the list.  I think most would be
happy to help a fellow VB listee out if they were willing to pop for gas a
bite to eat.  The $50 - $100 investment may save you thousands of dollars
and tons of heartache.

&gt; I am NOT a lawyer. This is opinion NOT legal advice.
&gt; When in doubt CYA - cover your &quot;Action&quot;, get real
&gt; legal representation, accept the risks or step back
&gt; from the deal and wait for another day. Things have
&gt; tendancy to work or not work. If it isn't working then
&gt; don't push it.  Simply figure that &quot;Ben Pon&quot; or other
&gt; deities of your choosing have a plan for your life.
&gt; You DON'T wanna mess it up. P*ss your money away on a
&gt; bad deal and you won't have the money for the deal
&gt; that &quot;Ben&quot; had intended for you. That &quot;deal&quot; might be
&gt; a broken water heater or unexpected trip to the
&gt; emergency room for that fifth three-eyed, web-toed,
&gt; red headed child that you love so dearly...
&gt; IMHO,
&gt; -Ellis
&gt;
&gt; Life is a risk, calculate accordingly...
