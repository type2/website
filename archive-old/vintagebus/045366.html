 &lt;&lt; So are you taking offers until then or are you just a tease?  ;)   Just
  curious, I would like to pass the info on to a non-listee here in Phoenix. 
&gt;&gt;
 
 Actually Thursday is so that it can run 10 days and end on a Sunday night.  
Everyone seems to be home to put in that last minute bid on Sunday night.  
8-)  I kind of hate to sell it on Ebay but I don't know of a better way to 
sell something quickly other than to offer it at a deep discount which isn't 
a real attractive option ever, but not especially now.  If there is anyone 
*SERIOUS* I will listen to any offers and reasons as to why they should be 
the next owner prior to the auction.  I will not cancel the auction once it 
gets started.  I can be reached at 816-254-3255 most all day.  Call at a 
reasonable hour please.  Central standard time zone, 2 hours later than the 
West coast, 1 hour earlier than the East coast
 
 FYI - I think it is fairly common knowledge in the &quot;Barndoor Circle&quot; what I 
paid for the bus.  Since I bought it I have bought two other (rough) BD's to 
get the parts to make it more correct.  In many ways it is quite a bit better 
than when I bought it.  I haven't quite figured out what my reserve is going 
to be yet...something slightly above what I have in it, but reasonable.
 
...and now back to doing the taxes.  8-(

Thanks,
Dan
