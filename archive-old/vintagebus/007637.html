ok, this is my last hope. I have scoured the Net and literature for 3 months
now to try to answer this mystery on my own, but alas....I need HELP...SOS

I brought home a '67 Dormobile on 04/01/00. It is primer white, but there
are places that are peeling and places that were missed where other paint is
showing through. Previous owner says the color I am finding is the origianl
color. I am in love with the color and wish to repaint the bus. However, I
can not seem to find the paint codes ANYWHERE... Here is ecaxtly how my
M-Code plate looks:

01D
139    181
430    056    080    091    119    121

    2312    523654    7066060

Any information would be so greatly appreciated!!!

Oh yeah, the color is a green, shade falls in between a Velvet green and a
Delta  green....the passenger seat matches it as well, but it came to me
missing the driver's seat...
