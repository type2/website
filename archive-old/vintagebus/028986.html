Subject: Shipping a Type2 from Germany.

Hi List, I am interested in shipping a SC from Germany. Has anyone done
or looked in to this? I know a guy that brought a Vanagon Ambulance
back. He said it was quite reasonable if you drive it to and from the
shipping ports. The Van arrived in Halifax Canada (east coast) for
around $1000 CANADIAN dollars. 
Any info would be appreciated,
TIA

Michael
