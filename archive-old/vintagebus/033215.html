Todd,

I'm sure that in the land of the VW there is someone in 
your area that is good at this type of work.  What you 
could do ask some of the local VW shops who they have
do their gearbox work.  If the same local name keeps 
coming up then he's (or she's) the person to go with.  If
they all ship their gearbox work out then chances are either
there is no one in the area that is set up for this or they do
not trust the local builder to do a good job.

FYI- Its pretty easy to ship a center section of a transaxle
via UPS or FedEx.  I just shipped one from Olympia, WA
to Robert Davis in Santa Barbara, CA.  Its wasn't too 
expensive and took less than a week to arrive.   If you 
cannot locate a builder in your neck of the woods please
email me and we'll see what we can come up with!
