Subject: Re: [VB] ...Engine Question...

&gt; My friend is in the middle of aquiring a '69 bus With no engine... We just  saw a '62 beetle engine for sale
in the paper and was wondering:

 -Could we drop it in the bus with no major modifications?

 Engine specs:

 1200cc 40 hp engine
6 volt generator
36Hp type fan shroud

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Two problems:
1) the 68 and up bus requires a rear support bar on the engine. The early bug engines do not have the
provision for it. [you can get a aftermarket bracket that bolts on the oil pump, but I would not do
it....others have with mixed results]

2) the 6V flywheel will need to be replaced with a 12V flywheel. But if you have a stepped crank, this is not
a good thing to do.
