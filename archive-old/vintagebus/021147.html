Subject: POR-15, can you get it off the bus?

Hello, list.

I am considering putting POR-15 on some of the bad areas on my sheet metal 
until I get enough welding/painting skills to tackle &quot;doing it right.&quot;  I know 
how tenacious this stuff is so my question is, Is it possible to get this stuff 
off later so I can get at the bare metal?  Maybe with some kind of grinder?

Thanks so much.
