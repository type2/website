Subject: brake questions

Hi List,
My 63 crew cab is having some breaking problems. It
keeps &quot;gaining&quot; pedal. I've replaced the master
cylinder, brake hoses, and wheel cylinders on one
wheel that was obviously leaking. The other wheel
cylinders seem fine. Has anyone had this problem and
if so, can anyone tell me what the heck else I can
look for?

Thanks,

3DPete
63 crew cab - Buck
