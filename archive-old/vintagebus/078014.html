Subject: Re: [VB] Rubberized Coatings - an Interior Rust Preventative?

&gt; I used a non-petroleum based Henry roof patch goop on the inside of my '63 DC.
&gt; Uses some kind of clay as the binder and is water soluble until it dries. No
&gt; solvent smell and it doesn't melt in the 110f heat we have here. Leaking gas
&gt; has washed some of it off the interior near the filler though. Can't verify
&gt; the rust repelling ability, but it keeps condensed moisture off the inside of
&gt; the body and soaks up road and wind noise pretty good.

I believe I used the same stuff to seal my windshield bottom frames before I
put the glass/gaskets in. Worked really well, except for the disaster when I
opened the can &amp; it sprayed all over the back flap of a new canopy I had
treated -had to use the canvas on my own truck after that.
