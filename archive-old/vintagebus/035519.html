 I've seen NOS barndoor floor outers, so it may have been a production item.
 Given that's it's a common area for rust, and for damage in front corner

I have seen only full floors NOS, except for the coupld pieces NOS which had 
a piece cut out where it had been used for a patch, and the rest left over.

The floor was a stamped unit for install new in buses, dunno if they sold 
patch panels.
