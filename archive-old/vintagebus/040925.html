&gt; Ya get what ya pay for.
&gt; Get the good ones.  I have personal experience with cheep seals,
&gt; and the leakage and aggravation installing them isn't worth the cost
&gt; savings.  On the other hand some of the seals I got from Bus Depot were
just plain wrong.
&gt; Dunno where the came from, but they weren't split bus seals.  I whined,
and Rocky
&gt; Mountain Motor Works promptly sent me out a new set... of bay-window
&gt; seals complete with trim! (hehe, I got some trim!)


It's been quite a while since I had Motorworks ship my door seal kits (for
reasons such as that!).  Actually, my present door seal kit is somewhat of a
mixture, of U.S.-made seals from WCM and Wolfsburg West, with a little
Brazilian thrown in (primarily in cases where the other vendors are
outsourcing that seal anyway).  Essentially I'm cherry-picking the best from
each vendor.
