&gt; I have several motors I'm thinking about putting up for long time

&gt; I'm wondering if it would be unwise to use the oil I have in large

&gt; change intervals?
&gt; Just trying to save some $$, but if it's going to cost me more down

Used oil has corrosive substances that will not be kind to your engine.

Your idea of filling the engine completely with oil seems to be
overkill to me.  You're going to have a heck of a mess getting all that
oil out when you reactivate the engine.

Better to change the oil, put in the specified quantity of fresh,
squirt a couple or tablespoons into each spark plug hole and rotate the
engine by hand a few times.

You can get &quot;storage plugs&quot; that replace the spark plugs to keep the
cylinders dry.  They have a silica gel dessicant visible through a
clear cover that will change color if the humidity gets too great. 
They're available through industrial equipment shops.

You should also dangle a large silica gel packet inside the oil filler
to absorb humidity inside the crankcase.

If you do this and turn the engine every few months, they should be
fairly well preserved.
