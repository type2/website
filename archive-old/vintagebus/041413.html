&gt; How does it react with other topcoats and is it as good as it sounds?
&gt; Any experiences or opinions would be appreciated!

I have used POR-15 on axles etc.  I've never put a topcoat on it, but the
directions say you have to apply a tack coat before it completely cures.
It is thick stuff so I'm not so sure I want to use it in my gutters as it
would be pretty hard to blend into the top paint.  Corroless looks like it
may be thick too. 
I'm going to do my gutters one of these days and was
thinking of using Corroless.  I'd be interested in pros/cons of each.  POR
also makes a filler for American type gutters that have caulking in them.
