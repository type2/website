all you have to do is file 2 sides of the on off rod to accept a lever from
a bus and you have a bus one. That's all the new (NOS,ha ha) ones that
everyone is selling are. Even the bug/bus ones the rod is in the wrong
position and the knob is out for on and in for reserve.

I'm looking for a reserve switch (gas) for one of my projects. I have
many Bug units but no Bus ones.

Can anyone out there help? Is anyone interested in trading a Bug for
Bus?

Thanks,
Greg
