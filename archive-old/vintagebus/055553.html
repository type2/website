Subject: RE: [VB] NOS spindles/kingpins etc

They are the 20 mm link pins with the old torsion arm faces that require
reaming, don't have the new o ring, washer and cap to prevent torsion arm
face wear, which is why you must rema the old ones. I believe the switch to
22mm was late 63. This is fresh in memory since I just did my 66, and had to
check for an old or newer fornt end, beign the disaster mystery bus it is.
It was the Original front end though.
That's why they won't work, too big!

complete NOS setups that include the spindles, king pins, link pins, needle
bearings, grease nipples etc.  His ad says they are VW part #'s 211 405 301C
and 211 405 302C and that they are for chassis # 999305 to 1 144 281.  &gt;&gt;

Hi Don,
Yes, according to the VW bus parts book we have there is a differance.  Yes,
they will fit onto a 1955-63, but if you are going for a full blown NOS or
good used resto it will be incorrect.  We do not know what the differance is
except for the part number, and no they are not part of the M216 suspension.
How much is the seller asking?  We have several sets of perfectly good used
ones to sell/trade since we have gone to the later 1964-67 suspensions in
our
1960-63 buses.   Eric&amp;Barb
