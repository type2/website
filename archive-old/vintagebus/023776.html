Splitty B-pillars weren't designed with human body accident-shock loads
in mind. However, when properly welded and reinforced, they should
adequately handle the load without detracting from the aesthetic Splitty
character. &quot;Beefy&quot; is the word. Beefy like the original lap belt mounts
are. Beefier is better. 
	Overdesign it... build it to take more stress than it will ever have
to... and it won't fail you when you need it to save your life. In this
respect, the combo shoulder/lap belts are clearly superior to the
lap-only belts. 
	All these safety items come after your safe driving habits... of
course. Regardless of all that, a time may come when you'll either
regret not having a three point belt or be glad you did. It's a small
sacrifice for the bus and a competent welder to make, if it provides a
slightly greater chance you'll walk away from an accident.
	And as far as invoking the name of Hoover... he also wrote &quot;hoping shit
won't happen guarantees you'll drown in it when it does.&quot;
	How much would you pay for a shoulder belt when that car from the
opposite side of the interstate loses control and goes through the
median to in front of the bus carrying you, dog, family, whatever???

friendly, of course....

&gt; Beefy. False security and a damaged bus is what you get with such a
&gt; weld-in contraption.
&gt; 
&gt; Better seatbelts in a splitty, by my thinking, is kinda like worrying
&gt; about the toilet overflowing in the house just downstream of the Hoover
&gt; damn. (Bob builds a helluva damn!) Good brakes in optimum adjustment, a
&gt; really good following distance, and a sharp cautious eye will help to
&gt; insure you never need to test those lap belts.
&gt; 
&gt; If you are going to get carried away you could install later high-back
&gt; seats, a 5mph super-beetle front bumber, or, better yet, admit that you
&gt; are not a splitty person at heart and go buy the latest hunk of Detroit
&gt; steel.
&gt; 
&gt; Hows that for a friendly flame?
