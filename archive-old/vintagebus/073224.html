Subject: Re: [VB] Re: And the saga begins

I've always wondered about that one.  They both have
rags on top, so which is a real ragtop?

And, as Rachel knows, I prefer &quot;busses&quot;, but in the
literature for our upcoming &quot;Busses and Balloons&quot;,
it's spelled both ways.

And don't forget Busses and Balloons - October 3, 4,
and 5 - Albuquerque - music, free lunch, raffles,
trophies, lots of fun.  And special for this year
only, it's Ronnie's 50th birthday party!

&gt; heheh.  hey, i have one of those saucepans... even
&gt; if i'm not sure if you mean a sunroof or a
&gt; convertible when you use &quot;ragtop.&quot;  i guess that's
&gt; the point.

&gt; now back to buses, is it spelled &quot;buses&quot; or
&gt; &quot;busses?&quot;  also are there standard terms for old
&gt; vehicles and what we do with them?
