you could try what i did to replace the door liners in the front of my
'67 transporter
i used the old tired door liners as a template for which to make new
ones out of 5mm pineboard.
i then went to the auto upholsterers to get some vinyl to match in with
the rest of the interior.  it only needed 2m and with the left overs i
had enough material to line the kick panels as well.
the thick pine board has good sound absorbtion which is a bonus
my next on the agenda is to make new headliners so i will let you know
how i get on
