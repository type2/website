&gt;With all this talk about engines what is the average life expectancy of a
&gt;good rebuilt 1600dp or 1776dp.
&gt;

You have no idea what a can of worms you are opening.

A 1600 dp is less likely to live as long as a 1600 sp. Cracked heads my 
friend. Although that isnt that big of a deal. It will still run.
They can be made to not break but this costs money. I know of a shop that 
will weld them and change the spark plug hole and guarantees them for 
100,000.

Ok I would guess a really well built engine (less head problems, there may 
or may not be any) should get you at least 80,000 in a bus. Mine did, and is 
still going strong.
However, and I get people on this list telling me its a Ripleys Beleive it 
or Not story, one friend logged 200,000 on a factory engine, and another has 
equal that or more on a 1641. I think balance and maintance is the key here.
Altough the factory 69 engine was not balanced!

Either way you should see many years of driving if you have a decent rebuild 
and you drive somewhat conservativly. No over revving or even worse, no 
lugging.
