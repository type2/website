I would have to say be careful before messing with your box...the problem
may lie elsewhere.  In my '67 it came from totally wasted link pins on one
side and a loose drag link.  My steering box definitely has some wear in it,
but with these other parts repaired properly everything is peachy keen :-)
You might have checked this stuff already, but be sure it's really your
gearbox that's causin' the trouble.

&gt; I am in the beginning stage of doing work of the front of my 66 westy like
&gt; most I have the problem of drifting on the highway from lane to lane
anyway
&gt; I was talking to some bug fok, they claim there is an adjusting bolt on
the
&gt; box. ?? They claim I should crank down on it if I'm having a problem with
&gt; the box.  Does this make any sence to anybody
