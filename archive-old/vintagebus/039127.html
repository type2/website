my first substantive post to the list and it's only to relate the
culmination of a week's work.  monday i finally was reunited with my single
cab after it languished for more than a year in a backyard with only attack
dogs and american steel to keep it company.  from monday to saturday i
worked slavishly to make it roadworthy and reasonably safe.  i put in an
engine i'd earlier converted from 12 to 6 volts, bought a new battery,
installed a different starter, fixed a couple of things i hooked up wrong
(heheh) and changed the tranny and redux gear oil.  i cleaned almost all of
the electrical connections and got all of the lights save the signals to
work, jury-rigged the front bumper and secured a temporary registration.

all this so that i could drive my single cab home saturday night, which i
did!  as i powered down the freeway onramp i reflected on the day; i'd
arrived that morning a passenger in a '51 sunroof beetle, i was now driving
home in a '56 single cab and lookie there - a clean squareback goes zipping
by!  the day had been good and i thought my truck would make it home.  it
did; but now it languishes in my backyard unable to kick over.  at least it
will only languish for a short time and it has good company to share of both
the type 1 and 2 varieties.

cheers,
