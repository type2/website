&gt;
&gt;So this VW dealer that I met has his dealers microfiche set up.  He has
&gt;the machine and all of the sheets that the machine reads.  [...] Anyway,
&gt;what kinda value does this microfiche set-up have?

If the machine is just a reader, US$50 or so.  If it can print them out
as well, it's worth more, but then you have to figure out if you can
still get supplies for it.  As far as the fiche themselves...I don't
know but I'd guess a couple of hundred, tops, maybe?  If he kept them
updated, up to the point when they quit issuing fiche, that's a good
thing.

I think the fiche just have the parts manuals but if they have the shop 
manuals too then they are more valuable.  You might check Ebarf for a
price reference.  People there seem to be selling sets for individual
vehicles, for $20 a vehicle or so.
