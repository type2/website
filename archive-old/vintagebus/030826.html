I have a set of 15&quot; wheels that came off my Single Cab. They are in good shape,
have hubcaps (and hubcap clips), as well as 4 very good 205/75/15 tires. Sumitomo
tires I believe, and now that I think about it I *may* have a 5th wheel/tire combo
as the spare is still under the bed. $150 takes it all. I can deliver to Kelly
Park / Red Barn
