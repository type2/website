&gt; Hope you dont mind me repling to your address as I dont use the list that 
&gt; often so dont know how to reply to just your post.

Hi Kevin,
No problem!

&gt; But my question now is.....Is there any way to make them work?
&gt; Or is the aggravation just not worth it?
&gt; I'm not exactly sure with what you mean buy 90 degrees off?
&gt; If you dont mind explaining that I would appreciate it.

By cutting off the tabs on the locking ring that holds the headlight bulbs in 
and hand aimed correctly or replacing the locking ring and the inner ring 
with bus ones.
    90 degrees off as in if you hold up a penny and have Lincoln sitting 
right side up.  Now rotate the penny either way so Lincoln is sitting on wall 
to either side of you and that is 90 degrees off.  Resulting in your lighting 
only a sliver of the pavement ahead and spacecraft in orbit of Earth.  
Instead of a nice sliver of light from each headlight to illuminate a just 
wide enough beam on the pavement ahead of you to drive safely and not blind 
oncoming traffic and get tickets from the police.

&gt; The only reason I am asking is because I know somebody that has about 20 of 
&gt; these headlight assemblies NOS Hella still in the boxes and he wants 
&gt; something like $60 each for them. So if I could make it work without to 
&gt; much 
&gt; hassle it would be a great deal.     Thanks Kevin

Well it is your bus!  We would just pass on the NOS ones and find some good 
used bus ones to repaint and use, but we daily drive our buses.  You might be 
one of those NOS or nothing type of guys.  To each thier own!
