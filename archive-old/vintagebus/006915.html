&gt; Totally cool
&gt; Is that similar to the Lo Jac principle or something altogether different?
&gt; John Flowers

Similar but not the same.

LoJac is has a transciever in your car
1. car stolen
2. file police report
3. police tell lojac your car was stolen
4. lojac sends out a signal that your car hears
5. your car starts sending out its coded ID
6. cops and lojac start looking for your car using radio direction finding
techniques
7. eventually they locate the neighborhood you car is in
8. Oh, look there's the car.

Amateur Radio APRS
1. Go to your web site
2. look up your vehicle
3. tell cops where to find your car

Side benefit - don't need to file a stolen report on your car.
Two weeks ago, I got my signals crossed with my wife and thought I heard her
say that she and #1 daughter would be home 8-9pm.  Around midnight I was
wishing I had one of these installed in her car.  Turns out that I misheard.
The church function started at 8pm, was over at 11:30pm, by the time she got
done from being lost getting our daughter back to USC from Anaheim and then
back home again it was 1am.  Would have been nice to be able to check, yep,
she's on the road, must be ok.
