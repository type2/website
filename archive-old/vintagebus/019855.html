a few have suggested to re-drill the existing...the problems with this
according to the guy i spoke with:

-reduced strength of flywheel and crankshaft, 
-to do it properly i still have to open up the case to get crankshaft
-the end of the crankshaft would need to be ground down, as it has built  up
where it ovaled, 
-the flywheel installed was not the right one to begin with-explaining my long
term slow oil leak
-the flywheel would need to be ground down where the holes are, as it's edges
has been raised, then the outer lip would need to be ground down the same
amount to compensate for the new fit
