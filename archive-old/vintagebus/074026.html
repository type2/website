Subject: Re: Tires: Issue 2702

Hi All -

from Tom (&quot;Megow&quot;):
&gt;....
&gt;Local VW people have recommended
&gt;205 X 75  15's. Any experience out there with this tire and/or tire size 
&gt;on a 66 Split Window??

I just put this size C range 'Pathfinders' from Discount Tires ($90 each) 
on my '61 single cab, using a 15X6&quot; rim .  Though my wheel wells have been, 
sigh, cut these appear able to fit in stock wells.

I still have 14&quot; rims on the front at the moment, so this jacked up the 
rear about 2 inches of so.  The first time I drove this combo the 
severe  squirrely darting about of the front end was offputting.  This was 
pretty much solved by adjusting the front wheel bearings to spec as they 
were loose.   Now it's not noticeable as I drive, though 15's on the front 
will help.  This change in attitude does not help the stock front brakes do 
their job.

Note that this will change your final drive ratio, so slightly higher 
speeds in each gear are available, but pulling power suffers.

Nick
