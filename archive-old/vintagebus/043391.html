&gt; What do you think of this device...

&gt; It looks like it might well work in a bus...

??? it is 6000 BTU but at $379 you could probably buy a working VW gas
heater that would fit.  also I can see you now going down the road with a
smokestack (you did see that it needs one?) coming out the roof

buy a Eberspracher(sp) or a Wabasto they are designed for motor vehicles
