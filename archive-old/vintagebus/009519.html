Hi Thom,

I started this metal thread. I was just wondering, does the
WW lower nose repair piece replicate the original VW
foldings of the metal? I need to get something to fix up the
front of my bus now that I have it cut off and I don't
really like the Schofield piece.

The original upper nose sheet (with V) overlapped, by about
two inches, the sheet behind the bumper. Upper nose sheet
had a 1/2&quot; flange at the bottom with another piece
bent/crimped around it that also extended down about a 1/2&quot;
and was spot welded to the sheet behind the bumper.

Please reply about the WW part.

Thanks,
Chris
