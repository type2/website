 Obsessive Vintage types may want to pass on this question as it does imply 
 certain actions...
 
 Is there an advantage or disadvantage to using the big nut RGBs over the 
 small nut variety?  Intuitively I would expect them to be stronger?  True?  
 False?  Other points?
 ____________________________ &gt;&gt;

many people prefer to use the big nutters as they have higher gearing (1.26 
vs 1.39) and the larger brakes  main reason.  The small nutters have the 
advantage of cheaper RGB bearings, and lower gearing for those mouse motors.  
 While the 63 option 1 ton variety have both the higher gearing and the 
larger brakes, while retaining the the cheap bearings, they also have the 1 
year only option drums, hard to find if yours get thrashed.  

yes, the early ones may be easier to bend.  I have unfortunately bent one, 
which took a lot of effort, including an icy mountain pass and tipping the 
bus on it's side at a slowish speed (15-mph?)   Less damage that if we rolled 
down the slope though!!!!   However, I have not conducted a scientific test 
by repeating this with a later stub axle, nor do I recommend this to anyone.  
Also bent were the front trailing arms on that side.  Cost $25 in parts and 
an afternoon to fix.    (take the parts of that old rig, you can work on it 
round back, said the guy who ran 'marginal mechanical repair'  :)
