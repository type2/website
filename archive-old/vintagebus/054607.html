&gt;Does anyone know if Lego actually fabricated vw bus toys way back when?
&gt;i have an old lego book that shows minature vw  busses in them.

More recently, you could get a model that looked suspiciously like the
bottom half of a Bug in the &quot;Expert Builder&quot; line (now called &quot;Technic&quot;,
I think).  I had this model in the mid-80s and I should still have it
around here someplace.  It was built on two long beams that ran down
the center of the car.  In the front there was rack-and-pinion steering
and a little box that was supposed to be the gas tank.  I don't recall
what the front suspension was like.  In the middle it had two flat
plates as the &quot;floor pan&quot; and seats on them.  There was also a gearshift
(two forward, one reverse) between the seats.  The back wheels had
independent suspension, but it was more like a McPherson strut than a
torsion bar.  Between the wheels lived the transmission and differential.
The boxer engine hung out the back; it even had a short &quot;generator&quot;
sitting on top with a fan in the front and a rubber band &quot;belt&quot; to
the crankshaft pulley.  In front of the fan was a little black wall
which I think was meant to be the fan shroud. 

The whole thing was about 1 foot (30 cm) long.  Google is great; I
found it.  #8860,  http://www.chem.sunysb_dot_edu/msl/lego/8860.jpg .
Given some more Technic bricks, there's no reason why you couldn't
stretch this thing a little and build a Bus body on it.  :)
