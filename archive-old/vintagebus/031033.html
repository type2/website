Interesting, I read the email noted above and reviewed the web site of the
party that sent the email.  Based on that, I would completely ignore the
notification until such time as I received a registered letter (which I
would refuse) or other written letter backing it up.  It appears to just
be a scare tactic.

To the best of my knowledge, an email does not constitute a valid notification
unless you agree, beforehand, in writing, to be notified via that medium.
 This is how my Bank and some of my personal accounts do business.
