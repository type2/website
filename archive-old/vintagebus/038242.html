Hi all,
Here is more stories and observations about driving my panel.
 
I was adjusting my passenger side rear view mirror last night and *bink!* it
breaks off in my hand. Just like the driver side one did when I first got my
bus. Boy those mirrors sure do suck. So when I got home I dug through my
stash of odds and ends and jerry-rigged my round smoked-glass beetle mirror
to fit. Cool, now I have a mirror for the blind spot. Except when I wake up
the next morning to drive to work. The mirror is too dark and too small to
see anything out of. Not to mention it is raining and the the wing window is
all fogged up. So I think &quot;Hmm... when I drop off the stack of X-mas cards
at the postoffice I'll pop into the auto parts store across the street and
buy one of those bubble fish-eye stick on mirrors.&quot; Dropped of the mail
bought the stick on mirror an, TA-DA! I can see the side of my bus once
again. A set of elephant ear mirrors sounds real good about now.
 
So, now that I'm sufficiently pleased about the mirror being fixed, I notice
my dash has become a waterfall.  Damn those cursed window rubber goblins!
(Did I mention it rains a lot in Seattle.)
Looks like the window rubber needs to be replaced right away. I could just
seal it up with tar and wait till spring, but the sills are in such great
shape (No visible rust anywhere) I don't want them rotting during the
interim. Maybe Sunday I'll remove the window, check for rust, dry it all
out, put in new rubber, and tar up the joints. Simple enough, just hope it's
not raining. *Fat chance*
 
Here is something I've noticed about the cab divider. When driving at night
the cab divider reflects the oncoming traffic's headlights in the rear view
mirror, making it look like you have cars behind you. It was a little
distracting at first but I've gotten used to it. 
Also it is missing the felt bumpers that go at the two top corners, so it
kind of squeaks and vibrates when I go over bumps. Squeak, squeak on almost
every bump. :-P
 
Did you know air in the tires does a lot for handling. I'm getting gas at
the ol' petrol station and see the air/water thingy is actually working, and
it's free. I Check the tires and they all read around 20 psi. No wonder it
drives sluggish and is a bear to turn when going slow. Pump up all the tires
to around 31 psi and WOW what a difference. The steering wheel feels light
and the bus is zippier. Looks like it was in storage just a tad to long. It
was a good thing I didn't end up with the tires going flat on me. 
 
Going to need two grey painted hub caps for the panel. It only came with
two. I might just paint some nasty chromey ones temporarily, till I can get
my hands on the proper ones.
 
Well that's about it for my ramblings. When I have something new to discuss
I bore you with that. ;-)
