Well I finally put my engine back together and got the old bus going.  I 
ended up breaking a wrist pin clip which ultimately chewed up the inner 
surface of the cylinder and scarred the piston pretty bad.  Ended up with 
cracks in both heads.  Cracks at every plug :(  I also some how managed to 
spin a rod.  

So I ended up taking the case to Mike Fisher for an inspection and align bore 
and thrust cut.  While we were at it we balanced it and iI am waiting to see 
the benefits, that many have talked, about for myself.  Everything is new 
except for the case and reground german cam.  

Put the thing together down at Valley Engine Service in Phx. with the help of 
my friends Bill Brooke and Dale.  We had to take the sucker apart 3 times 
because we kept having studs pull but oh well it's fixed now.  

If anyone has some comments on the benefits of balancing I would really like 
to hear them.
