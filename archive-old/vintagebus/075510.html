&gt;I have never gotten into the habit of putting the bus in gear when I park
&gt;it. I am going to try to do that...another reason-the last squareback that
&gt;I owned had it's front end smashed in when the previous owner neglected
&gt;his emergency brake, and had the car roll down the hill.

You might want to put it in gear _and_ block one of the wheels.  I once
managed to leave my Bus in my driveway with the emergency brake off and
out of gear.  I went for parts and a burger in another car and came back
to find my Bus rather closer to the street than I left it.  It rolled
back about 20 feet and stopped on its own; my neighbor across the street
was working on his RV, noticed it, and came over and stuck a chunk of
4x4 under the back tire.

&gt;quick question on greasing the adjusting stars-what do you use for grease-
&gt;do you use a bearing type of grease or a lubricant type stuff(like wd-40)?

I use high temperature wheel bearing grease on the threads.  I don't
think there should be any on the stars themselves.  WD-40 is a solvent,
not a lubricant - it'll help loosen up the stars if they're rusty, but
then you should clean them up and put grease on them.
