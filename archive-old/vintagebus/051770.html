Subject: Re: [T2] carb icing other =?iso-8859-1?q?solutions=3F?=

Richard,

You need to think *lots* bigger than dfroster wire....maybe 12volt water
pipe warmer type wire....lots of amperage draw probably.

And I don't think it would help much anyway...best bet is to fix the heat
riser part of the mainfold, or find a preheat tube and use it to feed
almost all of the intake air with nice heated air...but bad when the
weather warms up...

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hi. I know that the correct way to fix carb icing is to find a manifold with the heat riser tube open, have all the correct air cleaners and so on.
&gt; (This is a 1600 Single port with 009 and 30/31 carb)
&gt; I was wondering if there were any other solutions for someone who has no garage and wants a temporary solution until it's warm and dry enough to do it right. 
&gt;   One of my roommates and I were discussing using some of that heat-wire for a rear window defroster and wrapping that around the manifold below the carb where the ice is the worst. Any thoughts? Anyone who knows better who will stop me before I do something stupid? (I would insulate it electrically from the manifold) Any thoughts and assistance would be appreciated, as the weather now has been rainy and ~40 degrees for a while, and doesn't look like it's stopping any time soon.
&gt; thanks, 
&gt;
