Subject: timing or carb tuning?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

acording to what little information I have, the carb idle ( bocar 34 pict 3) 
should be set before you time, and the timing should be set before you set 
the carb idle, Having just installed a new carb, and having poor timing, I 
need both. Which should I do first to obtain proper setting from the second?

Also, running a 009 I belive that the timing should be at 7.5btdc, Correct? 

My engine code is not in the idiot book(AB I think, it's not here to check), 
is it safe to assume that the two notches on the pully other than top dead 
center are 7.5 and 10 degrees btdc, or might they be atdc? 

Thanks,
Ronnie
