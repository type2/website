NQ didn't post this correctly, he tried to send it at 5:00pm timeframe, I am
sending it now (7:10pm). -- Stephen


 Hello everyone - NQ here - seems like the list dies when all 41 of us in
attendance are not at home poundnig away on the keyboards. :-)
 
 I've had the absolute pleasure of meeting a whole ton of what I personally
consider legendary VW figures.  I'll have one helluva a post to make when I
get home.
 
 As things turned out, the call to Ronnie from the BBB'er in trouble about 3
miles from I95 came through about the time that we were having the raffle.
Rich Kimball with Rusty Bus volunteered his towbar and in the end some guy
named, &quot;Betto&quot; or &quot;Beddo&quot; volunteered to make the run to rescue our stranded
BBB'er.
 
 The whole story is rather devoid of particulars and accuracies (due to my
lack of info) but the fella is being helped as I type.
 
 I gotta start upping the next slew of photos to Steve so I better get
started.
 
 BTW:  I gotta say that it is the weirdest damn feeling to have people come
up to you and know you from your postings on the list.  There are lurkers
out there that have come up to me and introduced themselves as well as the
high profile ones.  It's almost like being a celebrity - something I was
totally unprepared for.  I can only hope that everyone had as much fun
meeting me as I did meeting them.
 
 I got work to do. TTYL!
 
 NQ
