Subject: Suspected electrical problems ?!?!?!?!?!?!

Good Moring List,

Last night I had something really weird happen to my bus.   Hopefully 
someone on the list can lead me in the right direction....   Let me explain 
the situation.

I took the bus into town last night (about a 35 minute drive) and went to 
the store.  On the way into town the bus ran great.  Never missed a beat.  I 
did about 15 or so minutes of shopping and returned to the bus.  Jumped in 
and tried to start it.   The motor just turned over an no fire.  Jumped back 
out of the bus and took a look at the engine.  All the plug wire connected.  
Battery connections good.  Coil connections good.  Distributer connections 
good.  Choke connection good.  Jumped back into the bus and tried to start 
it again.  Absolutely nothing but the engine turning by the starter.  So, I 
went back into the store and picked up a can of starter fluid.  Returned to 
the bus and removed the air cleaner and sprayed some starting fluid in the 
carb.  Jumped into the bus and tried to start it.  Still no fire.  So this 
tells me that it has to be an electrical problem right?  I jump back out of 
the bus and check out the coil.  I remove the battery wire from the coil and 
spark it against the post on the coil (left key on in bus).  Yep, its 
getting power.   So at this point I assume I have a bad coil.  I call the 
wife and she comes to pick me up.  We run out to the parts stash and I grab 
a 6 volt coil and some tools.  We then go back to the bus to change the 
coil.  But, before I change it I decide to try and start it for S&amp;G's.  To 
my amazement the bus starts up.  So we pack up the tools and take off.  Then 
only after about 5 minutes or so of driving the bus seems to loose power 
under load.  It almost seems like someone was removing plug wires.   I would 
let back off the accellerator and the engine would pick back up.  At times 
it got so back I could only get the bus to do 25mph.  The engine never 
backfired only seemed to stumble under load.

So the question is....   What do I need to fix?  What would go back only 
when it is warm and while running cause the engine to stumble.  I now don't 
think its the coil but something in the distributer.   Anyone have some 
experience with this?  Any thoughts would be greatly apprecieated.

Thanks again,
Mike
