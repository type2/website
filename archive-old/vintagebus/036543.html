&lt;&lt; Anyone have any ideas? Is this carb icing? If so, why? I have pre-heat
 connected and manifold riser is burn your fingers hot. Any help

Hi Aaron,
Is the auto or hand choke opening compleatly?  Is the preheat paper tube 
valve working properly?  Do you do mostly non-stop and go driving?  If yes to 
the last two it probably is icing.  The preheat tube only works when the 
valve is unlatched and at idle RPMs.  In really nasty icing conditions 
(Really high humidity and cooler the worst it gets.) it sometime helps to 
just pull over for a couple of minutes.  This allows the engine to idle so 
the intake air valve in the air cleaner closes off most if not all the 
outside air and the engine sucks warm air through the paper preheat tube to 
warm up the carb and upper intake manifold section.  Melting the ice out of 
there!  Eric&amp;Barb
