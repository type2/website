&gt; OK, here are the numbers from the plate behind my front seat.
&gt;
&gt; 25 10 2
&gt;
&gt; 388
&gt;
&gt; KM 231  SK1024   1018295
&gt;
&gt; Iam taking a wild guess and say Oct 25th 1962, don't know the 388 or KM,
but
&gt; the 23 is for Kombi I'm assuming the SK is for colour and the last number
is
&gt; my VIN.  Am I close (I know Horse shoes and handgrenades!!!!)
&gt; Stuart (still learning 'bout buses)
&gt; 63 Kombi ????

Hi,
your right with the date.
388 is an m-code - factory fitted options...  sometimes a whole list of
stuff....   don't know what the 388 option actually is tho- sorry.
KM stands for the port of entry...  K = Canada  M = Montreal
231 = LHD Kombi, loading doors right.
SK = manufacturer of paint...  special mix of sorts prolly... sikkens..  the
others numbers are top/bottom colour.  which = i dunno - i'm not that much
of an anorak ;)
last seven numbers= last seven of your chassis number
hth
