Also be very careful when removing and replacing the TO shaft spring.  If it
flies off you could catch it in the face.  The natural position when working
on the trans with the engine out is to be seated right in front of it in the
engine compartment.  I always try to be off center from the trans and look
away.

The release lever is replaceable.  It's a PITA, but what choice
do you have?  Call up ronnie, have him get you one out ASAP, replace
it Saturday or Sunday, and awaaaayyy you go.
