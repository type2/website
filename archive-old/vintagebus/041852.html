&gt; &gt; the funny part about that site is that some of those vehicles are not in
&gt; &gt; japan,   the green 48 split is the car i sold on ebay for jim anderson, and
&gt; &gt; it is still in LA , and some of the shots look like california to me ???
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe they like to get them sold before shipping to japn? that way maybe
&gt; the new owner will pay for shipping, or they will ahve the money to ship
&gt; it...

Cost of storage might come into it too.  Land is might expensive in Japan.
