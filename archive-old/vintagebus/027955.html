Gee, if you're in Calif for the Classic, why not travel to northern
Calif. (the other Calif) through scenic wine country, very little
traffic, etc., etc., and grace us with your presence: A VW weekend, 6/17
and 18. Show is on the 17th with drive around the lake &amp; BBQ on the
18th. Free swap spaces on 17th. Camping &amp; motels available. Low key
&amp;family oriented show. Mostly stock vehicles with a few mods. Relax.
Mini-vacation. Perfect &quot;Fathers Day&quot; getaway present. Look for our booth
in the swap area at the Vallejo show on the 21st and at Bug-o-Rama on
the 28th.

&gt; Why can't we have something like this in NorCal?  Why must everything be in
&gt; SoCal?
&gt; 
&gt; There's nothing significant in the Sacramento area.  Sure, there's the
&gt; rama, but it's pretty much overrun by the slamed/primer crowd.
&gt; 
&gt; We need a *vintage* meet.  No A-chassis.  No drag racing.  Like a Kelly
&gt; Park, but closer.
