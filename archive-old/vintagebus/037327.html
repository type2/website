 &lt;&lt; fresh air vent-  box sits on top above cab-  look at &quot;a week at he 
 factory&quot; for photos-  there are rows of BDs with this kind of vent.
  
  so this last one would be barndoor only, as it was standard as of 3/55 to 
 have a fresh air vent.     &gt;&gt;
 
 OK, so this is definitely a barndoor only option.  What's the M-code (option 
 code) for it?  Like I said, I'd like to compile a list of Barndoor only 
 options codes and what they are.

well, it's like this- three M codes are listed on the paper I got from the 
factory, one M code was listed as the heavy duty air cleaner, 2 nicht mehr 
identified, but the rack and air vent were factory installed before the 
headliner, so I figure they should have M codes, but I dunno which is which.  
Also have never seen another roof rack like that one, except same style in a 
photo on a split window beetle, and would welcome any info about it anyone 
has.  It is bolted through the roof, not attached at rain gutters with 
clamps.   it does not reach the rain gutters, and is curved with the roof.  
Very sturdy. Not removable unless I rip the headliner and undo whatever holds 
it on from the inside.   I hope to get a digital camera soon, then I can send 
pics, but cannot now.  It was painted the same colour as the top half of the 
bus.
