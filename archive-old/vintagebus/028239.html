Subject: [VB] What Does a Woman look for in a bus?

NQ,

Just bring along some good tunes and a pitcher of Marguerittas for her.
Don't even clean the thing out except maybe dust her seat off a bit and,
oh yeah, wash the windows. Nice clear windows, the tunes and the
beverages. If she wants a spotlessly clean bus, to hell with her. Who
has time for that crapola??!!

Les
