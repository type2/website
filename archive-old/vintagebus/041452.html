&gt; Ditto that - Very good stuff.  I would suggest painting the back of the panel 
&gt; with enamel paint or something to reduce the warping - that is what I did on 
&gt; my second set, it helped.
&gt; 
Ive been using Thompsons water seal on everything from panel backs to
backsides of the furniture and it seems to do very well.
