Here's a couple...  Assign your own numbers!

8&quot; Hemostat - retrieves dropped spark plugs and sockets from Type IV
tin, retrieves dropped rotor from Type I pulley tin
3' 1/4&quot; fuel hose - cut into 3&quot;-6&quot; lengths to install plugs. Also
doubles as a stethoscope for finding unusual engine noises and
sync'ing dual carbs. Can additionally be used as fuel hose.
