I run the Berg pulley.Yes it was $100.Ouch.
But it is a HEAVY turning and does help balance the motor.
I am used to degreed pulleys.(IMHO) It makes timing and valve adjustments
easier ,and more precise.
I was also experiencing blow-by the old pulley(cheap Taiwan brand)
and the Berg Acheiver solved that problem , now it blows out the generator
stand.(DOH)Luckily my new Mexican sp. motor arrived today from Ronnie, so my
64 will be sporting a new heart.( Hopefully in time for BNNTA ! )
    Ronnie also convinced me to go back to a stock exhaust.( I've been using
single quiet packs for years.)He says I will increase my power with the
stock exhaust.
I gonna give it a try.

            See Ya at BNNTA ! Look for the Hawaiian bus !

&gt; Hey list----
&gt; From what I've heard, The Gene Berg balanced degree pulley is the  best
way
&gt; to go if you've got the cash...
&gt; (otherwise stock is always good!)
&gt; My good buddy Neil has one and the word is they are VERY accurate,but, boy
&gt; are they expensive _at_ around 100$ a pop...
&gt; I think a few DBG guys use them also, and are happy w/ them. Those guys
&gt; really drive their busses as do many of the list members! Doesn't Brian
have
&gt; one on his immaculate westy DBG'ers?
