Subject: Re: [VB] Repro taillights.

Save the pieces.   Some folks are happy to drive around with broken glass in 
the round taillights rather than pay for nice new glass.   I had some old 
taillight pieces, and was amazing what people will use.    

Caution: when installing unbroken glass taillight lenses, make sure not to 
tighten the screws too much, or you will crack them in two.

&lt;&lt; sounds like I made a mistake ordering then but I need the lights! Problem 
is I was going to fix the
 existing ones but they are way too rusted to be saved. Glass is broken in 
half on both and the only
 items I could save were seals and chrome rings..... not too pretty but still 
there. Paying almost 50
 green ones for each is not small change either. I could of probably gotten 
some used ones off eBarf
 or Samba but I didn't want to wait. I don't want someone to park in my rear 
just because my lights
 are out... I'm thinking.... should I wait then? all I hear is bad 
experiences with repro ones.....
 
 thanks,
