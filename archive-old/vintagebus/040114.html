I'm not an expert on this, but I agree with them.  The paint really won't 
stick for long in an area that your grabbing on a daily basis.  I've never 
powder coated anything, but with all the talk about it recently, you might 
want to give that a whirl?  Good luck to ya.

&gt;i am hoping to paint my factory black sterring wheel to the correct white
&gt;colour. most places i talk to don't think the paint will stick to well. any
&gt;suggestions?
&gt;
&gt;m.
