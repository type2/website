For the Tranny Gurus,

I agree with Todd on this one. I WILL NOT cut my bus for a mod, but I do
think bolt-on mods are ok to bring her up to date...

Here is my question. I've heard of folks putting SuperBeetle 4th gears
in thier tranny, for the highway. I've also heard that you can put a
beetle tranny in a splitty, if you flip the ring and pinion. Why not
just put a SB tranny in the bus?
