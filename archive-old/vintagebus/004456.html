You are correct the sundial tent poles are meant to mount in the bumper as
you described, at the time the photos were taken on the PLF page we were
unaware of this at the time.  I have also found that having the poles
standing straight down does hold the canvas in place quite well though.

&gt; To the friendly an knowledgeable list members.
&gt;
&gt; The Guy who helped rescue me south of san jose on 101 said my holes (see
&gt; holes posting yesterday) were for sundial.
&gt;
&gt; I searched the archives re. sundial and read about the $250 tent and
&gt; Thom an look up PLF web site and the graphic for the roof mount (which
&gt; mounts with a sheatmetal screw like the kombis) was broken so i just had
&gt; a description.
&gt; the thing that puzzles me is that the PLF sundial tent had no need for
&gt; holes in the bumper overoverriders.
&gt;
&gt; please enlighten me
