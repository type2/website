Subject: Got Gas?
Message-ID: &lt;d06cef3f.24651074_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

friday topic i suppose. I lived in Oregon for a short time and i was aware of
their gas pumping situation, you cannot pump your own gas. Attendant must do
it. I was curious to any stories the list have about how they deal with
this,and anyone ever have an attendant fill their Barndoor up? i dont like
the &quot;law&quot; and if i go back there with my BD i just want to see if there are
alternatives. i am very protective to my investment and dont want any grease
monkeys ripping my decklid off to fill my tank,provided they know where the
filler is in the first place.In my experience, they dont take kindly to you
pumping your own gas, i accidently did it when i first entered OR.No arrests
were made but i got a real dirty look. thanks

Mark
