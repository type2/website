Lots of rhetoric...but as I recall, the case WAS junk, wasn't it?  And you 
wouldn't return the buyer's money, correct?

&gt;Thom, since I inferred that you were referncing your
&gt;latest post to my case that was sold some months ago,
&gt;I felt I should respond. I find it an interesting
&gt;coincidence that the buyer of that case, who slandered
&gt;my name up and down and even broke ebay rules and
&gt;privacy laws in doing so, claims that another item,
&gt;one from well-known Rich Kimball (ovals Only) is
&gt;&quot;Junk&quot; also. Funny in that both items were somewhat
&gt;pricey (above $300), and that the buyer then had some
&gt;remorse over his purchase. Rather than discuss the
&gt;situation civilly, the buyer quickly places a neg.
&gt;feedback, in this case claiming that the Kimballs are
&gt;&quot;Crooks&quot;. Remember that there are always two sides to
&gt;a story, and this story definitely has that. So follow
&gt;the most simplest of rules, 1) read the auction
&gt;description thoroughly BEFORE bidding 2) Ask ANY
&gt;questions BEFORE bidding 3) if you don't feel safe
&gt;with the item description...don't feel compelled to
&gt;bid. And Thom, you have passed your qualifications to
&gt;be an official deputy Ebay sherriff. Keep up the good
&gt;policing ;)
&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Someone has an &quot;nos&quot; 36hp case on ebay right now,
&gt;yet it has the
&gt;oil filler thingy attached (the metal part that screws
&gt;on).  That seems
&gt;highly irregular to me.  I recall another &quot;NOS&quot;
&gt;cosmolene coated case a
&gt;while back that turned out to be junk.  Seller hasn't
&gt;responded yet.
