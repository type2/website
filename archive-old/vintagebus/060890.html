Subject: Re: [VB] Hoover bit/oil cooler seal on DP 1600

Yeah, as John says, I run a long gas line.  I don't
coil it over the trans, though.  I coil or stretch the
extra fuel line in the left &quot;battery tray&quot;.  Does
wonders for hot days here in the desert, because the
fuel is in the cool air flow from the left vent (NO
vapor lock) and I can sometimes pull my engine, do
what I need to do, and put it back without
disconnecting the gas line at all!

Fuel hose is cheap, and I never have a piece that's
too short.

&gt; Scott,
&gt; There is always that little bit that comes out at
&gt; least.  Sometimes more.
&gt; JP runs a long line.  Seemed good to me.  I've
&gt; started doing the same.
&gt; I coil the extra above the transmission.
