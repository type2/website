Subject: Re: [VB] &gt;&gt; strapping down the bus
To: Rhunes29_at_aol_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

i said what i said because i almost had a mishap
only mine could've ended up to be more serious (for the bus i mean)

i was bringing home my 62 crew ,  no suspension at all just bare shell, so i 
had no choice as to where to strap it down.
also it was on a metal dolly that was strapped to the frame.

i put about 6 3&quot; straps on it to my trailer and was on my way, i usually stop 
about half hour later and check all straps to be sure thier tight.
but i didnt get a chance about 20 mins out i hit a good sized dip and i 
looked in the mirror to see the DC popping a wheely so to speak.

well after the visions of my crew skidding down the highway on its belly 
finally left my head i retightened everything and was fine the rest of the 
way.

thats why i say it can never have to many straps.
and when possible on the strong round susp components that you can really 
torque down on.

when i strap mine on it comes down about 2 to 3 &quot; in the susp travel(it aint 
ever coming of again unless i take it off).
