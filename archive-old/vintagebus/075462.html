Subject: Re: 6volt to 12 volt/red dash light bulbs ?

&gt;
&gt;Anyone know of a source for coloured dash light bulbs?   I have a yen
&gt;for red ones for the guages in my 61, to match the dash.  Do you think
&gt;it'll work if I paint the bulbs?

If you can thin the paint out a lot, it might work.  If the gauge has
a little window that the light comes through, you could put a piece of
colored plastic over it, like in a Bus speedometer.  Theaters have sheets
of colored plastic for this purpose called 'gels' which can withstand
the heat of 500 W lamps.

In new cars, the green or orange illumination on the gauges is often
provided by regular clear bulbs with silicone rubber &quot;condoms&quot; over
them.  APM Hexseal seems to be the manufacturer:

For retail sources, check a Ch_at_vy or F_at_rd hot-rod magazine.
