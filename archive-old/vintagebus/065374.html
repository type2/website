Subject: Re: [VB] bus tool box?

In the walk-thru section I just installed in my double cab, that

&gt; looks cool though-  think it's a good idea.   I meant, I know there is crap 
&gt; in the compartment under there, but I never use it.  Probably some neat 
&gt; stuff.  Does anyone actually know what is in the black hole void under the 
&gt; front seats in their bus?
