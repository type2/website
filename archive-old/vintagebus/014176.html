Subject: [VB] front beam question
Message-ID: &lt;19991204050414.80848.qmail_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt;

well fellow vw nuts i decided to keep my split and roll on.so i will asking 
some dumb questions for some of you type 2 guru's but like i said before i 
never had a type 2 before.
  well my 64 kombi needs some suspension updates.my front beam is well wore 
out.i keep hearing that a 68-69 type front beam would fit with no major 
changes.is that true.i was looking at bus boys and the price is the same for 
a adjusted beam weather it is a 67 down king pin or a 68-69 ball joint.and 
if that works i have another question i have a 71 bus beam with disc brakes 
would these spindles and brake hardware fit on a 68-69 front beam,that way 
there i wouldm't have to order the torsion arms and all that for the ball 
joint saying i already have them.last question for the night does anyone 
know if the 71-72 bus 5 lug is the same pattern as porsche wheels.my wife 
really likes the porsche style wheels and if this beam setup will work i 
will let her get some this show season.anyhelp would be great .
thanks everyone for all the help so far.i hope it will continue.
