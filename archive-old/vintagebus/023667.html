Subject: Stainless Steel or Rubber Brake Lines???

I need to replace the current hoses in my '60 crewcab (stock front and
'65 rear) as a couple are &quot;swollen&quot; and barely allow the brake fluid to
pass.  

Do the stainless hoses suffer from this problem with age?
For a street application (bus) would I be just as well off replacing
with new rubber hoses?

Thanks,
Scott
