 B.T.W. if anyone has any used seals form 55-71 I'm interested in purchasing 
 them.
 They don't have to be all that nice.
 Thanks-
 Gregory

FWIW, my 65 has a late bay seal in it, which I cut and spliced in a couple 
bits for the vertical pieces.   The bay engine lid is shorter, but the same 
width.  I didn't glue it in, But it seems the original might have been.
