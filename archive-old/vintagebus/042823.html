  Has anyone had this problem before?  I have a Mexican 1600 with dual
kadrons, 009 dizzy, and stock fuel pump.  It started to run rough on thurs
after a move from my garage to my store.  All the spark plugs were fouled
with carbon. I figured the motor does not like short hops cause it does
not give it any time to burn off the carbon, and that it needed a good
highway cruise.  I replaced the plugs, wires, rotor, cap and adjusted the
valves.  Also, I found the accelator linkage was put on the outside of the
cradle underneath and I put it back in its place and now have more pedal.

 Now it starts, but when I pull the spark plug wires on the 1&amp;2 cylinders
there is no change in rpm's.  The plugs wires one 1&amp;2 do spark when held
near metal.  Starting fluid down the throat of the kadron for 1&amp;2 does not
give any change.  When I pull the spark plugs 3&amp;4 are clean and 1&amp;2 are
black. I figure if I switch carbs on each side that will be my next
troubleshooting step.  Any other ideas?

Best,
joe
