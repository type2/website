Subject: 15&quot; tires, Yokohama Geolandar 215/75/15 - all say too big!

Ok,

So I'm getting the impression that I goofed. 215/75/15 is too large by all
the replies I'm getting.  But I also see why I ran into this problem.   A)
there is a legend of too many tire threads on the list, so I didn't ask :)
B) Archive searches revealed conflicting info as to 165 or 195 being the
&quot;stock size&quot; for 4.60 x 15&quot; .  I followed the 195 size -- but now believe
that the metric conversion actually comes out closer to 165 (slightly less
in fact).  Can someone confirm this?

Another thought -- one of the attractions I had to the beefy tires is that I
could go on a few winter trips and deal with snow.  A cross country drive to
Chicago area...

Having a better understanding of the fact that my 215's are too big... I now
realize that my winter snow experience often lead to snow building up in the
wheel well, often turning into ice.  The lack of clearance on the rear part
of the wheel well is bound to make these tires a problem.

Gary Gibson wrote to me that 50 PSI in the front would cause understeer.  I
work in a place that has an underground parking garage, and I drive three
floors like a spiral staircase.  I like how these tires feel.  (remember, I
only put them on front)  They actually take the turns a little more crisp.
From Gary's comment, this is bad?

P.S.  At least I purchased only two ;)
