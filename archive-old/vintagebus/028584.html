My Thoughts... limited as they may be

1.) Re Andrew lament earlier... Buses are also cuter than just about 
everything else out there... I guess style takes that in.  I would add to 
his comments that perhaps it is a longing look to a better time... perhaps 
not in reality but in our desires.  If more felt this way it might actually 
become a part of the way society works.  So much for philosophizing.

2.) Drivers of SUVs are suffering from a loss of contact with the driving 
experience.  The vehicles, due to size, soft suspension, big tires and to 
much sound insulation, do not &quot;feel&quot; the speed they are traveling.  They do 
not monitor the speedometer but go by how fast they &quot;feel&quot; they are going.  
A recent, documented study showed that an SUV driver felt that a 65 mph 
speed was only 45 mph... so they drove faster to adjust to how fast they 
thought they were going, conciously or otherwise.  Driver of other cars (or 
older in this case) were much more apt at interpreting their perceived speed 
to that reported by their instruments.

3.)  The soft suspension on the SUVs yields very dangerous handling 
characteristics which may surprise the &quot;unaware&quot; driver in critical 
situations.  My neighbor, for example, has an airbag suspension on his 
Expedition... wallows like a pig is his description.  This is made worse by 
the driver/owner/whatever not paying attention to the load limits on these 
vehicles and going, once again, by their intuitive view: big beast... big 
load.  Again, handling goes to hell.

4.) A 4-wheel drive!!!  I'm invulnerable!!!  A symptom reported by my 
brother driving BIG trucks in Oregon and by many he hangs with.  He has told 
me many a story of being passsed by SUVs on I5 between Eugene and Portland 
spinning like tops with the drivers looking very confused.  Other tales 
abound of SUVs down embankments in the hills because they didn't think you 
could slide a 4x4.... hmmm.  Truckers are not saints but they do see alot 
more of this than the more casual drivers among us.  Finally, a friend of 
the family, a CHP (California Highway Patrol) regional supervisor has 
pitched in on this and not on the side of SUVs.

5.) Better mileage?  I don't think so unless he is driving a Honda CRV 
(which I do happen to like) or Suziki (which I don't like) class vehicle and 
even then it will come down to driving style.  The CRV is a 2.2l as I recall 
and gets around 25-30 mpg as my coworker reports... heck my bug does that 
without being particularly attentive to the weight of my foot.  Or perhaps 
someone else should have been tuning his Bus?

Don't get me wrong... I like trucks and I can see a purpose for SUVs, just 
not in the general population.  Course, the amount of groceries my Wife 
hauls home regularly does require the use of a truck... hmmm :-/

This fellow is obviously feeling harassed either directly or otherwise and 
for that I am sympathetic... but maybe he should listen up or stop doing 
things that make him feel guilty?
