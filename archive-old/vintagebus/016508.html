That is a major part of negotiating a field-find; you can't show your hand!
If you appear too enthusisatstic, then they think they're getting the short 
end of the stick.  It's tough to do!  When I was pulling those three
buses out of the hills last fall, I put on the front like I was doing him
a favor, and that I might be able to get some parts from the buses.
When I pulled my '55 out of the hills, not once did I mention the word
&quot;westfalia&quot; or &quot;rare&quot;

By bugging him so much, you've tipped your hand.  The best thing to do
would be to lay off for a few days.  Also, don't tell too many other people
about it, *especially* locals - you don't want competition.

It's kinda like dealing with women.  If you call a lot, you sound desperate.
If you don't call, they'll be waiting by the phone wondering why you don't call,whic makes you more desirable.

&gt; seem nearly as eager. Bugger, I hope that some well meaning idiot hasn't
&gt; gone and filled his head with ideas about parting some bus lover from a heap
&gt; of cash.
