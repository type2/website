Subject: Re: [VB] dual M/C brake upgrade- where does the &quot;T&quot; go?

Chris-

I just put a new MC on my 67 and the line for the fronts goes up from the MC
a couple of inches and then turns to go back from the MC only about 4&quot;
before it comes to the &quot;T&quot;.  I do not believe the T is supported, but I did
not look that closely. If you like, let me know and I'll crawl under.

Bob

&gt; I'm doing a dual circuit upgrade on my brakes for my '65. So of course
&gt; I'm adding a &quot;T&quot; in the front to split the line from the M/C.  Where
&gt; should the front &quot;T&quot; go?  Since its a '65 I'm guessing there's no hole
&gt; for the T to be.  Anyone out there with a '67 that can tell me where its
&gt; supposed to be on a '67?
&gt;
