Dave,

That's what I don't know.  I would bet there were the
two on either side of the fresh air box, and I'm
guessing there is one about over where the divider is,
but I can't seem to figure out if there was one at the
back over the back window.

&gt; 
&gt; Were there others????  The parts book seems to lack
&gt; detail in this area.

&gt; a
&gt; couple of the full width strips they would like to
&gt; sell?  I have the two for on either side of the
&gt; fresh

&gt; For help leaving the list, send a HELP message to
