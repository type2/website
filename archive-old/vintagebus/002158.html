Subject: Re: Crank out Windows

&gt;I have crank out windows on my '65.  They are hinged on the top, and I
believe they are manufactured by Hehr. They have this written on them:
&gt;HEHR:l-2186
&gt;
&gt;The PO told me the company was still around, and that they were located
somewhere in Norhtern California I think. He had replaced two of the cranks.
I am trying to find the gaskets for these windows.
&gt;Any ideas where I might find these?
&gt;

I haven't been there in a few years, but my 63 had them and I used to get
them at an RV shop in Mesa, AZ called Isley's. They sold parts and complete
assemblies out of bins along the wall. They were an off the shelf RV window,
appropriately enough. They may have had them simply cause they were an old
run-down RV place, or they may still be available. Check old run-down RV
stores if you got 'em. Might get lucky and buy a hundred, then you can sell
them to listees for a hugely inflated price with a list discount.
