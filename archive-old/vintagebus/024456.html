Subject: Loose head

Hi y'all
Got a good one.  As you might recall, I recently replaced a head on the
Tinkertoy.  Was driving home the other night and I experienced a loss of
power, increased exhaust noise, and a general clatter.  Not a good sign,
as last time I heard those noises I ended up replacing the head on the
left side.  Sure as cats chase mice when I applied my torque wrench to
the head nuts under the rocker shaft the head needed a retorque.

Within 500 miles of installation.

1600sp, stock stock stock except for remote oil cooler/filter setup a-la
the rantings and a pertronicks ignitor in a 009 dizzy.

I drive mostly in town, occasional highway runs, even sometimes up to 55
mph!  Oil temp remains below 220 degrees.

I could invest in Locktite, BUT that shouldn't be necessary.  There's no
evidence of the studs pulling out of the case.

Any thoughts?  I'm about stumped why it's just this head on this side.
