Subject: Yellow L-codes &amp; tranny?

I know this is riding that line of non-vintage comtent, but it IS a
holiday, kinda like Friday material...  So here are the L codes for the
yellows that have been discussed:

Sierra Yellow: ???
MArino Yellow: L20A
Bali Yellow: ???
Brilliant Orange: L20B

Now, for some vintage content.  I have a '65 Sundial that I've been
thinking of putting a T4 in.  I'd like a bit more speed.   I've also
thought about putting the 3.88 R&amp;P in it instead, but that sounds like a
lot of work, as there are no shops in my area (Indiana) that do this sort
of thing, and I've heard horror stories about messing with VW trannies.
So has anyone done either of these things?  I've been told that the T4
would probably put too much stress on the redux box tranny, due to the
increased torque.  Any thoughts?

Thanks,
