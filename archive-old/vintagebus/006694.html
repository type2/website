Let's see now, I have never driven my bus without the racks on so I might be
missing something, empty (except my spare tire) I average 20 plus MPG,
loaded with 2 sets of middle and rear seats and pulling the trailer I
averaged 16-17 MPG, but I couldnt say if it was the 4 foot high stack of
seats or the trailer that affected my gas mileage. If you come down with a
rack and decide you didn't like the performance of your bus when you get
here, I will gladly take it off your hands.

ps. The all country busavan leaves Havasu for the Classic weekend at 6 am
tomorrow, So far people are here from Washington ( a round about way to the
Classic), JP and Berry from New Mexico should be rolling in soon, don't know
if the Colorado contingent is going to make it or not, so look for 6 buses
cruising west down I 10 .

Had anyone noticed a significant degredation in performance when travelling
with a roof rack?
