Hi Edselflop,
We would do a full tune up, and replace the 009 with a vacuum advance 
distributor that was used by VW with your carb.  If you still need to install the bug 
engine in the bus you will need to change the oil bath air cleaner to the bus 
one, install a bus muffler, then change the jetting of the carb for a bus 
engine.  You will have problems getting the upper left engine mounting bolt 
secured, that should work as long as you do not take it 4x4ing.  The only other 
problem could be that you will need to change the FW to fit your earlier 6 volt 
bus tranny that took the slightly smaller diameter FW or grind out the tranny 
bellhousing to fit the later 12 volt FW.
  No engine sheetmetal should be needed to be changed!  The doghouse shroud 
and cooler does help #3 cylinder not to run so hot and fail so often, we have 
run that type of cooler on 40 HP thru 1641cc engines so far.  Just make sure to 
use the proper sized cooling fan and lower pulley for doghouse cooling.
