Subject: driving again

yesterday i installed the new starter and cranked the single cab over.  felt good, sounded good.  today i swapped beetle for truck.  felt even better, ran great.  i've not driven my truck since i got back from albuquerque and i was missing it.  so today we took a romantic drive in second gear along the coast and up into the pines.  i had some errands to run so we did them together.  each time i came back, it started right up - quick too.  &quot;okay mom, i'm ready.  let's go.&quot;  i haven't taken the 36-horse engines out of the bed yet.  i figured that they are prolly seeing more action than they've seen in a few years and appreciated the ride as much as my truck appreciated getting out on the road, as much as i appreciated being able to sit up in the cab and go someplace.  the sky was really great.  a storm is rolling in.  the sky was a meaningful mixture of gray and black.  the air was sharp and laden with potent.  pine needles were flying through the air like insects in the summer.  the crows were having a hard time flying straight.  it was an awesome day.  i was glad to be able to share part of it with the truck.  i saw a number of other vintage and unusual cars out driving around today; it kind of surprised me given the threat of a strorm.  my truck was definitely the ugliest though.  that fact made me feel good in a perverse way.  it sure feels great driving my truck again.

In a new car, you're just going somewhere;                                
in a Volkswagen you ARE somewhere. -Stormy Henderson's Dad
