 &gt;  I drove from near Cheyenne Wyoming to 6 miles short of Tonopah, NV on
 battery.   th eradio/tape player sounded funny, so kept it off.  When it
 got dark and I turned the headlight on, the engine stalled out.   We read
 the Idiot book in the morning, and diagnosed worn out gen brushes.  Push
 started it and drove into town and bought some brushes and changed them.
 Pushed started it again, and it began charging.
 &gt; Driving  where you stop and start the bus, or using headlights and tape
 player, it won't last as long.
 &gt; You can remove a battery from a bus with a generator while it is
 running, and it will keep running.

If you run that long with bad brushes in a generator, you have likely
severely pitted the commutator.  You can replace the brushes and the
generator will then work, but the brushes will wear out very fast.  At
least that was my experience when I did it.

My solution was to replace generator with alternator.
