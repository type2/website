&lt;&lt; Yesterday I took a little 20 mile jog to the west to some land a friend of
 my brother's bought.  We did a little target practice and tore around the
 field in our little golf carts.  I didn't push the bus this time,
 maintaining about 55 to 60 with a moderate NW headwind (What is it about
 these confounded headwinds???)  The temp was fine.  Coming home, I found a
 nice secluded black top and the bus and I hit a record high of 75 mph.  I
 didn't feel like pushing it anymore than that.  I was doing about 65 the
 rest of the way on the highway and just as I got outside Beatrice, the temp
 light came on again.  But as soon as I got into town and started driving in
 3rd gear, all was well.
 
 So this raises a couple of questions that I would like to ask some of you.
 I know this 1600 is getting a work out pulling the bus with it's freeway
 flier trans and tall 15&quot; tires.  It really makes this bus scoot along but
 I'm well aware that VW knew that to pull a certain load, the engine was
 going to have to turn at a certain RPM throughout it's operating range in
 order to keep the engine cool.  Will my 1776 with Berg sump, full flow
 oiling, 40IDF's, and T4 oil cooler be able to handle this load without
 overheating (anyone out there with real world examples?) or will my
 overheating likely continue due to decreased RPM's at 4th gear speeds?

actually, I find that my bus cools better at 3K than at 3500rpms, (seems to 
cool best around 50mph (2600).   I don't know that this means your motor has 
the same optimal cooling rpms, but it would be interesting to know.  

you can check for yourself by driving on the flat at each speed after the bus 
has warmed up, stay at say 50 for ten minutes, then go to 55, ten mins, then 
60, ten mins, 65, what are your temps?  so you know where your bus runs 
coolest.  Find your optimal cooling speed.  There is a curve between heat 
produced by engine, which goes up with rpms, and cooling from fan, and at 
some place the extra heat produced is more than the extra cooling produced by 
the higher rpms.

do you have a guage, or just one of those dipstick things that flash when the 
oils over 225?

Have no idea of knowing how hot the fat motor will run. in terms of temp.  
every motor seems slightly different.  It would evidently have more power to 
pull the hills with the high gears.  I found the typeIV cooler thing 
definately a good thing.

I would go ahead and try it out.  Also, did you put in new engine to body 
seal and  seal off holes in tin etc and good engine compartment seal.   
having that sealing really helps pressurize your engine compartment while 
your bus is in motion, and sends more air through the cooling system.

I have looked through owners manauls for numbers sometimes fruitlessly.  Like 
my 69 bug owners manual  says max/cruising speed is 78 mph.  (4.37 R&amp;P, .89 
4th, 1500motor), but most efficient speed is 60mph.    but it does not 
quantify efficent, like efficent in terms of not wearing out motors?  as in 
terms of gas milage?  who knows.  and no where does it says what rpms are at 
what speed.  Someone suggested that the top speed was at the highest part of 
the power range of the motor, but I don't know one way or another, so i want 
to tach the bug to see (cause it does have it's original tranny) what that 
means in terms of what VW said.   but 

how this means your motor will be cool I don't know.  Like people say you 
have to keep the rpms up, but there is no quantification.   Don't drive at 
1,500 rpms in 4th,  some people do that, cause they dont think they should 
hear the motor at all.  Like goldilocks and the three bears, you want not too 
much, not too little.

how hot was it on this trip?

its going to run hotter into a headwind.  
it';s going to run hotter up hill.  it's just more work.
