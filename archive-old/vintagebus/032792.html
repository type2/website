Subject: Re: [VB] POR15 or what?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

again, someone yesterday answered that you shouldnt por15 your brake drums.
and i agree with them.  por15 puts on a hard thick coating it cant possibly 
dissapate heat well.
a good black high temp paint ( barbaque paint) is a good choice, i find that 
this sometimes out lasts the big name high temp paints.

also about por15 , the company states that it adheres to rust, so it dosent 
make sense to just slop the stuff over everything (over painted surface) 
because it just isnt going to do anything. unless the por15 is in direct 
contact with the metal, it isnt sealing or doing its job correctly.

also you have to use the metal prep , they have on the rust , to nutralize it 
and it put a zinc posphate coating on it that converts the rust to a gray and 
black neutralized metal.     then you can por15 over and permanatly seal it.

just slopping it on over everything, your just wasting the por15 and not 
really protecting the metal the correct way.

well i got that of my chest, now i have to go por15 my creww.
