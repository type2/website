&lt;&lt; Hi All,
 
 Is the inside rear view mirror different for a 65ish bus and a 59????
 I need one for my 59 and found one from a 65-66.
  &gt;&gt;
the 65 and later buses have bigger rear view mirrors.   They also tend to 
have larger back windows, perhaps there is a connection.  Though you may say 
the bigger back window showed up in 64, evidently it took VW a year to 
realise a larger rearview mirror would help.   Neverthless, the mirror should 
screw on the same, though the extra mirror won't help, unless you have a 
deluxe.
