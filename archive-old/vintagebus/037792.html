Subject: '66 Westy FOR SALE in NC
Message-Id: &lt;9907151214.ZM6351_at_eos.ncsu_dot_edu&gt;

Howdy all. A friend of mine is selling his '66 hardtop Westy to finance his
move to Colorado. The interior is nearly perfect, although it's missing the
cabinet on the cargo door. I helped build the engine, and it's got less than
2000 miles on it, so that's definitely good for a long time. Drivetrain is in
good shape, as are brakes. He bought it from a mechanic, who drove it &amp; fixed
it up, then sold it without the engine to my friend.
Anyway, it's a good solid bus, although recently it has had some minor wiring
glitches. Nothing a few hours and a wiring diagram won't fix, I'm sure. It also
will need 4 new tires.
Body is very straight, has front and rear bumpers, and about a five year old
velvet green paint job, with some body work at that time. It has some rust
since then, but nothing bad.
It's in Raleigh, NC, and he's asking $3500, which is VERY negotiable. He really
has to sell it in the next 2 weeks, as he's leaving at the end of the month.
Feel free to call Scott at 919-832-3691 and discuss it. He wants it to go to a
good bus home. With new tires and an afternoon of wiring, it's drivable
anywhere in the US...
