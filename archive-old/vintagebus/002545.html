Subject: shift rod bushing
Date: Tue, 15 Aug 2000 15:49:28 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I'm trying to replace my shift rod bushing and it isn't going very well.  So
it seems that my bus never had a shift rod bushing for the last 3000 miles.
I guess if felt sloppy but ..... other than the occasional popping outta
forth (which hasn't happened in a long time)  it seemed to shift OK.

So my 60 standard only has one shift rod bushing right?  And it should be in
the same way as those in the 63-67 bently pictures - right?

One of the set screws had already been broken off and I broke off the
remaining one (from the front coupling) now I'm stuck - I've drilled out the
pieces of the screws but everything is siezed up.  I heated the coupling and
tried twisting it with 2 pairs of vice grips and not luck.

So, now Ive sprayed loosen stuff on it and I'll give it some time.  I really
don't want to cut or grind anything but ...... I may have to.

TIA
