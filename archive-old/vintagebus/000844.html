Subject: Cylinder Fin casting &amp; Case Question

I was re-installing the head on my AVP rebuilt today and noticed something
curious.  On one of the cylinders, there is a web running down the length of
the cylinder fins from the head end to the case end.  This web is on both
the top and bottom side fins and extends all the way to the edge of the
fins.  All the other cylinders have what look like remnants of the same
thing, but the #4 has full webbing.  I seem to recall reading somewhere (the
sermons?, damn can't go there) that this web should be removed, is this the
case?

Which leads me to my next question.  On the case, there is no identifying
number under the generator tower, instead there is a stamping on the top of
the case next to the split.  The stamping is next to a VW trademark with the
number T0150810.  What kind of case is this and should I be worried about
poor quality?

Thanks a bunch,
