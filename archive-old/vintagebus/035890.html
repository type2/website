(Put on your James Brown,.......)

It feels good.  I knew that it it would, now
It feels   nice,  like sugar and spice...

So GOOD !!! SO NICE!!!

That bus has a wonderful vibe.  It's my friend.
Hopefully you all can see it at Kelley Park in a couple months, look for the 
og paint SWR/BG corner window bus , no sunroof,  old faded paint, rocker rot, 
old bondo behind drivers door (vintage bondo- over 25 years old), roof rack, 
one safari window, WA plates, original interior panelling.    Maybe I'm just 
a sucker for SWR dashes.

 &gt;Got my 61 started again. I really like this bus.   Finally got all the
 tranny 
 &gt;bits and all sorted out and installed  with nice axle shafts and fulcrum 
 &gt;plates and NOS shift bushings and rubber dust covers both ends of the tube
