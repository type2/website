&lt;&lt;  &gt;Did VW change the headlight switch from the foot switch to the
    &gt;switch in
    &gt;the turn signal assembly in 66 or 67?
  
  From what I've learned over the last month, converting my 1960 6 volt
  truck to a 12 volt with a 67 westie harness (thanks Shawn), they put a
  relay in the 6 volt circuit around 65, and controlled it with the turn
  signal/dimmer switch.

hm??
first of all, there is no need to change the wiring harness to convert from 
6V to 12V.
hm?
there is an emergency flasher relay put in when the bus got the BRL on the 
dash. This is in addition to the turn signal relay.
the 9 pin black box was introduced in 66.  this box did lots of stuff that 
blinks.    It hooks up lots of wires from the turn signal assmebly, and 
incorparates the highbeams.  Meaning as of 66 you got a 9 pin box and no 
groovy footswitch .
......
The footswitch went away. Then around 66, they
  switched to a 12 volt relay.

well, more as of the 67 model year they went to 12 V, unless you had that 
rare pre 67 12V option....

I wanted to keep the original foot switch and
  turn signal switch, so I wired the headlamps direct to the footswitch (a
  la 1960) and eliminated the relay. This reminds me, has anyone ever
  shorted out the wires under the footswitch to the metal on the floor? Is
  there supposed to be some kind of insulator there? The odd thing about the
  light circuit is the running lamps are not fused, nor is the headlamp
  switch. Could be trouble if a direct short occurred behind the dash.
   &gt;&gt;

I had a short behind the pod in my 65 westy years ago and it melted the wires 
to the front running lights.  :(   believe it was because of the switch on 
the left of the pod (rear dome light) had a hot wire come loose, this was 
very soon after I started driving the bus, and I was in downtown seattle and 
smoke came out of the dash eek!!!!!

now I have intermittant headlights, rather it seems a bad footswitch.  so 
difficult to change you know.   I forget about it though.  I carry a spare in 
my purse.  :)
