Subject: Stripped oil pressure switch?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Sorry for the double messsage.  It appears as though
my  case has a stripped oil pressure switch threads. 
It's leaking like crazy now that I removed the old one
that was in there for I don't know how long.  Does
anyone have any advice?  Thanks again, --J
