Are you saying that you can't tell the R&amp;P without taking off parts of the
transaxle?

If so, this isn't true... If you search the archives you will find that I
documented a method of determining the gear ratio by jacking up 1 wheel and
couting the number of Turns of engine pully to wheel.  The numbers come out
in such a way that it is pretty easy to figure it out.

I put together a web page back in January...

The size of your tires do not matter for this test, you take the tire off :)

  I dont really understand the math, and also speedos can be slightly off
esp 
if the tires are not exactly stock size.   I had tached my 61 (big nuts, 
15&quot;rims, 205 75 15 tires) and of course at the time did not know the r/p as 
it is not visible in a driving bus.     I say impossible to know from 
outside, cannot assume is original to year in there, also that was not the 
original  trans, but a $35 swap meet score.   only can know r/p  w/o looking

in side if a split case which has one choice.
