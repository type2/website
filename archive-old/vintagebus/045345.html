Subject: Re:  [VB] 62-67 deluxe panel compatibility?
To: jelm2_at_yahoo_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

in july 62 they changed the shape of the spare tire bulge behind the front 
seat.  They did this at the same time they switched the wheel wells to flare 
a tad in the rear, the later doglegs in the front, and went to the 1/3 2/3 
seat.

So, if the 62 deluxe that the paness are from is a really late 62 with a 1/3 
2/3 front seat, they will fit. If it is the full width seat bus, the bunlge 
is different, and the panels that go on it are too.

Hi.
DARTHVW is a 67 non-walk-thru deluxe sunroof bus.

Well, I need the three panels which cover the spare
tire hump on the passenger side of the cab divider.
There's a set on the internet I'm looking at, from a
62 deluxe.
From the pics, the center portion (the part which
sticks out and makes that little shelf) looks a bit
longer and/or narrower than the center section piece I
have in my bus (I only have the top shelf piece, it
has a thick rubber rim around the top, like dash
grabhandle material) the one from the 62 looks like it
has aluminum around the top of the shelf lip instead. 
Is that right?

I just want to make sure if I get this set, that the
hole for the '62 shelf will line up with the mounting
holes in my cab divider.
