Hey all,

        Yup.....the numbers are still shooting up daily on T2'ers out there
that have an American camper conversion and have no idea for sure who did
it.  Sundial is the ONLY non-Westy camper manufacturer  that we have
confirmed what the interior looks like.

        RustyVanBondo (SKA Jim Ellis) claims to have an EZ camper brochure
that came with his &quot;confirmed&quot; EZ camper.  After almost a year of begging
for any info to be shared by Mr. Ellis, I am again requesting anyone that
knows &quot;for sure&quot; what an EZ camper (or any other non-Westy)  looks like on
the inside to check out these pix that I have gathered up of American
camper conversions.  The Sundial, as you will see, is pretty easy to
identify (badges).

        Lets work together to get rid of this damn &quot;EZ/Sundial&quot;
autosignature that is turning into a silly standard.
