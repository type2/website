&lt;&lt; Should I have a spring between the end of my accelerator cable and the fan

We found after repairing all the wear and tear on the forward linkage that we 
still needed a second return spring on the cable itself.  Made the pedal much 
firmer and this causes less ankle strain from trying to keep the pedal up 
from the floor for long periods.
Check you carb's accellerator pump linkage to make sure it is not rubbing 
against the generator!  It is loosen the carb from the intake manifold and 
slip the carb away from the generator.

&lt;&lt;The process I did was to pull the cable tight and screwed it down. Was this 
incorrect? &gt;&gt;
No.  You want to pull it tight and then let out about 1/32-1/16&quot; of an inch 
of the cable.  Then have a helper or your tool/ammo box push the gas pedal 
all the way down.  So you can check to make sure you throttle arm is at least 
or a bit more than 1/32&quot; away from it's stop.
