Subject: Re: [VB] industrial bumbers

&gt; i located some bumbers, the guy has no pics and he is calling them &quot;industrial bumbers&quot;, he said they were offered as an accesory in 63, does someone know what hes referring too?
&gt; is there a pic of this somewhere on the web?
&gt;
Perhaps &quot;Hurst bumpers&quot; aka &quot;Bull Bars&quot; aka &quot;Cow Catchers&quot; aka &quot;Industrial bumpers(?)&quot;

Check the lower left on this page:

The psycho Bus parts market puts the value on these bad boys at like $1000, crazy kids.
