Subject: RE: [VB] windshield seal failure

Don; I took a 1 1/2 inch slice on my first one using the same technique it
appears that you are using.  I found two things that made the difference.
First was having somebody applying pressure from the outside in the same
area I was pulling the string.  The second is being careful of the angle
when you pull the string.  When you start to feel it get tight, change the
angle of the pull; try moving your hand towards the outside circumfrence
versus perpendicular to the glass.

Patience is the big thing (although doing it in 45 degree weather probably
doesnt help much I imagine).  After the first one, mine went much easier.  I
did 7 over the course of a couple of days a year or so ago on my '67.  The
rear window was a REAL bugger!!

Today I trashed my new passenger window seal trying to install it.  I
had read tons of posts, and thought I had everything set.  The tar
alone apparently did not lubricate the cord and inner lip of the seal
enough, as my 2mm (.080 inch) round weedeater wire I had laying around
started slicing through the seal about half way through.  Nice clean
slice about 3 inches long.  I know Bentley recommends 3-4mm wire,  so
I'll try switching to that, and also lube it up with some dish soap.
I'm also considering using a blow dryer to heat up the rubber as I go
around, as I'm doing this in the garage in 45 degree weather.   I take
total blame for today's setback, as I know I was rushing.
