Subject: Charging two batteries-for Norcold fridge

I want to add a second battery to ONLY run my Norcold fridge via 12v on
the road. I plan to run 8guage wire or fancy stereo wire from battery
with large stereo fuse housing. Fridge already has dual system switch.

A) What do I need to do to simply charge the second battery from the
alternator? No need for car or accessories to run or start from it.

B) Does anyone have run time experience with a Norcold hooked up this
way?
Thanks
