&gt;&gt; Check this picture I saw on Thoms site.  It is a factory accessory ad for
&gt; racks.  It shows a very interesting antenna placement on a factory safari
&gt; equipped bus.  The antenna is mounted above the left rear tail light.
&gt; Anyone have this placement?  Would it be correct?  I guess since antennas
&gt; were usually dealer installed any place would be correct...no?

I plan to mount mine, passenger side just behind the door.  I'm just
deciding on single our double mount.  When I got it it was mounted on the
roof.

If it's worth doing, it's worth doing
