Subject: 67 bus update
Date: Mon, 27 Mar 2000 21:34:16 -0600

I didn't get much tonight - just about an hour's worth of work because I'm
tired and am going to turn in soon.  I went with my grandfather tonight to
look at a 1919 Model T that a guy has for sale.  They were sure neat cars.
They make even the most spartan of bugs look like a Caddy/BMW/Rolls/etc.
They guy wanted more than what my grandfather was willing to pay.  Just like
the new bug, the cars have went from a necessity or utilitarian type vehicle
to a novelty and the price reflects that.

Moving on, I had left a fan running in the bus for about 24 hours to help
the por15 cure.  It cured alright - tough as nails.  I put the seat back in,
put in the gear shift and adjusted it, and installed the seat belt on the
driver's side.  I had to sit there for a few minutes and spin around the AM
dial on the old sapphire.  Man I love that little radio - it's like a little
time machine - I turn it on and it's little warm glow sends me back to a
time that I never existed in.  Must have been fun...  One little fact I
found out about the gear shift while I think about it.  A shifter from a 66
bus won't work in a 67 bus and I presume it's the same the other way around.
The spring is a tad shorter on the 66 shifter for one thing but the main
reason is that the piece that sticks down in the socket is shorter on a 66
than on a 67.

Next I slid underneath the front of the bus.  Every pivot and joint on the
linkages has grease or oil or the remnants thereof.  Things are just
starting to dry out in places.  As for rust-through in the frame, floor,
cross member - lots of surface rust but nothing that is rusted clear
through.  I'm thoroughly impressed at how straight this midwest bus is.
Even so, there is plenty of body work to tackle but still,  I'm one lucky
guy to have found it.

I also found where someone has spliced a wiring loom just as the wires exit
the body and head towards the rear of the bus.  Problems here - massive
black tape special.  No crimp joints at all - now I can see why I'm having
some intermittant tail light problems.  I've decided to leave this alone
until I get over to my grandfather's shop and get all the unions crimped
properly.  It's a mess.

Last of all, I had my dear ol' mother sit in the bus and turn the wheel side
to side while I watched underneath.  This verified that all 4 ball joints
are shot, both ends of the drag link are worn out, but surprisingly, the
grease-caked center pin (swing arm) showed very little play.  It evidently
has been kept lubed.  It is more than coincidence that all non-zerk parts
are shot but the ones with zerks are still good?  You can bet I'll be
hunting for zerk equipped ball joints and if I can't get them, I'll drill,
tap, and zerk them myself.

End of update.

Extra Note:  Kind of had a bombshell dropped on me today.  I drove 120 miles
one way (had to get up at 5:30 this morning) and unloaded half of a
semi-trailer full of windows and doors for the lumber yard.  I met with one
of the managers from a neighboring lumber yard (about 70 miles from
Beatrice) and inquired about his yard foreman that I knew only as 'Bob.'
Bob had lost a lot of weight and quit smoking due to a heart attack he
suffered about 2 years ago.  He seemed to be doing well afterwards and we
had gotten to know each other after delivering goods to each other's yard
over the past 3 years.

Bob died and was buried February 17th after suffering a massive stroke while
he was opening up the lumber yard one morning.  He lasted 6 days after that
before his body shut down.  Bob was 46.

There are things learned from situations such as this.  I know what I've
learned.  Bob reminded me a lot of myself in several ways and although we
weren't close, he was still someone I knew and visited with when we bumped
into each other.  With him gone, you can bet I'll notice it next time I
travel to the Ashland, NE lumber yard.

Well - that's it for this batch of rambling.  Time for bed....
