for anyone who wants to bend their brains
   see if you can figure this out:

Put my bus back together with rebuildt tranny -  While the tranny was
switched, the engine end play was reset- it was previously .008&quot;, and was set
to .0035&quot;- the acceptable range being .003 to .005, so it wasn't that bad
before.   Put in new main seal and FW O ring, and rejetted the 30/31 pict
carb, and put in a thermostat and a couple small bits of missing tin.

 since then it has had cetain symptoms it did not before:

The oil pressure has dropped somewhat (I have a guage), and even tends to come
on
at idle after  20 minutes + driving.

It is running cool, however.  No where close to overheating, No oil temp guage
though.

also, it is a friggin slug.   There are hills I don't expect to pull in 4th,
but when it's hard to keep speed in 3rd it is worrying.   Yes it was switched
to a 3.875 from a 4.125 r&amp;p in the tran, but it should be perkier than this.
I have no idea how many miles this engine has on it.    It is a B case 1600
SP- has atleast 30,000K I know of.  However, it seemed pretty perky ( not new,
but definately servicable) before, and suddenly slugola. The timing is
advancing properly.   The gas milage is poor, as it has always been with this
motor, about 17 mpg.  Where is my 23.5 mpg the book promised me?  oh well.

in a couple days I'll tell you what happened- but please go ahead and guess.
