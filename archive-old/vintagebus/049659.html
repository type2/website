Subject: RE: [VB] RPM/Speed/gears

&gt;Do you have a ton of other gizmos in the bus? Like a slammin' stereo, or
&gt;lots of gauges, or extra lights?
&gt;I've found that any or all of the above can drastically change tach
&gt;readings, fwiw.

&gt;I do not have any Gizmo's in the bus, just the Tach. It is wired in per VDO
&gt;instructions useing there sheilded wire etc.Idle is at 800 rpm cold and goes
&gt;up to 1000 when warmed up. I contribute that to the Kadrons and there
&gt;linkage. I do have hard driving habits but didn't know what they were till
&gt;now and do contribute the excessive rpm's to the tranny gearing and the
&gt;engine in the bus,but it works and has gotten me 1000's of miles, all fully
&gt;loaded down. If all was stock I wouldn't get near what I do. I know driving
&gt;the old 40 hp side loader that with the pedal to the metal I'd be lucky to
&gt;reach 4000 rpm winding it out going downhill.

I would say congratulations on having an exceptional motor, then! If you
were revving it that high and not noticing, the beast is smooooth and
capable. I noticed that you do have some mildish racey stuff in the case.
so you should be fine... especially with the highrev spring set up.
I once had an old 1600 that NEEDED to rev to 4k+ just to get it up to speed
- worn rings, worn cam, thrashed heads. I have no idea how long the PO
drove it like that, but boy did one NOTICE that the motor hated the 4-5Ks
it was being forced into.
