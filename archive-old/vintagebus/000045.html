&lt;&lt; What size battery were these things supposed to have?  &gt;&gt;
Hi Larry,
What size?  Dimensional?  Cold cranking?  Voltage?  Here is what VW stated in 
thier bus shop manual.  From AUG66, Chassi No. 217 000 001, 12 volt, capacity 
of 45 AH.  Previously the 12 volt battery used from about 1963 was 44 AH.
