what were you doing crawling around in the recycle bin? Maybe you and
&quot;vanbondo&quot; could get together (if his boss will let him leave his post on
the corner) and go dumpster diving for that rarest of the rare trinket some
old lady threw away cause it was taking up space

&gt;I'm not sure how this could happen???????????
&gt;I found a 25th Anniversary Edition Muir compleat idiots manual in a box
&gt;that was put into a recycle bin!!!!!!
&gt;What is this world coming to.  Or is it the result of some significant
&gt;others wrath????  Too much herb?????  A soul pushed over the edge crying
&gt;for help??  what?
&gt;Who does that on purpose, really?
&gt;I normally never do a Friday topic, but......
&gt;later
