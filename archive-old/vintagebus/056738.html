&gt; I've noticed several mentions of correct carburetor jetting and have to 
&gt; admit I'm pretty clueless about it.  I am wondering if perhaps this is the 
&gt; source of my persistent overheating (running at around 260+ in summer on 
&gt; long (2 hours or more) highway drives at speeds of 50-55mph).

Hi Diana,
Could be.  Could also be wrong type muffler, air cleaner, cooling fan, relief 
valve springs, lower pulley, clogged oil cooler, too high of RPM way over 
3,000 RPM at 55-60MPH, missing cooling tin, etc., etc.....

&gt; The carb I am using is a Bocar 30 pict-1, sold by Cal Imports as a Solex but
&gt; I guess it's an aftermarket equivalent???

Should be.

  Straight out of the box about 3 &gt; years ago.  I'm running a 1600 sp engine, 
&gt; 009 distributor.  Anyone have a guess as to whether I need to change the 
&gt; jet?

Not a clue without more data, such as which air cleaner, type of muffler, and 
most importantly what jetting you have now.

&gt;&gt;  And are we talking about the one behind the float bowl drain plug or??? &lt;&lt;


That one is the main jet just to the inside of the float bowl plug.  In 
earlier carburetors this is threaded into the float plug itself.  The air 
correction jet is the one you can easily see looking down the throat of the 
carburetor that is brass with a slot tip screw slot in the top.  The pilot 
(idle) jet is the one on the right side of the carburetor and also has a slot 
in it for a slot tip screw driver and usually has a hex head also.  All of 
the previously mentioned jets and a few more that are not easily 
replacable/changable in the carburetor have to work like a well tuned chorus. 
 One incorrectly sized jet throws the whole effect off just like a tone deaf 
singer would.
  Best to pick up a 1968 and later bus or bug &quot;Official Service Manual&quot; 
printed by Bentley which can be found for $30.00 or less at used book stores. 
 These have tons of good info and lots of good pictures for 1500-1600 
engines.
