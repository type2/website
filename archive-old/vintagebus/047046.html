 T Anyhow, I think it is a '58 model year bus.  I get so confused on &quot;model
 year&quot; vs &quot;production year&quot;.  The chassis number is 235,199.  My notes say
 this is produced in '57.   So...this makes it a '58, right?
-----
look it up in the Muir book- the model year began in aug any way.   but yours
I think is earlier( I am not looking it up right now)
...
As memory serves, the new pickup has the bigger of the small tail lights. 
 It does have a small, circular, metal frame to ...possibly a
 reflector?..below the regular tail lights.  I thought the light and
 reflector arangement was earlier than '58.  My '58 Panel just has lights.  
 BTW, what are my engine lid options here?  Are trucks one-year-onlys for
 '57 &amp; '58?  Will a later pre-'67 lid fit with a corresponding apron?
  - - - - -
either it is an early 57 with the brake light deck lid, the round bubble
taillights with the screws/bracket in the engine compartment and a square hole
below on each side fo rthe reflector, or it is a later 57 or a 58 with the
flat decklid (flat area above the liscence plate) and the round glass
taillights with the screws on the outside of it.

 I was looking at pictures of San Antonio's &quot;own&quot; Mike Gensler's '58 SC
 (&quot;Zorm&quot;) the other night. 
 http://lonestar.texas_dot_net/~gensler/zorm/zrm3-298.JPG  That SOB has
 semaphores!  How COOL is that?......I was floored.  How did that happen?  I
 knew the SC that I just got HAS to be older (older is cooler, ha, ha) than
 Mike's but I guess he has an unusual deal.  I was hoping they ran sema's
 later on trucks than buses.  
   &gt;&gt;
if mike's is a euro model, semaphores would be stock (on all types 2s through
about 1960).  The N Am export version came with blinking signal lights.

oh- any apron will fit through 67- sort of.   The elbow brace was used through
Dec 63, so a later one will have a spring which has no place to attach to on
your truck, the 66/67 ones take a different apron.    But yours came with the
brakelight decklid or the flat decklid.
