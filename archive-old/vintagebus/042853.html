&quot;They are HIGHLY desirable. I know.&quot;

Sorry to tell you, but I never said that.  I asked if a walk-through was
really that rare.  I don't want to get caught up in all this walk-through
bashing.  I just bought a bus and had a question....that's all.  Thanks
for your concern, though.  I'll try out the walk-through and tell you what
I think.
