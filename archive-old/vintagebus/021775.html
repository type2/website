&lt;&lt; Your absolutely right. I will get in there and take the rear shroud off 
get that thermostat rod hooked up and install my thermostat. Thats it? No 
calibrating or anything?&gt;&gt;
Hi Virge,
Once the engine is back in the bus you adjust the thermostat.  You want to 
remove the bolt in the bottom of the thermostat bellows out.  Then adjust the 
mounting bracket so the top of the thermostat is just below the ceiling of 
the mounting bracket. You can fine adjust it a bit more by threading the 
bellows on or off a bit on the rod, but be carefully not to loosen it too 
much!  Then just pull the bellows down, and into it's mounting bracket hole, 
and bolt it back in.

&lt;&lt;Also I have to ask your advice about my exhaust shroud for my doghouse oil 
cooler. Does the exhaust end go between the rubber seal and the firewall or 
does it point straightdown. Got under the bus and didnt see any way for the 
heat to exhaust out. Do I just shove that metal exhaust shroud stright down 
and out? Also noticed a small round hole with a rubber gromet around it that 
goes stright back behind the left manifold and comes out near the clutch 
adjustment cable. Does this hole have something to do with the oil cooler 
exhaust?  &gt;&gt;
  The exaust tube for the doghouse should be a four inch wide &quot;D&quot; shape out 
the front shroud.

&lt;&lt;by the way I have a 1600 DP from a 71.&gt;&gt;
While you have the intake manifold off polish the aluminuim pieces ends to 
help the rubber seals seal better, and check the bottoms of these for 
straightness to make sure they seal to the heads!  Then install new rubber 
seals to prevent leakage which will lean out one side of your motor, and burn 
a exaust valve or two.
  You really need to get a Bentley manual for a late model VW with doghouse.  
That way you can have plenty of pictures and info on your engine.  After all 
a picture is worth a thousand words!   Eric&amp;Barb
