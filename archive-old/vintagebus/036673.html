This gels with my experience. My '60 Dcab built on the 18 December '59 has
the tunnel box. While I would like to have had a 1950's bus I must say that
a split box sounds like a parts and repair nightmare just waiting to happen.
Befopre I get my ass flamed off please bear in mind that I drive my bus
daily and I live in Deepest Darkest Africa where practitioners of the gentle
art of split box repair are extremely thin on the ground.
