Subject: Head Stud advice

Anybody care to kindly advise me on where to go from
here? I recently purchased a Westy that had a fairly
fresh rebuild in it. The rebuilder used GEX heads
which so kindly blew out a spark plug, so I got some
new Brazillian heads to replace them. Today while
replacing the first one, a few of the head studs
backed out while taking off the nuts. I at first put
them back in all the way threaded in, but they proved
to be in too far to thread on the nut, so I backed
them out some. When I went to torque them down, one of
the studs began pulling out the case saver. I spent
the better part of the day trying to get to the
archives and just finally got the page to come up. I
didn't find anything specific to what I want to ask,
so here's a list of questions:

1. Since the case saver is pulling out, can it be
fixed, or is the case unuseable?

2. After reading a post from Ronnie in the archives,
should the threads on the head studs be treated with
silicone to prevent leaking? 

3. If no to question 2, should threadlocker be used on
them to prevent backing out? Should threadlocker be
used on the head bolts?

4. I noticed an oil leak below the cylinder, which has
orange silicone at the base. What's the procedure for
fixing this? 

5. How far should the head studs be out from the case?

6. Any advice at all on what I should do would be
appreciated.

Thanks in advance
