&gt; Nobody is going to hazard an opinion on those KYG gas shocks?

Hi Curt,
That camber sounds like SOP to us.  The only time the rear tires are going to 
ride totally flat is if you have a load in it and/or a full camper kit.  KYB 
GR-2s came on our 1960 walk thru panel camper when we got it, and we 
installed KYB gas adjust shocks on our 1963 SC.  We do little to no 
off-roading and feel the stiffer shocks prevent the leaning of the bus/truck 
when taking twists and turns on those mountain pass roads, especially with a 
load on the roof rack or SC bed.
