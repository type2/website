Oh my gawd, the purple primer theft mystery!!!
Wow! now you have to live with what looks like an
excellent project. Good for you. ;-)

It's a darned good thing that I was one of the very
few who were *totally* in favor of the Double Door
Barndoor Deluxe Panel project. I'm all in favor of
customizing and doing it your way. F those vintage
nerds anyways! There is way too much of the cookie
cutter same old same old.

Serious round of congratulations on the progress!
Sincerely hope that you get tons of publicity and
notoriety for the work.

Crow &gt;firmly&lt; placed on the diet. If any silly
internet squabble helped make this happen then I see
it as a good thing. I'm glad that I (in a backhanded
B.S. way) helped make it happen.
Excellent work!
