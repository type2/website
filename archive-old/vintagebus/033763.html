At the Classic I saw a Japanese fellow with his BG buy 3 buses in a row
towards the end of the day, same thing, a briefcase full of cash, the funny
thing was 2 of them were Bay Windows!!! A 7 passenger and a Westy, both
beautiful and high priced$$$$

Another weird thing I have seen is people at Pomona, both Japanese and
Europeans with digital cameras, lap tops and cell phones, snapping pictures
and e-mailing them on the spot while working deals on cars.

The guy that bought my '55 must have had $50k on him.  I'm sure he was
packing, too...
