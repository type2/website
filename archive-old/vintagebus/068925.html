Subject: dead battery/gen. light solved

Thanks to all for your suggestions. Turns out, having
the dome light switch closed (on) for two weeks
drained the battery to complete zero and kept it
there. Effectively &quot;disconnecting&quot; the generator and
regulator, etc. So after I charged the battery (while
in the bus) to full, once the engine started the
generator light stayed on. 
So, I searched the archives for the polarization
method, polarized the generator by running it as a
motor for 5 sec's. Now everything is great. No red
light.

So keep that in mind if you run your battery out like
that and get a red light after recharging it.

Thanks, list. I'll be thinking af you guys as I roll
down PCH tomorrow with the sunroof open to let in the
75 degree sun.
