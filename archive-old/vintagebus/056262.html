Subject: 63 15 window FS in Charlotte

Hello folks,
 Due to a large change of pland in my future i have decided to sell my 63 15
window.. It has a good bit of surface rust and rust in the usual areas. It
has the back seat , all the panels ,(in not so good shape), and the front
seat. no bumpers, no belt trim, no jail bars no motor ,.  Has all the glass
except the windshields.

It is a good project or donor, No Title but I can get a correct NC title for
$150

$400 takes it, located in Charlotte NC
