&gt; It sounds as if the balloons had something more than paint thinner in
&gt; them 
&gt; -- lacquer thinner would soften and ruin lacquer coatings -- which the
&gt; type 3 might have had, especially on patches or resprays.  I think VW

Well, being on the typ3 mailing list when this happened, I know the notch
in question.

The car had only been out of the bodyshop a few days, after a complete
restocustomization.  &quot;The Roadster&quot; is its best description.  No top, well
reinforced frame to compensate, and a immaculate paintjob. (ok...it was
pink...:)

The car is (AFAIK) still back in the bodyshop, undergoing a complete RE
restoration.  The damage may have consisted only of splotches and bad
spots, but, being a liquid, it seeped into the seams between bodypanels,
window moulding, etc.   The only way to correct THIs is to remove it all.
And restrip, and respray fromthe ground up.

I dont recall if his insurance covered this or not, but we're talking
THOUSANDS of dollars to redo this car.

Kids, if you ever think it's &quot;cool&quot; to vandalize someone elses property,
(in this case, their aircooled vintage VW) stop, and think it through.
The value of that object, to you, may not be much, but to the owner, it
could be tremendous.

think about it in this way:  Your skin, to any other human, is completely
and totally worthless.  Nothing they can do with it, other than perhaps as
a trophy.  

So, since it is worthless, someone decides you dont need it, and burns it
off of you.  Same thing, one is just a bit more extreme.

Bus content?  if someone had done this to my 66, with its mostly-opriginal
paint, surface rust, dings and dongs, etc, and I caught them, you can be
quite sure I would not stop at killing them.  by the way, some of the
pictures are finally back, I hope to get them scanned this weekend....I'll
let you know mroe!:)

later....david
