thousand  people come through our gates.We gave out over thirty trophies to
the top show cars. The gate fee is 2-3 can goods or 1 buck or more if you
would like to donate to a worthy cause, The Chattanooga Food Bank.
  Venders and Show cars cost $15.00 and all the can goods you can bring. We
will have a live local band, food and beverages this year. We donated over a
ton of food and $250.00 dollars in cash last year. We hope to go beyond those
