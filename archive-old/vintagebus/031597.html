Subject: Re: [VB] New Member, but I got here as fast as I could...

There's a lot to be said for shipping a ready-to-drive bus out from the
left coast versus restoring a local one yourself.  Gets most of the cost
out of the way up front, bank can finance it all, no lengthy restoration
to pay for out of pocket, no worry about when and whether you'll ever
get it done.  Plan to pay around $1000 for auto shipping coast to
coast.  Driving it home is cheaper but riskier unless you have
rock-solid assurances from the PO that maintenance is up-to-date for the
engine, tranny, RGBs, suspension, brakes, fuel system, and so on.

On the other hand, restoring a local bus gives you the satisfaction of
returning another classic VW to the road in better shape than you found
it.  Another good spot for online auto ads is www.traderonline_dot_com,
under the classic auto section.  Their large database is searchable by
region, make and model, and years.

Just my opinion, of course.

&gt; see what I can turn up locally first. Hmmm.... There is that 67 SC
&gt; for sale up in NH on thesamba_dot_com, but rust in the treasure chest
&gt; kinda scares me.
