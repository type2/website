My 61 corner window has been sitting patiently in the garage for about a 
year.    I drove back from Kellley Park show last April in it, and didn't 
like the rear end's incrreased whining and increasingly poor shifting, and 
removed the trans, and pulled the rgboxes apart.

the one side (left) was pretty thrashed, the upper outer bearing was toast, 
the circlip was bent and had fallenoff, the end of the axle shaft no longer 
had the ridge for the bearing.

in the meantime I have assembled parts.  RGBox bearings   new nuts for the 
inside of the stub axle, new plugs for the boxes (using big nut boxes)  
axles...

...  well the one axle was junk, the other okay, so letsee, here's three (3?) 
over in the corner of the garage.   hm, not so impressed, pits, grooves,  
okay, 2 more in the back shed.      hm,   picked up a couple more from Kyle,  
  have this stack on my worksbench, hm- pull aparts another small nut tranny 
axles that is suposed to be &quot;good used, the guy just wanted to lower it with 
straight axles and doesn't want it&quot;, that turned out to have some funky 
mushed stuff around a crown gear anmd a couple bad bearings.  I am also 
noticing my crown gears are funky, 

anyhow, I have 10 axles, which is best?   there are big pits on some.  at the 
paddle end you can tell if they have been turned or not, by the wear being on 
which edge of each side of the paddle.   They also can get a nice groove 
mushed in there on the power edge of the paddle, and a groove perpiendicular 
to the axle shaft where it wore against the fulcrum plate.  used a straight 
edge to see if I could see light through.

ended up taking the whoile pile of pick up sticks over to Eric&amp;Barbs, where 
Eric was unimpressed with the quality of these axles in general,  measured  
carefully and found a couple that were only about 4 or 5 thousands worn.   I 
always like a second opinion.  

crown gears, they get these vertical cracks in them, junk
the smilys extended with cracks, dont like that either.  they also get wear 
on the teeth (fancy that)   seems like half or more of them get cracks

pulled axles of a swing axle bug tranny someone gave me.   Had beautiful 
paddle ends to the axles, lovely fulcrum plates, and one crown gear was very 
nice.   The paddles you could see the machine marks there, just a little wear 
on the thrust side, no grooves or pits.   buses really thrash them bad, too 
bad bug axles are not interchangable (dont want to lower it)

so finally found 2 good crown gears- no cracks.  two decent axles, and a pile 
of fulcrum plates.  went through the FPs and tossed the ones with grooves or 
big pits or broken pieces into the garbage.    picked out about a dozen that 
were very nice and piled them with the stuff to go in the 61.

fun huh?   WHy do I bother, you might wonder,  why hassle to find pieces that 
are closer to perfection?    cause I want those axles to fit nice and snug, 
not sloppys , make nice smooth workings of turnings.  And I really started 
looking at these pieces and seeing how the wear patterns work,seeing what 
causes them, and that if it is sloppy it with wear worse.  I really like my 
corner window bus, and want these bits to be nice.  

so, this is the 61 with the $35 big nut swap meet tranny that would push it 
58 mph at 3K which was really 62mph, that turned out to be a 4.37 r&amp;p when I 
took it out and pulled the side cover and counted teeth on ring gear 
(35teethonringgear/8onpinionshat=4.375) and was surprised when I realised it 
was a 4.37, as I had not expected that because of the tach, the math led me 
to believe it would have a taller r&amp;p
 That is why I posted the tached results on it and for comparision on my 65.  
 

that is why I dont get the math.

  it really cruised 60ish at 3K in 4th with a 4.375 r&amp;p w/1.26 RGears.   
remember putting your tach on it, Eric?
