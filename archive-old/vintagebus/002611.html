Subject: Re: [VB] little red light

That there is the hazard indicator light. It is present on every 65 I have
ever seen, and some 64's. I haven't any idea if it went earlier than that,
but it sure doesn't belong on a 67. If'n you want it anyway, you  would want
to connect it to the red light in your hazard light knob.

&gt; There is a little red light between speedometer and fuel gauge on some
split
&gt; buses what is it for ? , my 67 single cab doesnt have it , I have one and
&gt; want to install that but where should I hook it up ? . I am improving the
&gt; dash I have installed an original clock and an old vdo tach , thats why I
&gt; want that little red light ..
