Subject: Re: [VB] Driving my Double Cab

I get that all the time. My standard answer is, &quot;They didn't have Fords or 
Chevys in Germany, they had to make their own trucks. The U.S. manufacturers 
caught onto the VW &quot;minivan&quot; but haven't copied the 3 tailgate idea... yet.&quot;




After driving my bright orangish-yellow DC daily for 5 years, I've decided to 
reduce my projects, clear out the driveway and concentrate on my '65 21 window. 
The '71 bug is gone, the '74 Thing will get a new engine and be sold off 
locally, '79 Westy will go to a deserving brewer soon and the DC will be put up 
on the block. I need to fix a few electrical gremlins and do something about the 
paint, so look for it at the October OCTO or Pomona a week later. '63 with a 
1970 T1 rear end welded in, 1835cc with baby Dells. Cut and turned ball joint 
front end with disc brakes and polished cookie cutters. 2&quot; lower than stock, 
chrome window frames front and back with chromed German safari's. Interior is 
sound abated and recent tasteful upholstery. Uncut dash, oil pressure &amp; temp 
guages, good stereo.

&gt; What gets me is so many people think it's a custom jobbie.
