Uncle Jerry said:

&gt; Just got back from a VW club meeting in Phoenix--Some one just bought a
&gt; new AM/FM, Cassette radio at Radio Shack for $50 for their bus!! He said
&gt; it fits right inside the hole for the stock VW radio NO Cutting
&gt; Needed!!! The knobs are closer together and that eliminates and surgery
&gt; on your dash.  He said it looks great!!! Will also fit a Bug!! Mind you
&gt; i have NOT seen this set up--Just thought i would pass it along--And
&gt; they are supposed to be on sale now for less than $50!! Happy
&gt; Hunting!!!  TWWM ,uncle jerry

At www.radioshack_dot_com they list:

SALE $39.99
Shaft-type AM/FM stereo cassette
Great for trucks and older cars with dash opening for
control shafts. Cassette auto stop. Backlit display.
#12-2004 Reg. 49.99. 20% OFF

It's on the last page of this PDF:
http://www.radioshack_dot_com/MonthlySpecials/PDFDownloads/December/Booklets/Spkrs_HomeCarAudio.pdf

Looks like one of those &quot;even has FF/EJ&quot; featureless models.

Wish I could find one of those old Audiovox AM/FM/8T models we used to
have in our old bus.  My 71 westy (on the road!!) still has the blockoff
plate (but speakers in the doors?!) so I'm not yet sure what I want to
do.
