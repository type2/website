I'm having a bit of trouble getting my 36hp generator pulley off, need some

suggestions.  It is _stuck_!



Here's what I tried:

1. Put a screwdriver in the slot, like normal, succeeded in bending the slot

and ripping the screw driver out of my hands a few times.  ;p

2. Put a socket on the back of the fan, that loosened the fan nut. ;)

3. Doused it with Liquid Wrench, tapped it, etc. to work it in.  Tried #1

and #2 again, same results.  ;(



Help,

'55 Kombi - &quot;Did the PO use an impact wrench to tighten this?&quot;

you mean the outer part of the gen pulley?  Or the inner half?  Or is the nut
stuck?
