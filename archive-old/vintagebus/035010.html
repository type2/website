 I need a few small items for the panel and the '55:
 
 for the '60: 5 dome light housings (I plan to buy repro lenses) - I need to
 replace the original ones, plus one for each door and the rear hatch.
 
 for the '55: ebrake cable &quot;claws&quot; that hold the ebrake cable to the backing
 plate.  I tried the RMMW repro ones, and the were unsatisfactory.
 
 Thanks!

Hi Thom, I have a pair of the &quot;claws&quot; the bits that bolt on the inward side 
of the backing plate to hold the ebrake cable
