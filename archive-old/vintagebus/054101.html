&lt;&lt; What would be your recommendation?? I see in one chart just by switching 
to a 3.88 R&amp;P, with everything unchanged will run 68 mph at 3500 rpm. True??&gt;&gt;

Hi Scott,
We are real happy with the 3.88R&amp;P and .82 fourth gear with our SP 1641 CW 
engine.  With 205s on all four rims we get 58MPH _at_ 3,000 RPM and still get 24 
MPG.  Have not tried it at 3,500 RPM with the tach to see where it RPMs at 
yet.

&lt;&lt;Which VW transmissions carried the 3.88? &gt;&gt;

The majority of post-1972 type 1s.   Eric&amp;Barb
