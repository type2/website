Subject: Re: Re: [VB] Hot showers at bus campouts ?

Paul/Craig,

Man o man, that is definately what you need over there.  You know what would be sweet, a big ass bus campout in Luckenbach.....kinda like when they do the chili cookoffs...but who knows what would be involved with that.  There are so many sweet places to do a campout in Texas.

Anyhow....porta pots a must, and lots of them.  Showers are not essential, but it makes it nice.  After many years of camping with my kids, a portable toilet in the bus is must have.  The most important factor in a campout is the location and campsites.

Honestly, IMO, Jerome sucks ass with the dust and dirt and lack of facilities.  If you want to see one kick ass location and IMO the best show of the year, truck that Singlecab out to Havasu in January.  Grass field to camp on, showers if you want, plus great weather.  Kudos to the Havasu fellas for constantly improving that show.

Murrieta, CA - Livingston, TX is home.

&gt; paul, it sounds like you are planning to organize a texas bus 
&gt; campout!  for a good mix of primitive/comfort camping, i'd suggest 
&gt; (at the risk of ruining my secret hideaway) caprock state park... up 
&gt; near the panhandle. similar to jerome, az in many ways; not too
