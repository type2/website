Subject: 2 good days with Rusty Bus!!

Richard and Dawn who were just married at Jerome in the back of a single
cab and Dawn's son Robert just spent 2 really nice days with my daughter
Rachel and I.  We had a really great time talking busses and bus trips.
Rachel is 2 and a half, but had hours of fun playing with Robert who is 4.
Rachel was very upset to see Robert leave.

Dawn has wanted a Deluxe sunroof bus for a while, so on the way back from
wedding in KC, they stopped by to see if I had one.  Dawn feel in love with
Pearl, the '66 Pearl White 21 window bus and decided to take it back home
with them.

So we pulled Pearl out of the barn and Richard starts to prep Pearl for the
trip while Dawn installs the hitch on Rusty Bus.  Dawn also has to change
the muffler, because the hitch won't fit with the quiet packs that are on
there.  Richard wired up the lights to Pearl and has to use Pearl's brake
light switch because the one on Rusty Bus won't work.  When the lights are
hooked up, Pearl has much brighter lights than the ones on Rusty Bus.

Now how are they going to get it home?  It has been sitting in my barn for
17 years and doesn't have an engine in it.  They decided to tow it home!
Richard has packed a tow bar and hitch just in case.  What will they tow it
with?  Rusty bus of course!!

Poor old Rusty bus makes most of my busses look brand new!!  I can't
believe how much metal ISN'T in that bus!!  And of course, this time of
year we have cold rains which happened on Wednesday night (we even lost
power from the lightning).  But Rusty Bus was safe under the carport and
covered with rolls of yellow duct tape.  Dawn did a very nice and colorful
job taping up all the holes on that bus.

So off they go, next stop Busses and Ballons, about a 14 hour trip without
any extra weight.  I can't believe they are towing one bus with another
over 1300 miles home.  Richard hadn't got the heaters hooked up, (who needs
them in Phoenix) and the low tonight is in the lower 30's.  The load
contains two busses (the engine I found for Pearl is just a core), 3
people, all the camping equipment, full length roof rack with bumpers and
spare tires and a cast iron tub that Dawn picked up at a local garage
sale!!  All this on a tired 1600 engine with no spare engine to back it up.

We wish them well in there journey, we will miss them, they are good people.
