the '73 sb trans is an irs, you will need to change
the differential and the side covers, flip the ring
gear over to the 'bus' side, then reset the backlash
on the ring and pinion. it might be a relatively cost
effective solution. '72 was the last year for dual
side covers, and the first year for the larger throw
out bearing cross shaft, which makes them highly
desirable for the big horsepower sand rails. at least
that is the rule of thumb out this way. good luck,
