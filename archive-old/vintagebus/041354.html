Subject: 31 PICT help
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.A41.4.10.10003061033340.140646-100000_at_homer35.u.washington_dot_edu&gt;

List-

I rebuilt my 31 PICT carb this weekend with a universal solex kit
(gaskets, needle valve, choke pull-off and accelerator pump diaphragms)
and am having a hard time getting it tuned right.  I adjusted it using the
directions for a 34 PICT (volume control out 2.5 turns, warm up, set idle
w/ bypass screw, adjust volume control, reset idle) and it
runs fine at idle, but backfires through the carb and has no power at
higher speeds.  I was really careful during the cleaning and reassembly,
have new plugs and the timing is correct.  Any thoughts before I bite the
bullet and take this thing in to a professional?

TIA-
Tristan
