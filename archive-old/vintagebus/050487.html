Subject: New listee announcement!

Well since its Friday and a few people have asked...

  Lisa and I had a little girl on September 8, 6lbs,6oz 
19&quot; long (which is why we missed Jerome)! I brought Lisa 
and Emma home in the New beetle, but look forward to our 
first family outing in the DC! It might be to the 
Central California Volks Folks meeting on Monday the 8th.
  Also, I turn 30 on the 5th and it looks like I will be 
getting a garage for my birthday! Woo hoo!! As a bonus 
the garage will probably come with a house.
 
 ....so how long do I have to wait to teach Emma how to 
adjust the valves on the Double Cab??
