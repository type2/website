not to play devil's advocate, and those of you who know me know i'm against
carcking down, but hey, they are in business and it IS THEIR logo.  think
of it as plaigarism to an author,like napster to metallica. wouldn't you be
upset if someone used your name/logo to make money hand over fist? 
granted, website url's is stretching a bit far, but it's now a cut-throat
money-grubbing world, and they need to protect all aspects of their
trademark.  maybe a thing to do would be to write a LETTER on PAPER
(remember how?) to vw explaining your viewpoint to them, rather than just
internalizing it on a discussion list, and see what the have to say.

&gt; &gt; VW has been on the web rampage again, been after all web sites using the
&gt; &gt;  letters VW in there url. In my opinion I would and will personally
BOYCOTT
&gt; &gt;  any VW show backed or at VW o A 
&gt; &gt;  ronnie

&gt; I agree. VW would have to do some major tire licking before I would show
up. 
&gt; Why should we help out VWoA with a show when they wont even allow us to
have 
&gt; their damn letters?
