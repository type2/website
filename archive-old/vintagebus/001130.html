&gt;I have a 66 Crew cab and was wondering if there is any way to install roll
&gt;down windows versus the stock slide back windows.  I like hanging my arm
&gt;out the window, but with the sliding setup, it is fairly uncomfortable to
&gt;do this.


Probably no practical way to install roll-ups. Maybe remove the entire
window assembly during warm weather. Have some lexan side curtains made to
fill the opening during unseasonable rain or chilly mountain evenings. JOMO
