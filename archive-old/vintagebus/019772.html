&gt;ya, I think just towards the driver form the ashtray.   I didn't feel like 
&gt;drilling the dash in my 65, so I have the socket in the radio block off.  I 
&gt;had found one that had been predrilled.  I put the lighted socket in, which 
&gt;isn't stock, but easier to find in the dark.  Its not a ten point restoration 
&gt;bus.

Mine neither. :-)  Not a bad idea.  I figured a way to hang one off the underside of the shelf so it's workable (as an accessory socket) but unobtrusive - most likely will go that 
way.  Radio Shack sells mountable lighter sockets, but they don't look bus-kosher.

BTW for those who are looking at tunes options in their splits: until I get a working stereo that will fit the dash, I'm using a portable CD player plugged into a Radio Shack 40W 
eq/amp (~$60) that seems to put out plenty of sound.  Even has a CD jack on the front.  Speakers in the doors right under the vent wings (no panels yet) and under the back 
seat.  Pix soon.  I had been looking for a way to keep the amp and speakers in the car but be able to carry the source from vehicle to vehicle and this looks like the ticket for 
now.  What I *really* want is an all-RAM MP3/CDA player with a radio, designed to look like a Sapphire II.  Not holding my breath.

&gt;hm- probably thoms webpage has a pic in there somewhere.

I searched for cigarette, lighter, and ashtray &amp; didn't see one.  But thanks for the idea!
