Subject: Complete OG  paint 63-15 window found in a Pick &amp; Pull

.....  We offered to buy the whole thing from the place, but they didn't
want to sell whole as there is no title.  We said &quot;no Problem&quot; to title
issue &amp; hope to still save it. Stay tuned.
.........

Update: The Pick &amp; Pull will not sell this bus whole. Has anyone else dealt
w/ this issue.  It is to nice to strip &amp; crush or cut up.

Tom Buese-15 window waiting to be saved
