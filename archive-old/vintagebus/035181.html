Subject:  Cheap Taiwan/China parts screw me!!!


&gt; Just passing along a helpful tip...  Never buy the cheapo chrome generator
&gt; pulleys made by Empi/Bugpack!!!  
&gt; 
&gt; Last night while driving home from the local bus club drive-in movie night
&gt; the generator light came on...  So I pulled over immediately to check that
&gt; the fan belt was still on.  Yep, looked good and thought maybe the battery
&gt; or generator might be toast, no big deal can make it home on battery
&gt; power.  Closed the lid and carried on...  Watched the oil temperature
&gt; climb from 180 to 220 in about a mile!  Oh snap!  Time to pull it over at
&gt; a well lit gas station (Chevron in this case).  Open up the lid one more
&gt; time and hand turn the pulley shaft, but yet the belt pulley housing will
&gt; not turn.  This is odd.  I thought I must have sheared the woodruff key,
&gt; big problem since I do not carry a spare (never heard of one breaking
&gt; before).  Take off the pulley/shims and find that the pulley woodruff key
&gt; grove was totally reamed out!  Insert profanity here towards
&gt; Taiwan/China/EMPI/Bugpack :)  
&gt; 
&gt; Luckily I called a buddy at midnight and he yanked his assembly off of his
&gt; '71 to donate for the journey home.  
&gt; 
&gt; Needless to say I was very disappointed in the quality of the metal in the
&gt; chrome generator pulley parts.  I am now in the process of getting a real
&gt; VW part.  Of course the local VW FLAPS was pushing the chrome job again
&gt; and I was like no way dude.
&gt; 
&gt; Live and learn,
