Subject: Re: [VB] cleaning engine compartment


I have used both oven cleaner and engine degreaser with no problems,They 
make some easy off stuff that is supposedly fume free that I had no prob 
with on my bus.I as a general rule use the castrol degreaser ,(mainly 
because I have heard other horror stories of the oven cleaner eating 
everything).It has worked pretty well,the best stuff going is probably from 
Griots(sp?)I borrowed some from a friend and it was AMAZING!Eastwood 
probably has some really good stuff also.
Good luck.......

&gt;
&gt;For the Love of God, do not use oven cleaner.  I
&gt;accidently used some in my compartment, and what used
&gt;to be beautiful factory paint is now bare metal.  I've
&gt;also noticed that some engine degreasers/cleaners warn
&gt;you not to get on paint, as it may stain/ruin.  Either
&gt;way, hot water + dish detergent seems to work well, no
&gt;paint lost, but the grease is gone.  but if you're
&gt;looking to get paint off, Easy Off oven cleaner works
&gt;wonders.
