My ex-wife's sister's boyfriend's parole officer knew someone whose next door 
neighbor's brother had almost the *exact* same thing happen to him,
'cept it was on an old dodge with a mason jar and a tube sock for a gas filter...

&gt; ok kids, TIME FOR A POLL. how many of you have personally had a &quot;little
&gt; plastic fuel filter&quot; come apart and douse your engine.  PLEASE P-MAIL ME.
&gt; I'LL GIVE IT A WEEK AND REPORT MY FINDINGS.  i sold 1000's of these of all
&gt; kinds of manufacture, and have used 100's personally, and never had one
&gt; come apart, nor someone complain about it.  the only person who said this
&gt; happened to him was ed, neato pres (why didn't you vote), but he has his
&gt; own consipracy theory on that one.
