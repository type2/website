I just wanted to relate a quick little story to you all.  As you are well
aware, I've been patiently awaiting my back ordered torsion arm grease seals
from Ronnie at the Old Volks home.  Now it's no secret that I do repeat
business with Ronnie - he's really a hard working guy with some serious bus
karma.  Earlier I mentioned that my grease seals I had ordered hadn't
arrived and I was a bit miffed at the whole situation but I realize that
with bus parts or VW parts, you're going to have back orders and delays that
can't be helped.  I try to help myself by ordering in advance but sometimes
that isn't even enough.

Ronnie went ahead and told me the seals were shipped Friday along with some
other parts that I needed so I figured it would be another 1 week delay in
getting the parts.  I've frittered away my weekend but I made $50 by tuning
up a roto-tiller that I found in my neighbor's trash and selling it.  Then I
repaired the CDRom drive in this P166 I use.  (The door was stuck and when
it came out, it ejected itself onto the table!)  I then started taking my
homemade mp3 player parts to the shop to work on them and that is when I
found a box from Ronnie buried under a chair.

I opened it and there was my grease seals and shifter parts I ordered.  That
box was laying there since last Wednesday - the very day that I needed the
parts.  I could have had the front end done by now easily.  The whole story
as to how those seals got down there has been figured out and culprit argued
with (and it wasn't me - just a member of the family who is sitting in the
corner with her dunce cap on.)

So hats off to Ronnie for once again, pulling through with his end of the
deal and biting his lip when dealing with me.  Sometimes I seriously wonder
why people put up with me.  I can't even stand myself.
