&gt;Any suggestions on what type of tool and procedure you folks have found
&gt;successful in removing the pin that secures the e-brake handle?  I cant
&gt;seem to figure a way to get a hammer and punch up in there.  Bentley
&gt;just says remove the clips and pin and pull the handle out.  Oh, if it
&gt;were only that easy!
