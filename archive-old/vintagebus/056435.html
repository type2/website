Subject: Re: [VB] Sliding window scrapers...

I'm having the same problem with the driver's side of my bus, which I
replaced all the rubber in a couple of months ago.

The metal channel that holds the rubber against the window keeps sliding
towards the front of the bus every time I close the window.  The passanger
side might do this as well, but I don't open the passenger window as much,
since I also installed Safari windows when I went through my bus.  It's
really annoying to have to slide the metal piece back onto the rubber every
time I close the window.  Like the previous post, I couldn't discover what
held the top of the metal channel into the top of the door, through the felt
window channels.  Any suggestions?

Thanks,
Ed

Subject: [VB] Sliding window scrapers...


&gt; Preface: Searched the archive w/o success.
&gt;
&gt; Question: I (w/John Howard's serious help) recently rebuilt the windows
&gt; on my bus and am starting to have a problem with the vertical scrapers
&gt; poping out of the windows. Is there some sort of retention mechanism
&gt; that holds them in? The bottom is trapped between the glass and the
&gt; slider track thing, but the top has ??
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance for any help. Let me know if I'm not be detailed
&gt; enough.
