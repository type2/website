Subject: Just how fast does your bus go??

I was going to save this question for Friday, but all these discussions
concerning experiments and Trannys have me wondering about my bus.  Just how
fast does your bus go??

Everybody is talking about cruising down the road at 65 and 70 MPH; my bus
only goes 55-57 MPH (NOT 58+, unless there is a good tailwind and/or I am
going downhill).  I thought I was doing good, but I feel a bad case of
'speed envy' coming on &lt;vbg&gt;.

My '67 std is stock everything with a 1600SP engine.  I am running P225R-15
tires.  Seriously, I was courious if it is because everybody has DP engines
and higher performance trannys, or is it something I need to go out and
check on (performance-wise).  BTW it appears to be running fine.

BTW I got my seals replaced on all the fixed windows over the holidays.  I
have a whole new respect for those guys that do it for a living (and the
back window was a REAL bugger).  Thanks for all the tips.
