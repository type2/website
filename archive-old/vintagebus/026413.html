&gt; ================================
&gt; Here it is:
&gt; 1954 Volkswagen Rabbit Pickup $9500
&gt; Barndoor single cab bus. Mostly restored, been in storage. RARE!RARE! color: grey
&gt; 503-559-8168
&gt; ================================

Damn! I didnt know that they made barndoor rabbits. I wonder if I can
get in in diesel with semaphores?

It is even in my neck of the woods... I should call...actually, I bet it
is the one I posted on Ev's page some time ago, it sold to someone in
the 503 area code.
That was a nice singlecab! I shoulda bought it for $3k when I could
have.
