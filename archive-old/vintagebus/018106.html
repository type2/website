&lt;&lt;! And this is the last thing the bus community
needs, when buses get popular, the fun goes away. Why
does he want a bus now, cause 
Sienfeld has one?
  Mike&gt;&gt;

Where have you been? The Volkswagen Transporter is the
most popular vehicle around.... According to Car and
Driver, the bus is one of the top 10 most collectible
vehicles right now.  How will Eddie Van Halen make the
fun go away??  And what bus community are you in? I'd
like to stay far away from your unintelligent, hate
filled community!
