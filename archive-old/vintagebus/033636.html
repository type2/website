The OE Parts Book shows the padded visor being introduced at VIN 374 811
Aug. 
58 (1959 model year) in Ice Blue, Silver Beige (Grey to regular folks) or
Cloud 
White.  It's interesting to note that my ex-59 Euro Single Cab (back in the 
late 80's) had the cardboard visor however.  Could have depended on what
market 
the Bus/Pickup was sold.


*********************
&gt;    Who can tell me what year they ended using the chrome framed cardboard
&gt; visors in Deluxe buses. My new 1960 has padded, but all my other 1960's
era
&gt; buses have cardboard.
