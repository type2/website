Subject: resurrection

My bus is finally coming back to life. I am driving very, very little 
until I get the exhaust fixed. But, I am having to jocky it all over the 
place until next week when I get the historic plates for it. Don't want 
to bring the County back down on me and my &quot;eyesore&quot;. After I put the 
tags on it, I can legally park it right back where it was, but it won't 
be an &quot;eyesore&quot; in the eyes of the law because they will hsve gotten 
their $35.00!! Go figure.

Yesterday, I painted one side. Gone are the Forrest Gump colors. But 
before you all condemn me, they had to go. The paint was water based 
poster paint, was badly faded, looked like hell (especially with the rust 
in the rockers), and besides, I just couldn't see myself driving it 
lookin like that. And I do intend on driving it. Besides, Forrest Gump 
was a good movie, but it was no &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; or &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot;. 
Five more years and it will be faded from memory.

She's lookin pretty clean now. One more side to go and then I will dive 
into the rocker repairs (muffler first).
