&gt; Also anyone know what the big round red lens above the windshield wiper pull
&gt; switch is for.  I looked in my 65 owner's manual and it is not in the picture,
&gt; but it is definitely on my dash and on some (but not all) splits I have seen.
&gt; TIA

That is the emergency flasher indicator light.  Not sure what years it was on.
Up to 64-66 I think.  I know my 67 has the light integrated into the switch knob
itself.
