&gt; A good topic for me to discuss given the problems this particular issue ran 
&gt; up for me.  I had a bad gas tank and was pumping alot of filth through 
&gt; (pump/carb)  Since then I have had the tandem filter i.e. one between the 
&gt; gas tank and pump, and one between the pump and carb.  Guys come on now they 
&gt; are extremely cheap and double the protection.  Can't go wrong.

Well, every added part is another part that can fail.

My experience with the little plastic filters is that they stop small
fish, but nothing much smaller.  There are filters out there withthe same
line sizes, made for Japanese cars, that have much bigger filtering
elements.  They probably work a lot better as well!
