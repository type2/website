Subject: loaf to splitty fron beam

Hi all from Germany, On my 65 deluxe I have a late model front beam
which has the
the disc brakes. The previous owner guessed that was the way to go
especially when
he needed to slow down on the  autobahn. The question is this yes the
front end is
higher then normal, is there any way to drop it down from that 3
inches?  Is there
anyway to find out what year front beam I have so I can get the correct
replacement
disc brake parts? Is there a way to tell what year my brake calipers and
rotors
are?  Also I have the late style bolt pattern which I am not to happy
with. I want
to go with the early style 5 lug pattern that the bus came with in 65.
They just
look better, is there a quick fix to going with a early 5 lug
pattern?.............lets say wheel adapters? What are the disadvantages
if any with
wheel adapter or something else. Just a note I don't want to change out
the front
beam. I don't have the original, got to work with what I got.

One last note: I want to thank everyone on this list for the excellent
discussions
on many different topics about busses. I am new to the bus thing and
have learned
alot. I don't do alot of posting questions mostly just read the
interesting emails.
Thanks again
Bryan
