&gt; The repro clips suck.  You gotta bend 'em a little to help keep the
&gt; cap clipped.   The repro hubcaps don't help, either, as the lip isn't
quite
&gt; the same shape as the original.  I was going thru one or two hubcaps a
week
&gt; until I got it straigtened out.

Hart:
I went and found some old wheels with the clips intact. I drilled the
factory rivets out of the old clips, from the back freeing them from the
original wheels. Then I cleaned them up with a wire wheel and pop riveted
them on to my 14&quot; bus wheels, It cost me nothing but my time and I haven't
lost a hubcap since.
