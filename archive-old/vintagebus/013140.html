&gt;I put up pix of a regular and barndoor steering column
&gt; lock on my rare buses page

Thom,
I was wondering how you tell the difference between a
Barndoor steering column lock and an early Bug steering
column lock?  I've seen a few locks that I though were Bug,
they were early and had the thumb screw wiring cover.  The
sellers did not know what they fit.  Is there a part #
stamped on it?

Thank,
Everett
