I have my baywindow westy on there and it ain't doing too good. I added good
pics too late (last night) so maybe that was my problem. I was hoping to hit
double my reserve at least but have not even come close to it yet. (reserve
is $500, bidding is at $100!!!) So if anyone is looking for a great deal on
a later westy, please check it out! Or if anyone here is also on the type2
list, please pass this along. Happy Holidays all!!!
