Hi all
This past weekend I picked my Wife and Girls up at the airport, Returning
from 2 weeks stay in Florida.
I thought I'd get them excited a little, I had been talking of Buying a new
car,, and also thinking NEW BEETLE.. so i borrowed one for the weekend!
98 blue, new Beetle,, 50,000kms real clean,, nice car.
Well, it was nice to drive,, the 100 kms to the airport,,
I really needed to score some points, so I grabbed Red roses for the Wife
and 1 nice pink rose each for the girls!
I waited at the end of the Escalator, till they saw me.. GREAT BIG WAVES,,,
hugs and roses!  WOW!
We had a short conversation about the flight and a couple of new things,,
and they calmed down real quick,, and stated,, lets get home.. time to rest
.. the vacations over,, sigh!
So I grabbed the luggage,, and pointed them to the parking garage,,  as we
are walking thru the cars,, they are looking to spot one of the family
cars,,
So I pushed the horn sounding light blinkin' button on the remote key
thingy, and WOW did they ever SCREAM and jump!  Eyes light up like a million
Bucks!
After the million questions,,, who's is this? Did you buy it!?  I heard the
familiar SHOTGUN!!  LOL.. so it seemed we knew who was riding there...
:-) I asked &quot;Hon, You wanna drive?&quot;  and SHE GRABBED the keys!   It is great
to make people feel so Happy!
The 100 kms drive home took about 150kms as we had to stop at all the
friends They could think of!

So all that said,, we actually tired of the NEW BUG pretty quick..  it is a
nice car,,,,,
Some observations..
The back seat is not made for MY 6 ft frame!
No one drove up beside us and waved,, or gave the thumbs up... like they
always do in a V W  BUS!
No one passed the other way and gave a friendly wave.. unlike in the V W
BUS, it is usually an exagerated excited WAVE!
And there was no funny noises,, strange smells,, or breakdowns to be able to
meet anyone!

So... I am not going to buy a NEW BUG,,, they are a nice car,,, but just
that, a car.
I LOVE OUR BUS!!!!

I love some of YOUR buses!  :-)
