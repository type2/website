&gt; . . . I heard that cylinder head temp gauges &quot;aren't all that accurate&quot;

the temp of at the time of the installation shouldn't make any
difference with the reading since the vdo gauges are not able to be
calibrated. However when I was running one on my 66 I did notice that
cold days It would run &quot;hotter&quot;. checking the temp by hand (i.e.
dipstick test) wouldn't back up this reading. I've decided that the
increased temp difference is what caused the hotter engine. For
example there is more difference between 10 and 375 verses 100 and 375
