Just got back from the tire store, Firestone makes a tire called a LTP
205/75/15. This is still a 4 ply tire but Firestone calls it an SUV tire
because it has reinforced sideways to prevent sway. They forgot to bring one
in and will have one there for me to check out on Tuesday.
I will take my original Continental 15 inch spare over to compare overall
height and width to the Firestone, in 2 years of searching for a reinforced
sidewall tire to work on a transporter I think I may have found it.

ps. Bridgestone does make a 185/15 6 ply, cost is 138.95 a tire, but no
Bridgestone dealer I have talked to wants to bring any in, if they ever do,
we.ll all have it made. According to there specs they are 26.5 inchs tall
