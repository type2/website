Fred is Right.

I found these at http://www.boatersworld_dot_com 

I think they are $7.99 a pack now.

&gt; What you need are RECMAR Slide-Rite Curtain Track
&gt; slides.  These slides fit perfectly in every
Westfalia curtain track I've tried, splitties and
baywindows.
 
&gt; The kit in front of me is #3171.  It has 2 white 36&quot;
&gt; pieces of track, a couple of dozen white slides, and
the necessary stainless steel hardware to complete the
installation.  The price at Boater's World a couple of
years ago was $6.99.
&gt; 
&gt; When I went through this same inquiry/exchange last
&gt; September I found the
&gt; RECMAR curtain hardware in the online catalogs of
&gt; Boater's World, West
&gt; Marine, and Camping World.  Try searching for
&gt; &quot;RECMAR&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; FWIW.....
