Subject: Re: [VB] stoopid peeple!!!

the truck was gone and there was a *huge* dent in the
&gt;front of my bus!!!

On my local campus, I ALWAYS remember the license plate # of the clown in
front of me (sometimes behind and to the sides); that way I can file a
hit-and run/leaving the scene of an accident  report on em... will make
their day interesting, if nothing else.
