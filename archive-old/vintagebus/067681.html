Subject: re:Thermostat

was asked:&quot;how important is the thermostat?&quot;

well, it depends, but I would definitely install one if it is not there.

If you have the thermostat in place, it keeps the flaps on the cool fan
contraption shut while the engine warms up. This allows for your engine to
warm up faster, and essential parts to get lubricated quicker. Then when it
gets too warm. the flaps open, allowing the engine to cool the engine
better.

So if you live in a very hot climate, that never gets cool, and your engine
oil is alwasy very fluid....chances are your local vw folks have removed
their thermostats. (At least that is what almost every Houston VW owner I
met tried to convince me to do). As I am now in New England, I need the
thermostat, otherwise my engine would probably take forever to warm up.

so it is just a matter of how important it is to you to keep your engine oil
sloshing around and lubricating everything properly and quickly.
