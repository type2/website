Subject: Bessie and her Puck--

We now have very clean 1969 Puck--While playing around with our Sundial
Camper Tent, that fits on Bessie--as she is a Sundial Camper--Lady
Magoo=={Boy am I lucky to have her} came up with an idea to mount the
Sundial Tent to the Puck in just minutes and no holes to drill!! Also
through a friend in Germany, I found another German that deals in Puck
parts--I have to translate the list into Americaneze--but it appears he has
a number Puck goodies,  Including the red plastic trim that goes around the
Puck--Both sizes--Stay tuned-- TWWM, uj
