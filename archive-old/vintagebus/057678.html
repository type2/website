&gt; Hi All,
&gt;
&gt; I was picking through a pile of heads the other day and noticed that some of
&gt; the single port heads have intake manifold studs that are ~1cm closer
&gt; together than others...  what is what?   It seems that all the vintage speed
&gt; manifolds that I have are for the heads with the closer spaced studs.
