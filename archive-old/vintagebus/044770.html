&lt;&lt; my 65 Double cab. It has the stock big nut tranny and I was wondering what 
type bearing would fit? I have a clutch set for a 72 beetle and I know the 
disk and plate would work but the TOB does not have the round &quot;ears&quot; that fit 
into the arm on the
 tranny. It is the later style with the wire clips. Is there a way to use 
this later style TOB with my swing axle? &gt;&gt;
Hi TJ,
You can only go one of two ways.  Either replace your pressure plate with an 
early type with the release ring on it's three arms which the earlier TO 
bearing rides against, or replace your early TO bearing shaft with the later 
style so you can use the later pressure plate.
  We have had only bad luck with anything, but the 200mm nine spring pressure 
plate which can be converted for use with the later TO bearing by removing 
the release disc from it's three arms.  So just the three arms ride against 
the late model TO bearing.   Eric&amp;Barb
