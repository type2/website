&gt; If you take close notice you'll see that the VW logo is missing from the front of the Bus,
&gt; and no where did &quot;VW&quot; or &quot;Volkswagen&quot; get shown in the ad .........

This is fairly standard in the advertising biz.  They don't want you to be
distracted by other logos while you are being programmed to spend! spend!
SPEND! with your MASTERCARD!!!

It's just a bit more obvious in this ad, since the VW emblem is so large.
It's no slight against VW, just marketing wisdom.

I always got a kick out of the pickup ads where they were shown with dirt
bikes loaded in the bed.  They always had a stripe on the gas tank where
the name of the bike manufacturer normally appears.  One strip of gaffer's
tape and the marketing people are happy.  Wouldn't do to show a Honda
loaded into a Ford, would it?
