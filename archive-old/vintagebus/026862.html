Andy asked for the stone tablet, I gave it to him. I guess
he can't take the truth.

If Andy has a T2 that will pull 5000 rpms in 4th gear I'd
love to see it.

What do you say Andy, can you do it???????

&gt; &gt; I really don't care if you believe it or not, but it is
&gt; &gt; true. You can not drive a stock vw in 4th gear beyond the
&gt; &gt; safe rpm limit.

&gt; I can do lots of things. Enough already.
