If I was a really creative and daring writer I would have set the hook to the
story, making it go full circle, by writing:

&quot;Advertise Puck on VWPlanet. Dream about owning a ratty single cab and a
girlfriend who might be a 'sport'.&quot;

Didn't do that because I would then have to write the next chapter of how I am
looking for an apartment or a bus (or Puck) to live in. Let's not go there
folks!

Family first, Westy's second, trailers third.
