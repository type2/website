&gt;&lt;&lt; So why would it be pictured in a '55 owner's manual? &gt;&gt;
&gt;Why because they made the owners manuals before making that model year
VW and on occassion just left in previous pictures from years before that
still showed to the normal layman what they were writing about.  Eric&amp;Barb
&gt;
Ah yes, but according to your parts book dates and following your theory,
the '55 non-Barndoor owner's manual that Clara spoke of would have a picture
of a Barndoor-sized engine compartment...
