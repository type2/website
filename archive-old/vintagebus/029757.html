I removed the dash on the '54 a couple nights ago as part of the
dismembering process, and noticed a few things, and have some questions:
Anyone know how to remove the colored bubbles for the idiot lights?
&gt;
There are little rings in there that hold them in place, they can removed
from the back where the light sockets plug in.  I used a small dental pick
to pull each one out, it was a pain.  I haven't tried reassembly yet.

&gt;Anyone know how to remove the switches from the speedo plate?
&gt;
I think they are pressed outward on the back so drill? I haven't done it
myself although I know some people install screws in there so they can remove
the switches again if need be.  Watch out for the electrical piece(s) that
are inside there so they don't go flying off.

&gt;My bus was built 12/54; the clock is dated 10/54 and the speedo 7/54.
&gt;
I'm sure they had a big stack of crap to pick from.  I have a '55 BD speedo
out of a '54, it reads 94K and came out of a supposed 94K OG Bus, uh-oh...
