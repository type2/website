Subject: [VB] Brake MC clarification?


&gt; The links below are to pages of cip1_dot_com are for the dual-circuit MC and
the
&gt; adaptor to use it in a '67 or earlier bus.
&gt;
&gt; I've purchased the MC but, not the adaptor as the price ($59.95) is more
than
&gt; the MC ($39.95). I intended to use the procedure by described under
&quot;brakes&quot;
&gt; in the type2 library. Now, however I've changed my mind and decided the
&gt; adaptor may be the easiest route.
&gt;
&gt; My question is: does anyone know of any other adaptors out there that are
&gt; cheaper than this? The kit consists only of a machined ring to set the MC
back
&gt; from its mount, a boot, two bolts, and two nuts. Seems pretty pricey for
said
&gt; items. Although, I don't have cnc machines to do the fancy machining.

There is an additional problem with the adapter.
Due to manufacturing tolerances, it will fit one
brand of MC and not another.
I haven't made the conversion, and can't remember
the details. Anyone ?
