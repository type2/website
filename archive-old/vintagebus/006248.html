As to whether ambulance fans are practical, here's my idea:

Since my bus is destined to be a camper (I'll be making all the cabinetry, I
have a stock Z-bed, and all I need from someone is a icebox/range and
perhaps an interior heater (gas or propane/12-volt) ....let me start this
sentence over...

Since my bus is destined to be a camper, and Michele and I tend to travel
northwards, in either Spring or Autumn, there will be quite a bit of
cooking, coffee making, etc. inside the bus with the windows only partially
open.  So, have you ever boiled water in a VW?  You get condensation
everywhere!  My idea is to get ambulance fans or build the equivalent, and
put in a fan reverse switch (the hardest part is running the wiring) that
allows me to have the fans pump the steam-laden air to the outside through
the existing vent system!  Of course, the entire inner part of the duct is
going to be veritably rust-proof, and the reverse switch will naturally be
mounted on my own paneling in order that no 33-year-old panels need to be
cut.

What thinkest thou?

Gene
