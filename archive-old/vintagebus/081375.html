Subject: Re: Toolkit for bus pickup trip...

Hi Greg and all,

Hot VW's magazine a while back asked me to take a turn writing their
&quot;Transporter Talk&quot; column.  As it so happens, I just finished writing a 3 part
column on what I carry on long road trips in an old bus.  I included two long
lists, one of spare breakdown parts and the orther of all of the tool/supplies
I carry.  Theses lists of items/tools are more than the avarage Bus nut would
bother to carry, but for the purposes of the article I wanted to list as much
helpful stuff as possible.  I think the first two parts of the series are in
the Oct and Nov of 2004 issues.  The 3rd part is about to come out and should
be the list of tools.

Assuming that your dad is handy with tools and is familiar with VW's, send him
packing with as much of the tools and parts appropriate to this bus as
possible.  You never really know what some previous owner has &quot;really&quot; done or
not done to the new bus...  You'd hate to hear of a breakdown in the middle of
nowhere that they weren't prepared to deal with just because they wanted to
travel out there light.  Send along a Bentley manual, Idiot guide, and AIRS
list and a cell phone and AAA towing service card.  Those of us along the way
(I'm near St. Louis, MO) will be happy to assist if they need anything.  When
are they leaving?

I wish them a fun and uneventful (in terms of the bus) adventure!

Bill Bowman
