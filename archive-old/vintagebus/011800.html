I'm considering the purchase of a 58 hardtop deluxe located in Bremerton
Washington and was wondering if anyone in the area would be willing to take
a look at the bus for me. I'd be more than happy to compensate anyone for
their time/trouble. This doesn't have to be a thorough inspection but a
quick once over would suffice.
TIA,
Gary
