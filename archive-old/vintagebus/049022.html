Help!!!!!!

I tried but no luck.  Got out the shop manual, which sez to &quot;screw off switch retaining ring&quot;.  There are two small holes in the side of the retaining ring or bezel.  I made a little *tool* out of a coat hanger in the shape of a &quot;U&quot; and bent the ends in slightly.  I thought this would help me turn a 40 year old retaining ring.  I didn't want to force it, I've learned something in my years of tinkering with VW's.

What am I doing wrong?  Anyone with any experience on removing the fan swith on a ambu fan?

TIA.

Robert
