I delivered my last two boys at home. The last one took 18 house of labor, so
I kept sneaking out to the garage to add more to the engine I was building at
the time. I had to hit the Goop and run back in every time the bellow
sounded.

With a new 64 Pontiac that had dealer plates still on it, I took my wife
to the hospital for the birth of our first child in a T bucket roadster
that she hated with a passion. The new Pontiac just wouldn't start and we
pushed it back far enough to get the roadster past and drove across our
lawn to get out.
Turns out she spent 14 hours in labor, we could have taken the Schwinn.
