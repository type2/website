Hi Richard,
Here is what the bus shop manual has to say.  
  It has been observed in isolated cases that the red charging control lamp 
glows when the vehicle is in motion.  If the generator and voltage regulator 
are in order, the cause can only be an excessively high voltage drop in the 
connections between regulator terminal B+ and the charging control lamp.  
This voltage drop can appear at the following points in the electrical system:
Regulator, terminal B+
Starter, terminal 30 
Fuse box, terminal 30 (Fuse 1 lower)
Lighting switch, terminal 30
Ignition/starter switch, terminal 30
Ignition/starter switch, terminal 15/54

All these connections should be checked as follows:
1-Start engine and run it at fast idling speed.
2-Switch on headlamps,windscreen wipers and turn indicators.
3-Strip insulation at both ends of piece of 2.5 mm (Can someone please 
translate this to USA gauge?) cable about 13 foot long and connect it to 
terminal B+ on regulator. 
4-Contact all the connections listed here with the free end of the cable, one 
after the other and have an assistant watch the charging control lamp. 
5-If the charging lamp ceases to glow when one of the connections is touched 
with the canble, the fault is found.

Between this connection and the one tested before it, is the voltage drop 
which is causing the control lamp to glow.

The voltage drop can be caused by loose connections, poor contacts in 
switches or damaged cables.  Damaged parts should be replaced and loose or 
corroded connections repaired.  

Note:  On VW models with seperately mounted variode regulators, (Type 2/1500) 
a poor ground connection between regulator and body can cause the control 
lamp to glow. In such cases the regulator should be taken off and the contact 
points on the reguator mounting lugs cleaned.
