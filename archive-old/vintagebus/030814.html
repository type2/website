I installed the corner windows on my dad's 3/55 non bd 23 window.  I had
just purchased the last 6 corner windows available from VW at the
unbelieveable price of $17.00 each!!!

They went in just like the other glass.  Of course, I got cocky after
doing those and immediately broke 2 roof windows.  Figures they were the
heavy green tint style too.  I spent months looking for those.

I sat on those corner windows for 15 years before selling them for $125
each in the un-opened boxes.

&gt; windows for a 15 or 21 window?  Given the cost of the corners I am loath to
&gt; even try these without some foreknowledge.... hints/thoughts/experiences ?
