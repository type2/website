Hi Volks,

I've converted 6V bus wiper motors to 12V by swapping out the armature
(I think that's what you call it - I mean the thing that turns in the
motor) with the armature from a 12V bug wiper motor. The cool thing
about  this technique is that you still have all the original bus
shafts and stuff. It's also a lot easier to find a bug 12V motor to
rob than it is to find a 12V bus motor. Of course, you have to use the
same type motors, but that's obvious, isn't it ? 8^)
