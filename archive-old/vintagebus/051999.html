Subject: RE: [VB] Tie rods

chances are the right tie rod has both ends fixed to the rod, so the only
solution to that side is to replace the entire rod. on the left side, you
can replace the ends, but you'll have to do an alignment of some sort
afterwords to get it right, unless you can manage to get the end to the
exact same length on the rod, but would be best to check afterwords
regardless.
other thing's i'd check would be: draglink, especially the end at the swing
lever, centerpin for wiggle and/or up/down movement (check with wheels on
ground and somebody turning you steering wheel back and forth).


&gt; [Original Message] 
&gt; Now it's time to tame the steering!  Currently the truck seems to take my
&gt; steering input as merely a good suggestion as we wander down the highway.
&gt; I've been under the front end and taken the backlash out of the steering
&gt; box. (But not too tight - I've read the posts!)  While under there I
noticed
&gt; side to side play in both front wheels.  (No up and down play - the
bearings
&gt; were checked and adjusted when the brake wheel cylinders were replaced on
&gt; both sides).  All of the movement seems to be coming from looseness in the
&gt; outer tie rod ends on both sides.  Both inner tie rod ends appear tight -
no
&gt; real play in any direction.  
&gt; 
&gt; Question:	Can I get away with just changing the ends, or should I buy
&gt; new tie rods for both sides 


--got pretzels? (cough, choke....PLOP!!)
