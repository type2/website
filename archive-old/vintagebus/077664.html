Hi everyone. Maureen, and I are traveling through Monterey Ca, and lost all 
the gears in our tranny. We have a place to stay with friends, but need a 
tranny to get back to Canada for Christmas. We are driving a '65 bus converted to 
I.R.S. If some one has a used tranny for sale ready to go into a bus, or a good 
reduction box tranny, I would be willing to switch back to the original 
setup. If we go this route I could trade the rear disc brake setup (porsche 914 
rotors, jetta calipers), or some kind of part trade. The bus is stranded in the 
Del Monte Mall, at the Munras exit. I will check the internet from time to 
time. I will also leave a couple of phone numbers...cell 1-604-785-6846, friend 
Mike 831-657-9404. Thank you. 
Jason Radawiec
