Hey y'all...

I just got me some &quot;Easy Liquid Sander&quot; by Kleen Strip.  I intend to use it
on the parts of my bus that are still quite solid with original paint
adhering nicely.  Does anyone have knowledge of this product?  I will use
primer immediately afterwards....not to mention sanding any questionable
areas....advice is welcome!

Also, I will be using POR-15 as a base for all of those spots like the edges
of doors and such that tend to get gakked up by constant abrasion...I figure
that the toughness of POR-15 will at least protect the metal even though the
topcoat may get damaged.

And one more thing....the driver's side front door of my '67 was rubbing at
the bottom.  There is a specific spot (about 2&quot; wide) that was getting
enough wear to cause it to become indented.  Is there a way to adjust the
door height/angle?
The door itself was from a Deluxe (year unknown) and my bus is a Kombi...I
don't think it should matter, but....

Thanks,
Gene
