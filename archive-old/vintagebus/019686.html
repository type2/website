Subject: Buses and Drivetrain Mods - a suggestion
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com (SplitWindows Rule/LagWagens Drool)

A common topic here on the list deals with putting bigger engines
or strange transaxle configurations in buses.  I get tons of email
on this via my site as well.  90% of the time, these come from people 
who just got their first bus, and are hell bent for leather to turn it
into something they saw in the magazine.

I'd like to offer the following suggestion:  if you're new to VW's, 
or if you're new to buses, start from the ground up.  Get the basics
of the bus working, in stock form.  Drive the bus that way for a 
while, so you can see what it's *supposed* to be like.  Then once
you're comfortable with your mechanical abilities and you have a 
good baseline, then consider doing mods.

I can't count the number of emails I've received from people who
want to know how to remove the reduction boxes, because they're
&quot;junk&quot; - even though their bus hasn't moved under it's own power
yet!  Or the people who say the stock engine sucks because it
doesn't have any power, and they want to put a (big engine here)
in it, yet they never bothered to fix the original engine.  They
have no idea of what kind of power it should have, because they're
told by the ads in the magazines that the stock config is inferior.

I'm not saying you shouldn't do any modifications - there are some really
well-executed drivetrain mods out there, but most of them are done by
people who actually knew what they were doing, or had very good
coaching along the way -  I'm just saying that if you're new to VW's and/or 
new to buses, give the stock configuration a try, if for no other reason 
than to learn the system.  All of that stuff is there for a reason, and 
these buses were running around for years before the armchair engineers 
got ahold of 'em.  Learn to walk before you try to fly.
