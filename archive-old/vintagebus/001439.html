Hey now,

I carry all that stuff, and then some.  AND it all fits quite nicely
underneath a Westy Jump-Seat (or in my case the rear facing SO-33 seat) in a
standard Craftsman 3 drawer tool-box, a small fishing tackle box for seals,
silicone, nuts &amp; bolts and stuff, plus my complete Dizzy, starter, carb,
fuel pump, wheel bearings, generator, idiot book, and coils go in the
compartment under the front seat.   I also carry a full 2 ton floor jack in
the Westy under said seat on extended journeys.

It doesn't take up nearly as much space as it sounds.

And with that, I also carry a full SO-33 camping interior, cookware, tiki
torches, citronella fuel, a small grill, Coleman 'dual-fuel' lantern and
burner, propane bottles, food, tea, plates, utensils, etc, Westy side tent,
5 gal water bottle, dog food, dog corkscrew chain thingy, chain, dog,
blankets, sleeping bags, rain coats, BEER, LeatherMan super-tool, small
stool, spare tire(s), food, gigantic Mag-Lite, batteries, Palm-Pilot, GPS
receiver, CD's, large Coleman cooler, vintage luggage and cameras,
cam-corder and other photo equipment, clothes, toiletries, and once every
other leap-year or so, I actually have a travel companion with me.

So you see, the list ain't so bad after all, now is it?   I recently pulled
all my stuff out to make new panels, and was astonished at how mstuff really
was in there after all!

Very good listing Eric, I would never have had the patience to type up a
list of all the crap I carry these days!

-Brian

And you expect to have room for luggage AND people as well?  You'd be lucky
to fit all that stuff in a bus with you passengers, and if driving a pickup,
I guess be prepared to fill the entire cargo area up with parts!  Why not
just carry a cell phone instead of the 50 items on the list?  Maybe a spare
tire, jack, and crowbar.  I'd have trouble finding space in my garage for
all that stuff, let alone carrying it around in a bus!  Why not do a
walk-around each time you drive the vehicle, and set up monthly and/or other
frequencies of maintenance checks.  I know on my 73 bug, I check out
essential items before I drive it each time and make sure I go over the
entire vehicle about every 8 weeks.  Seems to work for me.  I plan to take
the same approach with Fritz once he's alive again.
