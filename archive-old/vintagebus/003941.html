I tend to agree here myself.  If the later, so called, I.R.S. suspension is
supposed to have been so much better, why does VW still put the swingaxle in
the 'NEW' old beetles that they sell in Mexico?

Hmmmmmm

1957 VW Oval Ragtop
1967 VW Pop Top Westy
1964 VW Double Door, Walk-Thru Panel (soon to be 4 sale)
1969 VW Karmann Ghia Convertible (4 sale http://www.thebugbox_dot_com/ghia )

&gt; The later post '67 double jointed rear axles were added to improve
handling
&gt; (the rear tires remain more or less upright as they deflect), NOT ride
&gt; quality.  I also  suspect VW wanted to get in on the &quot;CV&quot;
&gt; bandwagon...there's great profit margins in selling replacement joints.
