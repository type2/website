Hi NQ,
Definitely sounds like you just need to go through the wiring and 
clean/tighten everything up.  Beware the repair battery clamps that clamp to 
your old battery cable.  Over time these easily corrode in this area and 
without cleaning the problems you list just happen.  We buy brass battery 
repair clamps and solder them directly to the cable.  Resulting in no 
possible way for corrosion to get between the cable end and the clamp.
