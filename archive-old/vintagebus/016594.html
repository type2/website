Subject: Headlight switch puzzle

Hello everyone,

I have a question about light switches.  My bus came with some non-vw switch
that was cobbled together with lots of wiring.  I am wondering what kind of
headlight switch I should be looking for.  Here are the details.

My bus was originally a euro spec bus, I have the three wire turn signal
switch, and euro tail lights.  The wiring diagrams on thom's site show the
correct headlight switch having four (4) terminals.

PO changed the headlight buckets out for american style (with parking
lights).  Thom's diagrams show this as a switch with five (5) terminals.  I
am not objected to keeping the current headlights with parking lights, not
going for a concourse resto here.

I checked my parts manual (thanks steven howell), and there is only one part
# listed for the light switch.  Does that mean that the euro busses came
equipped with a five (5) terminal switch, but only used 4 of them? Hmmm.

Let's say I keep the current headlights.  When I find a switch, do I need
one with screw terminals, or with pull tab terminals, or is there a
difference?

Thanks!

Mike Anderson
