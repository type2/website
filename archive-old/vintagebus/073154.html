Subject: Re: [VB] Fan and alternator problems

&gt; Everything was running fine until I started getting
&gt; some odd scraping noises that sounded like the fan
&gt; rubbing, and when I felt inside the fan housing it
&gt; didn't feel too good.

&gt; discovered that the fan had torn loose from the hub,
&gt; which was still tightly fastened under the nut on the
&gt; alternator shaft.  Well, before we were done we found
&gt; damage to the alternator, and the fan had done some
&gt; damage to the backing plate

&gt; So--my question is, can I use the fan and backing
&gt; plate from spare generator equipped engines that I
&gt; have around, or must these parts be from an alternator
&gt; equipped engine?

Although the alternator conversion kits include new tin, I can't see any
difference between the 30A generator and alternator tin.  There _is_ a
difference between the 38A (bus generator) and 30A (bug generator) tin.

If the alternator has been damaged, I would opt for a new internal
regulator Bosch alternator.  Since you are already set up for an
alternator it will be an easy install.
