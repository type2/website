&lt;&lt; Has anyone ever ran the valves on a 1500 at .012 like the owners manual
 says? Thanks. &gt;&gt;
Hi John,
We have only run the early 40 HP engines with the .008&quot; &amp; .012&quot; valve
adjustments.  The very early 1500 had to use the same due it using the same
earlier long studs that retain the rockers assemblies.  So unless you have the
square bossed later heads or the short repair studs in the earlier round
bossed long stud heads.  You would be better off with the .008&quot; &amp; .012&quot; valve
adjustments.  Eric &amp; Barb
