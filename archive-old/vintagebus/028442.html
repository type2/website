&gt; I tried BAP for new German front bearings for my 62.

I don't think that you can go all that far wrong with Japanese bearings,
seeing as how the most reliable cars in the world come equipped with them
:)
 
&gt; Looking for the driver side grease cap.  If I knew how
&gt; to punch a square hole, I could modify a passenger side
&gt; cap.  The speedo is working right now because the cable
&gt; is epoxied to the cap :-)

Not hard.  Find the center of the cap, centerpunch, and drill a hole that
is the same size as the distance across the flats of the cable.  then use
a small file to square up the hole to accept the cable.  Probably easier
still to scrounge up a left hand cap.
