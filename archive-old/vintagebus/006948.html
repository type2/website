Subject: 3.88/77  4th trans report

	Well I got a couple thousand on the trans now and still I am not
sure I like it. There is a 39 per cent drop between 3rd and 4th gear so you
really have to watch the R's. Allready ruined 1 set of P/L's and just
replaced those before my last journey. 600 miles r/t, cruising on the flats
at 75 mph without a problem, hit a hill though and watch out. The best thing
is 3rd gear, I could pull long hills in 3rd at 55 mph without a problem,
still haven't hooked up the Autometer tach yet as I didn't realize I needed
a tach adapter when useing an electronic ignition DUH!. Another problem I
had was I rejetted the carbs because I was running rich (I thought), after
doing this my milage dropped from 19-22 to a consitent 13!!!! and I went to
smaller mains and air correction, maybe I did to drastic a change, but who
would have thought that downsizing jets would lead to worse fuel economy.
I'm going to get the tach hooked up and go back to the old jets and start
from there going down 2.5 jet sizes at a time instead of 20!. I have a trip
to Phoenix in a couple weeks, so I'll bring jets and change them every 100
miles to try to find the best combination, besides the dialing problems I am
extremely happy with the big valved, single port 1776, have tons of power in
all gears till I hit 4th on a hill, I'll keep the list (those who care)
informed on the progress of this odd combination I have.
