Subject: thrust bearing startup wear?
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.05.10003092201330.404-100000_at_lenti.type2_dot_com&gt;

Here's something I've been pondering:

One problem that shows up as VW engine age is excessive endplay.  The
occurs when the face of the thrust bearing wears.

I was taught (mumble) years ago that it was proper to disengage the clutch
when I started the engine.  Thinking about this, however makes me wonder
how wise this is.

When you disengage the clutch with the engine stopped, you are putting
pressure against the thrust bearing.  This, I would think, pushes the oil
out from between the shims and the bearing.  If you then start the engine
in this condition, the thrust bearing will be starved of oil until the oil
pressure comes up and hydrodynamic effects carry oil into the bearing
interface.  This doesn't seem good for the bearing.

As an alternative, we could keep our foot off of the clutch and start in
neutral.  This would keep pressure off of the thrust bearing until it was
running properly with a good oil supply.

Any gearheads have thoughts on this?
