Subject: Re: Oil pressure sender - general question

&gt;I got a VDO oil pressure dual sender and gauge at the pick-n-pull from
&gt;an 83 Audi.  Looks just like the brand-new one I bought from Bus Depot.
&gt;Installed it on my type 1 motor in my 58 single cab and thought, &quot;Cool!
&gt;Guage and sender for $7&quot;.
&gt;
&gt;Problem is, while the gauge works just fine, the dummy light works in
&gt;reverse.  It goes off when pressure drops below the threshold level of
&gt;the sendor, but stays on the rest of the time.

They apparently used a normally open contact instead of a normally closed.
Buy a brass tee and install the new one for the pressure guage, use the
original one for the idiot light ,and make the contact that lights on oil
pressure power your radio, so if you lose oil pressure while you are
listening to your Lawrence Welk plays Coolio and the Gang CD, your attention
will be directed back to the task at hand. =^O
