Subject: bent gas pedal

After viewing the photo, I belive someone actually
bent it. The reason the sides didn't bow out is
because of the direction of the bend, and the fact
that it isn't too severe of a bend. Had it been bent
the opposite direction, I think the sides would show
some buckle.
 Mike
