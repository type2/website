No.

My one and only purchase from GEX was a stock 1600DP.  It supposedly had
new heads, but the valve stems were all uneven.  The oil light flicered at
idle from the first week of operation.

It made it for 40,000 gently-driven miles in a bug before losing
compression on cylinders 3 and 4.

Judging from other's experience, I was relatively lucky.

Save your nickles, buy a new engine!
