Subject: re: VW Trends - Compilation

Back in the early 1990's, when I was more apted to be at VW shows,I had
occassion to suggest to the other magazine the concept of creating and
releasing previously published articles or complete magazines via website or
other available media.
My suggestion was to create a &quot;secondary market&quot; and enforce, not undercut, the
desire of collecting the old magazines. To me, it was a touchdown of an idea to
create additional revenue from existing proprietary assets.
I was thinking of special off-shoots of photos only, bikini babes from back in
the day, separate CD or subdirectory of tech articles or whatever could be
imagined.
I pitched a members only password &quot;protected&quot; access by subscription number.

My idea was met with blank stares and was quickly dismissed by the easliy
recognized names at the magazines' booth. Keep in mind that the web was NOT as
developed or as familiar as it is today. The old ISF-Mosaic browser had just
been sold off to an upstart company- Netscape. Compact discs were not popcorn
and no-brainer as much as today.

I still encourage any and all magazines to consider doing this... IF they have
the rights of reproduction and liability releases for the photographs of the
people/cars. At least VWTrends has changed publishers at least once... so the
back issues may NOT be property of the current publisher.

I hesitate to mention theSamba_dot_com and muse publicly about what thoughts may
have been discussed privately between my friend, Mr. Barnes, and self/others. I
did suggest selling banner ads prior to their appearence. I was one of the
first to suggest &quot;thanking&quot; Everett for any sales that he may have made
possible. 

Separately, without any connection to any popular website, let me bluntly say
that financial compensation for services rendered (such as providing a free
website) are taxable income. Sometimes in a given mythical-hypothetical
situation a webmaster/site provider may NOT wish to, at this time, deal with
added tax hassles. Suggesting that someone &quot;give thanks&quot; may not be taken
literally. It would require persons using a site to CLUE IN and figure out that
saying &quot;Thanks dude&quot; may not be what is intended.
Support the Troops, eh? Comprehende, Si?

Changing a very popular free website into a pay per view may be trickier than
converting everyone to Sirrius Radio. Good luck to all parties concerned.
