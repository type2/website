Subject: West Sacramento listees, truck visit please

I hope my last set of check-out visit favors...

Anyone in West Sacramento area available to check over the body of a splitee
Crew for me?  I'm pressed to make a decision in the next 48 hours and the
best candidate is this one.

Description of area is &quot;West Sacramento, 15 minutes from airport&quot; by the
owner.  Still waiting on exact address.   Sooner the better, Tuesday evening
or Wednesday morning would be awesome (willing to pay someone $20 or equal
favor if that makes any difference).

Thanks, and I also know I have half of San Jose to thank too!  There are so
many great listees to thank down there!!
