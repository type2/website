VW did create some confusion when it chose for  its designation of model 
year (rather than  a calendar year)  a &quot;working year&quot;. The latter, beginning 
after completion of the summer shut-down, commenced, with an occasional 
hiccup  in August .In  August '64 VW also changed its numbering system to 
conform with the rest of the world such that the model year was indicated in 
the VIN no.This allowed you to figure out the &quot;year&quot; of your bus without 
having to goto production tables.  Busses built from August '64  were 
designated '65 model year and have a 5 as the third digit of the VIN no. So 
it is possible to have a bus built in '64 that is actually a '65 in terms of 
fit-out. I guess most of us are not too specific when referring to the year 
of our bus and probably add to the confusion-for some of the earlier years 
the &quot;production year&quot; was designated and cannot be known by referring to the 
plates on the bus so those of us with no access to production tables can 
often work out the year the bus was built from the chassis no but be unsure 
of the model year for those busses built in the latter half of each year. 
Confused and loving it
