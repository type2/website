Hey All:

Just got a call last night from a buddy whose liquidating his bus stash as he's going to Europe and needs to unload.  Here's what he has, and try to keep in mind I've only seen this bus once and I couldn't get close to it due to other buses in the way:

1959 23 Window Deluxe.  Sealing Wax Red/ Beige Gray.  No rust around any window openings.  Right rocker had rust and has already been removed but not replaced.  Previous owner (uh-oh) tried to make it a walk through so the bulkhead was hacked.  David has meticulously cut out the entire bulkhead and has a perfect donor one cut out and ready to be installed.  All glass is there except one windshield.  All Deluxe trim is there.  Interior is there except for the long drivers side panel.  No middle or rear seats.  Comes with a fresh rebuilt 36 hp motor with correct numbered case but not original # for the bus.  Also comes with loads of NOS parts, i.e. rear taillights, door and window rubber, NOS front bumper, original radio, too much to list, plus I don't know!  Price is $7500.  Serious inquiries only.  (805)962-7263 or voice pager (805)563-2684.  Best to call him not me, and I know he isn't interested in selling off parts so please don't call and ask.

Thanks.

Robert
