hey all,
i thought i would let everyone know that i just got a really nice hatch seal 
off eBay from some place in Cali called ISP West. found one on eBay a few 
weeks ago and lost out at the last minute... saw this one a couple weeks ago 
and got it for $61.50. (i think i outbid Everett too! :-] &quot;planetvw&quot;) i must 
say it fits PERFECTLY, we will have to see how dry it keeps things though! 
it was advertised as NOS though, its hardly that, but it is new.

there seems to be another seal that pops up after one sells from ISP West on 
eBay. what are they? do they have a catalog? website? what else do they 
stock? where do they get these, and how do they sell them soooo cheap?

anyway, if you need one, search eBay for them.

later,
