Subject: Needed PANEL DOORS!!
Message-ID: &lt;7k9n7d$tq2t_at_eGroups_dot_com&gt;

I Need panel doors for a 56-60 panel bus(high hinge).  The door is the smooth outside w/out the handle(right rear or front left).  Looking for nos or very cherry no big dents and NO RUST AT THE BOTTOM of the door.  Some surface rust is ok but no cancer.  No good doors at OCTO or CLASSIC. I will pay shipping or or drive to get it if in california or Arizona or New Mexico.  I NEED THIS DOOR AND IT IS THE LAST BODY PART I NEED OTHER THAN A FRONT DRIVERS SIDE DOG LEG N.O.S. OR VERY CHERRY.

   Thanks
