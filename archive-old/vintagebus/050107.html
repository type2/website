Subject: Re: [VB] re: newbie ques about 65 &amp;  Thanks

&gt;Hi all,
&gt;I would like to thank everyone for all their help in answering some of my
&gt;questions about my new 65 Terrapin, until my Bentley and owners manual
&gt;arrived.
&gt;
&gt;One thing that didn't make the list was What was the speed set for on a 1500
&gt;governor?  The answer according to Bentley is 65 mph or 105 kph in top gear.
&gt;And speaking of the governor.  Everyone told me to pull mine off and make it
&gt;easier.  I would like to keep mine but it is still missing the cover.  If
&gt;everyone seems to pulling theirs off there must be a spare someone would be
&gt;willing to sell :)
&gt;
&gt;Please let me know as I would like the original cover instead of trying to
&gt;make one and hope it fits right.


There used to be governor eliminator pipes sold.  I saw one on Ebay a
couple of months back.  It is necessary because the type 2 intake manifold
is shorter than the type 1 manifold, to give space for the governor.  If
you try to bolt the carb directly to the type 2 manifold, the throttle
cable will not line up properly, and you might also have interference
between the carb and the generator, particularly if your carb has an
electric idle jet solenoid.

If you don't like the governor, you can strip the guts out and fill up the
holes with JB Weld or bondo, or you can try to find an eliminator pipe, or
you can find a '67-'70 type 1 intake manifold (best).  In your case, you
should be able to trace the strange shape of the governor onto a piece of
galvanized sheet metal, cut it out with a tin snips, punch or drill bolt
hioles, and then use some silicone and screws to seal your new cover in
place.

I missed getting a NOS governor on Ebay a while back, but I did get a used
one.  Unfortunately, the safty wire is gone and I think this thing has been
monkeyed with.  I'm running a '74 type 1 engine at the moment, but I plan
to build a stock 1500 (well, maybe 1600 or 1641, or would be really nice to
build a 1500S) H block to make evcerything original again.
