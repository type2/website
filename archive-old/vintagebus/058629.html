Hi List,

     kind of off topic, but I need to here from some people with experience, 
I asked a question similar to this before, some time ago, but I am getting 
ready to sell a car (not a VW) (a 1965 ford galaxie 500 conv)and I would 
like to do it on ebay, what does the list think of this move, to sell a car 
on ebay?  It is partially restored, runs great and drives around, needs a 
top and some interier pieces, plus a finished paint job, (its in primer),

thanks!
Matt in Pa
