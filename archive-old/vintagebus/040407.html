Gimme a break!  All those responses about whether
to use two stage this or five part harmony, or
whatever for a cheap temporary paint job.

Go down to your local cheapo hardware box store,
find a rattle can that's close, do small sections
at a time, and rattle-can it!

You may have to try a few colors to get one close
enough, but when you do, buy a bunch.

Those that have the fancy compressor and such,
kinda assume that everybody has such a setup.

This is really a situation for KISS.
Keep It So Simple
