Subject: RE: [VB] 6V starter

I'll get the new one today... if it isn't a tight fit I'll ream out the
hole a bit and have my friend make me a custom one.  Or has anyone tried
the 'ol JBWeld fix for something like this????

Hi David,
Yike!  That is supposed to be a press fit part!  Hope the new one
pressed in 
or the tranny case is damaged!



&gt; Sure enough, I pulled the starter for the umpteenth time, stuck my
little 
&gt; finger in the hole and pulled it easily out.  The thing was shot... I
mean WAY 
&gt; bad.
