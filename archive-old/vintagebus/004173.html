Subject: My First Burned Out Vehicle

Thankfully it wasn't mine.  I was upstairs yesterday taking with my SO when
I smelled what seemed like burning plastic.  I went to the window and I saw
smoke coming from a New Van, it was a fo*d, or do*dge, or che* (they all
look the same to me). As I looked I saw it burst into flames.  I grabbed my
phone and ran down stairs pressing 911 as I went.   I handed the phone to my
wife and said: &quot;tell them to send a fire truck.&quot;  I ran into the backyard
and grabbed my fire extinguisher which was beside my bus as I keep it close
at hand as I am using solvents to help with my undercoating removal.  So I
ran across the alley, maybe 100 feet, and realized my fire extinguisher was
useless. So I pulled the pin and hit the side of the garage thinking I could
slow down the fire until the fire truck arrived.  Complete waste of time!
So I ran back home and grabbed my hose which is also beside my bus.  My wife
was on the step by this time and I yelled for her to turn on the water,
which she did while yelling at me not to get to close - we both feared an
explosion.  Once the hose was on I started spraying down the garage and a
neighbour told me to forget about that garage but to hit the one beside
it -directly across from our yard.  That made sense so I hosed down the roof
and side of that garage.

The Fire Department came and I got out of the way but of course there were
look-y- loos by this point in fact two cars had driven down the alley -
unbelievable I thought.  I yelled: &quot;Get the F*ck Outta here - the fire
trucks can't get  by.&quot;  What is wrong with people!  Anyway, the fire was put
out and the garage beside the van was destroyed but the one I hosed was
saved!  They were only a couple feet apart.   The women that lives in the
house afterwards asked if it was me that was hosing the garage.  I said it
was and she said that I saved her deck as the water was going over the
garage I was spraying and hitting her deck! Her deck was unscathed but the
siding of her house was  melted.

Hey,  I took it as an omen (kinda like an hawk flying over my left shoulder
while the rosy fingered dawn greets the day) - first I'm waiting for my new
gas line, and second - don't mess with a useless fire extinguisher.  These
little ones are junk.

It turns out that the van belonged to some duct cleaners and inside they had
a compressor with a small gas tank and this big unit with a fan.  Apparently
there was a person inside of the van who had asked the home owner to call
911 - So, if he had a fire extinguisher then he could have put the fire out
with almost no damage.  He certainly could have saved the van and the
garage.

Anyway a bit of excitment in a mostly boring life.
