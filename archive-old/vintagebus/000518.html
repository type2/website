&lt;&lt; The heads are right for a 40hp (going by what the guy at BFY had to say - 
the intake studs point straight up).  What I don't know is if the P&amp;Cs are 
right.  The
 previous owner, who installed it after blowing up the bastard 40hp, at one 
point said it was a (non-bastard) 40hp, and at another said it was a 1300.  
These are not consistent statements. &gt;&gt;
Hi Dworkin,
What you are going to have to do is remove one of the heads.  Scrape off the 
carbon to get the piston size or measure the bore of the cylinder.  Then turn 
the crank and measure the low and high points of piston travel.  If it is 
64mm between these points it has a 40HP crank.  If instead the measurement is 
69mm then it is a 1500/1600 crank.  
  We actually have a 1515cc Orkasa longblock we have built on a 40HP case 
using a 69mm crank, 40HP 83mm big bore P&amp;Cs and it still uses a 40HP muffler!
