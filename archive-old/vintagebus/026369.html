i would say go for the valves and a carb adjustment first because they
are free. and it dont hurt anyway.

then go for cap rotor, points, condenser. well, do those anyway too!
they arent real expensive.  (but stay away from the clear caps!)

&gt; '70 1600 sp.  Feels like I'm on 3 cyl. but I checked all the plugs, cleaned 'em, checked wires for broken ends (its happened), made sure coil was all plugged in right.  Mechanic friend said check the fuel filter.  Changed it and tightened lines (little air leak next to carb).  Still nothing.  Well, not nothing, it has improved a little but still, 4th gear only means it will maintain the speed I climbed to in 3rd.  What I am trying to say is that it won't excellerate in 4th gear.  Could the coil be bad.  Also static timed it, it was perfect.  Oh, and now the oil light comes on at idle after my last trip around the block to check on things, yet the dipstick reads full.  Any ideas?
