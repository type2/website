    Hey All,
         West Coast Classics has finally started my 61 panel.This bus is to
be used and PAID for by my business,so I can afford the talents of WCC.Lenny
is emailing me updates every week.Looks like it'll
need a new front clip.But the only rust on the entire bus is one small hole
in the cargo door jam.This bus
I bought in New Mexico where it spent its entire life in the desert.it was
obviouly a work truck,hence it is dented to hell(a surveyers truck,&quot;Gila
Land Surveying&quot;,any desert dwellers heard of them or know of this bus?).
  I hope to be picking this bus from WCC in June in time for the Classic.(at
least it better be done).I will then be bringing it back to the Chicago area
where I will be finishing all the mechanics.Though I may opt to install a
rebuilt rearend when I'm in LA to save me the expense of shipping a rearend
back to Chicago from Rancho. Anyway check out , see link below .
    Also I'm in need of a pair of cargo doors for this 61 panel(ie. low
hinge, no forward indent, no window, set of doors)
        Thanks for your interest,
