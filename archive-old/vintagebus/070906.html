Subject: RE: [VB] And the saga begins

Hmmmm, restored... wouldn't that ultimately mean 'brought back to some
*previous* state'?  Then again, Ronnie is 'restoring' it to an operable
state!

Go Ronnie Go.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (notice I didn't say restored) as it is not original color,
interior,
engine, trans
&gt; and front end etc. so I choose to use the term REBUILT as a
replacement
&gt; word for a totaly redone non original VW

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Hey Ronnie,

In my opinion, you can call it a restoration. The folks over on the R&amp;R
forum are just touchy. It's not like you're going to call it a 'vintage
restoration', right? I'll consider it a restoration, and I know most
people
will too.
