&lt;For those of you who have the &quot;merged extractor&quot; style exhaust&gt;

I agree with Eric&amp;Barb. One other suggestion is that there might be vibration that causes the gasket to scuff out, the flanges to warp, and or the bolts to come loose. This can be solved by attaching a hanger to the muffler somewhere past the balance point and mounting to a solid frame/body member. A hanger with a short rubber section has worked well for me.
