&gt;&gt; Well, hopefully your soon-to-be widow has at least taken out a large life

&gt;Nope, took care of that detail myself.

I am starting to think that I have been trolled - in other words, you
were joking about the 25 year old tires just to get a reaction from
the list.

&gt;&gt; Please get some newer tires for your double cab.
&gt;
&gt;A complete set of 5 new light truck tires has been on my to-do list
&gt;since before I've had two kids in college (about 4 years, in fact).

At the risk of making a bigger fool out of myself if I indeed have
been trolled, this makes me think of a credit-card ad:

Complete set of 5 new light truck tires                 $350
Mounting, balancing, and valve stems                     $50
New four-way lug wrench                                  $20
Living long enough to see your kids graduate college    Priceless
