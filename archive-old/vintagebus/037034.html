Hi Gene,
We bet you are going to keep those lug bolts greased from now on!  Just make 
sure not to use a tap to clean the threads in the drums unless the tap used 
is nominal or on the small fit size.  Otherwise the lug bolts will wiggle 
loose due to the slightly bigger diameter threads.  Or you can grind or file 
a thread cleaning groove in a spare lugbolt like the grooves in the engine 
tin screws.
