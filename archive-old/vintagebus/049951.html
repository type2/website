Subject: Re: [VB] 6V vs 12V

&gt;Tell me now if I'm paranoid with this keeping the bus 6V and as close to
&gt;original as possible? I might have to convert anyway after I'm done
&gt;rebuilding this 1600 DP or is there a way to build it using 6V parts?
&gt;flywheel might be the only thing I need to change. Should I or should I?


I'm trying to think of an engine which can't be built as eather a 6v or
12v.  Hell, even a 36 horse can be 12v with a small diameter 12v generator!

As for a 6v DP, I've seen quite a few of them.  The hardest part to locate
is the 200mm 6v O-Ring flywheel, which is pretty rare as an OEM part, but I
believe that there are aftermarket units available.  You can use your
original 12v generator stand with a late 6v bus or 356 Porsche generator,
or just bolt on a 6v generator stand and use a standard 6v generator.  The
only problem I can think of is the electromagnetic idle jet on the 34
series carb.  Those are big bastards with a plunger type thingie sticking
out of them.  I don't think there's a 6v version of that jet.  You might
have to fit an earlier carb, either with an adaptor, or with a Euro
manifold (I have one on my DP engine).

My current screwed up setup is 6v flywheel, 6v starter, 12v alternator,
battery, and lights.  The wipers run too fast, the dome light lenses were
melted by the previous owner, and the thing is a bastard.  I'm determined
to return the whole system to 6v eventually.  It's a 99% complete '66 Westy
(well, except for the '74 engine), and they're getting valuable, especially
in unmodified condition.
