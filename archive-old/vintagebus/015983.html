Salve Populi!

With regard to my previous post asking about case sealant, and the welcome replies telling me that I should use Permatex Aviation Sealant, I respond to the question:  &quot;are you sure the PO did not use any sealant?&quot;...
:He specifically stated that he used nothing!  

So...to cure my engine of more leakage than I think I can put up with, I've got to rip it all apart and put it back together with Permatex!  Right?  
I guess that it would be fun...I can make sure everything is torqued per the recent article in either VW Trends or Hot VW's that talks of bolt/stud stretch and the difference between friction and true torque.  Oh well.....should I still use a new gasket kit?  This engine has less than 10 miles on it.

p.s.  Please do not reply to the address of this message....if you want to reply to me without broadcasting on the list, my email is mizamook_at_sonic_dot_net.  (My handheld computer has a weird setting somewhere!)
