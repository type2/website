&lt;&lt; hi,
 
 I'm having trouble with the throttle cable return.
 I put a spring on the pedal and that helped, but 
 the cable still gets loose when everything warms up,
 so the effect is like the pedal goes down and it seems
 like you can't get as much power (but I know it's just
 the cable length.)  How tight should the cable be at 
 the clevis?  
------
good way to adjust it is put a friends foot or a brick on the gas pedal.  
then go to the motor and pull the lever down all the way and attach the cable 
right, so puutting your foot to the metal pulls the arm all the way down.  
Not past the max so yourip the pdeal out of the rusty floor, nor so you dont 
get enough gas.  

Check to make sure it spring all the way back (with choke held out of the way 
by hand.)   Is the cable stuck in the forward rubber seal?   It happens, cut 
a notch in the seal forward of the fan shroud.
 =======
 Transporter workshop manual says there's a barrel spring at the fanshroud
 end, but I don't think I have one.  Also wonder if that's an oldschool
 thing. The barrel bushing produdes 5cm from the back of the shroud, should
 it be flush?  Pushing it in a bit seems to help, so I put a fuel line
 clamp behind the shroud to hold the bushing in, and that helped a bit too.
  &gt;

yes, pushing the tube all the way into the fan shroud and a hose clamp on the 
gas tank side against the fan shroud is good.  yes earlier VW used the spring 
between the fan shround and cab, didn't have one on the carb.  On my 65 westy 
I have BOTH, as I have the nifty cutom barefoot cover on the gas pedal, which 
weighs the pedal down.
