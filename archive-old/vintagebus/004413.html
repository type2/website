This afternoon all I had time to do was hook up the trailer to Li'l Red and
haul my baywindow gas tank to the DIY carwash.  I blasted that tank so full
of hot soapy water that the tank itself became too hot to hold.  There were
gummy chunks falling out all over but I really gave it what for and finally
got nice clean water to run through.  I'm going to do the old hot soapy
water and chain trick later to make sure I really have the innards flushed
out good.  Later...
