After a few years with the California Conservation Corps, then a couple with
the US Forest Circus, then some more with the California Department of Foresty,
I don't quite have the same view on camping and hiking as most folks.  I guess
doing it for a living kinda takes the &quot;oooh! aaah!&quot; factor out of it.
