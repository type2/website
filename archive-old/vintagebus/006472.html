Slight surface rust???... on another note, I pulled one off a 67 at the
wrecking yard that looked like that, with the same cut out, the same amount
of rust, ( it was for the 63) the guys in the yard their just rolled their
eyes and laughed that anybody would want some thing like that !   They DID
charge me $50. for the Deluxe rear bumper though.... Lloyd in Eureka, Calif.

&gt;Wasn't there someone here looking for a '67 specific pedal pan?  I just
&gt;spotted one on eBay.  It's a good deal right now but you know how that goes
&gt;:-)  Sez it provides space for the dual-circuit master cylinder.

&gt;
&gt;...and that's all I know.
