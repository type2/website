 &gt; ok heres the scoop....
 &gt;
 &gt; i have a new mexico 1600dp with a type 4 oil cooler.
 &gt; when i put oil in 2.5 quarts filled it to the top mark.
==============
for me that is closer to 3 qts than 2.5, but whatever.
.........................
 &gt; i have a gene berg dip stick sensor. i coldent drive
 &gt; more than 5 miles without the light coming on.
 &gt;==============
that's just wrong
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 &gt; now all my tin is correctly installed all my seals are
 &gt; in place. my timing is set a 7.5 btc. nothing is in my
 &gt; fan either, now here are my questions.
 =================
I would double check everything.  areyou supposed to set the timing there, 
anyway, what dist do you have?  How are the fresh air hoses?  make sure all 
those connections are good,  with no leaks, nothing stuck in the fan, etc...
.......................
 &gt; 1. since i have a bigger oil cooler should i pour in
 &gt; more oil? and if so how much more?
 &gt;==============
no, didn't make any dif when I put at type IV cooler on mine
..........................
 &gt; 2.if i have to put in more oil should i just put in a
 &gt; deep sump?
 &gt;===========
I though those were for when you drive fast round corners or crazy angles 
like in dune buggies.  
..........
 &gt; 3.since its a 59. type 2 and it originaly had a 40 horse
 &gt; the vents on the side arent big enough?
 &gt;
 &gt; 4. if the vents arent big enough should i put in air
 &gt; scoops?
 &gt;============
the vents are fine, the scoops ar butt ugly.
..............................
 &gt; oh and it was a about 90-95 degrees f. outside but i
 &gt; wasnt able to go more than 3-5 miles.
 &gt;
 &gt; thanks,
 &gt; nick aragon
 &gt;------------------
thats just not right.  go pull that rag out of the fan, or fix that leaky 
fresh air hose connection.
