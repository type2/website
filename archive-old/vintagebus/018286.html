Haven't paid a bit of attn to the thread but judging
from the title all I can say is: &quot;Let me know when the
parts are available from what's left of it.&quot; ;-)

Actually some of my best High school memories
('69-'73) were riding in friend Greg's near perfect
Mango and gullgrey (Pearl?) std splittie with all of
the seats and treats, small rear window and the sand
dollar tail lights. &lt;sigh&gt; The thing was a jewel but
was &quot;just an old Volkwagen&quot; back then. Greg lost his
bus in College days when someone narked on him and AZ
DPS decided that they'd keep the bus as evidence. We
didn't see old Greg for a while after that... He's
probably running for Councilman in District 3 on the
extreme conservative ticket somewhere. =)
Tell the boy to be safe and not to get caught holding.
