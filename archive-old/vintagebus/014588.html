Subject: OCTO
Mime-Version: 1.0

After driving to Cali from TX for two days w/the wife and kids (in the 
american minivan w /AC thankfully), then spending two long days under 
the wrath of disneyland...I all but had to drag my family out of their 
comfy hotel beds to make it to OCTO this morning when the gates opened. 
Even though we were all beat, we hung in there 'til noon when i got to 
meet all the list members who showed. That was the highlight of the show 
for me. Tons of cool busses, and all the parts you'd ever want IF you 
had the $$$ ($700 og safari's...frames only). All I can say is you guys 
here in Cali don't know how good you've got it. All these VW's and parts 
dealers....soooo spoiled. Anyway, other than being tired and a little 
overwhelmed, I really enjoyed seeing it all. We're getting rested for 
the Classic tommorrow and then headed back home to west TX.
