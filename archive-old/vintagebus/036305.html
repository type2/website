Message-ID: &lt;7j9vsd$8frk_at_eGroups_dot_com&gt;

unfortunately we don't all call our busses trucks as we don't all call our ute's pick up's and they are still bull bars over here (australia) although we all drive around with large plow's on the front to move those pesky wombats out of our way!!!!!!!!!!!!. Anyway I've had my dig. For all of those who are interested I have put a couple of pictures on my web sit of the single cab that has no rear air vents. it's at 

http://www.geocities_dot_com/MotorCity/Flats/2351/60sbus.html

so come be amazed and see the freak of nature asingle cab with no visible vents

hope this helps
