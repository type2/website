Well I got ahold of Dave Palmer and we sent emails back and forth due to him 
being in the uk.  He was very polite and did not give the usual &quot;it's your 
fault&quot; run around.  I explained the situation to him and he said that he will 
send out a new set asap right to my door!  That's service.  Its nice to know 
that sometimes quality and service can go hand in hand.  Unlike some of my 
local FLAPS =(

Got more work done on the 57 today. Mostly just searching and marking whre 
the worst damage is at.  Everything seems really solid to me and I think that 
things will go pretty smooth with her.  Does anyone have any of the interior 
trim that fits on the middle divider center panel that wraps around?  I also 
need coat hooks and rear ashtrays and an armrest and a rear bumper and deluxe 
pressed bumper trim and.....
