I sell 6 different brands and 2 styles of mirrors, the round ones I sell are
1. Hellas NOS/OEM commercial mirrors, these have plastic backs (gray) and a
universal clamp that will work on about any round arm. 2. Flat Four
stainless round mirrors with stainless clamp. 3. Round aluminum style with
VW logo and part number on the back (these are made in Taiwan and I think
are of pretty good quality compared to the price you have to pay for Flat
Fours stainless that have a funky distorted mirror in them. Then on to the
elephant ear style of mirror, 1. WCM these seem to be the best but they have
black arms, I was told by WCM that these are made for/by them, 2. Roscoe
elephant ear mirrors, these have the strange clamp down system on the end of
the arm and are regularly found on buses that don't have the VWoA stamp on
the back, these have been made in New York by Roscoe since the bus came to
the U.S.A. or there about, 3. The cheap elephant ear mirrors, these are made
in Taiwan/China and are of fair to good quality, but will get you by for a
decent price, about half as much as the rest available, I am out of stock on
these, which means I have sold a lot of them, but I do explain to the
customer the difference in all the mirrors and let them make the choice, the
key is in the know.
