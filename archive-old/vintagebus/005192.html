Howdy all...

Thought I'd tell you about the little trip I had today....I zoomed up to
Lake County, CA to meet a dude and get some parts.  I had a horrible time
getting there (my Z is ailing), but it sure was interesting once I arrived
at Tom Coddington's place.  I was looking for a cargo door, mirrors, sliding
window latches, and whatever other goodies I might come across.

Tom's place is quite nicely organized, and has many hulks and possibilities.
I did find a door, which I paid $60 for, and although it has rust in the
usual places, it is pretty straight otherwise.  Tom and I had way too much
fun trying to free those bolts!

I ended up with the door, a pair of sliding window latches (with springs,
even!), a gas cap, and a couple panes of side window glass for $100.  I
think I should give him some more for the latches....how much are they
worth?  They are in &quot;decent&quot; shape...the chrome is pitted and bubbling a
bit, but I've seen worse...where do I find the rubber seals for them?

So anyway, Tom sez that it would be cool if I published his name, number,
and email....he does have quite a stash!  He's about 20 minutes out of
Ukiah, and is very helpful.  Tom Coddington/Volksonian Institute/(707)

I tried, for the benefit of the list, to take careful stock of what he's got
in there, but the best I think I can relate is that there is a wide range of
various Volkswagens, and a huge assortment of parts.

Kinda sad, though...seeing all those forlorn cars!

Later, Gene
