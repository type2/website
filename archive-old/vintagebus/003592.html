Subject: Re: [VB] Front bearing packing theory...

Read many times that packing the cavity too full will overheat the bearings.
Some cars call for it, not buses. I always pack the bearings and wipe a
layer about an eighth thick in the cavity. I figure that the slight excess
of grease will fill any lack through centrifugal force. If there is enough
room in the bearing that a cup of grease in the cavity is needed I'll be
pulling the drums to replace the greasy brake shoes and blown wheel seals
anyway. Never burnt a bearing, never worn one out. From my singlecab with a
top speed of 53 to the Westfailure that can make the trip from the OCTO show
to PHX in four and a half hours, it works for me.YMMV.

&gt; NO!  More grease IS NOT better. You only need enough to pack the bearings.
