thats right tom,  the estimate from rimco to make it usable is  377.00   not
counting shipping.   and thats 50.00   round trip.      so remember as Thom
and others have said BUYER BEWARE.    and  also a note to remember  EBAY
will  not help you  evan on missleading or misslisted item's.   john

&gt; Lots of rhetoric...but as I recall, the case WAS junk, wasn't it?  And you
&gt; wouldn't return the buyer's money, correct?
