&gt;finished building and installing the new one. I think it's going to &gt;work,
&gt;1776 big valved single port, duel Kadrons, mated to a 3.88/77 4th big &gt;nut
trans, 
&gt;out there, don't even think of putting it there till at least 40mph,

Hmmm,
that's interesting I was going to do similar things and
mate to a 3.88/82 small nut for my 'driver' config.  I have two requirements
- a *comfortable* top speed of 60 mph (top legal speed on most highways)AND
being able to hold 40 mph in 4th (legal street speed).  I don't want to be
caught cog swapping between 3rd and 4th all the time in the streets. Would
like an 'effective' 4th from 35mph to 60 mph.

As a point of interest, some investigation reveals 
that the 1973 L bug (curved screen superbeetle) here in Oz came
with twin side cover tranny WITH a 3.88 R&amp;P stock (with 82 4th).  My small
nut reduction boxes should bolt straight in.  Was
a twin side cover tranny with 3.88 ever available in the US?
Might save those looking for the lower R&amp;P a lot of grief
if they were! (i.e. no hunt for 3.88 R&amp;P, splined 4th, or 8
bolt retained diff)
