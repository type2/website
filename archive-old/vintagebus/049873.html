&gt;&gt; I bought a stock replacement muffler for my rebuild 1600DP (used to have
&gt;&gt; an extractor exaust) about half a  year ago. It is made by Kradon,
&gt;&gt;Brazil P/N 211 251 051EB.
&gt;&gt; Now that I finally get around to finishing this motor I find that the
&gt;&gt;ends that
&gt;&gt; are supposed to slide on to the heaterboxes are *barely* long enough to
&gt;&gt;meet the
&gt;&gt; pipe coming out of the heaterboxes, barely. They are about 1 inch long
&gt;&gt;and it seems that
&gt;&gt; they are should to be longer then that
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;..some mufflers have shorter pipes where they go on to the heater boxes.
&gt;Sounds like you have one of these, and you unfortunately need to get one
&gt;with the longer pipes.  Not sure why this happens


There are some heater box repair pipes which are meant to be driven into
the exaust outlet of the heater box after the old pipe rots away.  I don't
see why you couldn't use the repair pipes to extend the heater box pipes to
reach your muffler.  The pipes are about 1.5 to 2 inches long, but could
easily be cut down if you don't need that much length.  The downside is
that they do of course have a smaller inside diameter than the original
pipe, so flow is reduced.

The best route is to buy the correct German muffler, and all of the proper
pipes and brackets.  Those were hard to find 15 years ago, the last time I
shopped for an exhaust...

BTW, I happen to have a NOS GENUINE VW 40 horse stale air bus muffler in my
attic.  I could part w/ it for the right price.
