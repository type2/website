&gt; So tommarrow I'm gonna get the fuse box mounted back up. How exactly DOES 
&gt; the fuse box mount up? Does it just pop in or is there supposed to be some 
&gt; kind of holder to keep it in place?

Hi Rex,
There is supposed to be a steel clip that locks the right side of the fuse 
box to the frame.

&gt; Also, I'm using a generic 2 prong flasher right now. I don't have my speedo 
&gt; turn light hooked up. What flasher do I need to hook that up properly? Can I 
&gt; rig a standard 3 prong flasher to work with it? 

Two prong will work you just need to hook two of the three wires to one 
terminal and the other wire to the other terminal.  A 3 relay prong should work 
with one wire per terminal, but sometimes they have to be wired as a two prong.
