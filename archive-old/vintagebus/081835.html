Hi Ronnie, 
 
You don't run gauges, so how do you know your rpms and engine  temps?    
 
Ya, temporarily install a tach to find out your rpms Jason... easy to  do.  
There are so many different gearing it could have in the tranny  in an old 
bus...
 
I don't think many people don't know what rpm's they run.... how could you  
if you never had a tachometer on it?  Very few people can tell rpm's by  ear... 
hey that might be a fun guessing game.  
 
 even though you get more air at higher rpm's, the engine makes  
progressively more heat, as it takes more work to push the bus faster, I think  related to 
the square of the speed, so as you go up in rpm's from idle, the  engine runs 
cooler for a while, and once the rpm's pass a certain point, the  extra heat 
is more than the extra cooling from the fan, so the engine actually  runs 
hotter.    To find the best cooling point on your bus gauges  would be helpful.
 
If you are running big crank pulleys, or small gen pulleys things cool  
differently than with stock pulleys.  It may well affect the coolest rpm,  I'm not 
sure, cause I didn't scope that out..  I found 2600-2800  rpm's  made the 
coolest engine temp (with stock pulleys), on a few  different setups, one was in a 
lowered bus with real high gears and 2000 cc  upright (1600 case) engine with 
an external oil cooler.
 
the widest fan... I think they meant that a doghouse cooling system is  best, 
and there are evidently a few (3?) widths of doghouse fans, I think 33,  34, 
and 35 mm.  the widest one blows more air, so cools best.
 
Making more air cooling is probably better for the engine in terms of  
cooling the heads (where the heat comes from), than adding an oil  cooler.   But if 
you live in a cool climate it could make it not warm  up.   I pulled the small 
gen pulley and put a stock one on as it made  the engine in my 65 run too 
cool here in winter. ( I don't live in  AZ.)

In the type2_dot_com archieves there is a formula for finding your gear ratios in 
 a trans by counting tire revolutions.
How do you know your speed, a speedo  can be off and tire size can affect 
this also. You didn't mention tire  size.
I drive ALL my buses at 3500 to 3900 rpm with the average at 3800,  hot, cold 
outside temps, I don't change,makes no 
difference to me. I find  that in 100+ heat MY engines are happier at 3600 to 
3700 with them having the  tendency to 
start heating up when running at 3000 rpm (to slow of fan  speed). TOO much 
load on the engine with a 3.88 with the 
82 4th gear at  3000 rpm, specially if using a 215X15 tire. In impromto 
testings (feeling the  air out of the defroster 
vents) I have found that between 3300 to 4000 is  when you feel the most air, 
above 4000 you can feel the air out of 
the  vents slowing down.
Everyone has there own feelings and  experiences on this and this is debatted 
as much as tires and which oil and/or  
cooler to use.
Of all the bus people I know most seem to  run in the 3500 to 4000 rpm range 
(not with stock old 1600's though), 
have  been doing it for years and their engines are still fine. I think that 
at the  next BBB I will put on the entry 
form &quot;What rpm's do you run and what size  engine&quot; This should work out well 
with over 200 buses showing up with 
over  3/4 of them driving 300 plus miles to get here.

&gt;Chris,
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for  your input. When you say &quot;widest fan&quot; what are you referring
&gt;to? I'm a  vw mechanical novice (though between us, my wife and I have
&gt;owned an  even dozen).
