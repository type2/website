Subject: Chrome plating wheels/wheel cap needed
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Okay...so I now have a set of 
Eagle Alloy Fuchs style wheels for my bus. What is
nessacery to get these puppies chrome plated? I had my
mom call some plating places around town here in AZ,
but they all said they can't do alluminum wheels
without special and expensive tools or something like
that. I've seen these types of wheels chromed before,
so whats the secret? I also am in search of ONE flat
empi/wolfscrest wheel cap. I have 3 perfect ones and
don't really want to buy a set of 4 more. Thanks!
