Dear Folks and Esteemed Admins,

can you print my buses' name... &quot;&amp;$_at_#*%!&quot;&quot;


I'm going to shoot for those purple balloons, though and try to have a bus
load of them at the Auburn Hills Show. If I can just get my hands on some
Helium in Troy....

Chris and Gus the &quot; I like balloons&quot; Bus
