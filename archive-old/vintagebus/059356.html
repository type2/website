&gt; I noticed my 266H does fit opn my drag link, as the chassis interferes with 
&gt; the nut at the end, just locks against body. Any other tool besides a 
&gt; pickle fork (evil!) to get the front one off, with out pulling pitman!  I 
&gt; tried the rear first, just to spin the rod, but she won't let me do that, 
&gt; either.

Hi Al,
We do have tool 266H, but often we just loosen the locking nut and hit the 
side of the spindle/pitman arm to momentarly distort the taper fit hole in 
the arm which causes the tie/drag end to pop loose.

&gt; I have also noticed my tailights don't go completely out and BLINK, just a 
&gt; weak dimming brightening, fronts are fine. Could this be the still 6v 9 
&gt; prong box, screaming to be replaced by the 12v one I have? Or is this a 
&gt; bulb/wiring issue?

Sounds like you do not have grounding wires run to each of the rear 
taillights going directly to the battery ground strap mounting point on the 
body!  VW finaly figured this was a must in 1970ish when they made it a 
factory item on each and every VW bus.
