 sorry to bother you guys so much, I ordered most of what i think i'll need  
today i don't think i'll have to make gaskets, i think i ordered them - but 
if i did have to make them what would i make them out of?
  tia     jdd believe it or not but i'm learning tons &gt;&gt;
Hi Jdd,
Glad we can help.  We have used plain old white computer paper, and even 
lined note book paper.  Has taken three to five layers for each side.  For 
the RGB halfs you need to make gaskets out of very thin paper like phone book 
material.  We like to use the full one page attorney (Ambulance chashers) 
adds in them.  It is a good idea to pound out any dimpling in the steel 
around the stud holes where the axle tubes bolt to the tranny center section 
and to lightly file the RGB halfs flat.  Also drilling, tapping and 
installing much longer than stock bolts in all of the RGB holes to mount them 
to the swing plates is a very smart move.  Otherwise expect to strip probably 
one if not two of the stock length bolts putting back in the tranny!
