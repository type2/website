Subject: Omaha VW Club Show - NQ will be there.
Date: Mon, 10 Jul 2000 19:55:36 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I've plugged this show a lot but I wanted to let you bus owners (all VW
models) know that no matter whether you have a show stopper or an old beater
bus, I'd really like to encourage your to enter your bus in the show this
Saturday July 15th in Omaha, Nebraska.  The reason is that Rob Laffon and I
would like to get as many old buses lined up so we can all hang out
together.  Those of you driving a long distance can check in with Rob for
accomodations if your group is small. Those of you with Westies can park on
the street!

I'll be there so you can meet NQ in the flesh and overalls too!  I'll be
supplying free pop to listees and buddies so you can beat the heat.

I'm going to enter my bus just so I can park with the rest of the bus guys.
Again, I would like to have you enter even if you bus is a beater (mine is).
I think entry is $20 to $30 but it goes towards the club and you get some
freebie stuff with it.  Count me in!!!

I know that Rob will be there with his 72 Westy and Glen Hadley with his 78
Westy.  I'll be there with my 67 delux and Terry Wolfe with his 65 Westy.
Shelby and his 75 ASI Riviera will be there as well as some KCMOKan members
and their buses.  Out of all these I've mentioned, I'm pretty sure that
Terry's is the only bus that is &quot;magazine/show&quot; quality.

I'd like to get a bunch of us bus guys together and then after the show
we'll have the cruise!   Hope to see you there cuz that's where I'll be!!!
