  Dione and Kenny are bus people; although they are not on the list.  They
are friends of mine and live about a mile from me.  Any kind of virus sent
through them was an accident I assure you.  They communicate with many bus
people so there is no telling how you ended up in their address book!?
Funny how we are all tied together through someone isn't it?  I'll talk to
them tommorrow.  Take care!

&gt; Sorry for the possible non-bus content....
&gt;
&gt; I got an email from Dionne &amp; Kenny (dionej_at_fullnet_dot_net), subject: Niel
&gt; Finch, email concerning some holiday get-together, and a file attachment
&gt; called CFGWIZ32.EXE.
&gt;
&gt; First, did anyone else get this?  I don't know these people, and the
&gt; receipt area is &quot;undisclosed&quot;  I just don't know how I got it.
&gt;
&gt; Second, do any of you know them?  If somehow they got
&gt; vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com or wetwesties_at_yahoogroups_dot_com on their address book,
&gt; it would come to me too.
&gt;
&gt; Finally, What is that attachment?  Anyone know?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
