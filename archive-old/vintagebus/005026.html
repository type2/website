Calling all engine nuts (and builders, too...)

So there I am reading my Gene Berg stuff, and there it is again!  A lengthy
paragraph explaining why they don't use or recommend a line bored case, and
the problems that afflict about 80% of them....early warpage, low oil
pressure, overheating, etc....

I have an engine that I bought with a '67.  This was the first bus I bought
last year.  Came with a Long Enterprises tranny and RGB's....and the kid I
bought it all from had built and installed a 1600 single-port with all new
(or rebuilt) parts.  Starting with a line bored case.  How should I think
about this?

The only excuse I have for paying what I did for that bus is it's new engine
and tranny!

Any thoughts?  I guess I will be rushing out to full-flow filter the case,
and mebbe get a big oil pump....

Gene
