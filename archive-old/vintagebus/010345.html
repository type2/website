use 00 steel wool with a chrome polish, if you  have some rust pits showing
you can rub the shiny
side of aluminum foil on them and the aluminum will fill the pit, follow
with automotive  wax. Waxing any of your chrome parts will keep them from
rusting

&gt; I don't know if this was the proper way to do this, but I used a fine
&gt; steel wool. Chrome is a very hard metal, and the steel wool doesn't
&gt; really seem to hurt it.
&gt;
&gt; I've also used it to remove rust-thru on hubcaps and such, but it is
&gt; important to treat the surface immediately afterwards with some sort of
&gt; wax or acrylic to keep the rust from coming back. Rust-thru is usually
&gt; more a problem with aftermarket stuff. The chrome just isn't as good on
&gt; aftermarket stuff as it is on the original stuff...
&gt;
&gt; I've also used steel wool on glass and rubber with good results.
