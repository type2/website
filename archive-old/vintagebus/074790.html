Subject: *Familienfest.....

Just wanted to say &quot;Thank You&quot; for a terrific show here in Socal put on by
the fine folks at Strictly Vintage 2's. This was at an untested site, and it
turned out to be very well run, and hosted by a great bunch of real VW
Ladies and Gentlemen. We had a really fun day under brilliant California
skies, with a huge turnout of some beautiful cars. The Staff is to be
commended for a well run show. The parking was done well, with plenty of
room, and no questions about how or where to park. The food was excellent,
and plentiful. There were several goodies to be found at the swap area's,
met a lot of fellow VW people, and saw lot's of really nice vehicles. The
raffle was done well, with lot's of laughter and good times.

And the best part, I'll bet next years show will be even better!

Good job, SV-2's!
