&gt; Here is my next question based on my new discovery.  I have heard these 
&gt; voltage drops could go bad.  Would it create MORE resistance, and less 
&gt; volts?  I don't have a volt meter to measure the feed, otherwise I would 
&gt; check...thanks...Oh, does a store like radio shack have these? - K 

Hi Kevin,
Those type of resistors when they go bad just stop passing voltage.  A 
volt/ohm meter can be bought for less than $20.00 from any Rat Shack or 
Hardware store.  BTW are you staying up here in the PNW?  If so hope to see 
you at one of the VW events!
