&lt;&lt; A friend of mine in Colorado has a set of CE
 safaris...first set the frames were so deformed he
 could not fit them into the window openings.  CE sent
 out a 'better' set of frames.  He says they are about
 the same quality as everyone else's repop.  Junky.
 
 I have seen or owned about every repop set made CE and
 Izzys have the right outer contour going, but are
 still of the crappy single chanel manufacture that all
 the repops have. Origibal are double walled steel with
 a fitted male female connectors.  This adds rigidity
 and strength which protects glass cracking ect...plus
 the fit is always superb.  And out of nearly 10 sets
 of originals I have never seen a broken original VW
 latch...NEVER!
 
 Yes, I know they are very very hard to come by but
 they do exist and with some patience and 'serious'
 looking you will get a set.  Just don't frown at the
 price tag the originals bring...they are worth it. At
 $574 for a set of junky repops the prices originals go
 for seems more then fair or sometimes even low!
 
 Too bad someone can't step up to the plate and make a
 good consistent repop.
  &gt;&gt;
funny about that,    I took the safaris out of my bus after my first summer 
driving it because I live in Oly, WA, (It's the Water) and it took quite a 
while to sell the complete set (latches, one eyed duck, bits that weld onto 
the bus, wingnuts etc, frames good, w/ repop wiper disconnects, one good 
original glass, one w/rock chips)   People didn't want to pay.   They would 
rather spend $400 on a set of new crappy repop safaris, ready to pop in, than 
on a 30 something year old set that would need restoring.    And I have heard 
about different repop safaris, the new version- its just like original etc 
etc etc several times.  Then I hear they are kinda crappy.  But what do you 
expect, really?   I sold mine to recoup most of the cost of buying my westy, 
I had to pay more cause the seller says- look safari windows, but I didn't 
want them (the windows) I was into the rest of teh bus, and this is the wrong 
climate - they had been siliconed shut since the bus came to WA in the 
eighties from Pasadena - I think  ?:)
