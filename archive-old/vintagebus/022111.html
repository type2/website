&gt;Was wondering if there was a Type2 Calender out there anywhere. I know it's
&gt;a stretch.

NEATO, the Split Screen Van Club, and the Bulli Kartei have teamed up again 
to produce the 1999 Variations split window bus calendar.

It is a GREAT calendar for split window bus fans.  NEATO members will see 
ordering information in Old Bus Review #62, which should be in your mailbox 
now.  The calendar is $18 for NEATO members, I believe.  Prices are usually 
higher for non-members.

If you are not a NEATO member, but willing to have your arm twisted into 
joining, you can contact me at this address, or Tom Brouillette at 
neato_at_rt66_dot_com.
