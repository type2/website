Subject: Aussie bus oddity

   I just about have the cargo van road worthy. The original gas tank was
rusted out in the bottom so I decided to replace it with a 15 gallon tank
out of a 72 Bay.  Now for the interesting part. I have installed 15 gallon
tanks in all my bus and found that I would have to build braces for them,
well, in the OZ bus it has a bay window fuel tank tray! When I went to
install the tank it went right in with a kick and sets perfect in the tray.
   Another interesting fact is that there is heavy chaulking at all the
seams and you can tell they were assembled a lot sloppier then a German
build bus. 
   Ready to roll again in a few hours, see a bunch of you this weekend at VW
Drag Days
