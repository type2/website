Has anyone mention the use of one of those &quot;Hammer&quot; devices?  You know, the ones
you hit with a sledge hammer.  They fit around the nut and are only about 6&quot;
long.  I have one for each nut size and they work everytime, even on busses that
havent been ran since the early 70's.  I got one after I broke every Craftsman
cheater I owned (now sears owns).  My 2 cents worth....

&gt; Hi NFA,
&gt; First try a longer cheater bar.  We recently had to use a 8' one on a axle
&gt; nut.  If that does not work then do not use heat to loosen it or cut it off.
&gt; This will change the temper of the steel and waste or worse make it dangerous
&gt; to use this axle later!  Instead use a hammer and chisel to cut one side of
&gt; the nut.  You do not have to even cut it all the way.  Just the chiseling
&gt; will spread the nut and loosen it on the axle.  This same use on stuck exaust
&gt; nuts loosens them so you do not have to break off the head studs.   Eric&amp;Barb
