Subject: driving the 65 again 
Message-ID: &lt;0.3b0db80c.252ebf5e_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

after taking the 65 westy off the road after vinatge meet ( end of july) I 
was without a daily driver bus, and it was a sad thing.  2 1/2 months.   The 
61 had had the transaxle taken out and the axles/rgboxes are still in pieces 
all over the garage.   I was driving the bug, though I did drive the barndoor 
a few times, particularly when I got two flat tires in one week in the bug.  
:(

anyway, I finished assembling the longblock for the replacement motor at some 
point for the 65.  This was the motor (AE case) that came to me with the bus, 
which was DP when I got it and decided to die at me, as all DPs do.    It got 
new rod bearings and rebuildt SP heads, the ps and cs were like new, and the 
bottom end seemed just fine.   For some reason it just took a long time to 
get around tuit.  Think that had to do with deciding to do the type4 cooler 
dealie and getting those bits.  so last weekend I added the tin and 
alternator and whatnot, including the nifty preheat pickup and  the type4 
doghouse cooler with modified tin, put the motor in the bus, added a muffler, 
and fired it up.  sounded nice.   

Monday  night I was about to get into bed, changed my mind and put on jeans 
and a flannel shirt over my pjs, headed out to the garage, and hooked up the 
heat, added the apron and bumper, and installed the actual thermostat itself 
and lower tin.

Tuesday I actually drove the bus, nice.   But the bumper hits the tailpipe at 
startup, so I need to adjust that.   Leaks around the windsheild washers 
spigots, gotta deal with that.  came up the steep hill from downtown today, 
(rather than the less steep way)  and it went up the west bay hill just fine. 
 probably 25% grade.  When you go down it you get that roller coaster feeling 
when you hit the flat.  this motoir has a differnt sound that the 61's motor 
I was using, funny about that.

Didn't switch the oil temp sensor over from the previous motor, so don't know 
what temp it runs, but it is 6 miles to work, it doesn't have time to get too 
hot.  But the heat comes out nice within a mile  :0    Yes the PNW fall is 
here, it is rainy and temperate, and getting the heat out soon is oh so nice, 
and we don't need no stinkin carb icing!!!!     I used a pair of nice dry 
heater boxes I picked up in E washington or Idaho, and the heat smelled a 
little funny the first day, but is fine now.  They had been sitting a 
LOOOOONG time.  I think the heat is better than before, certainly the heater 
boxes are nicer, especially as the previous motor  (from my 61) had the small 
diameter heater boxes, and when I had this motor in before the heater boxes 
had leaks in the ouer shell.   these have the collar at the forward end.  

When I change the oil I will put that temp sensor in (oil pressure relief 
plug type)  and will know more.

the brakes stick when I use the parking brake!!!   Right rear.   hopefully 
that will go away soon.
