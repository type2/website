Hey Dave,

I had a cheap orange MVP jack (the $20 swag you get at autozone) that gave 
me about 20 hours of service and then gave me the same symptoms.  I went and 
got some &quot;hydrolic oil&quot; for jacks and tryed to put it in the cap thing that 
says &quot;do not adjust&quot; and I couldn't get it to except any it appeared to be 
full in all positions so I retired it.  Anxious to see if there is another 
method of refilling.

Good Luck, I got a craftmen 2.5 ton w/ a 3 lug attachment tool w/ one that 
is bus friendly and 2 wheel stops and an awesome nylon tote bag for $30 at 
sears last week.

It doesn't go all the way up, and I'm sure it needs fluid
&gt;and bleeding...
&gt;
&gt;Anyone out there in VintageBus Listland ever fix one of these? Can you
&gt;use brake fluid? How do you bleed it?
&gt;
