Hi everyone,


It's wierd to hear of another Westy with the same problem. My 66 Westy also
has M-code 430 which shows the dual circuit master cylinder, but not
underneath the bus. When I finally got around to checking it out after buying
the bus it also has the single circuit cylinder with no signs of tampering.
I guess it's just another strange thing VW did.
