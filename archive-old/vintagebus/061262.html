Ever had a flashlight going dim?
Leave it off for a minute, and it gets bright again. 
Check your generator brushes, and if they look good,
get out your voltmeter, and test your charging system.
Should be instructions in the idiot book, or in the
archives here...
Just had the same problem...It happened exactly like
yours for a while, then when it got real bad, I got
stranded on the side of the road in rural virginia in
the middle of the night!
I think there's a period of time when the generator is
only kinda charging the battery...but not real
well...so you can get it started sometimes, but other
times there's not enough voltage to turn the starter
motor. The dim flashlight phenomenon.
