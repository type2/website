Subject: What's the knob for??

A curious question:  Went back to the Bus I got the small round taillights out
of a couple of years ago.  Noticed I had missed some black dash knobs.  Down
on the floor on either side of the heater knob there was two , I believe, pull
knobs.  The knobs where the same type used on the dash for the lights and
wipers.  What were these for?  The Bus had the round glass Taillights and
Bullet turn Signals.
