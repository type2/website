&gt; Early or late 59?
&gt; I have a set of corners cut from a 58 from the
&gt; beltline down.
&gt; Is the bus a high taillight 59 or a low taillight
&gt; 59?

&gt; &lt;&lt; Hey guys---
&gt; My 1959 Panel is almost ready for paint and I was
&gt; wondering how much paint 
&gt; will I need for it for the outside and the cab?
&gt; cargo area? The outside and 
&gt; cab will be Sealing Wax Red and the cargo area will
&gt; be grey? I really don't 
&gt; want to run out and have to go for a new mix (extra
&gt; paint is fine)! 
&gt; 
&gt; Also--- Ive got to cut the holes for the taillights
&gt; as right now they are 
&gt; solid because of corner repairs --would anyone with
&gt; a 58-61 bus w/ original 
&gt; taillights be willing to trace the holes on paper
&gt; from the beltline down and 
&gt; acurately down the line of the hatch/ engine
&gt; compartment area? I'd be more 
&gt; than willing to pay for shipping of the paper and
&gt; cost of materials? Do you 
&gt; guys know to measurement of the holes also?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks alot--Pete &gt;&gt;
