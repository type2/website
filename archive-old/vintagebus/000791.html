&lt;&lt; 1. Does SO42 come with ac/dc converter?  If yes, where is it?&gt;&gt;
Hi Michael,
No, but you can get a good one from Trip-lite for about $50.00, lesser brands 
out there often burn out electronics in computers, TVs, and VCRs in about two 
years of use.

&lt;&lt; 2. Is there any original metal roof rack around?  I've seen some in sales 
lits and I   
     wonder where are they from.&gt;&gt;
Sure, Germany, USA, and several modern day roof rack makers today.

&lt;&lt;3. Does anybody know the source of SO42's cabinet handles?&gt;&gt;
Only off of junk SO42 interiors!

&lt;&lt;4. Can anybody tell me how to adjust idle speed of 30 pict 3?  Thank you. &gt;&gt;
First always have you jets checked for both for size, and relation to size of 
engine, aircleaner, and muffler.  Never trust the stamped jet sizes, even the 
new ones can be easily 2.5-5 off.  The 30 PICT-3 apparently is fundamently 
the same as the Solex 34 PICT-3 though some of the jets are on the right 
instead of the left, and visa versa.  So you can check out the adjusting 
instructions in Bentley's manual for 1968-1978, or check the type2 library 
for the 34PICT-3 instructions there that we posted in the fuel catagory.
