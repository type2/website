&gt; Hello List!
&gt;  
&gt;  A buddy of mine swears he has found an early LHD panel with a sliding door
&gt;  on the drivers side. I'm no expert, but I've never heard of this combo. Can
&gt;  you guys shed some light? Thanks!

ya- they made them - but they are really rare, especially in the USA.  I have 
seen a LHD LHside door splitty- that was wierd.  you could get the same 
concept for a bay I am sure.   I am sure that Herr Hausmann would have 
preferred on of those- the 63 DD panel I had that used to be a Hausmann's 
Meats delivery van had no wear on the right side cargo doors (or passenger 
front door) but noticable wear on the drivers door, left side double doors, 
and the rear hatch.
