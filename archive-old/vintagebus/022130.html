Peach State Transporters, the Georgia chapter of NEATO, will be holding 
our Summer Campout June 18-20 at Tugaloo State Park near Lavonia, Georgia.
As we are in midst of the height of the camping season, campsite 
reservations at this point are an official &quot;good idea&quot; (I don't want to 
repeat last years Spring Campout fiasco where we had to change campgrounds 
midstream due to a &quot;fishing rodeo&quot; at our 1st choice).

I am going to be out of town until the 17th, so Beth Wallace and Chris 
Sanor will be handling the details on this campout.  Beth has already 
reserved 10 campsites in her name, so PLEASE call Beth at (404) 627-3838 
FIRST to see if she has a spot for you BEFORE you call Tugaloo State Park 
for reservations.

There will be a VW show Saturday June 19 at the Atlanta Raceway in Commerce 
Georgia which is about 30 minutes from the campground if anyone wants to 
attend that.

For more info on this park, including the directions to get there, here is 
the GA DNR page for it:

I hope to see you there!
