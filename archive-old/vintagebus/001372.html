I've got my prototype 3/4CDX plywood box I made for shipping VW engine cases
available.  This will work for a T1 thru T3 case that has been completely
destudded.  I made a mistake the first time so I had to add an extension and
it ended up being slightly cobbled but it will still safely transport a VW
engine case for machine work and so forth.  I'm cleaning out the garage
because I've got so much stuff in there I can't hardly work so it's yours
for the price of shipping first come first serve.  I can send a photo of it
upon request.
