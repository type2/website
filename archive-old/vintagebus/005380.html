&gt;I don't understand what's so opressive about a law that keeps people from
&gt;turning their front yard into a junkyard.

I understand what you are saying here but let me explain.  The way most of
these laws are written and in my case around here, is that it applies to
mopeds, riding mowers, and anything that is motor powered yet they don't
enforce it to those vehicles.  I don't want to run a junkyard but since I
don't have a shop, I'm not even allowed to work on a car in my driveway.
The way the current law reads, I could buy a NEW car and then the city would
deem it junk if I didn't tag it.  If you run out of gas or have a flat tire,
your vehicle is junk.  To top it all off the police are saying that Stock
cars (the ones with crappy paint jobs, dents galore, etc.) are exempt yet
the lawbooks don't reflect this.  They are just now getting around to making
it a law but the fact is the police are making up the laws before they are
in the books.  That's a dangerous situation because it leads to tyranny.

&gt;If you choose to live in a neighborhood (it is YOUR choice, afterall) where
&gt;junked cars on the street and in your yard are frowned upon, then have the
&gt;*common courtesy* not to have junk in your yard or on on the street.  If
&gt;you want to have 50 busses in various states of disrepair, then simply MAKE
&gt;A CHOICE to live in a place where that's OK.  It's not rocket science.

They enacted these laws after I moved here.  I only lived 2 blocks away and
never had a problem.  I moved 2 blocks to where I am now which is well
within the same neighborhood.  I did everything as I did before and have
been continuously targeted by the police.  Now they are sweeping the town
FORCING people to surrender their cars (even if it sits in the driveway and
runs) just because it isn't tagged.  Some of the cars that people are having
to remove or hide behind fences, etc. are halfway decent ones.  I don't want
permission to run a junkyard, I want permission to take an old car and make
it look new again in my driveway without leaving parts lay around, making a
mess, and without the police telling me what I can and can't do regarding a
hobby.  Restoring a car doesn't automatically mean leaving piles of junk
outside.  I keep mine in the little garage I have.

&gt;It's incumbent upon you to live up to the standards of the neighborhood you
&gt;choose to live in.  Now, before I get publically defiled for being a

Well then that means the WHOLE town of Beatrice, NE.  Omaha, a town of
several hundred thousand people north of me (might even be up to a million
by now) doesn't have this kind of enforcement.  They only react to phone
calls (as it used to be here) but even in neighborhoods nicer than mine up
there, guys have their dubs sitting in the open in the backyard.  The police
are too busy chasing down murderers and gang members in bigger cities to
worry themselves with petty crap such as a &quot;junk&quot; vehicle.

&gt;communist, let me just say that I DO love a good project, but I choose to
&gt;keep it in my shop, not in my yard.  I would hope my neighbors would do the
&gt;same.

It ain't in my yard, it's in my driveway.  I do have a couple of bugs parked
in the backyard and they are both good looking and tagged runners yet I get
notified all the time about them.  The city can't even follow the guidelines
put down in the lawbooks.  I resent being targeted when the stock car racer
people get off scott-free.

This will be my last post about this to the list because I do believe it's
getting way off topic.  Thom's been gracious enough to allow me to post the
first time but I needed to clarify my statements in light of Tom's post.
Thanks for the post Tom - I believe in freedom of speech so I'm glad you
spoke up.  I'm not flaming - just clarifying.  Later all!
