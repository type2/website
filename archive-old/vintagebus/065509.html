&gt;   I have even
&gt; heard of people zapping a MIG bead on the screw to keep it in.

That's exactly what I've done with my YOM black on yellow CA plates.  I
used extra long screws and just zapped the last end on it.  If I ever
need to take it off I just cut the screw.  Of course a thief could do
the same thing, but anything to slow them down I say.
