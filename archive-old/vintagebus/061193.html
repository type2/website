Subject: Re: [VB] semaphore wiring

The wiring comes in over the top, thru the pillar and support tube.

To open it, try a bent screwdriver across the top of the semaphore to hit 
the little catch just above the coil.

&gt; I am trying to get my semaphores hooked up but can't find out  where the 
&gt; wiring runs to and from. Like where it comes out at etc..  I was able to get 
&gt; one open and will be able to remove it, the other seems stuck and I don't 
&gt; want to be to forceful.   Is it natural to have to use force?  Heck I want 
&gt; them to work when I am done as well.  The vehicle in question is a 1959 
&gt; panel...Any help out there......
