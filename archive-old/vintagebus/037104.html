Does anybody know if there is a difference between beetle and bus hitches made
by Westfalia? I see an older couple driving around in there 70's bug that is
equipped with said hitch, and I was wondering if it is worth the trouble of
even bothering them for it?
 
As for lug nuts, the other night I was putting my wheel on and noticed
something. 4 of the 5 lugs were different slightly, each was hollowed out. One
was really hollow, next was a little less hollow, and the same and so on, til
the last one was solid. Is this the way that VW balanced the wheels? I have
heard that they are different year lug nuts. Just wanting to know in case
someone bets me!
