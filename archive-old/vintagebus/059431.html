Subject: Re: [VB] Fuel Gauge Q

my 61 when I run to reserve I have to reach to the right of the heater 
control to pull out the reserve knob.  passengers  have been surprised when I 
suddenly grab towards their left foot!!!!!   No choke control- that was for 
36hp buses.

gas guages were options before 62. - standard equipment on ambulances.  They 
read 'full' and &quot;empty&quot; or the equivalent is german, or spanish or whatever.  
you probably have the M code for it on your M code tag.   I have seen only a 
few pre 62s with original gas guage installation, pretty rare.

&lt;&lt; Also, my bus is a 61...vin # 778627.  It has a fuel gauge.  I see no
 evidence of it being cut in, the hole appears factory, no warping or paint
 chips around the hole, the wire for the sender appears original, and with
 the amount of old dust/grime on the tank...I would assume it is original to
 the bus too and it has the cutout for the sender (and a sender of course)
 and no fuel reserve cable hole.  Just a gas heater control, regular heat
 control, and a choke cable (I would assume)...on the right (electric choke
 carb now)
 Is this just a one off? or?  Its an SO-34 westy...could it have something to
 do with being a westy?  I'm not sure what # they started the gauges at, but
 i thought it was 62.  Mine is May 16 1961.  The fuel gauge says &quot;zoll&quot; or
 something for full..I forget exactly what it says, but its not like the
 &quot;normal&quot; gauge.
 Just curious...
 
 Thanks
