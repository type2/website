Subject: Re:  [VB] 66 Bus - What Should I Check Before Trip?
To: SusanSMS_at_aol_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Forgot to ask in my previous message. I'll be driving this 66 bus I'm buying 
next Friday in VT about 125 miles to its temporary home in another part of 
VT. Don't want to make the drive to NJ all at once. The 125 miles is typical 
VT stuff--up and down hills.

I took the bus for a short ride before I bought it, but I wondered what I 
should check before making the longer drive next Friday. I know oil, but what 
else? Fuel hoses? Any help mucho appreciated.

depends on a couple things-  how much time you have and how anal you want to 
be and  what your skills are.  Also is this a daily driver or been sitting?   
I would rather work on a bus chez moi than out in the boonies somewhere, but 
of course there may be some stuff that needs to get done before a trip

have you had an ACVW before ?  DO you have an Idiot book.  Go buy one if you 
dont- other available cheep in second hand store as it has been in print for 
30 years and is written for the non mechanic owner of  a VW  and is great.  I 
still hve my first copy of it which is now in two pieces in spite of having 
been ducttaped together a couple times and some pages pretty grimey.  It has 
margns full of notes I have written, great book. Think they are about $30 new.

When was this bus tuned up?   I would check the oil and adjust the valves.  
Adjust and bleed the brakes (if the fluid is dirty flush all the old stuff 
out by pumping the fluid out till the reservoir is almost empty, wipe the 
black goo out with a clean rag, pour it full with new clean fluid, and pump 
till clean fluid comes out.   Top off reservoir and do each wheel.

how are the axle boots.  There is one at each side of the tranmission where 
the axles go in.  They should have no rips or cracks.  If they do, replace.   
Might as well change the tranny oil too, if you dont know if it has been done 
in the last 20K miles.   Drain oil out of center.   Put on the new boots.  
Clean drain plug magnets. Install drain plugs in center.  Take on rear wheel 
off,  drain it.  replace plug.   Fill it till bubbles happen from the axle 
tube.   Repeat on other side.   Fill centr last.  The whole system is 
connected, so changing it one piece at a time is like draining half your 
engine oil and topping it up.   Rumour has it on good authority that GL-5 
will mar your synchros, and for proper operation you should only use GL-4 
trans oil.  Driving a tranny low on oil I know from experience  reduces its 
useful life.   you need a 17mm allen head for the plugs.

Check the fan belt tension and have a spare with you and tools to change it 
if needed.  Are the fresh air hoses conected?  is the fuel filter dirty?   
are the gas lines cracked and ancient?

there are other things- like was the steering ok?  or scary bad?    I try to 
plan for the worst, but have no idea what shape this bus is in mechanically.  
 It may be perfectly fine to go without you doing anything.    or it may not
