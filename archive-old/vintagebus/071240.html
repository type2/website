Subject: Re: [VB] post it for sale here first!!

I think it's a good thing to post things for sale here... as long as
you're not running your biz here on the list or yer posting twice a
day..., an occasional post for a kewl part is a good thing, even if you
are a hippy ;-)

Hell, if you posted up that you had some og gas tank divider felts, I'd
be more than happy... since I still need a few more strips and I can
button the double cab up.

I remember a (long) while back a big discussion about selling stuff here
too. I guess it's not a big deal anymore since I have seen more of it
latey and no flame wars because of it.  Now mention hippies on the other
hand.... ;)
