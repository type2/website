We use a product called Castroil &quot;Super Clean&quot; on original rubber mats
to clean away years of neglect. You should be able to find it at your
local auto parts store. Used with a bristle brush, this product really
cleans away most anything. You may want to wear rubber gloves as it will
take off a layer or two of your skin. After using the cleaner and hosing
the mat off completely with water, we apply a &quot;NO Touch&quot; tire cleaner
and let it soak in for a while. Wipe with a clean cloth and the mat
should look as good as new. If the mat doesn't look good after all that
attention, Wolfsburg West carries really nice reproductions of the front
and rear cargo floor mats.
