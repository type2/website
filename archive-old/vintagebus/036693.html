*Hi list,

*I have some tricky squeaks towards the front of my '60 Dcab. I have
*completely lubed all zerk fitted points on the beam with the wheels in the
*air and the noises remain. They are intermitent and I don't seem to be able
*to get the squeaks to happen when the vehicle is stationary. I have tried to
*cause the noises by bouncing up and down in the seat without success(I weigh
*120kg so the bus was certainly well bounced).

*Can anyone suggest stuff to look at?   

*TIA --
Check the shock absorber bolts. I had a mysterious squeak and found out that
 the mounting bolts had come loose. Only heard it when I was moving.
