Subject: Trip to Jerome......

Well, didn't make this year;(
Last year, Harry Houck and I went in my 77 Westy. Had 3 blowouts in the right
rear tire. I carry 2 spares but lost the 3rd one just west of Needles on the way
home.
This year did not start out on a good note.....  As I was leaving work at noon
Friday, the clutch cable clevis pin sheared off. Replaced that. Worked fine.
Harry and I left Fresno around 2:30. Took 58 towards Needles...... Around
Mojave, the engine started faintly missing. Almost to Barstow it was missing
more than it was running and would not go over 50. Pulled off into Barstow at
the 1st exit and the engine died at about 6:30 pm. Had spark and fuel pump
running but no power to the injecters. Bart stopped by but there was not much he
could do. So we had it towed to a Motel 6 near a wrecking yard. No luck this
morning at the wrecking finding a ECU, so we rented a car and drove to Hesperia.
There is a yard there, Small Car Connection, that has about 600 VW's! Bought a
used ECU and plugged it in. Bus started and ran great. So I moved the position
of the ECU [I did not unbolt the old one] and the engine died......would not
restart again. I believe the EFI harness has a problem.
So that took the wind out of the sails for going to Jerome. Rented a big Ryder
truck and tow dolly and am now back in Fresno. We had planned on driving the
raffle bus back to Fresno! Next year.......
