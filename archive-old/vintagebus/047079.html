 I can see the lights in front of me in my rearview mirror, reflecting off the
 back window of the cab.   It is sort of misleading.   Probably can be
 considered dangerous.
 
  What do other people w/SCs do about that?
  &gt;&gt;
We just turn the interior mirror so it looks out the passenger slider window
and use the exterior mirrors to see behind us.  With the mirror set in this
way, when you carry a load that blocks the rear window you are used to the
position of the mirror and it removes alot of the blind spot on your right
side.  this also works well for panel vans.     Eric &amp; Barb
