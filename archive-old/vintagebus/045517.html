&lt;&lt; I have a 1600 dp that came out of a 1971 beetle(prolly 20 years ago) It 
has the large hole in the rear tin for preheat. I am using the stock bus air 
cleaner that has a small hole. I have not figured out connect the two.  Any 
ideas?  &gt;&gt;
Hi Chris,
That is easy.  We use the later 1600 tin we for pre-1964 buses use two tin 
can lids sandwiched, nut and screwed through the centers of them.  So you 
either need to find the two piece set of 1500cc tin just forward and rear of 
the pulley or with your 1600 tin just cut a small diameter grommet heat riser 
hole through the two tin can lids.  Then use at least three sets of 
screw/nuts to sandwich them in there!   Eric&amp;Barb
