I like fridge handle better than ice pick. Who has these springs?  Gabe the key guy sold me some that were too small, he said to use two per handle, but the tangs on them are too short. 
These can't be too hard to find or spec to an existing part. If there isn't a good supply somewhere, I'll get a pile of 'em and some roll pins and be the fridge handle czar of the world, T1 and T2! 
Saw an AP report today about the Seattle Toe Truck, a modified bus. It's a landmark/eyesore up there, must be removed for some reason. Not much bus left of it, has a big foot on top. Tom Robbins is from that area, right?
