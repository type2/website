Subject: Re: [VB] switched to dual carbs, need details.

&gt; Eric,
&gt;
&gt; Just what gas mileage do you get? What is the engine size in your westy?
&gt;
&gt; In theory, changing the carbs should not reduce the engine efficiency, but
&gt; improve it. Its all got to be in the set up!!
&gt;
&gt; Your westy must be fuel injected. How does one check the air/fuel mixture
on
&gt; a carb system? Is an oxygen sensor up the tail pipe any use?
&gt;
&gt; Chris

The engine in my Westy is the stock 2.0 with hydraulic lifters. I'm getting
about 25mpg out of it right now with a mix of city and highway driving. It
weighs 4100lbs with just me in it (no gear or water tank filled) according
to the state inspection scales.

To check the mixture of a carb engine is the same as an FI engine. Stick an
O2 sensor in the exhaust and see what she runs at. Not trying to &quot;pimp&quot; our
products, but we do offer a rental wideband kit that has a tailpipe adapter
for the O2 sensor so you don't have to worry about welding a bung into your
exhaust:

Get a group of locals to all go in on it to bring the individual cost down.
Spend about a half hour jetting each engine to get them spot-on. Just make
sure you jet for WOT (Wide Open Throttle) from idle all the way up. Under a
light cruise, the engine leans out (which is normal), but some people make
the mistake of trying to aim for 12.5:1 under a cruise condition which makes
them run richer than hell. Cruising 50mph down the road with my bus the
meter reads 15 to 16 to one, sometimes higher depending on the condition.
WOT is your worst case scenario though, that's what you jet for.

A wideband is the only way I jet anymore. No more guessing and you're done
after just a few jet changes.
