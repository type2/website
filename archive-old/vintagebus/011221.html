 I was wondering what you all have seen original beltline moulding trim go 
 for to do a complete bus?  I won't ask how much ya all think it is worth 
 because I'll be told &quot;whatever someone (hippie, resto buff, or lawyer)  will 
 pay for it.&quot;  Anyway its complete w/ rocker panels missing weatherstipping 
 inserts and the tabby things that go between strips.  Needs buffing but no 
 dents.  Any help would be appreciated!
  &gt;&gt;

well, the earlier (55- 63) tends to be worth a bit more than the later.   I 
believe I have sold a 64-67 set for 100 or 125 w/o rocker panel pieces.  I 
don't believe anyone expects it to come with nice molding inserts, you have 
to take that off to undo the screws anyway and it tends to destroy the old 
moldings.  Not a perfect set, probaly have a few little mushes, like where 
the doors open and tend to do the trim bump, buit nothing major.
