Subject: Paint Shop and Body Pricing?

Over on the ghia list there is a topic on Body and Paint.  I havent been on
this list long enough to realize im probably beating a deadhorse right?
Anyway, some of us arent so lucky to have that garage or buddy with with a
garage to do our own paint or body work.  So heres my questions?

1. What seems to be the average cost for having a bus sprayed 2 tone?
Different methods and costs. (one shot, clearcoat jobs, interior)
2.  How about standard fix its on the body like
	Replacing a rocker
	Dogleg
	reat quarter around the tail light
	rust under the windshield
	rain gutters
	floor pans

I realize these very alot depending on the shop, thankfully my 64 just needs
a paint job and the rear quarter around the tailight replaced.  But i'm a
little curious about the others anyway.  If anyone wants to submit other
repair cost please do along with the area your in.  I'd like to compile a
list of all the individual cost ranges and maybe build a little site with
the answers.  Might make a nice guide for thought on whether to make that
bus purchase for some.
