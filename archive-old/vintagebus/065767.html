&gt;I was welding 16/18 gage square tubing for wrought iron fences with a

&gt;and all in all I still made pretty good welds.

I've been working on my new house and have been taking a break on VW's. 
I've put up a metal panel fence myself and had to use my wire feed welder 
to do the work. I went at it real hot and heavy and it seems to be pretty 
solid. Got lots of practice on thicker stuff now and am much more 
comfertable with welding. I'm looking forward to getting back at the thin 
sheet metal and see how it goes. Just being a little more &quot;in control&quot; 
helps tons.

Also have erected the framework for my garage/shop. Still have some details 
to do before I can &quot;skin&quot; it with the metal panels. It'll match my fence 
and I'll have a nice setup here in town and will be able to get back to the 
VW's. Hopefully will be there not too long after the new year.
