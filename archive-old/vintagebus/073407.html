billy, it's not exactly clear in your post. Are you saying you can
manually change gears w/ the nosecone attached with no problems. You
should be able to do the twist/pull/push thing and get all gears and 1
reverse. is this correct? or are you saying you can get all the
individual sliders to move fwd/rear
