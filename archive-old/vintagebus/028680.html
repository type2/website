I have to agree with Jim!  I had the mother of all stuck drums and nothing I did
would help.  Even the mega strong US made puller + heat + pounding produced
nothing but frustration.  Someone on the list (maybe even Jim) suggested driving
it slightly loose.  Took about 50 miles and when I loosened the nut to try it
again , it basically fell of in my hands.  The leaking axle seal helped out too.
