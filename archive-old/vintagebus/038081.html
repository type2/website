&gt;  Anyway, he says this transmission is 67 or so and my bus is a 60 with the 
&gt; original transmission - what do I have to be concerned about with swapping 
&gt; them.  I guess I would have to use my redux boxes hey?  I have 15&quot; rims but 
&gt; the 67 would take 14&quot; rims - right?  I would like to just slap the new one 
in 
&gt; redux boxes and all but ... not at the expense of getting new rims and 
tires. 
&gt;  Is it possible to just pull my motor and pull my transmission and leave my 
&gt; reduction boxes on my bus? My guess is yes but .... I've only had it out as 
a 
&gt; whole unit.  The ol' fella that I bought it from assures me that the 
&gt; transmission, reduction box bearings, starter etc.. are all good - but he 
won'
&gt; t guarantee the solenoid.  He would guarantee the rest though but he wants 
&gt; more money if it comes with a guarantee.  I also found a guy who will 
rebuild 
&gt; my old transmission. 
&gt;  
I put a big nut (46mm-) RGBox tranny in my 61 when I got the bus- the PO said 
the little nut tranny that was in the bus was a howler.  It also already had 
a later front end on it.  Putting the later RGBoxes in it  means it has the 
later (1 ton) brakes.  ANd will reduce your engine rpms at the same speed (or 
allow more speed at same rpms.  I would use the big nut and 15&quot; rims, unless 
you want it really low geared.    my 61 has a 4.37 r/p, .82 (bus) 4th, and 
the big nut 1.26 RGears, with 15&quot; rims and a 1600SP it cruises up hills and 
happy on freeway at 60 all day.
