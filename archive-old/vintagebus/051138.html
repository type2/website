Call it the doubting thomas in me but I would side with u I would love to =
be proven wrong but if making the money is so simple I would bet he would =
have done it. Call it being altruism challenged.

If making the money was that easy, why doesn't *he* do it?

Whatever happened to the guy with the rusty sunroof standard from

If these cars are anything like the ones in that mess, you wouldn't get $6
much less $6000!
