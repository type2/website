Subject: Drag Buses
To: VintageBus_at_type2_dot_com

Since it's Friday and since I am only a 'casual' collector of VW toys, I 
would like to ask about the VW drag buses.  I have seen and heard a lot of 
talk about the Hot Wheels white over blue and flamed drag bus.  I finally 
found one (actually 3) at the local T_at_rget.  Right next to it was another 
that I have never seen in anyone's collection or even heard any talk of.  It 
is the same bus but molded in bright yellow with black and red scallops.  The 
packaging is also a bit different with an updated Hot Wheels logo.

Am I just too casual a collector, or is this bus something new to the scene?

TIA
