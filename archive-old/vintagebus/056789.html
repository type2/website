&gt; Speaking of flip seats, did that one at Red Barn sell??  The guy was asking 
&gt; 5500.  The roof had been worked and it needed rockers and front window 
&gt; channel repair.  Mostly complete though.  I'm no expert on the flips so I'm 
&gt; sure I missed something.

Hi Volks,
Did anyone get this fellows number or know him?  We have some volks up here 
in the Seattle area who are looking for one of these SO-34 or 35 Westies.   
Thanks,  Eric&amp;Barb
