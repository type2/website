Subject: NOS deluxe grab handle
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hey everyone.

There's an NOS deluxe dash grab handle on ebay. It's
the beige-grey one but it has chrome ends. Was these
the stock issue ends on deluxes with the plastic grab
handle?

I haven't seen ones with the chrome ends. Maybe I
haven't seen enough deluxes. But the repro shops only
have beige-grey ends. Has anyone seen a repro with the
chrome ends?

BTW: The bidding is at $102.50. I think someone is
building another $45,000 deluxe.

Jason
67 deluxe soon to be ex-&quot;DARTHVW&quot; (no grab handle)
