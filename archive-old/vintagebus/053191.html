&gt; Awesome mods.  I especially like the grate to prevent siphoning:)  You
&gt; didn't take any pics by any chance that show the bend in the filler?

Hi Thomas,
Try:
http://hometown.aol_dot_com/veewee111/index.html
and please tell us if this website of ours works.  We are still trying to 
figure out webpage design.  The pictures show:
1.  The cut and angled inlet/filler tube to the tank.
2.  Our 1641cc SP CW engine that has pushed us around for over 50,000 miles 
so far with no major problems.
3.  The inlet/filler tube top to the tank is now about 2&quot; taller than stock 
and due to this the gas does not as often seep out of the gas cap when the 
tank is full when parked.
