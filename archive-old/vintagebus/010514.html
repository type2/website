hose it down with liquid wrench, and then choke up on it and work it back
and forth , hopefully you ill hear a screach and then it will start to come
out, if it breaks off you can tap it out with a hammer,until it ges flush ,
then use a 16 penny nail and a hammer to push it the rest of the way
through, jb/alabama

Subject: [VB] driver's side mirror removal


&gt; Hi volks,
&gt; The driver's side arm for my mirror is broken and I am trying to replace
the
&gt; arm and all with an elephant ear.  How do you remove the arm?  I undid the
&gt; nut, took the weird washer with the two pointy things on either side off
and
&gt; then another washer.  Am I missing something because it is not coming
off....
&gt;
&gt; Please help I like to see what is in that lane before I have to look to
change
&gt; lanes.  This is on a 65 21 window deluxe.
&gt;  Also the mirror that came off is VW but it is round.  All the suppliers
that
&gt; I have looked at don't list my mirror as being round.  Is it supposed to
be?
&gt;
