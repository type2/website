&lt;&lt; Can the hockey stick on a bug be used on a bus?  &gt;&gt;

If you have a 53ish or earlier bus with the access plate under the rear seat, 
then yes.  Later buses you have to hand or have professionally regrind a 
drill bit for the proper angle sided hole 180 degree from the bug shifter 
lock bolt hole for the square headed lock bolt to engage properly.  Still you 
end up with a flat spot at the center of this drilled hole and have to drill 
this area with a 1/8&quot; drill bit to clearance for the tip of the bolt.
