Let's say I was digging through a stack of Bus seats at the junkyard and
found a near-perfect, original upholstery early Kombi front bench seat back.
Let's say I purchased it.  Let's say it's covered in dust and dirt from
years of storage.  Let's say I want to bring it back to life.

Let's say someone could recommend a product?

Let's say thanks,
Everett Barnes
