Subject: Re: [VB] No idle, delayed motor racing after throttle

Try using carb cleaner to check for leaks instead of WD40. Make sure it 
has a nice big Flammable warning label. It sounds like a huge vacuum 
leak, probably between the manifold and head. Check the boot on the 
manifold too.

&lt; snip&gt;

&gt; Now, if that wasn't enough:  3/4 exhaust is hot, 1/2 is cold, after
&gt; letting it run up and down for 10 minutes.  The valves and plugs are
&gt; good, the plugs are firing.  Both donor engines were running fine
&gt; previously.  What is going on here?
