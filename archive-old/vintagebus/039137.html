The Top 14 Signs Your Volkswagen Needs Cleaning


14&gt; Your beautiful new Water Beetle is constantly being mistaken
    for the Oscar Meyer Turdmobile.

13&gt; On the way to the fishin' hole, Andy and Opie stop by your
    Baywindow's windshield for bait.

12&gt; Greenpeace won't let you move the Panel for fear of displacing
    some dung beetles that have taken up residence in the reduction boxes.

11&gt; Neighborhood kids offer: &quot;Mow your VW, sir?&quot;

10&gt; The pine tree air freshener in your Kombi is now a protected
    old growth forest.

 9&gt; Satellite photos reveal crop circles on your Highroof.

 8&gt; &quot;Wash Me&quot; appears on your Westy's rear hatch -- chiseled with a
    jackhammer.

 7&gt; Impossible to drive with the kids always clamoring to have a
    look through the bus' periscope.

 6&gt; Your &quot;cell phone antenna&quot; is really a sapling which took root on your
    Squareback's roof rack.

 5&gt; &quot;What do you mean 'needs cleaning??' How else will everyone know
    that my Type 2 is a driver?&quot;

 4&gt; Visits to the farm always result in pigs humping your Beetle's tires.

 3&gt; Kids write &quot;PLOW ME!&quot; on the nose of your Double Cab.

 2&gt; When you honk the horn, prairie dogs pop up from the bed of your
    Single Cab.
