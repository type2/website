&lt;&lt; I want to mount an extern oil cooler, to get my oil temperature down, but 
I live in a place when it can get minus 10 degress celcius, so I also want to 
mount a thermostat to the oil cooler.
 It have been dicussed if it's safe to mount a thermostat (due to the 
circulation of oil). I mean that it is the save. As it is in a watercooled 
engine. Here the thermostat close the cooler for the water until it's hot 
enough, would'nt it be the same in a oil cooler or I'm I to far out ? &gt;&gt;
Hi Lars,
First what have you done to get the temp down already?  Doghouse shroud with 
type 4 cooler?  33, 34, or best yet 35mm inside measurement cooling fan?  2:1 
ratio lower rear pulley not the 1.6 or 1.8 or aftermarket power pulley?  
Going through the engine and getting things like this correct are a much 
better alternative.  Have you been cruising about 2,500-2,800 RPM in really 
warm weather?  External coolers all too often are a cause of oil pressure 
loss and engine failure when the hoses to or from fail!  Yes you would have 
to have some kind of thermostat and if you do go to a exterior cooler 
directly off the oil pump.  Make sure you use a flatened tube type.  Round 
tube coolers are a waste of your energy, time and $ due to allowing a core of 
hot oil pass through the center of the tubes.  Which is why VW coolers are of 
a flat tube or plate type.   Eric&amp;Barb
