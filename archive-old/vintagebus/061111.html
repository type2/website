Subject: RE: [VB] pulley ratio

&gt; I called my &quot;Local Porsche dealer&quot; a couple of months ago with all the
&gt; part numbers etc.  The price was between $150 and $200.  Don't know what
&gt; other Porsche dealers may charge, but I don't think I'll bother calling
&gt; the one in my town anymore.  Bergman never replied.

150-200 no way.


&gt; I think Parts
&gt; Obsolete sounded good from what I remember.  I think Pelican Parts
&gt; referred me there because they didn't deal with 356s.

Ahh but it is the same part on early 912s and pelican does have them
listed.
Obsolete was the cheapest

20.20 for the Hub
11.95 and 8.75 for the pulley halves
