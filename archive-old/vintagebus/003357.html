I think the few extra $$ for 4+ inches of concrete would be money well spent
especially if you have any kind of freezing and thawing going on.  Most of
the expense is in the labor for preparing the ground and the finishing of
the slab.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I wonder if the thickness varies depending on the type of soil your
setting
the concrete on? I know they recommend 48 inches for the wall footings
because this puts the bottom of the wall below the frost line here in Omaha
NE. I  hear there are different recommendations for different areas.  I
think they did recommend 4 inches with out the fiber glass, but they said 3
inches would be the least thickness with the fiberglass and still have
vehicles drive on it. I never asked about driving dump trucks on the
concrete though.

Thanks, Kevin Sullivan
