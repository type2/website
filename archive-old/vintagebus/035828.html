Hi Mark,
Definitely go to using 30WT or if you must then use 20/50WT during the 
summer.  Would not use 10/30WT unless the weather is going to stay well below 
40F.  Preferrably Castrol, Valvolene, Quaker, or maybe Kendall oil.  Pennsoil 
is real bad for the ACVW engine due to the fact that it coats the inside of 
the engine with a waxy coat.  Resulting in smaller oil passages and less 
cooling due to insulating the oil from the inside walls of the oil cooler.
