Well sh*t.  That's kind of a bummer, because they lost out on a rebuild,
and I gave away my axles thinking they were not usable.  It's been an
expensive summer.  Oh well, live and learn.  I guess I'm going to remember
REAL good that all axles from after barndoors to 67 are the same.  Not one
of lifes great lessons, but a good thing to know if you drive old buses.:)
Thanks Clara.
