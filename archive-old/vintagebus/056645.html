 As far as we know the life of the motor is under control.
 Because it has an oiltemp. meter and an oilpressure meter.
 The oiltemp. is always about the Kmph we drive.
 So if we drive 90 Kmph the meter shows 90 degrees C, and if we drive 110
 Kmph it shows 110 degrees C.
 The oilpressure is always 2 bar. We dont know if that is correct. Shouldn't
 it be 3 bar?
  &gt;&gt;

how does bar convert to PSI?   The engine engine that is now in my 61 idles 
about 10-12 psi when fully warmed up.   When warmed up at speed is about 
40psi ?   when cold this morning went up about to 70psi.  You should see your 
pressure drop as the engine warms up.  you should see it rise when you step 
on the gas, and drop when it goes back to idle

at 2500rpms at 176F pressure should be not under 28psi.
