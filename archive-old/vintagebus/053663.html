hi,

for anyone who has seen the movie 'spy game', i was wondering what was =
the make of the ambulance in the opening scene.  there were a few vw's, =
but the ambulance was strange.  i'm thinking it might be one of those =
auto union or dkw's that another listee was writing about.

any clues?

mike
