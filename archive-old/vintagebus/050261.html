Saw this on the VW newsgroup and thought maybe some of you Cali folks

Subject: Stolen 23 window bus!
Date: 22 Jan 2000 03:28:53 GMT


My '62 23 window bus was stolen in San Jose on 1-20-00.  It was two-toned
(White on yellow), stock height, had stock wheels, white overrider front bumper
and no rear bumper.  The passenger side rear corner window was cracked and it
had a brown gas door.  The dash was not cut nor was anything else (wheel wells,
etc.).  It was relatively complete with the exception of a headliner.  Both
front and rear floors were rusty.  It had a new 1776 with a single weber 40, 96
plate oil cooler, spin on filter, rebuilt trans with reduction gears, and an
alternator.  There were no dents in the body and the paint was good.  License
plate # is DSB724 on a black plate and the vin # is 903417.  If anyone has any
information on this bus or sees a suspicious new 23 window around please
contact me at 408-932-3129 or the San Jose Police Department.
