Subject: St. Mary's Food Bank,Phoenix--

Here is some fun for you on Saurday-May 5th--, uj

St. Mary's Food Bank is desperately in need of 30 volunteers to help at the
Aunt Chilada's Cinco de Mayo party on May 5 from 3 p.m. to 9 p.m. The event
will be held at Pointe South Mountain, just west of I-10 off Baseline Rd.
The party location is just south of Aunt Chilada's - south on Pointe
Parkway. Volunteers will meet with John Carylne, the head of security at
the Fountain at 3. Volunteer duties will primarily be directing traffic and
making sure people use the proper crosswalks. Tee shirts and beverages will
be provided. Dinner will be served at 9 p.m. for the volunteers. Any help
you can can give us would be greatly appreciated. Please let me know. Sue
Kriz, 602-352-3640 ext. 1140.

PS- St. Mary's Food Bank is the oldest Food Bank in America--Because it was the 1st!!
