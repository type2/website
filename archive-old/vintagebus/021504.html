Dont know where you are at - but here in California, it really isnt that 
difficult.  We purchased our Squareback with no title.   The Auto Club (AAA) 
helped us with all the paper work.  Its not gonna happen over night though 
(took us about 8 weeks before we got a new fresh title.

Hope this helps - some

Have a great day
