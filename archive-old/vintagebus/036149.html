&lt;&lt; The metal tubes I have to connect the heater boxes to the body won't fit

&quot;60mm to 50mm&quot; heater box-body hoses.  &gt;&gt;
Hi Matt,
Easiest way to do this properly is to cut and weld the forward end/outlet to 
the smaller size.  Otherwise to fit in an adapter piece you will have to ctu 
down the metal flex tube that connects the heat exchanger to the heater tubes 
in the VW body.  Since we have a few 1963 model VWs made after DEC62 (Plus 
several earlier VWs.) which was after the stale air to 50mm fresh air change 
we have split several heater boxes apart.  Then switched the later internal 
finned J-tubes into the early 50mm outlet shetmetal skins!  Resulting in 40HP 
fresh air heater boxes with the better heating/cooling J-tubes inside.
