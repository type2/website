Subject: [VB] Bosch 009, One spring or two?

Hi JT,
One spring.  Take the cap off and see if you can get the shaft of the 
distributor under the rotor to swivel.  No swivel means someone did not put a couple 
of drops of oil under the rotor at every 3,000 mile tune up and now it is 
rusted up!  To fix, pull distributor, mark the gear and shaft on the bottom of the 
distributor so you can put them back together properly, remove the spring 
like retainer around the gear, punch out the pin in the gear, and remove the 
shaft out of the distributor, take futher apart, oil, work loose, clean, and once 
you have the swivel working put it all back together.
