Subject: Re: [VB] front seat area? /sliding door deluxe

   The dormobiles were made on sunroof buses.

  the westy version was, but the martin walter conversions where just done on
a regular kombi, or what ever bus you brought them. i had a 63 martin walter
conversion and it definetly had some body stress from the giant hole in the
roof and no belly pans. wish i would have kept it though.
