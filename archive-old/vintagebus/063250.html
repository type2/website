Hi Ted,
I've always mounted mine right in front of the torsion bar.  A 72 plate
cooler fits right in.  You have to weld a frame.  JP has always done that
part.  I tap the frame for mount screws and the cooler can drop out from
above and the fan can bolt on from beneath.
THis is on earlier busses, I'm assuming the spacing is similar on a 71.
