When I said rotation I should have said front to rear, bias ply tires you
can do the 4 corner rotation  (on a none swing axle vw)but who uses those
anymore. When radial tires were introduced it was recomened NOT to 4 corner
rotate the tires as that would cause seperation of the belts, as radial tire
technology progressed they when to the 4 corner rotaion except on
directional tires (like thom's Porsche), so I'm sure senior hoover was
talking bias plys which would wear and handle strange if 4 corner rotated on
a swing axle vehical.
