Dear List,
I am new to this list, and have a dilemma.
I am acquiring a 1967 Deluxe walk-thru, 13 window, in Cumulus White over
SeaBlue.  It is emply except for a couple of wall panels in a blue/white
combination.  Now I have inquired on a couple of other sites about this
combo, and searched about 25 pages of these archives...._dot_can't find out
if this was an interior for &quot;67 only, or if it was used in previous
years.  I am dealing with a guy who has bluish/white panels from his &quot;66
deluxe, but I want to make sure that they are correct for my bus. I am
in the bus registry, so if anyone can shed some light on this interior,
please let me know.  Also, are my seat stands a silver-beige?  Thanks so
much.
