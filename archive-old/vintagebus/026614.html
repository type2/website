What else are you going to have to give up to get all those RHD BD parts for
your baby.  Lets see no legs, only one arm and one ball gets you Lenny's bus.
Cool RHD busses cost more...no??   Hmmm....you didn't want kids anyway right?
They'd just mess up that awesome interior.  Oh well maybe La Vera is cutting
(pun intended ) you a better deal....he just might leave you one arm and one leg
to stand and drive on ;-)

I'm just jealous as hell though.  I'd give up the other nut and an eye ball for
that bus!
