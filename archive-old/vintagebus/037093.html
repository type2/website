     Our 65 Standard with pop-top was hit in the right rear quarter,
 suffering considerable damage to sheet metal, wheel well and general shape
 in the rear. The estimate on repair from a reputable local shop we trust
 implicitly is in the neighborhood of $4,000. This would return the Tamale to
 the shape it was in before the accident, that is with some miner dings and
 needing a new paint job, interior finishing and general cosmetic repair.
 
     Seeking opinions on repair or not repair. I hate like hell to sacrifice
 another body to the choppers, but then other bodies would live again.
  &gt;&gt;
just wondering- is this a fix someone's insurance will pay for?
