Erin writ:

&gt; So this raises a couple of questions that I would like to ask some of you.
&gt; I know this 1600 is getting a work out pulling the bus with it's freeway
&gt; flier trans and tall 15&quot; tires.  It really makes this bus scoot along but
&gt; I'm well aware that VW knew that to pull a certain load, the engine was
&gt; going to have to turn at a certain RPM throughout it's operating range in
&gt; order to keep the engine cool.  Will my 1776 with Berg sump, full flow
&gt; oiling, 40IDF's, and T4 oil cooler be able to handle this load without
&gt; overheating (anyone out there with real world examples?) or will my
&gt; overheating likely continue due to decreased RPM's at 4th gear speeds?
&gt;


Erin,
  When I ordered my engine from Bernie Bergmann, I told him I was planning
to install a freeway flier. He recommended and supplied (for a nominal fee,
of course) a 'Porsche' generator pulley. This is smaller in diameter than
the stock pulley, resulting higher fan RPMs to compensate for the lower
engine speed. It's a simple thing and might be just what you need.
