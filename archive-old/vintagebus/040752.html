Nick -

1) Use whatever amount of oil your particular engine / cooler set up
takes to hit the full mark on the dipstick. This is about 2.5 quarts
in a stock setup. If you have a bigger cooler, it could be more, but
probably not that much more. Be careful not to overfill. First thing
in the morning, when the oil is cold and thick, it probably isn't
going to the cooler at all. If you have an excess of oil in the sump
you may well be inviting some blown oil seals.

2) I hear both pros and cons about the bigger sump. I know plenty of
engines run just fine without them, so I don't  bother. It certainly
isn't necessary.

3) Engine compartment vents went from innies to outies at some time,
but I don't think they they ever got bigger. Some soup-it-up volks run
some pretty big engines in there without adding jumbo vents, so I
doubt that is the problem.

4) Plastic scoops? Please don't. My vents are surrounded by little
rust prone holes that someday, before I can paint this bus, I am going
to have to fill and grind, fill and grind, fill and grind... Probably
literally ad nauseum. I imagine I'm going to do no small amount of
cursing of the PO and his plastic scoops on that day. But what I
should say is live and let live, so if you want them, go get them.
Just don't ask me if I think they look cool.

Somehow I don't think these things are what you need to address. If
your engine is truly running hot (I don't know Gene Berg dipstick, but
I assume it is telling you your oil is well above 200F)  then find out
what is really going wrong before you cover the problem up with a
bigger cooler or whatever.

Is your timing really where it is supposed to be? Did you check it at
2500+rpms to see if it is advancing properly? That advanced position
is probably more important than the idle position (because you don't
drive at idle). Is the carb giving you enough gas in the mixture? A
lean engine can be a hot engine. How about them valves? I am running a
new engine too, and I am keeping my valves a little loose for now. New
things are happening to the parts in a new engine. There's a lot of
expanding and rapid wearing together going on in your new engine, all
that friction translating to heat.

I don't believe a stock VW engine has a cooling problem when running
properly. Maybe yours isn't running properly? My opinion is that you
should make it work right stock before adding a bunch of stuff to it.
Me, I would rather spend my accessory dollar on a nice hula doll up
front than a screamer engine mod in the back. C'mon, we drive cheap
(economy priced) vans not sports cars. Trust the Herr Dokter Porsche
and his design team, he really did know what he was doing.

Hey, good luck, (+time+money+frustration+patience=good bus+)
Joel

ok heres the scoop....

i have a new mexico 1600dp with a type 4 oil cooler.
when i put oil in 2.5 quarts filled it to the top mark.
i have a gene berg dip stick sensor. i coldent drive
more than 5 miles without the light coming on.

now all my tin is correctly installed all my seals are
in place. my timing is set a 7.5 btc. nothing is in my
fan either, now here are my questions.

1. since i have a bigger oil cooler should i pour in
more oil? and if so how much more?

2.if i have to put in more oil should i just put in a
deep sump?

3.since its a 59. type 2 and it originaly had a 40 horse
the vents on the side arent big enough?

4. if the vents arent big enough should i put in air
scoops?

oh and it was a about 90-95 degrees f. outside but i
wasnt able to go more than 3-5 miles.

thanks,
nick aragon
