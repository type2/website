&gt; No offense, but it's just you.  Just because I'm a professional, living in
&gt; a nice suburban neighborhood certainly doesn't mean I like my VW's less
&gt; than you.

True - should have broadened the definition or used another term besides 'enthusiast'.

You don't have a problem if you can displace the resto to a local shop or a large garage.  Leave your 60 dbl door dismantled in your driveway for a week and see what 'The Smitheringtons' down the street have to say about it. Would you challenge them?  No. Why?  Because you agree with them.

Veedubbing should not be a 'sport of kings', but i guess as time goes by and parts suppliers realize that the 'enthusiast' can and will pay higher and higher prices for harder to find parts it will move towards that.

The rest of us will be staking out the local boneyards and mowing around our partsbusses.

Last post you'll see from me on this.
