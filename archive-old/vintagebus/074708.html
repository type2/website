Subject: Magic Smoke

Puff!  What a crappy week I'm having.  Ok so I get in the bus this morning 
gonna drive it to work and I smell gas.  I discover the filler neck, bay 
window tank conversion had came loose.  So I reach in and get it back on.  
OK everything looks ok.  I hop inside and turn the ignition, fires up, but 
the starter sticks and smoke begins coming out of the dash pod.  So I try it 
again thinking it may have came loose.  Nope more smoke.  I get out and rock 
it back and forth a little, starts up ok this time and the starter releases. 
  More smoke!  What the heck,  I get out leave it in the driveway and come 
to work.  So I haven't had a chance to tear into it, but I am assuming I 
fried some wires in the ignition switch.  Why didn't a fuse pop?  I have all 
the correct ones in.  I still have the 6 volt harness, but everything else 
is 12 volt(cept my wiper moter).  The switch still operates, but it smokes 
when the alternator turns not when the key is on.  My gen light goes out 
too.....  Any way I need to vent a little,  I replied to a job posting on 
another mail group and sent my resume out to the entire group last night, 
ppl already started ribbing me this morning.  Karma, Bah! I don't buy it.  
What did I do.
