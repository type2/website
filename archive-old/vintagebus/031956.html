Subject: Re: [VB] Need choke cable hole location in fan shroud!
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hi John,
40 HP will not have the choke cable hole!  The early 40HP shroud (Stale air) 
will look alot like the 36HP shroud, but have the indent at the top center 
for the 40 HP type 1 air cleaner.  Thank you very much for the offer to check 
it out for us!  We have to get the engine in this late morning so we can test 
the engine and get ready for Sacramento trip starting first thing tomorrow!  
Keep On VWing, Eric&amp;Barb
