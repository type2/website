Subject: Re: [VB] Shifting Issues

You can take the shift stick off the front floor, and clean up in the ball and socket joint and the shift plate, apply fresh grease there, and re-install.  You may have the adjust the plate on the floor after installing.  Then install a good boot over the shift stick to cover to place where the ball/socket is.   You can also grease where the forward shift rod goes through the forward shift bushing under the front floor.
 
Gear oil should be changed every 3 years/30K miles, whichever comes first.  While the gear oil is drained, replace your axle boots if they are cracked or torn.
 
Sigh... I need to do all this stuff.   I did take the shift stick out, and clean it up, which helped, but it still has issues.  My cover boot needs replacing, too... it's all torn,  which lets dirt on the floor get in the joint.  It's pretty cold out there.   Also, my right axle seal is starting to ooze.  sigh. 
 
Check to make sure the forward and rear coupler have the screws snug, and wired, and that the rear coupler is firm, not woggly.

Subject: [VB] Shifting Issues


Clara's post reminded me that my 60 pickup has been very stiff in recent
weeks when I shift it, like it needs lubrication.  I've no trouble
finding a gear, but it's really stiff shifting into all gears.  Is there
a place to lubricate it or is something else going on?

Thanks for any info.
