&gt; As far as I know, it's how VW did it from the factory.  It's how my '61
 single cab was and most anyone else that I've talked to who had any
 experience with Pickups has said the same.  Perhaps this is the work of a
PO, but I have seen the pop-rivets in quite a few pickups.  They basically
 pop-riveted the strips from the underside so there wouldn't be any
 inconsistancy in the uper surfaces of the strips for things to hang up on.
 I'm not sure if this was a change from a previous method or not.
&gt;
The wood strips began to be fastened with rivets on Nov. 21, 1960, chassis #
684 866.

I have seen at least 2 1960 Trucks with screws in the original slats.
