&gt; Ok, did the oil change and got the screen out and proceeded to inspect stuff.
&gt; I had a fair amount of goop on the inside of the plate.  I would say at least
&gt; a 1/4 inch of it.  I poked through it, found some grit and stuff and a BIG
&gt; piece of a washer.  The small stuff did not worry me, but the washer did. This
&gt; is not your typical flat washer.  It is about the size of a dime and the stock
&gt; is square-ish. 

It kinds sounds like a spacer washer that goes under the distributor
drive.
