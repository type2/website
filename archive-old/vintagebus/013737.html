Subject: [VB] re:refinishing rims and hubcap clips
Message-ID: &lt;19991022064739.2838.qmail_at_awcst094_dot_netaddress_dot_usa_dot_net&gt;

First item of business is getting all the hubcaps clips off by either
  smacking them with a chisel from the front side or center puch and drill
  from the back, then pry carefully from the front.

why do the old clips need to be removed from the rims? Will they affect the
sandblasting, or do you only take them off if they are in bad shape?
