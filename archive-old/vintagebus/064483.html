Subject: Reading up on stuff on the 1961 and have a few light questions!

In the Bentley for 50-62 in Section A-14 page 12 last words on the page say
that the glass on the drivers side of a bus is special and called 'Visurit'.
What is that and what makes it special?   Why wouldn't you want that for the
passenger side too?

Also in the same section but A-11 page 1-5 shows body cutting lines.   Are
these the lines that VW used when putting the panels together and the dot dash
dot lines are the panels that are under the dash dash dash lines?  There is no
description with these pages and just kind of stumped me!  If you were to want
to replace the corners would you need to replace them all the way to the roof
line like they show in this drawing?   Also why would a single cab front
profile be different than and regular bus profile.  The picture here show a
small box like thing on the SC undercarriage where it doesn't in the regular
profile?  Just reading tonight on how and where to start?!

Got the 61 23 sunroof in the machine shop to work on for the winter tonight
and one of the guys there has a rotisserie that he is not using.......humm.  I
had just been contemplating more of a clean up and patch and seal body wise as
to keep the original paint but than I might need to use the equipment that I
have available to me now!   The machine shop is a friends shop where he has
his business in 2/3's of the shop and than rents to race guys the other side
of the shop.   Wait till they come in and see my beauty over on there
side!!!!!!  I have been working on roofracks there so they know me and my bus
habit.   Sure is alot cheaper working on classics than working on something to
go and race it and wreak it to go work on it all over again.   Sounds like
golf!!!       More questions to follow I am sure
