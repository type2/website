fire extinquishers are great IF YOU REMEMBER TO USE THEM, back to the fire
drill thread again, When my shop caught on fire 2 months ago today, i was in
such a panic that i ran past the fire extinquishers 4 times looking for a
hose!!!!!!, finally i ran and got the one out of my bus!!!!!! even though
there was one in the hall the fire was in and another 7 or 8 throughout the
shop, the fire drill is important, because in a panic you forget where
things are and then it's to late. I probaly could have saved a lot of the
loss and damage had i practiced for a fire, now i will and i'll add even
more fire put out devices, extinquishers, bucket of soda, fire blanket and
will make sure i have a hose hooked up at each entrance. It wasn't fun and
am still recoping my losses.

Jack Maynard wrote &quot;If you all don't believe this story, ask Ty, he knows
all
about it.
And ask him about his 412 in Ensenada. There is a fire story&quot;

Story confirmed! I think he even still wears that burnt up t-shirt on
occasion.
Jack never throughs anything out. As for the $75 412 I can't remember and
all
the evidence is gone.
