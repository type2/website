Evidentally, I stand corrected. I'm totally surprised
(and disappointed) at your report. Supposing that it
all depends on the person is who is actually doing the
physical labor and management of the moment. My report
is based on experience that is now several years old.
The word at that time was that Mesa Metro was the
place to go if you wanted it done right and were
willing to pay a buck more. Your posted descriptions
sounded like a carbon copy of what I went through.
Would have bet a dollar to a donut that you were
refering to Papago. I have to stand by your personal
recent experiences. Listees be warned to &quot;Wades&quot;
words. Who knew, eh?
Would I get involved in another resto right now?~ hell
no!
