According to the guru, you just install the shims dry.  I thought they would
get ground up or something but he says just spec them dry, put your seal in
and tighten it back up.  Make sure you put a little oil between the seal and
the flywheel though - that area does need to be kept lubed.  If it's tight
then, you know that it's a false reading and that the seal is just giving
you false readings at that point.  So far so good.
