Volks,

In case you don't know (and his is generally the sort of job you only
notice when it goes wrong) this list has been moving with depressing
regularity, and David Raistrick has been busting his hump (I considered
lots of other terms, but most would have hit the profanity filter :-) to
keep us up and running.  I would like to offer my public thanks and
gratitude to David for service to the VW bus community *way* above and
beyond the call of duty!

Also, I would like to thank Denis Jolliffe who, when I requested
donations, offered and donated the box (computer) that David is talking
about :-) Thanks to Denis, we are ISP-independent!  We may, in the future,
suffer temporary outages as the box moves from place to place, but we have
a permanent machine (as soon as David finishes busting his whatever :-) to
get it ready for occupancy :-)

                           H Steven Dolan

Yay.  More to do, but the lists should be kicking.
