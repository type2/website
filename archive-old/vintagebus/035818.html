Hi JP,
The P&amp;Cs, the rings and even the bearing surfaces in there have to wear into 
each other.  The result is alot of heat caused by friction.  Once worn in 
these parts take less HP to move and the rings are worn in to seal thier best 
to the cylinders for peak compression and alot less blowby.   Eric&amp;Barb
