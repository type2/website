Hey All!

Most excellent happenings, I'm very stoked....actually, I'm a bit bummed
that it's over, but there'll be more to come.  Got back from the Brian
Piercy &quot;Shasta Snow Trip&quot; last night......unbelievable great fun time was
had by all!  Even the mishaps were cool, and there was no trouble of the
kind that bums people out. (More on that comment later...) Every bus went
and performed well, and even the rattly, slimy, slushy, washboardy, dusty,
etc. roads couldn't hurt us.  We went from Guerneville, CA., to Mt. Shasta,
CA., in 18 hours, about 470 miles, and many back roads.  Real back roads.
It was killer!  Speeds generally about 20-45 mph.  I was worried about
Bartholomew before the trip, but he performed rather well!  The dipstick was
never really hot, and performance of the engine and tranny were great.  I do
think, still, that there's something up with the front suspension
steering-wise, but I just drive slower...

There were 3 in the caravan....a 64 Kombi with a kickin' stereo, 1641 with
Webers, and a Long Enterprises tranny driven by Aaron, then Babs and Brian
in their groovy '66 Sundial pushed by a 1600 sp, and my uncle Stuart and
myself, with a '60 Doublecab sporting a noisy but strong 1600 dp.

The experiences we all had with each other and our Volkswagens will not soon
be forgotten, not only because they were wonderful and exhilarating
experiences, but because we got a lot on videotape and digital cameras, and
Advantix shots by Babs.  I'm going to be doing two major things.....three
then....editing down the 7-8 hours of video, my 114 digital stills, an
unknown quantity of Babs' advantix and digital shots, and Aaron's shots into
an easy-to-watch 30-45 minute video.  Also, my next post will contain a link
to a site that contains as many details that I can come up with about this
trip, accompanied by photos, sound, and possibly short MPEG clips.  Anyone
interested in the edited version of the video send me a tape with return
postage, or the cost of a tape and postage, and you'll get a copy.....it's
gonna be cool!  But not for a while, yet, as I have lots of material to sift
through, and a job.
