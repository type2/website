I have been thinking about what I need to do concerning the brakes on my '59 
and I've decided to go with discs.  My question is...should I consider doing 
the rears also since I will be swapping out the tranny.  I found a deal on a 
beater '75 and got the front axle and the transmission to do the swap.  I 
called up Kennedy Engineering and they tell me that I can get an adaptor kit 
to hook up.

Any and all help welcome...I appreciate the open-mindedness of the majority 
of the list members with the exception of Mr. Brian Wittling who is a total 
c*cksucking fag and Wade, who is a liar...I never once sent Wade any hate 
mail of any sort but he felt the need to post to the list that I did.  I did 
however send Mr. Wittling a not-so-nice reply to his smart-ass, small-minded 
response to my original post.

Everyone else have a very nice day.

Thanks,

Terry
