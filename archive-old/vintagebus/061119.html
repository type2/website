Subject: re:[VB] Jerome,off road journey 

It's a temptation to wire up a gaggle of KC lights, stuff bull bars/winch on
it, pull the hubcaps and join you. I already have the tires for it. Fuggin AZ
pinstriping would do that trophy b*tch some good. Crap, at this point starting
the engine once in a while would do it some good. =) 
Naw never mind I'd have to buy a few shifter couplers to make it through...
hahaha!

BTW: a heard of Land Rover Dormobiles made a similar journey across Northern AZ
back in 1998.
