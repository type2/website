Hi Michael,
We had not tried this ourself, but contemplated it.  Recently saw some 
friends who had gone with this method with good results.  The stronger the 
magnets the better, or failing strong magnets the more the merrier.  Also if 
you use the thinnest material (Nylon?) possible on the window side of the 
curtains to sew on the magnets they will hang onto the steel of the bus much 
better.
