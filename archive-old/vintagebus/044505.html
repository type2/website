&lt;&lt; should I put anything on the new gasket to promote sealing between the two 
pieces of exhaust? &gt;&gt;
Hi Paul,
First if you are talking about a flat gasket then you really need to check 
the area to make sure it is flat.  In the case of steel areas of these it is 
a matter of bending/filing these flat.  Then make sure not to over tighen and 
rewarp the areas you just straightened.  Where dealing with the sufaces of 
aluminum heads it is just filing that has to be done.  In the areas that have 
the round dounut seals a little high temp silicon sealant does seem to help 
when the exaust tube they seal around are a little smaller than the seals due 
to corrosion.   Eric&amp;Barb
