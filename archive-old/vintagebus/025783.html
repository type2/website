&gt; So this is the same case as with the 4 tip monza style exhaust?

 In my honest/humble opinion, the 4-tip monza is a nightmare.
There is not enough back pressure, and every upright-fanhousing-engined
vehicle I have seen with one ran very rich and poorly. Go stock if you
can, if you are running a stock displacement and stock carbureted
engine. I have tried many combinations, and the stock single-tipped bus
exhaust always seems to give best results on a 40hp thru 1600 &quot;type 1&quot;
engined bus....
