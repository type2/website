Subject: Ride to Jerome from San Jose CA

I am contemplating going to Jerome this year. but my plan  would be to drive 
the 87 A/C vanagon Westy.
I remember driving back through Needles at 104 degrees F and up the long  
hill into California.
I am trying to get Roger Nang to join me and we would have  more spaces if 
people want to come.
The plan is to leave San Jose at around 5PM on Thursday and  drive through 
the night to get to Jerome Friday morning.
We would leave Jerome on Sunday early enough to get back to work on Monday!  
Maybe missing the final raffle.
 
If anyone wants to come please let me know.
I will pay for the gas.
We will have space to take and bring back swap stuff goodies.
Mapquest says it is 750 miles and 12 hours  driving,
