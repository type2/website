Subject: Re: [VB] Need help on my '66 

ya, removed leaf springs from the front end have several effects

1) lowering bus
2) very jolty ride
3) weakening suspension

check the end of the front beam to make sure the leaves are all there.  What 
we are calling leaves are straight flat pieces of metal.   they are narrow at 
one side, then fatter in middle, and narrow at the other end.  9 in tiotal

I did once fix a bus that had broken leaf springs.   It was a  stock 
suspension 74 camper, and the guy wasn't driving odd, and luckily did not 
flip the bus.   He thought his wheel fell off.  I guess there is no moral to 
that.

leaf springs are very hard to drill through or cut with a grinder, but are 
flexible and useful for many household and garage functions.

&lt;&lt; 4.  Have a front suspension that additionally has had spring leaves 
removed 
 to weaken the springs to lower it, or failure of these leaf springs 
 (cracking) due to wear, DPO driving habits, or even removal of front 
 suspension rubber snubbers and their mounts.  DANGER, DANGER,  (Flailing 
arms 
 about) this can easily result in the rest of the leaves failing suddenly 
 while at speed.  Resulting in the front of the bus suddenly resting on its 
 front wheels and even the pavement.  Look Ma no steering!!!  Flip, flip, 
 flop!
