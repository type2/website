Hi Ronnie,

Everett and I need some small feet reproduced for our barndoor front seats.  They are about 2 inches long and pressed out of thick sheet metal.  Do you think your sheet metal guy could make someting this small?  I will try to get photos.  Do you know anyone else that can make small metal parts?  Figure if anyone knows you would.

Thanks,
Richard
