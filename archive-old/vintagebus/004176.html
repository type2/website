Subject: [VB] 58-67 Bus parts book -- finished!  + long time no see update

Ok, so it's been six months...but the scanning is complete.  749 pages all
online for the world to see.  The SO-42 parts list supplied by Dave
Easterwood is also online, oh, three or four months after he &quot;loaned&quot; it to
me.  :-)  I'm afraid that upgrading the motherboard in this machine made the
scanner decide not to work with it.  I eventually installed Win98 on another
partition on my Linux box and did the scanning using that machine...that was
yesterday :-)  Here's the addy:

http://home.cwru_dot_edu/~agw4/docs.htm

For those that have linked directly to the site (you shouldn't ;-)) the docs
are now hosted at members.nbci_dot_com, not members.xoom_dot_com.  Did anybody else
that uses them get an email about the change?  I sure didn't.

And, hello list, it's been a while :-)  The reason being that I've been busy
with school, and also no longer driving buses :-(  I pulled my Kombi off the
road after nearly running beneath a tractor trailer, trying to stop going
downhill.  I decided at that point that in the interests of my own safety I
shouldn't be driving until I could afford to fix up the Westy.  I'm now
driving a...a...Toyota (cough)...a non-air-cooled VW for the first time
since 1995.  I learned to drive and got my license in a VW.  It's made me
want to fix up the Westy, but I've got no dough man :-)  This weekend,
however, I plan to get started in earnest.  I'll be yanking out the
non-functional tranny in the Westy and replacing it with the worn-yet-worthy
unit in the Kombi.  Also the engine.  Probably several electrical
components...who knows, the camper hasn't touched the road since 1979, a
year before I came into the world.

I recall some interest in the fact that my Westy has a full belly pan.  I do
not have the M codes handy, but I did look them up.  It has the one for a
belly pan.  Also has the one for locking ignition, chrome hubcaps, and a gas
heater.  I've still got the locking ignition, and while cleaning out the bus
I actually found the bakelite plastic cap that goes over the electrical
connections -- perfect condition, not even any scratches.  Cool.  Funny
thing is, when I found it I just tossed it out of the bus since I had no
idea what it was...realized what it was...and shouted excitedly at my friend
to grab it.  I think I scared him a bit!

An interesting thing about the documentation page...people from four
different countries have emailed me about the page.  To my surprise, the
most emails came not from the USA, but...from Japan!  This really did
surprise me.  I sent an email to the last guy from there, and he said
something to the effect that these books are extremely difficult to find
over there in any condition.  Thinking about it, it makes sense...and I
think finding them _here_ is hard :-)  None of them mentioned being on the
list, so I'm guessing they found a link on another site somewhere.  Who
knows.  I put stats on who I've received emails from towards the bottom of
the page.

Well that's all for now, I'm sure that I'll be ranting about tranny related
things shortly!

Bye...no, sayonara ;-)
