Hi all -

I was driving around Annapolis this afternoon and saw a beautiful split
window crew cab (white over red) with big yellow fog lights on the front.
My daughter just about went nuts saying &quot;Daddy, your truck is fixed!!!&quot;
Aahhh, the innocence of a 4 year old.  If anyone might know who this would
be, I'd appreciate it.  I figure they might be in town for the Bug Out this
weekend.  Anyway, if you happen to find yourself at the Bug Out on Sunday, I
will be in the swap area, working out of a f_at_rd.  Stop by and say hi!

Paul
