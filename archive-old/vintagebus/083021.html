Subject: Re: Re: [VB] Soundproofing

I found a roll of that stuff one time at Home Depot. Turns out it was the
last roll in the store and they had discontinued it. I bet it is available
at other outlets.

 In my '65 panel, I used an asphalt based product that is used by the
construction industry around new window installation. It has a peel off
sticky back that adheres very well by itself, though when you use a heat
gun, it works better. It is pliable enough to form around the metal
variations. I have found it in most hardware supply/lumber yards and it
comes in different widths. It is also much, much cheaper than the commercial
soundproofing stuff. If anyone is interested, I can supply the product name;
I don't recall it off hand. I covered almost the entire back of the bus, but
haven't done the front doors yet. When you rap on the exterior of the
drivers door and the on the side of the bus where the stuff is applied, the
difference is amazing. My panel is much quieter and will be even more so
after I panel it. Jason
