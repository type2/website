Subject: [VB] Re: Flip seat Westy/ M code help


My '59 SO-23 has the SK indentifier on the M-code, SK 693.  The research I
did at the time led me to believe that SK did in fact stand for Sikkens
paint.  I originally thought that it meant special color, but read something
somewhere that changed my opinion.  My '59 is Mango Green/Sea Gull Grey, and
there doesn't seem to be anything *special* about the colors, or the way in
which it was painted.  Except if you look at it in this June's issue of Hot
VWs.  The color is VERY special, it's faded out, washed out tan!!!
