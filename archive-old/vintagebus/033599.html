Subject: Caulking

   Does anybody out there know when VW started caulking the seams on buses?
   I am still getting piles of sand and dirt out of the rockers, outriggers
and frame rails of my DC. It is amazing how I can blow air in the tiniest
gaps (front splash to frame) and still have stuff poring out of the weep
holes in the rockers and even the openings of the high hinges. After
checking that out I think I have figured out the B pillar rust deal. As you
are driving in the rain it hits against the hinges letting in water. The
weep holes at the base of the B pillars are plugged from years of road
stuff, thus not letting out the water which in turn causes rust. Is that why
VW put the wedges on the high hinge buses, not to protect it from catching
stuff, but to avoid letting water in. Just a thought.
   So once I get as much of this crap cleaned out I will proceed to use 3M
seam sealer on all seams and small openings to avoid the possibility of
letting in any more water or road dirt, leaving all the weep holes open.

Ronnie    5 gallon pail of dirt and sand so far!
