I'll bet it was me that torqued him.  He's still torqued at the pic on my page 
of him and the 17 buses, and my quip about &quot;when was the last time you saw a 
newsletter?&quot;

OTOH, when is somoene going to kick the NEATO folks in the butt to get their
web page going?  I think it's absolutely stoopid to *remove* the page
during renovation.  Leave the old crappy one up until you get the new content
worked out, then bring in the new one.
