ya- it does look like there are the brake light decklid bus reflectors under 
those 59 style round glass taillights-  is that normal for SA buses of that 
year? 

  I once saw a guy who had put the reflectors on his RGT bus, to try to make 
it 'look older'  (as he said) which I think is lame and pathetic, a RGT bus 
is neato (plug) for being what it is, why give it an identity crisis?

I like the white over zebra striped bus in the background-  very cool.
