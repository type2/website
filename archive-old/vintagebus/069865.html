&gt; Ah - little problem didn't do that on the one I have fitted already.  Just
&gt; went back to it and tried lifting it and it did not seem to move - however I
&gt; have refitted the spring plate cover.  Should I pop this back off to check?
&gt; I assume this would restrict movement.

If you don't feel any play from the splines I'd leave it be.

&gt; &gt; Measure twice, cut once.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Er I don't really want to cut anything - oh perhaps you are sneakily trying
&gt; to tell me to change the angle to 0 degrees and cut the wheel arches out so
&gt; I can drag along the floor and look as kewl as hell!!!!!  lol!!

No, just a saying!   Double check everything before buttoning it all up!
