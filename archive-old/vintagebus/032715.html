Subject: Door Hinge Problem

Now that I have removed all rusty parts to my new 65 walk thru
deluxe.(Floors, rockers, frame supports, jack points, doglegs, and most
everything 10&quot; up from bottom of bus) I started to remove cargo doors. 
First hinge(top), bolts came right out after soaking for three weeks with
WD40.  Bottom hinge would not budge.  Got out hand breaker with Phillips
head and pounded away. Both bolts came out without damage to heads but, as
I pulled out the second bolt the plate slid down inside the door frame. 
How do I get the plate out and how do I get it back in place and keep it
there?  The other lower hinge came out but I stuck a piece of welding rod
in one hole so plate would not slide down door frame. 
Any suggestions or solutions would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks in advance
