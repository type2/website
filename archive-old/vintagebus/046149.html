I think you are right, Steve.  SOTO has given too many of it's members the
&quot;brush&quot; in recent years.  I think this may spell the official demise of the
old club.  I'll see you at the OCTO show also!!!

&lt;&lt; Not sure if you'll get much support for that event on this list Andrew.  I
 could be wrong though.  Most people that I run into are going to support the
 NEATO sanctioned O.C.T.O. event that will take place the same day down at the
 Pond in Anaheim CA.   This event is being promoted as the co-event to the VW
 Classic that is put on by Rich Kimball of Periscope Ent.  The O.C.T.O. event
is
 Saturday the 12th and the VW Classic is the 13th.

 This &quot;head to head&quot; scheduling was done for a reason I believe.  Many people
 were fed up with things that happened and didn't happen with the &quot;non-profit&quot;
 SOTO club.  Turn outs to both events will tell if the people have spoken.
