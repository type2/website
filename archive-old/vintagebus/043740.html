&gt;
&gt;On my 6v bus I am trying to hook up a third brake light (no, that is 
&gt;not the stupid part(maybe)).  When I connect the third light wire to
&gt;1 of the original lights, all three brake lights go out. When I 
&gt;disconnect the wire the std two brake lights work fine again.  Does 
&gt;this mean I have a grounding problem on the third light?  Or am I
&gt;just trying to draw too much juice?

First make sure that the wire to the third (new) brake light isn't
grounding out anywhere.  Also, you have a 6v bulb in the new light,
right?  If all that is OK, then your problem may be poor grounding
of the two original brake lights.  Try rigging up a ground wire from
where the battery ground strap bolts to the body, to the tubular
metal part of one of the rear lights (right in back of the two
wire terminals).  Then hook up your 3rd brake light to that same
regular brake light.  If everything is OK now, make permanent ground
wires for both regular lights.

Also, unless you have a Euro-spec Bus with separate amber turn
signals, you can't really have a third &quot;brake&quot; light.  The third
light will just do the same thing as the light you connect it to -
if you hook it to the right light, hit the brakes, and turn right,
the third light will flash instead of lighting up solid.  The most
reliable way to get it to work right would be to run another wire
from the switch on the master cylinder to the back of the Bus.

Good luck!
