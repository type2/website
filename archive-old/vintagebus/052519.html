 So I got the 28 PCI on my bus today.  My bus hadn't been started in about a 
month and it has been quite Ontario cold (as opposed to Manitoba cold) for 
the last few weeks.  I tried to start it twice and no go - I then clamped the 
manual choke in on position and that bad boy started first try - no problem 
at all. I just have to hook up the choke cable, which is already in my bus, 
and I'll be cruisin'.  I'm reluctant to take it for a drive as there is 
already salt on the roads so I may have to wait for till the roads are 
relatively salt free before I start monitoring the jets.   &gt;&gt;
