Subject: RE: Tires...

I picked up a set of 205/70/15 Pirelli Scorpians for my 60 Double Cab
and I have been very happy with them. I got them through the Tire Rack _at_
tirerack_dot_com. We live in a very windy area and they handle the wind very
well. Sidewall stiffness will help the most with the wind. The
205/70/15's are a touch smaller diameter than the factory size but are
way larger diameter than the 165/R15's I took off. I am running stock
15&quot; bus wheels with a stock height Double Cab so I don't want to say for
sure they will work if lowering or different rims are concerned. These
tires are not designed to go on a rim as narrow as the factory wheels so
you need to decide that for yourself.
Good luck,
Craig
