Subject: RE: [VB] WTB - NOS mounts

Damn it, that was the whole point, not to get those
Indian mounts. I bought all three today at the FLAPS,
maybe I will return the imposters. I just want parts
that ease my mind, and work fine.

&gt; even though they say Germany on them they are just

&gt; been using and selling
&gt; German nosecone mounts and OEM Genuine VW de Mexico
&gt; craddle mounts (have had
&gt; good success with these)
