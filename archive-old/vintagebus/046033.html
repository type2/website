I called Ronnie today. Explained the problems, which I have been plagued with 
recently. Was glad he didn't make me feel like an idiot such as many other VW 
retailers. We discussed options for getting this resolved and he suggested 
calling Sam at Rancho and explain it all to him. He said that Sam was a great 
guy and that he might send the stuff out with no charge. I was rather 
skeptical, mostly for the part that most retailers would simply say I 
installed it wrong and that it's my problem. I was shocked to say the least 
about what Sam had to say. Hardly any questions asked. No blame about who's 
fault it is and no games. I explained to him that the tranny had come to me 
with a stripped out nose cone mounting stud and he wanted me to ship the 
entire tranny back to him just so he could fix it. Then he asked me if it was 
my daily driver, I told him it was and he fully understood that I couldn't be 
down for very long. So he told me exactly how to fix it here. 

I explained about the fulcrum plates and the axles and he was quick to write 
everything down. All in all he decided to send me 2 new axles, 2 new side 
gears, 4 new fulcrum plates, 2 new thrust washers, 2 new clips as well as all 
the gaskets I destroyed when I took the thing apart. I wasn't wanting him to 
send me the gaskets as I was completely fine with buying them myself. But he 
wanted to.

In my 6 years now being into VW's I have never dealt with a person of this 
type before. His customer service cannot be matched, except of course by 
Ronnie. These are the guys who have kept me in the hobby by allowing me small 
mistakes to learn by and not taking advantage of it. I just wish that all 
dealers and builders had this type of class.

Now I just need to find someone here locally that can help me set it up. I've 
got beer money but I'm not old enough to buy any yet. J

My sincere thanks go out to both Ronnie and Sam!
