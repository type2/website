he is still in korea, he startted a two year tour right after the classic 
this year,it could have been a freind in his crew cab , hard to say.   paul &gt;&gt;

The other Binz at the Bulli Brigade was bought from a guy in Texas over a 
year ago.  It is in Black Primer.  At one time there were three (or more) 
Binz in FL...mine was also one of them.  They seem to all be migrating to FL. 
 

I would like some info on the one in Korea....
