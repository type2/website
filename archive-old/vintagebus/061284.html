Subject: Re: [VB] jp's good thing (friday)

People actually came up to me at the Bandimere show
asking where I was parked because they wanted to see
my scoops.  And Jon's right... they did go with my
Martha Stewart bedding in the bus.  However, it was
the type 4 cooler that finally helped with my
overheating problem.  That dropped my oil temp 30
degrees, the scoops by themselves seemed to do very
little.

PS Thanks Tom for busting me - I did have to drill
holes to install them, but then this bus does not have
a single undamaged body panel.

&gt; tom bueses sent me a picture of jp's turkis flipseat
&gt; and &quot;his Martha Stewart collaboration vent scoops&quot;
&gt; as seen at the recent colorado campout and show.
