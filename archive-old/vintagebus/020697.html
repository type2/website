Subject: Re: [VB] Holy dirt batbus

&gt; I have been using a hand
&gt; grinder to remover the scale and then brush painting
&gt; with a white primer
&gt; with a high zinc content. Don't know if this is the
&gt; best way to go about
&gt; it, but so far I am content to do it though it is a
&gt; formidable task. 

I used a zinc-rich primer on a top-rack that I built
out of electrical conduit, and it worked OK out here
in the desert, until I loaned it to Jon Furst for a
trip to the east coast to pick up some parts, at which
point, it rusted through the primer and topcoat around
about 1/3 to 1/2 of the welds.  Good idea here in the
desert southwest, but I don't think it would hold up
unless you put a very good topcoat on (I used rattle
cans) soon after the primer application in any high
humidity environment.
