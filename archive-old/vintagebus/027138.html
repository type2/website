&gt; I'm torqued.  Those who know me know it takes a LOT to get me *really*
&gt; torqued.   I bent over and ponied up the $350, plus $150 core (c'mon, how
&gt; much is a core really worth?) for a brazilian locking column box.  I get
&gt; this thing in the mail today, which has some funky &quot;hammerite&quot; finish or
&gt; something - looks like stucco, and the threads for the steering wheel are
&gt; buggered beyond belief!  If you are going to take $350 (plus $150 core)
&gt; the LEAST you can do is run a freakin' die over the threads!
&gt;
&gt; In addition, the item was shipped loose in a big cardboard box packed in
&gt; NEWSPAPER!  What the *hell* are these people thinking????
&gt;

I'll say it again..................go with the originals (Wolfgangs) Same
town. same stuff, BETTER quality, never had a problem with them...........
