Subject: asbestos?

I sort of assumed perhaps blindly that due to the vintage and appearance
of all the krap that came out of the blanket and the construction of
the few bits of blanket that asbestos was used.

I have no lab at my disposal or parts lists. However. I have learned my
lesson...

1) Don't dive into a convo on a partial quote of the original message
2) wear a darned mask regardless.

sorry all..

dust bad...bad dust...
