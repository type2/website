Many 21 and 23 will be sold in the coming weeks for prices which I expect 
will determine the longivity of the currently inflated prices on base cars. 
We will keep you posted on the details including the quality of restoration 
and sale price of the following vehicles,a 66 21, a 67 21, a 60 23 and a 58 
23.
