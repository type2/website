&lt;&lt; I saw a setup like that in the Interstate between Mobile Al and Montgomery 
Al last summer when coming back from Biloxi.  After passing I started to stop 
up the road to get a picture has it passed by.  Looking back, I wish I had 
taken the picture.  The difference though was this one used 2 rear Bay 
Windows to make it.  Hey, maybe this 67 Panel I've decide to scrap would make 
a good tag along.  How would you free up the trine to turn freely?     Dave &gt;&gt;

Hi Dave,
Interesting!  By &quot;trine&quot; we think you mean tranny.  Which we have pondered 
much about already.
  1.  One way would be to just install a full bus tranny and make sure it is 
shifted into nuetral and full of gear oil.  This would allow one to easily 
carry a spare tranny for that around the world trip, and to boot one could 
install a spare complete engine bolted up to it!

  2.  Go to a tranny rebuilder and pick up an empty no good tranny  swing 
axle center section case.  Install the RGB axle tubesand axle boots with only 
the lower axles and bearings in them.  Plug both the shift rod hole in the 
nose cone and the input shaft bore in the rear to allow gear oil   Then the 
brake backing plates, brakes and drums.  Having the brakes would allow the 
use of trailer brakes system and would be life saving if one planned to load 
the trailer and go over mountains with steep/long downgrades.
   If one was to do a type 1 or 3 swing axle tranny in a simular way you 
would have to install a differantial, crown gears, and bearings for the 
differantial to support the inner ends of the longer type 1 axles.  Otherwise 
it would be much as just above.
