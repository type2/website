Hey aaron and wilder and scott,     I will try to bring the wife and
kids.  Never been to the flower gardens but my buddy at work says there
great.  I will just pay the fee at the show.  I live  just  down the
street from downtown La Mesa.  They have a BIG car show every thursday
but have never seen any buses.  Has sv2's ever been to this event?  How
many people are in the club?  See ya.          Jon in san diego
