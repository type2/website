I need some help on determining if my '62 has 65000 or 165000.  What are some
of the things I need to look for to tell whether or not it is original?  No
engine so I couldn't decide from that....Everything else is in actually good
condition..It's set up since '80(derived from the date on license plate
tags).  Anyhelp is greatly appreciated!
