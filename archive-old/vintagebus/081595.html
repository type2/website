Subject: Re: [VB] Crankcase full of gas!!

Are you running a Braz. 30/31??

I had the same problem of running rich and eventually flooding the case.  I 
rebuilt the relatively new carb and cleaned it throughly, but when the bowl 
was filled, gas would drip out the discharge tube(not the accl. pipe) like a 
3 year old with a runny nose.  I never could get it to stop.  I have a 
feeling there is a check ball in some circut(just a guess) that is stuck 
open and letting gas flow out of the bowl.  What ever the problem was I 
switched to an old pict34 and a new fuel pump(just in case) and now no 
problems!

Now I only have to put up with the F'ing flat spot :-(
