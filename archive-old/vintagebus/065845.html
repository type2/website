&gt; yes these can be rusted and a pain to remove.   If you don't hit them 
&gt; exactly so the piecs will grab each other.  I'd take a grinder and cut
along 
&gt; the small piece you are trying to pound out.  You can buy new clamps (and 
&gt; rubber bushings) fairly inexpensively.

Good idea!  Any recommendations for a US supplier that ships abroad if I
cannot find them in the UK?

&gt;&gt; Last question now - I disconnected the link that goes from the steering
box
&gt;&gt;  to the swivel pin at the swivel pin end.   However the link has a lot of
&gt;&gt;  side to side movement - I can push it into and pull out from the
steering
&gt;&gt; box quite a distance - is this normal?
...
&gt; not clear which bit you are talking about.  Steering bar has a pit man arm
on 
&gt; it.  sometimes the shaft that the pitman arm is on can be pulled in/out
(or 
&gt; side to side depending on your frame of reference) No this isn't good, 
&gt; whether it's bad enough to rebuild is your call.  I've seen it often
enough.  
&gt; driven with it.  it only gets more worn.   To the pitman arm it the drag 
&gt; link- whch has ball joint ends at front, and at back attaches to the
assembly 
&gt; at the swing lever.   The swing lever should not have play.  Neither end
of 
&gt; the drag link should have play.

It is the drag link that has play at the steering box end.  I can push the
drag link sideways (ie towards the side of the bus) and pull it back by
about half an inch I think.  There was some play in the steering, about 2
inches which I believed to be normal.
