I sold my last mint bus lunchbox to a lunchbox collector for 700$ with 
thermos.
Book value is 975$ on it!
She was EXTATIC to find one at that price!
Its just us VW people who are cheap! ;-)

&lt;&lt;This is why I love to get eBay links.  It cracks me up to see how much
people pay for these items.  Keep 'em coming.
