I don't think the shocks provide any sore of lateral support
or correction.  The rough ride might bang something up, but
I think that's it.

&gt; I was wondering - if you remove the rear shocks from a Bus, can that knock the rear wheels out of alignment over time and therefore cause uneven wear on the tires?  
&gt; 
&gt; Or... Is the purpose of shocks to provide more than a dampening effect but to also keep the suspension at a consistent position while driving?
