I was under the depression the owner was taking light rail to work an just
parked there.  I guess it could be someone working in that area.  Did you see
enough of it to say if it has the interior in it?  if so I'm going to go take a
peek just for grins.

&gt; &gt;Hi Folks,
&gt; &gt;         I've been seeing this Bus parked on Del Paso Blvd. and Globe
&gt; &gt;Ave. in Sacramento, It has the Hatch and I guess It is derivable since I
&gt; &gt;don't see it parked there all the time.  Anyone on the list own it?
&gt; &gt;Just curious.
&gt;
&gt; I've seen it too.  One night I was driving by and I honked; there was a guy
&gt; working on a car inside the shop, and he looked up, but didn't wave.
