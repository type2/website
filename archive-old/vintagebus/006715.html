 Delivered a bus today to a private person (low key) he had over 10 delux
buses including barndoors,23 and 15 windows, didn't have any 13 or 21
deluxes that i could see, doesn't like them, stacks of ribbed bumpers, old
and NOS and more parts then I'd ever seen for a private not for sale person,
pretty amazing I must say, 

Now to the tow vehical 1980 Fo#d F150 4X4 step side short bed, 351 Windsor
engine, auto
gas mileage  6-8 loaded, 9 mpg empty, went 650 approx. miles today 80
gallons (approx.) fuel _at_$1.67 to $2.15 a gallon

came back empty as the other side loader single cab I found in L.A. couldn't
be seen till after 5 p.m. and i needed to get home 14 hours total trip.
