Hey, trip reports are just like any other thread you don't like....if you
don't want to read it, then just delete it.  I have never once seen a trip
report disguised under a sneaky title like &quot;motor help&quot;, so it's not like it's
terribly hard to pick them out and delete them.  I personally find them very
interesting, and often quite informative...these people many times have the
same problems I do while travelling in a VW, and tell how they managed to fix
it while on the road.  This info can be helpful if you read it and store it in
that dark part of your brain to use when you're stuck on the side of the road
between LA and Phoenix and it's 115 outside...

Katie
