Subject: 67 Westy Parts Swap
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I recently bought a '67 Westy that gets the wifes nod of approval. If you 
recall I had previously purchased a &quot;67 that I felt guilty about enough to 
hide it from my wife. The bus had been hit but ran well and had a good 
interior. Well, I am about to unload my guilt by selling it off to a guy who 
wants to take on the resto. My question to the list is: What parts are only 
'67 parts and which parts should I look at swapping out. I have already taken 
the black box, wiper arms, some interior swapped out. Also the rear apron was 
swapped. Anything else the list recommends looking at before I sell her off. 
Remember I want to leave enough for the next owner. So door handles (67 
only?) master are off limits. In the beginning I felt guilty canibalizing the 
bus but as soon as I saw the parts in the new bus those old parts came back 
to life!

Thanks.
