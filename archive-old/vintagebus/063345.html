&gt;&quot; The VW bus was never just a means of transport, it has always been a
&gt;emotive cult object &quot;  A quote of Dr. Pischetsrieder, cotb of VW AG.

Huh?  &quot;Mit Ihm fahrt der Erfolg&quot; and pictures of how many crates you
could stuff in a Bus didn't seem to be selling a cult object to me.

&gt;It's looks like VW is playing with the true enthusiast, using what we
&gt;have been doing for years to justify and promote the next ugliest VW
&gt;after the 411,

The New Beetle, even though it's a Golf in a Beetle suit, is &quot;cute&quot;
(this can be good or bad) but looks reasonably like a real Beetle.
The &quot;New Bus&quot; is just fugly.  IMHO it's uglier than the 411.

&gt;Now if they would only support the ones that created  &quot;THE CULT&quot;

They need to do something.  Googling around finds that VW's US
market share was 5% in 1960.  In 1998 (before NB launch) it was
less than 1%.  For 2001 it was 2.1%.

PS I think Thom was objecting to the implied Porsche reference...
