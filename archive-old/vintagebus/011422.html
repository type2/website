Well it does seem like maybe a waste of bandwidth but what the hay.

388
KN 221 GRGREEN 585578

so i figure the 59 was manufactured, or at least dated, march 18 1960 (our
birth days are only a couple weeks apart :) ) and i figure KN is german for
canada, and grgreen is seagull grey and mango green - and 585578 is well
.. but what does 388 stand for - seems odd becuase it isnt on the page

so could if there are errors above, and if someone knows what 388 really
means - please let me know
thanks
