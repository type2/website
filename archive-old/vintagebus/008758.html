I had a few e-mails off-list from our American brethren as to the Total VW
subscription details. They do have a website, but there is nothing on it!
Anyway, I thought I'd stick the details on the list for all to see. Whilst
I'm at it, I really should recommend the magazine of the Split Screen Van
Club. It's bi-monthly and well worth the membership fee on its own. (Good
job Steve and Jon!)
You can find details of the club at:    http:\\www.ssvc_dot_org_dot_uk

Anyway, as for TVW, they've got a credit card hotline to order: +44 (0)
01244 663 426  (visa)

Or you can write to:     Total VW
                                   Jazz Publishing
                                   The Old School House
                                   Higher Kinnerton
                                   Chester
                                   CH4 9AJ
                                   England

To subscribe, it costs £58 in total for a year. I know it sounds a lot, but
in Britain we pay over the odds for everything. Cars and magazines are the
perfect example. However, it's well worth it !
