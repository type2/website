Subject: Re: [VB] Run the thermostat or not?

Decided to go ahead and put the thermostat in.  Figure it will probably help
and can't hurt.  Drilled and tapped the case and got all the parts.
Installed it all tonight.  Never could get the thermostat to where it would
go from flaps completely to completely open.  Adjusted it so the flaps are
partially open cold to wide open hot.  better that what I had before.  Are
there different style brackets and rods for different sized engines?

&gt; I would listen to Eric And Barb on this. Yes, you see a LOT of used
engines
&gt; without their factory thermostat and flaps, but how many miles are on
them?
&gt; From raw experience in the eighties, I can tell you that a motor with the
&gt; thermostat and flaps in good operating order on a good motor will outlast
&gt; one without the proper equipment. I have built hundreds of motors and
dozens
&gt; for myself, my experience says go with the thermostat and flaps on street
&gt; engines. If you are racing or sand bogging, that is a different situation.

&gt; &gt; You might have to let her warm up a bit, but one of the selling points
of
&gt; an
&gt; &gt; air cooled engine is how fast it warms up.
&gt;
&gt; Hi Carl,
&gt; Yes, but then it cools down so much especially when idling and hardly
&gt; reaches
&gt; a minimum of 160 oil temp to keep not only the water vapor out of the oil,
&gt; but also keep alot of raw fuel out of the oil!  Plus you get better ring
&gt; longevity and better sealing (= more HP) when up to proper engine temp.
&gt; Lastly your engine does not tear itself slowly apart due to constantly
&gt; changing shape and size due to these large fluctuant engine temps.
