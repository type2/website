I have to second what John is saying about VMW (John, whats my cut for
the endorsment;-) ) .  I also have no affliation with VMW.  In my
dealings with them they have been honest, and very helpful.  

If you've not bought from them and are thinking about it, I don't think
you can go wrong.  The tool box I bought from them was missing a tool. 
When I contacted them by e-mail, they responded VERY quickly and sent me
not only the missing tool, but an other complete set of tools.  Good
people.


Steve
