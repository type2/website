Hi Chris,
The front linkage piece no, the 1960 thru early 62 model Chassi No. 835 088 
is what you want.  Do save the front linkage from the 58 it is good trading 
material!  The 58 rear linkage is probably the same used in the 1960, but can 
not say for sure.  Our 1958APR parts book does not show what was used in 
1960-early 62 and our later bus parts book shows only the rear shift linkage 
used from early 62.  Does anyone out there have a 1960-61 bus parts book?
