Subject: Another frickin' engine pull
Date: Fri, 8 Sep 2000 12:51:33 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Well it looks like I'm going to have to pull my engine again.  I'm really
starting to hate this 1776 of mine because of having to redo so god damn
much after treading so lightly for so long and I still screwed up.  I know
it sounds like I'm a bitter old man but from the time I placed the order for
my CB heads to the time they arrived was 10 to 12 days.  I hooted, hollered,
and talked about my 044 heads with the dual valve springs, large valves,
etc. the whole time and yet not ONE person stepped forwards to remind me to
pull out the extra spring.  It was only AFTER I did my marathon engine pull
and reinstallation that a few people with good intentions started to tell me
you should have pulled them, you should have done this and that.  Well good
god - why didn't anyone tell me before?  I kind of feel like the list let me
down and I can only wonder what the next engine pull and installation is
going to bring up.  I'll probably have it installed and someone will say,
&quot;Did you do this and that to your connecting rods?&quot;  Geez - that's all I
need - another reason to go deeper.  Maybe I just need to leave the engine
sitting on the bench for year completely disassembled while everyone thinks
up ideas of stuff I need to do.

I appreciate the help and put explicit trust in the list and what everyone
has to say but I must also add that this has been the most confusing engine
rebuild I've ever done (and I've rebuilt several engines of various designs
over the years.).  Despite all that I've read and done, it really gets to be
a PITA when you think you know what you need to do and then you are told
completely different.  I ask IS there really a &quot;right&quot; way to build an
engine?  There sure as hell are a million different ways to do it - I should
know because I think I've heard a billion...

Anyway, in one last desperate attempt to follow list advice, I've asked Rob
to come down from Omaha to help me out.  If things work out for him to help
me, then I'm going for it one last time.  If anything after this requires
yet another engine pull, it will be the last time I pull an engine.  I will
immediately put the engine up for sale, pay off the VISA, and settle down
and enjoy the benefits of stock design.
