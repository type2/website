Subject: Re:  [VB] Fan Belt Broke  (long)
To: philflick_at_hotmail_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

&lt;long story snipped&gt;
BTW: Do keep up on looking at parts that can wear. When the fan belt flew, 
it took out the fresh air tubes and my oil temp sender (I use a temp guage). 
A loss that never needed to happen.

I agree 150%.  I had a fan belt snap in my 61 deluxe while on a trip to CA.  
We were in the Siskiyoos.    I had tools, but NO fan belt.   Luckily coasted 
to near a gas station, where I purcased an overpriced fan belt. But, the 
fresh air hose was destroyed.  duct taped the hole in the fan shroud closed, 
and  drove on S on  I-5.  shortly smelled a horrible smell.  Stopped bus in 
sleety rain, crawled under th right side, and removed the partly melted 
rubber (from baywindow?) heat tube between heater box and body.    Got fresh 
air tube in next town. 
  I learned that
 the fresh air tubes are crucial as a part of the cooling system (as the 
heater box became much hotter without it), 
always make sure you have a spare fan belt or two (I knew that already),
 and have since prefered the plastic fresh air tube as anti fan belt whip 
protection, at least on the right side.
