No defense needed. That is a beautiful rig. It is good to know you were able to get them to do some customizing. I am in the same boat. Two little kids, building a house and work. I am thinking of having someone do my Crew Cab for me. Of course then the money has to come from some
where. Awesome bus and I can't wait to see it done. Excellent color choices.
