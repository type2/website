I don't think the term &quot;pedigree&quot; really could apply to buses.  They all
pretty much come from the same &quot;parents&quot; with only slight branches in the
family tree, ie Wolfsburg vs Hannover vs Brazil.  Mexico?  Maybe
if a bus was created from parts of other buses, that would alter it's
pedigree?  If that's the case, then my '54 will have quite the list!

One aspect which *does* come into play, even more so in makes other than
VW, is *provenance*, which is the bus's history as it pertains to
who owned it, where it had been, etc.  Some people will pay a substantial
premium for something that was owned by someone famous.  And there
is sometimes a premium for original-logo'd buses.  Sports car people pay 
more for cars that have raced at specific venues, ie LeMans, Mille Miglia, 
etc, and even more so if the car did well.  Anyone have a bus they raced _at_
LeMans?  I wonder how fast they got it on the old version of the 
Mulsanne straight...

Another element of provenance as it applies to vehicles are examples
with very, very low mileage; people usually try to get a premium for
such cars.  If you want to put the thing in a warehouse and sell it 
to the next guy on the same basis, or display it in your living room,
then that makes sense.  But if you drive it, you're pissing away what
you paid the premium for.
