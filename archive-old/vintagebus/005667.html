Well, after Thom Fitzpatrick showed me a picture of his right hand drive
floors that he had made, I decided that I could make it myself.  I'm asking
Santa for a bead roller this X-Mas, and I'm pretty sure that I can make my
own.  If this winter project comes out ok, I'll make some extras for the
people that need it (for a reasonable price). I've already started working
on the templates. I'll post some pics on my website as I go.

&gt; I had a hard time trying to get the front floor for my 65 DC. The only
place
&gt; you will be able to get the piece you need is from a donor. Even then,
many
&gt; people wont cut it out for you cause its a real pain to get one out
without
&gt; thrashing it. For my car I found a list member (Ton Mink) who took pitty
on
&gt; me and hacked the floor out of a single cab for me(Tom, the floor looks
&gt; great!). He even shipped it here, the kind soul he is! Keep your eyes
peeled
&gt; on all the sites and lists for wrecked or junked busses. Lots of busses
have
&gt; the part you need cause its usualy the ends near the dog legs that rot
away.
&gt; The PO of my DC used a metal trash can and wood screwes to make a floor.
&gt; Looked nice, but im a real stickler for stock :) Good luck!

&gt; I'm not sure if parts needed is acceptable on the list, but I really need
a

&gt; front floor section for my 64 bus.
&gt;
&gt; I'm not looking for the reproduction side panels by the doors (though mine
&gt;
&gt; are gone). I need the WHOLE front floor.
&gt;
&gt; I have nothing to bolt the shifter to, or anything like that. Does anyone
&gt;
&gt; know of a source that either sells a replacement panel or a good used one?
&gt;

&gt; sorry, cant help.   I cut a large piece of a junked bus to get a
replacement
&gt;
&gt; front floor for my 61 w/ OE safaris and thus swiss cheese front floor.
&gt;
&gt; BTW, the shifter does not bolt to the floor on a 64, but to  piece under
&gt; the
&gt; floor, through the floor.
