&lt;&lt; Anyway, does this interior look familiar to anyone?&gt;&gt;
Hi Kevin,
Well it could be a Sundial or Riveara camper.

 &lt;&gt;
Well yes and no.  It never came from the VW factory with the camper interior
that it has in the cargo and rear areas.  This was converted either at the VW
dealership or a American camper conversion shop.  Due to the huge demand for
the Westie and the low production of this official VW conversion.  Other shops
world wide took up the task of converting panel vans into campers.  Eric &amp;
