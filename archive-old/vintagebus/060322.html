Subject: Re: [VB] Forged or not

It is currently a 1600 DP. Since I'm rebuilding it, I could go bigger but I'm don't care much about
speed. My goal is to build an engine that will last longer than a stock rebuild. I thought that if I
got a forged CW crank and forged P&amp;C's I could get more miles out of it. True or no?

What size motor is it.  For a 1600 that won't get past 5000 rpm I think
a cast unit if fine.  I'm using a CB cast CW 69 mm crank.  7K so far and
no problems.  Very smooth motor.

&gt; Also, should I pop for forged P&amp;C's?
