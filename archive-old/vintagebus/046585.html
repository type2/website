&lt;&lt; If you bite the bullet *now* and replace all the bearings and seals,
 they'll be good for quite a number of years.   If you're planning on 
 travelling to BFE, prepare the bus ahead of time.  Maybe it's just me,
 but it seems like some people find the notion of taking a bus with unknown
 mechanicals to hell and back part of the fun (aka jerry jess award) - not me.
 I guess I have better things to do with my life than sitting on the side
 of the road swearing at my bus, or helping the AAA guy load it on a flatbed
 (both of which I've done...) &gt;&gt;
    I too like to have a bus that has been adequately prepared for long 
trips. I have taken this approach in the past with the entire bus, and still 
had RB problems. This was with a complete freeway flyer built by carters 
gearbox (I've only heard good) shop. So I'm a little paranoid now. I have 
also heard tales of recently rebuilt boxes blowing bearings on long trips. I 
will often drive the bus for 10+ hours without to much rest when going back 
east to visit family, and would hate to spend half of a two week vacation 
dealing with busted RBs. Was my experience just bad luck, or have others had 
problems with rebuilds? I also would like to lower my engine RPMs but living 
in the Willamette Valley, I don't feel that a freeway flyer is the answer. 
Are there other tried and true methods for early buses?
