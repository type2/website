Subject: misc sunroof questions for 60 sunroof
Message-ID: &lt;19990601150728.17062.qmail_at_nw178_dot_netaddress_dot_usa_dot_net&gt;

Hi All-

I am in the midst of replacing the sunroof cover on my 60 sunroof kombi and
have a few questions.

A while ago this thread was explored and it was mentioned that 

&quot;on the bottom/front lip of the front bow, there should be a thin bead of
rubber weatherstrip that goes bewteen the metal bow and the cover fabric. When
the sunroof is closed, this hidden weatherstrip forms the seal at the front of
the sunroof to keep water fro blowing in while you drive&quot;

Can anyone shed any more light on what this mysterious piece of
weatherstripping looks like?

Also does anyone know where to get a correct headliner for this year of bus?
The original headliner looks to be made out of tufted cotton (is it called
&quot;mousefluff&quot;???) I would like to find as close to a correct headliner. 

Any help would be appreciated!

m.
