&gt; The fuel line simply decided to give up I guess--nice that Woody decided to 
&gt; do so in our driveway instead of in Portland where we were Saturday night.  
&gt; The hose was so fragile that I crushed part of it with my fingers as I was 
&gt; chopping off ends and trying to reconnect it.  All went well, we lost not 
&gt; more than half a gallon, probably more like a quart on the driveway and no 
&gt; smokers happened past....

Hi Volks,
Hopefully you did that just for a quick fix!  Best to replace ALL flexible 
fuel lines every two to three year tops or risk BBQing your VW and possibly 
you!!!!
