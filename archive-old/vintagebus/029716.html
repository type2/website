This may be funny to some of you...

Recently, I sold a 1/2 rack and agreed to ship it via Greyhound to Florida.
 Greyhound has 2 maximum sizes - 34x34x24 and 54x74x24 (don't take this
to heart, I'm going on memory right now)

I measured my rack and came up with 50x70x16.  Ok, I'm good to go.  I mounted
the rack on my car and took it over to Greyhound last Friday night.  Side
note - don't ever go to Greyhound on Friday night, it's a total nightmare
situation.  People everywhere, phone ringing off the hook, etc., etc.  Naturally,
I got the new guy, to which I explained what I was doing and then told him
how to do his job.  About 45 minutes later, we had it weighed and tagged
and ready to go.  Cool, I think, and head home.

1/2 hour later when I get home, there's a message telling me to come pick
up the rack, it's too big.  WTF?!?  I call up Tim, the guy who &quot;helped&quot;
me and he says, &quot;My boss says it's too big, you'll have to come pick it
up.&quot;
&quot;But it's smaller than your maximum size of 54x74x24,&quot; I argue.
&quot;My boss says it's too big, we can't ship it.&quot;
&quot;Fine, I'll come pick it up tomorrow morning, I can't make it back there
before you close.&quot;  I say
&quot;Ok, there will be a $2 storage charge,&quot; Tiem replies.
&quot;What?!?  I said I can't make it back before you close, I'm not paying you
to store it.&quot;
&quot;Sorry, there's a $2 storage charge per piece per day.&quot;
&quot;Fine, I'll see you tomorrow, I'm not paying the $2.&quot;

The next day I head back over there at 8 am, right when they open.  The
boss man is there and I explain to him how it's not too big, I called 3
Greyhound stations to make sure before I brought it down in the first place.
&quot;But it's 50x70x16, that's bigger than 54x74x24,&quot; he says.
&quot;How is that?&quot;  I ask
&quot;Well 50 is bigger than 24&quot;
&quot;Huh?  50 is less than 54,&quot; and I point to their size chart to show that
50 is less than 54 and 70 is less than 74 and 16 is less than 24.  &quot;It's
less!&quot; I state.

He looked puzzled and went to measure it again.  &quot;Oh, you're right, it will
fit.&quot; he mumbled.

There was no mention of the $2...
