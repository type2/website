Subject: looking for Blue DC 4 sale at OCTO

Does anyone have contact info. for the guy who was
selling the blue Doublecab in the show area (looked
like worn OG paint, nice rims/tires/interior) at OCTO?
I can't find it on the Samba, and I have someone who
might be interested.
I didn't write the name/info. down at the show - Doh!

Anyone?

Jason
