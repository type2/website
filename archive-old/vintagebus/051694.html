Subject: Re: [VB] CB valve covers?

they are probably worse than the stock covers.  More prone to leaks and
they don't reject heat as well as the sheet metal covers painted black.

they sure look kewl, though.

&gt; Happy friday everyone,
&gt; Now that I have remembered what day it is I have an appropriate
&gt; question. In the BBB raffle I won some CB Performance cast aluminum
&gt; finned bolt-on valve covers. I am not going to get rich by selling
&gt; them, so I think I might just put them on the bus. While I don't
&gt; expect higher speed or greater torque or bolt-on power, there is no
&gt; harm in using these things, is there? They won't over-cool my cylinder
&gt; heads or anything will they? (I do have functioning thermostat and
&gt; flaps)
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Joel and the '64 Sundial
