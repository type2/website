&lt;&lt; crawling under my bus after a tough 250 mile drive home. (long story) I  
realized that my shift coupler was in very bad shape(couldnt find 2nd gear at 
all being a clue.) i noticed the source of my recent loss of tranny fluid. it 
appears to be coming from the nose cone where the shift comes in.  My 
questions, Is it possible to remove the nose cone without dropping the tranny?
..................
no, not really.  You need to remove the RGBoxes from the spring plates to 
change the front mount, so you certain ly will for this deal.  Pull motor, 
pull tranny.   , 
.................
 and if so, could i replace something inside to stop the leak, or should i go 
about aquiring a new one?  
  &gt;&gt;
there is a seal  that should be there.  rarely are they in good shape- nose 
cone hockey stick seal..
how bad is it leaking?
