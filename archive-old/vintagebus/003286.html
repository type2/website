Well fine. Then I'll put a window in the door down low like on semi trucks
and make it a safari. Should work perfect. Or maybe the fresh air intake
vents off a 50's Chevy pickup. Just like the crotch coolers on early bugs.
Put 'em on backwards and call it good. Sounds like a sweet deal and I can do
what I want to my buses anyway, they're a bunch of horror shows even though
they have no rust.

&gt; heat rises and goes out there just that much quicker.  The best solution
&gt; would be to have a window way low in the body instead.  Also the person
who
&gt; cracks open a slider or wing window get most of the heat on that side of
the
&gt; front seat due to the heat heading out that window
