don't unplug anything your not sure about.  Just so you know you can
lock the door by first pressing down the lock button then holding the
handle down (outside handle) as you close the door.  Then when it
latches let go of the handle and it locks.  This is done so you get
locked out.  So yes, there is a way to lock your doors without using
the key.
Please, does anyone know what relay it is if it is a relay for the
seat belt interlock?  Something is wrong on my car.  If your buckled
before you start the car the warning buzzer doesn't go off but the
seat belt light stays on when as it always does.  But without the
seatbelt it has the warning buzzer and the same seat belt light for a
few seconds.  It's supposed to prevent you from starting too but it
doesn't.  What could be the cause of this?

It's not likely that I would leave my keys there anyway, since you
have to
have the key to lock the driver's side door.  Thanks in advance.

unplug it.   its a black relay above the fuse box.
