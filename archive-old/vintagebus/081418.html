Subject: Heater Tube

Now that it's almost November the winter weather is just around the corner. I
have a 1966 Westfalia that lost it's center heating tube many years ago. I
have decided to replace the tube and get the heating system working once
again.

I would like to use some PVC piping to replace the missing center tube. Does
anyone know the dimensions of this tube?

I don't drive the bus all that often in the winter, but every once in awhile I
like to take it out when the weather is dry.

In the coming weeks I will be pulling the engine to replace a leaking main
seal. I am at that time going to give the thermostat/spring assembly on the
heater box a little attention to ensure that it is working properly. I'm not
too familiar with that apparatus, but it doesn't look too complicated.

In the meantime, I'm scraping and sanding underbody parts and applying a
couple of coats of rustoleum primer to give it some protection. I'll also be
taking on some body rust repair for the first time. I'm not expecting show
quality results, but I have a nice warm garage to work in and I don't have to
depend on my bus for transportation so I'm looking forward to some relaxing
time during the cold weather months improving my bus.

I've learned through the years that the most rewarding part of bus ownership
is becoming involved in repair and maintenance.
Relying on others to do things correctly and in a timely fashion has just
resulted in frustration and unnecessary expense.
The only people I trust to work on my bus are my friends in Wisconsin that I
camp with. If we can't do it. It won't get done.
I hope everyone has a good fall/winter season.
