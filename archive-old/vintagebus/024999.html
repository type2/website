Anyone have any tips on excessive freeplay in the steering wheel?
There is so much slack when I turn the wheel, that steering has become
more like &quot;tacking&quot; as in a sailboat.
Does this indicate problems in the steering box? Or, would the culprit
be tie-rod ends?
I'd appreciate some pointers...
Also, the solution to my starter problems has turned out to be shorter
and newer battery cables.
This weekend was the first time I was able to put any miles on my bus
since
the engine rebuild, and I might add, the first time I rebuilt an engine
on anything and had it turn out successfully.
What a great feeling to listen to it come to life.
