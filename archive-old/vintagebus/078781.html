Subject: Re: [VB] 12 volt flasher on 65 bus

If it is the 9-prong '66-'67 box, there's really no need to get rid of it.
They're really well made, and I've made a habit of picking them up at VW
show flea markets for a dollar or two. When Matt Roberds was up in Trenton
NJ at this year's Tour de Sol, I presented him with an earlier, simpler
model (with a bow on it and everything!) than the one he based his article
on, opened up so he could examine it. He told me that most problems people
report to him are dirty connections or poor grounds in the light wiring
circuits, homemade wiring, and of course when rain has gotten past the
windshield and dripped down on the box for years...

Matt's article and Charles approach can be godsends if you can't locate a
replacement 9-prong box. There's just nothing wrong with the box itself, and
it doesn't deserve to get a bad reputation. All of the ones I've picked up
still work!

Hi Mheron,
Is your bus a 1965 model or built after the begining of AUG1965 which would
make it a 1966 model bus???  If a 1955-65 bus you just need a two or three
prong signal relay box from almost any FLAPS.
  If you have a 1966-67 bus, the 1966 and 1967 blinker boxes have nine
connections and are just the same other than the 6 volt and 12 volt changes
between
these years.  One can make a replacement blinker box from standard FLAPS
signal relays for these two years of bus production by reading Matt Roberds
article
on &quot;VW 9 Prong Box Troubleshooting and Replacement&quot; in the type2_dot_com Library
in the &quot;Electrical (Secondary)&quot; section.

Here's a diagram of what I'm talking about.  This is the cheapest way to
convert to 12 volts, and do away with the magic 'black box'.

Later
