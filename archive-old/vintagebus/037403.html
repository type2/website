&lt;&lt; The last time I adjusted the cable, I had the stock two nut adjusters on 
it. Now, since my tranny work was done, I have the supposedly easier to 
adjust wing not adjuster. Does anyone have some tips on how to adjust this 
puppy?  Mine is STUCK. &gt;&gt;
Hi Derrick,
Did you install the wing nut type of arm the end of the clutch cable goes 
through?  That type is a straight arm with a diamond shaped hole through it 
for the wing nut to lock into so it does not back off without a locking nut 
against it.  If the wingnut is locking too well by these knubs you might file 
them down a bit to lessen thier effect and make it easier to adjust by hand.  
We have found with post-1967 VWs with the wingnuts that the only way to 
adjust them by hand was to remove the left rear wheel to allow more direct 
access and leverage to the wing nut while reaching over the brake drum and 
axle to get in there.  If you are still using the pre-1968 curved arm you 
need to file off the locking knubs off the forward side of the wing nut or it 
will tend to twist and eventually break the cable at incorrect angles.  We 
have used this latter setup with no problems and utter ease of adjustment.  
  Whichever type of setup you installed did you at least grease the threads 
of the new clutch cable so they did not rust up?  Also a dandy idea to run a 
die to chase the threads on the clutch cable end to insure the threads are 
properly machined and not banged up from shipping.  Eric&amp;Barb
