Does anyone have an old shifter for a 64 Bus?  I have one of those quick
shifts with reverse handle, and would rather have a stock shifter. Since I
am one of those newly laied off workers in San Francisco area, I can not pay
a whole lot.

I do have parts to trade, such as 009 dist, almost new duel throat carb
(generic) + intake manafolds, brand new fan shroud and more.
