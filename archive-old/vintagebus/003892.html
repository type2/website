&gt;Well Eric,
&gt;I don't know what to tell you then.  The numbers under the pushrod tubes

&gt;the casting numbers. (see Volksworld December 1999 page 90).  I have heard

&gt;that factory replacement cases came without serial numbers. Can anyone
&gt;confirm this?

Gary and all,

    When I replaced the motor in the Ghia I used to own, I bought a new
Brazilian AS-41 case from Gene Berg that had no numbers from the factory.
It was kind of funny because at the time, I was living overseas in the
Philippines where engine numbers are recorded on import paperwork at the
time your car has it's entry inspection.  When I went to export my car back
to the States, the inspector spent almost an hour looking really puzzled and
pouring all over the engine looking for the numbers that I knew he would
never find :-)  When asked about where the numbers went, I just shrugged,
put on my best &quot;Chevy owner's face&quot; and said ,&quot;I dunno, I just put gas in
the thing. . .&quot;  :-)  He finally gave up looking and rubber-stamped my
papers.  It's a good thing he did too, 'cause that would have opened up a
HUGE can 'O worms for me trying to explain where the old engine went.
