Jeremiah,
             Welcome to the talk list.  I'm not sure if we've met before but 
I thought I'd send some info your way.  Neato has a local chapter based out 
of G'Ville called Das Kool Bulli's  and I'm trying to get River City Bulli's 
(JAX) affiliated with Neato.  If you don't know them already you might want 
to look up Kris Heinicka (contact person &amp; organizer for DKB)  He drives a 
dove blue '59 around G'ville.  Also in the area are David Engle ('66 Hippy 
Panel) and Lorne Johnson ('67 velvet green Kombi &amp; '58 Binz owner).  Close 
by in Ocala is Kevin ? at Busbones (he also has several splits and I believe 
a Binz Crew Cab also)  If your ever in the Jacksonville area, particularly 
Neptune Beach
stop by, I love Beer &amp; VW conversation. Also mark down April 8th on your 
calender, we are having an all bus show this Sat.  The condition of your bus 
is not important.  If its not restored we will also be giving away awards 
for ugliest &amp; rustiest buses.  Swapping is encouraged in front of your Bus.  
Hope to see ya there if not sooner.
