&lt;&lt; Well Got the stub axle in and torqued but con not get the top shock mount 
to
 start threading in.  Is it a treaded tube or is it a tube with a nut on the 
end.  I look in it and it looks like at one time it was treaded but the bolt 
goes way further in than those threads and then feels like it is hitting a 
nut.  You can not really see what is behind the mount but there is a little 
place you can put a finger in and feel a solid tube that the bolt is going 
into.  Another finger and feel around to the back side and it feels like a 
nut is ont the end of the tube.  Can I run a tap and die through there to
 see if it just a burr stoping the starting of the treads or any other ideas. 
 Now gotta find a tap and die  to use?  Anybody got one.  Has to be pretty 
big for a shock mounting bolt.  Come on help me out as the BIG SHOW is 4 days 
away and I am getting frustrated.   Was just wanting your input. &gt;&gt;
Hi Rob,
All four shocks on each of thier ends are mounted with a long bolt through 
both the end of the shock and suspension mounting point.  Tightened in place 
with a split lock washer and nut.  You might want to run a drill bit through 
the suspension point to clean out the bore and then apply a little grease 
over the length of the bolt to prevent futher corrosion in the future.
