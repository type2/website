Look NQ your not going to give up. Look i know Thom wasn't born with his 
skill to restore His flock of buses. Look Nq im not the smartest guy around 
but i know that if you put your mind to it you can get a decent looking bus 
and you can learn to do the body work all you need is a Mig welder. Look i 
know you wont stop and if you do i will probely have to fly or bus to 
beatrice nebraska so look keep on going and As YOU said Your bus will no 
longer will look like a piece of crap so have faith and keep on going

Done his pep talk for today Sincerly Kirin Jacobsen
