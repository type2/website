Rimco sells counterweighted stock cranks , and has for almost 30 years, 

plus get a set of their rebuilt rods, the weigh them so they are in the same 
weight group and bore the set together so they are the same length. 

Rimco is the place for  any VW machine work.....

see their ad in Hot VW.....
