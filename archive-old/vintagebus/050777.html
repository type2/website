Subject: Racks and tents

Does anyone know if the tents for RHD Buses were different than LHD
buses? I want to double up the tents on my  DD EZ (one on both sides)
and I was wondering if there is a difference. I know the tent I have now
has cut out for a Westy rack so would they be in a different place if
the tent was hanging off the opposite side of the Bus? I would think so.

Also speaking of racks, what's a ballpark price on a decent sloped Westy
rack? Complete all there (including clamps) wood needs to be stained
again.

Thanks,
Greg
