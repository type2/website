Hi Chris,
You can shatter (Just like glass!) the broken tap with punch and a hammer.
Then fish out the broken pieces with a good magnet attached to a long nail or
machinist scribe.  The magnet will magnetize the nail or scribe and attract
the hardend pieces of tap.  Then very carefully tap the hole.  If you feel the
slightest resistance you might want to pull out the tap and clean the hole
with the magnet again.  Remember that when using a tap you want to turn the
tap one turn in then a half turn back, then a turn in, and again a half turn
out again and so on.  This prevents chips of steel from getting to long and
the tap in the hole.  You should also check your tranny reduction bolts
tightness every 1,000 miles for the first 3,000 miles after installing the
bolts on the back of the reduction gear box and there after every so often
when you tune your bus.  You also might want to reduce the foot lbs. to the
stock 85 ft lbs, the bolts you are using might be rated for higher but the
material of the boxes might not.  Make sure you use locking washers and grease
the bolts well to prevent rusting in place.  we do not recommend changing your
reduction gear boxes to later ones unless you change the front suspension and
brakes first.  Installing the later rear reduction boxes will nessatate using
later wider stronger brakes.  Which probably make the rear brakes lock up
before the front ealier brakes you have now.  Causing the bus to do 180 degree
turns all of the sudden especially in wet or icy conditions.  VW since the
early 50s have made the front brakes stronger than the rears to prevent this
problem.    The bolts you are using right now are too soft.  You need to get a
grade 8 hardness ( 6 radial lines on the head signify this hardness.) or the
equivelant metric hardness.  Too soft of bolt will stretch like taffy and may
be the reason for your suddenly loose bolts.  Too hard and they will shatter
like glass.  Find a real fastener only shop and buy from them.  Do yourself a
favor and buy the Bentley reprint of the pre-1968 bus VW shop manual, it is
pricey but worth every cent.                                  Good Luck, Eric
&amp; Barb
