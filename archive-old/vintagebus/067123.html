Subject: RE: [VB] Crying kids and road trips- what music calms them
  down?

...
  believe it or not, the 3 week old sat and listened in awed silence 
to yoko ono's FLY  with me this morning  :)

also, he really dug the coltrane/dolphy box set i put on mp3 (he 
better, he's named for dolphy!)
sadly, he watched a sun ra live concert on dvd with me the other day, 
and was only mildly interested.
he is DEATHLY afraid of bach now, as he has some sort of mutant, 
vibrating mobile that plays bach and mozart and scares the bejeezus 
outta him. he did like harry partch on video last night, so maybe 
he's just a modernist.


i think you can see that while me and eric will be fine singing songs 
by, oh, the germs on roadtrips, my WIFE may well need some choices 
from this List  .....


bus content - as sson as he can hold my socket wrench (3-5 months?) 
he's helping me with the front end,


&gt;From: Jim Ellis [mailto:ellisjames_at_yahoo_dot_com]
&gt;Hypothetical 34 month old and 3 month old cry all the time. What music would
&gt;play while on the road, at the camp site or at home to cork their little pie
&gt;holes?
