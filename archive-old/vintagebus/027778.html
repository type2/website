Subject: Westy wanted NE GA area

Hello Friends,

Many of you in this area know my good friend, James Smyth, who has been
active in the bus community for the last several years... James is
looking to buy a westy NOW while he has money in pocket, before it gets
wasted on other things... I'm passing on his message, since he is
presently &quot;e-challenged&quot;...

He is looking for either an early bay westy (68 thru 71) with poptop,
with or without running gear (he has the running gear handy), OR a 74 or
later poptop westy complete, preferably running...

His home number is 706-376-7850, work 706-376-7181. He works most
evenings till 11pm, and will take calls at home no matter how late...

I'm willing to relay e-mail to him, also.

david
