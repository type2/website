Subject: 9 pin relay

The VR &amp; VL wires are supposed to be connected to the male riveted/diode
connections at terminal 49a of the red flasher at my 9 pin unit according to
my WW instructions. When they are connected and I press down on my brake
pedal, my turn signals burn ( not flashing). When I remove the VR &amp; VL leads
from the 49a red flasher, my bus is fully functional. However, now my
emergency flashers don't work up front, only at the back. So I need the VR
VL wires connected to the male riveted connections at 49a for my emergency
flasher system to work properly obviously. I guess I can always leave those
VR VL wires off dangling in the wind until I need to run my flashers in case
of an emergency. IS it possible that my grounds at the turn signals
(grounded to the front panel frame) are not strong enough and that's why
when the VR VL is connected to the red flasher and when I press down on the
brake pedal, the turns burn bright? Obviously, pressing the brake pedal,
provides juice to the VR VL wires because they all are running through
terminal 49a of the red flasher (BLK/Red male diode- brake, BLK/Violet -
54st, VR VL). Maybe my bus is one big rust bucket!
