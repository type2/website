Subject: Re: [VB] Angle of Dangle

A split BUS(not a bug, which does have more preload and is dangerous) spring
plate does not have the preload. 20 degrees is less than an inch below the
lower stop, meaning in stock position the plate when pried off the lower
stop will swing down less than an inch, I have a hard time beliving there
would be much difference from bus to bus.  I used a prybar to pull it off
the stop(if you look in your bently you'll see the same thing, doubt they
would do that with a dangerous preload) and a jack to lift it up. I didn't
use a chain and I wasn't EXTRA careful, or lucky. There just wasn't any
danger. No more so than anytime you have a vehicle on jack stands.





&gt;
&gt; A friend of mine, the one with the busted left knee, would like to argue
the
&gt; point with you about the floor jack. I have seen many methods with floor
&gt; jacks and chains and whatever. A lot of people get away with it without
any
&gt; bodily damage, just lucky and EXTRA careful I guess. For the rest of us,
the
&gt; Bentley procedure is probably the safest. This subject had an awfully long
&gt; thread when I asked how to do mine a year ago.

&gt;
&gt; You don't really need a compression tool for bus plates, they dont have a
&gt; preload like a beetle. floor jack works well. I used a magnetic protractor
&gt; from sears. $5-$8 range
