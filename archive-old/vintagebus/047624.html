Subject: Move to Eugene, DONE!
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hey list.
My move to Eugene went well and I just got my net hooked up.
I'm still looking for a nice solid driver in the Eugene /springfield area.
The earlier bus, the better. I'm also interested in a nice crew cab????
I know somebody's got the stash out here. Come on guys, I can't go a block 
without seeing a bus of some sort:)
Take care,
Pete
