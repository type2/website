That's true Eric.  But there are ways of having them fixed/rebuilt.  THEN
the price goes up when a seller cannot only state they are working but
recently rebuilt professionally.
More than once I've bought the correct radio (not working) and installed
it in the dash.  I prefer that non working one to a radio shack $29.95
version working one.
half a dozen of one and 6 of the other......

&gt; &lt;&lt;This radio is in excellent condition and is a rare find. &gt;&gt;
&gt; &lt;&lt;There is no guarantees on the working condition of the radio, but I believe 
&gt; that it operates just fine. &gt;&gt;
&gt; Sapphire radios from the 1960s being all transistor if you by good condition 
&gt; used, but unknown radios of this type you are lucky to get a working one out 
&gt; of buying ten.
