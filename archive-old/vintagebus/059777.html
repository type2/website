Subject: Friday old photographs

Hey Volks

I was going through some of my mother's old photo albums
recently and was surprised to find a few old photographs of
splitties!

I have posted them for all to see on the vintagebus_dot_com
gallery.

Here they are:

This is a pic of an original zebra-striped African safari
bus, taken in Rhodesia in the early 1970s. It was buses like
this that inspired me to build the ZebraBus, which I
recently drove from Cape to Cairo and on to Germany.

This is a photograph of my grandfather (my mother's father)
standing next to his splitty camper in Australia in the late
1960s

My grandfather with the same bus, rear view.

Enjoy!
