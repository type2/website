Subject: Re: [VB] Spring plate angle - lost settings...

----- Original Message -----
From: &quot;George Lyle&quot; &lt;glyle_at_pon.type2_dot_com&gt;

&gt; &gt; Anything I should look out for whilst doing this - or anyone got any
tips on
&gt; &gt; how to make sure I get this right- I would prefer to not have to strip
down
&gt; &gt; and retry the settings if possible!
&gt;
&gt; When measuing the spring plate angle, be sure to lift the spring plate to
&gt; take the slack out of the splines.
&gt;

Ah - little problem didn't do that on the one I have fitted already.  Just
went back to it and tried lifting it and it did not seem to move - however I
have refitted the spring plate cover.  Should I pop this back off to check?
I assume this would restrict movement.

&gt; Resist the urge to crank in a little extra twist.  Stick with the specs!
&gt;
&gt; Measure twice, cut once.
&gt;
Er I don't really want to cut anything - oh perhaps you are sneakily trying
to tell me to change the angle to 0 degrees and cut the wheel arches out so
I can drag along the floor and look as kewl as hell!!!!!  lol!!

Thanks for your help!

Paul
