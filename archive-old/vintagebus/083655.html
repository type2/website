Subject: Re: [VB] Electric vs Mechanicle?

Hi Seth,
Mechanical is going to be more efficient and simpler.  Plus with  mechanical 
you do not have to special wire the fuel pump so it does  not just keep 
pumping fuel all over after the engine dies when a fuel line comes  loose.  
  You can rebuild the earlier mechanical fuel pumps on the side of the  road, 
and if you have a failure of the gen/alt it will not increase the drain  down 
of the battery.  Us having twice driven 700 miles home on just  battery power 
with a bad gen!!
  The only instances that we know of that electric fuel pumps work  better is 
if you convert to more modern high pressure fuel injection, or  are drag 
racing a dual carbed engine bigger than a 1776 cc.
