Subject: RE: [VB] Insulating the DC


I too will be insulating my bus this summer. There is an AWSOME how to
treatise at http://www.bulley-hewlett_dot_com/VWindex/intrir1.html
If anyone wants to call BS on this please do, because this guy seems to
have his act together. I plan on documenting the job for the archives. 

I have done just the &quot;rubberized asphalt with aluminum backing&quot; i.e.,
Dynamat$$ or roofing IceGuard. Worked wonders in a Honda I had.

I am planning on the iceguard on everything on the interior, and the
sound barrier in the engine compartment. The greatstuff scares me. The
roofing stuff (koolpatch) has me questioning, but I know that my
pristine ride will not stay rust free here on the east coast.

Anyone want to help soundproof and preserve a 1965 21 Window Deluxe in
Charlotte this summer? We can split the cost and do two (or more!)
busses, bugs or other vehicles!

4 things needed: 
   1. Time - the dynamat is cut, peel, and stick. For some reason, it
takes FOREVER. (A day)
   2. Aluminum backed asphalt - &lt;$80 for a bus. Total coverage isn't
needed. Something like 5% reduces 90% of noise!
   3. Asphalt tar stuff - ~$10
   4. Sound deadening insulation (the stuff you have. Sort of. Needs
heat resistant skin of aluminum to reflect radiant heat) - JC Whitney
has it for 4'x6' for $25 or 4'x24' for $80. My calculations say top,
front, sides probably 8' or three engine compartments worth. 

Would it be worth a weekend and $130 to have the quietest vw in town?
The last time I did just the dynamat and the engine and vibration noises
were gone. Wind noise became loudest. In my bus, I KNOW it is deafening.
