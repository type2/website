&quot;'65-'73 Westfalia Interior Interchangeability Notes 
by Michael Heron


Note: I have checked the part numbers in my Westy part manuals to ensure that the following parts are interchangeable. 

In restoring my 65' westy back to as original as possible, I have made a few insights as to the interchangeability of pre and post 67' Westies. As the van changed from the split window to the bubble window the westy interior changed just enough to make it infuriatingly not interchangeable. For example, the coldbox from a bubble window camper is approximately 2&quot; taller than the coldbox for my 65' Westy, and therefore not interchangeable without major surgery. Thus anytime I find any interchangeable parts I am just a little bit tickled. 

Here are my findings on interchangeability between my 65' Westy and bubble window Westies (up to 1973): 


The wood grain on the cabinets stayed the same from 65' (maybe back to 64?) up until 1971) 

That now famous yellow vinyl that covered the camper seats remained the same from 65 (maybe 64?) up until early 1973. Obviously the shapes of the seats etc. changed. 

The yellow and brown checkered curtains stayed the same from 65 (maybe 64?) up till 73'. The curtain material on the bubble windows was designed to cover up longer side windows, so some cutting needs to be done to fit a split, but finding this material in half decent shape is an accomplishment! 

The small washer like thing that site recessed in the floor that the leg of the dining table screws into the same remained the same from 65' to 72. 

The beige metal &quot;securing snaps&quot; that hold all of the cabinets remained the same from 65' to 73. 

The engine access hinges remained the same fro 64' to 74' (I know I am repeating myself).

Does an early bay Z-bed fit into a split?  I think the interior code 
should be SO-44, the most common one, with the clothes cabinet next to 
the Z-bed with the yellow vinyl covers.  If I understand correctly the 
SO-44 ran from 65 to at least 72.

Basically I need a z-bed bad and cannot find a splitty specific one to 
plop in.  Man I hope the bay Z-bed will fit!  Otherwise I will learn how 
to make one from scratch, yuck.

---

I found a &quot;Campmobile 80&quot; interior in a junkyard that had a full-width 
bed (and lots of nice birch!).  As I was tired of the view-blocking 
cabinet in my 71 westy (Campmobile 70) anyway, I swapped the beds out.

Now I've got a spare 3/4 width bed and I'm thinking of doing something 
similar to what you describe in my 65 bus, which came without a rear 
interior.  It will take a bit of tweaking, as I'd like to make it full 
width and the right-side (cabinet-side) brackets aren't made to mount on 
the wheel well like the other side is (the full-width version does). 
Can't use it as-is, anyway, as the floor of the bed unit conflicts with 
the heat log location.

My plan is to use the bed hardware, but cut new plywood to fit the 65's 
layout and make it full width if possible -- or I'll do what I did in my 
71 before I found the full width bed (pix at 
http://www.supernet_dot_net/~jclark/vw/71westy/page2.html
).  Should be pretty straightforward - I'll post pix if I ever do this.

Other than the heat log conflict, I think a bay bed will fit - mainly 
depends on height of the rear tray, slope down to cargo floor, and wheel 
well config.  In fact, seems like I already tested it once.
