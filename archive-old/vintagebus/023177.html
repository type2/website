Subject: Buses in the Shop, Tomorrow!
Mime-Version: 1.0

Yup...was over at Volks Authority all day today, cleaning up and arranging
cars for tomorrow's event!  Shuffled the cars around...I won't give away
all that will be there.  But we'll be showing off the raffle items and
handing out chips and chex mix from the Belgian Flower van...a late model
Bus, stretched by a coachbuilder and heightened to open up and act as a
giant display area!

Show starts at 10am...we'll be selling raffle tickets all morning...I think
we plan to start the raffle between 1 and 2pm.  I am going to do my best to
set up signs at the corner of Newhall and Coleman to help direct people to
the shop.  We spent a good deal of the day cataloguing the extra Bus rubber
and parts that were brought in just for tomorrow, so this will be the time
to get all the things you need for winter!

Volks Authority is located at 1098 Stockton Ave, San Jose.  Take the
Coleman Ave exit from Hwy 880, right next to the San Jose Airport.  Phone
is (408) 286-7306.  Maps and flyer are located at
http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/gallery/show.html ...third set of pictures down. :)

Hope to see lots of you there!
