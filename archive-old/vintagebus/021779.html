&lt;&lt; Hey all,
 
 I had the opportunity to check out a 67 Panel that was in decent general
 condition.  Had bad cancer on the passenger side dog leg and the forward
 most rocker behind the front whell on the passenger side, but other than
 that was pretty decent.  It moved (no frozen drums - woo hoo!), but I wasn't
 able to get it started.  I've got some ideas to that extent, but wondered
 about a few things.  There was no plate behind the passenger seat and none
 on the air box.  I went to the back to look in the engine compartment to see
 what the actual VIN was, and was unable to find it.  I looked where I
 *thought* it should be, but didn't see one.  Could it have been grinded off?
 The old farmer who had it says his son had it for at least 10 years when he
 died in an accident (not in the bus) about 8 years ago.  He always thought
 about restoring it, cuz that's what his son wanted to do, but he's never had
 the desire, so he's going to get rid of it.  Also, were most panels walk
 thoughs?  This one looks like it was a bench seat model who's bulkhead was
 decently hacked (if that's possible) into a walk through.  Since I have no
 m-code plate or VIN, I really have nothing to go on.  A little help from the
 list would be greatly appreciated.
 
 Thanks!
 Paul

hm...no Mcode plate, tag on air box removed, the number in the engine 
compartment by battery have been removed....  yup difficult to find out m 
codes.

no, most panels were not walkthroughs.  However the walkthrough panels tended 
to not have the 3 vents by the roof for ventilation of the interior, while 
bench seat panels did.   

What does the title say it is?
