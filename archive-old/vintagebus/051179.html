&gt; Well guys,
&gt; I came back to check my e-mail after posting this morning.......I believe 
&gt; there is enough interest.
&gt; 
&gt; Here is the scoop.....I am finalizing the artwork.  It will be a split bus 
&gt; graphic with vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com on it.  
&gt; 
&gt; They will be cut vinyl stickers.  I'll start of with white and black and 
&gt; worry about colors later.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not positive on price ...but don''t expect them to be higher than a few 
&gt; bucks.  I will probably tack a dollar on to donate to the list fund though.
&gt; 
&gt; I can mail some out......I will likely accept payment with a SASE and then 
&gt; send em out.
&gt; 
&gt; Regarding the type2 list....If there is interest I can possibly do a bay bus 
&gt; sticker too. We'll check that out.
&gt; 
&gt; Soon as i get the pic scanned, I'll post it to the web in a day or so.
&gt; 
&gt; I'll keep you guys updated via list and will have some for OCTO.
