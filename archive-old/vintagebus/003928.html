Umm, yes. The V8 is definitely superior for pulling the Indio hill towing
another bus. 3.08 rear for those keeping score. Westfailures came stock with
a 400 smallblock, I traded overheating for horsepower and went with the very
correct 360 HP crate engine. Don't like watercooled much for around town, so
I went with a much tamer 2275 in the singlecab. Reliable as a hammer and
musta got near to 10000 miles before the oil rings let go. (Good miles) 8^)
Should be back in the truck next weekend. Dear God driving around with a
1600 has been trying my patience. I had no idea that truck had a 4 speed in
it. I thought it was a two speed with two granny gears. It has a 3.88 Rancho
center in it, but with the small nut mountain boxes you wouldn't know it.
4000 rpm's at 53 mph. I'm gonna toss that in the shed and put a Rancho Pro
sand center in there. You don't need to be able to do more than 45 around
town anyway, and it would be really cool to win the slow drags and then
smoke the tires in 3rd. At least I think so.

&gt; Due to the fact that some will not be
&gt; happy with anything less than a V8 and others are happy with a 36HP engine
&gt; makes the choice of tranny gearing a very personal one.
