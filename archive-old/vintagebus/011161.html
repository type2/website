This worked for me in the past.

take the peddle pan off, have the girlfriend or neighbor

push the clutch peddle to the floor,  get under the bus   use blocks of wood 
to brace

&amp; hold it in place.

Go to the back, (I remove the wheel for better access,) clamp vice grips to 
clutch cable, lube the cable with your favorite.  

good luck.
