Subject: Another Westy question

Got some excellent responses from my last one so let me try another...
OK, on my walk-thru SO-42 westy there is the seat / cabinet right behind the
driver. On the bottom of the seat there is some kind of weird mount type
thingy. It's sort of  'L' shaped that's round on one end with notches in it
and a shaft coming out of it. Does anyone know what this thing is for?
Just another one of those questions I've been asking myself.

Thanks,
Jim
