Subject: 1776 Engine For Sale

Some friends of mine have a nice low miles engine for sale and they asked me
to post it to the net for them.  Here's the specs:

1776cc with Weber Progressive 2bbl carb.
Turnkey engine but they may want to keep the alternator.
non-cw crank (matter of fact, it's a bone-stock engine aside from the higher
displacement and carb.)
10,000 miles on rebuild done by a friend of theirsin Red Oak, Iowa that
rebuilds VW engines
single relief 1500/1600 case :-(

Only problem they know of is that when their boys drove it to Kansas City
from Beatrice a few weeks ago, it spat out oil along the rear apron.  The
boys cruised 70 to 75mph and in my opinion is a breathing problem by how
they described it to me.  Venting the valve covers would seem to me to be
the way to cure the problem.  Otherwise, at 60mph, they never had a problem
with the oil situation.

Engine runs great and plenty of power.

Reason for selling?

They've got a 67 project bug and just had another engine rebuilt for it by
Frank Musil in Lincoln.   They want to go back to bone stock engines that
are reliable and don't have &quot;issues&quot; that go along with high performance
design.  They would love to sell this engine and take the money to put
towards their nice old 67.

I'm planning on driving to Kansas City on the weekend of the 25th and anyone
interested in it from down there will get free shipping if I can take my bus
down there.

They were wanting $800 to $1000 for it but definitely told me they will
entertain offers as they really need the cash.

Contact Linda or Roy Swain at 402-223-2505 for more info.  This is in
Beatrice, NE.
