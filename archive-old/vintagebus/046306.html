 i'm considering a job offer in the tri-cities area of washington state.  i'd 
like to know if i'll have bus folks to hook up with in the area.  yup, that's 
right... if there are no bus folks, the job can take their incredibly 
generous offer and give it to someone who drives a h*nda or something.  &lt;grin&gt;

lots of vws around there- I know for a fact a dealer was selling them in 
Kenniwick, WA in late 54.  As it is desert, they dont rust either.  and 
you'll be on the dry side of the mountains but can come over to the wet side 
to see some greenness now and then.
