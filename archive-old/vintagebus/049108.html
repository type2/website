First and foremost, the exterior of the Westy is now painted!!!!!!!  Mango Green and Sea Gull Grey is on and looks tits!  I used (ummm, bought) Glasurit paint.  That's stuff goes on nice.  Front interior cab is supposedly being painted next week.  I might have this bus home by Thanksgiving yet.

Wow.  I'm sanded out.  To refresh memories, my '59 Westfalia's previous owner make the brilliant decision to paint all of the cabinets green sometime back in the early '70's.  Maybe it helped to preserve the wood, but it sure was a PITA to remove.  Not only did I need to remove the green paint, but also the old laquer finish to insure that I get a consistent color when I reapply the new polyurethane.

I got the bulk of the crap off last Summer/Fall, then took a break from the action up until about a month ago.  Over the past 4 weeks I've sanded all of the cabinetry with either 120 or 150 grit sandpaper (depending on what was needed) and then 220.  After the sanding I needed to replace several pieces of the *reddish/brown* edge trim that is found on the inside edges of the cabinet door openings and also on the exterior edges of the cabinets.  I was fortunate to find a mahogany wood tape that was almost an identical match to the original.  It required cutting strips the proper width and length, then the stuff is applied using a special ( special cuz it's small) iron that melts the adhesive backing of the wood tape.  It came out awesome.  I even did the entire closet door opening as it was frayed all over, so it was easier to just scrape of the old and reapply one long, new piece. 

The most recent challenge was to replace the same *reddish/brown* trim that is found along the top edge of the two camper area/cargo seat bases.  These are almost always chipped to hell for obvious reasons of 40 years of use.  The tough part is this edging is a hair over 1 3/8&quot; (metric no doubt) and is almost impossible to find in that width, as opposed to the 9/16&quot; wide stuff on the door openings which you can find at any lumber yard/home improvement store.  I even went to Home Depot and no luck.  I tried taking a piece of veneer and cuting it to the proper width/length and staining it the right color, but the grain is way off.  So, after days of searching I was able to order some 2&quot; wide tape that is the exact same mahogany stuff as the narrower tape I used on the cabinets.  It's bitchin!  I'll get those pieces applied over the next couple of days and then it's polyurethane time!

If any SO-23 owners out there feel like taking their interior resto to the ridiculous levels that I am, I have plenty of this wide wood tape.  Pmail me if you need some, I had to buy 250 feet to get the 12' I needed.  Oiy!

Robert
