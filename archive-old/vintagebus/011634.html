Subject: Change the stats! =)

Whoo hoo! I sold the overtly marketed 88 Buick from the only call that I had
on the first day of the ad. Now I am (literally) sweating to get the '63 VW
on the road prior to Monday. It all should go relatively well. I was afraid
that I would loose my shorts in that GM thing. Did Ok. 
The buyer literally choked on coffee or something when I told him why I was
selling a perfectly running super low mileage modern mobile. I responded
that I had the oppty to snag a rare antique car and could only afford it or
the Buick. He interjected that he hoped that it wasnt &quot;an old BMW.&quot; I
replied that it was better yet,- A 1954 VW bus. He then choked and took
about 30 secs to recover. Oh well... =)
