Subject: Re: [VB] Accelerator pedal linkage question

&gt; 
&gt; The problem now is that sometimes the L bracket can catch on the lip
&gt; of the vertical support that the U bracket is welded to.  There is
&gt; maybe 1.5 cm of space between the legs of the U and the L bracket is
&gt; free to slide back and forth in this whole space.  If I push the L
&gt; bracket inboard, and pull the linkage down (like stepping on the
&gt; pedal), I can make it catch at about 1/2 throttle.  If I go up in
&gt; the cab and step on the pedal a couple of times, it sticks again the
&gt; first time or two and then frees itself.
&gt; 
&gt; I have all the pieces shown in the parts manual and the L bracket
&gt; still has its attached washer at the pivot point.  The L bracket is
&gt; maybe 3 mm thick and the washer adds another 2 mm or so at the pivot.
&gt; It wouldn't really help if the washer was thicker, as that would tend
&gt; to move the L bracket inboard, which is the wrong direction.  It
&gt; almost seems like I need a 5 mm or so spacer (thick washer) inboard
&gt; of the L bracket to keep it from catching on the frame rail.  Another
&gt; possibility is that the pivot pin or the L bracket hole is worn too
&gt; much, which lets the L bracket get less than perpendicular to the
&gt; pivot pin.  They don't look too bad, but maybe it's enough to cause
&gt; a problem.
&gt; 
&gt; I haven't tried it on the road yet but this potential problem has me
&gt; concerned.  I don't have a column lock so I could just kill the
&gt; ignition if it sticks on me, but I'd rather not have to go there in
&gt; the first place.
&gt; 
&gt; Anybody else ever run into this?  Any tips or suggested fixes?
&gt; Thanks!


Hi Matt,

I had the exact same problemo and went thru the same steps as you!  Finally
solved the problem when I noticed that the angle of the gas pedal was not
the proper angle to the vertical heater tube as in other buses that didn't
have the problem!  Somehow the pedal hinges which are spot welded to the
floor got bent and threw the proper angle for the accelerator rod out of
whack which made everything below stick at times.  Try and slightly twist
the pedal to be angled more towards the heater tube than away from it (if it
is)and see if that helps.

BTW the my bent pedal hinges eventually broke off from metal fatigue from
over bending back &amp; forth so avoid bending it too much or plan on changing
out the whole pedal hinge in the future!!
