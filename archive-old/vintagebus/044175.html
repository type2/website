Howdy Y'all!
Yep, me again.  I'm afraid I may have gotten things really screwed on my 66 camper.  I have been having a recurring problem holding an idle.  I can adjust when it's cold to hold, then when the engine heats up, it no longer holds the idle.  I adjust when its warm to where it holds, then when the engine cools down, you get the picture.  Anyway I have been adjusting what I thought was the idle air screw (per Muir) little screw behind the carb plug.  And now I've got really acrid black smoke coming out the exhaust.  VERY Fume-y black smoke, and nothing I do seems to help.  Now, it won't hold an idle and I've got this smoke that burns your eyes if your in garage.  I have replaced points, condenser, have static timed it as best as I could.  Please HELP!!  What have I done???  I am also thinking this camper may have a beetle engine in it, the engine code is &quot;AE 670527&quot;.  Can anyone confirm or deny this engine type is beetle???
