Hi Sam,

But are these LT tires?  Are they 6 ply?  Anything that is 1/2 the price --
sounds like passenger tires (4 ply) to me.  What is the max PSI, 35 or 50?

Which raises the issue of Splits:  especially the older 3/4 TON models as
opposed to later models that are 1 TON.

There may be 15&quot; tires out there that have the load capacity but not the
stronger sidewall.  It would seem that we don't have the double whammy
issues of the 14&quot; VW tire users... 

Especially on the late loaf westy, there are few tires out there in proper
size at 14&quot; that can carry full load.  On my '71 Loaf I have 195/75/14 and
they are 6 ply but not near the load capacity.

In other words -- passenger tires or &quot;non 6 ply truck tires&quot; may actually be
able to carry the load on a 15&quot;.  But as David Raistrick pointed out -- for
those of us spending more $ to deal with driving in cross winds (or being
passed by large trucks), we need the 50PSI tires.  A Honda SUV may hold up
with 4 ply tires, but are those things square and take wind like our beloved
VW bus?

My experience is that you pay $10 to $40 more to get stiffer 50 PSI tires.

205/75/15  Cornell is the label on the  tyres that I out on the back of my
63
singlecab.  They were from Pep Boys and I think cost almost 1/2 of what you
paid.  Check out Pep Boys for 15&quot; tyres.  They seem to be just fine but I
have
yet to do a RPM check to fin out what rpm's per mph.  Still complicated by
the
fact that I have 165R15's on the front.

They have a max load of 1600 lbs. So I do not I will have a load problem.
