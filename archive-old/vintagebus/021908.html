Thom writ:
&gt;In all honestly, the 901/915 trannies suck. They're way too fragile for the
application, but people just accept it. The serious porsche people upgrade
to the G50 anyway. My bus tranny shifts much nicer than my 911 tranny, and
it's just an off-the-shelf production rebuild. &lt;

100% agree Thom!!!

915s suck.  901 suck worse.  G50 is the only way to go, but is expensive
also at about $2000 for one out of the junkyard...  Excuse me since it is
Porsche they call it a &quot;dismantler&quot;.  

Also the gearing is all wrong for the bus... Who wants to go 140-150MPH in a
bus?  I have not seen a Brembo brake upgrade for the bus yet. LOL !   Also
consider fan speed at highway speeds.  The engine must be turning over
3000RPM to generate enough air volume to keep it cool under highway load, if
this gets changed you may fry an engine or have odd over-heat problems.

Now here you have two &quot;educated&quot; opinions on the 911 tranny swap who agree
that it is not a good general idea.  End of discussion ;)
