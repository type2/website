hi everybody!
i just saw a sneak preview of &quot;Almost Heroes&quot; last night. and i gotta tell
ya', i've never seen so many buses in a movie before. there were 13 windows
strolling all over the place, a couple DC's, a single cab or two, they even
had buses parked next to eachother in a parking lot. it takes place in
california in 1973, so there were some bay windows too. did anyone's buses
star in this movie?
