Is that because Oregon uses a lot of left hand pump nozzles and most
Oregonians are right handed so they hire all the left handed people to
pump the gas for you righties?  Or what?  Why is that?  
It's the only thing I hate about Oregon...having to allow some pump jockey
scratch the paint and overfill the gas onto everything...afterall....I'm
the one who is supposed to do that!
