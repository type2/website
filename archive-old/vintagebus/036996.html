Hi Volks,
This in our two 63 SCs results in one line of rivets from side to side on the 
beds being drilled and riveted into a square reinforcement tube spot welded 
under the bed in the top of the tool bay!  Making at least in the SCs of 
55-67 manufacture not possible for installing hidden rivets from underneath, 
and all the factory photos show either the screw or rivet heads showing in 
the bed.  This line of rivets results in water leaking into this tubing and 
rusting it from the inside out. and it looks like this tubing will drain 
water into other reinforcement tubing around the tool bay door/s.  We are 
looking at drilling new holes after welding up the old ones and moving this 
one line of rivets (Or prehaps we will use bolts and nuts.) a few inches 
forward or backwards to avoid secret leakage into this tubing!   Eric&amp;Barb
