 Excess play in the drag link end at the steering box is bad,
 whether it is rotational or axial. You need a new one.

 &gt; &gt; Last question now - I disconnected the link that goes from the steering
box
 &gt; &gt; to the swivel pin at the swivel pin end.   However the link has a lot
of
 &gt; &gt; side to side movement - I can push it into and pull out from the
steering
 &gt; &gt; box quite a distance - is this normal?
 &gt;
 &gt; Hmm, not sure what you are talking about there.  You might want to look
at
 &gt; the bus parts manual on the Obsolete AC Documents website for proper
 &gt; nomenclature.
