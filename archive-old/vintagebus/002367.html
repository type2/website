Subject: Converting 6 volt to 12 volt
Date: Mon, 28 May 2001 21:06:38 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I have a 1966 Westfalia which is currently undergoing a transmission rebuild
and an engine replacement. The engine that I have to install is a 12 volt
engine from a 1971 Karmann Ghia. I think that this might be an appropriate
time to convert from the standard 6 volt system to a 12 volt system. What
unexpected problems have others encountered doing this and is this a
worthwhile change?
As far as I know I'll have to change all the bulbs, get a 12 volt voltage
regulator, a 12 volt starter, a &quot;6 to 12 volt&quot; starter bushing, a 12 volt
battery and a voltage drop for the 6 volt wiper motor.
I'm also concerned that I'll need to change throwout bearing forks to
accomodate the newer clutch assembly, is that true?
How much and where do I need to grind the bellhousing to accomodate the
larger flywheel?
Any help the list can provide will be appreciated. Camping season is here
and I'm anxious to get back on the road.
