Ah yes - the most common brake fallacy - &quot;bigger is always better&quot;

Bigger *is* better, to a point, but beyond that you're just in it
for the hardware.  You can put Big Reds on there, but if you don't 
have the tires hold it, you're 'braking' in the wind.  

If you can lock the wheels with stock brakes and tires, bigger brakes
won't help.  That is, unless you'e tracking your bus!
