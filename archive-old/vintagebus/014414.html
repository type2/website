Oh Powerful list:


As many of you know. Volkswagen made the Bug in Brasil for many years with 
some unusual features that were different from the German or Mexican Bugs of 
the same year.

Here is what I would like to do. I would like to get some Brasilian Vent 
window assembleis to install in my 57 Baja. All of the Brasilian Bugs had 
the smaller windows like 58 to 64 Bugs had. They had vent windows that used 
late style latches but were the size of 64 and older Bugs.  Being a Baja, it 
does not have to look original, just functional.

Does anyone know of any connections in Brasil to get these unique items. I 
know that Bus nose sections and other Genuine VW parts are being brought 
into the U.S. by someone. But who?

Skid.
