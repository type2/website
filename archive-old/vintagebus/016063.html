And it was written:
...and if the &quot;barndoor&quot; in question is a singlecab or
ambulance, than it doesn't even have the large engine
lid that we all describe as barndoor! Maybe we should
be REALLY geeky and come up with a new term for
Barndoor buses? Any suggestions?

Hmmm... How about getting really wild and refering to
these vehicles as pre-3/55 transporters? ;-)
On the other hand, buses of this vintage all have big
round holes along both vertical sides of the deck lids
regardless of the size. Maybe we could refer to them
as holey &lt;sic&gt; buses. Pre 3/55 Deluxes would be the
holy of the holey...

BTW: Paula and I refer to the '54 bus as the &quot;Dad&quot; bus
in honor of John Jacobsen, previous owner of the bus.
Other than that I refer to it as my &quot;Popeye&quot; bus.
I yam what I yam, I'm Popeye da sailor main! Ah caw,
caw, caw! Toot! toot!
