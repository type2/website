i just got a new battery for my bus over lunch (the biggest, baddest battery
i could find). i was also looking for a power inverter for my space heater.
while doing so, i ran across this 12v wall outlet. what you're supposed to
do is mount it wherever your little heart desires, hook the positive up to
one of your 15 amp fuses, and the ground wire up to the body. now to the
questions:

Do you guys think this setup will work?

If it does, do you think it will power a space heater?

Is it safe?

Where's the best place to hook up the ground wire?

Please keep in mind that i'm a novice in the field of wiring.

thanks for all your help!
