&lt;&lt; How much play should there be and how do you measure it?&gt;&gt;
Hi Michael,
Take off the belly pan.  Slide under and grab the push rod.  If the rod does 
not wiggle side to side at all then there is no play.  Loosen lock nut and 
adjust rod until there is some wiggle.

&lt;&lt;Is the amount of travel on the brake pedal before it meets resistance what 
I need to measure? &gt;&gt;  
To measure the play.  Slide under the bus again, this time with a 6&quot; ruler 
and grab the brake pedal below the floor and wiggle the push rod at the same 
time.  Then pull down on the brake pedal and at the same time wiggling the 
push rod side to side at the same time.  When the brake rod stops being able 
to be wiggled pick up the ruler and measure a spot on the brake pedal arm or 
the push rod.  Then release the brake arm and measure where the spot you 
measured before has ended up.  This should be about 1/32&quot; or 1mm.
If your brake system is in good shape nad greased well you should be able to 
sense this play by moving the assembly by hand and noting the slight space by 
feel.  But for the first time especially try the former first.    Eric&amp;Barb
