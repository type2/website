Subject: pop out seal replacement

Decided the replace the seal of the left window pop out on my 61 15 window yesterday.  slowly been replacing seals here and there.  the deal is the new pop out seals that go on the outside of the frame don't have molded edges, and are very hard to open/close when new, and I won't open it all winter.  hopefully it'll be molded in a bit by when the warm weather comes. then I'll want to be able to open &amp; close it.

1st, removed the pop out window, the 5 small screws and the two pop out to frame screws.  This was really easy.  I had replaced the old frame with a good one in 96, and greased the threads of the screws.   used an oem VW tool screwdriver, which fits the slotted screws properly, and all came out nicely.  Your experience may differ.  Put them carefully in a magnetic tray so as to not lose the tiny things.  Cleaned the opening in the bus, there were a couple tiny rust bubbles that I ignored, nothing major.  

The right side pop out body area has exposed rust like an unhealed wound, and will have to have that dealt with when putting a new seal on, but one thing at a time.

Took the frame to the work bench and with a razor knife cut the outer frame seal.   managed to pull it out of the frame w/o cutting all the way around.   dried off the water thathad seeped between frame and seal, but nicely unrusted.  sprayed liquid wrenched and squirted oil in the channel, and making sur ethe seal pointed the correct way, fit it in all the way around, working it into place with a screwdriver.

it's a 2 person job to install the frame w/ new seal, as you have to push the frame so the screw holes line up with the holes in the hinge.  attached the frame to latch screws first, and took someone on the list's hint of using talcum powder on the seal where it'll touch the body.  ended up using a piece of wood as a lever to pry the frame forward to line them up.  also had to pry the seal so the frame wood fit, with a piece of plastic (didn't want to scrape through the paint w/ metal.  used a hairdryer to warm up the seal to make it more flexible this was really fussy and annoying.  eventually got it all lined up and screwed all 5 screws in.  

 pushed the window all the way closed with splayed fingers.  (sigla glass, easy to break).  realised the pop out was adjusted to tight, opened it (good tip on the talcum powder) and set the latch screws so they adjusted it at the loosest.  looks like it seals up nice.

yup, didn't take the frame apart and replace the inner seal, still used the old outer seal, just replaced the one on the outside of the frame.  Don't want water puddling under there, rusting things out.
