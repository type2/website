&gt; For those who has the Hoover CD, there is an essay on an absolutely ingenious
&gt; way to protect your bus that can only be easily be installed on a bus due to
&gt; its clutch and brake petal geometry, at least I THINK it's on the CD.  The
&gt; other two ways (mentioned below after this post) are pretty good, but I
&gt; guarantee that for someone trying to rip off your bus with this gadget
&gt; installed (only for busses with a front splash pan, BTW..) they will go home
&gt; crying and frustrated.  It involves disabling either the clutch (recommended)
&gt; or brake petal so that they can't pull it back up.  Its unconventionality will
&gt; absolutely stump any would-be thief because they are used to looking only for
&gt; the common things to do to a vehicle to steal it.  Most wouldn't have a clue
&gt; as to where to start to &quot;fix&quot; the bus to get it rolling again.  And if they
&gt; did, it would take them a while and they would be lying on the ground under
&gt; the bus to do the fixing - not the kind of envorinment thieves like, what with
&gt; all of the people walking by asking if &quot;everything is alright&quot; or &quot;can I call
&gt; the police or a wrecker for you&quot; going on.
