Hi Volks!
I'm just about to throw out inside panels that I took out of my bus..... as
much as I could I took little silver trim pieces off some panels....the ones
that were still straight. If anyone needs those to complete their original
interior let me know. They're free. Let me know if you need dimensions of
those pieces.

Peace,

Dre
