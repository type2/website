&gt; Commercial vessels, and quite a few pleasure cruisers, use a system
&gt; called a keel cooler.  In its simplest form it's just a couple of runs of
&gt; metal pipe/tubing lying lengthwise along the boat's bottom, just above
&gt; the keel, functioning as a heat exchanger.

I haven't been following the soobie thread until the last post or two...
so flame me if its old info... but Ken Madsen has a Subaru powered
Beastelwagen, or Kemperink. 

Also:
We have a 75 Type2 in town with a mustang v-6, and the guy who built it
was something of an engineer.
He fixed up a rear mount radiator that completely takes the place of the
decklid, and sectioned it off to draw fresh air from the stock bay vents
up high, but not off the engine. He enarged the access from the top of
the engine in the passenger cpompartment.  He also used the side windows
at the rear, further enlarging the vents there ( with some unfortunate
pop-rivet body work) and then a set of Eorovan-style twin electric fans
blowing air across the radiator.  
With some tastefull grating at the outside, from a distance this set-up 
is nearly unnoticed by all but the most discerning eye. Looks like he
just has a black deck-lid.

The fellow unfortunately just passed away, and his family are selling
the bus for $2200. Inside is a shell. Runs like a ford. Clean body.
Corvallis, Oregon. Email me if you need more details...
