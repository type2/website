&gt;&gt;                      buses behind a barn                          5/23/99
&gt;Second one was a camper, no pop up, but had crank out windows,again with
&gt;lots of crap inside. (why do they do that).  It did however have the tent,
&gt;slightly lived in by mice, and what looked like to be lots of polls, I
&gt;assume for the tent
&gt;
Sounds a lot like my '66 Sundial!!!   Does the tent slide through a runner
above the cargo doors?  Big tent...takes up a whole 'nother parking place
next to the bus with 3 sides that zip together and completely enclose???  I
am missing the original poles fo my tent...pvc sucks!  I hate to
canabalize....but if the owner would be willing to part with the poles alone
you could make me a very happy woman!   I hope you would find out for me and
let me know...I would REEEEAAALLY appreciate it.  Or if anyone else knows
where I could  get those poles I would really appreciate the info.  Thanx!
