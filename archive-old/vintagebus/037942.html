&lt;&lt; Hi list,
 
 Can anyone clue me in to what is involved in swapping a split transmission
 for a tunnel one?
  &gt;&gt;
what are you swapping it for?

are you installing it in a bus that was originally a split case bus?

If you there are some attachment pieces by the nose cone it needs that would 
have been unused after the tunnel case install  A big round rubber bushing 
that goes around the nose cone in a circle at the rear torsion tube, and a c 
shaped bracket to help bolt thing in there.  Something else?  it's been a 
while since a did splitcase tranny swap.

The other thing I found is it is much nicer to use the sandwich style shift 
coupler than the newer more sturdy style with the metal reinforcements.  
Cause the way the trans attaches has less rubber mount bits, and the 
vibrations can be loud.   Split case buses are harder to change the shift 
coupler on than the May 20 59 through early 66 buses. cause of the linkage, 
so tranny out is the easiest time. 

does this help answer you question?
