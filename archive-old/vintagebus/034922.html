How does one describe the difference between
a crafted truck, such as a crewcab Binz, that
was produced by a company other than the
original vehicle manufacturer, from the same
vehicle crafted years after the vehicle was
originally produced?

er - do you mean the difference between a DCBinz that Binz made in 58 from a 
58 SC, from a Binz made in 64 from a 58?  Or do you mean the differene 
between a DC Binz made of a brand new SC    and   a DC someone else made from 
a VW SC?   er- well you can call it a DC made by Binz (or if there are other 
people who did this credit them) .   And I am sure if some one other than 
Binz made DCs (not impssible) they would do things somewhat differently than 
Binz did, so you could describe the differences.  I am not familiar enough 
with the Binzes to say what all changes they did exactly, or if the earlier 
Binzes were changed differently that the later Binzes.   Or do you mean what 
are the differences?   and how do you tell if it was made from a new truck or 
a used one?   Well, people have said their Binzes have primer engine 
compartments, thats one way.   I would expect that the Binz serial number 
were given out pretty much sequentially, so if this alleged BD Binz was made 
into a DC from new, it should have a very low Binz #.  If it was made later, 
it would have a later number than Binz of a later year that were converted by 
Binz earlier.     Hm- I am not sure what you were asking but it's fun the 
think about.

How would one 'label' a true '54 Binz from
one that ronnie crafted from a '54?
;;;;;;;;;;;;
well, it could be a Feitelson  DC?    it would probably have 4wheel anti lock 
disc brakes, and be automatic with a 2litre motor.   I have seen a number of 
buses made into SCs, though, and they are generally referred to as 'hacked 
into a truck' or 'homemade truck' so that might be what it is called.     
Like there are a number of shortened buses, what do you called them?
