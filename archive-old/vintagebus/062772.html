ok. i sold a bus a little while ago- that's some money there. i have a 
great JOB where i SAVE MONEY  (and a super cool &quot;boss&quot;) because i know 
every summer i go on road trips. i sell parts at the shows i go to while on
the 
road. i hit junkyards to support that part of it. i also sell off some of
the 
parts i find on the trip when i get home to recoup some of the money.
usually i 
recover enough money that the trip is almost free, sometimes i make way more

money than i spend. hey, if i can sell beetle parts to support my bus
habits, 
more power to me. i also find parts for people and shops who will reimburse
me 
for the parts, my time and/or efforts. AND i pay my bills before i leave so
i 
don't get back to a pile of debt.

food is cheap, and gas is alot cheaper anywhere once i get out of 
california.

i'm definitely not a trust fund kid, and i don't have a credit card 
either.

I've always wondered: the people who take these epic road trips -

how do they support themselves while on the road for weeks at a 

time?  I have a decent job (for now!) myself, but I can't 
imagine

taking 6 weeks off to go fart around the country in a bus without

pay.  

 

The money for all that gas and oil and food and parts, etc has to 

come from *somewhere*.  Do they just hit a liquor store in 
each

town they pass thru?  Rich uncle?  Sugar 
momma?  Parts whoring?
