Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Oil light flickers on new rebuild.

Thanks guys.
Clara mentions something that had me wondering yesterday. When I pulled the
oil pressure control valve yesterday a LOT of oil came out. Best guess about
1.5 quarts. I never remembered that happening before but I did have the back
of the bus jacked up a bit to get under her a little easier and the bus was
pointing down hill very slightly. I attributed it to the engine angle but
(grasping at straws) could this mean anything else??

I am comfortable with the gauge readings as they were reproducible from
mechanical gauge to electric sender. It is the dual sender and the light
came on at around 3-5 psi.

Clara, I must admit I did nothing about checking the pump as it was brand
new as was the cover. I will not make that mistake again. I figure I can
support the engine, remove the rear carrier to get to the pump for removal
and inspection without pulling the engine again. Is this correct?

Kris mentioned using a Berg 30 mm oil pump with the pressure relief cover on
this puppy. What are the listee's thoughts about this? What does this cover
look like and will it fit in front of the rear carrier?

In retrospect I am wondering about main bearing #3. To me it *felt* a little
sloppy and I even questioned it and was assured that it miced within spec
before installation. What would I know, as I have never seen a dry main on a
crank in my life. What should it *feel* like? This is the same shop that
pressed on the wrong gear to begin with.

Thanks!

&gt; Try a dial type oil pressure guage.   I had started getting low oil
pressure
&gt; and light flickering in my 65 (motor now in 61) a couple years ago and it
&gt; freaked me out as I was in Arizona.   Turned out the sender was bad- the
&gt; reading on the non electric dial guage was way higher than the guage
&gt; installed in bus.  Bought new sender, light stopped flickering at me.  It
was
&gt; dated 77- I had pulled that sender of a motor somewhere.  Just a thought.
&gt;
&gt; What was the play in the oil pump when you installed it?  You put the
feeler
&gt; guage between the teetch of the gears in there and measured right?  the
spec
&gt; is i think .008 &quot;, new should be .004&quot;  might have the number wrong, it is
in
&gt; the bentley etc.
&gt;
&gt; You dont actually have to drain oil to mess with oil pressure springs.   a
&gt; bit will drip out when you pull the plug, but maybe 1/8 cup if that.

&gt; &lt;&lt;  wonder how many listees push delete when they see my address.
&gt;
&gt;  Thanks for the replies. I tried to respond to each or to the list.
&gt;
&gt;  Anyway,
&gt;  Today I put in a mechanical pressure gauge and at start up the pressure
was
&gt;  50 psi. I put in the electric sender and mounted the gauge up front. The
&gt;  pressure on the gauge agreed at start up and took for a drive. By the
time I
&gt;  got to about 200 degrees the pressure was more like 20 psi and at idle of
&gt;  around 900 rpm (a guess), down to 4-5 psi, and the light was flickering
&gt;  again.
&gt;
&gt;  Flaps was sold out of new oil pressure springs until next week so for
grins
&gt;  I shimmed them .120 inch and repeated the test drive. I put 40w oil in
again
&gt;  as I did not want to change two things at once. Same sorry results. The
oil
&gt;  pump is new and if it was faulty, would I have great startup pressures?
&gt;
&gt;  When I rebuilt this puppy everything that could me micced was, and
&gt;  plastigauge used where it could be used. I had to trust the machine shop
on
&gt;  # 3 main as was put on before I got it back from them.
&gt;
&gt;  When this case was last running in the 71DP, it ran hot but I never had
any
&gt;  &quot;oil light on&quot; indication of poor pressure.
&gt;
&gt;  Other notes: The oil does not smell like gas.
&gt;  I think the vibrations may be a combination of factors as is not
&gt;  reproducible when the bus is not rolling. May have to get worse then be
&gt;  obvious??
&gt;
&gt;  Any more thoughts?
&gt;   &gt;&gt;
