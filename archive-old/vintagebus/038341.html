That is just the way I got it.  In fact those pics are the ones the PO
emailed me.  He made the dolly for it.  I left it on that dolly and rolled
it onto a trailer when I towed it home, but that was only 60 miles or so.
Now I'm going &gt; 1100 miles and would rather have wheels &amp; tires under it.

It was a father son project where they lost interest after taking it that
far (They worked on it on &amp; off for 4 years doing all the body, electrical &amp;
front end....then the son moved out and the father had a Porsche he was
waiting to restore).  I have all the doors &amp; gates but they still need
paint.  The new job will actually give me more time to work on it.  Figure I
should be ready by spring.

The only major things it needs are over riders for the bumpers, tilt &amp; bows,
and bed slats.  I'll start hunter for those in December after we get settled
in.

&gt; I have a '60 SC I bought pretty much as you see at www.wyricks_dot_com/vw .
It
&gt; was too easy to stay in Southern California and finish the restoration.
