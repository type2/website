Subject: Re: [VB]gasoline /  No Response - 2nd Try: Help Tuning My Bus

the liquid gasoline itself does expand/ contract significantly.  I was 
confused by gas smells when parked a couple times on a recent road trip... it had 
been over 60 miles after a fill up, when on a slight slope.. and about 80 miles 
after, parked on the flat.   I think it was gas expansion....   but I'm 
guessing here,   but there were sig temp &amp; elevation changes.   I gues I could have 
pulled the gas cap and see if it came out, but I didn't

    It is frequent for people to complain of gas smells when they park real 
soon after a fill up, esp when parked with the fill pipe on a downhill slant... 
the gas expands and then oozes out the breather holes in the cap (the cap 
must be vented so the tank doesn't suction in).  

Liquid water doesn't expand/ contract much at all between freezing and 
boiling, but different substances have dif properties.

  Could fill a graduated container to a certain level, attach empty plastic 
bag on top w/ rubber bands to keep the gas from evaporating away, set to warm 
up, and come back later and see how the level has changed.   or even look it up 
in a book somewhere.  :)

does the gasoline exapand/contract or does the vapor pressure of the 
gasoline increase -- i.e. the gas evaporates at higher temperatures and 
the a sealed container it's in expands because of the pressure exerted by 
the gas...
