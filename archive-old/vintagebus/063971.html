Subject: Several Salvage Safari Seals Suspiciously Seep

With some research from Karl, I found acceptable safari seal in the form of
Volvo trunk seals. Actually I installed some cut down side window seals from a
Dodge minivan that has a cross section like dUD, where the U fits over the
windshield opening and the D part presses against the safari window frames. I
sliced the d part off before I found that Volvo trunk seals are the perfect UD
cross section. Never mind the vent holes in D portion, they'll be inside the
bus.
 Both have a metal spring in the U part and fit into the corners pretty well.
Trim a bit around the hinge and latch bases, put the seam at the top and you
have cheap replacements that leak just like the originals that cost ~$80/pair.
My window openings are misshapen, so they may work better on yours.
I used the butyl rubber putty like tape called dum-dum or firewall sealant to
leak-proof them from the outside. Our rainy season coincides with our
cool/cold season and it held well last year.  If you can't get to a salvage
yard and can tolerate my procrastination let me know and I'll grab some for
you.
