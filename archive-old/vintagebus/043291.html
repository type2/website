&gt; The pedal went to the floor without the
&gt; normal resistance but still would spring back up but with no clutch action.

Sometimes you'll get this if just a strand or two breaks, and sometimes
it's not clear that this is the case unless you remove the cable.  I'd
check that before pulling the engine.

&gt; I have not pulled the engine yet
&gt; to take a look at it.
&gt; What is involved with this repair?
&gt; Does this part have to pressed in?

Nope.  Basically: remove engine, remove lock bolt and spring &amp; pieces from
outside the clutch housing, cross shaft slides out.  Good time to replace
cross shaft bushings if suspect (getting the right one out can be a pain)
and possibly even the clutch components, gland nut bearing, and front
engine &amp; input shaft oil seals -- all are accessible w/engine out. 

I just did this in my 71 recently - one of the arms that holds the release
bearing came off (weld gave way).  Replacement was much heavier duty, with
the arms encircling the cross shaft, not just welded to the bottom.

But check that cable first.
