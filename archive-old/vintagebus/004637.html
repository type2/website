In light of Dave Easterwood's announcement, I can find no reasonable
justification for not attending the Classic. If you live in Northern
California, Oregon or Washington and are  planning to attend, let me know.
Perhaps we can arrange a convoy for mutual protection and enjoyment. I will
be driving down on Friday, meeting up with Harry Houck from Fresno. Bring
your tools, spare parts, and a desire to travel slowly and expectantly. I
will have to rein Rosie in, but what the hell, half the fun is getting
there.

Re: Identification, I will be wearing my (now) old purple Type 2 list tee
shirt. I knew I should have ordered some new ones from Richard.

Live fast, die young, leave a good looking corpse.
Oops, too late!
