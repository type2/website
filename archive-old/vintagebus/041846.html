&gt; &lt;&lt; I really hate to spend $30 or so every couple of years
&gt;  to replace wiper blades just so I can see where I am
&gt;  going when it is raining, especially when I may only
&gt;  need them a couple of times in the life of the blades. &gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Well Jim, your sposed to change your blades yearly, so the way I see it your 
&gt; still getting by on the cheap.

Well, they unhook very easily from the arms.  For daily driving I leave
the blade assembly in the bus out of the sun.  I put a small plastic cap
on the arm to prevent scratching if the wipers are accidently turned on.
If the weather's threatening I snap 'em on!
