Okay,

So we have the general concensus that some good repro parts are needed in this
area.  No offense, but I don't think any one person on this list has the
resources (read C A S H) to correctly repro these.  I realize that Bus Boys,
Wolfgang, and ECM (?) have attempted this without making anything near the
original quality, at least as far as I have seen.

Maybe we should think about this from a different angle.  Someone mentioned
that we should make them without frames at all?  Is this feasible?  I'm not an
engineer or anything, but that sounds like the best approach so far.

When I worked at SCAT in the early 90s, we imported brand new Double Cabs from
Brazil.  These, as some of you know, are a combination of split and bay window
buses.  Anyway, the side popout windows were just glass with 4 holes, 2 in each
end.  2 for the hinge and 2 for the, albeit different, latch.

Okay, now the flames will fly.  I know that you hard core purists may not like
it, but let's take a look and see.  We didn't import many of those Brazilian
Double Cabs, but the customers sure didn't complain about the windows leaking.

Just for the record, they used a pinchwelt with a bulb on the side seal,
similar to the seal used on Westy poptops.
