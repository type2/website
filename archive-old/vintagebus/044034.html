What in the heck is the metal channel for on the '60s Busses that is
attatched to the inner sheet metal in the engine compartment, on the
drivers side, just forward of the air vents?  It runs from top to bottom.
It's in a weird place and seems as tho a rubber seal or something might
slip into it?
The question was posed by a friend of mine, and up until he pointed it
out...I had never given it any attention before.
If you don't know what I mean...check yours out and see if something is
sitting in place there or is it just this empty metal channel sitting
there.
Thanks
