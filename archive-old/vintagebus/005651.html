 Just talked to Rich K. and asked about Classic swap spots. Will be $55 per
spot (15x15) in advance and $65 at the gate. Show admission will still be
$15 per person per bus or bug. If I do sell it will be at the OCTO show ,
not the Classic. To expensive for me. The VW Classic is now produced/owned
by Bob Hole and group from Sacromento. Hope it stays as Rich made it. Will
be there as a show bus, not swapper.
