&gt; One suggestion to help prevent some of the problems happening...find one

&gt; people the same question - confusion arises. Keep it simple, if you want
&gt; answers that matter-always ask to speak with the same person. I don't know
&gt; who is more competent-the father or his son, but just pick one. And stik

Nice thought Kev, but these guys are just sheisters. She needs to get the
bus back ASAP, and do some research and reading.
