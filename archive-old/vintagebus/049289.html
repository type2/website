We all have experienced this dilema, I'm sure.  To some folks it probably goes unnoticed.  To other anal people, like myself and Greg Noble, it keeps us up at night and our minds in a constant state of flux.  It's the problem that occurs with the seal that goes between the front window frame assembly and the top of the door.

You know what I'm talking about, that little hump that occurs in the seal at the bend in the door, just at the trailing edge of the front vent window.  Now most people leave it there, or cut it so that it lies down flat.  But you'll notice og seals lie flat without cutting it.  What's the solution to this?  (besides trying to locate NOS seals).

1. Cut it and remove a small piece, then adhesive it back together?  Problem with that is it will look crappy.

2. Hope that it flattens over time?  Yeah, right.

3. Somehow cut a wedge out of the seal underneath that won't show as it will be covered by the window assembly?  Afterall it does occur where the second *leg* of the frame slides down into the door.

4. Epoxy the *humped* portion down to the door itself?  I'm afraid it will just pop back up.

Anyone have a secret trick on this????

TIA.

Robert
