Subject: Paint codes

List members;

I'm about to repaint the doublecab&amp; if someone could provide me with the code 
# for dove blue.
I want to use a twostage system, any thoughts on this [Pro or Con]

I planned on replacing the gates (this is the 1960 early truck) with the 
later year style, {full size extrusions) I bought a set last year, but I have 
decided to use the ones with the truck. So I've a set of good gates to sell 
P-Mail if any interest.

We are moving from Washington to Oreegon&amp; getting the truck finished will be 
a squeeze in time.
