Subject: [VB] sundial curtain springs...


hi all,

I think at one point my 61 standard was a sundial as it has the holes and
screws for the curtian springs all over, i just dont have the springs.

I have a set of westy rods, but dont really want to drill 14 more holes in
my bus so i'd rather use the holes that are already there for some
springs...

Anyone know a good source to get these springs? i wanted to do this
tonight, but Home depot nor craftsman hardware has anything remotely
close. (if all else fails i'll use shock cord by the foot and put ends on
it...)

I think i'll try grainger, but if someone knows of a good place to look
i'd be most appreciative. I think like 1/8 spring by 15-16 inch length is
what i need? anyone have a measurement... Gettng the bus ready for 2 weeks
in NM and AZ, woohoo.

thanks,

Steve
