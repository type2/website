Subject: WR1- Starter Relay in 66?

Well I took the inaugural run in the 66 Westfalia from Wheaton Md to
Annapolis Md, 35 miles 85 degree weather. Realizing that the brakes will
need caring for I took my time getting through town and filled the van up
w/gas. Anyone know a good place to get a key for the gas latch (kinda looks
like an allen head?), the PO left it open for me.  After that it was off to
the beltway and I cruised at 55-60 no problem (No speedo Melanie my wife
followed and said thats what we were doing)!!!  Alos got stuck in beltway
traffic!  Stopped at my folks to show them the newest member of the VW
family but they were not home.  Went back out to start NO GO.  Didn't have a
hammer so i tried banging the starter with a big wrench but no go.  Went
back the next day and it started right up which I figured it would do.  So I
am going to install the WR1 relay, is it ok for a 6 volt starter?  Also on
my initial to do list is brakes.  I was going to order shoes for the front
and back, bleed and replace lines and order from a discount store like the
Bus Depot or should I inspect them individually first? They worked, just not
great!  Also needs the speedometer fixed, I have seen rebuilt one's
advertised, any suggestions for me to fix it myself.  It is going to be a
long process for me to get this bus up to snuff, I figure first the basic
mechnicals and then removing the interior and trying to stop the rust. The
previous PO put a bug bumper (chrome w/litle riders on it?) on the front
anyone looking for cool bug front bumper in the DC area so I can go get a
normal bumper! Is the jack from a 75 ok for using on a 66?

Thanks,

Patrick Flynn
