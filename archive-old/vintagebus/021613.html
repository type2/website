Subject: Re:  Re: [VB] do trucks require a different real bumper
To: swharris_at_earthlink_dot_net, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

for the 54-58 trucks there was a stamped rear bmper with squarer corners

for  trucks. there was a differnt rear bumper to Jan 1960

Jan 5, 1960, at ch 554 147, the rear bumper design as standardised.

----
so if the 60 truck in question is an early 60, yes it came with the truck 
only non stamper rear bumper.    But, the bus bumper will fit.
