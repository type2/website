There work is excellent.
My 61 panel is just being finished by them.
here's a link to see the work thats been done.
http://www.classicvws_dot_com/woody.htm
My bus will end up running about 10K .
And thats for everything but the brakes and 
motor which I've already done.15 to 20 for a 
Westy sounds right.probably be more like 20.
A 58 Westy is worth it in my opinion !!
And will take about 1 1/2 to 2 years ! Mine been there
1 year and 5 months.No problem as I knew this going into it.

    I just talked to Lenny (owner of WCC) and 
they are not taking in any more restoration for at about
6 months, until they can get caught up.He has about 20 cars
 now and wants to get that down to about 12 to 15.He's also
 thinking about only taking in the cars he wants to restore.
(ie. Hebs,Barndoors,Split Beetles etc...)
Hope this helps,
