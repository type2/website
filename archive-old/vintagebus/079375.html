&gt;&gt;&gt; So PLEASE, get one and keep it charged or you may as well not have one.
Any idea where I can get a fuel cut-off set-up?  &lt;&lt;

Hi Chris,
Good points!  Also make sure to carry at least a five Lbs. or bigger 
extinguisher.  Not the tiny baby bottle size kind.  Plus if the extinguisher is of the 
dry powder type it must be turned upside down once a month or the dry 
chemical will cake into a block inside the cylinder and not blow onto the fire!!!!!
