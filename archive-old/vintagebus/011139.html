Subject: Re: [VB] Deluxe Poptop Westy?

hm- my 65 westy, and a couple 66s and a 67 I had all had the dome light base 
with rectangular cover.  Have not really scoped out a 64 so 42.  Guess that 
was changed early 65ish then.  Funny how they change things at random 
intervals.  Curious about the date of your westy parts list, JP.

&gt; early so-42's (such as mine) came with clamshell's they then changed to the 
&gt; rectangular (and less attractive imho :) lights after that

&gt;  &gt; I thought clam shells were earlier than the so 42
&gt;  &gt; kit.  That so 42s and so 44s 
&gt;  &gt; had the rectangular light covers, that in cross
&gt;  &gt; section are a U
&gt;  &gt; 
&gt;  In the Westy parts catalog I have for SO-42's, the
&gt;  picture shows clamshells.  When (or if) my web site
&gt;  gets back up, I'll give you the url for that page.
