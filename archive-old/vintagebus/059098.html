Subject: Re: [VB] parcel tray slot

Yes, that's it! Thanks. Someday I will put the antenna in the right
place, and that will help. Sorry for the bad description, it was the
only keyhole slot I was thinking of, I guess there are some more to
attach the steering column bracket...

Hi Volks,
Just checked our 1960 panel camper conversion out in the light snow!
If it
is the large key hole that is about 1-1/2&quot; tall and center of the dash
parcel
tray it would be for the radio antennia cable to pass through.
