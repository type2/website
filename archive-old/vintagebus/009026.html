Rebuilt the driver's side front wheel cylinder on my '55 Bus this weekend.
A public thanks to David Easterwood for listing the NAPA part # 513 for
Barndoor Buses, found it in the archives.  The wheel cylinder cups on that
side were cracked and leaking as of Saturday morning.  I got to work and
noticed a small pool of brake fluid next to the tire, along with the whole
rim being covered with the stuff.  The brakes barely pulled to the right and
pedal travel was only slightly increased, so I decided to drive it home that
night.  Got it all apart Sunday a.m. and fortunately, the brake fluid
appeared to have just have run straight down the backing plate and then
sprayed everywhere from the spinning front wheels.  Cleaned everything up
with brake cleaner and rags and elbow grease and put it all back together.
Checked out the passenger side too and everything looked good there, except
the front axle locking tab was broken.  It was a little tight (washer could
not be moved with a screwdriver) but the wheel bearings were not damaged.
Had to trim the locking portion of the new locking washer to fit over the
axle, guess Barndoors have a shorter locking portion, perhaps prone to
breakage?

Repacked the wheel bearings, too, messy job.

Bled the brakes and no fluid would come out of the right rear cylinder.  I
took the bleeder valve completely out and stomped on the brake pedal, no
fluid.  The brakes still worked on that wheel, though.  That's weird, I
thought.  Decided to stick a tiny screwdriver into the hole to see if
something was blocking it.  Poked it in there and I heard a muted pop! and
fluid started coming out.  Strange...    Bled everything and adjusted the
shoes and everything was nice and tight.  Installed the NOS bleeder valve
dust boots that I got from Wolfsburg West.

Cleaned up my crappy temporary chrome rims, too.  Coker Tire messed up my
Bias ply tire shipment out to California so I'm stuck with radials until the
end of the year.  Doh!

Later,
