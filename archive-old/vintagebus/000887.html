&gt;By the way I work in the lab for a custom color company making colors for
&gt;plastics. Alas we don't make Powder Coat colors , but I do have the source
&gt;books for them.

&gt;Personally I think that of the two the RAL 9003 (Signal White) is the best
&gt;match to L-82.

What type of spectrophotometer are you using to match colors and what
lighting?
