This afternoon I did a bunch of odds and ends to the bus.  I started out by
powerwashing the insides of those pieces that slide into each end of the
axle beam which hold the kingpins.  They had lots of old grease in them so I
was able to blast them out spic and span.  I spent about 30 seconds on each
part and the grease just flew but that is what good hot soapy water does for
you.  Next off was to head for the shop at my grandparent's house.  On the
way, I spied a 3.5 hp rototiller and lawnboy mower sitting by the curb for
the citywide spring cleanup (you guessed it......trash.)  I wrote the owner
a note asking for permission to pick it up and sure enough, when I drove by
an hour later, someone had beat me to it - my note still stuck in the front
door.  Like I need another small engine sitting around the place anyway.

I installed the steering box on the bus and torqued the nuts to around 28 to
29 footlbs per Bentley.  Next I attempted to drill a hole in the frame
member immediately below the clutch pedal tube.  I had forgotten that my
drill quit running last week and I had never bothered to check why.  Now
when I needed it, it was dead.  Between my grandfather and I, I'm the only
one with a 1/2&quot; chuck hand drill so I had to fix it or just quit for the
night.  Turns out my brushes were worn out and beings this is the stix of
Nebrasky on a Sunday afternoon, everything is closed.  So what to do?  I
remembered having some brushes in a little plastic case in the shop.  My
father has had them since the 60's in their little plastic container and
he's long since forgotten what they were for.  (Methinks they are for a
vaccuum cleaner motor.)  Anyway, between my grandfather and I, we filed down
a set of brushes and soldered them into the old plastic cages that held the
original brushes.  Now my drill works again and I fixed it for free - yeah!

So I drilled me a hole in the bottom of the bus then soldered some zerks
into some copper tubing.  Next I drilled and tapped a hole in the clutch
pedal tube right in the center of it.  Due to the length of the zerk
threads, I put an aluminum crush washer over the end of it and tightened it
down.  Then I was able to install the pedal assembly and cable arm.  The
zerk now just hangs out of the frame far enough for me to get a grease gun
on it.  VW used some of them plagued phospher bronze bushings.  I've never
met one of them oil impregnated bushings that I like.  I hate 'em.  At least
this way I can keep the clutch pedal pivot lubed up and do it at the same
time I do my 1200 mile grease job on the front end.

By this time I was getting pretty dang tired.  I drilled out a twisted off
bolt which goes in the center front hole for the belly pan and then ran a
tap through all of the belly pan holes to clean up the rust and so forth so
the pan installation will go a lot easier. Tomorrow I'm going to buy an
Argon bottle because I need to weld that little brake pedal tab underneath
the bus which is cracked and about ready to snap off.  I hope using the mig
will do the job.  Once that tab is welded, I can get the brake stuff back on
and in order.  My load of front end parts should be here tomorrow and my
swing lever reamer tool (which I rented from Bus Boys) the day after so
despite all the work I've done, I've only just begun.

I think I'm gonna go get that lawnboy. :-)
