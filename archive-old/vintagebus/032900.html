&lt;&lt; From my experiences this is a high price ($25.00) for a wheel...  Maybe if

 tire on it. &gt;&gt;

Hi Adrian,
If you can get 16&quot; VW rims for $25.00 we would like to buy alot of them even 
with a finders mark up for you!  For 15&quot; rims we have been able to find one 
here and there for $5-10.00 each, but it takes awhile even with all the VW 
shows we have out here in the PNW.  For those living in areas where VWs are 
rare to nonexistant or just need thier rims now to get thier bus running 
right $25.00 is not bad for straight ones without old tires on them.

PS A quicky way to check for rim straightness is to jack and remove one of 
your front tires from your simular patterned lugged VW.  Then install the 
questionable rim and give it a spin to see if it is bent out and/or in!
