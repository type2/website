I respond:

That applies in my case as well.  If I am asking for your time
I'm also saying I'll at least pay you something for it.

Let's take your transaxel example.

You are going to make probably $150 on the labor on that transaxel.
Your hands are going to get mashed and greasy, you're going to be on 
your roll-around for a couple of hours. You like to do that, so that is 
perfectly OK.

I call you and ask you a question about another transaxel.  You answer
nicely, give me an outrageous price for a new device.  I say thank you
and tell you to ship it to me.  You just made probably $300 for talking
to me for ten minutes.  I feel good about dealing with you and tell 
everybody I come in contact with you're a nice guy.

On the other hand, you give me attitude when I call you, tell me 
to drop dead, you got the knowledge and you don't give it out for
free.  I say good day, give the phone the finger, and everyone
I talk to avoids your name, or if it comes up, I say something negative
about it.

Just like the other day,  I ask who could put together a kit for rebuilding
reduction boxes.  I got one guy who went to the trouble to try to find me 
exactly what I wanted.  He followed up.  I bought all bearings and seal 
from him.  We spoke maybe 15 minutes total.  I could have found the
bearings and seals myself.  But I ask the list, knowing the supply guys are
out
there. One guy pursued it.  He could have charged me an extra $100, but
he didn't.

Now when anyone asks me about it, I'll give them a name.

Cecil
