&gt; Hello, I have a T2 1978 VW Bus and want to tow a 5x11 foot trailor. Is
&gt; there a tow bar for the 1978 Bus? Where do I find one? Please e mail me
&gt; with any information.


I will have three genuine Westfalia 68-79 bus trailer hitches arriving from
Europe in a few weeks.  These are very heavy duty hitches, which actually
replace your stock bumper brackets.  These were never offered in the U.S.
before.  They come with a 2&quot; ball.  Since they use the European style of
mounting the ball to the hitch, replacing it with another size ball would
require fabrication, so make sure your trailer can take the 2&quot; size ball
(most do).  Price will be $249. I do not expect to have any more when these
are sold.
