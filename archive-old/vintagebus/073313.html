Subject: travel postcard from P &amp; C

Oct 8, 2003 
Time for the newest travel postcards.  They are posted at

http://home.earthlink_dot_net/~toyfield/postcard/

We headed back to New Mexico for the Busses and Balloons VW meet in Albuquerque and wandered through the El Morro and El Malpais National Monuments.  We hiked up the cliffs in El Morro and in El Malpais we went caving in the lava tubes.  The Busses and Balloons weekend started off with a rainy friday and we were concerned but the Saturday event was nice and the mass ascension was magnificent.

We are currently staying with VW friends Bill &amp; Janet in Las Cruces, NM.  We plan to head down to Las Palomas, Mexico for a day visit tomorrow.  Since the weather seems to be holding we will be leaving for Carlsbad Caverns on Sunday and then down to Big Bend National Park in Texas for a while.
