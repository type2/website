Subject: Life with a bus and a bug.

I thought I would post this little tidbit of info as to what my life has
been like since I've been driving the bus around.  It's been quite a
memorable experience and one I'll definitely never forget.

Taking that first ride has got to be the pinnacle of auto repair nirvana.
As time goes on as you feel your ride doesn't have the fun factor or new
fell anymore, all you gotta do is do another repair or simply clean the
vehicle off and drive it to get a better feeling for your ride.  I know I
get discouraged with my VWs (they're beaters when it comes right down to it)
but then something happens and I like them all over again.

I've been driving the 67 to work every day.  My old parking spot which is
between an open gate and chainlink fence is where my 67 spends its days
waiting for me to leave for home at lunch and at supper time.  It gets a lot
of exposure here with upwards of 50 to 75 vehicles per day rolling thru the
gates.  I've managed to take out a couple of small deliveries for the lumber
yard around town and a bunch of the guys when we head out on a big sheet
rock load that requires a labour force.  When it comes to the deliveres, we
have to fill out a sheet that says where we went, what time we left and
returned, what vehicle we took, etc.  It's neat to go down the list and see
the occasional &quot;VW Bus&quot; that I've penned in.  :-)  Yesterday I hauled 2 guys
out to the job site where we unloaded 102 pcs of 8' sheet rock (small load
for us.)  We rolled up to the guys' house in the bus and he jokingly made
the comment about how I was able to fit all that sheetrock into that little
van.  The delivery truck followed up a couple minutes later.

I've taken my family around town for supper and to run errands.  I've put in
the original back seat (with beefy aluminum jail bar) and the middle seat
from a baywindow (leaned up back to back with the front seats) so that
people sitting in the bus can face each other.  Despite this, my Dad was a
bit reluctant to ride in the bus.  My initial attempts at getting him to
ride were futile - he didn't like being right up front or anywhere in the
bus for that matter.  One hot day he was out for a walk (finding all kinds
of junk - this time a craftsman 10mm socket on the side of the road and a
nice chain tow hook) and I stopped to see if he wanted a ride.  He hopped in
but white-knuckled the crap bar and sliding window frame until we stopped
for supper.

Last night dad was all excited and told me he had seen a drunk guy driving
down the road in a Ford pickup and his tailgate fell off.  Dad wanted to go
see if the tailgate was still there and sure enough there it was so we threw
it in the bus.  I don't know what he wants to do with it because it's beat
up but he'll figure out something to do with it.

So today I'm here sick with a scratchy throat and phlegm that could be used
to glue in a headliner.  I managed to stumble out to Li'l Red and drive to
the bank to take care of some business but that's been about it.  I think
I'll take a break from the bus and see about taking care of some loose ends
on Li'l Red this weekend if I get the chance.  It sure would be nice to get
those new tranny mounts put in.

I guess that's all for now.
