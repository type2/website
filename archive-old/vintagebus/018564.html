...Mineral spirits and then silicone. Armor All,
despite what anyone tells you, is not good for rubber.
Vinyl, yes, rubber, no. Get yourself a product like
Black Magic, which is nearly 100% silicone. 

Careful about using any solvents on your seals, some
solvents will eat rubber. Mineral spirits, AFAIK, will
not.
