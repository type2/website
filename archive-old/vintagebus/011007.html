Hi Kevin,
Best manual is the original two volumn VW 1963-67 bus shop manuals for 
$150.00-200.00.  You can get it cheaper by buying the Bentley reprint for 
$60.00 - 90.00 depending where you get it.  The only downfall to the reprint 
is that the original color wiring diagrams are B/W instead!  
  Reserve switch is under the gas tank just barely forward of the starter.  
If you are looking for the control knob in the cab it is to the right (Right 
= Reserve!) of the heater control knob.  The knob to the left side is the 
choke knob.   Eric&amp;Barb
