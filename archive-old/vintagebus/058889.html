Subject: RE: [VB] Non-Stock Muffler and Engine Temp

   The next engine going on the dyno will be a 1679, 69X88 cut-ins. This
engine will have stock (new) single port heads, CW crank, balanced etc and a
30 pict 1 carb. One of the things we are going to do on this test is try a
stock exhaust, a 1 3/8 header and a 1 1/2 inch header. We will moniter the
engine heat with different exhaust as well as the change in HP and torque.
   The goal is to see exactly what difference the exhaust will make with
temps and hp on this engine.

Another place I like to mount and oil temp or Berg sender is if using a
universal case with a T3 blockoff plate.  Just drill and tap a 1/8 NPT
into the plate and mount the sender there.  This keeps it out of the way
and still checks the sump temps.  Some people also believe in looking only
at the oil after it is cooled before it goes to the bearings but i've
never tried this.
