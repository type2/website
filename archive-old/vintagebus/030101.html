I throw some change in on this one....
I say that if you clearly stated that he would have to pay storage fees after
the 30 days were up...that he should pay them before getting the bus...unless
of course there are extenuating circumstances that would prohibit him from
making shipping arrangements (sudden death in family...or of him, military
invasion, molested by aliens...etc).  If he's just slackin' (like I tend to
do) then he should have to cough up the dough.  Try to contact him saying he
owes such and such amount and that the bus NEEDS to be gone within X amount
of days...weeks...what have you.  If it isn't gone, give him a partial (less
non refundable deposit...whatever that may be...and storage fees of course)
refund and put it back up on the block...
OR... I'll pay the shipping fees now and you can send the bus to me...after
all...you already got paid for it right??  ;-)

&gt; but I made it clear that the bus needed to be picked up within 30
&gt; days after the sale.I also informed him that he will need to pay
&gt; storage per day after that..but still nothing and he now owes over
&gt; $500 in storage...what should I do next???-cameron
