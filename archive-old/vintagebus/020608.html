I agree. I had the same question, until the list
suggested unanimously about pulling them together and
I was very happy I did.

Now, another question.

I have them out and I'm working on the motor. When the
mtor's done, should I put them back together and put
them in together?

Also, how much stuff goes on the engine (doghouse
setup) before I put it in?

&gt; 
&gt; Sounds like the old joke about the gynecologist that
&gt; decided to become an
&gt; auto mechanic. She took sixteen weeks to finish the
&gt; engine rebuild at the
&gt; school, but got an A because she did the whole job
&gt; through the spark plug
&gt; holes.
&gt; 
&gt; You can pull the engine and tranny together if you
&gt; like, but dropping the
&gt; tranny and leaving the engine is like blowing hot
&gt; smoke up a canary's _at_$$.
&gt; You have to hold your mouth just right, and the
&gt; situation can deteriorate in
&gt; a hurry. Just do it like thousands of other
&gt; satisfied customers. It will be
&gt; quicker by far, much safer, and you'll be happier
&gt; knowing that you won't be
&gt; inventing a new procedure from scratch that no one
&gt; else will ever use.
