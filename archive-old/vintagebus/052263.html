&lt;&lt; Hi Rich,
 Good to hear of your multiple window rubber replacement success!  For tar in 
 cloth use a hand goop type of product and an old toothbrush to work it into 
 the tar spots.  This stuff works best if rubbed in when the cloth is dry of 
 water and then run it thru a wash.  We have saved many vintage VW tee shirts 
 this way that otherwise would have been thrown away.   Eric&amp;Barb

ya, i tried that tip the other day after using roofing tar on the roof, and 
it did work on clothes.  I use the orangey smelling hand goop.
