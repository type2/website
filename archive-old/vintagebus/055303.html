Subject: Re: [VB] What is an early 60s Panel worth?

Here's one data point from the &quot;Old Cars Price Guide&quot;: ballpark values
for a 60-64 Type 2
Kombi (their survey doesn't include panels for these years):

1--trailer queen, never driven:  $18000
2--excellent original or superior resto:  $9800
3--good amateur resto, presentable &amp; serviceable:  $5600
4--deteriorated resto, but driveable:  $2800
5--needs complete resto, but not wrecked:  $1700
6--parts car:  $550

&gt; Have to ask you all this. My friend has an early 60's model Panel. The rear
&gt; end has been cut out from the previous owner for a buggy. Other then that
&gt; the front nose is bent somewhat, the body seems to be in good shape, but
&gt; didn't get under or really investigate in other portions.
&gt;    Any Ideas?
