I just went through the same thing.  As an EMERGENCY measure, you rip the
seal out from the cap... that will vent it (too much).  Perhaps just cut
some notches in the seal?

At the sshow last weekend I picked up a NOS VW one for my '67 ($15, but got
it for $10 as it was a listee).  Has &quot;Kombi&quot; printed on it in the front
(whereas the repo one did not).  I couldn't figure out how the venting
works... is it around the sides of the inside, or are there tiny holes in
the center of the cap?

&gt; &lt;&lt; Is the fuel cap in a 60 single cab supposed to be vented?&gt;&gt;
&gt; Hi John,
&gt; You bet it it should in at least all 1949-67 buses.
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;&lt; My new cheapo repo is not, and with no gauge sender or other leaky
places 

&gt; Yes it will.  Have known some to end up crushing the sender due to this!

I'll solidly second this.  My once-mint condition original tank in my 66
was crushed after 2 fillups from a nonvented RMM cap.  Mashed the sender
pretty bad to.

Contacted RMM, they stated that they knew about this problem, and that
every cap they sell is not vented.  They also claimed that no one makes an
aftermarket cap for splits that IS vented.  They also refused to replace
the tank, sender, or even refund the $ for the cap.

alas.
