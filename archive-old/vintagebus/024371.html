Subject: RE: Battery suggestions

Chris, I guess I should have clarified (and I shouldn't generalize). I
expect my VWs to start reliably down to about -15 Farenheit with a
traditional battery and 5-20 weight oil. I would hope the Optima would
start the Bus down to at least -20 or -25!

How is the life of an Optima? When I priced them at a local FLAPS, they
were about $120 US. They have other advantages over traditional
batteries, but I would have to get about 15 years life out of it to make
it a comparable deal based on usable life.

pd

&gt; Optima batteries rule. And whoever got the impression that
&gt; Californians don't get cold? It's 20 degrees outside right now....
&gt; Chris
-SNIP-
&gt;&gt; also supposed to provide good starting power at low temperatures, which
&gt;&gt; the California crowd won't care about but some of us do.
