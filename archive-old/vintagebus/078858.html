Subject: VWoA Headquarters Visits

I am wondering if anyone on the list has ever gone to VWoA in Auburn Hills,
Michigan! Do they have  museum open to the public and is it regular hours!!
Looking for day trips on our 15 day Canadian outing, Eh! Going to try and
take a ferry with our busses across on of those big lakes...Lake Michigan
maybe!  Hopefully no Edmond Fitzgerald ride to the bottom!  Also found a
place where they have world class rapids and they boogie board down them!
Got see where that is on the map!  Going to go look at some fog light houses
on the edge of the great lakes!  Looking for suggestions leaving from Omaha
on July 24th North to Canada over some lakes to Detroit area back to Canada
and than Niagara and Busses of the Corn!  Have to be at work the Tuesday
after the campout so Aug 8th, Sunday and Aug 9th, Monday will be long
driving days across Iowa, Illinois, and Michigan!  Going to be adding to my
State magnets and now I guess I will have to find country magnets also!
Rob
