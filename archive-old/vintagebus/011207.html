I am writing this message and this is the only message that I will write. We 
had a family business restoring VW &quot;S we have restored several over the past 
few years. We had a problem with getting the vehicle completed on time due to 
many reasons,
mainly employee problems. We have tried everything to speed up the process, 
however we decided to stop restoring and take care of any problems we have 
out there. We have taken care of a great deal, and will satisfy everyone 
concerned. We have sold varies parts to pay some customers and have been very 
successful in making them happy. The person that has posted his website 
received the bus, not complete but he demanded it. So we shipped it to him. 
We had put 6 months worth of bodywork into this restoration. When he received 
the bus he called and said it looks great, and wanted to have the engine 
parts shipped which we did. I have before and after pictures and he came to 
see the bus before we even started. The person who actually started all of 
this is also taken care of and is sorry for her actions. They came in and we 
worked things out and can verify we are honest people and will take care of 
the problems. I am compiling any info. that is posted by Jack Stennar and 
have an attorney that is currently working on this. There are things being 
said that are not true, by jack and some other emails that are subject to 
slander and liable charges. So PLEASE be careful with this as you should know 
all the facts before making any judgment on someone. I wonder if these people 
could face me or call me with the content of their trash email?  I am working 
to take care of any problems and plan on this to be completed very soon.
Thanks Very much for your time, and also thankyou for the people that are 
supporting me. FRANK LEACH
