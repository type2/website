Subject: Reduction box rebuild
Date: Mon, 30 Nov 1998 13:48:47 -0600

Any body on the list know if one of the vendors has
a complete kit to refurb the reduction boxes and axle
tubes from the tranny side covers out?

Thom, you just did this.  Did you have to find single parts
or did you have a full kit?

If this doesn't exist, maybe some vendor will think it is a good
idea.

Cecil
