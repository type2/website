Subject: Re: [VB] Test for Oil Pressure Gauge

Hi Apstockton,
First check that you have power going to the gauge and a working ground at 
the gauge.  Next remove the wire going to the sender and ground out that 
terminal on the gauge to the body.  If you get movement with this test then the 
wiring to the sender or the sender itself is bad.
  Reconnect the wire from the gauge going to the sender and ground the sender 
end of this wire to see if you again get gauge movement.  If so, you have a 
bad sender or one that is not grounding properly.
