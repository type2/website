Subject: T4 tranny into a vintagebus

I know this won't be a popular topic. I've actually tried to discuss 
it before. So I don't really need the &quot;why would you&quot; or the &quot;if you 
want a bay, by one&quot; answers.

This would be for a full-on custom bus.

I'd be running a T4 engine, and have been looking at matching it with 
a baywindow tranny. Here's my thoughts so far.

Big bus IRS stuff can be installed. There's kits out there that do it 
right now. And there are mounting adapters that allow for a T4 tranny 
to be installed into a bug. So it seems that it wouldn't be that far 
fetched to put a T4 tranny into an early bus. I'm guessing to use a 
late 70's 091 tranny with maybe an early bay bell-housing. This would 
seem to allow more room for the engine while giving the higher 
gearing.

I don't think anyone on the list has done this. I havn't located 
anyone on the net at other places that have done this. But I do know 
it HAS been done. I met a guy on the road once who did it and 
everything looked nice. Unfortunatly I only had about 10 minutes to 
talk and look at his bus. But it was stock looking and really cruised 
on the highway. Seems like a nice beefy way to go. Especially with a 
big T4 engine.
