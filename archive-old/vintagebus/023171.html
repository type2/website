&gt;hmmm, why would you say that... looks pretty clean and straight to me.

Well, one, it's a Riviera...not a Westy.  I love my Riviera dearly, but I
thought paying $2300 was still too much for it.  Anyway, that aside, I
really would have to see more of it before agreeing that it's worth that
much.  How's the interior?  How does the engine sound? Tranny?  Etc...see,
I think this is why I'll never buy a car off eBay or sight-unseen.  I need
to experience it to feel right about it.  But if someone's willing to pay
$4500 for it and is totally happy with that, please give it a good home and
treat it right. :)
