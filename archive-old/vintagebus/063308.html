Subject: Re: [VB] dim headlights/voltage ?'s now bus won't start

&gt;
&gt;I have just looked in the bentley guide pg E-10 1. I guess I have the
&gt;connector that is not in the photo-as my bus was built prior to august 1
&gt;1965.  [...]  Now the problem in the design-there is nothing holding the
&gt;wire tight to the copper connector-just the spring. I think there is too
&gt;much slop in there. In other words I can actually see space between the
&gt;connector and the wire.

From that description, I would agree.  If you can feel this connection
getting hot -- it gets a little warm anyway from the filament but if
it's really hot where the wire goes into the copper connector -- then
that's another clue.
  
&gt;I think tomorrow night I will try circumventing the connector and just 
&gt;use some aligator clips between the headlight and the wires of the bus...
&gt;if this works ~ the problem is in the plastic connector,right?

Very likely.

What you might do is pull the wires out of the connectors you have,
buy some push-on sockets, and crimp or solder them directly on to the
wires.  You won't have the little plastic piece to hold all 3 connectors
together, so you'll have to pay attention when you change a burned-out
headlight in the future.  Do note that the headlight lugs are wider
than the standard 0.25&quot; push-on connector - you can get wider push-ons
but you might have to look around a bit for them.

You can still get a ready-made headlamp connector with wires, like the
one in the Bentley, and splice the connector wires to the Bus wires.
Putting the separate push-ons on the Bus wires may help avoid a little
extra voltage drop, but if the current connector is making poor contact,
anything might be an improvement. 
 
&gt;A side note about the wiring diagrams....one thing that has confused me
&gt;about the diagrams-My bus has a regulator which is not attached to the
&gt;generator-als post august '65 usa version wiring diagram. which does not
&gt;match when my bus was made?  anyone else have this situation?

My '64 (built November 1963) is like this too.  On page E-4 1 of the
Bentley, it mentions that Buses with 1500 engines had the separately
mounted regulator, and implies this was happening at least as early
as 5 May 1964.  Doliwa says the 200 W generator with separate regulator
started on 7 January 1963 and doesn't make any 1200/1500 distinctions.
