An 1154 is the 6-volt equivalent of the 1157.  You can run it, but it won't
last very long!

I believe the 2057 is esentially the same as the 1157.

&gt;&gt; oops, wrong number. The brighter bulb was an 1154. Is it okay to run two
&gt;&gt; 1154's instead of 1157's? I also found a 2057 in my junk box. What are
&gt;&gt; they for?
