&gt; I have to put in a plug for this eekbayer - I lost a tool  auction he had
&gt; by .25 cents; he agreed to duplicate the tools, for the same price... and
&gt; threw in another tool. A truly helpful man.
&gt; If you have a tool request, buzz him; if he has it, he often will just sell
&gt; it outright, as opposed to feebaying it. You need to have the tool NUMBER
&gt; tho, as that's how he knows his stock.
&gt; I'm putting together a wish list :)
&gt;
&gt; Wish all the sellers on that horrid place were as nice as Mark!
