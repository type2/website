Why not get some real paint and reducer and use a PreVal sprayer.
You can get them from auto paint stores and Ive even seen them at Home
Depot here. They only cost around 5.00 for the power unit and jar.
I couldnt find the link at precision valve the mfg but look here if youve
never seen them...

cheers

&gt; I found one place on the web in Michigan or the like that will custom mix 
&gt; and rattle can load paint... don't know anything about quality since I opted 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Before I got a auto body supply store to mix up a batch of real L87, I
&gt; &gt;BTW some auto body supply stores will mix up real L87 and put it in
&gt; &gt;rattle cans for you.  Inquire locally, as they say...
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Does anyone know of a reasonable match to L87 Pearl White that is
&gt; &gt; &gt; available in a rattle can?  Something in an over the counter spray from
&gt; &gt; &gt; a FLAP that I can use for a quickie touch up.  Likewise for L82 Silver
&gt; &gt; &gt; White.
