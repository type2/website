&gt;  I want to pull the key barrel out
&gt;  of some of my door handles for two reasons..
&gt;  
&gt;  (1) So I get the handles rechromed, and
&gt;  
&gt;  (2) A more potentially interesting reason...
&gt;  I have been told by a normally reliable source
&gt;  (bout 80% reliable 8-)) that if you take the
&gt;  barrel out you can actually 're-tumbler'
&gt;  the barrel to suit your key (as opposed
&gt;  to getting a key cut to suit the barrel).
&gt;  
&gt;  Apparently the 8 tumbler gizmos in the barrel are coded
&gt;  by notches (0,1,2 or 3 notches) and if you
&gt;  note the order of the tumblers for a barrel
&gt;  (that you have the key for) you can simply rebuild all
&gt;  your locks for the one key using tumbler
&gt;  gizmos that you've pulled from all those
&gt;  spare handles you have lying around......better than having
&gt;  one key for every door lock I reckon..
&gt;  
==============
it depends on which handle you mean.   remov ethe handle, look for the tiny 
screw.   use the tiny screw to loosen (not remove) the tiny screw. Insert key 
in lock, remove key, tumbler should come with.   When removing key, realise 
that the wafers are spring loaded, and may pop out when you remove the key.   
 Front door handle require slight disassembly before you can access the tiny 
screw.  Dont strip out the tiny screws head.
