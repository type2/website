You know I have never talked to him, not even throught this list....

It seems strange that everyone is so resigned to think he might have
committed suicide. But from what everyone writes he doesn't seem to have
had any reason to do that... Not any signs of needing help... 

For all we know he went into his garage, started his car, and then had
something happen and he passed out... This happened to a friend of mine
once and he almost died.... He started his car in the garage and then had
a mild heart
attach and fell on the floor and couldnt get up... He would of died of
carbon minoxide poisoning if his mom hadn't needed to go to the garage to
start some laundry...

Now I know that this is all a little bit beyond the point but while  you
pray for his soul and family don't be so sure he took his own life...
Unless you were there you never know.

Greg
