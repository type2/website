&gt; I understand that there was a kit to install the larger Type 4 oil cooler
&gt; on a Type 1 engine, mabe w/ a modified fan shroud, w/ a bigger 'doghouse'?
&gt; That sounds like a legitamate modification which might actually work.  Is
&gt; that a Gene Berg idea?  Is it still available?
&gt; 

I don't know who came up with the idea, I heard about it from Eric&amp;Barb (VeeWee111).  The deal is the fan shroud, the cover over the cooler, and the L shaped deflecter must be modified (cut and a strip welded into widen them) to cover the larger cooler.  The studs for the cooler must be switched over for longer ones, or the 3 10mm nuts won't hold the cooler onto the base of it.   Use same fan and cooler base I put this set up in my 65 westy, w/ 1600 sp, and noticed a drop in oil temp.
