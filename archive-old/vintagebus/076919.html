Subject: Re: [VB] battery explosion cleanup

get a box of baking sodea and spinkle it liberally around where the corrosion is happening.  Arm and Hammer is your friend.

 add water to creat a solution so the soda can neutralise the acid

 rinse with a hose, repeat.

wash hands and clothes.   Battery acid will eat through your jeans.  If you sit on a battery and some got on your jeans and you walk around people might not tell you your _at_ss is hanging out.

 Subject: [VB] battery explosion cleanup

 As you may remember, I posted an earlier message about
 my battery exploding.  &lt;snip&gt;
The next couple days I noticed a white and
brown corrosion building up in places.    Does anyone
have experience with this kind of contamination?
