SOTO meet at the Duck Pond, Anaheim, CA?  That's right across the street
&gt;from the best brew pub in Orange county. I'll meet everyone there and
have a show in the parking lot!  Free!

       -Harry (still highly urinated that I wasn't told last year's SOTO
raffle was winner must be present to win)

p.s. At Kelly Park, look for the tall goofy white guy wearing a
Doonesbury Desert Storm camo hat. Might be me.
