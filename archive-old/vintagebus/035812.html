How are belly pans mounted to the bottom of the bus?  Bolted or welded?
I have a bunch of POR15 that I plan to use to keep my bus from ever rusting 
away. I've heard that the belly pans are good for water to sit a possibly 
start rusting. I would like to coat both sides of the pans, frame rails, 
outriggers, etc... I don't want to have to pay Kelly (Metwiz) to fix all this 
stuff in the future.
Is this something that would be relatively easy to do?
Thanks,
Brian
