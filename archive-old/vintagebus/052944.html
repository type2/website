Moly (molybdenum disulfide) is the sh*t when it comes to lubrication. It
will coat steel parts and stay there under EXTREME pressure. It is widely
used in the machining industry to lubricate taps and other cutting tools
because the coating will cling to the cutting tool even under the pressures
necessary to cut steel. Buy the moly and use it according to the
instructions.

I was attempting to mix the 3 to 1 STP to grease and no luck finding the STP
transmission treatment here in Kingston.  There is an STP engine treatment
that is about the consistency of grease but that can't be right.  I did find
this stuff that was a transmission additive called moly.... something.  It
was in a toothpaste shape tube - except wider. Anyone think that stuff would
work?  Or should I just keep a huntin' for the STP transmission additive?

TIA
