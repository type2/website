Hi Sam,
Other than replacing your arms with NOS units or at least figuring out how to 
replace the springs inside the base, you can bend/bow the arms so as to 
create more pressure.  The other thing to MAKE SURE OF is that your wipers are set 
in such a way as to evenly flop as the wiper arm switches direction.  This 
often requires a slight twisting of the arm to provide this.  Otherwise the blade 
will pogo in one direction as it swipes, making any attempt at wiping the 
water off impossible.
