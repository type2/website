Subject: Kennedy pressure plate, engine update

First off, not much to say on the engine update. I was hoping my new
flywheel would get here today at the latest, but I guess it will be next
week... I am still unable to get 3 of the broken dowel pins out, but I
still have 5 open holes. I showed this to a local VW hotrod guru, and he
said that he would just go ahead and run it with the 5 dowels, and just
forget about the other 3. I guess that's what I'm gonna do...

We had a good used Kennedy 1700 lb. pressure plate laying around the
shop, so I decided to use it. I wound up installing it with the old
engine (since the new one isn't ready yet). I had to tighten up the
clutch cable ding-dong tight just so I can change gears, and even then,
gear changing is pretty rough. I can't get the clutch to disengage
entirely, so I'm having to match engine speed while shifting...

The Kennedy pressure plate has 3 levers under a ring, rather than a
whole bunch of fingers under the ring that the throwout bearing pushes
against. At the bottom of the levers there are 13mm nuts. I've heard
that some pressure plates can be adjusted... Is this one of them? I
don't have the p.p. in front of me (it's in the bus, until the new
engine is ready).

Just wondering...
