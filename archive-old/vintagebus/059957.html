Subject: Re: [VB] Late model Westy help needed

Terrible design, you should go ahead and just send it to me and I'll dispose
of it. 8-)

what you most likely have is an S069, kind of the bay equivalent of the
SO44. Sold as a European and Canadian model due to the propane bottle being
inside the vehicle. Can be either walkthru or bench although I've yet to see
a walkthru in person. Has a hanging closet behind the driver and if a bench,
it has a stove with lid and a refrigerator although I think a icebox may
also have been a option. Most likely has a full bed but again I think you
could also have another cabinet as a option. Some also have a hanging
cabinet that you could call a headbanger. I think most of em actually had
the small poptop as opposed to the dorm top, but again if you bought it in
Europe, you could get it your way. Pics would be cool if you could send or
post em.

 interior before. It looks almost like a SO44 model but
 I am not sure. Any Ideas? I can email a pic.
