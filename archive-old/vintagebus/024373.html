Subject: Re: Radar Detector? (was Gauges in the bus)

Yeah, I know it can happen, my reply was a feeble attempt at humor.
Funny thing is, I haven't gotten pulled over for speeding in _any_ VW
for at least 10 years... and run my Busses at 65 and Bug at 70. Had a
'78 Chev van for about 1.5yrs... got two speeding tickets driving about
the same speeds. I've gotten pulled over for all sorts of stupid things
(small town cops looking for drugs, I suspect).

Another local Bus Nut friend says he was running a '70 on I-15 with the
speedo pegged. Cop clocked him at 100mph. This guy told the officer he
didn't think the Bus would go that fast, took him around back to see the
tired, oil soaked 1600... the cop decided the radar gun was broken and
let him go! One thing that lends credibility to his story... the engine
blew up a short time later!

Happy Halloween, all, have a safe one!

&gt; One of the guys in our club just got a ticket in his 60. That makes his 3rd
&gt; one. 52 in a 40.

&gt; &gt; Paul,
&gt; &gt;you may be maxed out at 50, but that will get you a ticket in town.
