Subject: barndoor steering dampner, a.k.a. Ellis is not on crack.
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I remember this subject came up a few months ago with Jim ellis swearing his
barndoor had one and i dont recall anyone who believed him...never did see
anyone provide any pictures and I saw this over on tony's page, so if you
