Subject: Re: White Smoke - Been to the Archives

&quot;Suddenly feel a burst of power.  Strange.  Look in
the rearview and billows of white smoke pouring out of the
exhaust.

Drove home with cursing cars behind me.  Let it sit.  Checked the
drips under the bus.  The drips smelled vaguely of gas.&quot;

Check your float and float valve.  White smoke is probably gas.  Did the
exhaust pipe seem much richer than normal&gt;  Was it running really cool? 
Telltale signs.  I just went through the same thing on the trips to
Edisto Freez Yer Toe and PaddysWagens.
