&gt;Steve, yes all of the VW Birth Certificates I've seen list the destination 
&gt;dealer.  (or at least the destination city and country).

Ah, there's a big difference between destination city/country and the 
actual dealership!  I would love to know exactly what dealership my Bus was 
sold from, but the closest I can get is finding a Dealers and Distributors 
booklet from that era and seeing what states my port-of-entry covered.  My 
'63 came into Jacksonville and was possibly sold in Florida, Georgia, or 
South Carolina.  &lt;shrugs&gt;  Beyond that is anyone's guess.
