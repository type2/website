Subject: How CKD was CKD?

Hey Volks

A question that's been on my mind for some time:

What exactly did CKD (Completely Knocked Down) mean with regard to VW buses?
All the Type2s built here in South Africa between 1955 and 1980 were built
from German CKD kits, as were the 1975-only run of Brazilian splitties. How
completely knocked down was a CKD kit?

Did it involve every individual part of a bus boxed for assembly like some
huge Meccano set? Were any parts of the bodyshell preassembled? Were engines
or other major subassemblies like transmissions and axles preassembled?

Does anybody know anything at all about VW CKD kits?
