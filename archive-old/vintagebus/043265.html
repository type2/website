&gt;I've been trying to buy all the early lit I can to scan and put on my
&gt;page.  

Information wants to be free... :)

&gt;OTOT, scanning these and making them available &quot;devalues&quot; the originals,
&gt;but oh-well - I ain't in it for the money.

I agree with others' comments that nothing beats having a book in your
hand.  But since for most of these manuals, you aren't going to be
able to get one at Borders or call up Bentley and order one, the scans
are way better than nothing.

The scans do devalue the original in some ways.  If someone is a lit
collector then they don't.  But if it's the weekend, your Bus is
broken, and you want to get it back together before Monday, knowing
you can look at the scans online for free makes it less likely that
you will buy a copy on [auction site] for $$.$$ or even $$$.$$ .
Note that this is not exactly the same argument as copyright.  If
VW was still selling the originals then the argument that the scans
devalue the originals would be much stronger (like, &quot;actionable&quot;).

Any trouble that the doc project runs into will be (IMHO) because
of people on [auction site] that are trying to sell an old VW parts
manual for $300 and don't understand the difference between the
&quot;lit collector&quot; and &quot;bus fixer&quot; market.  The lit collectors might
just pay it, but for the bus fixer market, the free scans are 
the competition.  Since the seller doesn't want to compete on 
price, and may think that the free scans are valuable to *both*
markets, they may try to interfere with the competition.  Note that
this is pure conjecture at this point - nobody has given any flak
that I'm aware of!!

Anyway, just my opinion.

Matt Roberds
