Subject: RE: [VB] 1961 DC correct front doors???

  The handle changed to the recessed (indented style) somewhere in
November/December
1960 at chassis number 705 620 part number 211 837 205 D. Model year change
was generally in August of 1960. Thus making yours a 1961 with the recessed
ice pick handle, which was also used up till early/mid 1964.

ps. Being E and B, and Clara are at the Vintage meets this weekend, I
thought I'd post this to save them the trouble when they get home!

Subject: [VB] 1961 DC correct front doors???


Been away for a while with a new job, new son etc. 
Still working on the 61 DC.  Real slow progress. 
Almost have all the parts painted and ready to go back
together.  This is in now way a restoration.  Just
want it to look OK and work well.

I noticed that in my quest last year to get new doors
that i somehow ended up with 2 different kinds.  Both
pull handle.  One has the handle base (where it mounts
to the door) flat and the other has about a 1/4&quot;
recess.  My 60 DC had the flat doors.  What is correct
for the 61?  I seam to remember that the recessed
version was a one or two year things and that the
handle was different in some way.  Can anyone help and
remind me what is what.

Thanks.
matt
