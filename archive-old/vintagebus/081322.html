Subject: Remember the headlight switch in the dash problem?

Finally, despite the world and all of it's distractions and responsibilities,
I have found time to return to finishing the new wiring harness project. When
last we talked I was wondering about how to mount the &quot;new&quot; vintage switch
into the dash. The first hole to the right of the steering column does not
have a hole that matches the bracket on the bottom of the switch. But the next
one to the right does! So I stretched the wires from the ignition to the
switch and the screw hole matches perfectly.

So on my '63 Sundial (which started life as a delivery/cargo van) the holes in
the dash, from left to right are: the emergency light switch (the light is
directly above), the steering column, a hole that was the light switch but is
now a switch for a heater fan, the headlight switch, the windshield wiper
switch.

I think that, in building these rigs, that some things on them and how they
were put together depended on what parts were laying around, whether Gunther
was sick that day or whether the parts department manager had a fight with his
wife that morning.

I also think that there are huge differences between they built the &quot;deluxe&quot;
models and the cargo vans. I love my bus, but sometimes I think that the guys
in the factory did as little as possible to get this thing sold and on the
job. They certainly had no dream that it would be running around Northwest
Arkansas 42 years later.

Well, it has to be the most entertaining car to drive in the whole world.
