He's got to be kidding- thought I would send this for your information
before I tell him no. (that's being polite in my opinion) If any of you
think that this is a good idea, please let me know. Ted

Hey, Ted,

Here's a thought to help increase the list's funds.  If you decline I
understand why, but I thought I'd offer...

It would be very easy for me to add a part number TYPE2DONATE to the Bus
Depot website, for a value of $5 or $10 (although a quantity of more than 1
could be selected if the person wanted to donate more). This would allow
anyone who bought something at the Depot to at the same time donate to the
list (or perhaps choose to take the money he saved with his listmember
discount and apply it as a donation to the list).  This isn't intended to
replace your Paypal account, which is for people who are specifically
donating to the list, but rather to augment it with &quot;impulse donations&quot; from
people who are buying parts. Kind of the e-commerce equivalent of the can at
the cash register where you put your spare change to support the SPCA or
whatever.

When we send out our accounts-payable checks about once a month, I could cut
you a check for the total of the amount received.  (It would be easy to
track; all I'd have to do is run a report of sales of part number
TYPE2DONATE, then multiply the &quot;quantity sold&quot; by the &quot;value&quot; that we chose
each &quot;unit&quot; to be, $5 or $10.)  For my part of the donation, I'd absorb the
2% credit card processing fee, so you'd get the full value of the donation
without credit card/paypal costs.

My thought is that many people would donate that way if it were as easy as
clicking a button while they are already making a purchase anyway.  It would
increase the donations significantly if each listmember who ordered a part
for their bus threw in even just $5 toward the list each time they ordered.

Of course I'd be more than happy to agree to a post from the list
administrators clearly stating that the ability to donate this way is not
intended to imply endorsement of The Bus Depot.

The offer is open if you want to take me up on it.
