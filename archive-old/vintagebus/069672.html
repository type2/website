Subject: RE: [VB] best brakes, engine and transmission

Well Frank, I can put in my two cents from a 67 SC point of view. I'm an
engine man really and work on the body by necessity. The list has taught me a
lot and driving my SC daily has taught me about it's capability. I had a worn
out 1500 SP when I bought it. The hills were a challenge and carrying anything
was a chore. I quickly built a 1641 DP and slid it in. Now hauling and hills
are no problem. I will stick with the RGB/tranny combo because I like the
extra torque it gives me when I haul loads, which is all the time. The top
speed is around 65, although I could do better with a slightly bigger motor,
like the 1776 on my trike! I went from a 31 PICT on an adapter plate to a
rebuilt 34 PICT-3. I run 137 60 65 jets and the power vs. mileage is OK.

H i I am frank an am new to the list I heard this is THE place so I hope
to get in.
hi folks I am new to the list but not busses I have a 67 with a stock
1500 single port complete with rev limiter. (used to have '65, '68, '69
and '71 westy and many bugs and a dunebuggy)
I just bought the bus here in florida and it is in good shape all
original recent rebuild.


I hope to build an engine with more power and I an looking for some
advice on what you folks think is the best bus engine-I used to work at
a vw shop so my mechanical skills should be adequate.
Then comes the transmission? I have reduction boxes but feel no need to
remove them why not have a transmission built to suit modern traffic. I
would like some oomph and ability to drive at the speed limit. What is
the ideal rpm for hwy cruising.  I swear in my '68 bus with a stock 1600
dp I got 30 mpg on the hwy at 55-60 mph-ithink it turned about 3200. any
favorite vendors?I know a lot of people switch to (cv joints-IRS) but I
have no desire to do this .stock is mostly fine

last and most important is brakes. I remember many a time pulling up on
the steering wheel and down on the brake pedal-scary.  My '71 had disc
brakes and they were great. So I would love to find a disc brake
conversion kit. I recently saw a '63 with discs and he said they were
great. Any one know who offer a kit.
I would like opinions on the vendors that you use for stuf in general-so
let me know

I need some body parts no too many-any favorite vendors
Also our roof is dented all over (i think it rolled) so If I can find a
roof with windows and or a rag top I could cut and switch- any body have
advice on headliner replacement-mine is perfect but will get taken out
if I do any roof body work

One last question body work is not my strong point but I can do it- new
methods have developed so what system are people using for welding in
panels like rocker or battery. Mig , tig or non sheilded. thanks and
remember enjoyment frank
