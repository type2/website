&gt; Anyone have any ideas as to why passenger side blinkers would stop operating

Probably a bad ground.  When the lights are off the little blinker bulbs
can ground throught the big headlight bulbs, but when the headlights are
on there isn't any voltage difference across the blinker bulbs  Where the
ground is is the $64 question.  I'd start near the offending blinker.
