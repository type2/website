Subject: trip across US in progress!

Listees,

I'd forgotten to mention to the list that I was traveling across the US
from LI, NY to Cupertino, CA to begin a new job. I left NY on Saturday 26
April, made it to OKC, OK  the next early evening with no problems.

I had had a strange knocking coming from the rear end on my trip up to NY
from Florida back in February - intermittent. Wierd. When I
pressed the clutch in, it went away. Turns out that when I checked the
tranny oil level before leaving for out west, it was over a quart low!
There'd been no leaks since the rebuild in 00, so I never checked it!
Dumb!

Anyway, I refilled it with my last GL-4 gear oil, checked the boxes too,
they needed a couple ounces each. Doesn't seems as  if I ruined the
tranny, it sounds normal, shifts smoothly. From now on, I'll check it
regularly, like the rest of us bussers do, right? ;-)

I leave OKC for ABQ,NM on Wednesday morning - should take about 10 hours.
Visiting there for a day or so, then leaving for Cupertino, CA by friday
morning.

If you see a 67 Titian Red and Beige-Grey deluxe, heading west on I-40,
and then up the 5, wave! It's prolly me.

regards, cal
