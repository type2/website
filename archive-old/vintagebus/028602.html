Subject: Backfire &amp; Drive your VW day

My wife drove the 64 Single Cab to work today for the DYVWTWD, said it
drove great on the 15 mile interstate drive, when she got to work she
reached down to apply the emergency brake, O NO, it had been on the
whole drive, she was wondering why she could smell brakes at the off
ramp stop light. Of course I said don't worry about it, I'll adjust the
brakes tonight!

And last night checking the truck out, 1600 DP 31-3 carb, I noticed a
backfire when you let off the gas, thought my timing might be retarded a
bit. While I was getting ready to adjust the dist. I heard a spark, it
was coming from the + coil wire that goes to the choke cut off, and then
to the carb thermostat, it was grounding to the - side of the coil. The
wire had NO damage, so would a + wire being that close to the coil's -
cause it to jump out of a good wire?
After I routed it different no more spark or backfire! The &quot;fun &quot; thing
is the spark was arching right next to the fuel filter.

I also can tell a difference with true GL-4 tranny oil in the truck now,
he &quot;seams&quot; to shift so much smother now, of course he might have enjoyed
the attention I was giving him.
