Subject: Re: [VB] For your info and some questions (a bit long)

The date on the M-code plate on my '67 is Dec. 5th '66.  The factory Letter
I got from Germany about my bus says production on the 3rd and delivery on
the 7th.

Andrew
67 Deluxe Bus
75 914 1.8 (for sale)

&gt; The data plate shows the date of manufacture as 31 01 3 which means (if
I'm
&gt; correct) 31 January 1963
&gt; However when I wrote to Volkswagen asking about production history of the
car
&gt; their records show a production date
&gt; of 6 February 1963. The delivery date is 11 February 1963 with the point
of
&gt; delivery shown as Portland, Ore. USA
&gt; The difference in those two production dates is confusing to me.
&gt; I'm wondering, how long was the production cycle for the bus? Is it
possible
&gt; the date on the data plate is the date
&gt; assembly was begun and the 6th February date the actual roll out date?
