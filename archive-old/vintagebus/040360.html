The news of Josh hit me a little differently
than it would have a few months ago.

I lost a brother, his wife, and a friend in a
small plane crash in October.  The news of 
Josh has triggered memories, and I can really
feel for his wife, but also a lot for his parents.
Parents are supposed to go before their children.

I am posting for a similar reason, and this
provides an oppportunity.  Alright, excuse.

My brother and wife left no will, and no information
as to who should be the guardian for their children 
in case of them both dying.  We don't like to think
of such things actually happening, but they do.

We are now in the tangled web of the court system
to determine what will happen in the short term
and long term with their 7 year old son, &amp; her 14 year 
old daughter.

A will only covers the estate (money and stuff that can
be converted to money, like real estate, stocks, etc)
A will does NOT concern the children's guardian.

There are two guardians (could be the same person)
one for the estate money and guardian of the kid.
There could be different guardians for each kid!

Please, please, please, talk to your spouse, and write
out a document with your intentions, wishes, etc.
Talk about it with whomever you would like as guardian.

If you write it out by hand, it's legal.  If typed or printed
you need it notarized.  A simple note can make a HUGE
difference to your children's fate.

Enough rambling on a non-topical note.  To make it 
topical, write another note to establish guardianship for
your bus(es).  So there, bus content established!

'67 Deluxe Hardtop Walkthru (my daughter wants it)
'67 Squareback (One son wants it)
'64 Ford F100 CrewCab (the same son wants it)
'99 4Runner (uh oh, the other son and the daughter both want it!)
'87 Subaru 4WD Wagon (nobody wants it, but then, neither do I, 
but I'm still driving it until bus and/or truck are running reliably)
