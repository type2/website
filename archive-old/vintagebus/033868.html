 I have a 65 dbl door panel. I just put all new rubber in it. The problem
 is that water is coming in under the sliding windows on the doors. any
 ideas how to control this? I would like to install my new door panels
 but don't want them ruined by the water.
 
 Also any ideas on coating the back of W.W. grey door panels with
 something so they don't warp?
  &gt;&gt;
water dripping through the doors is normal- that is how it was designed.  To
protect the cab door panels I take clear plastic and attach it to the door
before installing the panel.   It is important to tuck the bottom of the
plastic inside the bottomof the door.  Yes- w/o the barrier the panel will
warp.  Originally your panels would have had a waxed paper barrier, long since
gone.  I attach the plastic w/bits of duct tape.  Also it is a bad idea to use
any sort of water aborbinginsulation in the cabdoors, as it will act like a
sponge and speed rust out.  I live in the PNW too and see most every day how
important it is to try and keep the water out AMAP.  Have your heat working as
well, to help dry out the bus.
