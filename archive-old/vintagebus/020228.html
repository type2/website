Subject: ACK! Bed liner question
Date: Fri, 25 May 2001 23:52:07 +0000

  I've got that spray on bed liner stuff on the bed of 
my &quot;new&quot; DC, I'm planning on going back to the dove blue 
with oak slats, but I don't know how to get that stuff 
off, any suggestions? I'm sure its going to be a royal 
PITA since it was made to not come off!
Also-   
  I ordered my gauges from Moon yesterday - RPM, oil 
press, oil temp, water temp (maybe I don't need this 
one?), Berg dipstick, O2 meter, 5 cyl. head temperatures 
(1 sender just dangles, it will read ambient 
temperatures that I can use as a reference), volts, fuel 
level, vacuum, boost, clock, and monitor for the engine 
compartment mini cam. I'm mounting them in the fresh air 
overhead panel, above the sun visors, in the radio block-
off plate, in a panel on the parcel shelf and boring a 
hole in my new horn button for the clock. I'm upgrading 
to a 75 amp alternator to power them. Here is a picture 
of what it should look like:

Should all be installed by Oct/The Classic.

Happy Friday!
