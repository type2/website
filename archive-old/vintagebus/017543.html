Aha!  So if this guy was on the up-and-up, he would have pointed out
my error when I said &quot;franchise tax board&quot;!   Thanks for the clarification.

I did notice that he stopped asking shortly thereafter in subsequent auctions.
Without giving away the game, you'll see a lot of catalog stuff in their auctions.

Is St. Board the patron saint of taxation?

&gt; It is the State Board of Equalization governs the sales tax department.  Any
&gt; number that  a seller would have would be there, and they would only have a
&gt; number if they are a reseller, meaning, if their business is to sell parts.
&gt; BTW, a private sale is not subject to tax, however, St. Board may require a
&gt; license if someone practices the same type of private sale.  They even have
&gt; rules on how many garage/yard sales you can have in a year.
