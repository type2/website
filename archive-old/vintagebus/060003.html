Subject: Fw: failure notice


 Hey Folks,
 I acquired a 66 Westy a few weeks ago and looked at another last evening.
I am now gonna have to start with all the questions.
 I choose to start easy, I have noticed on both, that the engine hatch has
an extreme difficult time latching.
 My imagination?  Just a coincidence that both have this problem?  Is it
typical?  Any quick fixes?

 Thanx in advance
 Frank
