&gt;Did anyone ever get down to Area 51 and get spy photos of the elusive 54
Binz?  I have a special spot on my reserved just for such an animal!
&gt;
Spot where? Is it irregular in shape?  Better get that checked out.  ;)

If by Area 51 you mean the RonnieWerks(TM) compound, I heard the government
consulted him about redoing Fort Knox security after I leaked the details
of the security surrounding his plans.
