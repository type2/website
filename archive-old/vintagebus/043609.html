Put it in a dark room with another emblem, some drinks, and some
romantic music.  Leave them alone for the evening.  If in a couple
of months you get lots of little Bug-hood-sized emblems, then yes...

&gt;I want to ask the pro's here if this is straight, it
&gt;has a slight apex in it at the top.

I looked at the one on my '64.  I believe it is OG and painted silver.
It has the peak at the top of the circle like yours does.  There may
be a less well defined peak to the bottom center but you can 
definitely see the one at the top.  I think yours is cool.
