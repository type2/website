Subject:  Webpage update status,, fabbed parts suspended 

Hiya Folks, We are under the gun to finish a couple buses this month or be
&gt; real close to finishing, Kents 56 and Toma's 66 should be all but done by
&gt; this weekend coming. Both are real close to being complete. The game plan
is
&gt; to update the web pages after the 5th of Sept. The reason being i'm
&gt; scheduled for nasal passage surgery that afternoon and according to the
doc
&gt; i'm gonna be grounded from all but boss type work, and desk jockey duty
for
&gt; 2 to 3 weeks.
&gt; We'll not be filling any parts orders at all from now  till after i'm back
&gt; to work. If you want to order in this time fine but don't be in a hurry to
&gt; get them cause it ain't gonna happen. I have been fighting sinuses and ear
&gt; infections for damn near a month, and missed my planned campouts and shows
&gt; in July, and its time things went my way for a while, i'm tired of feeling
&gt; as old as i am ,,grin ..Tony has enough stuff to do in the shop and parts
&gt; are my department not his. Hopefully after these delays are out of the way
&gt; we can get back to business and roll again, later
