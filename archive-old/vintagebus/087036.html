Subject: patching water tank

Hey guys.its been a long time, but I'm trying to get the bus on the road for
a mini-camp weekend coming up.

I've got my water tank from my ez-camper set up out of the bus. It has a
leak where the drain tube comes out of it. I have tried melting the plastic
and replacing the tube. I seem to be slowly making it better, but I still
keep getting these pin-hole leaks in it. Originally the threaded area had
split, I think from me over tightening the drain tube.

Anyone ever patched one of these successfully before? I was thinking if I
could find a water bottle at the store that is made of the same plastic, I
could cut it and make a patch that way. But I have no idea what type of
plastic this is.

Any suggestions appreciated.
