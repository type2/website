Subject: Re: [VB] 60 single cab wheels Q

Wade, et al,

Unless I'm missing something, I think the clue's in Ken's subject line, as
the SUBJECT is &quot; 60 single cab wheels Q&quot; You know far more about the early
trucks than I, wouldn't that make much more sense?

FWIW,

&gt; 50 singlecab? That doesnt exist (according to the factory).
&gt; If you meant &quot;50's&quot; single cab, then it would have 16's if it was pre
march 55. And 15's if it was later 50's.

has bug wheels on it. Can someone tell me what is the correct size wheel for
that year? I'm  guessing 15 inches.
