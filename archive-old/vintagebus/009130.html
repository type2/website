Subject: Re: [VB] My new find- not signed!

Jerry Garcia died August 9, 1995.  When I sold the '66 bus to discover card
in Feb/March of 1998 it was Sea Blue and Cumulus White.   The other bus, the
panel, was sold to Discover card approximately 12 - 18 months earlier and
was an original paint bus at the time of the sale.  Jerry had long since
departed before either of these busses were sold to Discover Card/Novus.
Neither of these busses were previously owned by, painted by, ridden in, or
autographed by, Jerry Garcia.  The only thing they had to do with Jerry
Garcia was a big company painted them with a copy of Jerry's artwork in
order to and get more people to sign up for their credit card.  That is it.
No other relationship.  It isn't a hippy bus, it is a piece of corporate
advertising.  (...but I still love my old bus.)

The graphics were air brushed on by a guy in Myrtle Beach if I remember
correctly.

-Dan
Former owner of '66 Discover Card bus

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; So Woody, are they &lt;the Garcia buses&gt; really signed by
&gt; &gt; Jerry?
&gt;
&gt; I'm not 100% sure.There is a Jerry signature on both buses.If it's
actually
&gt; his hand that did it, I doubt it.An authorized reproduction is my guess.
&gt; Jim, if you look at the photo I sent you ,you will see it over the rear
&gt; wheel well.
&gt; Have a good day all,
&gt;
