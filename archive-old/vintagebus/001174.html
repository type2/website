Yes...$40 was what I wanted to pay, but...

The bumper I got is indeed complete with overriders, mounts, and splashpans.
I was informed by Greg of Vintage Warehouse that it is also the proper
pointed blade for my '67, so that tipped the scales on my decision a
bit..... The guy who I  bought it from wanted $150...wouldn't take $100 or
$120, so...

I did see the really nice painted bumper for $150!!  I was standing over it,
trying to make up my mind when some guy up and bought it!  That sorta
sucked, cuz I was almost there!  It was perfectly straight!
