Subject: Chicks dig it

Sorry gals... I don't mean any offense...

The v80 is definitely a babe magnet guys.... if you're single, this is one
vehicle that will definitely get you noticed. :-)  I picked up my wife last
Friday evening at the college so we could go down and have a beer and
several of my wife's female students told me that it was 'so cute'.... See
guys, you just need to tell them that the stars look so much clearer when
you're 25 feet up in the air ;-)

So, today, it was my wife's birthday.  She brags about the v80 where ever we
go and tells everyone that it's 'HERS'!  I'm a member of the local Rotary
club here in LaGrande so I took her to the noon meeting.  People
congratulated me ( I mean her) on collecting another interesting VW.  After
the meeting, I had to give rides to those willing to go up in the bucket.
My business lawyer is also a member and as the boom was just about fully up
(the end stick still down) he started to tell me he was afraid of heights...
as I started to raise the end stick, he reiterated his fear.  I told him
that if he lowered his next bill I'd take him down right away... weeeeee!
