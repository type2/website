Subject: Hurt Double Cab

Hi Everyone,
I'm the new guy that just did the testing 1,2,3. I'm takin' Buck my 63 DC to
a show in Eureka Springs, AR next Friday. Yesterday afternoon a lady pulled
out in front of me w/o looking a BAM, $900.00 worth of damage to the
passenger door. It could've been worse were it not for my LIGHTENING FAST
reflexes and swerving into the center turn lane to avoid takin' a direct hit
in the nose !! OUCH!! Anywho, a friend of mine says not to worry. He'll have
the door fixed and painted in time fo da sho !! I gotta run and buy paint.
Have a great weekend everyone !!! It's great to be a part of the List.


100% aircooled !

Poteau, OK

63 DC - Buck
66 Kombi
67 Sundial Kamper
73 Type 3 Fastback

p.s. In case you are wondering, the car that hit Buck was a F**D Escort !!
UNINSURED !!
