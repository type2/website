Subject: workin' on the 15-window

Finally got my '61 15-window down to my shop in Moscow instead of sitting
next to my folks house.  My plan is to work on it throught the winter and
the first nice day of Spring throw some paint on it and I'll finally be
back in a bus!
So far I've put the rear wheel wells in, got the front pass. floor almost
in, got the rusty cargo floor and rocker cut out, and Eric C. and I put
the lowered suspension in it from my old '57.  Some pics are on the way.
Anyway, just thought I'd post something since I haven't in a while.
