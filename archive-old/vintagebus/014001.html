&gt; But what about these extra inlets?  What do i do with those?  My current
&gt; air cleaner, the round chrome thing, has an inlet on the bottom, or is
&gt; it the side, of it that has been pinched closed.  So there is the intlet

One gois to the oil breather -that's the smaller of the two.  There's
supposed to be a rubber hose going to this inlet.  It burns off
the crankcase vapors.

The other goes to an outlet that is supposed to be on your muffler,
which feeds warm air into the air cleaner to help it run
better in the cold.  There's supposed to be a paper hose, like
the fresh-air hoses, between them.
