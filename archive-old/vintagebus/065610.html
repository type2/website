Subject: Re: [VB] Tent question

Exclusively, I don't think so.  Check out this guy Ron
http://cgi.ebay_dot_com/ebaymotors/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=1872507093

and if that is not good enough, look at his completed auction
http://cgi.ebay_dot_com/ebaymotors/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=1872417255

It seems he has quite the business going, sticking it to bussers, I
guess Karma
will get him soon enough.  Maybe you should list a few on ebay, Ron,
looks like
they would sell.

This is
&gt; by far the lowest priced VW specific tent on the market, and is
available
&gt; exclusively from the Bus Depot.
