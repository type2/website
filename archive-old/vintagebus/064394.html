&gt; &gt;  &gt; ok, so what do i check to rule this out.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Centerlines of bearing bores for a start.
&gt; &gt;What is the history of this case? 
&gt; 
&gt; new first generation aluminum case from ronnie.
&gt; for the record, i PAID rimco to check cam bore and crank centers for 
&gt; spec; whether they did - or just took the cash - is anybody's guess. 
&gt; they did claim bores were within spec and paralell.

OK, then-
Spec and parallel is a Zero cam gear on a new case.
If -3 and +1 gears don't go - ( Check the warranty :) !
