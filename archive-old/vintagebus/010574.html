&lt;&lt; I'm trying to get the front section of the shift rod out so I can pull the 
front beam. I cant get the front coupler off, I soaked the bolts for weeks, 
heated them and 
 eventually broke the heads off and had to drill them out. &gt;&gt;
Hi,
Best to get a demel or a slightly bigger simular air tool and use a cut off 
abrasive blade in it.  Then slit the coupler down one side and pry open 
slightly with a screwdriver or slit two sides of it.  Or just use a 
oxy/acceleryne torch to cut the coupler at the halfway point between the 
linkage ends.  We did the latter to get our 1960 panel shift linkage apart.  
The coupler is far easier to repair, manufacture, or replace with a good used 
one than either of the two linkage pieces!    Eric&amp;Barb
