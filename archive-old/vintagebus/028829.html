&gt; its scary , you just need to drive slower, hit the brakes for a few seconds
&gt; to keep your speed down, then let them cool before hitting them again.

&gt; Fun rides are going down the Grapevine towards Bakersfield, you can smell the
&gt; big truck brakes and its a LONG downhill run,
&gt;

My favorite's still going from Santa Cruz to San Jose, after being back in
Illinois for15 years, I'm ridin the brake pedal in the right hand lane, both
hands on the wheel feeling like I'm at Great America while some guy screams past
me in a six foot tall monster truck drinkin a beer and talkin on the phone with a
dog hangin' out the back
Remember what John Muir says about brakes...they are a negative force and should
be used as such, only when necessary and then sparingly.
