Subject: dual carb and fuel pressure

After fixing all the usual gas leaks like new hoses and worn metal lines,
I'm still smelling gas around the engine compartment.  I've got dual carbs,
Webbers, and I've read that you need a fuel pressure regulator to reduce
pressure.  Can anyone give me the details like what kind of regulator and
where is the likely place to find one?  Is it that fuel seeps past the float
valve unless pressure is reduced?  I drive my 67 Westy every day so I'm
wondering if maybe I should get on my bike until I fix the fuel problem- I
lost one bus to a fire in the engine compartment.  Thanx for any comments.

John Moore
