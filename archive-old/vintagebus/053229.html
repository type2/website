Subject: Re: RE: [VB] N.A.D.A. Our Buses Value

I dont know about you, but I wish all my buses were worth about $100 each...even though I have waaaay more than that in 'em.  It would be so great if they were worthless.

&gt; Yeah, I bitched at them a while back.  Assuming that did anything (probably
&gt; not), you can blame me for your increased registration fees...  ;)

&gt;  &gt;   Just got back from MVD to register my 15 window and got the shock of
&gt; my
&gt;  &gt;life. N.A.D.A. recognizes the real value of our buses now. For those that
&gt;  &gt;don't know N.A.D.A. is like kelley blue book and is what insurance
&gt;  &gt;companies, dealers set the selling and insured values of our buses at.
&gt;  &gt;According to NADA my 15 window is worth 6100 low and 14100 finished, my
&gt; DC
&gt;  &gt;4525 low and 11950 high, my DD panel 4300 low and 11150 high and my westy
&gt;  &gt;5920 low and 14550 high. So it appears that the Westy camper is the most
&gt;  &gt;valuable of all model buses. All these prices are for 1960 buses and the
&gt;  &gt;book goes back to 1956. They value a 1956 Deluxe at 16400.  All these
&gt; prices
&gt;  &gt;come from a survey of what has sold, insurance companies , etc.
