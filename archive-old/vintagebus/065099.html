&gt; &gt;   Also on another note, Toyota is coming out with a new car (to compete in
&gt; &gt; the PT Crusier market) called the Scionion or something like that. The
&gt; &gt; reason I bring this up is it looks just like a Fridolen!!

So does the Honda Element:

The &quot;2-box&quot; design is currently hot with Japanese designers

The functionality of the Element seems to be getting back to that of the
bus, though the interior space isn't even close.  Still, the wife (who
isn't exactly in the &quot;male Gen Y demographic&quot; the car is aimes at) is
interested.
