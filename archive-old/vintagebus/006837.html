The cover I think you are talking about is a pressed snap on cover to cover
the mechanical sender units on early type 1's pre 67, not to cap off the
sender hole,

ronnie

ps Uncle Jerry needs a sender unit

Subject: [VB] Gas Tank Cover Plate


List:

I'm getting the gas tank from the '59 Westy ready to paint.  The original
owner had a guage installed I believe in '62 or '63, when that modern
advancement came out.  I've yanked the guage, and now want to dispose of
(donate, trade, sell) the sender.  I was looking in my parts book and there
apears to have been a part, part #111 201 571, Cover- Tank Unit Opening.  I
always figured pre gas gauge buses had a gas tank without a hole in it for
the sender.  I mean, what purpose is the hole for, cleaning it out?

Can anyone confirm or deny this hole cover?  If there is such a monster, I'd
like to acquire one.  If anyone has one for sale, trade, etc. please let me
know.  I'll trade you a nice sender for it.

TIA.

Robert
