Subject: Re: [VB] Buying bus parts

Wow, that sounds exactly like what I said to the bug shop when trying
to get the thermostat parts I had never seen but knew I needed...

Probably I shouldn't be allowed to hold a wrench, but nobody from VW
is around to stop me.

Have a great weekend everyone.

if you'd call someplace and be like &quot;i need the
thing that fits around that round thing on the front of thething with
the
square looking............&quot; i think you should not be alowed to hold a
wrench.
