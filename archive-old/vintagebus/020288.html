A high-end performance accessory for your vintage Volkswagen.  Obviously
someone here is NOT driving a Type-R split!

Bus content: scanning of the local manufacture tools manual starts tommorrow
in earnest -- school's out for, like, almost a week!  I think everyone will
really dig this new addition to the doc project.  Work is also going on to
bring back the PDFs and tar.gz collections, although on slow(!) links.

My '67 Westy has new curtains.  And one less gear box is leaking (victory one
step at a time).  All of the synthetic oil is staying in the engine where it 
belongs, and the oil filter keeps it clear.  The front shocks have become
noisy (squeaky) after the miles so I'll be replacing them after all, I've got 
new ones lying in wait.  May as well do the backs too.  I'm going to be using
gas-charged KYBs in the back and regular old Cofap shocks in the front.  The
bus has done very well without me doing much to it except putting gas in and
checking the oil...lots of freeway driving in the GA heat and humidity, so far
haven't missed a beat!  A big change for the guy who used to hold up caravans
burning up generators and voltage regulators on every single trip.  &lt;g&gt;

I should really update the rest of my VW pages with new stuff since it's been
nearly a year(!) the Westy really does look different with tires, tranny, 
engine, etc :-)  My best friend was down from school for a few days, and he
remembered how it used to be.  His jaw hit the floor when I picked him up in
the bus!
