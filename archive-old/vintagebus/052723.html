Thom's site says this bus was built in October of 1957 for the 1957 model
year and that a &quot;correction&quot; in the database was suggested.  While doing
bodywork, the stampings on the panels are dated august 56.  There is no M
code plate which I believe was used in '58.  I guess my other question here
is, what year did VW start using the &quot;model year&quot; as opposed to a
january-january year? Could this bus have been a special-order model '57
which took a bit longer to produce hence the '58 registration?

  Dan,

  I believe Thom's site gives you month by month the production of each
serial #.  That is where I found out that my bus was made in Feb of 56 and
was one of the last Wolfsberg busses.  Check it out at Vintagebus_dot_com.

  Good luck,
  Jim Cahill
