i went out today to my local junkyard and went out looking at some bugs and 
squarebacks that they have,when i ran accros a bug that must have gotten 
flooded during the storm,but the exaust looked almost new.so i went and 
removed it and brought it home.had to wire brush it down a lil and low and 
behold it is a EMPI  4 tip exust similer to a monza style exaust but not as 
loud.it looks really good on the bus and sounds good to.now i am not ashamed 
of the way my bus sounds like now.you know how those pea shotters sound like 
when they are rusted out and leaking.and i have some new found power 
now,lol.now i can hear all the rattles in my naked interior in my poor empty 
11 window.

talk to ya'll later
