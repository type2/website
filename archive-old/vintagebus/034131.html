VWhoward and me (ronnie) will be at both Kelly Park and Bug-a-Ripoff, look
for the Green (howards) double door panel and Ronnie's (sealing wax brick)
double door camper, they make a nice color contrast next to each other. 

ronnie

ps. maybe we can park next to Thom and put on a colorful disply, or how bout
getting all the d/d together at Kelly
