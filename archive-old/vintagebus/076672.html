Subject: Re: [VB] 10 digit serial number

Well, didn't they go to the 10 digit system in 1970?   so consider the last 7 digits just the serial number, the first 3 give the info.   

205,
 type 2 (yup, it's a transporter)
model 0  (maybe means Fleetline?)
year  5   so it's a 75.  


that's my guess.

&gt; Hi
&gt; I am trying to determine the year model for a South African Fleetline.
&gt; The chassis number is 205 3000 155.  Ive tried the vintagebus_dot_com
&gt; registry, but nothing there.  I believe these VWs were 
&gt; shipped to South
&gt; Africa from Brasilia as SKDs.
