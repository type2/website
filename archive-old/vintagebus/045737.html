Hey Clara--

My bus did actually come w/ the original crankstart apron. The layers of 
paint were the same as on the bus ALL the way (7 coats) down to the Sealing 
Wax Red! But, the original crank apron (which is sitting in my garage) along 
w/ the entire back end was pretty tweaked so I am using a replacement 
crankstart apron (which for the vintage-nazi's is correct for my vehicle!) 
along w/ a new back bumper, decklid, right corner, and hatch because the PO 
loved his sawzall along w/ flared wheel wells. It also has a split-case 
tranny, but will now feature a 1600dp (the 36'er never made it to my 
garage:(). 

If interested check out the before pic on thom's sites gallery:)
