&gt;&lt;&lt; My rear wheel brake bleeder valve is sheared off. Any recommendations? Can

&gt;machined out. Can I still bleed the rest of the system and adjust the
&gt;spindles on them all.  &gt;&gt;


How about just replacing the wheel cylinder?  By the time the bleeder valve
is rusted in place, the wheel cylinder is pretty old anyway.
