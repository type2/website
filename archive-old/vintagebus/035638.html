&lt;&lt; I have to agree with Jim.  Check out the pictures of the bus in question
 again (sorry I don't have the address).  If the bus in question were a
 panel, should'nt it have had the upper cargo vents along the sides.  The
 bus that was pictured looked like a kombi to me....no vents evident. 
 Just a thought.

Hi Steve,
Do not know the bus in question that you guys are talking about, but walk
through panels have no upper rear vents.         Eric &amp; Barb
