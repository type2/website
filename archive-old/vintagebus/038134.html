&lt;&lt; try attaching the wires together and see if that makes them work. (key on) 
 
 if it does your switch is bad.  if it doesn't see if you have power at one 
of 
 the wires- they are the same colour so check both, one should be hot with 
 ignition on.   If not you have to trace it above there- fuses ok?

    Connecting them together didn't make them come on. One wire is hot. 
 
 ...jump a hot wire from the battery to the taillight terminals.  if no 
 lights, then maybe you have a bad ground or bad bulb holder or bad bulb or 
 combination of these.   I like the bay window bulb holders with push on for 
 extra ground, works better.
 
  &gt;&gt; 
    the signal/brake light works on both sides when I jump a hot from the 
tail light terminal. I re-grounded both tail lights yesterday. bulb holders 
took some tweaking (one push on one screw on) but both will light up the 
bulbs now.  

    When I was testing the wires at the relay the front drivers side turn 
signal suddenly started working, not consistant in speed but it works. still 
no rear or drivers front turn signals or brake lights.  
    Does anyone have any suggestions on the best way to clean the screw 
terminals at the fuse block? I got them a bit cleaner but there has to be a 
better way.
mineral spirits?
