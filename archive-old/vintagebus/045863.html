&lt;&lt; what small town do you live in that has a DOZEN splitties driving around? 
 i'm the    only one in nashville that i've seen that actually drives. i know 
 a guy who has about six, but it's mainly just me and him, as far as i know. 
 i'm not doubting you, i was just curious. &gt;&gt;

living in eugene OR. I see as many as 6 splits driving around regularly, and 
a few others on occasion, I know of well over 20 non runners. so many bays I 
wouldn't even start to count. lots of &quot;hippies&quot; too.
