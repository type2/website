to play a concert and camp out. cool story. If you need a touring drummer 
call me.

&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; what did the tv reporter call you?  &quot;mayor of hippy town&quot; or some such?

 He called me the Honorary Mayor of the Volkswagen Village or something like 
 that.  As far as the article in VW Trends, nobody said anything to us about 
 it, it was a complete surprise.  And about being a celebrity, I WAS on the 
 front page of the Havasu Paper, don't forget. (
