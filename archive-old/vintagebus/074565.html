Subject: Re: spare five minutes...

From: Jim Ellis &lt;ellisjames_at_yahoo_dot_com&gt;
&quot;...negotiating over how the collective spare five minutes of family 
time is spent. I am starting to understand how these buses end up as 
neglected storage units.&quot;

My wife has absolutely no problem with me working on the Vanagon 
because it is our second car. The way I look at it is that it is a Type 
2 in disguise, and I get to continue poking around under the guise of 
doing the &quot;right thing.&quot;

And yes, my bus is a storage unit - it is full of all the parts I've 
bought for it. ;-) I am finally getting around to putting pictures up 
on my site and am in talks with a &quot;restoration artist&quot; to help me start 
putting things back together and on the road.
