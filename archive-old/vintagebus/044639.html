Everything I have said to the list I have previously said to Joe.  

I'm glad, as I said before, that there are others out there who have had
better experiences than me.  However, just because you had a good experience
with Joe does not translate into Joe treating everyone in the same manner as
he treats you.

If I am about to spend $500+ I think it would be justified to be able to have
a few questions answered - politely.  Answering questions - stupid or
otherwise - is a cost of doing business.  If you don't want to answer the
questions don't expect the business. 

This list is about sharing experiences and knowledge.  This is what I have
done.  You may not (obviously not) agree with me.  Which is fine with me.  If
you have have other experiences, fine, share them.  But be big enough not to
attack me because I relate mine.

&lt;&lt; Sure, Joe's a ol' crusty Italian who came out of retirement
 to do this- so what??  Deal with it, get a life, drive on, but 
 don't talk like that about someone behind their back. Thats 
 just as rude as what you are claiming he was to you.  He 
 isn't even on the list so he can defend himself.   &gt;&gt;
