Subject: Greetings to the list

Howdy All,

After a couple of back to back '71 campers, I just picked up a '58 single
cab.  Sold my '71 (sniff) after 8 years of trusty service.  Even drove it to
jerome in 00 from Boulder CO.  

Now I have this old critter to learn about.  It has the identical motor of
the old bus, a 1600 dp, stock carb and 009 dizzy.  It has the newer back end
with the 67 reduction boxes (big nut tranny, right?) Straight body, super
sweet front end (tracks like it is on rails) and beat paint.

Two problems to deal with:
1) generator light does not function.  Generator seems to work fine, but how
can I test it with it in the truck?  I put a meter on the generator posts
with the truck running and the lights on and got like 14.5 volts.  Seems
like it is charging fine?  What is the next step to fix that light?  No
loose wires behind the dash...

2) Set up with non-stock exhaust.  has extractor style pipes coming to a
single point in back of motor and has a single muffler hanging off with more
holes than metal.  What do people think of extractor mufflers, dual vs
single mufflers vs changing it all back to stock for the 1600 motor?  I am
not a stock purist, I want what is best for a long lifed motor.  I would
like thhe heat to work well too, so if that is a reason to choose one over
the other.

3) I've read the archives on driving with reduction gearing.  Any other
advice out there?  This rig cruises along at the recommended 50 mph with
virtually no gas.  Seems like there is sooooo much there...
What is wearing if driven faster...is it spinning the reduction gears too
fast and burning them up or is it spinning the motor at too many rpms?  I'm
not a speed demon but 60 would be sweet....

thanks for the input!
Wes and the un-named '58 truck
