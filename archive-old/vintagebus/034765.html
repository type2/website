Is this the early 59 with the split case tranny?  THat has a row of bolts 
holding the halves toigether like the engine does?  

or the kind with sections from end to end?  
they are different.

DO wait and get the Bentley so you can look at the pics and read what is 
going on it there.

popular wisdom says leave the tranny to the folks who know how to do it and 
have the special tools and can dance the special jigs.  But I know someone 
who fixed a trans from popping out of 4th.

has this bus been sitting a while?   if it sat with low fluid it would have 
rust on the gears and makes noise.  That noise can be quieted done somewhat 
by just changing the fluid and driving.  Different noises can mean bad 
bearings, and obviously I didn't hear your noises.

beg borrow steal or order a bentley asap.

however, if you are dealing with a split case tranny, the 63 edition WILL NOT 
cover it, as they were used 59 and earlier. in which case you need the 55 
ediytion (would have to check, but think the 59 ed was post split case/36hp)

&lt;&lt; Hello all....
 
 I am in need of some assistance via private mail or list. I removed the
 engine (code AH) from my 59 panel as well as the transmission.
 
 I need to get inside the case. All the bolts are off but it doesn't appear
 to be coming apart without what feels like excessive force. How do I take
 apart the transmission. 
 
 Why am I doing this?
 
 No one in town will touch the transmission. Not even the local VW guru. I
 was told to send it somewhere in California. 
 I pulled the drain plugs out and about 1/4 cup if that of fluid came out.
 Obviously this bus experienced a major episode of fluid loss, heat
 build up and what not and really sounds bad if you try and drive it:)
 It does shift and move in all gears.
 
 Right now although it can be transformed into a nice bus, I'm sort of
 feeling like I purchased a chicken coup but that is ok. So long as I can
 sit all proud and putt around proud one day all is still good.
 
 Other discoveries and work done thus far.
  
 - pulled apart reduction boxes all are ok.
 - seperated tranny from engine
 - noticed flywheel on engine had dented tooth sides but all edges are
 square
 - noticed metal shavings where engine has machines the tranny case a
 little.
 - 
 
 Why can't I look at the bently? I'm trying to get one ordered for less
 than 160 cdn dollars:) in any condition. I'm not trying to be cheap but
 getting this thing rolling out of my friends garage is of fairly high
 importance. heh. I'll be ordering up a book from somewhere next week.
 
  So....
 
 1. I need to be told how to seperate the case w/o breaking anything.
 -so I can check for obviously busted bits, excessive play, and clean this
 thing up before filling it with fluid if it appears to be fine. Also I
 have a second transmission of the same type that could use the same
 treatment and analysis for donor parts.
 
  2. don't laugh too hard guys.

 ...again pardon the poorly written email. I'm definately living the
 cartoon scenario in the idiots guide with parts everywhere. 8|
