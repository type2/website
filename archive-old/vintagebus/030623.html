That is a 68 to 72? Westfalia tent.  It will work on basically any year
bus.  Yup....any bus with a rain gutter will work.  That's because it
attaches with a rubber lip that grips to the rain gutter of the bus.  It
really is designed for sliding door bay busses though.  There is a pocket
that the door slides into I think.  No big deal though as many people use
these with the split busses.  A correct tent for your 66 (if it  is a Westy
) would have a internal frame and be a bit different.  Talk to Jim about the
differences.  He has the correct one.
