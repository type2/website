&lt;&lt; Hi List,
 
 I checked my parts book and it shows 'bullet' front turn signals in amber as
 pn 211 953 161. When I searched the BusDepot on line catalogue for that pn
 it returned me a pair of turn signals which were  supposed to fit all the
 way to '67.
 
 The WCM catalog does the same. I thought that 'bullets' went the way of the
 dodo in '63. Am I correct in this assumption?
 
 Later

that 211 953 161 is listed as the turn signal lens (yellow) up to chassis # 1 
144 281  (-meaning pointy.   

(111 953 161 is the pointy lens in white/clear)

211 953 161A lens
flashing indicator -left is the fried egg (no yolk) up to 1 144 281 (and 
italy from 1 144 282)

211 953 161B is the fried egg w/yolk - from ch 1 144 282

but if you read the search by part number bit in the busdepot website, it 
says enter no suffix letters, just the 9 digit p/n and it will bring up 
everything that fits.   what comes up when you type in that p/n is the B 
version- fried eggs.  listed with the B suffix and it says used on 62-67.    
they do not have the pointy yellow lens listed in the catalog
