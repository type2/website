Subject: Re: Bus Roof Sections

I've replaced quite a few roof sections and have a 8 page list of
instructions and pictures. It can be done in a weekend if you have the
right tools. Old section off Sat. and new section on Sun. You can get
the 3 belly pan pieces from repo suppliers. Send your address and three
32 cent stamps and I will mail them to you. If you have any ????? email
or call me.
