&lt;&lt; Depending on brand (Eber. or SW), condition, type (for bug, bus, type 3,
 thing), style (under dash or engine compartment) completeness (are all the
 parts there?).  A good working bus heater with all the parts should be
 worth $150-$400.  But if is for a bug, I wouldn't pay that much unless you
 have a bug &gt;&gt;

I have a friend who uses a eberspacker from a type IV to heat his garage.  
(yes, the exhaust goes outside)     with propane costing twice what it did 2 
months ago, he has a point.   probably because they make propane from 
electricity?  it is condensed electricity, right.  which is why it is in 
those pressurized bottles.

however, it is extremely rare to find all the parts.   the heater and the 
ducting for hot air yes, but the cables and switches from up front- good 
luck.  those are not included.  exhaust pipes maybe.
