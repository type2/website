I use a deep socket that's the appropriate size.

&gt;Just being nit picky, but people should not be needing to press the
bearing in
&gt;or out.  The races, yes.  The actual bearings themselves, no.  You don't
really
&gt;need to have someone press them (races) in.  You can do that with a
special tool
&gt;(bearing race/ seal installer from Eastwood) and a hammer.
