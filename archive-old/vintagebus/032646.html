URGENT LEGISLATIVE ALERT

California Bill to Destroy Pre-1970 Cars Awaits Floor Action in Assembly

	A bill (A.B. 1390) that would allow carmakers to crush pre-1970 vehicles in
exchange for credits toward their obligations under the state뭩 Zero
Emission Vehicle (ZEV) program is moving quickly through the legislature.
The bill is currently awaiting final action on the Assembly floor!

Contact Your Assembly Legislators Immediately To Oppose this Bill

  A.B. 1390 provides flexibility to auto manufacturers at the expense of
automotive hobbyists.

  A.B. 1390 provides no means by which to verify emissions reductions from
vehicles destroyed by this program.

  A.B. 1390 makes no provisions for rescuing valuable parts and parts-cars
for repair and restoration projects.

  A.B. 1390 fails to recognize that pre-1970 cars are typically second or
third vehicles rarely driven in the first place.

  A.B. 1390 ignores the fact that lower income car owners often cannot
afford to purchase new or even newer used vehicles with the money provided
by this program.

Contact your state legislators to oppose A.B. 1390.  Protect vehicle
enthusiasts and collectors in California. To find out who your Assembly
legislators are, contact the California Assembly뭩 information line at
916-445-2323.  This information can also be accessed via the Internet at
