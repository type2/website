waas writ:


you mean there are 4 bolts holding the motor to the tranny.(thought there were
only 3, duh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)

carrying to many parts is never enough...............................if it`s
bound to happen it will (right kyle).

reading some of these stories really scares the shit out of me  :)  Never
leave home without the trusty F**D.

I don't have a Ford, someone else can keep it, I'll take the trusty old VW.
And sometimes I leave out the top left tranny to engine bolt, so kill me,
never had a motor fall out yet.
