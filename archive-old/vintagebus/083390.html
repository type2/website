Subject: RE: [VB] wiper motor question

Thanks for the great pointers that folks sent me about my wiper motor problem.  It turned out to be a pretty easy fix.
 
When I picked it up from the inspection garage, I gave the wipers a try.  Actually, the problem wasn't that they weren't parking in the right place - they just weren't parking.  They stop cold when I turn off the switch.  I also noticed that the high speed position wasn't working.
 
So, I pulled the wiper switch out, and sure enough, two terminals were empty (one was the 53a that Mike said was the self-parking switch-off).  I cleaned off the terminals, found the loose wires, got out the wiring diagram, put the right wires in the right places, and sure enough, when I reconnected the battery, everything's copacetic.
 
I think I'll take Clara's advice, and go ahead and grease everything, now that I've got some time.
 
Russell
