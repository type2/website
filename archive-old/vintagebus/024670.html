&gt; &lt;&lt; Wolfsburg West told me theirs are NOS, not repros.  That surprised me
&gt;  because the color is not exactly the same as one I took off a Commercial Bus
&gt;  at the junkyard.  They also said they were almost out of them?

&gt; &gt;From what I have been told (by Charlie Hammil), Primer hubcaps are different
&gt; colors, there are red ones and grey ones, and the grey ones are shaded to the
&gt; bus's color.

  Dear Mike,
    I have been collecting gray primer hud caps for the past 6-7 years. I have a
collection of about 20. I was going to write an article on this topic.... but
......    You might ask why I am looking for a set of four when I have 20.   Well
Charlie Hammil is right ! I have 11 different shades of gray.   I can not put
four together to make myself a set.  These are all real VW ! These hub caps were
most likely painted the color of the day.  &quot; Yo ! Kurt run out and get some more
gray paint... we are almost out &quot;
