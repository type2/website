does that mean it's a double door or are there just cargo doors on the left
(driver's side) or is that a mistake?- - - -

no, not a double door.   The cargo doors (there are two, a forward and an aft)
are on the right.  Oh shoot I meant to say right.     That was a type.   You
could get a bus with the cargo doors just on the same side as the steering
wheel, I saw one (1).   awkward, if you ask me.   With cargo doors both sides,
VW would call it double doors right and left.   hope I confused you more.
