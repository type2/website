&gt;Uh What?  There is NO, as far as I've ever seen, an ALTERNATOR style pump
&gt;that uses a LONG pushrod.  But then again, some people are purchasing
&gt;inferior quality pumps from some suppliers and retail outlets, or are maybe
&gt;just installing the WRONG RODS FOR THE PUMP.  Since it really doesn't matter
&gt;if the engine is an alternatored or generated ENGINE, the only crucial thing
&gt;is the MATCHING OF THE ROD TO THE PUMP. Putting a long rod in an alternator
&gt;style PUMP will result in the rod inside the pump breaking or the diaphragm
&gt;tearing, while using a short rod in a generator PUMP will result in low or no
&gt;fuel pressure.
