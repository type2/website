re:holes
&quot;I have those same holes on my '65 kombi. they are for
a side tent, two
supporting poles go in the holes on the bumper, and
the two bracketsabove the
cargo doors attach to the tent pipes somehow. I almost
got it figuredout this
summer then realize i was missing some a couple pipes,
and never hadtime to
get them. I guess they are about teh same size pipe as
electricalconduit.&quot;

Kevin,
As a matter of fact, the frame assembly is nothing
more then electrical conduit, and all of the pieces
can be found at any supply house. The couplers holding
all the pieces together are standard coundiut couplers
with one bolt to perminetly tighten to one of the
sides and a 'wing' style bolt to make for easy
tightening with no tools needed for the other side.
