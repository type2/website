With a 67 being a dual circuit, the easiest method is to get an adapter kit
and buy a late model master cylinder. It's bigger than the stock and it's
replaceable!

Howdy Volks,
Does anyone know where I can find a rebuild kit for my
'67 master cylinder?  Does anyone even make these
anymore?  Everyone I've talked to says I would have to
buy a new one and I would rather not drop a couple
bills if I don't absolutely have to.  Thanks for the
advice in advance.
