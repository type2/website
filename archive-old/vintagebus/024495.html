Hi Kevin
I had to drill several out of my '67 when I did frames.  The trick it to
hit the center of the 
screw and use a drill bit smaller diameter than the threads of the
screw.  I think BFY has the 
screws (.25 ea).  Just be careful.  Even if you hit 1 or 2 slightly off
center you can still 
usually thread a screw into it.  There's several other screws holding it
together so it's not 
as much of an issue  as it would be if you had only 1 fastener.

Good luck.

Dave
