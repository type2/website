&gt; &lt;&lt; I have been using the foil covered insulation board for some years. It is
&gt;  simple to cut to shape, and by cutting vees on the inner side you can match
&gt;  curves and provide an unbroken vapor barrier to the sheet metal. &gt;&gt;
&gt; Hi Kyle,
&gt; We have not seen that product out here.  Is there a particular name for it?
&gt; The mor products to pick from the better!  Still we would use the tar first on
&gt; the sheet metal that would both protect against moisture in there and glue the
&gt; insulation in place.  Eric &amp; Barb

Now you're talking up my alley.  I converted my garage to use as an office and
have one of those hollow metal rollup doors.  They offer no sound or heat
insulation.  In the afternoons when the sun would beat down on the door, the
temperature in here would skyrocket.  I got a bunch of 4'x8' sheets of the 1&quot;
stuff and cut it to size and slid it into the voids of the garage door.  Its been
there since 1992 and not a complaint from me.

Its called Durasheath or Rmax and is carried by Home Depot.  They have a bunch of
different thicknesses as well.

A link to look at the stuff is
