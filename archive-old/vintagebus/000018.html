During my welding classes ( I will admit it was almost 20 yrs ago ) they told 
us that any time a fuel tank was to be welded, fill it with sand first. 

How do you get the sand out?  

When I was working at a radiator shop in California some years back, we used 
to hot tank gas tanks to clean them and we cut an &quot;X&quot; in one corner to get 
out the caustic liquid.  After that, we just used this huge iron (soldering 
iron - heated by a torch away from the tank) and soldered the hole shut.  
Much safer than welding if it's feasible for your repair.
