To the friendly and knowledgeable list members,

&quot;-doing a resto. Problem is I have NO interior pieces for it at all. So
if 
anyone has any extra correct interior, SO23??&quot;

My apology for jumping on this thread with selfish intent..BUT,-

Could we broaden it a bit to include what westy interiors are witch. what
archive searches to do, what web pages have the best explanations, spec.s
and pictures for our self education.
The westy club page is a little intimidating for me as a newbe. 

Another good thing to know would be, what post '67 camper parts are
adaptable to our splits?

My selfish intent would be that I'm going to cobble together a cheapo
conversion for my Kombi. Apology in advance for this bastardization of a
vintage bus but my beloved Kombi will never be a trailer/show queen.
