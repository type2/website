Subject: Aftermarket wheels on the Bus...

By spring I'd like to replace &quot;BAJA&quot; wheels that are on my Bus right now and was doing a little
research... I have searched and searched and searched and found many matches for Fuchs and Porsche
and EMPI but could not really find any information that I really need on those aftermarket wheels.
Questions are: which wheels are better?

Porsche originals or standard aftermarket (any parts store out there) - (I like the way Fuchs look
though);
Adapters? I have heard some bad about these coming loose;
Tire - rim size.... I don't want to go original size tire... would 205 be too much?

appreciate all the responses...
