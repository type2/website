Subject: clunking sound from fan

Hi all,
Since putting the 1600 back in, it seems the fan is hittting something in
its housing.  At very low idle, or right before it shuts off, I get a random
clunk, clunking sound back there.

While the motor was out, I replaced the generator, voltage regulator, and
starter.  I put everything back on as it came off, torqued the big nut to
spec, spun everything around and nothing was touching.  The strap is good
and tight, and fan belt is adjusted properly.  I didn't notice the noise
right away, but have driven 100 miles since, and the motor is starting and
running fine.  I took the fan belt off tonight, turned the generator and ran
engine for a minute - no clunking at all, thus the assumption it is fan
related.  My questions

1.  Did I miss something in the diagnosis I've done so far?
2.  Is there anything else to try with the engine in?
