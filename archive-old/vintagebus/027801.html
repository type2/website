&gt; On one of my roof racks, I was missing two clamps. There was a fellow

&gt; them or not. There has been no mention of himofrom other listees so I
&gt; presume he is no longer making them.

I bought the remainder of his clamps at the last Bug O Rama. They're the
&quot;horseshoe&quot; style. I have these repops, and some originals of the other
&quot;hook&quot; style for whoever needed them...........
