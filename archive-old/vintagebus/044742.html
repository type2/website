  I am now remembering having read something about re-tourquing the heads on 
the
 bus, I have no idea if the PO did this, I assume you need to pull the engine
 to do this?  &gt;&gt;

Hi Kevin,
When a engine is new or rebuild with about 300 miles on it one should remove 
the rocker arms and retorque the lower head bolts.  This can be done with the 
engine in the VW.
  After about 40,000 miles we like to remove the engine, take it down to a 
long block and retorque all the case and head bolts.  Except for our present 
1641SP CW crank engine, we have found the case fasteners on all our other 
engines needing quite alot of retorquing.  Even VW recommends this in the 
head repair section of the 63-67 bus shop manual.  In essense it reads that 
since you have torn the engine down so far as to repair or replace the heads 
you should retorque the engine case fasteners!   Eric&amp;Barb
