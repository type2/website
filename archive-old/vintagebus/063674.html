&gt; Two problems to deal with:
&gt; 1) generator light does not function.  Generator seems to work fine, but 
&gt; how can I test it with it in the truck?  I put a meter on the generator 
&gt; posts with the truck running and the lights on and got like 14.5 volts.  
&gt; Seems like it is charging fine?  What is the next step to fix that light?  
&gt; No loose wires behind the dash...

Hi Wes,
First remove the bulb and check it.  Next check the wire from the idiot light 
bulb holder to the idiot light sender for continuity.  Lastly check the 
regulator connection for grounding when engine off and not grounding when 
engine is running.

&gt; 2) Set up with non-stock exhaust.  has extractor style pipes coming to a 
&gt; single point in back of motor and has a single muffler hanging off with 
&gt; more holes than metal.  What do people think of extractor mufflers, dual vs 
&gt; single mufflers vs changing it all back to stock for the 1600 motor?  I am 
&gt; not a stock purist, I want what is best for a long lifed motor.  I would 
&gt; like the heat to work well too, so if that is a reason to choose one over 
&gt; the other.

Extractor muffler will make a stock engine run hotter unless the carb jetting 
is changed.  Stock will work fine unless you run a 1776 or bigger engine or 
are into running your engine well over 4,000 RPM.

&gt; 3) I've read the archives on driving with reduction gearing.  Any other 
&gt; advice out there?  This rig cruises along at the recommended 50 mph with 
&gt; virtually no gas.  Seems like there is sooooo much there...
&gt; What is wearing if driven faster...is it spinning the reduction gears too 
&gt; fast and burning them up or is it spinning the motor at too many rpms?  I'm 
&gt; not a speed demon but 60 would be sweet....

For us 3,000 RPM is top cruising RPM, especially during warm weather any 
higher and the engine oil temp tends to push too close to the 230F limit.  In 
weather over 80F we have had to slow down a few MPH to keep poil temp below 
220F.  Higher than 230F cooks the oil into a lesser lubricating state and 
engines tend to last less than 40,000 miles instead of 80,000.  Also when we 
went from driving at 3,800RPM (55MPH) to 3,000RPM (47MPH) our 40 HP big bore 
engine went from 19 MPG to 27 MPG.  Now have a 3.875 R&amp;P freeway flier and CW 
1641 SP and getting about 21MPH _at_ 58 MPH.
