&gt; I'm watching America's Most Wanted right now... A story about the Grateful
Dead caught my eye.  I thought it was gonna be about the band, but it turns
out it was about that girl - Sativa that owned the bus and was murdered.
The murder at the truck stop. Sad story...  Very wierd how i'm watching it
on tv now though. Anyone else catch it?&lt;

Yes, I caught most of it except the very beginning.  I thought AMW did a good job recreating the story from what I read on her investigation website.  I caught this show on pure accident, but told my wife about the story a while back and she thought the show was good also.

Hopefully this will help bring the guilty to justice to pay with their lives.  I know it is controversial to say, but this was cold blooded murder and whoever did this deserves to die.

Also Bob Weir was interviewed which was neat.  They mentioned the bands that have replaced the Dead for the traveling set is Phish and One Eyed Jack.  I am not familiar with One Eyed Jack, are they good?

Check out the AMW website for more info.
