I just found out that some parts I needed won't be at my house until next
week.  I really had my heart set on working on my bus this weekend to
utilize my time.  What is holding my WHOLE front end rebuild project up is
those grease seals that go between the 67 bus axle beam and the suspension
arms (these are located at the ends of the axle tubes.)  I've emailed Omahan
and KC listees but thought I would poll the list (VintagVW and VintageBus)
to see if anyone has them new.  I'm not so desperate that I'll accept used
ones though.  If anyone has them, I'm willing to drive the distance to pick
them up so I can at least use Sunday to make some progress.

Thanks!
