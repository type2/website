&lt;&lt; What I dont get is why  the push rods did that- could the valves have

what goes on? &gt;&gt;
Hi Clara,
Definitely could be due to that!  Blocking off the heaters cooling air from 
the fresh air shroud pushes up the temp on the #1 &amp; #3 cylinders.  Bet it got 
so hot the valves siezed for a short while and when it cooled they loosened 
back up.  Seen the same thing with a low mileage 58 bus that some kid got up 
and running.  He pushed it up to 60 MPH against our warnings to keep below 50 
MPH to get to a VW show and ended up with the tranny locking up when he 
pulled up and stopped in the show area.  He had to have it carried back home 
on a tow truck, when it got home the tranny had cooled and unstuck by then.
