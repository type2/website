Subject: RE: [VB] That 70s show bus

Yeah,

I was a little baffled, I didn't notice it roll down but I though maybe the 
FX guys got lazy and the rear window was absent in that scene all together.  
Who knows.  Maybe there r 2 splitties being used in that 70s show?

&gt;
&gt;In the Electroglide movie..
&gt;Did you notice the hippy roll down the rear window and blast that cop with 
&gt;the rusty shotgun for trying to return his license?  Wonder how they rigged 
&gt;that.
