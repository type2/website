Hi All,

I'm sitting here doing my weekly radio show where I play an hour of world
music and thought I would share this with you all...
(next hour I do alternative bands you'll never hear again and then onto an
hour of techno/rage).

Right now, I'm playing 'Italian Musical Odyssey'.  They offer a great
selection of music from all over.  Most of the titles on their home page
I've played and are all good.  Enjoy!

David
