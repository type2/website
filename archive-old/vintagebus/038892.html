Subject: RE: [VB] Resealing Picture Window?

I used the 3M window sealer, comes in a role, black and very sticky, they use it
to set new car windows, like roofing tar on a role. the diameter is too thick
and you have to stretch it a little. I've used it quite a bit, used it to seal a
front window on a comercial fishing boat.
