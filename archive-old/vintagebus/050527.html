Subject: VW Tool Needed

I am looking for a VW 401 press tool. It is a steel plate with multiple
cut-outs for many different types of press removal/installation procedures.
I'd prefer not to pay the extremely high new price for one, but would
rather have a used one in very good condition.  I could use one right now
to re-assemble a few sets of bus kingpins. Every Bentley/VW service manual
has many pictures of it, as it is used in many different applications. ANY
leads or if you just happen to have a few extras laying around, please let
me know. Thanks!

Also, I think I have found a source for the correct sized, straight flute
center pin hand-reamer. I have ordered one and will be doing a center pin
soon, possibly by the New Year. It is German made and meets all the
specifications set down in the Bentley and official 1959 VW Transporter
Service Manual that I have, as far as dimensions go. It isn't cheap, but
I'll have a source for those who are interested (you can p-mail me for more
details). Results to follow at a future date.
