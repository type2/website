Subject: Re: [VB] 12V generator bearings anyone???

Geez! That's sounding *serious* there! Actually there was a break this
weekend in the rain, and I removed the belt, and ran the engine a bit, and
the whine is still there at speed. I felt around to the front of the fan
housing, and the fan didn't feel loose - neither was there excessive play
in the generator axle. So I'm wondering if internal bearings could be
causing the occasional whine at speed and while accelarating. Can you hear
bad crank bearings whining from outside the block? It's there without the
tranny in gear as well as with. There's about 75000 miles on the block -
the heads/Ps/Cs I replaced about 22000 ago. At that time, the sideplay of
the conn rods was in spec as was endplay. Endplay was also in spec (004)
in November (1200 miles ago).
