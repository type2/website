&lt;&lt; Does anyone have a set of overriders that will fit '66 blades? What can I
expect to pay? The whole set, not including the blades, from BFY is about
$300. What year did the overriders begin and was this just a US spec? &gt;&gt;
Hi Josh,
That is one of those open questions that are hard to ansewer.  It can easily
depend where you are to what parts cost.  Hopefully you do not live in
Austrailia, England, Canada where importing stuff is painfull $ due to import
taxes.  Also what are you looking for, NOS, good used, or dinged and dented
that you can pound out?  You could literally pick up each piece for a buck
each by going from wrecking yard to wrecking yard and swap meet to swap meet
spending years looking for the right deal and pouncing when it is there.  Or
if you want NOS and now you are probably going to pay much much more.   For
our 1951 sunroof bug we looked for about two years for pan pieces to repair
our passenger rear battery section.  Found a full pair of pan halfs covered
with surface rust for the split for $10.00 at a swap meet.  Offered the one
side we did not need to a friend of ours who had not only sold us not only a
lot of parts for the bug at good prices, but also the bug itself.  We told
him how much we had gotten the pan half for and since he wanted the spare pan
half to make a good deal for himself by just offering us what he wanted to
trade for it.  He traded $250.00 of split window bug parts for it and both of
us where quite happy.  Eric&amp;Barb
