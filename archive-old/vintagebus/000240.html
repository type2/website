what would you rather do change the VIN number in it Or have the MaN take it 
away cause it was stolen 6 years ago and you bought it not knowing this.  I'm 
not trying to be a criminal or anything.  but,  you gotta do whatcha gotta do 
to keep your car.  So if you need it fine if you don't then don't get on my 
back for tryin to HeLp a brother out.
