Hi list
I posted to a Ghia list about the 40 horse engine that I was playing
with. I told them I'd swap for bus parts. 
Looking at the flywheel end (were the enormous end play is) I noticed
that there was something leaking out back. Probably something leaking out
he gland nut flywheel seal, water, oil, whatever, accumulated  in all the
time it was setting.
If the gland nut has worked it's way loose would that cause end play?
When I tug on the crank pulley I get the same amount of play. What causes
excessive end play?
aloha
Ken
