&gt;
&gt;Im cross posting this to both lists because i figure we are all vws buddies
&gt;and as we all know it that quite the majority of buses came with 40hp. Plus
&gt;im more of a bus kinda guy even though i have a bug But enough with my
&gt;complexes:)
&gt;
&gt;My stock rebuilt 40hp is very strong. But my paranoia(The gex is out 
&gt;there!)
&gt;is getting to me. Im running stock 6volt stuff and 28 pict one carb. Now 
&gt;the
&gt;gex heads are really driving me off the rail. I think there going to go. 
&gt;Now
&gt;as far as finding forty horse heads i got the gex heads in the car right 
&gt;now
&gt;and it runs great. So could i get the Gex heads Re-re built locally?
&gt;(Vancouver B.C) Quite a few competant VW shops hanging around. Or would it
&gt;be worth it to scour out a pair of german heads and get those  rebuilt by 
&gt;rimco or by a higher more reputible company? Another idea that a
older vw guy told me is that i could use 65 and up 40 hp heads they have one
more fins. Im not going for complete stock here people. So if any of you
shave any heads that might help me out Drop me a line. Also Do any of you 
know
any of the 1200cc Formula Vee Guys? Or you might be one. In Any cause. If
Ronnie From the Old Volks Home fame. Im probably going to be talking to
you soon.
That Young VW Guy. &quot;Hey!! Just because im the youngest guy owning a
vw hear does not mean im not worthy!:)&quot;Kirin Jacobsen Ladner B.C !962 bug.
