Just a short note of thanks to the couple of list members that identified my
noise coming from the back brake. It was a loose clip holding the emergrncy
brake cable arm. As a result, this arm had more movement than normal causing
the noise.

......I have overalls and a couple of moving blankets stored in my bus in
case of breakdown. I fully expect to have my estate sell the bus with these
in NOS condition.

No.....my bus is not mechanically perfect!! I am more likely jump right in
and discover later that my newer jeans and t-shirt are now dirty. Geee.... I
should have changed!

200 messages on the Vanagon list.... go there too. Lately, there always
seems to be a few of the members flaming each other over some percieved
slight (real and/or imagined). Mildly entertaining, but hitting the delete
button is simpler. The other thread is on tire choice... okay for the
newbies.... but I know by memory the majority response is Michelins. Anyway,
drop about 50 off the 200 for my interests.

I jump into this list from time to time, but maybe &quot;lurk&quot; more than I
should........
