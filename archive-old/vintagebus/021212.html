Subject: re:Dangerous Brakes!

a few years ago, my father in law was enroute from san
diego to yuma,az in his '62pan/'70body baja bug.he
stopped at a rest area 8miles west of el centro, with
no indication of any brake problems. after a quick
rest, he drove to el centro, exited the freeway to get
fuel. the single circuit '62 type brakes lost a wheel
cylinder, down the off ramp he went, quickly,
attempted a right turn at 50mph? and rolled the car
three times. he came away with a scratch on his elbow
(you gotta love a bugs structural design!). i built
him another baja bug, this one got brand new '68
everything for brakes. my wife's '66 deluxe got brand
new '67 everything from ronnie. $150.00 for a dual
circuit master cylinder, doesn't seem like much, for
brake security to me. so much is written here, about
how great vws engineering is, &quot;stock is superior&quot; etc.
and many people futz with/modify/re-engineer/cheap out
on the one system, that if it fails, it can kill you
and others. i am pleased to hear that all survived
their bouts with brake failures, fix 'em right!
