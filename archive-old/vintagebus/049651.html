Yeah, they emailed me about a part I asked the bay list about (NLA: SH*T);
I wrote them and told them that was A+ in my book...
I am ALL FOR having another vendor, so I think anyone else who has a GOOD
experience with BB should post to that effect,  and encourage them to
rectify their bad (former?) rep.

For the record, I have had GOOD experiences with:
Bus Depot
Wolfgang
Ronnie
Jim Thompson
 and many other plain ol List members.
I look forward to having a good experience w/ Bus Boys some day.............
