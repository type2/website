&gt; Hullo, list.

&gt; After owning Patience for a year and a half I am pulling the engine (my first)
&gt; to do a myriad of things.
&gt;
&gt; The main reasons are to chase down a persistent oil leak on the left side
&gt; (guessing oil cooler on the 1600dp), get Time-Serts put in the #2 and #3
&gt; sparkplug holes, putting in new engine tin seals, and put in air flaps in the
&gt; fan shroud.
&gt;
&gt; &quot;While I'm at it,&quot; I am planning pressure washing it, on getting new exhaust
&gt; valves put in (no idea as to the old ones' mileage -- no stretching yet),
&gt; checking on the existence of a Hoover bit, flushing the oil cooler, check on
&gt; the clutch, checking the endplay, and replacing the crankshaft seals.
&gt;
&gt; Can anyone recommend some other common items I should check on or do &quot;while I'm
&gt; at it?&quot;

Look at all the tin with a jaundiced eye.  Any cracks should be brazed up.
You will probably find cracks on the cylinder tin.  Brazed tin very seldom
requires any further repairs, as the cracking will relieve stresses and
the brazing process will tend to anneal the metal.

Also check the heater
boxes, particularly around where the pipe goes in and out.  If the housing
is loose, make some split collars out of sheet metal and braze them around
the pipe to increase the bearing surface.

Replace all the engine bay seals, of course.
