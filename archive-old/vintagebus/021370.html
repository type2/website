I think the count was over 100, but not by much.
I only saw two sets of safari windows sitting at hornies spot at the end of 
the day so it seems as though the majority of them sold.
I think dave heard needs to take lessons from octo on event organization.
They waited till like 1PM until anyone even got on the microphone to talk.....
I liked that octo had stuff going on ALL DAY.
Yesterday dragged out, and it was hot.....everyone flocked torwards shade.
I dont know how they afforded veterans stadium.......I couldnt imagine it 
being cheap.
Cool that it was a free meet.
I also headed down to San Diego to check out some locals recently aquired 
busses, a *MINT* condition 35K mile 61 kombi in a garage for 30+ years parked 
on jackstands.......WOW!!!!!!!!!
I took a drive in a *****NICE**** 65 firetruck....that bus drives like its 
BRAND NEW!!!!!
I was amazed, It is also currently for sale on the VW planet website. Too 
cool.
Stopped by a fellow listees house to check out a 56 westy I was trying to 
talk him out of. I like it ****ALOT****.
Supposedly my dual carbed 36 horse hotrod motor is almost finished......the 
57 frankenstandard is leaving my garage this week for the first time in 11 
months.
Should be driving in no time!!!!!!
Greg-
57 franknestandard.....
looking for a brakelight decklid westy subhatch.


The *SOMEWHAT NICE* ones were 700$ per set and the &quot;DECENT&quot; ones were 500$ 
per set.

&lt;&lt;I'd say 75 to 110 busses attended.  Nothing to speak of at the swap except 
to stand back and watch all the regular vultures descend on every new swap 
arrival....great fun!  I especially love the guy with the mustache who is 
never shy about running around looking for things and then brings them back 
to plop them down at his space for twice the price...ah you gotta love free 
enterprise ;-)

Rennie (who I met for the first time) his lady and the weenie dog were around 
taking photos of listees busses as were Matt and Katie.  You didn't miss much 
other than the same old regulars.  I did see 6 sets of org. safari windows 
(sans glass) for sale....one of them sold.  I think they were above $600 a 
set...not sure though. No extra parts though :-(

I have to admit I bought a tee shirt only because it had a great pic of a 
pearl white DC on the back.  Commercial busses and trucks were &quot;featured&quot; so 
I got directed to &quot;this must be the front row!&quot; to park.  Big whoop ;-}

Better than going out to breakfast with the mother in law which I'd of had to 
do if I didn’t go.
