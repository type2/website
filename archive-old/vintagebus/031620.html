On the backup issue I want to be clear...

As with all my critical data, I have multiple tape and CD-ROM copies that I
have off-site (miles away) to greatly decrease the risk of such things.  I'm
not a computer newbie -- the risk of the data being lost forever was pretty
low :)

If consensus leans toward &quot;give them out, information is free&quot; -- My
thoughts were to offer some number (20?) free copies on CD-ROM and a limited
number for download (or maybe restrict the download time to middle of the
night to prevent my servers from being over-run!).

  Stephen

I'm all for it.  When I joined the list way back when, I knew from the
minute I posted that it was a public forum and that copies of my posts would
float around the net.

If we only allow certain websites or one main server to hold the archive and
it crashed, the posts are gone forever.  If they are out there floating
around on CD, chances are good the archives could be setup again should
something catastrophic happen.   I'm all for free distribution of
information.
