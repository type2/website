Subject: Re: [VB] Size of 58 Cab vs. later split windows...

JD -
 Seat Runners to make all the front seats adjustable were introduced in the
63 Model year (Vin 971 550), so this probably why yer a bit uncomfortable. I
had the same problem with a 61 Panel &amp; 59 Euro Single Cab PU I both use to
own. After a hunnert miles or so, time get out and stretch yer legs (I'm
5'9&quot;).
 Note: Adjustable Seat Runners were on the M80 &amp; M81 optional walk thrus
thru 1962.
 Now my ex-67 Deluxe 21 Wdw Walk Thru was such a pleasure to drive around
when I switched back and forth between the two at the time (86-93).

&gt; Would anyone know if the cab section or seat set up is any larger or
&gt; smaller than that of a later years split bus? Is it an issue of bench seat
&gt; versus walk-thru? I was wondering cause I just drove a 58 panel w/
benchseat
&gt; and I had a tough time driving comfortable as compared to my 67 walk-thru?
&gt; I'm 6'2&quot; so it is kind of an issue if I were to get this older bus....
&gt; Everything else sure seems cool though! Thanks! JD
