&gt; Subject: 23 window deluxe
&gt; Date: Monday, November 23, 1998 9:23 PM
&gt; 
&gt; Hello all,
&gt; 
&gt;     I need to get an idea of the value of a 1963, 23 window deluxe bus.
&gt; I
&gt; have looked around on the internet and been to several sites, but very
&gt; little info. was available on the value of these cars.  I turn now to
&gt; you guys.  The
&gt; bus is complete, a little rust, some dings, and a cracked window.  I
&gt; don't know much else.  83,000 miles, and original paint that looks nice.
&gt; 
&gt; Any info would be greatly appreciated!!
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you for your time,
&gt; Chris Russow
&gt; 


Virtually nothing, almost worthless, the guy must be destitute.

I'm interested in this kind of personality, please refer him to me 
IMMEDIATELY.  He needs my kind of help.

And by the way, let's keep this between us.  Let's not embarrass the
guy by talking about this matter with the rest of the list, until I have
relieved the poor soul of his heavy burden.

With a kind heart,

Cecil
