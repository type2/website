Subject: misc sightings

Just got back to Northern Calif. from vacation to Flathead Lake,
Montana. Travelled through northern Calif.; central Oregon; western
Washington; across panhandle of Idaho into western Montana. Saw *very*
VWs of any kind: less than 1/2 doz bays; a couple of bugs. On Monday
31st say a beeyouteeful splittie turning into rest area near St Regis MT
about noon. White over yellow with kayak or canoe on top. We flew by in
our oldsmobubble so didn't have time to stop. But what a sweet splittie.
If you're on the list, best to you.
