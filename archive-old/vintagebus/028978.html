I need to get one of my 54-55 round regulators rebuilt, does anybody know
of a place that can perform this feat?  My local generator rebuild place
said there used to be a place in Tucson, AZ but they went out of business.
 Apparently a wire broke internally in my generator and fried it.

Or if anybody has a NOS/New one, please let me know.

Visible in this pic for those wondering what it looks like:
