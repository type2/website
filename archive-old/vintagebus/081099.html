Subject: Parting out 67 Westy at EB

Hey,
Looks like some of my sales fell through so I'm bringing my 67 westy parts bus
to Everybus.  If you've emailed me about this one and I haven't responded I
apoligize.  I got a lot of emails and was waiting to see what actually went
through before I responded.
If you're interested in the shell and have not left yet bring a 2&quot; trailer
hitch and you can take her home for cheap.  The towbar will also be up for
sale.
Wheels, tires, tranny, drums, tierods, etc. all underneath look good and will
go with the shell.  Lots of good metal underneath too.
I still have the complete interior table, jump seat, zbed, icebox, guages,
lights, windows, electrical, original vw glass, bumpers, etc.
I don't normally like to clutter the digest with classified stuff, but I
thought in this case it might be good to give some folks a heads up about
bringing a way to tow.
Thanks.
Hope to see you there.
Mike
