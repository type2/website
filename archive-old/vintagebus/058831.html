Subject: RE: [VB] Any Kelly park updates ?

  If the new map is any indication of what's inside, there is room for less
then 50 swappers! I have been informed 2nd 3rd hand that if you want to be
guaranteed a swap spot buy a new vendor spot (I also heard they were sold
out). I was also informed that the San Jose police will be making any body
camped out in the street to move. So good luck to any or all that are going
to try and get it to show and/or swap.

Subject: [VB] Any Kelly park updates ?


Just wondering if they figured out where the swap meet was going to be and
if 
there is enough room for everyone in the swap ?

from the website 
http://www.ggcvvwca_dot_org/kelleypark2002.htm

it looks like the swap is  back inside the park , and thats not much room !

is that the  final decision ?
