It seems to us that there is some type of unwritten or unspoken contest to 
have the most rusty, incomplete and illegal bus on the road.
We have seen it year after year at Jerome. We had been under the impression 
that these derelict buses only were driven once a year to Jerome, but now 
they have another destination.
By the way Thom, we at the Transporter Restorations Shop, take offense to the 
Arizona comment. There are a few of us sun dwellers that have pushed the 
envelop on the restorations of early bugs ( Dick Christiansen) and Type 2's. 
Your right about 80% of the buses on the road, but that is about the same % 
you'll find anywhere. When we were in Nor-Cal we noticed an amazing number of 
Cal look beaters.
