When I brought my 66 camper home a couple of months ago, it had absolutely NO working lights.  Since then I have fixed headlights (loose connector), fixed tail lights brake lights &amp; turn signal (thanks again Matt R for the 9 prong box procedure), and fixed interior lights (I knew that little switch on the steering column did something!).  Now, the last NON-working lights, which may be the most important, that I need to fix are the Oil temp light, GENerator lights, and Speedo light.  The weather is getting warm and I would HATE to overheat my bus because the OIL light doesn't work.  Anyway, does anyone have any advice on where I should start troubleshooting for these lights, or can direct me to a good online article\procedure for getting these on???
