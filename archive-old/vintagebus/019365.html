Stop and look really carefully to see if the motor
housing is being amplified by riding on the defrost
tubes.

I have installed 12v 2speed wiper motors in just about
every splittie that I have owned. On occassion I had
to  diegrind a slight amount of metal from (off of)
the defrost heater air tubes on the inside of the V or
Y under the dash. &lt;earlier buses&gt; 57-63? guessing.
65,66,67 ought to be OK.
Grind just enough to keep the motor housing from
riding directly on these defrost tubes. I'm talking
SLIGHT amount of material on the folded seam. It's
underdash out of sight above the pkgtray etc. so to me
it was not a vintage nazi issue.
