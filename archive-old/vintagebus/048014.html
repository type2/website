Subject: Deluxe Needed for TV in New York

I received a call from some producer or something that is looking to rent a nice 21 or 23 window in the New York Tri State area for a show on the real bus vs. that concept thing.  Personally, I think they should use a  Kombi or Panel or something that does some work, but I guess since everyone loves deluxes, they want that.  It would be for 1 day between the 23rd and the 28th of April.  I have no idea what it pays.  All of you self promoters out there, this is your big chance to get the ol bus on TV, so call Tom Hayes at 212-486-3010.
