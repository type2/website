&gt;
&gt;So I have an oil bath air cleaner and a 28 PICT - it's been quite cold
&gt;lately - 27 below Celsius today - burrrrr - and things haven't been running
&gt;too smoothly. Carb icing I guess.  So today I'm trying to figure out where
&gt;that hose terminates that comes from the oil bath air cleaner.

On my '64 Standard, with a 1500 from a '68 Bug, there is a little pipe
with a tab welded onto it.  The tab goes over the lower left muffler
stud, and the pipe just &quot;points&quot; at the cylinder fins to pick up a little
warm air.  The pre-heat hose is connected to this pipe.  The other end
goes to the bottom side of the snorkel on the air cleaner.  For testing
purposes, get something like a short piece of 1/2&quot; copper pipe or
electrical conduit that fits well in the end of the hose.  Put the
hose on one end and point the other end at the fins, and maybe use some
wire around the left muffler pipe to hold it in place.  If this seems
to help, you can devise a more permanent mounting.

My Bus also has a clip on the tin, right behind the crankshaft pulley,
for the hose from the air cleaner - it has to cross from the air
cleaner on the right to the hole in the tin on the left.  This is to
keep the hose from getting into the pulley or belt.  If yours
has to cross the engine like this, make sure that the hose can't
get loose.

Good luck!
