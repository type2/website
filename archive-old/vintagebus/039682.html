I was looking around in the paint books at our local body shop, and I 
stumbled across the PPG codes for every single VW color for my '67 bus.  I 
looked up the code L512 (velvet green), and it had the PPG code to type into 
the computer which then spits out the mixture needed.  Is this a unique 
discovery?
Anyway, Kevin, write me if you still need your L380 formula, and I can look 
it up tonight or tomm. afternoon.

I have decided upon L380 Turquoise.  Anyone know how to tell a paint
&gt;  shop what color I am looking for, in terms they will understand?
&gt;
&gt;  Thanks for any insight.
