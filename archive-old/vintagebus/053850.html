&gt; It is a _very_ spilly job.  I have no problem believing

StaLube makes a gear lube pump that screws into their 90 weight bottles,
and works great, relatively fast, and with no spillage (at least, I don't
have any). It costs a couple of bucks, and is available whereever they
sell the lube. You pump a quart at a time, then take a break to either
refill the bottle with lube from a gallon container, or switch out to the
next Stalube quart. They sell their GL4 lube in these bottles too. 
There is a neat clamp-affair at the end of the pump hose, that grabs the
edges of the fill-opening too. 

I've been doing it this way for decades, and it's very neat. I store a
bottle, with the pump attached, in the bus, ready for use.
