Subject: Re: [VB] VW carpet installer.

Don't forget all the home built airplanes!!  I've flown in a couple neat
little airplanes powered by VW engines.  There is a company that cuts
engines in half to make 2 cylinder engines, I've never seen one but have
heard they are nice.

&gt; 
&gt; ps. Everett needs to start another cat in the gallery for VW powered
&gt; equipment. Ricks weed sprayer, snow cats, saw mills, refer truck units, fire
&gt; pumps, generators, tractors, Zambonies and all the other VW powered
&gt; equipment out there.
