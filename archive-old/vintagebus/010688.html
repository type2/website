Hi P&amp;C,
The thing is that you could buy new engine cases with no numbers on them from 
VW dealerships at one time.  Plus the added stupidity of many USA states that 
required vehicals to be registered by the engine number and not the chassi 
number up into at least the early 1980s!  Thus the replacement case was 
stamped with your original engine number.
