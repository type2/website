Hey y'all,
I was wondering if i could get some advice from the all knowledgeable bus 
gurus out there.......ya see i gots me this dope bus i i wanna do a few mods? 
it's really funky,  it's got this huge decklid and no rear hatch, and this 
really funky dash.._dot_cant put  my CD player anywhere! 
1.  where can i find some of those coolie air scoops that go over the vents?  
or should punch louvers all in that big ol decklid?
2.  its got these little funky arms that pop out by the door and light up up 
when i hit the turn signals.....whats the best way to cover them up..bondo?
3.  i almost got rear ended last night.....i was thinkin bout cuttin some 
bigger holes and puttin some trailer lights from pep boys in the back
4. whats the easiest and cheapest way to lower mah ride?
5.  it needs a little rust fixed on it....what do you guys prefer, that spray 
foam stuff or chicken wire?
6. last but not least...anyone have a  good template so i can trim the rear 
wheel wells....it's such a pain to take them big ass tires off!.  i had to 
trash them skinny 16 inch rims and by me some phat chrome empis!

thanks in advance!
how's that ronnie?

Beto
