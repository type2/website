Subject: Head stud pulling out of case...options?
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.A41.3.96.1000305143916.48398B-100000_at_pdx444.pdx.intel_dot_com&gt;


It appears that one of my head studs is pulling out of the case. I went to
do a valve adjustment, and noticed the nut was loose. I got out my torque
wrench and attempted to torque it to 22 ft-lbs, but it wouldn't get
there.... so I took a look and the stud is pulling out of the case. 
What are my options for fixing this? Replace the case? Is it drivable, or
is that  a definite no?

Here is a picture of the stud pulling out:
