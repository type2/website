Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Adjusting the Ring and Pinion

Thanks Matt,

I paid a visit to Rancho and asked them the same questions that I asked 
the list. They stated that the 3.88 r&amp;p do not have the &quot;r&quot; number on 
the pinion gear (same as you mentioned). They told me the &quot;normal&quot; size 
of shims for the gear combination that I am using. I then used Prussian 
Blue to visually check the gears for proper mesh. I have not finished 
the job yet. The pinion shim is right on but I need to put in a thicker 
gear side differential shim.

There is so much to learn when the desire is to do things right.

Thanks for the tip on the online doc project.

Rocky

&gt;&gt; [the Bentley] is exactly the book that I am using to rebuild my 
&gt;&gt; tranny.
&gt;
&gt; OK.  I assumed you were asking &quot;out of the blue&quot; and didn't have a 
&gt; book.
&gt;
&gt; You might want to look at the Without Guesswork books at the doc
&gt; project http://wow.atlasta_dot_net/~mriluvu/oacdp/ .  The '69 version
&gt; has the picture with the r-number as in Bentley, while the '72 version
&gt; mentions that the r-numbers weren't marked on the gears starting in
&gt; January 1972 - look at page 80 and following of the '72 book.  The
&gt; direction is to &quot;determine &quot;actual&quot; measurements before repair&quot; which
&gt; to me implies that you have to measure the gears while they're in
&gt; the original transmission before you take it apart.  I don't know if
&gt; this is the only way to do it, though.
