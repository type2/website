Last time I saw our '75 Rabbit was late in '77 when we unloaded it for 
another lemon car, a '76 H*nda Station wagon.  In '77 I went to the dealer 
to find a part for the '75.  I heard the mechanics in the back laughing.
&quot;Hey, someone's got a '75 and it's still running!&quot;

------------------------
yeah, i think they didn't spend alot of money 'cause they just figuerd
everything was good from the start.  DUH! don't you think it's cheaper to
test products before putting them on the market and having recall problems?
look at all the doodads they put on their 70's-early 80's cars and they
still blew up.  when was the last time you saw a '75 rabbit running around?
