Subject: [VB] '62 getting scrapped
Date: Sun, 28 May 2000 10:22:04 -0400
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Everyone who said &quot;Sure, I'll come get it&quot; has flaked out on my '62, so I'm
scrapping it and to hell with assuming people will follow through. &lt;/rant&gt;

I don't want the parts in it to go to waste, however.  The following parts
are available:

Front bench, rear hatch, driver/pass doors in good shape, cargo doors w/free
rust, front end, small-nut tranny, funky metal/fiberglass heater connections
in back.

Maybe some other stuff, but I've listed the stuff I think that is worth
keeping.  I prefer that you come get it, but I'll be keeping some stuff
nobody claims and I make several shows in the southeast, so I can bring
stuff to shows.  Not the front end or tranny, thanks ;-)  I'm more or less
giving this stuff away as I have absolutely no use for it on my two '67's,
but if you could spare a couple bucks I'd appreciate it...the trend at
boneyards around here is to charge more for pickup than they give you for
the car.  I'm also flat broke and paying for summer classes :-)

Metal parts are available, the nose is spoken for (mine!!)...U-cut...

Bus is located in Newnan, GA, but pickup can be arranged from Dahlonega, GA
or Newnan (front end or tranny Newnan only).  P-mail if interested.

Thanks,

Andrew W.
