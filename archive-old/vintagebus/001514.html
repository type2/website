&lt;&lt;This implies that a Beetle radio of the correct
vintage would not only fit into the late '67 opening,
but would also be correct.
&gt;&gt;

If you look closely at the face of a Beetle radio, you will see the
numbering for the display is painted on a slightly &quot;angled&quot; surface...  This
surface is sorta angled up so the driver/passenger is looking down on the
station numbers.

On a radio which came in a bus, the numbering on the face is painted on a
flat surface, pointing directly forward out the face.   (hope that makes
sense).  If you put a radio from a Beetle into a Bus dash, you won't be able
to see the station numbers on the face.   Thus implying that there were
separate radio types installed in Buses and Bugs..

What to say to somebody who doesn't appreciate your Vintage VW: &quot;In ten
years
my car will still be a classic, your will just be OLD.&quot;

Protect me from the things I want.    Leave now, sleep when you get there.
