This couple is traveling alone from San Diego through Central and South
America in a VW Westfalia.  They plan to ship their Westy from a South
American port to South Africa, then travel up the E. side of Africa with
England as their ultimate destination.

They have a website [  http://www.geocities_dot_com/losligato/  ] and a List for
frequent e-mail updates [the updates are also posted and archived on the
website] and e-postcards.  They also solicit e-mails from those following
their expedition and reply promptly.

Their reports are well written and fascinating, and their descriptions of
their &quot;encounters&quot; with local bureaucracies are enlightening.  Here are the
opening sentences of their latest dispatch:  &quot;We have been pulled over by
the police 14 times in the past week.  No exaggeration, 14 times in seven
days.&quot;  It then goes on to describe the effect the Peruvian earthquakes have
had on their planned itinerary [they are in Peru now], and their experience
of the quakes.

This is definitely one of the better online adventures available, especially
so because of their mode of transportation.

Check it out.....
