Well, I'm no expert, but from all I've heard, it's quite possible to have a
&quot;gas pocket&quot; in the tank (maybe under some coating or something), so
supposedly, the only real safe way to weld on a tank is to fill it with
water or some other non-flammable potion.

Again, I'm just a poor Joe trying to get along with 4 cylinders and one
brake light. Take my words for what they're worth...and keep the change. :)

&gt;Actually you are incorrect!!!!  Gas vapor + flame = boom!  I have welded on 
&gt;a topped off tank before with out any problem.  Or you can remove it and

&gt;its clean and you can no longer smell gas.  There shouldn't be a problem.
