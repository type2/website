&lt;&lt; Have tried and tried this. The fan belt is slipping, have no idea why. Its
a
 new fan belt. I tried adjusting it and it still slips. I'm thinking of just
 paying a mechanic to get it running, my mind is too easily frustrated to
 bother lately. Thanks for the help, though. &gt;&gt;
Hi Brad,
 You did have the tranny in nuetral, and you took out shims between the upper
pulley halfs to tighten the pulley, correct?  You can use the upper pulley by
hand or wrnch on the nut to turn the engine or just use a cresent wrench on
the lower pulley bolt.  If this lower pulley bolt is not tight enough to
allow you to also turn the engine when you need to turn it counter clockwise,
put the VW into fourth gear and apply the E-brake and then tighten the bolt.
Then to do the rest of the work after making sure that the tranny is in
neutral.  Go ahead and give one more try before you go to the mechanic.
After all you are the one who will have to replace the fan belt on trips, not
the mechanic!
