&lt;&lt; The mirros on E bay in my opinion are the same repo's I sell for 18 dollars
 a piece
 I just looked at 10 of the repops and the emblem (VW stamping) al have
 complete circles around them, whoever mentioned the incomplete circle just
 happened to have one with a poor stamping.

The round mirror I got from you Ronnie has an incomplete circle in the VW 
emblem, it is not closed over the V.   I noticed this same thing on other 
repros I have seen, including ones someone claimed were nos.
