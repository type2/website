everybody...
    so if the bearings &amp; seals haven't been available since the 60s, then
it'll be really hard to get it back together I imagine.
    The seals... no biggie, IMHO... the last time I went to the bearing
place in Nashville, I had to wait a good while because the guy in front of
me was being spoon-fed different options on seals. Surely something has been
produced that will work... I have faith in that.
    Baum Tools sells a jig for pinning (actually repinning) main bearing
saddles where the dowel pin holes have worn excessively. The kit comes with
dowel pins that are OS on half of their length... other half goes into the
back side of the bearing as usual. So surely we could pin the bearings..
(judges won't think to look in there). But some new bearings would have to
be made up or turned down from something.
    How odd to have the thrust bearing anywhere but up front in the case...
How would one set crank end play in such a motor? or is that possible? IIRC
a dead DD series 60 we inspected had a main thrust bearing buried somewhere
in the engine. Didn't look like there was any provision for adjusting end
play w/o replacing the bearing...
    Has anyone here rebuilt a bastard engine? please share your experience.
    It's:
    a. interesting
    b. handy for the guy who's getting dworkin's motor-in-pieces.

thanks...

&gt;*a larger front main seal
&gt;*no dowel pins in main bearings (they were split bearings held in place by
&gt; tangs - like cam bearings)
&gt;*the thrust main bearing was not the #1 bearing at the flywheel, but the
&gt; next one back
&gt;*the heads have a seperate chamber under the intake
&gt;*the upper cylinder tin has a hump where the cylinder numbers are stamped
&gt;
&gt;They really have only collector value now, as they are not rebuildable,
&gt;since the bearings &amp; seals have not been available since the '60s.
