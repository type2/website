Subject: Re: [VB] Grrr,  Westfakia!

The 63' I just picked up is very similiar to this 64'.
 It has 6 pop-outs, sub-hatch, and 2-tone paint.  It
is a model 231, and also has the same interior
including the wood headliner.  I haven't seen anything
to convince me that this was a later conversion,
although I guess it is possible.

Matt 

&gt; 
&gt; I thought I read something some where that the
&gt; demand was so great for the
&gt; campmobiles that VW was unable to provide enough
&gt; Kombis and sent standards
&gt; to Westfalia to be converted also. Is this correct?
