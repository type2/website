And you expect to have room for luggage AND people as well?  You'd be lucky
to fit all that stuff in a bus with you passengers, and if driving a pickup,
I guess be prepared to fill the entire cargo area up with parts!  Why not
just carry a cell phone instead of the 50 items on the list?  Maybe a spare
tire, jack, and crowbar.  I'd have trouble finding space in my garage for
all that stuff, let alone carrying it around in a bus!  Why not do a
walk-around each time you drive the vehicle, and set up monthly and/or other
frequencies of maintenance checks.  I know on my 73 bug, I check out
essential items before I drive it each time and make sure I go over the
entire vehicle about every 8 weeks.  Seems to work for me.  I plan to take
the same approach with Fritz once he's alive again.
