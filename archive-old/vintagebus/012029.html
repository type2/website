Hi all this is my first posting so here goes.I'v just picked up a 59 Pannel with semaphores(but the semaphores are missing, although I know who has them)now this is my question. Is there a differance between bus and beetle semaphores? and do bus semaphores have a 2...... part number?

thanks 

steve
59 pannel
