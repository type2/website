I just got off the phone with CB, their feeling is that if your rocker shaft
geometry is correct your exhaust guides should last the life of the valves.
With today's metallurgies the materials used in the guides is far superior
to any that VW originally used, the caution, watch what you buy, there are
guides made in Taiwan that are junk.
Another note! All CB 044 heads now come with 12 mm spark plug holes, more
room for bigger valves!!

Hi Ronnie,

I'm glad you enjoyed the autopsy report on my engine.

I've been looking over your web site to see what the deal is on DP heads. Do
these &quot;outlaw&quot; heads have 9mm valve stems? Are the exhaust valves ss?

Thanks
John
