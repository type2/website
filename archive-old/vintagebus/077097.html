Subject: exaust without heat exchangers?

hey all,
 
    i was wondering if it was possible to drive my bus around without the heater boxes ( heat exchangers?) and still have an exaust system hooked up. so could i? i really dont have the money to buy new ones, and i would only be driving it around till i got a job and could buy new ones. ( im only 16 ). thanks in advance,
                                                
 
p.s.
  my engine is a 1500cc. i plan to put a beetle exaust system on.
