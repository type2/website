&gt; Well, yes.  I was referring to the usual case, not the ideal case.
&gt; The usual being, of course, a forty-plus year-old-valve that's not
&gt; received any maintenance in its entire lifetime.  Even the service
&gt; manual suggested plugging the line with something just in case
&gt; (reports say it looked like a large safety pin, I've never seen one).
&gt;
I wasn't trying to be argumentative, just saying if it doesn't work as it
should, fix it.  In my [limited] reserve valve experience, most actually
leak all the time when old or get plugged up.  If it is not off in the off
position, the reserve cable tube may also be incorrectly adjusted near the
tank.
