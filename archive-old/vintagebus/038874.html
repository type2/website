Well no luck there! Got a reply from Pete Catlett of Euro American RV today.
 
&quot;Thank you for the inquiry.  This plunger type pump has not 
been manufactured for approx 20 years.  Sorry I can be of no 
help&quot;

So if anybody knows of or as a stash of these plunger type pumps that were in
the 65ish on Westfalia's let me know, otherwise I'm buying the overpriced one
from Whale Marine.
