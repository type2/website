&gt;knob on housing, and spinning it opens and closes the choke, then &gt;you
&gt;tighten it at the correct tightness.
&gt;Would the choke really cause this? Seems strange to me.

    Brad, there is a cam affair on the left top of your carb. Other end of
the choke electrical bits. The little toothy staircase bits should be facing
you, there is a bit to make sure they do, but it buggers up sometimes. If
you are seeing a roundish thing with the teeth on the tinware side, its
holding the throttle open a treat. Whip it off and put it up the other way.
Go find a stock one that works and look at it to see.
    Barry Wright
