Subject: North LA County Busavan to BBB! (repost)

Mike Visket, Jim Hayden, and I will be heading to BBB on Friday, Jan 16!

Quite a few people have emailed us about travelling with us as well.

We'll be meeting for breakfast at the Pines Cafe, 4343 Pearblossom Hwy
Palmdale, CA  We'll be meeting at 8:00AM.

&gt;From LA, take the 14 freeway toward Palmdale, take the Pearblossom
Highway
exit, go past about three traffic lights, and look for the restaurant on
the left.  If you get to Four Points, you've gone too far.

Bring your appetite, this place serves great breakfasts!

We'll probably hit the road at about 9:00.  I drive a stock 1600
so expect to cruise around 60 or so.  Bring your FRS radios (on
Ch 2, of course) so we can converse.

George Lyle
