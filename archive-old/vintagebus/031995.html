&gt; I bought a stock replacement muffler for my rebuild 1600DP (used to have 
&gt; an extractor exaust) about half a  year ago. It is made by Kradon,  Brazil P/N 211 251 051EB.
&gt; Now that I finally get around to finishing this motor I find that the ends that 
&gt; are supposed to slide on to the heaterboxes are *barely* long enough to  meet the 
&gt; pipe coming out of the heaterboxes, barely. They are about 1 inch long and it seems that
&gt; they are should to be longer then that


..some mufflers have shorter pipes where they go on to the heater boxes.   Sounds like you have one of these, and you unfortunately need to get one with the longer pipes.  Not sure why this happens
