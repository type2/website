Rusty VanBondo,

Did I hear Kyle say you put in a Rancho 3.88?  With the HD sidecover(s)?

How did that go? And can you give some input on how it went together
and what I should look for?

Mine is going together before the 15 of December and the guy who's
doing it (that would be me) hasn't pulled one apart in 5 years ( that would
be when I tore it down) and he (again me) hasn't ever put one back 
together.

To the rest of the list:

Is there a set of instructions, step by step, on the web anywhere, that I 
could reference?

Thanks.

Cecil
