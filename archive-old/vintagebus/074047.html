VERY Nice Thom!

What was their rationale behind no larger than 25x25?  It looks like its in 
the back of your property and not obtrusive, what if you wanted to make it 
a three car wide?

My brother-in-law built himself a similar unit, but the city let him go 30w 
x 50 deep.

Are you going to install that lift we saw a month ago in your 
driveway?  That recessed mounting is a nice touch.

Congrats on the new addition
