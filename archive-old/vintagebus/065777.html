&gt;Hi All,
&gt;
&gt;Its fixed... well almost... we ended up welding the out riggers to the
&gt;trailer, putting jack stands under the frame near the front bumper brackets,
&gt;and pulling it back together.  It worked flawlessly.  I still need to get a
&gt;frame section to repair the rotten spot and I think I've already located it.
&gt;The story is posted up on the web page:

Wow David,

The happy ending is Great!  I'm waiting with baited breath to hear your 
wife's reaction to her present and this entire saga.  The kids must be 
going nuts keeping it quite.

Can't wait to hear the final chapter.
