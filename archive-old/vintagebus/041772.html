&gt; This probably isn't very good advice. It's true that the aluminum expands
&gt; faster than the steel. The problem is that expansion makes the spark plug

This is a problem I give my physics students!

If you have a piece of metal with a hole drilled in it, and heat the
metal, does the hole get smaller or larger?

It's a bit of a puzzler, and the class is usually split 50-50 on it.

To figure out what really happens, split the hole into four quarters and
consider one of the quarters.  When the metal is heated, every dimension
of the quarter will grow, including the arc that was part of the hole.  If
the arc is longer, the circumference of the hole will be larger, therefore
the hole grows.
