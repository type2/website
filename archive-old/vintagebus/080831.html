Subject: Re: [VB] Transmission oil seal question

&gt;Did you grease the shaft &amp; inside &amp; outside of the seal before installing

I greased the inside (around the shaft) but not the outside (trans
case).

&gt;Did you use a pipe over the input shaft as a drift?

Yes.

Now for my next question, to Clara and everyone... How much oil is too
much on the clutch friction material?

I had oil all over the bell housing so I mopped that out and then
decided I should check the clutch.  I took the pressure plate off
and I can just barely tell that there's been oil on the steel
surfaces -- when I drag my finger across them there's a hint of
oil.  Same for the contact area on the flywheel.  The clutch linings
weren't dripping with oil but I guess they have to have some if the
contact surfaces are oil.

The clutch seemed to be working OK before this.  What I am mainly
wondering is: can I hose down everything with solvent and motor on,
or is one drop of oil on the clutch plate too much?
