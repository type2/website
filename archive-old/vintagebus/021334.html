I shipped a set of Deluxe trim from FL to CAL. to a fellow LIST MEMBER! Sent
it  UPS without BENDING  for $57 and change insured at $800 i used a
Cardboard carpet roll (get it from any carpet store and they come up to 20
feet long!) that was bent at the end kinda like a candy cane.  Worked great.
It would of been about $15 cheaper but i shipped C.O.D. and insured it.
