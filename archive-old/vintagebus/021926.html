To all.
The Wolfgang kit looks like a good idea and a good $ deal. Much less work 
than either the beam change out or the remachined tortion arms. It appears to 
be an adapter to go between the mounting points on the spindle for the 
backing plate for the drum brakes and the caliper. It preserves ride height 
and the quality of king pin ride. Still uses calipers and rotors from 72-79 
buses and the narrow 5 wheels. Some folks prefer the softer ride and cheaper 
rebuild costs available with ball joints. Some prefer the somewhat crisper 
and bumpier ride of the king pins. Personal preferance. You still need the 
pressure reducer for the rear end. If you don't use a &quot;disc brake&quot; master 
cylinder, don't forget the 2 lb check valve.
