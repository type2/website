I know this may not tickle anyones fancy but I saw it and I just had to
mention it.

A stock 1600 engine was put on the stand at the Mason County Fairgrounds
meet today. Bets were taken. The only mod was a dual carb set up. Running
flat out, at 6000 rpm, this motor, pulled from a running car, ran for 21
minutes! If it hadn't sprung oil leaks I swear it would have ran longer!
I am not a big fan of this crazy idea of ruining perfectly good engines, but
it made me pause and think....previously today a rebuilt 1600 ran for 4 and
a half minutes. The builder thought that was good. But here was a stock,
german engine, without balancing as far as we knew that lasted so long at a
high rpm. Amazing.
I wish I had grabbed that engine out of a junk yard!

Ok bus content:
Nothing much to get at this show. Lots of things of course. My red 63 didn't
take me there and I was kind of bummed. No the 63 is OK, nothing wrong with
it, just with a child I decided to take the Toyojapwhater, you figure it
out. But that stupid toyo is going to cost me far more then my bus ever has.
It needs CVS and muffler and other work, and my bus has kept its service
price down to a minimum. Oil change and thats about it, except for a
replacement door handle for the front drivers side. That cost $20. Try
replacing anything on the Toyo for $20. And CV's on the bus? Nope dont need
them.
I will be replacing the tranny oil this week with gl4, and hope that makes
it happy. Oh no $10! That will make my cost of running this bus $34 for this
year (less gas). Love my bus, put many, many miles on it weekly.
