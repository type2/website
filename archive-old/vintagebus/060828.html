Subject: Carb Part  - Please Help!

--0-1158605297-1023211082=:39306


Hello,

I am looking for a Idling cutoff valve for my 1973 VW Transporter. 

The engine is a 1776 and it has dual single barrel solex carburetors.

The old idling cutoff valve got damaged in storage during a move.

Does anybody have one of these parts lying around on a bad carb and are willing to part with it?

Or does anybody know where I can get one of these either new or used?

Thanks in advance,

Chris
