Subject: re: battery explosion and clutch cable breaks

Thanks for the info.  The clutch cable broke somewhere
in the middle inside the tube or sleeve.  When I
noticed the play at the pedal I checked both ends at
the swagged fittings.  That's where they broke before.
 I'm going to replace the sleeve as well in case it is
worn and fraying the cable there.  I'll see when I get
it out.  As for the battery, it was one of the sealed,
no maintenance types.  I recharged it the previous
week.  As Eric &amp; Barb pointed out, I'll guess that it
needed water and the plates were exposed.  Here's my
dumb question.  Do you have to service a sealed, no
maintenance battery?  What is the best battery to use?
 I have no extra electrical equipment to power and I
am using an alternator.  I read the article in the
library so I'll check the alternator and match the
battery to it.  It has the internal regulator.  How do
you test this alternator?  Thanks again and Happy New
Year.
