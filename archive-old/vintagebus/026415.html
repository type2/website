&gt; heh, hey guys check this one out.... I can guarantee you'd be the ONLY one
&gt; on your block with this...
&gt; Wonder what that 3rd door accomplishes? Also noticed its not QUITE the same
&gt; as the brochure cover....did coachbuilts vary THAT much from original
&gt; concept?

This looks like a Kemperink, or Beastelwagen.
Ken Mattsen, in Seattle with the Bus Stop has two, one split camper made
from the shell of one, andanother he takes to the PNW swaps.
Cool rigs! Very very rare. Maybe 4 in US. Laurence Meredith's books,
Custom VW Bus and Original VW Bus have articals about these Danish
coachbuilt buses....

I have a pic of Ken's split beastelwagen on my web page.
