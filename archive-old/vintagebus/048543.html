Subject: Kansas City area bus people

KC Kombies is putting together a mailing list, so if you would like to be
included, send me your email and I will put you on the list.

KC Kombis Taco night:
from Dan Kinsesy (ThatVWGUY)

Short notice but Erin Lassely from the Vintage bus list is coming down from
Nebraska this Saturday (probably, depends on the amount of snow)  I thought
this would be a great excuse to get the KC Kombis together.

Erin will be staying at my place so lets have an informal get together on
Saturday night.  We will serve Tacos.  Bring your favorite beverage,
snacks, stories, or
whatever.  Anytime after 5pm would be great.  Kids and spouses welcome.

For directions, or more info, contact Dan at:
email &lt;ThatVWGuy_at_aol_dot_com&gt;
phone (816) 254-3255
