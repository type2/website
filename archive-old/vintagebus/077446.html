Subject: Re: [VB] That bus at Barrett-Jackson - Interior panels

yes very pretty bus ... I wish there were more pictures of the interior.  

The front door panels didn't have pockets through.  :(

  FWIW  Buses through March 61 had pockets in the cab door panels.   Until 
they changed to the como green or basalt interior.   And they are very handy.

in that bus.
