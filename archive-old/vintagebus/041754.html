&gt; 1300, 1500, 1600)?

Well, the correct rev limit might vary by driver and application.  IMO the
correct rev limit is a few hundred RPM over the highest RPM that you will
experience in normal operation.

You don't want to run up against the rev limit in normal operation.  It's
a safety device to prevent engine damage if it runs away or if, stricken
by temporary insanity, you lend your bus to someone nicknamed &quot;leadfoot&quot;

Also keep in mind that a rev limiter won't prevent overrevving on
downshifting  This probably lunches more engines than heavy throttle feet.
