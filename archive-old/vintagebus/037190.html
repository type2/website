 i installed this mini tach i had in my old bus in my driver this weekend. i 
 was curious cuz this bus has a small nut in it. what is redline in a SN 
 tranny?
-------------
depends on what the r&amp;p is, and whether or not you have a bus 4th.   

of course, people all have differnet ideas on what rpms is max,    I 
personally hold with 3K for max cruising speed, will drive at faster rpms 
uphills/for changing gears for a short period.  3K  is where it seems to me 
the VW motors run the sweetest on long hauls.
.........

 as i was watching speed and RPM through the gears, some questions 
 came up. according to the red shift points on the speedo it would seem red 
 line would be about 4200. BUT, in fourth cruising on the freeway this 
 morning, around 60mph, my rpm's were about 4500. am i RIGHT THERE?
---------------------------
if that is what the tach says, it is proably right.  what year is the 
bus/speedo?  is it 66?   if so, the speedo has shift marks on it for a tranny 
with big nuts, 1.26 redux instead of the 1.39 you have with the little nuts.

ready to 
 blow the trans?

it is really more of an issue with the wear you put on the motor.    cruising 
at 4500rpms can be fun I guess, but it does put more wear on the motor.  this 
whole issue has been gone over ad nauseum.  
 what are you speeds at 2K, 2500, 3K in 4th is what I want to know.

now, on this newly paved area of freeway near my house, my 
 bus FLIES! sometimes i will look down and be pushin' 70!! WOW, slow down. i 
 run 185/75's on 14's. when traveling i usually maintain about 62mph. if it 
 creeps up, i slow down. my tranny is smooth and quiet, i dont want to F 
 anything up ;)
 thanks for the help, hope this makes sense,
