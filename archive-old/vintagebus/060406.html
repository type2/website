Subject: Re: [VB] '67 Model Year Questions

[...]


 The 3rd digit: 7 means it is a 67. Build date of Oct 66 means it is a 67.
Yours is an early one without dual mc and backups. Looking at all the 247
deluxes listed on Thoms registry, I only see one other 'early' one with code
430. 247078285 and it was built 2 months after yours: Dec 66.
What are the M codes on the plate behind the pass seat?


&gt; My 67 deluxe has VIN of 247053979. Manufactured in Oct 1966.
 &gt; I am sure its a single circuit MC and it has no separate backup lights.
 &gt; Could this be a 66 model year? Not what the title says...

 &gt; &gt;My ex very early 67 had back ups and dual brakes only because it has M
code
 &gt; &gt;430. Early 67's did not come with them as standard equipment. That
happened in
 &gt; &gt;the middle of the 67 model year. A lot of early ones did not have either.
 &gt; &gt;My 67 Standard does have 'em because it was made Feb 22, 67.
 &gt; &gt;And it does not have code 430.

 &gt; &gt;&gt;  &gt; 1967 deluxe bus - did this come with single circuit m/c and brakes or
dual?
 &gt; &gt;&gt;  &gt; Also, did this year bus have backup lights?
