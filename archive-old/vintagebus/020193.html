  I had 10k + mi. on my motor when we left on a trip 
that racked up more than 9,000 mi over a 3 month time 
span and it was built by a newbie (me). We had several 
10 hour days and 1 14 hour day of constant driving, 
other than stopping briefly for gas. 
  It was my experience that when you drive your bus that 
much each day you will become very aware of how it runs 
and when something &quot;just isn't right&quot;. Yes, guages do 
help with this &quot;symbiosis&quot;, so does a lack of a radio. 
  Do a pre-trip checkup, and maintain it (I adjusted the 
valves while staying at &quot;Graceland RV Park&quot;, and Svea 
Minnesota- home of the worlds largest ball of twine). 
Drive it smartly, check the oil/give it a once over at 
each gas stop, and listen to it for early complaints 
that can be fixed before they cause serious problems. 
This should minimize any chances of a catastrophic 
failure.
  ...and if you do break down hard, pick someplace 
better than Fargo, North Dakota.
