Subject: Type 3 Rear Drums on a Bus?
Date: Sun, 27 Feb 2000 23:50:46 PST
Mime-Version: 1.0

Lists:

A while back I asked the question about the availability of rear drums for 
1963 and earlier Buses.

Someone emailed me and said that Type 3 rear drums would work if a spacer is 
used.  Has anyone else tried this? Where does the spacer go? How big is the 
spacer? What is the fastest land animal? (sorry)
