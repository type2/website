&gt; Has anyone repro'd a westy tent? 

It's been done over here. Someone I know has a totally original '63 
westfalia, which is crammed full of factory fitted options (and has all 
the original paperwork to match) It came over here from Italy about 
four years ago - still with the plastic protective covers fitted at the 
Westfalia factory on the floor and cushions!! One previous owner, low 
mileage as well of course - used for a summer holiday once a year by 
the PO.....  It is beautiful!

The only thing it didn't come with was a tent. The current owner had 
one (poles and canvas) made up using an orignal tent as a pattern. 
Definitely not a cheap option though - cost about 600 pounds (nearly 
1000US$) Westfalia tents are incredibly rare over here - I know because 
I'm still looking for one! And I could live with a post '59 one....  ;)

I can e-mail a pic if anyone is interested - unfortunately the only pic 
I have of the '63 with the tent just has the top canopy up, and not the 
sides.
