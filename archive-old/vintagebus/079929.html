Subject: [VB]: dynamat

	A friend of mine wants to give me some dynamat; and I have been thinking about putting is in my bus ( in fact I have thought about it before ).  I have read a couple web articles on it but I my main concern is with removal.
	First off; my bus is a standard that has been partially fitted with a bay wesyty interior.  It is missing the headliner from the cab back and has a Z bed in back.
	 I want to put the dynamat on my roof and over the engine compartment area.  I beleive that it will work but I am worried about it ruining the originality of the bus.  Granted, as a standard converted to a camper with a Bay! interior its not going to win any stock classes bu the paint on the engine compartment is original and the roof is in nice shape.
	 My friend suggested that maybe a heat gun would also remove it.  
	 
	 Oh; I also have been considering putting in the doors ( will it trap moisture? )

	 Thanks.
	 rob
