Subject: asbestos pods revisited

I never saw the end thread concerning the &quot;cancer pod&quot; that someone
mentioned on an earlier post.  I looked under my bus and saw the same
pod between the heat exchangers and the metal tubes.  I did see that
Eric&amp;Barb stated that VW never put asbestos inside of VWs.  I was just
curious and wondered if anyone ever ventured into the &quot;pod&quot;.
