&lt;&lt;  EBAY
 will  not help you  evan on missleading or misslisted item's.   john &gt;&gt;


Sure they will, eBay insures every Auction up to $200 of the purchase price.  

I had some jerk off in AZ (George W. Parker from Tucson if any of you know 
him) send me a pair of sandblasted and TOTALLY worthelss carbs and then 
refuse a refund because I didnt email him for the &quot;real story&quot; behind the 
carbs.  He totally lied about the condition of them and because of that I 
went through the eBay arbitration process to try and obtain an insurance 
claim refund.

The guy continued to be  a moron during the arbitration process so I did file 
an insurance claim with eBay's insurance company and almost 5 months later I 
got a $175 check back from them.  They take out $25 for a processing charge 
which is lame, but it's better being out $100 than it is to be out 
$275....and I still have decent linkage too and 2 totally disassembled, sand 
blasted Weber 40 IDF's

At the end of the arbitration process, eBay told me they were sorry that 
nothing was resolved and gave me several other options for getting my $ back. 
 They provided me with the address of the Attorney General's office in AZ and 
also explained that you can file mail fraud charges against them if the items 
were sent via the USPS......my idiot used UPS

If you want to read up about why eBay is (can be) safe and what your options 
are when you think you've been ripped off, check here
