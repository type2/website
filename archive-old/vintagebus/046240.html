Subject: Red lite (cont'd)
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Well, er--the dimmer switch DOES work....now that I branched the 59 spade to 
the (new) #30 on the relay, the way BFY told me.  But I still get red lite on 
with the engine running UNLESS I turn on the headlites.    Then everything 
works fine.  I don't mind running with daytime lites, I guess, but I would 
like to know what I've got hooked up wrong.  All the terminals seem to match, 
but there's got to be an error in there somewhere.  --John Tomerlin
