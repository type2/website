Subject: Re: [VB] friday fun- &quot;Top 10 Things I have learned shopping for
  VW's &amp;  Parts online&quot;

i drove from eugene to olympia to look at a dormobile that fits both of
these perfectly.  it was described on the phone as having one small spot of
filler, which actually meant that only one patch of bondo was falling out,
and the rest was still firmly in place. even had a mismatched 1/4 panel,
inward vents on one side, outties on the other. i bought it anyway :-)


&gt; 4) To many people, body filler can be described as
&gt; &quot;Solid&quot;.

&gt; 1) If a vehicle is described as needing &quot;TLC&quot;, then
&gt; what it really needs is definitely NOT Tender, Loving,
&gt; or Caring..it IS BFH and LDW (Big F-ing Hammering and
&gt; Lotta Damn Welding)
