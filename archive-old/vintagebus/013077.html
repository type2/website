While we are talking Plate frames, it brought to mind the Owners Manual
pouches with the Dealership names embossed on them, I have some plate
frames and pouches I will dig up and list a few that I can sell or trade or
whatever.

See you at Bug-O-Rama, I will be there selling VW SERVICE coveralls, vw
literature, owners manuals and mucho mas.

Come by, say HI
