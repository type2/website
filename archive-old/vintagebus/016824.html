Subject: dormo roff vents via susan dolvin/new motor, blah, blah.
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

i acquired my roof vents via us postal today from
susan dolvin. they are very nice and look great. i
would highly recommend her to anyone. not because
she's the only game in town, but because they are the
best thing since sliced bread if you own a dormobile.
and, if you don't own a dormobile, you could also use
them as bulletproof vests in a paintball match. sorry.
long day.

my bus is almost through surgery. all that needs to be
done is have  &quot;double bypass cab floor surgery&quot; and it
will be ready to come home. then it's reassembly time!
i took a crapload of pictures but i am waiting on a
terminator for my scsi scanner before i can scan them.
after i get that, they will be on my webpage. if
anyone has a terminator, i will trade you some NOS
wolfsburg dirt for it. yes, i am that desperate.

it looks like ezekiel, the one armed mechanic is
coming over tommorow to go over the new motor and make
sure everything is tip-top. then i can just plop her
in. i have pics of the motor, aswell.

peace, love, and shellac.
