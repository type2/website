Subject: After the 46mm axle nut, brake disaster.  Glad I got in!

Wholly Crap!  I'm glad I got that axle nut off... One of the star screws was
out ALL THE WAY, I mean ready to fall out.   The other was all the way in...
The drum is destroyed from the one shoe being worn down to metal and the
other one looks brand new :)  At least I can get away with replacing only
one shoe :)

My Bus Depot order arrived at 10:30am from UPS... so I'm getting those
brakes in order.  Tom can vouch that the PO of this bus had some serious
problems with brake maintenance.. the front right was a mess too, and the
other rear cylinder was leaking :)

No wonder it pulled to the right... the front left cylinders were leaking
and soaking the shoe, the rear left were totally screwed-up.  So only my
right side brakes were working.  Glad I replaced that right rear cylinder at
Thom's before driving home (800 miles) :)

The left front was waiting on the parts that arrived today.  Whoo hoo!

He did.  With 3/4&quot; impact tools he got it off on about the 25th impact.
Took a good 5 seconds of pounding before it went.
