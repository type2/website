 Going to pick up the 61/62 limo combo Sat. Will more than likely be parting
it out as it is mostly stripped now, unless Kyle jumps in and wants another
one. Will post list of parts next week. Who wants to convert their kombi
into a 23 window?. How about a removable hardtop with sunroof for a single
cab over the bed area?

 See ya all Fri. night at Jerome. Congrates to Dawn &amp; Rich.
