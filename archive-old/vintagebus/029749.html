I am now the proud owner of a 1960 Double Cab!

http://thesamba_dot_com/vw/scrapbook/60dc/

Here are the stats:
65K original miles
99% rust free
Sealing Wax red (originally) - interior is still all original, exterior
is in red primer.

M-code plate:
08 02 0
392 181 207 544
UP 265 SK 654E 568785

Plate translation:
Feb. 8th, 1960
392    = USA combo (I assume, actually unknown, anyone else have this?)
181    = Chrome hubcaps
207    = Tilt assembly for bed
544    = Unknown, M-code for &quot;Everett's Double Cab&quot;? ;)
UP     = USA - Portland
265    = Double Cab, LHD
SK 654E= Special Kolour 654E = Sealing Wax Red (SWR)
568785 = VIN #

Something I learned:
Until I bought this Double Cab, I did not know that Double Cabs had a heater
outlet for the rear seat.  The 2 heater box tubes come up to the front like
a Single Cab or Kombi but then a little pipe comes off the big tube and
pumps heat out in front of the rear seat at the bottom of the front seat
divider.

Parts wanted list on its way...

Comments welcome,
