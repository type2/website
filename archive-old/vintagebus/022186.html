&gt;I need to replace the current hoses in my '60 crewcab (stock front and

&gt;Do the stainless hoses suffer from this problem with age?
&gt;For a street application (bus) would I be just as well off replacing
&gt;with new rubber hoses?

For stock applications, stick to the rubber lines.   There are perceived
performance gains with the braided steel lines, but they are designed for
cars with higher overall levels of maintenance.  I remember this discussion
from the Porsche list eons ago.
