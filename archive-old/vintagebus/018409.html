If you look at how a pancake engine heater works you will find why what you
propose will not work with the results you think it will.


A pancake blower only assists the heater system when the engine is at an
idle.The system has flaps that close when fan speed drops cutting off
airflow from backfeeding the cooling fan allowing the assist fan to feed the
heat system.When engine speed increases the pressure of the air generated
from the engine mounted fan overcomes these flaps forcing air into the
heater boxes.I rember these flaps on yhe lower portion of the cast fan
shroud.

Please forgive the stupid question.  I'm thinking of putting a pancake
bus engine heater blower on an upright engine -- giving me heater
blowers independent of engine speed.

Yes, I will block off the fan shroud openings.  Will mount blower in
pretty much stock location and may eventually feed the intake from the
passenger compartment for some recirc effects (this is a bus; I can put
a hole in the side of the unused spare tire well w/o munging up the
car's looks too much).

But in the back of my mind I have this nagging memory of hearing
somewhere that the heat exchangers might be damaged by this arrangement
over time: the stock setup results in a certain amount of air movement
through the HEs and the blower-only arrangement will eliminate this. 
But surely that would have been a problem for the '72-up busses, in
which this arrangement is stock.

Anyone else hear of anything like this?

Another consideration for an inevitably leaky car: if I go with the
recirculation hose, this reduces the overall cabin pressure, which may
make me draftier.
