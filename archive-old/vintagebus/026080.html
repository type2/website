hey all..
I've got 2 small tennis-ball tail lights for sale.  Complete with
housing and chrome ring.  no bulbs.  I also have an extra lens that will
go with it..although it is cracked badly..but still intact.  Make me an
offer.

I also found a speedometer today in a box of bus stuff that I got.  On
the back it has 2 screws and a mounting plate that sticks out around it
with 3 holes placed equally away from each other.  on the bottom it has
a threaded port for the cable.  The face is plastic..in decent shape.
The needle is red towards the middle..and white on the pointer end..the
outer end.
The face says on the top inside the speedo &quot;Finsen&quot; in real fancy
lettering...under the needle it says &quot;DeLuxe '53' &quot; in fancy lettering
also...
the face has a chrome ring around it...
What is this for? Is it bus stuff?  Its in pretty good shape..the chrome
is all fine..
what is it and what is it worth and does anyone need it? hehe

thanks!
Isaiah
