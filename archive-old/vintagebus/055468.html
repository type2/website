I was wondering today - As your motor oil gets old, toward that 2,500 to
3,000 mile &quot;I better change it&quot; mark, will your oil pressure drop?

So... A question for those with an oil pressure gauge - All things equal,=

is your oil pressure higher right after you change your oil?

Interested,
