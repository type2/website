You have to be alot more carefull with the ribbed bumpers on how you &quot;grind&quot; 
on them.
But, since the metal is alot thinner, it mkes it pretty easy to hammer/dolly 
them.
If youre good with a hammer/dolly, you can usually fill the rest with a think 
coat of primer.
Thats how I did mine.
They look pretty close to new.
