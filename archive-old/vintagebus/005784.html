i got the details on the auction that everette mentioned. the women
confirmed that a '63 and '64 bug, and '78 bus as well as vw parts will be
auctioned off but stressed that &quot;none of them are in very good condition&quot;.
so i guess take that advice for whatever it's worth. anyway, here's the
details

contact phone # 812/473-6688
estate auction in evansville, indiana
starts at 10am
off of highway 41
east on riverside
