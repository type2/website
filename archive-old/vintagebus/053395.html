And we pause for a commercial break from our

&gt; Listfolk,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm going to try something new tomorrow. It may be
&gt; the only time I do it; I
&gt; really don't know yet.
&gt; 
&gt; During the off-season (December thru March), we
&gt; actually have a slow day
&gt; here and there. I'm not being sarcastic; it really
&gt; is an extreme rarity.
&gt; During most of the year, we can barely keep up with
&gt; daily demand (a
&gt; &quot;problem&quot; for which I owe all of you a great bit of
&gt; thanks). But on a rare
&gt; day here and there, everything just lines up to make
&gt; a slow day.  Sales
&gt; volume is seasonally low, no big shipments are due
&gt; to arrive that day, the
&gt; computer didn't crash, no one called in sick, and it
&gt; looks like most of our
&gt; existing orders will make it out the door early in
&gt; the day.  I never know
&gt; when a day like that will happen until the night
&gt; before, at best.
&gt; 
&gt; Since we have &quot;excess capacity&quot; on those days, so to
&gt; speak, it makes good
&gt; business sense to fill that capacity, even if it
&gt; means reducing prices.  So
&gt; that's exactly what I'm going to do.
&gt; 
&gt; Tomorrow (Thursday) will be the first, and maybe
&gt; last, Listmember
&gt; Appreciation Day.  Tomorrow, all listmembers get
&gt; TRIPLE listmember
&gt; discounts. That means 15% off of our discounted
&gt; price, on all items that
&gt; normally qualify for listmember discounts (which is
&gt; most items, with a
&gt; minimum $50 qualifying purchase; details and
&gt; exclusions are recapped below).
&gt; Also, I will allow a 5% listmember discount on Sale
&gt; items (items on the
&gt; website Bargains Page or in the Late Breaking News
&gt; insert sent with our
&gt; catalogs), which normally do not get any listmember
&gt; discount at all.
&gt; 
&gt; This discount will run us dangerously close to
&gt; selling below cost, depending
&gt; on what people order. That's why I'm not sure if
&gt; I'll be able to repeat the
&gt; offer.  I'll have to look closely and make sure that
&gt; I didn't actually LOSE
&gt; money at those prices.  Also, to that end, there
&gt; will be a few rules and
&gt; exclusions, which are listed under this email. 
&gt; Sorry to have to put a few
&gt; conditions on the offer, but please understand that
&gt; at 15% off I'm
&gt; dangerously close to losing money, so I have to be a
&gt; little bit cautious if
&gt; we are to make this work.
&gt; 
&gt; You can order via the website, order desk (by part
&gt; number only), or customer
&gt; service. To get the price, you MUST ask for the
&gt; Triple Discount when
&gt; ordering by phone.  If you order via the phone, the
&gt; discount will be
&gt; calculated right then and there and we can give you
&gt; your new total.  If
&gt; ordering via the website, put TRIPLE DISCOUNT in the
&gt; &quot;comments&quot; section of
&gt; the order form and we will manually adjust the price
&gt; prior to shipping (even
&gt; though the discount will not show up on the
&gt; website). Sale ends tomorrow
&gt; night (at 7 pm via phone and 11 pm via internet,
&gt; eastern time). But it may
&gt; be better to order early as some popular items may
&gt; sell out.
&gt; 
&gt; This would be a good time to stock up on &quot;staples&quot;
&gt; such as filters, tune up
&gt; parts, belts, etc. Think about what you might need
&gt; in the spring and grab it
&gt; now while the price is low. And take a look at the
&gt; website Bargains Page, as
&gt; this will be your only chance to &quot;double dip&quot; and
&gt; get an additional 5% off
&gt; of those Sale prices (since they are normally
&gt; excluded from all further
&gt; discounts).
&gt; 
&gt; If this doesn't kill me too badly, I'll try to
&gt; spring another one on you
&gt; here and there when a slow day comes up. There may
&gt; be one a month, or a few
&gt; a month, or none at all, depending on how things go.
&gt;  We'll see...
