Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [T2] .009, There MUST be some advantages

ya- the only thing is you may have to file a notch into the 009 style cap to 
fit the 019
 - no big deal- just compare it to your old cap.

 &gt; It is better than a 009 from what I can feel when I drive it. The problem 
 &gt; with the 019 and 010 is that the tune up parts for them are very 
expensive. 
 &gt; $25+ for just the cap!
 &gt; They can't be all that bad if that's what the &quot;real&quot; racers use in their 
 &gt; cars. (010) 
 
 Hi Sean,
 Strange!  The cap used on the 010 &amp; 019 is the same used on the old German 
 and modern Brazilian built 009s and can be had for less than $10.00.
