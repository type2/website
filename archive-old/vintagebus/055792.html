Subject: Re: [VB] Cam install question

As far as I know, there are two different pitches on cam gears. The
'regular', and the ol '36hp'.  Some people use the 36horse gears because
they have less angle to them, and reduce the side thrust.

Don't know if this is what is causing it, but something to check......

Subject: [VB] Cam install question


I am rebuilding an engine for my 66 bus.  It came with a type 3 engine and I
had the case cleaned and checked  by a machinist and bought a reground crank
and cam and
bearings.  Everything was going back together well until I tried setting the
cam in.  For some reason it will not go down into the bearings.  I have a
1/4 inch gap on the bearing closest to the cam gear and it sets in the one
at the flyweel end.  I have reseated the crank a few times and I am sure
that it is setting correctly.  It looks like they do not mesh together.
My question is this.  Is it possible that the timing gear has a different
pitch than the cam gear and it would prevent it from seating properly?  I
looked on the cam and there is a number one.   I have heard somewhere that
there are different sizes.  Is there some trick to making this set properly
or should I buy another cam?
