&gt; &gt;From what I understand copper will sweat and increase waterin the line,

Sweat?  Nope.  Since the copper conducts heat so well, the air will be
cooled faster in the tubing.  If the air is humid (in Havasu?!) the water
will saturate out of the air resulting in liquid water in the tube.  the
same would happen with iron pipe.

The air stays hotter in PVC, so the water remains as vapor until it
encounters a big pressure drop such as a paint gun nozzle.

The best setup is one that condenses the most water out of the air before
it gets to the gun.  You _do_ have to trap the liquid water at the gun end
of the line, though.

An old painter I know made a great water separater from 3 inch galvanized
pipe.  he made a custom cap with an inlet that extended halfway down the 3
foot length of the big pipe.  The outlet was flush with the top of the
same cap, and his flex-hose connected directly to the outlet.  The line
from the compressor to the separator was 1/2 galvinized, but could have
been copper as well. The lower cap had a small valve to drain
water. On a humid day he would collect a pint of water with heavy use.

It might be less expensive to build something like this in copper rather
than galvinized.  Big iron pipe is pretty expensive.
