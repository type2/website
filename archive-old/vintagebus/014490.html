Tonight I had a guy from a professional restoration shop come out and go over
my 64 with me so that I could show him all the things I wanted him to fix....

One thing he said kind of scared me
though.  He said &quot;you have got to be the pickiest person I have ever dealt
with, I respect that, but man... this is going to cost a lot.&quot;  I think it is
insane that a person running a professional restoration business (wilson's
auto restoration. owings, MD) would consider ME to be picky.  I would think
pickieness would be something that they deal with day in and day out.  My bus
project is in depth, that I will give you.  But I don't really see it as the
ultimate show quality job although I won't deny that I wish it was.  Its just
that I have a lot of work, money, time, NOS parts, etc. going into this van...
           ...any words of advice from the wise?

bodywork takes time, and the better you want it the more it'll cost.   Sounds
like you know a fair bit about bodywork, take a close look at the bodies and
paint jobs at the next show for  attention to detail or the lack thereof.
When I planned to get some paint and rust repair done on my 65, my goal was
just make it look tidier and keep the water out- no big deal.  I learned about
bodywork doing it and now some people say I should show it,  though I can look
at it and point out a billion of things wrong with the paint and body,
although it does look a ton better than it did before (and new window seals).
It would have been better looking if it had more time spent on it, but there
was a limit.      Who knows- ask the shop what the usual customer does- maybe
they just drop it off and say paint it such and such a colour.     A lot of
people don't look beyond a coat of shiny paint.
