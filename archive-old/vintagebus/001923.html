&gt;Josh died last night. I was told he took his own life. I don't know much
&gt;more than that, probably never will. Chad was very upset and I didn't press
&gt;for details.


I sure hated to read this - I thought it was a joke at first but then I
realized that Ken wouldn't joke about something like this.  Josh has a great
web page and he always had good stories to tell about his &quot;little Sahara&quot;
excursions.  He was one of the few brave souls who would tow their sand rail
behind their bone stock 71 Westy.  I often wrote to him and planned that
someday, we'd meet at Little Sahara together.  I guess now it'll have to
wait for that big sand pile in the sky.  It wasn't too long ago that he
rescued a ton of buses from a junkyard someplace.  We'll all miss ya Josh.
