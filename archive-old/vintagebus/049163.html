~~~now why in the heck are you concerned with color schemes, fabric, tent poles, cabinets, etc????  can't you just slap anything in there and drive it?  what's all this concern about correctness anyway?  you should be ashamed!!!  ~~~

On a serious note Greg, I do have the correct mustard color paint for the cargo area.  I might even have the recipe, but if not I can give you a sample to have a paint shop work from.  We had to blend a batch for my '59 Westy and I have extra.  It came out really nicely, as exact as one could get.

I also have the &quot;no paint* tent poles.  Not sure if the tent setup is the same for a '56 and '59, but I was told the poles I have were a one year only item, one year only that is in terms of them not being painted.  Not sure what year that one year only was intended for.

And no Les, you don't get to look at either!

Robert
