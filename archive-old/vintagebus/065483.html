Subject: RE: Dual circuit master cylinders

Was written by Paul,

&gt;I didn't explain why a bigger diameter master cylinder causes you to 
&gt;have to push harder on the brake pedal in my post yesterday and I 
&gt;probably should have. The thing to remember is that in a hydraulic brake 
&gt;system, the force you apply to the brake shoes is a result of the amount 
&gt;of pressure (lbs/in^2 or N/mm^2) in the brake fluid. You make the 
&gt;pressure in the brake fluid with the master cylinder. As the diameter of 
&gt;the master cylinder get bigger, the area you are pushing on to make the 
&gt;pressure gets bigger (that's the in^2 and the mm^2, ^2 means squared), 
&gt;so you have to push harder on the pedal just make the same pressure in 
&gt;the system that you had before you put in the bigger diameter master 
&gt;cylinder.
Somehow this seem backwards to me. As I think this through it would seem
to me that 10LBs of pressure on a square inch bore would create 10LBs
per square inch. If you put 10LBs of pressure on 1/2 square inch bore
you would generate 5LBs per square inch of pressure. Therefore it would
seem a smaller bore would require more foot pressure. Corrections?
