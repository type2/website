Subject: [VB] Re Aridzona copper vs German copper
Message-ID: &lt;381A7716.502F431E_at_uswest_dot_net&gt;

Jim---I would stay with the local AridZona copper as oppossed to the
German copper--
Reason being the Aridzona copper grew up in 115+ degree heat---as you
know the inside of a VW bus in the Summertime {aka Simmertime}in
AridZona has been know to reach record &quot;Highs&quot;  some of the &quot;Highs&quot; are
even due to the temperature!--
Where-as,  German copper, has no idea of the heat factor in
AridZona--And perhaps
no idea as to the &quot;High&quot; factor---uj
