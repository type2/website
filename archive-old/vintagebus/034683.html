 i went to i.t.s transmission in el cajon ca. i was going to go through 
rancho until they gave me a quote i about died . i got a 1967 big nut tranny 
with a 4:12 r&amp;p for 800.00 outright. for a rebuild he would charge like 
450.00. look around first im not saying rancho isnt good but there is better 
prices out there.
