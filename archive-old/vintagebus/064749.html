Subject: Re: [VB] Wheels

Does it have bug or bus 15&quot; rims on it?  The bus rims have 4 wide 
rectangularish slots in them, and are wider than the bug rims.   I have 205 
75 R15s on my 61, and they just squish past the rear rear well, but the 66 
has slightly flared wells.  This size is easy to find.  But tire people says 
it is too wide for the bus rim.   I was thinking of getting 195 15s (metric) 
for my 61 which are narrower and slightly taller than what it has now, but 
they are harder to find (and so cost more).  The first number is the width.  
The second is the ratio of width to height.  so a 75 means the height is 75% 
of 205.  so a 205 70 R15 is shorter than a 205 75 R15.   The last number is 
the rim size.   

metric sizes don't have the middle number.   I think the ratio is always 82.  
165 R15s are bug tires, so I suspect the bus may have bug rims.

&lt;&lt; Per advise of this list I am going to buy some larger tires for my son's 66
 bus. He curently has 15&quot; 165's
 I wanted to put 15&quot; 205's or 215's what I do not know/understand is the
 third number 65's, 70's, 75's?!?! Which will &quot;fit&quot; the wheel wells of a bus
 Thanks
