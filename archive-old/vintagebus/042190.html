&gt; We safety wire all hose clamps because some of the metal hose parts are

&gt; hose Scary!

Fix for this:

Clean both the tube and the hole with spray carb cleaner and make  sure
that it is clean and dry.

Use a flat file and roll the metal tube back and forth on a flat surface
to put a bit of knurl on the part of the tube that goes into the hole.

Mix up a bit of JB-weld according to the instructions.

Smear this lightly on the knurled end of the tube.

Gently tap the tube into the hole.  The JB-weld will form a bead around
the tube where it goes into the hole.

Let it cure for a couple of days.

I do this if the tube can be pulled out of the hole with pliars.  Better
safe than sorry!
