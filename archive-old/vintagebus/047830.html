&lt;&lt; Does anyone know what is the correct heater box for a '59 36hp? I have
 two sets of heater boxes, one set where the box is very rectangular,
 and another set is a bit more &quot;round&quot;. What year did they change the
 36hp boxes?  &gt;&gt;
Hi Phil,
If these heater boxes have the J-tubes sticking out of them they should be 
for both 25&amp;36 HP engines from about 1950.  The squarish ones seem to be from 
1950 and where used up to about 1957.  The rounder ones started out in about 
1956 and went through the rest of stock 36 HP production.  It seems that VW 
had two suppliers of  heater boxes and J-tubes for a two or three year span.
 
 &lt;&lt;Both boxes bolt up correctly on a 36hp.  The J-tubes are the same on both. 
 Also what are they worth?   &gt;&gt;
We have seen them sell for $5.00 and $80.00 each depending on condition, 
location and demand.   Eric&amp;Barb
