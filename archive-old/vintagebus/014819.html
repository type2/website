:  timing is on

But &quot;on&quot; for what?  The timing is specific to several bits in the
engine, including crank and cams.  If it's completely stock for some
particular year, then timing it for that year's the right thing, but
otherwise, you may have to hunt around to find where it's happiest at.

:  carb recently rebuilt

This sounds suspicious.  I'd bet the problem's in here.  Either in the
form of a bit of something partially blocking a port, the choke not
being adjusted correctly (or engaged at all), the mixture screw being
out to lunch, etc, etc.  I've caused myself more problems by &quot;fixing&quot;
carbs than everything else I've done put together....
