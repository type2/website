&gt; Tom, how much profit did you get out of your unfinished Barndoor?  

I've lost my ass on every VW I've ever sold...

&gt;Tom your bus is a Kustom.. How many Chrome Yellow buses were built?  

Yup.   But I figured I had some leeway, since it's a panel, and lots of panels
were painted in company colors.

&gt; Streetrods are my future.  And I am fitting right in with those guys.  I plan 

A couple of the guys who own different VW shops here locally are also into street
rods.  Must be some connection.  And I know of several others who've done similar
migrations in the past few years.  Myself, I'm de-emphasizing the bus stuff and
spending more time (and money!) on racing the 911.  My first time trial is next
Tuesday.  I'll keep the bus and faux westy trailer, and I'm passively looking for 
a double cab, but I'm going to shy away from any hard-core restos for a while.
