Hi Casey,
To tighten up the pulley on the fan belt you remove the shims from beteen the 
pulley halfs and insert these shims just behind the rear pulley half.  You 
should have at least eight of these shims and in some cases need up to 
fourteen of them.  You might need a new belt or perhaps a differant sized 
belt.  Whichever way you go make sure you carry at least two spare belts!  
You also really need to get the Bentley reprint of the VW transporter shop 
manual or even a early 1970s Bentley type 1 or 2 service manual so you can do 
some work on your bus properly.    Eric&amp;Barb
