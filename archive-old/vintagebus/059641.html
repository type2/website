45 minutes and the tipper is on the road to the classic.  Through Boise to
meet up with a few of the Bus Pilots, stop in Basque OR to pick up my
co-driver, sleep in Topaz Lake, and then on to Irvine Friday.  Hope to roll
in to the Irvine Crowne Plaza sometime Friday evening.  So, if you are
staying there, look for a green and gray 67 single cab with gaudy rims and
radials!

With a new motor, rebuilt front end, all fluids changed and a fresh greasing
I think it's ready.

BTW, my Italian mother-in-law has named the tipper &quot;Squascizzo&quot; which in her
Italian dialect means &quot;Something old and broken&quot; or &quot;Piece of sh%t&quot;.... she
just doesn't know cool when it hits her in the face  :-)

(that's pronounced &quot;Squaw-sheets-zo&quot;)
