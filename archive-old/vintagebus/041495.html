&gt; Is there any problems with the auto glass silicone causing rust?


If it is coming from an auto glass shop, it is most likely a .urethane.
sealer, not silicone based.

And no, to answer your question, silicone sealers themselves will not
cause rust.  They will not .stop. rust where rust has already begun before
the sealer is applied, either. 

Some non-auto grade silicone sealants may contain chemicals that can react
with either the paint or the metal itself, and are therefor NOT recommened
for usage.


In the automotive sunroof industry silicone is used to seal the trimring
or sunroof frame to the roofskin of the car (to .seal. not hold!!).
Standard procedure after cutting the hole is to apply a special
primer-sealer to the fresh metal edge (as well as the edge between paint
and metal!) before applying any silicone, or installing the sunroof frame.
this is done, of course, after a good cleaning of the area involved.


If this is not done there is a possibility of rust, either from areas that
the silicone somehow managed to not cover, or from moisture one may trap
against the bare metal with the silicone.


&gt; I would be worried about this stuff they inject rusting out the channel under 
&gt; the window frames.


The urethane sealers that they use are specially designed for this purpose
(sealing glass/rubber/metal to prevent water seepage), and will not
_dot_cause. rust.

Again, though, if the surface they are being applied to is not completely
derusted and sealed beforehand, they will not prevent the area from
rusting.



Most of the rust that one finds under rubber seals, though, has another
real cause.  Vibration and lack of drainage.


Water and dirt work their way past the seal and the metal, and find that
they are stuck under the seal, on the window ledge.  As you drive, the
vibration causes the glass and seal to movve back and forth (slightly
now!).  Over time the dirt that has been trapped under the seal rubs
through the paint and sealant, and finds bare metal.  (Of course, the
water that has been sitting here all this time as well only quickens the
process by softening the paint!)

Now the water that has collected can begin to do its work on the bare
metal beneath.  It only takes one smaallll  spot to start to lead to the
eventual rotting of the entire window frame.

Also, not just dirt and grit, but SALT, either from the air or from the
roads can find its way down there!!


I will shut up now.;)
