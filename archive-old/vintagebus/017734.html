You hear me bitching, and I live in Georgia, which I
keep hearing in the news has the cheapest fuel in the
land. We range from about $1.29 to $1.41 for regular,
and up to about $1.75 for Super. I have to laugh about
this, since it seems to make my V-dub cheaper to drive
than my motorcycle, which requires 91+.

&gt; have

&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Where are you getting gas for $1.29?  We're over $2
&gt; at many gas stations here 
&gt; in So Cal.
&gt; Under a dollar is gone for good here and at the rate
&gt; the prices are going up 
&gt; here, under two dollars will be a thing of the past,
&gt; sooner than later.  :(
