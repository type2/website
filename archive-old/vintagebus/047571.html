Hi all,
Small ass world. Clayton is my next town over. I'm from Concord, and now 
officially reside in Martinez. Even smaller world is that I also have a 1963 
deluxe 15 window that I purchased under 6 years ago.

Seth, if you need any help or have question on putting your 15 window back 
together send me an e-mail. I'm pretty available all the time for questions 
or help.
I'd like to take a look at your bus some time if possible. If your bus is the 
next VIN from mine, I'd love to buy it from you. Every time I see another 63 
bus I see how close the VIN is to mine.

Good luck
Dave Barnes
