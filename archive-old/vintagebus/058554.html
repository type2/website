&gt; those of you who have traveled with a tilt before.  Does it make a lot of
&gt; difference in power and/or mileage with the tilt on?  Seems like the 12&quot; or so
&gt; it stands above the cab would catch a lot of wind.  Trying to decide if I'm
&gt; going to drive with the canvas on or not on my trip to OCTO/Classic from FL.
&gt; Any other considerations?

Dan,

I've traveled thousands of highway miles w/ a tilt on my DC and haven't
noticed much difference w/ top speed, but definitely a difference w/ cross
winds and big headwinds.  Supposedly top speed is about 5 mph less, but I
haven't noticed a major drop in gas mileage although I'm not to AR about
keeping track of mileage either.

There's nothing funner(well almost nutin) than cruising down the highway w/
your &quot;covered wagon thing&quot; on the back and having people point at
you/wave/high five/ etc. as you go by!!  In any event, those tilts are
made/priced to be used! Use It!!
