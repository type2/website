Eric &amp; Barb...Thanks for your inquiry, I did apply white lithium grease to
the inside diameter of the bushing, and smeared a little extra on the shaft
end once the shaft was seated in the bushing. I'm not sure the bushing I
installed first was the correct inside diameter, it seemed too large on the
inside, and fit rather easily in the trans housing when I installed it.
This time I seated the shaft, tightened down the bottom nut on the starter
and checked the fit between the shaft and the bushing. It seemed fine.
Then I used a socket to take up the slack in the long top bolt and tightened
the nut down. Hooking my jumper cables up to my battery, I grounded the
black cable and touched the positive to the leads on the solenoid. The
starter spun fine. I rolled the engine back in, buttoned it up and hooked
the wires up, reinstalled the battery, took it off the jackstands and hit
the key. SUCCESS. I drove it around and started it successfully six or seven
times. Today I drove it to work and back, making a couple of stops along the
way, each time it started normally...I also have the RMM hot start relay
installed. Hope this helps someone else with the same problems.
-John.

&gt;Hi John,
&gt;When you installed the starter with the new bushing did you make sure to
&gt;grease the inside of the bushing or apply some grease to the starter tip
that
&gt;goes into the bushing?  &gt;
