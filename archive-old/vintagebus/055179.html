Subject: : 80 hours later


&gt;    Well it's done, I finally got my 60 double cab painted. Well sort of.
&gt; After 80 hours of work we got the whole underneath painted.  Now I only
&gt; have the interior and the body to do and it's done, oh ya, I forgot
&gt; putting it back together.
&gt;    After numerous attempts to have the original chassis color matched I
&gt; gave up. There are at least 3 different colors on the chassis of the DC.
&gt; These are all original. The heater tubes are a different color then the
&gt; rest of the chassis and then you have the over spray from the original GRU
&gt; paint, ahhhggg. So what I came up with, actually a painter friend of mine
&gt; was some INDUSTRIAL gray paint, you know the kind they paint machinery
&gt; with, we lightened it and added some flattener agent to it and it came out
&gt; good. It took a gallon of paint to just paint the underside of the bus.
&gt; This paint goes on thick and dries hard as a rock, cure time 2 to 3 days.
&gt; The next step will be to paint the front beam (I'm putting a 67 with the
&gt; big brakes and sway bar on it) and to paint the trans and axles to match
&gt; (big nut RGB's with a 412/82 4th trans (my 3.88 is going in the 15 window
&gt; with small nut RGB's), so the work goes on. My plans are to have it DONE
&gt; by BBB VI, I'll have my whole 60's line-up there, DD panel, WESTY, 15
&gt; window and the DC all 60's.
&gt;    I prepped the underside by wire wheeling first, then wiping the whole
&gt; underside with lacquer thinner, treated the surface rust with RUST MORT
&gt; then painted it.
