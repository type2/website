&gt; driven it at night (when it's colder) because of the dumn turnsignals/brake

&gt; - does anyone else have a 6V  type 2 w/ 58-61 round glass taillights and if so
&gt; how do they work for you?

Otto der Pritschenwagen &lt;http://www.bobrk_dot_com/otto/&gt;, a '59 single
cab, has a set of these, although they have replacement plastic KDF
lenses. And they do not work well at all. The brake lites only work if
you really stomp on the brake pedal hard, and even then, no one can
see them in the day time. The turn signals are really bad, with one
side flashing at a completely different speed than the other. If you
are looking at the taillights while the turn signals are on, it looks
like the turn signal filament is sapping the voltage out of the tail
light filament. The grounding's pretty good, but I think perhaps water
gets in there through the old holes conveniently cut in the rear
corners so it probably needs to be checked again. I will probably do a
12v conversion, as I'd rather be safe than totally resto, and since my
bus already has a tunnel case tranny (reduction boxes intact), it'll
never be resto anyway.
