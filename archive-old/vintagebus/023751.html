he bearings for the following prices:
&gt; 
&gt; 6302    $14.00
&gt; 6306    $14.00
&gt; Roller  $42.00 sorry, I couldn't remember the #
&gt; 

I just hit up my parts supplier for the expensive ones, the outermost
bearing, which off the top of my head is VW part number 211-405-283 (
might be 211-407-283), and he usually sells them to shops wholesale for
$35. I needled him down to $29 and bought two. If wholesale is $35, and
usual markup is 60-75%, then you are looking at $62.  Ouch!
