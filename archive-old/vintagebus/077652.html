Subject: Re: [VB] RE: [T2] New house guest HELP/update5

The Swiss brothers are enroute to the Grand Canyon now. They have lost 14 
days of traveling time due to the bus mishaps since they got it. But it does not 
impact the final goal much: The goal is to reach Montreal, Quebec by Dec. 
20th, when Patrick's gf would fly in from Europe to meet and travel with them till 
January, when they will fly home from NYC together.. Between now and Dec. 
20th they want to visit all the places along the Pacific coast. Marcel, boss of 
his 2 Huskies, would fulfill his goal of visiting Alaska (by train) during this 
time. Because of the northbound direction the brothers are not lingering much 
around the American Southwest. After a day or so in the GC they will double 
quick to Las Vegas. Then it's Fresno CA from there. Still a bit of mysterious 
oi leak on the engine, but they're confident they will make it back to Cali. 

Great guests in whatever vehicle they choose, and to their credit they chose 
the bus. I am sure we as a community can make it up for them, where the loss 
of time is replaced by VW hospitality.
