Rob,  I still have my transmission, just waiting for
the most deserving bus before I use it.

The reason I have a new engine in my '61 Westy is that
I blew the one I built previously (poor quality heads,
I think) on the way home from BBBV.  When I bought my
'59, I put a distributer and carb on the engine that
sat in it in the woods for 18-20 years, and drove it
to Jerome.  If you run into engine trouble near
Albuquerque on your trip to the Classic, I've got an
unknown quality engine I'll be glad to loan you!

JP

&gt; VW Travelers
&gt;     Does every one who goes anywhere have a new
&gt; engine.  I noticed that
&gt; Ronnie in Prescott had a new engine in the wife's
&gt; car.  JP in Co has one in
&gt; his Westy (where did your Havasu trannie go?)  Hell
&gt; I am getting ready to
&gt; drive 1800 miles in the engine that came with the
&gt; truck that I bought last
&gt; Fall.  Am I supposed to be worried or something? 
&gt; You guys that stay home
&gt; need not reply.  Thanks
&gt; Rob Laffoon
