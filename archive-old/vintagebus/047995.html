 Has anyone done and been driving a 12-6 set up like
 this with long term good results or not?  Any
 ideas...I wanna cover all options before I pull the
 engine and start over.

yes I have run a 6V starter in a 12V tranny.  yes the bushing is very thin,   
I converted the truck back to 6V.             There was no problem.   Drove 
it around for 6 months or so pretty much was my daily driver (trucks are fun)
