Never had to use one on a road trip but it has come in handy?  I feel
sorry for the poor S.O.B. that it came handy on!!!!!!
Personally, I like the little 9mm Derringer.  It's so much more
unobtrusive when carried in your back pocket!

&gt; I use one.  Theory is the impact can damage bearings or whatever in the rear
&gt; and never have replaced it, but will get one and one road trips take it with
&gt; the 36mm one as well (FW nut) on the 1/2 drive slide bar and the 6&quot; cheater
&gt; pipe.     I never had to use it on a road trip one my own vehicle so far, but
&gt; it has come in handy.
