&gt;hey, i bet you can find links with the simpsons

Okay, I have to chime in now.  :)  As an English teacher, I can't tell you 
how many connections there are between the Simpsons and good 
literature.  Whenever possible, I try to find an episode that relates to 
what we're reading in class.  Just last week I managed to bring in a copy 
of their Halloween episode with Poe's &quot;The Raven&quot;.  They loved it!

&gt;actually, you gave me the germ of an idea.. i'm going to transfer my VW 
&gt;factory videos onto dvd, put a player in the benchseat back and make my 
&gt;kid watch THAT on long trips =]

If you burn them to DVD, can I get copies?  :)
