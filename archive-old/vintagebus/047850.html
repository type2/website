Hi Thom,
We went through our Circular Letters from VOA to thier dealers and found on
this subject Circular # 55, of May 1956.  It describes the procedure of
checking VWs for complete parts and any damage.

   All cars are delivered with a sealed and wired accessory box containing
the following items: Spare tire, windshield wipers, brackets, manuals, tools,
hub caps, fan belt, jack, jack handle, tee handle, and side mirror
(Transporters only) and spare key.  In addition, two sealed beams, two
parking bulbs and two sealed beam connectors are placed in the front luggage
compartment.  The agent accepting delivery is fully responsible for
inspecting the above mentioned items.

   So it looks like the bus came with the mirror for the one side and
probably had the arm installed at the factory since it is not mentioned in
this package.
