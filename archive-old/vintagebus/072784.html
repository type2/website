&gt; I've read the archives (mostly posts from Eric&amp;Barb :) so I have an idea 
&gt; of what I'm getting myself into, but I have a couple of questions:

yes, E&amp;B were a great help when I went through mine :)

&gt; 	a) it seems like I have to remove weld/drill&amp;screw-out the plug on
&gt; 		the inner RGB half in order to remove it: is this the case
&gt; 		or can i pull the RGB and disassemble on the bench?

Someone else can confirm this. I didn't rebuild my RGBs but did
replace seals &amp; gaskets when I pulled &amp; installed 2 trannies in my 66.
I believe that the axle tube is a press fit (don't know for sure b/c I
didn't seperate mine). Assuming this to be true you will have to
disconnect the axle tube from the transmission to remove it from the
bus. So you have to remove it anyway &amp; can't simply pull the rgb off
the axle tube. You CAN split the RGB case on the bus &amp; replace some
seals, but to get to the back side of the case where the plug is
requires you to unbolt the 4 bolts that hold it to the arm. So the
point of this rambling is I don't believe you can just pull the RGB
only you have to pull the axle as well. Someone also suggested taking
a sheet metal screw, drill in &amp; use a hammer to pry this plug out. I
noticed that wolfsburgwest carries metal plugs, but I have no
experience with these.

&gt; 	c) along these lines, if I wanted to replace the RGB instead of 
&gt; 		rebuilding, would I need the above tools, or will it just
&gt; 		pop right off?

I believe you pretty much have to dissemble the entire thing to get to
a state which you can press off the axle tube. but if the RGB you can
get still have the tubes connected it's pretty simple. I would
recommend drilling/tapping the 4 mounting holes for longer bolts as
E&amp;B suggested to me. They are something like 35-40% longer.

&gt; 	d) are there other gotchas to be concerned about?
&gt; 
&gt; I'm planning on rebuilding both RGBs at once, although I have a source for 
&gt; two used RGBs which I might just pick up and pop on if it's easier, while 
&gt; waiting until I have time to rebuild mine.  Thoughts on this?

I'd do this, gives you time to work on them, plus what if you have
some really munged up gears (i.e. metal in drained oil as above) &amp;
suddenly you don't quite have all the parts you need :(

&gt; I do have the Bentley's, but I confess, most of the scanning I did of the 
&gt; rebuild process has already slipped through my brain.

It's scary untill you actually split one &amp; look at it. Unlike engines
which seem to sometimes need some magic to keep running well the gear
system makes complete sence when dissembled. I'm glad I had to go
through mine &amp; feel much better w/ them now that I know exactly what
is going on in there.

good luck.
