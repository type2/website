I've used a bay window closet in a split before.  If you don't trim it, it will stick out past the rear cargo door.  I took the closet apart in the middle and cut out about a 6in section, then bolted it back together.  It worked, but was kind of ugly. I've never tried to use the later rear seat that goes all the way across, but the folding bed in my 71 looks identical to the one I used in my 67 with the bay closet.
The biggest thing is making sure you have all the pieces secured to the floor, walls, etc. They will shift, ask me how I know...
