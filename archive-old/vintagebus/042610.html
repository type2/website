Actally, 
this list originated because the original type2 list (covering all
aircooled busses and vanagons 50-83) had too many messages.  People who
owned splitties got tired of reading aout fuel injection, and people who
owned FI busses got tired or reading about reduction boxes.

so, as far as i am concerned this list is about pre 68 busses more or
less.  Vintagebus seemed as good a name as any.  I am not hardcore
vintage, i drive a 71 bus now, and am looking for a splitty that is as
rust free and unoriginal as possible to build a resto custom daily driver.
im not going to put a chevy v8 in anything, but i might lower it, or
camperize it, or tint the windows, or ?  Thats why i want an unoriginal
bus, so i can express my creativity.  Personally i wouldnt put a v8 in a
bus, i like the little aircooled engines, they get me going.  Aircooled is
just too cool to start in with a radiator, but if the guy want's to do
it, ill cringe, ill tell him not to but in the end its his bus.  At some
point a day will come when original busses are in garages and in museums
and the custom ones are left on the road.  A perfect example is the street
rod community.  All the original 30's and 40's cars seem to be in museums,
in garages, or on trailers. but the custom people drive theirs everywhere.
(hell at junebg in 97 we shared a campground with a bunch of em..)  I plan
on driving my bus as long as possible, originality be dammned.  When i
last checked new redux box swingaxles are NLA, as are new drums for
certain years of busses. When the pool of suitable used ones runs out, we
will have a choice, park or customize (or spend ungodly bucks on NOS ones,
hehe)

Vintage originality isnt my bag, baby.  But i find this list to be helpful
and informative even to me.

peas,

Steve
