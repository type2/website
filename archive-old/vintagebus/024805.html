WOW !!! Woke up this morning to 27  e-mails about my SC roof rack. Thank
you  for so many nice comments.  Almost all the posts did ask the big
question of  &quot;how much &quot;?  Well....... Tom Connor ( the fabricator ) has
a long list of styles and options for all  TYPE II  VW's  ..You can have
yourself a custom rack.


Tom is a very nice guy ; give him a call    Tom Connor, Dear Park  ,

Good Luck
