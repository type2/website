hello all,

i am in the process of buying a 61 sans tranny, and a 67 tranny and front
beam to put in there...(the 61 has a beam, but i want f/r brakes to match)

the thing is, i am not sure what all i need from the 67...

will the shifting mech from teh 61 hook to the 67 nosecone, or is it
different?

it will bolt right up.
.........
are parking brake cables the same, or do i need some of the 67 parts to
get it all to work?
 -- - -  -
the parking brake cables are different, but that is cause the lever in the 
bus are different.  Think the ones in the bus will work.   I have a 61 with 
what you are doing in it but for the life of me I can't tell you what brake 
cables it has.   the way they attach 67-67, 63 and earlier to backing plates 
is differnt.  sorry to be unhelpful.

since i am going to 12v, i planned on getting the 67 wiper assembly
will it bolt right in?

no.    I have seen it done though.   you would have to mash the defrost tube 
somewhat, as the 66/67 wiper bracket fitd differntly.
