Subject: Re: [VB] Re: shifter adjustment

lossen the two 13mm bolts holding the shift stick down.  Using a rubber 
mallet, whack the bas eof the shift towards th drivers door (LHD).   snug 
bolts down, and check shifting.

I have my shifting suddenly shift on me spontaneously once.  I couldn't find 
1st or 2nd.   then I realised if I pushed straight down like going to 
reverse, then hunted tfor the gears,  I could find them.  SO I re adjusted 
the shift plate so the stick could rotate to the left all the way. This was 
during a road trip, so I was so the tranny was running for hourse in the 
heat.  dunno.  Also in my 61 which less than 10K miles before had a rebuildt 
tranny and NOS shift bushings installed, and has a very small shift throw.

&lt;&lt; answer somewhere. ;-)  anyway i had my rear shifter bushing replaced last
 year and it has affected how the actual shifter gets into the gear.  i keep
 getting 3rd instead of 1st.
