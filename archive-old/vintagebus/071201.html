&gt; I often visited local small town grave yards just out of curiosity.
&gt; You can learn a lot in grave yards.


Stan:
My son recently completed a restoration of a small local graveyard that had
been forgotten over the years.
He did this as an Eagle Scout Service Project. Through the research he
completed for the restoration we were able to discover that the first person
buried there, and on whose land the cemetery was founded was the first white
settler in our county outside of the residents of the county seat. This man
whose name was Zacariah Melugin was a Sergeant in the Black Hawk Wars and
served for awhile with Abraham Lincoln.
The local newspaper picked up the story and over the months we heard from
people as far away as Texas and New Jersey (we are in Illinois), who have
ancestors buried in this graveyard, which was active from 1842 until 1883.
When the project was finished, we took our '66 Westfalia out to the site and
camped on the day after Halloween. Unfortunately, none of the cemetery
inhabitants paid us a visit, but we speculated that if they did they would
be kindly toward us because we worked so hard to bring their resting place
back to a respectable condition.
