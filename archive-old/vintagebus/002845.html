If anyones interested, I'm going to check the bus out in couple of
hours armed with my digital camera.  That is if someone hasn't bought it
already.  The lady I spoke to says she's been getting calls from as far away
as Pennsylvania (list member?).  Extra info I got was that it was parked in
the garage with
rod knock back in '87.  It got moved out of the garage and under a tarp from
'94 til now.  I'll know more later.
