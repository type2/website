Markus:
The JC Whitney article you mention works ok.  I had a small alominum
block machined for fittings for the oil cooler lines and had it drilled
to fit the sensor, which I epoxied into place.  The block is small
enough that it heats up to oil temperature quickly (don't mount it
directly to a large heat sink like a fender well unless you inulate
it).  Gene Gerg offers a complete setup, I've not seen one.  The
downside to this is, of course, yet another pair of fittings in the oil
hose assemblies.
Let me know how you make out.
Dave
