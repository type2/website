Subject: Re: Battery suggestions
Date: Fri, 30 Oct 1998 01:30:11 PST


&gt;being cheap myself I refused the Sears' guy's recommendation on the 
costlier
&gt;battery, and got a cheaper one.  (also from Sears, just about the 
bottom of
&gt;the line).    Worked for years.  :)   
&gt;
&gt;
I am thinking this...
A bus is a bug engine. How many cranking amps can it possibly need?
A cheaper battery makes sense.
However....I wish I could find another battery like the one I have now. 
I have an everready that came with, get this, a free jumpstart or tow! I 
carry a card with a 1 800 number that will send out a tow truck if my 
battery, OR ignition system should ever fail. Best darn investment I 
could ever make IMHO. And it was CHEAPER at the time then any other 
battery. I cant find this anymore (wonder why?) I have never had to use 
this though. Even when I depleted the battery to empty, I always seem to 
be able to push start the bus, which takes less time then finding a 
phone.
Side note...My dad bought a battery for his truck that is gauarenteed 
forever! Dumb idea on the manufactures part...He gets it replaced every 
three years for free!
Given the pushability of the bus and the low torque to starting ratio of 
the bug motor, I would look for a medium price range battery.
