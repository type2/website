&gt; If you're really sure that the far right fuse is good, look at the top
&gt; terminal for that fuse.  See that really fat red wire?




Speaking of that big fat red wire, recently I've had my front kick panels
off (fancy simulated wood grain paneling) and have temporarily been taking
that wire off of the fuse block as an paranoid anti theft measure.  I plan
to install a kill switch.  should I wire it to that main hot, or take out
the ignition switch and wire it to that?  What have people done in the
past.  I get nervous when I take the DC to the HD and leave it out there all
alone.
