Subject: [VB] Door Seals - WW vs. German
To: Robert Davis &lt;RDAVIS_at_sbch_dot_org&gt;
Cc: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Choice depends on if the bus is going to be a keeper
or not. We paid for the WW brand (or WCM I don't
remember which~ used a little of each) as repop
product was the only thing that was available. Put it
all in the Westy Resto from Hell. Five years and forty
thousand miles later in Phoenix weather some of the
seals on the doors are getting dry, scale-like on the
surface and self destructing all together.
The price seemed like it should have been German. ;-)!
