Subject: Re: [VB] Has anyone made this trip?

That sounds great, I hope they replay it soon. I have done a few parts of it in CA but never the entire stretch the whole way. I did the SF to Oregon stretch once and it was beautiful. Make sure your steering is good as well as your brakes, there are a lot of tight corners and the farther north you go the more logging trucks there are!
