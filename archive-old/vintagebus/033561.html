Hi Dworkin,
For that at least once if not twice a year take a set of screw drivers and 
turn each pre-1961 connection screws out 1/2 turn and back in to wear off the 
corrosion even connections well inside the VW.  Do not forget to do the same 
to the semaphore mounting screw to keep up the grounding connection!  Buying 
and applying corrosion control materials is definitely a good idea also.
