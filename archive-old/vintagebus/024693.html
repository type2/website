Subject: Peach State rally

Hi -
I am relatively new to the list.  I have thoroughly enjoyed visiting all
your websites and loved seeing all the beautiful buses.  I noticed a
reference to the Peach State Transporter Rally?  If anyone has more info
on this like where and when and do they have a website, please let me
know.  I would like to go and it sounds like it could be in my area.
thanks and happy holidays
SALLY
