Head Couint!!!   Whos goin to this fine testement of redneck ingenuity.
This one is gonna be a blast, not to mention probably the last campout of
the year unfortunately.  Last years winner, The Big 10 Inch, launched a
punkin 3,694 feet.  Thats over a mile!!!  They also happened to use a bus
for target practice as well last year :O  This will make a great annual VW
event, show your support!   Heres a repost from Dave parsons original post
for the event.
