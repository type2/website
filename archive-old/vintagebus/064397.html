Subject: Bus Shifter Differences

Can someone please explain the difference between a '60-'65 Bus shifter and
the later '66 and up versions.  Does the earlier version extend further below
the cab floor?  Might sound silly at first, but what would I need to do to get
a '66 and up shifter to work on a '60 Bus.

Thanks,
Aaron
