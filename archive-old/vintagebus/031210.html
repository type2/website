&gt;What radio came with the 67 buses?  In the archives there seemed to be
some difference. I saw sapphire 3 and 5. Also was there a radio block off
plate available in 67 and was it different?  I noticed some of the aftermaket
ones say thru '66.
&gt;
Radios were dealer-installed and thus random.  No 67 would have a Sapphire
III as Sapphire IIIs are 6v.  Yes, 67 has a different block off plate because
the radio hole is larger, it is one bigh rectangle instead of a small hole
with radio post holes on wither side.  There's a 67 block off plate on ebay
right now...

&gt;Which brings up the &quot;pet peeve of the day&quot;.  Why do so many people refer
to split busses as pre-67?  Whats wrong with pre-68?
&gt;
A follish mistake, made by many and frowned upon by all respectable early
Bus owners.  It should be &quot;pre-68&quot; or &quot;67 and earlier&quot;.
