       The problem with temporary fixes is that it may cost you more in the 
long run, than actually taking the time to fix it right.   There are several 
problems of cracked body filler.  First, unless you can see the back side, 
you have no idea how bad the filled dent is.  Second, these cracks have 
allowed moisture in, so now you have rust under body filler.  If you just 
throw more body filler it may help hide the problem, but not cure it.  Given 
the right tools and the time chances are you won't need the body filler 
anyway. (it's faster to metal finish the small dents than it is to fill them)
       As for panel replacement / rust repair  on your bus.   You need to 
practice up with a MIG.  The better welder you are the less heat your going 
to put into the metal.  There are really not short cuts for panel replacement 
/ rust repair.     And if your skills aren't up to it, you could do more 
damage than good.   So you need the time and practice metal to make your 
mistakes on before working on your baby.
       Check you local  college or high school for any body work classes they 
may offer.   
                                                                           
Peace,
