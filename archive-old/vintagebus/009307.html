hey ya list

So I was driving the other day and I thought my brakes seemed - odd!  Like I
had to push too hard.  So I noticed a couple days later that my brake pedal
was about half way down and wouldn't come up on it's own.  Not what I would
call mushy (a muir term?) but when I pulled the pedal out the brakes would
stop my bus with out my pushing the pedal done as far as I some times would
have to.  So I was a little worried and checked my brake fluid - it seemed a
little low.  So I topped it up and drove a bit.  My plan is to adjust my
brakes and bleed them tomorrow. The PO replaced the master cylinder and I'm
quite sure all of my shoes are quite good but is there anything I should
check on my master cylinder?  I'm sure it only has .... about 2,000 miles on
it but I guess I ought to check it out and at least find what model it is.

Anyway - TIA
