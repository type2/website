   I am new to this list.  I am considering buying a
 '62 bus and would like some advice as to wether or not
 the $1200 asking price is reasonable. Here's what I
 know;
 
   '62, from Georgia, not licensed for 15+ years
    Body solid underneath, all the window rubber is
 shot so there is damage to the bottoms of the
 passenger side doors and cargo floor from water
 collecting, plenty of surface rust- rot only in door
 bottoms as mentioned above - rear wheel wells cut for
 larger tires( includes repair panels)
   Has good running 1600 DP, runs and drives nice, no
 shifting problems- exhaust shot
   Converted to 12V somewhere in it's history
   no- bumpers
   has flip-up hatch type sunroof- NO POP-TOP
   Interior has been stripped of all fabric, including
 headliner, rear &quot;camper&quot; cabinets and ice chest remain
 and are in fair shape.  Front seats ok too
   All side windows are pop-out type.  
   Overall intact, all necesary parts (lights mirrors
 etc are there. 
  15&quot; wheels w/ spare 
  Includes paperwork to register
 
 Any advice or ideas are appreciated.  I haven't found
 too many in this condition to make a fair comparison. 
 The plan is for a daily driver, not a show bus.
  &gt;&gt;
sounds reasonable for a needs some upkeep daily driver type bus.   Is it one 
of those early westy with the flip top?   Cool! 

When you get it do the delayed maintenance thing, including changing engine 
oil, tranny oil, make sure it has good tranny boots, inspect brakes/ replace 
hoses and whatever else is needed.  I know a couple people who killed trannys 
by driving them dry- they had never checked the tranny oil since buying the 
bus, and there wasn't any.
