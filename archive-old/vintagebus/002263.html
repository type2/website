&gt;suspect the former).  I made a puller out of a old screwdriver (check out
NQ's
&gt;site I got the idea from him) and punched a hole in the plug and pried it

Thanks for the plug (no pun intended.)  The pictures can be found at
http://home.ispi_dot_net/~elassley.bie/redux/reduxtech.htm although I pulled my
cap in a way that saved it for reuse but was by no means quick (the welding
thing requireda trip to a friend's house since my welder isn't wired up.)
