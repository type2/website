but that's what Wolfgang does, reverses the spindels bends the control arms
and welds them up, I'm going to try and do this myself to save some bucks on
my new CUSTOM bus I'm going to build.

&lt;&lt; Also I have heard rumor (don't know of anyone that's actually done it), 
that
 you can swap the spindles in the front from the left side to the right, and
 vica/versa to get 4-5&quot; of drop without affecting the camber, or bumpsteer.
&gt;&gt;

Actually there is a guy with I think a 67 hard top deluxe that lives in
Vegas 
and works at a casino there.  Its lime green and white.  He reversed the 
spindles on his but from the description of the work, I would rather just
buy 
some dropped spindles.  He had to cut the spindles and reweld, i wont go
into 
detail because I kinda think it's rather rediculous.  Alot of work and time 
when you could just buy spindles. JMHO

See you all at Jerome!
