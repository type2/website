Craig's new first-generation aluminum T1 case engine 
after a few break-in miles is a total disaster !
Photos show abnormal bearing wear patterns.
Prior to disassembly, the complaint was a
bottom-end knock,in addition to a significant
amount of metal in the oil. 
Is there any wear on the cam gear teeth?
Is the backlash the same as before ?
Was a piston or rod installed wrong ?
Did you plastigage ?
The Schneider cam needs more than a shimmed stock spring.
New lifters will rock heads when held to the light. Flat is bad.
Might as well add a full set of bearings to the rebuild cost.
Have a machinist mic the cam and crank bearing bores.
Send the photos to Rimco and see if they still think the case 
is good. They OK'd it with all that casting slag ?!
Maybe you could sell it to GEX !
