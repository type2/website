also- through 52 sometimes they has piano hinge vent wings. EVIDENTLY THIS 
WAS A REALLY BAD DESIGN AND IT DID A POOR JOB OF VENTILATING oops sorry, so 
ve wised up after they probably got some negative feedback about vent design, 
and did the pivot style vent wings, in which a small window actually does a 
pretty dern good job of moving ar around.   from 52 one they had the pivot 
style vents wings, so you have a larger amount of buse s than you thought to 
get the frames from.   The logos on the glasschanged in mid 56 i think, 55s 
have te same large logoes  as 54, but by 58 or so it settled into the small 
sekurit logo glass.  and if yu don't really care what logo glass you have, 
remmember some of these anal retentive people with barndoors or whatever who 
are trying to get the orignal pieces and would like the large logo sekurit 
glass.

um- cybertom-  what pieces are needed?

They had different style latches (3) and some had no scoops, big scoops, or 
small scoops.

&gt; PS: Are all non-barndoor splitty doors and vent windows interchangeable?
vent windows are all pretty much the same...

doors themselves:
55-early 61 same
mid 61-early 64 same..
64-67 same

55-60 and 64-67 had through the glass latches for sliding windows, in
between they had the crappy laminated stuff.

take care,
