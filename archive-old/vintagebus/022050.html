Subject: truck bed patch bits
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

just noticed that a piece I had cut out of the engine access lid from that 80 
(vanagon) westy I did the upright engine transplant in has the flat 
corregations like a truck.    I am not sure they are exactly the same, but if 
you need small patch pieces for your rusty truck bed, vanagons are so more 
likely to be found in a junkyard.    chop em up!!!!!
