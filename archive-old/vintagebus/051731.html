Subject: Re: [VB] Changing axle boots


Here I go again... why put the seam in the boots at that angle rather than 
TDC?  Does this alleviate stress on the seam due to vertical motion on the 
wheel during use?

&gt;
&gt;Hi Thomas,
&gt;You do not need to get the axles level to install the axle boots.  The main
&gt;thing is to install the split boots with the seam 30-45 degrees from TDC.  
&gt;If
&gt;you have the seam on the forward side of the axle you can replace it later
&gt;with the engine in easily.  Well fairly easily....
