I've seen that bus in that pinball machine.
The rockers and floor are so rusted out it would take
and entire donor bus from an ERTL or a Wal Mart set to
replace them. Besides, the entire interior, deluxe
trim and corner windows have already been stripped
off, and it's missing the middle seat.

&gt; In hopes to kill the Walmart Bus issue I would like
&gt; to bring on the next item for debate.  In a student
&gt; lounge at the university I work at there is a
&gt; pinball machine with a split window bus in it. 
&gt; Unfortunately the pinball game is called Junk Yard. 
&gt; Anyway, since I am borrowing the digital camera for
&gt; the weekend I took some pictures of it.  You can see
&gt; it at:
&gt; 
&gt; http://www.iusb_dot_edu/~kahlgrim/pinball.htm
&gt; 
&gt; I haven't played the machine, the university does
&gt; not own the machine but if someone is willing to pay
&gt; lots of money for Walmart Buses and real buses
&gt; without bumpers and you need this pinball machine
&gt; for your collection, then I would be happy to see if
&gt; the machine could be for sale.  Of course I would
&gt; expect the standard 1000% mark up.  Seriously, it's
&gt; Friday, I'm going home shortly but if you are
&gt; interested I will respond to your email on Monday.
&gt;
