 Also, a PO drilled a hole in the dash where later models have a gas 
 gauge.  This forces me to put a gas gauge in.  A friend gave me a 
 tank with a sender unit.  I would also like to keep the original set 
 up with the option of running on reserve (the best of both worlds).  I 
 was disappointed to see that the original reserve mechanism on 
 the tank was gone.  Is there a source for these?  Anybody 
 interested in selling me one?

I think Wolfberg West has them- you can attach one to the batoom of a sending
unit type gas tank I believe.

It was an option in 61 to have a gas gauge, though the face is differentthan
the 62-67 style- reads EMPTY  to   FULL    (or also in German).  Or you could
weld it up and dump the gas guage concept completely.

  In regards to painting the bus.  It was originally Sealing Wax Red 
 and a Gray (SR and BGR).  I want it to be sealing wax red and 
 white (or is it off white?).  My painter is going to use ppg paint.  
 How do find the codes for these colors?  
  &gt;&gt;
the beige grey is actually usually regarded as a white (or off white)

a word of caution- my 65 (velvet green/bluewhite) westy was repainted with PPG
paintmixed to code- and the bluewhite was off- much too green.   It got
repainted- the white did.  Check the paint colour agianst the bus (hidden spot
is good, especially if you polish it- usually closer to original due to less
weathering/sun fading).   The paint store I went to had a list of paint
recipes for old cars, and my colours were on it.

as for the cable on the left- did your bus have a gas (h)eater?
