new dillema is trying to figure out what my new bus is.  It's a '66 that
has 3 windows after the drivers window.

Ruby,

With 3 side windows, your bus is either a Kombi or a Standard Microbus.  
The big giveaway to tell the difference between the two models is 
whether or not there is a heater outlet tube inside the cargo area 
underneath where the rear seat would be.  No heater tube = Kombi, 
heater tube = Standard Microbus.

There are other differences but this would be the &quot;holy grail&quot; in 
your deciphering process.

The VIN number is in 3 places on a '66.  Are you sure all 3 are gone?  
There is one on the forward bulkhead behind the back of the passenger 
seat, one on the passenger side of the overhead fresh air box, and one 
at the seam where the rear apron meets the horizontal engine bay metal 
between the engine and battery area.

Dave
