Subject: Re: [VB] early vs late push button doors?

From: &quot;Karl&quot; &lt;aufever_at_prodigy_dot_net&gt;


&gt; If 64 and 65 are the same as 66, then no, a 67 door latch will not work.
&gt; They may fit but they will not latch correctly.
&gt; The latches are different. The catches are different. The hole in the door
where the latches are are
&gt; different.

Hi Karl, good info - I didn't realise that - they looked the same so I assumed
they would be the same!

Haven't got the 67 doors here with me, but have the catches - my bus is a 66.
The screw holes for the catches look to be in the same place dimensionally -
can you see any reason why I couldn't modify the 67 doors to fit the 66
catches when I weld up the couple of holes that are in the bottom?

Paul
