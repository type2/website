Bus content:
I Think my heat risers are plugged on my Single Port intake manifold.

This being my first SP, i thought i'd ask... can you remove the intake
manifold without pulling the engine? (not a big deal either way, i'd just
like to budget my time appropriately and not bother trying to remove it
in-situ if it is impossible)
 - -- - - 
you can remove the muffler and try to clean out the heat riser with a drill 
till the corners, then a clutch cable past the crners (use drill in reverse 
so you dont break off the wires).   Yes you can remove the manifold w/o 
pulling the motors, but I am not sure if that is easier than pulling it.
