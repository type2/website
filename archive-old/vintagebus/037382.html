&lt;&lt; why is a breaker bar not working? how big is the bar?
 do you have the engine on a bench?
 do you have air compressor and an impact gun?
 are locking it up so the engine doesnt turn?
 i usually just hit hit it with the gun and it comes right off

I have seen a torque meister in use and it is impressive but I dont have one. 
 

My compressor gave up the ghost, and I don't like using that on axle nuts or 
fw nuts anyway.

I do have a 36mm 1/2&quot; drive socket and a 1/2&quot; slide bar and a 6 foot pipe.   
and a flywheel lock.    if the pulling on the pipe only lifts the other side 
of the motor I know it is way too torqued or it is stuck,  and I have to 
round up one (maybe two) large friends to stand on the opposite side of the 
motor.  This has worked for me.  Once I did break a FW bolt, forget how I got 
the stuff apart then, but it did come apart.  Maybe it was cracked and fell 
apart after removal.

but hauling it to a shop that could impact it off is also an option.  cheaper 
than a new tool.
