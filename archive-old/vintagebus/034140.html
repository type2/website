  I do have a small supply of NEW German duel port tin in stock, I have
checked this out and the fit and gauge of steel is excellent, It is my
supplier who told me he imported this from Germany, a small stash was
supposedly found, and I due tend to believe them as if they were liars they
would loose my business. The supply is limited, now if I could only find new
single port tin! Also have new rear small deflector tin (the piece that goes
under the cyl. tin) to deflect air over the cylinders.

  Now on to engine flaps!! I have 2 (complete)original 1966 1500 engines in
my shop, both out of Deluxe buses built 30 days apart, neither have flaps or
appear to ever had them, the church bus engine had never been removed from
bus till I did it, and I do believe the original owner and there were no
signs of wrench or screwdriver marks on the engine. So is 1 of the lost M
codes flap delete, or were west coast delivery buses shipped without them?
In my years of VW work I also had an original 1966 Beetle in my shop with
35800 original miles on it, factory air! and no flaps, this was also
delivered to LA port.Or is it 1500 engines didn't have them!, but the bug
was a 1300.
