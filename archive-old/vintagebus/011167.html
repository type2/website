Subject: Need rear corner inner pieces -any parts buses LA / OC
CC: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

me friends car  (66 Kombi) is at the body shop now.......I thought I could 
find the piece  at OCTO but nothing,

What he needs is the drivers side rear corner pieces, mostly the small 
bracket that the rear apron bolts too, the one with the 2 holes, the 
passenger side is there but the drivers side is missing. There is no number 
in the parts book....
I think the rest can be beat out, Or if someone has that corner.........

the outer skin is usable.........

Any ideas or early buses in Pic-a-part ...........thanks.........
