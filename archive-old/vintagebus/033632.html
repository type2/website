Subject: 55 to 62 Front wheel cylinders

    Just to let everyone know that I got in some more of the Taiwan early
front wheel cylinders. These cost 25 dollars a piece verses 40 dollars for
German. I have tested these now for over a year without a failure or leak.
I would use them and am going to put them on my 60 15 window.

ronnie   just letting you know
