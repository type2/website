David,

After a little more thought and seeing your picture, i
am very certain that you can use the gas tank hold
down bracket from a 64 erra bug.  It is the same part.
 As the the bolt and wing nut, they should be
available at your local FLAPs.  (this is what i did on
my 60 DC.)

My 60 (very early with cut side gates) had the rear
seat mounted with 2 wing nut's on the back and 2 on
the floor.  The back one were OUTSIDE of the lower
base.  I beleave VW changed the base and went to the
rear mounts on the inside somewhere around 61 and then
again changed the base is 64 for the new rear seat
style.  To my knowlege, there are 3 different rear
seat bases so make sure you have the right one.

Matthew
