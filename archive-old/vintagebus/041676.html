Umm.

Perhaps I missed something...but what exactly are you warning us about?

About the fact that sometimes people dont have time to go check out minor
parts to see if they have the part number you want?  I would not have
known which individual piece of the lock mechanism (a .very. general
description that covers from the cylinder to the .latch, and everything in
between) you wanted either.

You purchased a regulator that fit the desciption that was given, (it was
.not. listed as a &quot;NOS 6v 66 bus regulator&quot; was it? did you inquire before
bidding if it was correct?)

Then you purchased a shifter extension, which i presume you were satisfied
with...

and then you offer a vague description of a part (true, with a part
number...but with parts installed on a bus, that cna get rather tedious to
tear into to find which part you want! much better to give a thorough
description of the part in question) and expect immediate results.

then, when you do not get results as fast as you would like (mind you, you
did not state in your original message that you needed an answer
quickly...even unemployeed people have things that occupy their time,
thank you very much. For instance, looking for new employment..) you get
this major attitude, start yelling, and then call people names.

Perhaps we should resubject this thread as &quot;[VB] 'Kabayo' - A WARNING
TO EVERYONE - LONG&quot;


bye..
