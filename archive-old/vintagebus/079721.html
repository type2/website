Subject: 6V starting troubles

I need some help.  (I will try and get to the point)

My VW is still 6V, stock 1200 motor.  It has
intermittent starting trouble that has been going on
for years.
It was totally rewired a few years back (i am 100%
sure it was done right) and I just installed new
battery cables, chassis ground strap and a new
battery.  My ignition switch is also relatively new. 
(locking steering column type if it matters)

What happens is it starts great and then every 4-5
tries it will only &quot;click&quot;.  That is the solenoid
engages but the engine will not turn over.  If i
&quot;bump&quot; the engine (by leaving it in gear and giving it
a little push) it seams to rotate the engine a little
and it will usually start.  I am getting tired of this
though.  (I have not driven it too much because of
this but want to drive it more)

Today i was checking the starter out just to make sure
there was no corrosion. (Starter was replaced in 99) 
It was fine.  While putting the + cable back on i
managed to break off the lug from the solenoid.  Could
a crack in the solenoid here cause this kind of
trouble????  it looks like there is some sort of
contact under this lug but i am not sure.  Have i
found my trouble or is this just a small setback to
finding the real trouble???

Also,  anyone have a 6V solenoid they want to part
with??  New or used.

thanks for the help.

Matt
