Subject: My wiper blades suck

This afternoon we got a preview of the afternoon thunderstorm season here in
Florida.  My wiper blades (which I replaced 2 years ago with stock blades at
$16/each - ouch!!) need to be replaced once again.

When I last replaced them I was not all that happy with the way they worked.
They didnt cover the window that well and the squeege action left something
to be desired.  Mechanically they worked correctly (both speeds) and they
moved back and forth.  I wound up using lots of Rain-X and was careful about
when I headed out.  Because I have to replace the blades, I thought I might
look for a better, non-stock solution.

Any suggestions out there??  This is my daily driver and although everything
is pretty much stock, I am more interested in something that works better
and improves overall safety.

Thanks in advance!!
