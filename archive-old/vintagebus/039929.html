Hi list,

I was near the Keystone state park today, visiting a &quot;junkyard&quot; to get a 
1948 chevy and two splits (yeah there mine, so hands off!!  ;)  ), but 
anyways, the guy (Jim) also has two very nice baywindow campers, (I think 
there nice,), and from what I know, they are pretty complete inside, and 
looks like they were owned by &quot;hippys&quot; if you will.  The one is blue over 
white, with the blue making a &quot;V&quot; down the front, to make it look like a 
split.  It runs and has a title.  The other is white, and looks complete as 
well, with engine and tranny, etc.  does it run?  dont know, looks good.  
The blue one is on a scale of one to ten, an 8 (of restorable or &quot;daily 
driver&quot; campers,) and the other is about a 6.  I definatly think these 
should be bought up, or looked at, but I doubt they will be parted out.  The 
blue one was for $2400 a couple years ago, but is &quot;probably less now&quot;. no 
word on the white one, but a hint at $600 (is what the owner paid for it)

Blue bus = (724)-838-5758
white bus= (724)-668-7939  (ask for Jim)

there is also a pretty beat up older (6 volt) Karmann Ghia, with engine
(e-mail me for directions)
see ya,
Matt in Pa (the &quot;under cover&quot; hippy)

I'm not biteing on these buses, simply cause I'm into splittys more ;)
have fun!
