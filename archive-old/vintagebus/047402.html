&lt;&lt; Dunno if you are aware, but a 59 bus never came with seatbelts, so you
 will have to weld in the mounting points yourself. &gt;&gt;
Hi Steven,
Yes, and no.  The bus did not come with seat belts from the factory until at 
least 1968.  Before this the seat belts were an accessory.  As for the 
threaded plates welded into VWs for instaqlling the seat belts the type 1 got 
these about 1962, and the bus somewhere about 1964.  Seat belts from the VW 
dealerships were availible way before the 1960s and did not require any 
threaded plates welded in.  You only need to drill holes in the proper places 
and use very large thick washers on the underside of the VW to prevent the 
nuts from pulling through the sheet metal.  Interestingly the combo 
shoulder/seat belt was not availible until about 1963 after it made it's 
debue in Volvos.  Previously to this the only seat belts availible were 
either the seat or shoulder belt only.  The seat only crossing your waist 
while the shoulder only went diagonal on you.  Even if you are doing a full 
original resto on your VW we would highly suggest installing the later 
shoulder/lap belts for you and your front seat passenger.   Eric&amp;Barb
