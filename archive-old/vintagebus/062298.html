Subject: RE: [VB] re:tight finned type3 on the samba

Kevin,
The type-3 tight fin oil cooler is not a direct replacement for the Standard
upright doghouse cooler or the type-4 cooler. The oil pressure sender
mounted in the cooler base makes it impossible to install in an upright
doghouse fan housing. Years ago I discovered a plug and seal for the oils
sender hole marketed through CB performance and BOW WOW. I liked using the
T-3 oil coolers when I could get them because they had more fin surface area
for cooling. CB Performance also had an external dual oil cooler mount that
Baja's used mounted in the air flow at the top of the engine compartment on
the outside. The air would flow over the car and through the dual filters.
Great for desert rats. My trike uses dual filters mounted under the axles on
either side of the tranny to catch the airflow under the trike.

	what is the advantage to these over....well a regular doghouse
oilcooler. I
am not sure what was installed on my engine that i got last year-new engine
w/doghouse cooler. I thought either you had a doghouse cooler or you
didn't?(my previous engine did not.
