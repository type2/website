Subject:  RE: [VB] CE Safaris

Hmmmm.....interesting.  The 70mm center to center and 24mm in is correct
by my measurements.  I made 'og' style mounting plates
with these dimensions and og safaris bolted up perfectly...

Kelly Brown (metwiz) would probably have a set of measurements
too?  Metwiz?

Hi Volks,
The screw holes in our set of original safaris frames are 72mm center to 
center, and 10mm centers in from ends.  Each countersunk hole being 7mm in 
diameter.  Measured by former USAF trained level 5 machinist.
