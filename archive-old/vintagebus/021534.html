&lt;&lt; how do i get the inside door handles off of my 59 kombi. as far as i can 
see
 there is no screw like on my 69. the outside ones arnt hooked up and that is
 a major pain so i have to take the doo panel off.
  &gt;&gt;
nope, no screw.
push the door panel towards the outside and look for the pin through the 
handle.   you must find/make a punch that fit the hole.  spray with lube put 
the punch in from the under side (very important) and tap the pin up.   this 
can be very difficult and frustrating depending on the amount of rust 
involved.  Usually use a screw driver or two to prop the little round cover 
away from the panel to aid pin removal.   90% of the time I dont break the 
bakelite cover.

but you dont nee dthe panel off to install/remove the outside handle, as 
their screws go in from the end of the door by where the mechanism hits the 
striker plate.
