Subject: Re: [VB] bias plys?

&gt;   When I
&gt;emailed Firestone about them last year requesting more info, they said
&gt;take them off NOW!!  I suppose they were imagining another F*ord
&gt;Explorer disaster.
...

no, they were concerned the rubber - and more importantly,  the cords 
- had deteriorated due to AGE, and are an EXTREME safety hazard. 
&quot;years of tread left&quot; means nothing when the 25-year-old polyster 
cords fray at highway speeds and the tire literally explodes under 
you.
pennywise, pound foolidh; replace them!!
if you refuse to replace them , stay OFF the highway.  or at least 
let me know what roads you travel, so i can avoid them :P
