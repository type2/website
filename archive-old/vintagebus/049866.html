Subject: Westy Top?
Message-Id: &lt;v03110702b34b0f96e1e3_at_[38.28.68.110]&gt;

I know some of you are going to be mad for me even asking but I was
wondering if anyone here has ever converted a regular roofed bus(splity) to
a pop up early westy square pop top? Is it easly done? what modifications
need to be done? (other then cuting a gaping hole in my roof) and Iam
talking about the pre 68 westy tops not the full length ones... You see I
guess I wouldnt feel so bad cuting up my bus since its already been cut by
sundial camper conversions to put their crank out windows on.

Just curious at this point.. any info would be greatly appereciated!

-Chris.
