Subject: Re: [VB] re:tranny rebuild

I second the Rancho thought. I rebuilt my tranny (freeway flyer) myself 
but purchased the parts from Rancho. They not only sold me the parts 
but they gave me lots of important advise. If I were to buy a rebuilt 
tranny, it would definitely be from Rancho. Their service is way beyond 
what I expected.

&gt; Scott, once I got up to Wisconsin a day early for the bugfest and 
&gt; thought I
&gt; would check out Mofoco's shop not a lot to see out in front of the 
&gt; counter,
&gt; but I do remember someone trying to bring back a rebuilt IRS bus 
&gt; tranny that
&gt; they had bought there and installed to find out it wasn't right, and it
&gt; didn't sound like they were having much luck with the exchange. I 
&gt; think I
&gt; would spend a little extra money on shipping and get one from someone 
&gt; out
&gt; west like Rancho. Doug Lewis
