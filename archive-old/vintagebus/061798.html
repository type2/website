Subject: fuel guage wierdness

I'm trying to figure out what's wrong, if it's the gauge, or sender.
Here's what I got:

65 bus converted to 12v by po
All wiring back to stock as per diagrams
Everything else electrical works fine.
fuel gauge dangling out of dash, I've never seen it work.
engine out, fuel lines clamped

Ignition on, 12v coming in to gauge +

3.5v going out gauge to sender

3.5v at sender, so sender wire is ok.

2 gallons in tank, gauge reads just under 1/4

everything seems fine, but according to the diagram, the gauge body
itself grounds to the chassis.  When I ground it, gauge goes to back
down to nothing.  This is happening on gauge #1 (VDO with light socket
that is working when ground is applied)

gauge #2 looks more like a stock gauge, (it has bugs in it), it gives
the same 12v in 3.5 out readings as the other gauge, but when grounded,
it just barely moves past the &quot;R&quot;.  The light socket is long gone.  When
I remove ground on that one, the needle shoots up to 1/1.

I haven't pulled the sender yet, in hopes the problem was in the wiring,
or one of the gauges.  I guess I'm leaning towards progressing with
gauge #2, since it seems to be working less weird.  Any ideas or
suggestions to try before I go into the gas tank for the sender?
