 stuff can be caught by animals.   And the doggy we had would recognise the
 sound of my 59 when I went to visit my mom- Mom said I had to go say Hi to
 Daisy as the dog would be bouncing in the backyard all excited from hearing
 the bus and knowing I was there.  She even knew that bus as opposed to other
 VWs, as she didn't react the same for other VWs.  Pretty cool, huh?

Bair, my lab-austrain shepard-what ever showed up for the party dog is the
same way.  I average probably 10 to 15 VW's in and out of my house every day,
but when the wife pulls up in her 412 station wagen, Bair goes nuts.  He does
the same thing with my 57' SC and my camper.  Pretty strange but then again
Bair is a strange dog (gets it from me maybe?).  A word of warning to anyone
that visits my place.  If you happen to find several frisbees sitting about
the buses in the back, leave them their.  Bair is quite the frisbee dog and
will run and catch till your arm falls off.
Peace, Love, and now if I could only teach him to read wrench sizes,
