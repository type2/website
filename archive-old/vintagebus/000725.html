&lt;&lt; Hello Everyone
 
    I was on my way to work today and I notice my engine light coming on and
 then it would go off. I checked my oil level and it was full. The Light was
 not constant all the time it flashed off and on when I was driving down the
 freeway any thoughts.
  &gt;&gt;
not good.

but are you sure it is the oil light and not the generator light?  Very very 
very odd for the oil light to flash, unless it is a flicker at idle, which is 
still a sign of low oil pressure, but not so bizarre
