Subject: Bus update.  65 Samba

Well,

I finally found some time to work on the bus this weekend.  It has been
about 3 weeks.  I started blocking out the body in prep for paint.  I
have about half of the bus done with 220 right now.  I will finish off
with 360 and 4 or 500 after that.  Lot's of work here.

I also bought a new paint gun and decided on paint.  I bought a
DeVellblis GTi HVLP gun.  It is a gravity feed unit.  Got a killer deal
on it (as far as all the shops in my area go)  In the process, i found a
supply shop that will sell me supplies at wholesale just like i was a
normal body shop.  too bad i already bought most of my primer months
ago.  they beat my current price my 50%.  Oh well.  I will buy
everything else from them.

As for paint, i am going to use PPG Acrylic Urithane.  CVL type.  It
apears to be good paint.  I could not find enough evidance to make me
switch to Glasso.  I also found a great price on the paint so i will
save some $$ here too.  I hope to be ready to paint the bus in 2 weeks.

Matthew
