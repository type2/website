rimco in santa ana cal can make you a 200 mm flywheel
with 6 volt ring gear in either a o-ring or non o-ring style
(a little hint) you can knock out the o-ring lip on a late flywheel
to fit an early crank

you need to cut your pushrods down to size
on my stock brand new 1600 factory engine
i put 1.25 ratio rockers and just machined the pusrods
to the correct length, by the way i run duel kadrons
on this engine (this engine is going in my new 60 double door)

what a load of sheet metal,  enough to put a load of buses back
on the road, almost sold out, another load after bad camberg

anybody find the windows i need yet????????????????????
