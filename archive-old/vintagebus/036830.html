Damn! Why didn't anyone tell me!??????

Why pay big bucks when you can have Lenny make you one that will be so

close nobody buy Hans Knobel would be able to tell the difference.  They

used the same material as the early Porsches, which he has.  


Last resort yes.
Why am I running used roof panels with big water holes in them?????
I'm suppose I should use the word preservation instead of restoration.


&gt; Pass side front turnsignal housing (Bus, round hole on bottom, pre-57?)


I can't belive these would be hard to find.

Me neither? Whats going on??????


&gt; 2 RASCHE 17mm bolts for spring plate to reduction box.


Why do these have to be RASCHE?  Any good h/w store will have the correct

size metric bolt.

I have two NOS ones that say &quot;KAMAX&quot;. Talk about A.R.!!!!!


&gt; 9-55 dated slotted &quot;smooth&quot; (non crows foot) rims


I've always wondered why people get so AR over the dates on rims.  Has

anyone, ever, ever, ever, in the history of bussing, ever *checked*?  


I was thinking having a stamp made like I did with my hurst bumpers......weld 
up the stamps and restamp my correct date code. (Just Kidding).
If I bump into some mid 50ies dated ones I'll sell off the nice ones I got.


&gt; Pop-out window screws (18)


Wolfsburg west


&gt; Decklid hinge screws (17)


Ditto.

Anyone want to make some cash pulling used ones out of junkers?

&gt; Cab door hinge screws (16)


Triple ditto

&gt; Cargo door hinge screws (8)


I'll see your triple ditto and raise you a ditto.

&gt; Rubber stoppers for flip hatch (Suggestions?)


Single cab gate bumpers


Have any used westy ones to sample off of?

&gt; Rubber seal for flip hatch (Suggestions)


WW sells cargo door seal stuff by the foot.  I used it on my '55

and the profile was *EXTREMELY* close; probably perfect once you

factor in the age of the original.


Awsome, I'll go pick some up.

&gt; Rubber stoppers for rear cabinets (Suggestions?)


SC gate stops.  No, really!

I had a bunch of these, NOS, but now I'm out.


Maybe I'm not as AR as I should be.  I've resigned myself that a 

restoration has be to a compromise, a middle ground between 

doing labor to make the original parts nice, using NOS parts,

or using repro parts.  The tradeoffs are labor and cost.  I could

probably graph it if I was bored.  For instance, I'm happy enough

to have a decent set of 16&quot; wheels; they're not  the &quot;proper&quot;

date code, and the codes don't match each other, but I have 5

and that's good enough for me.  I've 'cut corners' in some areas,

and still have $22k into it to date; I shudder to think what it

would have cost if I'd gone whole hog cadillac like Greg is.

I think I might hit the 22K mark by the time I add up the total figures for 
the westy.
Although 200 hours of rust repair and bodywork take up a large chunk of that!
Maybe I should buy a welder?
Be as AR as you want ot be.
When it comes down to it......people are going to look at my westy and crap 
their pants at what a &quot;poor&quot; restoration is it.
Once they look at painted rubber and brushpainted dash they will flip their 
lid.
Maybe I'll need to educate them that &quot;thats the way westfalia did it in 1955&quot;?
How about the funky three color paint scheme or the brush painted interior 
panels?
Painted screws?
Yellow interior sunvisor?
I think all of you can have a field day pondering over the beast of a 
westfalia camper!
But atleast you wont be able to say my spring plate bolts clash!
