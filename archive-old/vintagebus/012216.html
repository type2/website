&gt;So what is a bus?  A freeway flier made to do 100+ all day long?  I
&gt;believe the original intent was an around town delivery vehicle.  It can
&gt;certainly be made into almost anything (a certain v8 powered version
&gt;comes to mind).  But how in tune are you with the essential busness of
&gt;it all.  Although many have removed them, I feel that putting a hot rod
&gt;engine in a bus with reduction gears in kind of wasting an engine and
&gt;stressing the bus with more power than VW intended it to have.  this
&gt;brings up reliability, maintenance, and 'Where you gonna find an
&gt;unobtanium at 3am in the fine town of Durant Iowa'? issues.

Busness?  Way cool term.  I've spent sooo much money looking for 
a word to express my particular affliction.

IMHO, being bussed is the only way to go.  I haven't been happy
since my bus quit.  I agree that the purist who will only drive
a completely original, concourse bus is a great guy and truly has
a place.  It is usually in the far right lane with the flashers on 
so that the big truck don't kill him and all of his passengers.

But if you want to use the bus in the real world, you need some
push for the boxy one.  As one who has driven his bus to all three
coastlines, Atlantic, Pacific, and Red neck Riveria, it's hard to drive
face on to a head wind that has more horsepower than you do.  There
is nothing wrong with more horsepower with reduction boxes.

And as for parts, 3am ain't going to get you nothing for even a brand new
Lexus.  And all of the vendors will ship overnight.

I say update unless you are totally original.
