I dunno about mesh platinum, but Lenny does incredible work...
The grey vinyl on my '59 panel bench seat is so thick, durable, and feels 
really nice... His stiching is awesome!!!!
Lenny is the man!

If not, I think Ronnie can get you the TMI. When I talked to Wolfsburg West, 
they had a combo of Lenny/TMI---I went straight to Lenny and he made my cover 
and shipped it out in about a week...

Take care,
Pete
