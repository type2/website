Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Brake Conversion

Volk-A-Maniacs,

I have been toying with the idea of a brake kit conversion since getting my 
bus a couple years ago, but I have found the price to be prohibitive.  It 
might end up being one of those 'bite the bullet' kind of things.  They 
always seem to be around $500 when I see ads for them in magazines.  I'd 
like to see them come down 75% from there, but that might just be me being 
cheap.  If you find them good and cheap, let us all know where.

Good luck.
