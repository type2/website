Sounds like you are using a post-71 clutch plate with a 68-70 pressure
plate. They look very similar to the earlier ones, but the post-71 hub is
beefier than the 68-70 hubs, which causes it to foul against the pressure
plate as you discovered. I am sure that if you change to the correct plate
you will marvel at how light and easy your clutch operation becomes.

good luck

&gt;There was steel dust on the input shaft near the pressure plate.  The
&gt;source of it is the ID of the center hole in the pressure plate.  The OD of
&gt;the hub on the clutch disc is grinding away at it, apparently when the
&gt;clutch is pushed in too far.  The contact area is ~1/4 deep.  I wonder if I
&gt;mashed the clutch down too far to cause this.  It doesn't make any rude
&gt;clutch noises and feels ok.
