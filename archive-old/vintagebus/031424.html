&gt; Greg, let me get this straight, you're taking a double door EZ camper and
&gt; turning it back into a panel?  That seems a bit strange, there are plenty
&gt; of DD panels around, but how many EZ double doors?  Are you just pulling
&gt; our legs?  If you're serious, I'll get you a DD in trade for your camper!!
&gt; It would be much less work.
&gt;

No joke!! I'm going to keep it a camper, just get rid of the windows in the doors. I like the idea
of having a usable camper but the look of a Panel. Being a walk thru as well makes it nice camper
wise. I'll post some pictures up with a link if you'd like to see it.
