Subject: early pressure plates vrs. later ones

I am tempted to use the earlier stock pressure plates that use release
levers instead of the diaphragm spring type.  I figured VW stoped
using the more complex pressure plate for the same reason they did
away witht he oil bath air filters.  The better of the two cost too
much.  Is this a wise choice - would anyone know if the earlier type
is the better of the two in terms of performance and reliability?  Who
is the OEM for these pressure plates for VW?

merci
