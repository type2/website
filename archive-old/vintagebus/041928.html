&gt; &lt;&lt; What, didn't the euros get the dual-port engine in '71 as well? &gt;&gt;
&gt; Hi George,
&gt; Pretty sure that was so, but the engine tin had to be a completely differant 
&gt; type to mate it up to later engine compartment.   Eric&amp;Barb

Yes, that would be '72 and up.  I doubt that the '71 euro bus would have
been single port when everything else had gone to dual port.  The tin
should be the same for euro and us buses in '71.
