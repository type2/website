Subject: AridZona Emissions

After some 5+ years working on this bill, it has finally passed, Without the
many dedicated people pushing this  through, it would never happened. My
thanks to all of them.

 

Effective around March 1st 2007, if your vehicle if it is --- 15 years and
older--- NO EMMISSIONS--- You MUST also have Collector car insurance.  Story
on B1 of the Friday AridZona Republic. 

 

So my two 1967 Buses are now able to be driven according to factory specs.
Dual carburetor people you must be very happy. uj
