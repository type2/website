Subject: Re: [VB] shifter problem

the earlier buses didn't come with the plastic bushing, they came with a metal 
tang and a different piece that the stick holder in the cab bolts to.   The 
change was sometime before 61.   probably at when they went to the bent shift 
stick.  I seem to have had the same problem you ran into (or a similar one) when I put a later shift bushing and thing the bushing goes in in my 65 truck, so I took the plastic thing out and found the holder thing with the metal tang.
 
the straight shift stick does not have the pin that holds the stick from rotating.  that was added when they went to the bent shifter.  

 

................-----Original Message-----
The shift rod bushing directly underneath the shifter on my 56 bus was missing 
so I installed one tonight. However, now I am unable to get the bus in to 
reverse. I have the lockout plate with the ridge on the passenger side and the 
slope forward. The bus has a tunnel tranny and has what appears to be a straight 
shifter but I am no early bus expert. Is there a spacer underneath the lockout 
plate? I spent lots of time trying to get it to go but it won't. All other gears 
will engage. Also, the early shifters have aren't peened right?
