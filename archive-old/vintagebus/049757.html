Subject: Re: [VB] 6 v -&gt; 12 v

&gt;Thanks for all the answers. I think I just put in a 12 v generator in my
&gt;bus.
&gt;
&gt;This would be my setup :
&gt;12 v Generator
&gt;2 * 6 v Batteries (in seriel connection)
&gt;I will keep my 6 v starter and I will give it 12 v to start on.
&gt;
&gt;So which 12 v generator will fit into my 1500 (42 Hp) engine (engine number
&gt;H 1029746) ?


You can get a Porsche 356 generator to fit your existing generator stand
(expensive), or change to a 12v generator stand and use a type 1/2
generator, or change to an alternator stand and use a 12v generator or
alternator.  Your bus may already have the 12v size (105mm?) generator
stand, as many 1500 buses had the large size 6v generator.  The large
6v/12v generator is about the same diameter as the generator pulley.  The
standard 6v/Porshe 12v generator is noticably smaller than the pulley.
