Subject: Re: [VB] Ever get your bus stuck?

Nice story Mike!

My brother and I took my 67 kombi to Baja 2 years ago.  One day when the
surf was small, we went driving.  I drove through the tiniest little dip
and got stuck.  I tried the e brake trick and it moved more, but no
luck.   We spent 45 minutes pushing back and forth by hand, pushing
branches under the tires.

Now, let me tell you how easy it was to find branches 200 miles south of
the border. . . .

&gt; Tonight when I was leaving work I decided to drive
&gt; through this mud puddle that is always in front of
&gt; where I park my bus. I park on a incline that faces an
&gt; area that is going to be a &quot;park&quot; for the complex. I
&gt; always leave and kinda get my wheels in the dirt, but
&gt; tonight I wanted to get her feet wet. The intent was
&gt; to go down the incline enter the dirt/mud and when I
&gt; hit the water hang a left and leave. Well I went down,
&gt; hit the dirt turned left and got stuck in the
&gt; mud/water.
&gt; 
&gt; Man that stuff was plenty deep!! I started thinking
&gt; about how much it is gonna cost to have the tow truck
&gt; to come and rescue me, then I start thinking about me
&gt; laying in the mud and hooking up the tow line. Then I
&gt; got out and took a look, I could hop to dry land from
&gt; the drivers door. The bus was surrounded by water
&gt; hubcap high. I said I ain't gonna give up without a
&gt; fight, IT IS a bus. So as soon as I go to get back in,
&gt; a guy in a Pacific Bell van pulls up and offers some
&gt; help, sure was nice but I was more than embarrassed.
&gt; He had some rope and while he was un-tangling his mess
&gt; I kept rocking the bus back and forth, throwing mud
&gt; and water the whole time. Well I am here to tell you
&gt; tonight that I got that 'Ol kombi out of that rut. And
&gt; my only two regrets are that I didn't have my camera
&gt; with me, and that everyone at work was watching me!!
