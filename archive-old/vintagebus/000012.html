Hi Dworkin,
You are welcome.  Our 1966 Technical data booklet &quot;Without Guesswork&quot; shows 
it as 40/4.0 DIN, and 50/4.6 SAE in the 7.3:1 CR model.  Or 40/4.0 DIN, and 
47/4.6 in the 6.6:1 CR model.  Most of these increases over the old 40HP is 
due to the bigger intake manifold allowing more air/fuel mixture in.
