&gt; That's lame, you can't count replacement of the same components,
&gt; otherwise, I've spent like $5k on tune-ups over the years.  I could say
&gt; my Notchback has about $30 or $40k invested, too, since I have all the

&gt; Nothing against you, Stephen, just a general comment.  :)

I agree completely,

I was just saying how he might have come up with the figure.  But
personally i see no relation between what you laid out for something, and
what its worth on an open market.  Some people make money, smoe loose it
hand over fist (me me me, hehe) and some just about break even.

What determines what something is worth is its current condition and how
closely that mirrors what you are looking for/what the market will bear.

peas,

Steve
