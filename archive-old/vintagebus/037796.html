Yeah, I saw that too, interesting.  I was actually wondering if the body work was custom too, along with the paint.

&quot;Tranny good minus 4th gear&quot;, that is damn funny.

the thom sez:

&gt; gear-xtra 40 horse orig. motor &amp; tranny incl.
&gt; *Very nice bus-needs only interior work &amp; a good home-must sell do to lack of
