&lt;&lt; I have been waiting for 2 months now for Das Bulli to ship the cargo floors
 for my brother's 66 Westy.  We are quite annoyed.  All attempts to contact
 this buisness are in vain.  Any ideas out there? &gt;&gt;

I dont know. Did you piss them off? I put my order in last Sunday night, put
the money in the mail on Monday and got my order today. Although my order was
a lot smaller than cargo floors. Maybe they don't have them in stock??
