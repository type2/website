&lt;&lt; nd i leave the cab section for last cause it will be the hardset to do,if 
 your saving the skin or dash.
 happy sawzalling. &gt;&gt;
If I try to save the nose I like to cut it off first as the windshield post 
will hold it up while you cut the floor out, otherwise roof first. I also try 
to position the vehicle very close to the living quarters of any neighbors 
who have kept me up recently before I get out the sawzall.
