Yeah, well Thom, don't get us started on THAT! heheh just kidding of course.

You make some great points. And for the record, it's not that I'm
anti-custom, it's just not my bag, baby. Do what you want to your bus, but
hold or sell me the parts you don't want! And, don't expect me to &quot;ohh&quot; and
&quot;ahh&quot; over how low it is, or how high it is or whatever. I like stock
buses. My 66 EZ Camper is a daily driver, so I have a freeway flier and 12
volt and all that stuff...and when I repainted it 8 years ago I thought two
tone looked nice (it did, but it's time for new paint and I'm going single
tone).

Also, like Thom said, you shouldn't be expecting to get all of your money
out of your bus. My EZ Camper is a nice decent bus, but...I can't imagine
how much I've put into it over the past 11-12 years I've driven it
everyday. But, if things got tough and I had to sell it, I wouldn't be
asking anything near the fix or six digits I've put into it.

Ok..that's enough for me. Let's all play nice now.
