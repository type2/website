Subject: cargo floors

hey, who's got an old bus to cut up? ...or thats been cut up already
preferrably... why cut up a good bus?
anyways...
I need cargo floors.  I cut out a lot of mine today..
no more inner or outer rocker on der 63, and the cargo floor is cut out
to about a foot in.  The crossemembers cleaned up nicely though!  I also
cut out about 10&quot; back from the bulkhead. the width of the bus.  And I
will be cutting out the inner and outer rockers on the drivers side
soon....er..cutting out whats left.  If anyone has any large cargo floor
sections... PLEASE email me!  I need em.  I don't feel like dropping
$150 on cargo floors.  Especially when I won't even be using the seat
latches.. but if they're on there..bonus I guess.
I want good cargo floor...no holes
thanks!!
the following is also needed...email if you have any.
all for a 63

new rubber... EVERYTHING
wiring harness
2 inner rockers
2 outer rockers
cargo floor parts

thanks again!
