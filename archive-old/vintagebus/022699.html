Another listmember and I were discussing offline some of the details of the
bus.  There are several things that are incorrect, which would be very
simple to correct.  But the paint and interior *rock*.

On mine, I probably will not go the the extremes on the underbelly,
preferring instead to go with the simpler (and cheaper) grey.

I think I recall the guy paid ~$13k for point A.

So, it costs $30k to go from point A to B.  I have over $20k into my '54,
and I'm not even to point A. :(  

So that would be (hyperventilating) $50k into the bus.  Wow.  Then again,
you're not going to find another one like it at one of the shows :)

&gt;day just so I could take a peek.  They are very nice.
