It's been guessed by p-mail (Erin Lassley) and on the list (Chuck Notmeyer),
so now we can reveal what part can be removed from a 1950 Barndoor Deluxe
walk-through and installed on a 1998 Corvette...... Valve Stems... otherwise
known as Schrader valves. Strangely enough, they can be installed on a 1965
Schwinn bicycle, but not on my 1990 Raleigh Technium road bike. The skinny
tired racing bikes use a Presta valve. No spring and an external screw to
positively lock the 120 lbs. of air in.

 -Harry in sunny but cold Fresno

-63 DC
-65 Deluxe
-74 Gas Thing (for sale soon)
-74 Electric Thing (for commutating)
-90 Raleigh
-85 Cannondale
-6? Paramount Tandem
