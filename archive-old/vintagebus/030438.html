Subject: BRRRRRR!!!

 The weather here in Nebraska is starting to get to me.  Another 6&quot; of
snow overnite on top of an inch of sleet and freezing rain yesterday
just about has me climbing the walls. We have already exceeded our
normal average snowfall for the entire winter. I had to put the Westy
away around Thanksgiving and although I have visited it several times I
have not been able to drive it. I haven't even been able to install the
new taillights I picked up from Ronnie last month.(OBC)Last year our
winter weather was so warm that I would have been able to drive it if
the bodywork had been completed. I know that we don't have the worst
weather on earth right now but I really miss driving Frodo around. I
know that we are only talking a couple of more weeks but as much as I
would hate to deal with the desert heat during the summer I would sure
like to be a bit warmer and dryer in the winter. Hell we'll need a
couple of good Nebraska gullywashers to clean the TONS of salt they put
down this year.
