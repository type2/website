&lt;&lt; BUT....... where can I, if anywhere, can I get a new solenoid without 
another starter attached to it?  It's a 12v starter in my '65 Microbus with a 
1600 dp.  &gt;&gt;
Hi Jim,
First check the amount of voltage getting to the solinoid!  We had the same 
problem and it turned out mostly to be the original ignition switch, and the 
rest bad dirty connections from the battery on through the wiring to the 
front.  Using those darn solinoid relays without first checking/cleaning 
things just ends up curing only one symptom and lets the rest of the 
electrical system run dim lights and slooooow wipers, signals.    Eric&amp;Barb
