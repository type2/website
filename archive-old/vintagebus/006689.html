so that should be even more reason to drive it

--
I did the *12 hour* trip from Phoenix to the OCTO last
year in the 36hp barndoor. I could not bring myself to
haul a 5 month baby and nursing wife with me in a 46
year old bus, stopping to feed every two hours for an
hour each time. Add that to last year's 12 hours and I
would have to start out today to get there in time.
&lt;not!&gt;  This year I will blast over in about 5 hours
and &quot;allow&quot; Momma and daughter to stay at home.
