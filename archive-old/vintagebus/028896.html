Subject: re: [VB] Questions for dizzy gurus 

After examining both of these dizzies, I've determined that the zv/jcu 4
r 3 has a leaky diaphragm, but the 0 231 129 019 seems to be ok (except
for the locked-down shaft, which I will fix).

The 019 is equivalent to a 009 (sez Jim A.). I wanted to keep my engine
compartment as clean as possible (no vac lines, if possible), so I guess
this is my new dizzy...

I don't see an adjustment for the spring tension on the weights. I've
been told that an 010 has this adjustment (boss won't let me have that
one!).

WetWesties website shows different numbers for the cap and rotor (03
010, 03 019 for the cap; 04 033, 04 008 for the rotor). Can anyone pin
this down, or does it matter?
