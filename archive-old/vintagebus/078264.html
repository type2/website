Curt,

You're gonna have more trouble with the 90W tranny oil. I've been in that
situation many times. Not for a long time, since I switched to Mobil One,
but it's your tranny oil that is hard as a rock right now.

Start the bus with your clutch pressed down to the floor, and only release
it very slowly, checking how the engine speed is being affected, until
you've lifted the pedal all the way. Let the whole thing warm up for
atleast 20 minutes. Heat your garage the night before if you can.
Everything will help.

&gt; So, I know that fresh 30 weight oil I put in her in late Nov. is going
&gt; to be rock solid.  Question is, what do I do to soften up the oil before
&gt; I crank Her over?  I have a 1 1/2 quart extra cooler sump and an oil
&gt; filter on Her too, remember, She's a beefed up 1835 with a progressive,
&gt; balanced with a mild cam (100 degrees)
