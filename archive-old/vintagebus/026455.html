You remember correctly.  I saw them also.

If remember correctly, there were 2 sets of truck ribbed bumpers for $700/set at the last Pomona.  I believe they were still there when I left.  Front bumper is the same, of course.  Both were decent but not &quot;paint and bolt up to your show truck&quot; quality.
