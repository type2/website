Subject: Re: [VB] under pedal spash pans - how many kinds?

  One of the subtile differences is the flange on the edge. Real early are spot welded on, later are part of the metal.
If I ever get my camera back from being repaired I will take pics. I think (when my brain is working) that 
dropgates_dot_com has pics of all of them

&gt;i thought there were only two as well. I looked at the parts heap and the
&gt;buses, and i only have the two listed as 50's and 60's in that ad. (the
&gt;furthest right on the bottom)being from a 67 parts bus, the rest being like
&gt;the one in the middle(back to my 57).
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; I was looking at the samba and saw this ad... it has pictures of 3
&gt;versions
&gt;&gt; of the 3/55-67 pedal pan.  I thought there were two versions.     Anyway,
&gt;the
&gt;&gt; pics are nice and clear showing the differences, so anyone who cares about
&gt;this
&gt;&gt; trivia take a look.
