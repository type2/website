Regarding Jim Ellis's post about the car top tents, I just got this e-mail from a factory rep.  I guess they are made to order and currently they are having a sale.  FWIW they are pretty pricey, but nice though.  

Here is the web site if you hadn’t seen it.

&gt;Dear Steve,
    I just received your request for more information and want to let you know about a special sale we are having.  It is our first ever sale.  We call it the &quot;2 Day - Fill the Factory Sale&quot; because Dec 4th and 5th we will be 
accepting orders on all our tents.  Here is the deal, we are offering special prices $200 - $400 lower than standard prices.  I just returned from the factory in Europe and they have expanded and will have extra capacity this winter. The catch is that these are tents that are made for you.  The whole factory is just in time so there is no inventory.  We ask for a $250 refundable deposit and will include your order with our order for the spring. 

You will receive a delivery date when we expect them to come in.  We ask for the balance when we ship your tent.  You will have your tent ready in plenty of time for spring.

Here are the prices

Maggiolina
Small Adventure  $1155.00
Large Adventure  $1435.00
Small On Line  $1115.00
Medium On Line  $1295.00

Columbus
Small  $995.00
Medium  $1085.00

Overcamp
Small  $750.00
Medium  $875.00

Shipping will run from $75-$100 to West Coast $100-125 Midwest and $125-$150 to the East Coast.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Best regards,
Rich Haslacher
Lofty Shelters
