Subject: Re: [VB] re:accelerator push rod hole

the hole for the accelerator rod on my 65 westy is about 1 1/8&quot; diameter.  
not very axactly, but about.
Doesn't look like it's ever been altered.

 I understand that, however my hole is so small I can only get the very top of
 the seal in. If I push it in to the position it is supposed to be in, it does
 not seal at all as it is folded.  Therefore I think that the hole has been 
cut
 too small.
