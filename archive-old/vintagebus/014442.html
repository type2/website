&lt;&lt; Is there a quick way to determine when the steering box is centered in its

centered??  &gt;&gt;
Hi Steve,
First get under your bus, and put the pit man arm back to where is was.  Next 
set your toe in, and then center the steering box, and front suspension to 
each other by shortening/lengthening the drag link.  To remove the pitman arm 
to straighten things out you run the risk of having the pitman arm, and the 
drag link end up parallel to each other.  which will cause the steering to 
either get hard in tight corners especially at higher speeds or even lock up 
the steering!   Eric&amp;Barb
