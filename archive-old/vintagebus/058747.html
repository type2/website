... nah its not that bad.  I can reach behind the tin to get to it.  Its a
bit of a PITA, but I figured the inconvenience was worth the added safety.

Hi Rich,
Does your fuel filter placement require you to remove a lot of tin, or even
drop the engine, in order to change the fuel filter?  How accessible is it
in it's new location?

Thanks,
Ed

&gt; it was said ....
&gt;  Most people jam plastic fuel filters in the line between the pump and
&gt; carburetor
&gt;
&gt; When I rebuilt my engine a little over 2 years ago (my oh my, how time
&gt; flies) I put the fuel filter behind the tin, about 10 inches from the
tank.
&gt;
&gt; The guy at the FLAPs suggested it and it seemed to make sense to have
fewer
&gt; points of potential fuel line failure where the engine is hottest.
Although
&gt; I have no point of reference (my first-ever VW), things appear to run just
&gt; fine.
&gt;
&gt; All this talk reminded me that its time to replace the lines (I promised
&gt; myself I would do this every two years).
