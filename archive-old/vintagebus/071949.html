Subject: bus advice

So I used to have a 54 bug. I was only 18, and couldn't keep it. Despite 
putting a lot of money and time into getting parts, I traded it for a bus 
(which I really wanted anyway). I have had a '58 standard and am now 21 and 
kind of have the same problem. I spent about $1000 to get new brakes, clutch, 
and motor completely gone over (not rebuilt) so I could drive it home. But it 
has no title and needs new wiring. I have rear lenses and housings that work 
when I run wires to test them with the light switch and brakes. But it has no 
horn, headlights, or turnsignal switch. I now have the dilemma of putting 
money into my '62 comet, which runs but burns a lot of oil (needs new 
rings/rebuild). Starting to work on my bus again, or selling it to better 
restore my comet which is my daily driver. I live in the Los Angeles area and 
was looking for advice. I don't know what it takes to get a title, or if I 
would need to buy a turnsignal switch, or what it might cost to have an 
electrician run new wires just to get it all wired up and sound. I know that 
if I had a lot more time, which I don't have, I could do it without spending 
a lot of money. Or I could have it done in little time, but for a LOT of 
money. Anybody on the list could take my bus and have it on the road in less 
than a week, but I would love to drive it (legally) someday. 
Can anybody tell me what they think it might cost at an electricians to run 
new wiring, and what it takes to get a title. I'm sure I must have to provide 
more info about the condition of it, so please email me any questions and 
suggestions. This is why I love this list. THANKS FOR ANY HELP. and I will 
try to get some pics up within the next week.
