Just a friendly reminder,,, if you paint brake drums.... or Rims... scrape
the paint off where the Rim meets the drum,, around the lug and the rim
hole,,,
When paint gets hot from braking,,, it softens,, and melts and the wheel
nuts get LOOSE!
I never liked chasing  a stray wheel down the Highway!

&gt;The reason for painting the brake drums is that I hate the look of a
&gt;rusty drum - it looks tacky and unfinished.  I hate painting them with
&gt;regular paint because it doesn't withstand the road abrasion
