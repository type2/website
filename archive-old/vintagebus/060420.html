Subject: Coat hook Q.

Would a 66 DLX 13 window have the round plastic coat hooks, or the
chrome moving clip style? Mine has four holes, and a fifth near the
driver, but no hooks, bought the chrome style and they fit over the
areas with four holes on each side, but I am unsure of which is correct,
and am confused about the single hole near the driver.
