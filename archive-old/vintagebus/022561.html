Pulled the engine on our '65 Westy yesterday, too hot here in CT, and that
bolt over the starter did not cooperate....we are installing a brand new
engine for our trip to Newfoundland, and with the engine out, I found that
the heat exchangers are shot. I think this bus will be with us for along
while, so who has the best heat exchangers? Any opinions?

Also, the seal in the transaxel is bad, are there different ones for
different years? What should I be looking for? The catalogs seem to list
one size fits all. thanks again, Jim
