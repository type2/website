&gt; &quot;It was not the time to find out that the hand-brake needed adjusting and

&gt; it was, bumper to bumper traffic, no way to bail out, no place to bail out
&gt; to. Before I got to the top of the hill, you could smell the clutch. By the
&gt; time I got to the top, you would swear from the smell, that flames were
&gt; roaring out the back of the DC.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; Let me guess... 009 dizzy.

NO, stock vacuum dizzy

&gt; &gt;From this description I can only assume that you were &quot;holding&quot; the bus in
&gt; place on the hill with the clutch and gas.  This is a sure fire way not to
&gt; have a clutch last very long.  Try &quot;heal and toe&quot; driving with your left
&gt; foot partially on the gas and brake for hills.  Also practice on deserted
&gt; hills, there is no reason you should not be able to use the brakes regularly
&gt; on and no clutch, you just need to be familiar with your bus.

I did the heal-toe thing with my RIGHT foot.
Starting on a the middle of a hill and then proceeding in a continuous manner to
the top is one thing .

Try starting at the bottom of the hill, and move two feet, stop, move two feet
stop, move two feet stop until you reach the top.  Total time for this trip was
about 30 minutes. (no lie!)  If I stopped for any length of time to allow a gap
to develop, I got crazed drivers all the way down the hill honking at me.

As far as practicing for a run like this on a deserted hill, I doubt anybody has
the perseverance to do this for the 30 minutes that we endured.

&gt; I agree that if you just &quot;glazed&quot; the clutch it will come back to proper
&gt; usage after some miles.

It has returned to normal operation.
