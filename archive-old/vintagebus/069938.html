&gt; When fitting the bushes that are like shuttle cocks, should I fit only the 
&gt; rear bush, insert the rod into the tube and slide it far enough forward to 
&gt; fit the front bush from the front, or should I fit both and squash the 
&gt; front bush by hand so that it goes into the shift rod tube?

Hi Paul,
Whichever works is fine.  We were able to install all from the rear.

&gt; Is it okay to just grease the rod and the bushes and fit it, or should I put 
&gt; something else into the tube to prevent rust and keep shifting slick?

Grease definitely.  Better if you can add graphite to the grease.  Graphite 
will lubricate the parts long after the grease turns dry.
