&lt;&lt; Man, I really don't want this to sound insulting... as I'm sure you must
 have thought of it, but it needs to be said :)
 
 Why not just get a 1971 bus?  The ball joint front ends is a lot nicer ride,
 poptops are a lot nicer, you can get poptop canvas that is 2x as big for 1/2
 the price, etc, brakes are awesome, etc, etc. &gt;&gt;
    It is somethig I am considering, It isn't just the window though its the 
whole deal.  It should be noted that I'm putting a dormobile top in a split 
(if I do it) not a later westy top. If I could find an affordable close to 
useable 71 dormobile I would buy it. As for using vs. collecting I will use 
every bus I ever own. No point in having it if you dont. I know this seems 
silly but I owned a bay in the past and just didn't have the love for it. It 
made it harder to do all those little tasks you love to hate. 
This is all still in the planning stages I have no set ideas about what I'm 
going to do yet. As always, any advice, stories or rants are appreciated.

Ronnie
