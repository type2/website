Subject: $500 buses... 

Hi all,
  I am one who doesn't have a lot of disposable income
when it comes to my addiction.  My first bus, a 1965
Westy was the highest paid... a whopping $1800.  Sure
it was in real nice shape and ran, but it had a horrid
engine swap that turned around to bite me in the
fanny.  It was a 1600cc out of a super beetle and was
nothing but trouble.  My second bus, 1970 Westy, was
gleaned for $700!  It ran great and I still have the
engine and interior, but the body was shot.  My 68
Westy is a $400 bus and I am picking up a 75 for $400
also.  While the 68 got the engine out of the 70, the
75 runs.  I am spending more on a 71 that looks real
nice... only a grand, and my 85 Vanagon was just a
shade under grand too.  I hate to pay too much for a
car and get a headache... I will stick to ones I can
get cheap and pass by the $2k and up ones for now.
  Wavin from Michigan.
-Dawn
