Hi Cal,
This problem would be vastly reduced if a zinc primer coat of powder coating 
is applied first.  Which was designed for marine (Salt Enviroment) exposure, 
and protects the steel due to the zinc sacrificing itself before the steel 
will rust and plus since the zinc corrodes so slowly the area even if 
scratched or cracked takes a looooong time for the steel to show any rust.  
We noticed using the primer first also reduced the problem of the 
powdercoating color coat not getting into the cracks on the type 2 rims where 
the inner part meets the outer part of the rim due to the &quot;Corralis&quot; (SP?) 
effect.
