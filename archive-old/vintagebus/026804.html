&gt; I saw on the type2 list that there is a nice 71 front beam for sale in
&gt; Amarillo, TX (an area I travel to regularly).  Can this beam be swapped into
&gt; my 58 single cab?  I checked the resource library and it sounds like it is a
&gt; bolt-in for later splitties, but I wanted to check the collective opinion of
&gt; the list on such swap.
&gt;
&gt; Obvious advantages:  Disc brakes (those of you that have ridden with me KNOW
&gt; I need any braking improvements I can get!!) and a smoother/cushier ride (is
&gt; my 58 the only one that feels like a Ford F-350 with offroad suspension?).
&gt;
&gt; Questions:  Is this a bolt-on swap?  Which of the 58 and which of the 71
&gt; steering pieces get used?  Will I need a different master cylinder and/or
&gt; some sort of brake fluid pressure regulator?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for any and all help!!

Hey Mike!
I'm sure others may correct me, but the '68 &amp; '69 are the bolt on beams to the
splits.  I'm in the process of doing this and have the beam (with '78 discs),
all rebuilt and just waiting for me to pull the old off and the new on.  I'm
putting on the servo &amp; mc from the '78 and I have purchased a new mc from bus
depot.  What is holding me back at this point is that I have to get a 5&quot; x 5&quot;
metal plate to weld to the beam to mount the brake servo.

Also, the newer beams make the splits ride about 3&quot; higher.  Now if you're
making a baja bus, no problem.  I bought a set of albatross adjusters from bus
boys and welded them onto the beam.  That was the hardest part of the project.

- beam is from a '69
- swing arms from a '78
- spindles, calipers, etc. are from a '78
- servo &amp; mc from a '78
- all wearable parts replaced/rebuilt.

remember that if you put the discs on the front, you will have different wheel
bolt patterns on the front and rear.  Two spares?

Since I have the '78 bolt pattern on the rear for the type IV motor, this is my
steps to get the better braking you describe and match wheel patterns all
around.

Anyway, it sits in my patio all cleaned, rebuilt and painted just waiting for
the final mods and bolt up time.  Looks like I won't get a chance to do this now
until spring break! grrrr grumble....
