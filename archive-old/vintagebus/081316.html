Subject: Surface Removal

I need some help.  I am trying to sand down must Rusty singlecab, so can put
it in primer.
I got a 10,000 rpm air hand sander and put on 60 grit sandpaper.  This is
taking forever!  What is the right way to get it down to metal?  What I'm
doing isn't working that well.  I need something cheap and effective!

Thanks for the help
