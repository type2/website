Subject: fuel filter ?

my fuel filter is loooking a little foggy, and i don't think i have changed 
it before. is it a pretty straight forward thing-like taking the existing 
one off-and just replacing itwith a new one? how do you plug the tube up so 
you don't get gas every where? if anyone has any advice i would love 
it-otherwise i'll just dive in and see what happens.
thanks
