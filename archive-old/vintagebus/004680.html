sheet metal is finally leaving england this week (promised by alan)
have complete front floors (custom made for me) thats the cause of delay
complete cargo floors, dog legs (late)
rear wheel arches (early and late model)
repair pieces etc.
if anybody wants possibly could add complete windshield repair parts ($)
anything special please   call as shipment is leaving (your stuff also thom)

was watching the sci fi channel (computer nerd show) when it ended this
weird ad came on for jdhfgdhsjs  jksjdhfdj 3000 (forgot the name)
in it was a cartoon 21/23 window flying through space with the evil women in
it
then a side view it looked like a combi, had rocket engines on side
then an interior view, showed a real bus with the evil women steering wheel
moving and all, even had a radio (not one of mine) cool though, will try to
find
tv guide to find out real name of show, all this was in the opening of the
show

the 60 double door that was part of the major bus rescue is in primer ready
for
final blocking a little more body tuning then paint, should have done
(exterior)
to be at the classic, metal work done, replaced front drivers floor (with
original
piece out of 1 of bus rescue buses), left rear partial rocker, right cargo
rocker
and right rear quarter piece, went real smooth, by the way just to double
check
i tried another suppliers rocker then alans (the stuff i import) rocker to
check fit
alans went right in with no mods looks awesome, door lines blend etc, should
have
taken pictures so everyone could see the difference, i will when i do the 66
westy.
time put into body work so far approx. 55 hours will spend another 20
blocking for
paint, mind you this is not a show bus but would just like to have a
freshley painted one
again.  PS the 62 swap panel will be for sale soon also have a couple cheapy
fixers
f/s need to clear some out
