We are all camping at the White Spar campground, Havasu, Phoenix,Alaska and
who knows who else! The campground is just south of town, you can find it on
the internet. It's an honor pay system I have been told and you can see it
from the road. Look for the limo bus.

ps. Leaving by noon today, so I won't be around this weekend.

Greeting on and all:

Does anybody know where the bus caravan from Havasu will be staying/camping
Saturday before the &quot;Rally Tour&quot; starting at 3:00pm? It is my understanding
that Sunday will be the only Swap Meet day, not Saturday.

Thanks,

Hart
