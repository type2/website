Subject: stock exhaust

Hi all,
I have finally removed the fugly loud extractor exhaust (came with the
bus) and tomorrow I am going to put a proper bus exhaust on. What is
this going to do to my fuel/air mixture? I have a feeling it is going
to make it richer, but I'm tired and cold and really can't quite
figure it out... Will I be rejetting my carb at the rest stops on the
way to BBB?
Thanks,
Joel and the tentless '64 Sundial
