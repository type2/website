Les,

Gene Berg sells the special mounts needed to do this conversion. 
Obviously, you need to go IRS, but you also have to 'dent' the frame
horns to clear the cv joints.

If I remember correctly (I was going to do this at one point), the type
4 cv joints allow you to run very close to stock height.

&gt; I have been following Scott Frasers posts with great interest. Who
&gt; wouldn't love the power of the type four engine for long trips?
&gt; 
&gt; When this subject first appeared, I visited Joe Cali's site as well as
&gt; others. Believing that the type 4 conversion was too good to be true, I
&gt; emailed Bob Hoover for his take on the subject. He stated that the type2
&gt; tranny wasn't set up to handle the torque and that, at the very least, a
&gt; rear engine crossmember would have to be added to handle the weight and
&gt; to help manage the torque. Now that Scott is experiencing tranny
&gt; problems, it would apppear the Bob was right (once again :)).
&gt; 
&gt; Now for my question. Will the type four tranny fit into a splitty?? And,
&gt; if so, just how much of a hack job would need to be done to do so??
