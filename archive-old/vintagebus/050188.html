&gt;&gt; Just my opinion, that and $3799.98 could have you the '70 Beetle I missed
&gt;&gt; out on...
&gt;
&gt;Where in the 4th dimension are 1970's beetles going for that ?!!! If you're
&gt;willing to pay that for a 70 bug, all I have to say to you is ....&quot;RECYCLER&quot;!
&gt;You'll make someone in there ecstatic.


Take a look and then snicker:

My bid was $3555.55, but it didn't show that because I didn't meet the
reserve.  During the auction, seller said his reserve was &quot;just over
$4000&quot;.  I emailed seller within 5 minutes of the close of the auction to
inquire his asking price, and ask if he was going to re-list.  He didn't
answer me for two days, and then wrote that he sold the car shortly after
the auction for $3800.

I was searching for bugs in various places a few days later and found an ad
for the same car which predated the auction.  The asking price was $5900.
The seller was a used car dealer.  Just goes to show you how much lower the
REAL price can be at those used car lots, compared to their crazy asking
prices.

My heart is still broken.
