Subject: Re: [VB] Grand Canyon

When we went to the Grand Canyon there were all these parking lots that were
full of cars and no place to park.
BUT there were these parking lots right up front that said 'Bus Parking
Only'
Boy were we glad that we just got a warning tickets

&gt; As a (all but the first nine months)native Arizonan, I can say that the
Grand
&gt; Canyon has at least three views. South Rim, North Rim, and the Collin
Fletcher-
&gt; down in- looking up view. All three are unique and regulated. South is
most
&gt; visted and accessible. North is nicer, in my opinon, for summer camping.
Hiking
&gt; down inside the canyon is a complete trip all unto its self. Save the
North for
&gt; Summer, the South for long car trips with Grandma wherein you drive
forever,
&gt; arrive and expect someone to say something such as &quot;that's one big AZ
hole!&quot;
&gt; Then you hop back into the '66 Electra and cruise home to Phx/Tucson.
&gt; Check for reservations and regulations. Yes, North rim is usually closed
for
&gt; the brunt of the Winter months.
