I purchased a set of the WW repro coco mats. They have the
look and feel like the original stuffing. I think the trick
is to cover the mats with upholstry felt. That is how my
original seats are built up.

&gt;
&gt; Have any of you ever used the Wolfsburg West repro &quot;horse
hair&quot;
&gt; seat pads?  I bought a set, and am not sure they're all
that
&gt; great.  They're hard as hell, and only surpassed in
butt-bruising
&gt; discomfort by sitting on the bare seat pedestal.  Doe they
loosen
&gt; up over time? (doubtful)  Is there some magic I was
supposed to
&gt; do to them before installation?  I did multiple layers of
various
&gt; foam densities (a local oldtimer taught me some upholstery
tricks)
&gt; on the '55, and those seats are quite comfy.
