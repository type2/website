Everett,

Dave Roberts has a 7-door panel (58 as I recall) that I did the body/paint on
some time ago.  The bus is a delivery vehicle for the 'Four Peaks Brewery'.
It has a divider in it.  He might even have another one.  When he first
started talking to me about doing the bus he had another, or two, and I think
there was another divider in one of them.  It's been a while, but it might be
worth checking out.

Four Peaks is at 1340 E. 8th Street in Tempe (in case you haven't been there).
303-9967.  Excellent &quot;OATMEAL STOUT&quot;!!!, BTW.
