Subject: Front Brake Spring Hardware for 1959

Hello List,

Does anyone know where I can buy the front drum springs for a 1959 split?  I 
need them ASAP as I plan to be going to a show this weekend.  The PO had the 
wrong springs in the front passenger side wheel and they both broke.  Now I 
want to replace them with what is correct.  I have looked at some suppliers 
online and no one seems to have this hardware for this year.  Only 1961 and 
later.

Your help is greatly appreciated.
Thanks
Mike
