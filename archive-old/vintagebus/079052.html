Subject: [VB] new panel, loud rgbs.

 it's been sitting for several hours now and they are still full to the rim,
 so i think i did get more gear oil. but having calmed down a bit, it occurs
 to me that it could be because it's on stands so the boxes are lower. doh!

 think i am going to drain and refill the boxes, for peace of mind, and to
 see if any chunks come out.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; When you spun the stubs oil did not fill the box, it just clings to the
&gt; &gt; gears. Fill the boxes and trans and see what it does. I had a noisy
trans
&gt; on
&gt; &gt; a new to me single, once filled it was a lot less noisey.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I fill the boxes first then the center section. give the boxes time to
&gt; &gt; settle too.
