Subject: tire pressure


we REALLY need to figure this one out... this is a big-time safety
issue!! i recently purchased some bridgestone 603v tires for the 70,
load rating
1750 per tire, pressure 65 psi.
i have been told by a few folk that the vw spec for radials is correct,
by 2 or 3 others that the tire factory pressure is correct, and MUST be
adhered to to prevent tire damage and/or wear.
the people who say to run lower pressure point to the lower weight of
the bus vs. suvs (the high weight of suvs is usually close to the rating
of the tire), and that tread wear might be affected. those who swear by
the factory rating affirm that running a heavily loaded tire when
underinflated will strain it and cause tread seperation... our busses
might not roll, but a blowout is no fun nonetheless.

all the &quot;i'm doing this&quot; and &quot;vw said that&quot; is useless - what it will
take is someone out there who talks to the tire manufacturers on a
regular basis what THEY would recommend... if bridgestone tells me to
run the 603v at 60 psi with a bus weight of say 5400 lbs, THAT IS THE
PSI TO RUN!!
what vw said is irrelevant: that was 30 years ago. the tires they were
referring to were passenger or light light truck tires with a different
manufacturing technology.

ronnie, jake, dr. tim?? any other vendors/shop owners/workers out there
who know and trust their local tire reps want to do some investigating??
