There is a factory column which goes along with the setup.  The column has
slot, and the rod has the tabs.

You can DIY, and I think Matt H is one who's done it and written it up.  I
did it on a bug once, and I imagine the bus is pretty much the same.

The locking column didn't seem the keep someone from stealing my bug though :(

&gt;do you have to weld tabs on the shaft like a bug ?

&gt;Anyone have factory instructions?

&gt;buses seem to &quot;disappear&quot; too much around here.........Or maybe just a BIG
