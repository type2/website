WHOA! Not everybody drives around a yellow submarine with vintagebus_dot_com 
plastered on the side. If you have never been to an Jerome event, don`t knock 
it BUD........
  What`s wrong with getting every bus we can back on the road,whether it be 
Jerome or any other yearly event. Thought that was what the whole idae was, 
evidently i was wrong. =)
