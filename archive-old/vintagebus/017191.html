--- George Lyle &lt;glyle_at_lenti.type2_dot_com&gt; mused:
&gt; What they're really saying is that, if they don't
&gt; have it in stock, they
&gt; don't want to order it.  Sometimes it's pure
&gt; laziness, sometimes they just
&gt; don't know how and don't want to bug the boss to
&gt; learn how.  90% of the
&gt; time they can talk the customer into buying
&gt; something from off the shelf
&gt; anyway.

I have had some pretty good luck with one of the FLATS
(kinda funny, huh?  Auto Tire Store? LOL) around here,
and the kid I usually deal with was not able to find
anything.  He called this morning and said he found
the Bridgestones, and apologized for not being able to
find them.  Also said that if I wait another 3 weeks
or so, I can get one free for every three that I
purchase.  Woohoo!  Since my rims aren't ready yet,
that'll be perfect!

&gt; I have a feeling that Wendy would call any tire a
&gt; &quot;pretty nice tire&quot; :)

I had the same thought.  When I purchased some tires a
while ago, though, the guy I dealt with talked me out
of some more expensive tires for my old Jetta, and got
me to buy some &quot;more driveable&quot; tires.  What I wanted
to purchase were more for the road rallying type, not
the daily driver type.  

&gt; did you put the &quot;RD&quot; in front of it, as in &quot;RD603V&quot;?
&gt;  Sometimes computers,
&gt; nice as they are, miss the part if one character is
&gt; missing.

I just discovered the &quot;RD&quot; needed to be in front about
5 minutes ago!  I know now...

&gt; Tire rack deal is a bit better if it includes
&gt; shipping, but if it were me

That is the total price, with FedEx 3 day.  It was
actually cheaper than shipping ground.  Also includes
tax - everything.  That is the exact amount I would
have to give them to get them to my door by Monday.

&gt; I'd go with the local dealer.  Keep the pump primed,
&gt; as it were.  If
&gt; there's a problem, then there's only one way to
&gt; point the finger as well!
&gt; 

That's why I'm leaning towards the local place.  Free
rotation every 5k, free balancing with each rotation,
plus a few other little things.  Since this will be a
daily driver, I would feel more comfortable getting
the road hazard.  It's cheap insurance.  Kinda like
the AAA vs. no AAA.  I'd rather fault on the side of
caution with 2 little kids and a wife.  I carry spare
stuff to fix if I can.  But, as with any vehicle
that's 30+ years old, I want to CYA.  How many people
drive their 30 year old cars every day?  

&gt; I've heard a rumor (also from a tire man) that some
&gt; vehicles in the U-Haul
&gt; fleet take our rare tire size.  Anyone else hear
&gt; this?

I heard this from the kid this morning at the FLATS.

Paul
