Subject: Cool it on the SOTO slams

I too am amongst the ex-SOTO members who let the membership lapse after
recieving too few newsletters. I am very active and supportive of another
very well known national bus club but am speaking as an individual in this
message.

I have always have enjoyed myself at the Summer SOTO meets and have had the
opportunity to have met quite a few of you there. Thom and ToddS for a
couple. It is my wish that time would permit me to attend more of the events
through out the year. This year, following the show, I was surprised to have
recieved a personal snail mail thank you from David Heard
&lt;dave_at_shocking_dot_com&gt; for dragging the Puck and Westy out to the event(s).
Additionally, I received a couple of the reveamped newsletters. Dead serious
and honest advice has been communicated to Dave as per my views on how to
regain interest in SOTO. What happens with it is up to the SOTO membership.

Personally, I think that politics and personal slams serve no postive for
the betterment of the VW scene in general. My stance is to encourage *any*
individual or group of folks who are interested in the preservation and
regular usage of VWs. Sure, there may or may not be merit in the differences
between yourselves and any club or any of its individual members. Even in my
most smart***ed moments I try to stay far away from personal slams. If
anything else I use self-depricating humor because I know who I am and what
I'm really like.

My suggestion is to contact Dave directly and work out the issues offline.
You never know who is lurking on the lists. Be cool.
