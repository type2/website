Hello fellow volkswagen enthusiast. Owning a volkswagen places you in a
special family. A family who looks out for each other, and whose main goal
is to have fun and enjoy their volkswagens. This June the members of GROOVE
(General Registry of Ozarks Volkswagen Enthusiasts) in Springfield Missouri
will proudly present our annual June Bug Jamboree. THIS SHOW IS FOR ALL
TYPES, WATER AND AIR COOLED! Click on the link for more info and hope to
see you there.
