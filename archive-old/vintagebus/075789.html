&gt; Hi Cal,
&gt; Check all three or more jets!  Checking the main only shows what fuel is
&gt; getting into the engine at lower to midddlish RPMs.  The air correction jet is
&gt; suposed to lean out the mixture from getting too lean at higher RPMS!!!

So perhaps I should replace the air correction jet with the old carb's as
well as the main.

&gt;   The more we think about it the more we feel your problem is either carb or
&gt; ignition related.  With your tight valve being a symptom not the cause of your
&gt; trouble.

I agree. I'm gonna do an oil change as well, and enrich the mix using the
volume control as you've suggested. I'd throw the old carb back in, but I
believe it's a fire hazard, as fuel was dripping out both sides of the
butterfly axle when the engine died last month. So, new carb - and
probably bad mixture. I've got 60 or so miles to go today in LA, and will
check the valve this morning before heading out, and also tomorrow
morning.

Thanks again!
