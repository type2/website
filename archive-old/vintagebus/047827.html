I am confused about the taillights in my 59 6V truck.  I put the round glass
kind in, and the wires to the taillights come on ( test lamp)when the
appropriate switch is switched (turn signal, brake, headlight/headlight
halfway for taillight)    The turn signals look good, the taillights look
good, but in combination they don't.  The right side was dim, so I though
maybe I have a 12V bulb in there, and scared up a used bulb that made the
lights as bright as the left side.   I also replaced the bulb holder as I
found a nice one at Octobugfest, and the bezel, as I found a nice one of those
too.  :)   Before, on the right the taillight was dim, but the brake/turn
signal more noticable.  Tonight I had a friend step on the brakes with the
headlights on while I looked, and the right side brightened a tad, while the
left side dimmed a tad.    Tad, schmad, they oughta make a bright and bold
statement.       maybe something is crossed, but I made sure I hooked up the
running light wire to the side of the taillight that lit the dimmer part of
the bulb.   hmm....   oh, yes, all is grounded well.    I tried buying new
bulbs at Al's (FLAPS), but they had no 6Vers, and suggested Shmucks's (another
FLAPS).  tomorrow .

Needless to say, I can't drive it without good lights.
