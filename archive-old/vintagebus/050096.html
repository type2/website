Subject: Empi Filter/Pump


I have this old Empi bolt-on oil filter that I got somewhere. I remember
Bob Hoover carrying on about how these things wouldn't work because 9 out
of 10 of them he'd measured were too small and rattled around in the case.
He'd been searching for ones that were the right size so he could use them
but eventually gave up. The implication is that a bolt-on filter pump is a
Good Thing as long as it fits properly.

So I measured it and it's dead-on 2.7570, same as a stock VW oil pump.

Should I put this on? Does anybody run one of these?

There's a big outlet presumably for an external oil cooler, just put a bolt
in that and seal it up good? I don't need an oil cooler. This is the South.
It's always cold here.
