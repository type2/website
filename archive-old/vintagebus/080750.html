Subject: Re: [VB] Transmission oil seal question

If that's the case, then folks need to learn to line the engine up
perfectly before pushing forward to engage it with the tranny.

I long ago memorized what the engine looks like when it's in there. There
are several landmarks I use when installing the engine. I check that it's
absolutely centered in the left/right plane. For height, I check that the
flat tin areas that have the stamped cylinder numbers (the flat horizontal
parts of the upper head tins) are about 1/2&quot; below the center of the two
engine-room seals on the sides, and that they are absolutely even with
them front to rear. At that point, the engine is perfectly lined up, and
good to go. As a final check, if I'm not lazy, I'll skootch under and make
sure the lower studs are level with the holes, but I really don't do that
step anymore - I know when it's correct.

At that point, when I push forward on the engine (riding on a floor jack),
it goes in. All that's left to do is hang a wrench on the genny pulley to
rotate the engine around a bit while jiggling it in the final inch -
that's to line up the splines from the tranny shaft with their mates
inside the gland nut.

It should never be necessary to hang any weight on the tranny shaft. My
1.5 ton floor jack is small, and cost $30 at Sears 15 years ago. Lives
under the bed in the bus.

&gt; The trans input shaft can move up and down more than you might think!
