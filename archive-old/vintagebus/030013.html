&gt; Have an off-the-wall ebrake question... we had a thread here lately that
&gt; dealt with what cables went on what years, and I have a variant:
&gt; my 70 has a 72 suspension (front disks, rear axles and backing plates from
&gt; a 72) BUT still has the 70 ebrake cables. If I remember right, it has the
&gt; 70 ebrake hardware. Now, the 72 cable is about 5 cm shorter than the 70
&gt; (and is put together differently)  which I believe is why I kept the 70
&gt; cable. However, the swap put my ebrake cable right at the ends of the
&gt; adjustment screws. They hold, but not enough to make me happy. And there
&gt; certainly is no room for further wear adjustments; the adjuster nuts are
&gt; right down at the end of the threads.

I ran into this once.  I used a spacer on the sleeve of the e brake
cable.  It has been years, but I think it was a alternator pulley spacer
between the sleeve and the metal frame tube.  The 3/8 - 1/2&quot; was enough
to get some adjustment back.

Good Luck,
