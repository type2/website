Subject: '54 SC and '55 Kombi updates - M-Codes!

'54 SC - Got my factory letter Saturday, here are the M-Codes for you M-Code
phreaks:

M10 - Dust filters for engine compartment - What does this mean exactly?
M18 - ?
M20 - MPH speedometer
M70 - Tilt and Bows  (oh yeah!)
M83 - ?
M86 - ?
M90 - Safety Glass Windshields
M103 - Heavy Duty shock absorbers, I assume this means in the rear only
since it's a truck. The original lever shocks are missing so anyone have any
further information on what this means? I was curious if it's a different
lever shock configuration because there is an extra bolt hole right above
the spring plates.

On a side note, both my vehicles have 18, 83, and 86, which are
unidentified.  Possible some sort of export code since they both are from
Hollywood, CA?  It would not surprise me if M18 was sealed beam headlights.
Also, both Buses have 2 holes to the left of the dash pod, empty.  I've been
told one was a lighter, the other unknown, could possibly be M83 and M86(?),
more likely just dealer-installed stuff.  If anyone has any other listings
of M-Codes for their early Bus, please send 'em to me.

Here's the address for the letter - send 10 DM  cash for it:
Stiftung Auto Museum
Volkswagen, Dieselstrasse
35, 28436 Wolfsburg,
Germany
--------------------
'55 Kombi - Installed my used Bus 36hp exhaust along with a excellent used
36hp heater box.  Interestingly, the earlier 36hp heater boxes are slightly
different in shape and in the way they mount to the stale-air tin.

Keep driving it daily,
Everett Barnes
