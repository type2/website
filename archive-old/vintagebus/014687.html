Well, I have no problem with what you are saying.  My problem is with those 
people who attack those who are just trying to help.   If you want to hack a 
bus and make it look like a spaceship....  All the power to you!  (In fact 
it sounds kinda cool!)  But for those of you who don't agree with something 
someone posts, why write the negative comments????   It adds no value to 
anyone who spends the time trying to help those who need the help.  In fact 
it does just the opposite.  It is very annoying reading counterproductive 
e-mail.  My goal is to help those who are interested in the help.  For those 
who don't want it....   Just remain silent!  If I say something that is 
wrong... Then correcting it is the good thing to do.  But just 
non-productive complaining is not the thing to do.

To me, the greatness of vintage VW is the fact that total strangers can come 
together and help each other and be completely satisfied.  Reading 
non-productive b*tching does not reach that goal.

All this leads me to a saying I have heard from parents all over.  It would 
be good for people who like to post negative comments to take a lesson from 
their parents......  &quot;If you have nothing good to say...  Then don't say 
anything at all!&quot;

Sincerly...tired of hearing complants!!!

&gt;To me, being forced to maintain some arbitrary standard of vintage
&gt;correctness is no less anonymous than ponying up $x for a new econobox.
&gt;Do what you want to do, not what others tell you to.  If what you want is
&gt;to make your bus bone stock thats cool... if you want a little spice in
&gt;your soup, have fun too.
&gt;
&gt;peas,
&gt;
