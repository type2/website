I saw this on the vw newsgroup. Might be a good deal for someone looking.
Call him, not me.

&gt;I have a 1962 23 window bus for sale.  The bus needs to be restored, but
&gt;it has all of the parts.  I have a new (Dec 98) 1914CC Engine for this
&gt;bus w/a Engle 110 Cam, ported &amp; polished oversized heads, Dual Webber 44
&gt;Carbs, new alternator, Doghouse style cooler, external Oil filter, Berg
&gt;Oil Pump, 1 5/8 exhaust with a 2 5/8 muffler.  The bus has all three
&gt;seats, is very straight, and many extra parts.  I have 1969 &amp; 1972 front
&gt;beams ( to convert to Disc brakes), I have an extra 1500 CC motor, extra
&gt;heads, both front &amp; rear deluxe bumpers, an extra 40MM progressive
&gt;Webber Carb, and extra body parts to help with the restoration of this
&gt;bus.  I have recepits for the motor which cost $4000 at my local shop.
&gt;I have included some pictures of this bus.  My price is $5500 firm &amp; the
&gt;bus is located in Newark, CA (SF Bay Area).  Please feel free to call me
&gt;at 510-795-0144 or email me for more info.
