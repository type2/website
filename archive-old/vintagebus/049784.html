The kit is
&gt;compleatly intact including the child cot, screen cover for rear hatch and
&gt;filler seat for the walk thru.



I thought the rear hatch screen wasn't fitted until the '68 models.  Am I
wrong?

Do I need one for my '66?  There are no fastening points on my bus for the
screen, as far as I know.
