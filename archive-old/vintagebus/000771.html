Hi Ronnie,
Definitely!  It also keeps out water from getting pushed into the left wheel 
bearings that is being splashed up by the right tire.  We have been able to 
seal the same by packing the area where the cable enters the spindle overfull 
with grease, but it just is not as sure a fix as using the seal.   Eric&amp;Barb
