Subject: Crew cab in Oklahoma

Hi List,
I was approached yesterday while sitting in my crew
cab in a parking lot by a guy who says he has a 63
double cab for sale. I'm going to look at it later and
take some pics. It's way down in the Ouchita
(Wash-a-tah) Nat'l forest area in SE Oklahoma. I don't
know how to build a link so you guys can check it out,
so if anyone knows how and would let me email the pics
to them and post them on a link let me know. This is
all contingent on me finding the guy today. I'll keep
ya posted. 

3DPete
Buck - 63 crew cab
