I've seen pictures of a 54 prototype binz!
Supposedly they only made ONE!!!!!!

was registered as a 55!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

&lt;&lt; Ok I just got off the phone with a friend of mine that restores old Ch*vys.

He had told me about a week ago about this old double cab he ran across in

his travels. I asked him to go out and talk to the owner for me since I am

600 miles away. Frank said that he just got back from looking at and talking

with the owner and was told it is a 1954.  Question did they make them back

then? Frank said it has an old California plate on it with 1961 tabs and

that it looks complete with bumpers and all.

I plan on going down with cash on Sunday to look at it and probably buy it,

but just was curious if it really could be that old, I mean I know they made

barndoor single cabs but I didn't think they made crews.
