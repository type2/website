Subject: Electric Fuel Pump

Is there any way to hook up an electric fuel pump so that it only gets
power when there is oil pressure?

And, does any one know where I may look to find fuel pump rebuild
kits, I have an old fuel pump that is rebuildable that was on my 40h
when I got it. It's shot of course, but if I can find a rebuild kit
for it I would like to get my hands on a few, just need ot know where
to start looking (I've inquired at FLAPS already)

Thanks

-Matthew
