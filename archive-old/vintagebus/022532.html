Hi all, here is another query for the wise ones on the list:

Sorting through old papers, I have come across a picture of a rather
strange VW bus: 

Instead of four wheels, this one has tracks; 

The body-shell is a split-screen bus.

The track-train is of the Christie type, with single-pin track-links.

Suspension seems to be through torsion bars under the vehicle floor, with
the drive sprocket at the rear.

The number of road-wheels is not visible on the picture.

I dont know where the picture came from, whether it could be a fake of what; 
anyone know of such a bitza ?

TIA,

Ron the Frog, in Darkest Paraguay.

PS If you are interested, I'll scan the picture and email it to you. 

                 If a thing is worth doing,
                   its worth doing badly.
