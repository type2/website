I'm with Gary.  Took my great running '62 down to Santa Barbara (about 7
hours) for a vacation, hitting the OCTO show and the Classic on the weekend.
Mind you, this is my daily driver, but found the drive a mixture of every
extreme sensation along the way.  Didn't even mind when my coil pulled out
of the fan shroud and I broke down in front of a mansion in Beverly Hills
during the weekend.  I'm sure the home's owner did, though.
