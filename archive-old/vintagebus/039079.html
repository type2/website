Subject: Jerome attendee poll
Date: Tue, 1 Sep 1998 13:10:39 -0500 

For those of you going to Jerome, I'd like compile a list of who you are
and will forward the complete list to each of you that respond (not a
general post to the list).  That way maybe we can keep an eye out for
each other.

The only problem is I'm leaving Friday morning (9/4) so any responses
after that will go unanswered.

So send the following info to  mike_gensler_at_udscorp_dot_com (NOT to the
list!!)  by Thursday midnight:

Name/distinguishing traits:
Bus type/color/distinguishing traits:
Arival date:

Thanks and SEE YA THERE!!
