Did anyone see the pictures added to Thom's site at www.vintagebus_dot_com of a
rusted out side loader single cab?  They were on there Friday evening.
Looked to me like an plain jane orange single cab but after the guys pulled
it out of the shed (I guess the cab seperated from the bed because of bad
rust), you could plainly see the side-loader door on it.  It was really far
gone though - I think that roof funneled water into that bed for years.
