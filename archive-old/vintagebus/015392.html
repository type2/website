speaking of which... the vw oil filtration system was designed back in the 
day before there was 5 million types of oil and all this synthetic stuff and 
all these new york city taxi cab tests being done. if your oil is constantly 
being circulated throughout the engine what does it need to be filtered of? 
the vw oil filtration system appears to be designed to stop only chunks of 
metal from internal components breaking down. with normal maintenance it 
appears to be more than adequate. that large mesh screen probably helps to 
expedite the flow too. just my $.02.
