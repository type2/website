Subject: Re: [VB] Middle seat question

[...]


 That piece is for the rear seat. For the middle seat, he needs a flat plate
with keyholes in it. Like this:

 &gt; Gang:
&gt;
&gt; So, looking at the web, I see something like this:
&gt; http://www.wolfsburgwest_dot_com/cgi-bin/wwshowpn.cgi?PN=221801419
&gt;
&gt; Does that mean that the new metal floors, don't come with seat brackets
&gt; welded in?  I am curious who has done this type of fix and can provide info.
&gt;

&gt; &gt; PS Not like I have any back seats for a early model (or can find any) for
&gt; that matter.

&gt; &gt; ...The last thing we want to do is drill a hole through the
&gt; &gt; floor and bolt them that way...
