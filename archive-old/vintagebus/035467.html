I dunno about this, I think I remember my 67 having the indent.

&lt;&lt; But... i have looked at pix of your 58, and i have looked at an original
 58 safari bus in person and there is one difference.  On the 62 and older
 busses only the safari busses got the upper indent in the window channel,
 this doesnt look to be added to yours... so even though you have the
 correct securing plate, you dont have the indent, which makes the
 installation not as the VW factory intended. &gt;&gt;
