Subject: clutch throwout shaft
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.10.10004061540540.22149-100000_at_users.anet-stl_dot_com&gt;

hello all,

I am trying to find a spare clutch throwout shaft for my bus... but am
having spotty luck...

I found what i need at long transaxle but they have a service charge of
$25.00 on any order under a certain ammount so that is silly to do for a
$20 or so part.

What i want:
the shaft for the bent arm with the pinch bolt rather than the splines.  I
would prefer one of those dunebuggy welded superstrong ones, but a stock
one will do if need be.

Long had one that fit both splined and pinchbolt style (groove to clear
bolt machined in), welded, heavy duty.  Im sure that he bought it
somewhere, rather than made it, anyone know another source for this item?

I could upgrade to splined, but i like the pinchbolt style, easier to
diasssemble.  If i can find what i want then i wont have to upgrade :)

thanks,

Steve
