I don't have any other details except to say that EV's are great! My
electric Thing is saving me money while the price of gas goes up past
$1.70/gal. here in California. Fill the batteries every month with a
buck's worth of distilled water and $1.50 worth of Reddy Kilowatt and
I'm good for 30 miles a day.
