Subject: [VB] bore size?


&gt; I have question for anybody with some experience with larger bore engine,s
&gt; on a motor with 90.5,s are the heads bored for 92mm?
&gt; the same as 92mm cyl,s  but the liners just have thicker walls.
&gt;
&gt; cause someone told me 92mm heads are same size.

Yes, both the same . Case bore is 96 mm,
and head bore is 98 mm . I'm doing a set
today.
