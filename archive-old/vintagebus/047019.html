Hi Paul,
How big of diameter are these tires measured on the outside?  What you have 
quoted sound a little small.  The stock JAN 1964-on buses used a 25-25.5&quot; 
diameter and the 1955-early 64 used about 26-27&quot; diameter.  The smaller the 
diameter the higher you will have to RPM the engine.  The bigger the diameter 
the lower the RPMs.  Of course with the bigger tires you will have a little 
lower speed climbing hills, but unless you live in Colorado State or in the 
Alps you will need more speed on the flats.     Eric&amp;Barb
