Subject: Bug&amp;Bus toy at Wallyworld / San Diego listees
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I know everyone is sick of hearing about these toys  =)
But I finally got off my ass and headed down to pick up a battery for the bug 
and saw 3 of em.....the girl checked for more , but none....I bought the 3.
So if any listees are having trouble finding one.. I've got 2 up for 
grabs...p-mail me and we'll work something out.

The other thing...I'm finally packing up and heading back out west in about 3 
weeks.  New job, good money,  blah blah
We'll be living in Murrieta and working in Temecula...so if any listees have 
any info on clubs and whatnot...I'd love to hear from ya.
Any leads on a new bus for me would be sweet too.  =)
