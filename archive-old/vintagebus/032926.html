&lt;&lt;  But I have noticed that different  VW starters  are different lengths and
I may have a shorter one in there.  You may want to think about getting a
shorter one when you next need a  starter, if that is the differnce. &gt;&gt;
Hi Clara,
Think that the shorter starter you mention only comes in 12 volt.  Not in 6
volt.  Eric&amp;Barb
