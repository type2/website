Subject: Re: [VB] 67 camper steering column color?

commercial buses got black wheels and knobs and steering columns.   westys 
and passenger models had white wheels, knobs , columns.

Anyone know what colour white steering columns were painted?   was it the 
interior white or a different white.  hm, my 61 deluxe has a white column, 
interior is SWR, so it is a silver white?

&lt;&lt;  plan on painting my steering column but wasn't sure about the color. The 
 inside of the bus is off-white and the steering wheel is black. I'm thinking 
 I should paint the column black but thought I'd check first. It is a 67 
 kombi that I have started a camper conversion on. I have a 67 westy interior 
 I have put in but I'm missing the ice box and the wooden bow things for the 
 headliner. That can wait for next year. &gt;&gt;
