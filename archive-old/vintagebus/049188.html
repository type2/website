Seems to me a 110v bathroom heater with an extension cord could warm up the interior of a bus and defrost the windshield while you're caffeinating in the morning. Get fancier with a timer of correct amperage. I suspect electrical costs are cheaper than the gas the engine would burn to heat the interior. Don't neglect to warm up the engine.
