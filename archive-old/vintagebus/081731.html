Subject: Paddys Wagens '05 trip report

4I haven't been to Paddy's Wagens yet! said my lovely wife. 4You have
that weekend off, let's go! she continued. Awww man, another campout?
Great I thought. The last campout was kinda chilly at night and I
wondered if the bus was going to make it home. 


So, of course, I got all excited too. You see, I hadn't been to a
Paddy's Wagens since the very first one maybe 5 years ago. I walked out
to the barn last Tuesday and pulled the front wheels to free the brake
adjusters, repacked the wheel bearings, little maintenance things that a
bus sometimes needs. Brake adjusters freed, bearings packed, brakes
adjusted, I checked the oil. Yep still making a little oil at rest and
the telltale sign of gas leaking down the side of the carb. Sure signs
of either a float valve stuck or an overeager fuel pump. I rapped on the
carb a couple times to free the valve, fired the Award Winning Burrito
Express (AWBE) up and pulled out of the barn and into the yard for
packing. 


It rained and snowed Wednesday and Thursday so I just knew we were going
to have a great weekend for camping. Friday 6 A.M. Get out of work,
drive home, catch an hour nap. Final loading procedures done, puppies
dropped off at puppysitters, fired up AWBE and off we went to yet
another campout. She stalled at the red light in town, was a brass
plated bitch to restart. Sure is loading up with fuel. Onward anyways,
after a stop at Advance Auto to pick up a carb kit. They had in stock, I
already checked. 


Down 321 we go, bus is happy, running cool but rich. Onto 85 to 485
(nice way to miss Charlotte) to 77S. Stop for lunch and fuel, oil
level's O.K., engine's nice and cool but that's to be expected with a
stuck float valve. Down 77, no other buses in sight. Past Exit 62 where
I used to keep a stash of ignition parts for when I'd break down at that
exit every other Sunday. Exit 17 gets here and we get off. A stop at the
Kitty Store (Food Lion) for last minutes and into the campground we go.
Other buses already there, we pick a spot not too far from the bathrooms
and unpack and set up. We had decided to have steaks for supper, so
after the set up and firewood gathering, we pulled the bag of steaks out
of the cooler to discover we had grabbed ribs! No big deal, neighbors
had some John Boy and Billy's grillin' sauce (thanks guys), a parboil of
the ribs then onto the cool scallop shell shaped grill, corn and taters
to go with. Yum! 


Dinner cooked and eaten, we listen as buses pull in, walk around and do
howdy-do's howya been's and beentoolong's. Darkness creeps up and the
fire still hadn't quite lit yet. Phil keeps throwing pine needles on,
Flame on! Then flame gone. I finally pick up the plywood windbreak I use
on the 3burner and start waving it. The fire wanted air and after a bit
it took off just fine, thank you very much. Folks pull in, help Richard
put up his shade thingy, people come and go at the fire since it's kinda
chilly and the fire warms nice. I finally fade and go to sleep having
been on the go for about 40 hours with an hour nap. Didn't sleep that
great 'cause I kept getting woke up by sharp elbow jabs because I was so
tired I was snoring. 


Saturday dawned but I didn't see that part. Finally wake, make coffee,
scratch then start the chouriso for breakfast burritos. Other folks are
cooking too so in less than no time we were all eating and joking and
doing the breakfast burrito thing. Nothing finer on this world than FMBC
breakfast Burritos, Waffle House got nothing on us! 


After washing up I decide to check out the float valve deal on AWBE.
Open the hatch, remove carb, go to picnic table and turn down Hayseed
Dixie. Pulled the top of the carb off and the first thing I noticed is
that the carb float didn't. That was O.K. Because I had e-mailed Mark
Deering and asked him to bring if he had, just in case. Dropped the
float into place and it bobbed up and down just as pretty as could be.
Changed the float valve too because it was acting a little funny, set
the choke so it comes on a bit sooner, button up the carb, reinstall,
close the lid because yes, I am that good dammit and she fired up on the
second crank once we got fuel in the bowl. Listen as AWBE goes through
the warmup, a slight miss every once in a while that I figured was a
loaded up plug, she idles down and keeps smoothing out. Ahhhhh! Mark,
THANK YOU!!!!! 


Hang out, start the corned beef and cabbage about 1, hang out more, hit
myself in the ankle with the ax while I'm getting more firewood. Said
unkind words, didn't feel like it was bleeding too much and I could
still walk so I finished what I was doing, let the fire restart, tend
dinner, hang out and talk. Dinner ready, I hunted down my lady, and
somehow many people showed up, several bearing food, so we all ate very
well. I had never cooked corned beef and cabbage before but it just
became a regular on our menu. 


Lorie brought cake, so we ate that too, darkness fell again and next
thing I know people are showing up at the site for door prizes and
campfire sitting. Maddog wasn't quite sure how to give out the mounted
largemouth bass so I helped him out and Charles Webb won it. I thought
it was one of those singing basses so i was really pushing the battery
operated feature (the crowd didn't know what the prize was). We all
thanked Maddog for letting us come and camp with him and everyone
drifted off for more fire hopping and talking and adult beverage
partaking and all that great camping stuff. I finally faded a little
before midnight. 


Sunday dawned but I chose to ignore it until the sun was really up. Warm
yesterday's coffee, scramble some eggs and wander over to Steve's for
pancakes and eggs and sausage. Steve didn't know I can eat pancakes,
lots of pancakes. Pack the bus, say goodbyes, AWBE fires right up and we
ease on out of the campground. 


AWBE running better than she has in a while, I watch the oil pressure
and temp gauges dance as we go up hill and down, stop for fuel and
lunch, then the rest of the way home was uneventful. AWBE got a bit warm
a couple times as we ran up steeper hills with a 30 mph headwind. So
wound down yet another Full Moon Bus Club campout and road trip and so I
guess I should stop now. Pictures posted on the Full Moon Bus Club
website in the event pictures category.
