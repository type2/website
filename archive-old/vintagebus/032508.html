&lt;&lt; Alright. Now you listen here bitch. Yes I said bitch. Why because I have a 
temper. Because I work in thermed forces and have to come home and listen to 
pukes like you fill my inbox with messages of crap. Lemme tell ya a few 
things. one, you can't call me a &quot;bad businessman&quot;, because I'm not a 
business man. Fuck you. Dont buy anything of mine. I give a damn if anyone on 
here buys anything off of me. 2.Ya wanna call me a liar, you better come do 
it to my face. (i'm in GA BTW, be my fuckin guest) You try organizing 1387, 
yes 1387 emails in my inbox right now. Aint gonna happen chief. Aint got the 
time or patience. Wanna hear something else, if anyone is close to me, they 
get parts for free. Because I dont have to take my time (which I seem to have 
virtually none of) to take them off and ship them etc...Is that bad business 
too? So what if I put them on 2 auction sites. VB auction is for no more than 
advertisement purposes. I have had numerous auctions on there and not a 
successful sale yet. Why? Because anyone can get an ID. Thousands of teenage 
punks (probably much like yourself) can just go on their and get an ID and 
fuck with all kinds of auctions. I will never rely on it for any more than a 
free billboard. Me get a life? Yeah you got me there. Look at the time I'm 
wasting writing you...And a Job? Listen here buddy. Of all things. I am 
proudly serving in the United States army and if you or any other jackass out 
there who aint got what it takes dont like it, kiss my ass. It should be a 
mandatory thing in this country. It'd be a helluva lot better place. Sounds 
like maybe you should think about it...
