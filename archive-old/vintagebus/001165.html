According to Thoms advice, I poked in all the numbers but can't still figure
out one of the numbers on the plate behind the seat.

It says

361
UP 265 BLUE

So, it was sent to Portland OR USA, it is a LHD Right side double cab
painted blue (dove blue) but what is the 361????

Also, the shifter is close to the front seat so is it a split or tunnel
transaxle... how can I tell from the outside?  I'll crawl under it tonight
and look for some adapter plate.

Thanks so much

David
