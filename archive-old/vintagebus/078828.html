Subject: Mid America Swap meet...

Hi all,

John Baker, were you at the Mid America Motorworks swap Meet yesterday in
Effingham, IL?  So were we, I wish we had made arrangements to meet up!  I
scored a nice Securit pre-'68 windshield, and two good matching 40hp heads,
rocker arms and covers all for $15. Woooo Hoooo!  I can't wait for their June
Show and swap meet.  But next stop is the huge MVVC Michigan &quot;Vintage VW
Festival&quot; in Yipsilanti, MI in May.  Lots of Buses make it to that one too.
