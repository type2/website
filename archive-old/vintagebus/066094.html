&gt; Anyone know what became of the buy and sell page of the

Yep, it's imperfect. It's the best freeware thing I could find. If anybody
knows a better script (that will run in in *nix), or if there are any PHP
wizards, please reply and we'll improve it.

Classifieds: Frankly, Everett Barnes is coddling you people to an amazing
degree, and has been for years,  and if you haven't thanked him lately, you
should. There are no other hobbyist classifieds *anywhere* that even begin
to approach what he gives you, in interface quality or in bandwidth, much
less providing it for free. I don't even want to think about how much it
costs him to keep the thing on line or how much time he spends on it. It
really doesn't make too much sense for us to compete with it, as long as it
lasts. IMHO.
