Hello all........As for what's on my parcel tray. Well, not too much. I
have 2 church keys. Why 2 you ask? I'm not sure. I found an extra one
and just tossed it there. Of course the way I lose things I should make
a necklace out of one of them and never take it off. The only other
things are a pen and small mileage notebook. Better known as my gas
guage. And of course a pair of high quality sun glasses I got at a
garage sale for 2 bucks. Of course I  have more than eough in the back
of the bus to compensate for whats not up front. I'm still trying to
complete Eric&amp;Barb's emergency parts and tool list just in case, but I'm
still a ways off. But i do carry a laminatd copy of the list in my bus..
This list is awesome. Much thanks again to Erik&amp;Barb for sending it my
way. Well everyone have a great day TGIF !!!!!   Shawn
