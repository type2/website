Subject: Subject: sound-deadening ??

I recently sold a '57 bus that had been rebuilt by a friend. He had
installed shaped polystyrene between the body and all interior panels
and fitted heavy duty synthetic underfelt under the carpets. With a
stock exhaust the engine was barely audible and the only noise at 55 mph
was wind and tyre related. There was absolutely no drumming from
vibrating panels.

Given that polystyrene isn't the most effective sound deadening
material (he chose it on price) the same approach with materials made
for the job would achieve results.

When I used to drive my  dc on longer journeys I would always stuff a
duvet on top of the gear I stowed under the rear seat. This would cut
engine noise and body drumming in half at least.
