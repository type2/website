Here in the Arizona deserts it is common to run
vehicles with what the locals call &quot;Bunny Bars&quot;. In
the Spring and early Summers all of the folks who can
afford to escape Southern Arizona head to the high
country. &lt;don't go there, it would be a cheap and
uncreative come back!&gt;

This is the deal. Young rabbits don't know jack about
on coming traffic and quick death tend to dart out
from their dark desert world into the flow in order to
get a better look at the bright light scene. When they
blaze out in front of the oncoming vehicles their eyes
bulge and they jump up about the same time that they
make contact with the windshield or slightly below.
The &quot;Bunny Bars&quot; help keep the vertical flight down
below the windshield.
Bunnys who do know better and are wise enough to
remain off of the roadways grow up to be known as
&quot;Jack&quot; Rabbits.
