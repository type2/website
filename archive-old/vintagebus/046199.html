&lt;&lt; well, I would like powder too.  And it would be nice to get them painted 
like the original- black where the tire sits, on the inner face, then only 
Silver White on the outside face.   So do powder coat places do that sort of 
thing? &gt;&gt;

Hi Clara,
Our last batch of rims (18) we had done were completely zinc primered, 
semi-gloss black on the inner side and tire area, then a white coating on the 
sprayed on the outer side without need of masking.  They turned out just like 
VW did them originally, for only $35.00 each which included sand blasting.  A 
couple of years ago we had rims done in the same white color we picked and 
within six months the sharp edges of the rims started to rust through the 
coating.  This apparently was due to the fact that light color powder 
coatings for some reason go on thinner than darker coatings.  So when we 
found out that the zinc primer had come out we figured on having it sprayed 
on the next set of rims.   Eric&amp;Barb
