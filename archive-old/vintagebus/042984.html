&gt; Could be that the tie rods are improperly adjusted, putting the vehicle 
way out of alignment. You can check this with a tape measure by pointing 
the wheels straight and then measuring from rim-to-rim at the back of the
 wheels and then rim-to-rim at the front of the wheels. The distance 
should be the same for both, making the front tires *both* point straight 
when you point them straight-


Wrong!
You need a toe-in of about 1/8 inch in front.  Two yardsticks held
together can do the measurement - see Muir for details.

&gt; The hardest part, IMHO, is removing the steering wheel itself and finding
 a good place to remove the steering gear. On early buses (up to '67), the steering gear and the arm going up to the steering wheel are one assembly. They pull down, out of the bus, but you almost need one of those &quot;pits&quot; to pull one out into...or you need to jack the bus up about 4 feet off the ground (safely).
&gt; 


wrong here.... I have done this job on the 67 by raising only about one
foot and change. May have had it as much as 20 inches raised. Use the
emrgency brake and place the trannie in gear.
Once the bracket is off and the steering wheel is off, and the box is
undone, you can angle it foward. I may have removed the driver seat as
well, but that is trivial as it slides off anyway.
