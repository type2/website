Hi Michael,
First see where and why it is leaking!  If a seal has gone bad replace it.  
If a fastener has loosened tighten it.  If your muffler has cracked  get it 
welded, and if it is rusting through replace it cause it ain't going to get 
better.  Yes, especially during the summer a hole in your muffler will create 
higher engine temps and cause damage due to this if not gauge monitored.  
More importantly your brain is your friend and you do not want to fry it or 
any of your passengers slowly with monoxide poisioning!
