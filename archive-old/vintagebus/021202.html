&gt; Hi bus people, A week ago I picked up my first ever sunroof bus. It's a
&gt; project bus in need of some body work, deluxe trim, rust repair, etc. But
&gt; it's got the hole in the roof so I'm happy. Anyway the sunroof came
&gt; rolled up inside the bus, I never knew these were so heavy and had so
&gt; many pieces. From what I can figure out looking in the Bentley workshop
&gt; manual I'm mainly missing the aluminum guide rails that screw to the bus
&gt; body and the &quot;tensioning strip&quot; shown at the top of page A-50 in the
&gt; Bentley. If anybody out there has these for sale please let me know. Also
&gt; is there an exploded view of a sunroof somewhere on the Internet? So I
&gt; could see how everything goes together and if I'm missing anything else.
