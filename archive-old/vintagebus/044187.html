understanding wife.&lt;&lt;

Ah yes, speaking of the understanding wife:  I currently own 3 running ACVW's.  66 Camper, 73 Westy, and 71 Super Beetle.  I got the 73 Westy on the premise that it was a great price and I would throw on a paint job and double my money upon selling it.  Thing is, it's a great bus and I want to keep it, so how do I explain the air-cooled phenomenon to my wife when she asks, and i quote, &quot;Why do you need three??&quot;  I'm sure we all here can understand why I would want one split window, one bay window, and one Type 1. Really, I guess it's a good question, why do I need three?? It seems obvious to me, but How do I explain it?? Anybody else been in this situation?!?!?!?

Peace, John Baker
