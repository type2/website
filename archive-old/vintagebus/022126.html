It is that time of year again to try to get everyone in the Southeast to
get together for some good old fashioned VW fun.

With that in mind I would like to invite you to the 6th Annual Georgia
Vintage Volkswagen Show at Southern Polytechnic State University in
Marietta, sponsored by Peach State Transporters, the Georgia chapter of
NEATO.

The show will be Sunday May 16, 1999 from 8am to 4pm.  Swap meet vendors
may begin setting up at 7am, everyone else can come in at 8am.

Photos from previous shows can be seen at:

The 1996 show was smaller because the venue we normally use was being used
for parking for the Olympics.  There was no show in 1997, &amp; I was so busy
running the show last year, I did not have time to take photos.  I am a bus
guy, so the photos reflect that, but we have as many Beetles, Karmann Ghias,
Things, &amp; Type 3's (combined) as we have buses.  Last year was the first
year we had more Beetles than buses.

We are having a canned food drive for Must Ministries in Marietta and are
asking everyone attending to please donate 2 cans of food.

Admission for spectators is $1
Admission for non-judged car show is $1 (includes car &amp; driver)
Admission for trophy-class car show is $10 (includes car &amp; driver)

Swap meet space is by parking space and $10 per parking place

Cars entered in the trophy classes should be at the show no later than 11am.
Judging will be done by people's choice.  All entrants will be given a
judging ballot form and ballots will be collected between 11:30am &amp; 2pm.
Trophys will be awarded at 2:30pm.

This has always been a fun laid back show for Vintage Volkswagen enthusiasts
and we normally have about 100 1979 &amp; earlier air-cooled VWs in attendance.

Show classes are:

Beetle up to 1957
Beetle 1958 to 1967
Beetle 1968 to 1979
Karmann Ghia
Thing (181)
Transporter (Bus) up to 1967
Transporter (Bus) 1968 to 1979
Type 3 &amp; 4

University rules prohibit pets, loud music, and alcoholic beverages.

Directions:

&gt;From I-75 take Exit 112, the Lower 120 Marietta Loop.  Go west.  After
crossing Highway 41 (Cobb Parkway), Southern Polytechnic State University
will be on the left.
