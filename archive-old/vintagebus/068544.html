Subject: Re: [VB] Drunk Driver Convicted

&gt;If the judicial systems n Canada and the U.S. had any balls they would
take the one great law from Saudia Arabia. When a person is caught, and
has been driving drunk, at the seen of an accident after such a horrific
incident such as this, a bullet from a revolver is put into there head.
No jury, no waist of money, eccept for the 70 cents for the bullet,
situation resolved. No more drunk driver only body in body bag. &lt;

Words of wisdom that needed repeated.  Amen brother Mike.

Not say driving with a beer or two in your system is horrible, but good God 
do you have to be stupid drunk to end up in the wrong lane towards oncoming 
traffic.

Such a sad story.

Adrian
