&gt;Please tell me; is there usually a swap area for BBTA? Do people &gt;set up
shop by there buses? Is this practice frowned upon?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks! Joe F.




When I was there last year, there wasn't any real swap area.  A few folks
had a few parts up for sale and to give away, and Ted Finesmen was selling
some nice looking bus jewelry.  But I don't believe I saw any full fledged
business's set up shop.
