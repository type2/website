Hello, I've got a leaky rear axle and was going to replace the seal today. There is no play in the wheel, but definitely a balsy rumble when I spin it. So I figure I'll replace the bearing too. Since I've got plans this afternoon, I'm going to do it tomorrow, and today I'll buy a new bearing and let the tranny fluid drain (all 4 plugs).

My question is: should I buy a bearing puller or just try prying the thing out? I'd like to get it done tomorrow and don't want to spend a lot of time getting it out. Are there different types of pullers? How would I know which puller to buy? Do I get it at the FLAPS or the VW parts store?

Thanks,
-Wilder
