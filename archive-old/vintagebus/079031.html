With regard to those &quot;black accordion kinda tubes&quot;.......

With some of those tubes, those big fat &quot;corrugations&quot; are actually threads,
and you can shorten the overall length just by screwing them together. If you
can't screw them together to be as short as you require, unscrew them
completely, cut off some measured amount of the inside piece, then screw them
back together. You may have to cut some off the inside insulation.

The end fittings are another story. There were bushings available to reduce
the inside diameter. The bushings look like, and may be, asbestos. Use
something else if you have to reduce the inside diameter.
