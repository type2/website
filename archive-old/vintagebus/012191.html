a copy of an artical (long) from HAMPSHIRE VW OWNERS CLUB
that my friends sent me from england (along with
some really cool split club window decals, see
them on the swap panel at pomona this weekend,
lettered up with the BUSES by the BRIDGE III
flyer on the side)

   STAR ATTRACTIONS IN 1999
Vintage VW buffs are all talking about BAD CAMBERG
the event which has become an international Mecca for pre-1957 VWs, held every 4 years in this small German town in the Taunus region. Event organiser and Vintage Guru, Willi Lottermann has had health problems over the past few years.
   I (not me) saw him at another event earlier this year and am pleased to report that he was looking very well considering a gall bladder operation two weeks earlier. However, he was still unsure of exactly when his 1999 event would take place, other then that it would be in the later half of June.
    Promted by several of you asking if there was a date yet I (not me) rang him this month. The phone was answered by his son, Marcus, who told me (not I) that he was back in the clinic for more tests and that the date still has not been fixed. When I (not me) hear more I (not me)will let you know.
