&gt;components and grease. What I'm concerned with is the transaxle.
&gt;The fire was hot enough to melt the brake hoses, axle boots, etc.
&gt;Do you think with the same good cleaning, seal change and brake
&gt;parts replacement it'll be useable? The motor that was in the Bus
&gt;has since gone through the same treatment and seems to be doing
&gt;fine.

When my '67 burned years ago, we pulled the transaxle, installed it in
another car, and it's still rolling to this day.  Pix of the burnt bus are
on my page.
