&gt; Does anyone have campgound reservations for the saturday night (April 12) of

i'd be interested in this since i'll be in my bus and coming down from oregon. expect to get to
byob on friday mid day (in plenty of time this year before the gate closes!!) but don't need a
hotel room for sure and don't know of any alternate camping locations other than street parking.
