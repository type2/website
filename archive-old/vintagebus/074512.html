Subject: RE: [VB] sticker makers?

Hi Bart,

I would encourage you to contact Jeremy Wolf at Graphicsworks in
Torrance, CA. He does a lot of different low-volume sticker jobs for me,
as well as several big corporate accounts. His pricing is reasonable and
he's VW-friendly.

(310) 212-7989

Tell him I sent you and he'll charge you double... ;)
