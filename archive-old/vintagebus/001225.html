&gt; would appriciate any experience other people here have had in reducing
&gt; freeway noise in their bus.

Putting interior panels in helps alot, do you have any seats in the back?
they reduce road noise too. I have my westy interior in now, and it's a
drastic difference compared to the days of rolling without any interior at
all :)
