The Clara says:
&gt;I just put a side step on my 65 a few weeks ago - the one that goes in
the jack points at the cargo doors... I dont like that way it makes the
bus have reduced ground clearance and look like it squats...  Maybe If I
paint the side step flat black it will be less noticable that the shiny
metal look.
&gt;
Flat black, yuck, your Bus wants to be purty.  It needs a shiny new bauble
every now and then to show off to the other Buses.  ;)

I can see Clara now, rolling in her &quot;sleeper&quot; Bus, everything flat black
Krylon with a phat Type IV engine out back.  Cut and turned front end, ground
down Type 3 rear brakes. 100 mph cruise speed, no sweat.  Schweeeeet.
