Man, I think I royally goofed.  The guy that has these P/C's for sale that I
posted about.  I forgot to post his email address.  DUH!!!!!!!!

 CRSPERFORMANCE_at_aol_dot_com

Here is the original message FYI:

I just found a guy selling Mahle Forged P/C sets brand new for cheap.  He's
trying to get a business started.  Check out these prices:

158.43a non-stroker
159.75bstroker  fob B.P. 98606
They are brand NEW and I sell bearings also.
I buy wholesale and sell 5% over. I'm trying to open a shop here local and
get my web site up.  They are Mahle Forged.  Prices Change week to week
sometimes less sometimes more depends on market.

That's all I know.  Found him via ebay I believe while just surfing around.
