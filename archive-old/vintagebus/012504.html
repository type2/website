not sure if this helps you or not but:
I also have a '65 Kombi, Pearl White, L87. My seat covers are original, also
in tatters. Theyare what I would call a salt and pepper, rough vinyl, kind of
like a weave. As far as I know this material is no longer available anywhere.
(if someone knows different please let me know).
