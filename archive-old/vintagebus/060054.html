Subject: RE does your bus tow a trailer

Being the truck driver that I am, I just had to hook something on behind the
63 double cab. With some help from a few beer drinkers it was decided to get
a lightweight boat trailer and remodel it. I got a 2 axle trl ( with
brakes ) We cut away everything it didn't need, put some ramps on it to fit
the Ghia, built a really cool, custom reciever hitch. We took them both to
shows in Ennis, Tx. Memphis, Ok City &amp; Springfield, Mo. Went to Eureka
Springs several times.
Kinda like the chicken crossing the road, I proved I could, then got tired
of it. I still have the hitch and trailer.
Lemme know if you want to see a picture of this 'rig'

Oh, the car &amp; trailer weighed about 3100 lbs.
At that time I was running a 1641 sp with the 412 rp. Some of these hills
did require 1st gear.
