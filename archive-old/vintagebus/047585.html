The body isnt as much as a problem as the chassis and floor. 
 Actually the chassis is pretty shot.
This is why I wanted to lift the body off the chassis.
Apart from not having to rebuild the steering/suspension/brakes again.
I just thought that if the body went on, the body comes off.

terminalogy is confusing here.  There is no separate body and chassis on a
splitty.  All these bits are welded together into one piece.    Depending on
what is rusted..... how is the possible bus?  If the main frame rails are
rusted  thats bad.  The outriggers to the rockers, the jackpoints can be
replaced (and often need to be) ditto for holes in the front floors, or by the
cargo doors.   It all depends.     I drive my 61 around sometimes and it needs
a lot of rust and dent repair to make it nice, so it is just a 37 year old
ratty original bus.   Rockers so bad you can put your fingers through,
outriggers bad, holes in floor,  etc.  But the frame is solid, there is no
danger of it collapsing, unlike a couple really rusted buses I have seen, one
a 23 window driving along that flexed.   Scary.     Maybe get a catalog of
rust repair panels, a cleeper and slidide around under there finding the rust
holes and identifying what pieces are rotten.
