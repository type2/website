Subject: Bra

Hi,

Just wanted to let all you folks know that PLF delivered my bra last week 
and I used it on my trip. Nice product! Looks Great! Fits quite well. From a 
short distance you almost wouldn't know that the bra is on my bus. The color 
match on the vinyl is very good. I have blue white over velvet green. Washed 
the bus this morning. The bra cleaned up easily with Simple Green and water.

Chris
