&gt; hi group.
&gt; I have been reading the posts for about a month now.  I was lucky enough
&gt; to find a '56 double door panel van and am now in the tearing down
&gt; stage.  i have been filing all your thoughts and messages so that as my
&gt; problems come up, i have answers.
&gt; i am havng a problem with my '70 bay window, and was wondering if i
&gt; could ask about gas in the oil.....i've been smelling gas recently and i
&gt; changed the oil today...couldn't believe it....what would cause this? 
&gt; even as i was draining the oil, i just watched what appeared to be gas,
&gt; continue to drip out....any thoughts?
&gt; well thank you and i enjoy reading all your posts.
&gt; thanks,
&gt;
