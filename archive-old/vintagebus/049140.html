The Bus is finally completely painted inside and out!  1 year and 3 months.  All of the trinkets and tidbits have been painted as well.  I guess the only things that haven't been painted yet are the gas tank and engine tin.  Color sanding began yesterday, no reason the bus shouldn't be home by the end of next week.  We used Glasurit paint, that stuff is really nice.

On the interior update, I have finished both seat bases and both rear deck cabinets with 3 coats of clear satin finish exterior Varathane (due to the UV protectant), sanding between each coat.  I also refinished the insides of everything, seat bases and cabinets.  It's tough not to get a few slight runs when you have so many flat surfaces running both horizontally and vertically.  I decided to pay closest attention to the fronts of everything, and if I got a slight run on the inside or side of something, so be it.  Anything bad I sanded out and refinsihed.  I'll finish the closet and small cabinet next to the forward cargo door by mid next week.  Then the underside of the main table, bottoms of the seat cushion boards and all of the cabinet doors and misc. wood pieces.  There's a lot of wood in an SO-23!  And I still have to Varathane all of the panels and headliner!!!  Those should go pretty quick since they're virgin wood and flat.

Pics of the shell and cabinetry should be up by late next week.  Don't know where to post them, maybe I'll set up one of theose PhotoPoint (?) accounts.
