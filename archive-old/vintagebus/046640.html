&lt;&lt; Hi Volks,
 I am getting a little desperate here.  I need to pick up the '66 Deluxe
 in Toano, VA on Saturday and can't find any help to load the splittie on
 the trailer.  If anyone can spare some time on Saturday, I would
 appreciate it.  I was planning to arrive in Toano around 11:00 from
 Philly.  I know there are a few bussers in the Richmond and Newport News
 area, please lend a hand.  There is suppose to be a local BBQ place that
 is great, my treat!
