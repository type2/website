 Well,
 
 I finally got off my ass yesterday, and on a rainy Southern CA night
 went out and put on some upper rear shock mounts (thanks Brendan) on the
 rust bucket '67 Westy.  This bus is so rusty that the mounts had
 literally rotted off the frame.  After lots of noisy grinding, cutting
 and patching of frame rail holes (my neighbors must love me), I welded
 the mounts to the frame rail.  Not the cleanest welds I've ever made,
 but its tough to get the nozzle up in there let alone a welding helmet
 to see what you're doing.
 
 Question:  I've been running around for about two months sans rear
 shocks.  Would this have harmed anything in the tranny??  Everything is
 working fine, I'm just paranoid I guess.  Also, the rubber snubber
 mounts (the stud the rubber snubber screws onto) have also rotted away.
 Any danger in  running with out the snubbers in place?  I don't carry
 anything except the SO42 kit.
 
 Thanks.
 
 Steve

I think your bus is permanently FUBAR due to running around like that.

but seriously, I think it's okay.   Drove the 54 i used to have w/no front 
shocks (AWOL from DPPO) and one broken rear shock for about 600 plus miles 
before finding some replacements.    The snubbers on the rear axle tubes were 
added mid 64 I believe.   One peg was broken off on the tranny I used to have 
in my 65,   Don't know how much difference it makes.  Then again I could 
probably stand to get new shocks.   Just another little bit that works better 
or doesn't.   Guess I would feel better about hauling heavy loads with 
everything in place, a westy kit does add weight.  The rubber snubbers are 
evidently great as dog chew toys, I have seen replicas in various colours 
made for that purpose.  Available probably at your local doggy stuff store.  
Don't know if those ones are good for buses though.  DRove w/o rear shocks 
for a bit on a bus I had, cause one fell apart, so I took the other off to 
make it even.
