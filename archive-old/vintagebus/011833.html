Subject: Re: Type4 Oil coolers
Date: Sun, 11 Oct 1998 00:03:03 PDT



&gt;
&gt;I saw a few more references to type4 oil coolers and would like to
&gt;mention my experience with
&gt;doing this conversion.
&gt;
&gt;RESULTS:
&gt;I didn't actually notice mush difference in operating temp.  I was
&gt;running hot before and still am.
&gt;Clearly this isn't a cure-all for hot running.
&gt;
&gt;I'm not sure why the temp didn't change much.  Clearly the same volume
&gt;of air is flowing since I didn't
&gt;do anything with the fan itself but I did expect a drop in temperature
&gt;of maybe 10F.  I'm seeing maybe one
&gt;or two, max.
&gt;

Maybe I am answering this too late, I read my mail in bulk, but I had to 
add...

I use a regular doghouse cooler. My 63 runs at 200 to 210 in 90 to 100 
degree weather at 65 MPH, fully loaded and has a pop top. It seems to me 
if your bus is running hot then there is another problem. Is your engine 
bigger then a 1600? Mine is a 1600 single port. 
I would check for seals around the cooler, and I would check the the 
cooler is in good shape. I have had bad coolers in the past that just 
didn't work. Many years of gummy oil and engine bits can foul it up no 
matter how well cleaned out.
