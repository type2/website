I had a set of used Bus Boy Safari Windows that I picked up for $50
complete. I had posted on the list that I was looking for installation
instructions for them. A list member helped me out. But Bus Boys also
emailed me and sent me the instructions. Very helpfull and friendly about
the whole thing. I'll do some business with them in the future as a result.
