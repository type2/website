I'll post a short trip report later, but I thought I'd mention this under a
separate heading to facilitate the finding of it later via the archives.
Here and there someone asks me or the lists about camper rentals in Europe.
Evon, Haley, and I just returned from a month-long trip through Europe in a
rented VW camper, and were very happy with the company we used, so I thought
I'd pass it on.

The company, based near Amsterdam, is Campanje, run by the husband and wife
team of Gerard and Tendayi van Spanje.  Gerard buys watercooled VW vans and
converts them to campers himself.  (Sorry, airheads, I don't know of a
company doing the same with aircooled vans in Europe.)  Most are what we
would call Vanagons, although the one we rented was his only Eurovan (called
a T4 in Europe).  Some are gasoline, others diesel.

The campers use a variety of German made aftermarket poptops.  Ours had a
Westfalia-like poptop, except that it lifted up with the aid of two very
large gas-filled struts (making it very easy to open, but somewhat difficult
to close).  Other campers Gerard has converted use an unusual poptop that is
taller, sort of like a cross between an Adventure Wagen raised-roof camper
and a Westfalia, such that there is a raised roof all the time for storage
up top, but it also pops up if you want to sleep up top.  The interior
layout is much like a Vanagon or Eurovan Westy, with a 3-way fridge, sink,
2-burner stove, and swiveling passenger seat.  The fit and finish are not of
the same caliber as a Westy (i.e. no carpeting, thinner foam padding on the
mattress, etc.) but were more then adequate considering the extremely low
price of the rental.  The collapsable table is freestanding, so it can be
placed in front of the sofabed, or put outside if you prefer to eat under
the stars.  A dual battery setup is standard, and an optional awning is
available for some of the campers.  The van we rented had a 2.4 liter diesel
engine, which got about 30 miles per gallon (quite a plus considering the
cost of gas in Europe), and a 5-speed transaxle.  It performed flawlessly
during the entire month.

Gerard met us at the airport and drove us back to his home, where he works
on the campers.  After a couple of hours of talking and drinking coffee, he
took us out, showed us how everything worked, offered us travel books from
his lending library (take what you need, leave behind any books you no
longer need when you go home for future renters), and gave us free road
service cards and repair vouchers in the event of problems.  We signed a
simple contract, and then followed him to the local campgrounds where we
checked in to fend off the jet lag.  Overall, the quality of service
couldn't have been better.

The cost?  Off season, it was about $350 a week for four weeks, plus a $1200
security deposit (to be refunded upon return of the camper in good
condition).  This included unlimited mileage, auto insurance, road service
club membership, VAT, etc.  You couldn't rent a car for that price, much
less a fully loaded camper!  The rate is a bit higher during peak season,
but still quite reasonable.

As an aside, the Netherlands is a very tourist-friendly place to begin a
European vacation.  People are generally friendly to tourists, almost
everyone speaks English, the dollar is worth something there, and it's
fairly centrally located.

Campanje's website is at http://194.109.6.92/~campanje/, and their e-mail
address is campanje_at_xs4all.nl.

As usual, the standard disclaimers apply.  I am not affiliated with Campanje
in any way, and your mileage may vary.  I know we'll be using them again.
