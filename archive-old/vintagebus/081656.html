Subject: RE: Bus Depot Clearance Sale -UPDATE

The last batch of items has now been added to this year's Online Garage
Sale.  I have also reduced prices even further on some of the remaining
items. There is lots of Bus stuff there, plus other aircooled (Bug, Ghia,
etc.). After we sell another 15 to 20 items I will end the sale, so check it
out now if you haven't already.

&gt; We did some spring cleaning this week, and found a lot of accumulated
&gt; NOS parts, one-of-a-kinds, customer returns, etc. that have been
&gt; gathering dust. So I've decided to run our first-ever online Bus Depot
Garage Sale.
&gt;
&gt; Everything in the Garage Sale is below cost - typically 50 to 80
&gt; percent off - and most is brand new. There's something for almost
&gt; every VW, from Busses, Vanagons, and Eurovans to Beetles, Type 3's,
&gt; and Golfs.
