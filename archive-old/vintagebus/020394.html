After more than two months of searching I found a suitable bus to buy; a 1963 
Riviera. The bus has 69,000 original miles and is supposedly in excellent 
original condition including original engine. I am buying the bus from David 
Ireland in Salt Lake City Utah; anybody know him or know of him? 

My plan is to fly out there this Sunday July 1st and drive it back home to 
Wisconsin over a 2.5 day period. I have joined the AIRS and emailed some 
members along my intended route. The replies have been outstanding, what a 
great community to be a part of. 

It has been recommended that I take along an extra fan belt; any other things 
to watch out for? The bus will have recieved a tune-up prior to departcher. 

Thanks everyone,
