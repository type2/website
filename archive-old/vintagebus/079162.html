Subject: 1975 Fleetline pics

Hey Volks

In Johannesburg today we had the annual Angela's Picnic old
car meeting. I took some pics of the cleanest and most
original Fleetline Kombi I have yet come across.

Check it out at:
http://66.34.72.138/cgi-bin/gallery-search.cgi?string=fleetline
Or search thesamba_dot_com gallery for the keyword &quot;fleetline&quot;.

I've been making a point of photographing Fleetlines
recently and there are now some good pics of them on
vintagebus_dot_com and thesamba_dot_com galleries, for those who are
interested in these oddball Brazilian/South African
throwback splitties.
