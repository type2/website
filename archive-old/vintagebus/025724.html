Subject: Tallahassee FL US cookout/meet Sat 7/17

Tallahassee Vintage Volkswagens will have a cookout and parts hunt this
Saturday, 7/17.  Come if you can.  Steve Reecy has given me permission
to forward his directions and descriptions (edited, below), so I'll let
him speak:

--BEGIN FORWARDED MESSAGE--

I talked with JB's of Just Bugs Restorations in Monticello.  He has
graciously allowed us to meet with him at his place at 4 PM on
Saturday.  He has a complete Air Cooled VW repair facility and bodyshop,
and lots of old VW parts cars including Ovals and Splitty Buses.  He
will sell parts too.

So, the itinerary is the following:

Meet at my house at 11 AM on Saturday.  Wear shorts and comfy clothing.
(volleyball clothes!) We'll then go up to the park near my house, light
the grill, let the kids play at the playground, drink beer, and talk
about old VWs.  After lunch, we'll play some volleyball.  We'll also get
to meet Timmy, and possibly David from Bug Junction and see each others
cars.  The parking is conveniently next to the sheltered picnic table.

By 3 PM, those that are interested can take a ride out to Monticello and
visit JB's.  You won't be disappointed!  I understand the my wife and
Brian's wife will be going out shopping.  They are widows of VW nuts. 
So, if the significant others want to tag along with the gals, they can.

The JB expedition will only last an hour or so at his shop, so we'll be
back in Tallahassee by 6 PM.  Incidently, Monticello is on the way back
to Gainesville and Orlando, so if you're itching to go back home by
dark, you might just make it.  

So, those are the plans.  I promise you a good time.  If anyone has
something they would like to offer in the way of entertainment, a
boombox, chairs, let me know.  I'll provide the food and the beer
cooler.

Drive your VW if you can so we can line them all up.  I think I can limp
mine the 4 blocks if I can get a pushstart for the ride back home. :0

Directions: 

My number is 893-2007.  To get to my house, go to the intersection of
Centerville road and Capital Circle Northeast (look in the phone book
for a map).  From there, go east, away from the center of town on
Centerville road.  Keep driving east on centerville road until you cross
a bridge that goes over Interstate 10 (can't miss it).  The bridge is
approx. 5 miles
&gt;from the intersection of Centerville and Capital Circle.  After the
bridge, you'll be going up a hill.  You'll see a neighborhood on the
left...keep going.  Then you'll start going downhill.  At the bottom of
the hill is a small country church.  Just beyond that, on the left side
is GARDENVIEW.  There is a turn lane to aid you in turning onto
Gardenview
&gt;from Centerville.  Once you're on Gardenview, take the first left,
WHITTINGTON.  Once on Whittington, my house is sixth (or so) on the
left. My address is 2839 Whittington.  Just look for the VWs.

Y'all come!
