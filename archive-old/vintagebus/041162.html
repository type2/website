Yeah, I have funky steering too. I put most of the blame on my swing
lever bushings, the pin is loose in there like a ... So I bought a pin
and bushings kit, but...

1) Muir says I can get them reamed together by a machine shop and then
hammer them in myself, maybe touching them up with a brake cylinder
hone.

2) VW (via Bentley) says I should pull the whole front end and get to
work using only VW special tool this that and the other one. I don't
see a speck of dirt on those lab coats so I don't believe they pulled
a greasy front beam at all. Just happened to have another one right
here with all bushings changed... Kinda like a TV cooking show, huh?
Yeah, right.

3) Local bug shop says they have to do it for me and it will cost
about $165. Something about the right sized reamer being hard to get
hold of. They just jack up the front and work on the beam in place.

I like Muir's answer best, but what do you volks think?

Thanks,
Joel
