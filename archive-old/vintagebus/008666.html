Finally!  I was beginning to wonder when something would happen, so it is
good that it happened when I'm not depending on it....it's a question I have
for you, because I am not yet convinced that the tranny in my '66 is
dead.....it may be the clutch, but if I am going to pull the engine to fix a
clutch, and the problem doesn't go away, I'll be mad that I didn't yank the
tranny and have Mr. Long of Long Enterprises in Sebastopol rebuild
it.....you know what I mean!

So here's what's happening:  The PO told me that it has given him severe
problems getting into first and second gear.  I drove it, and for several
days, I found it hard at times, but never impossible, to shift down.....but
now I have had several instances of being stopped and not being able to get
into gear at all!  I had changed the oil yesterday, and the level (which I
checked again today) is fine.  Yes, I was messing around with the shift
linkage too, but I don't think that that has anything to do with it.  I can
feel all four (+rev) gears when the engine is stopped....shifting is easy.
So I jumped out of the bus and adjusted the clutch to negative freeplay, and
in fact it slipped under normal acceleration, but the problem did not go
away.

The weird thing is this:  When I do manage to get it into gear, it feels
like the clutch is still partially engaged;  the bus creeps, the engine dogs
down, and ugly noises ensue (some of them from me).  Once in motion, the
shifting is almost normal, (I do rpm matching to the best of my ability
anyway), but there is still some feeling that the clutch isn't disengaging
the tranny from the engine.....  Has anyone else ever felt this?
Is it possible that my clutch/throwout bearing have some kind of latch on
the input shaft?  There is something unnatural going on when the bus is in
neutral and I push in the clutch....T/O?
BTW the howling I was hearing before I changed the tranny oil (85-90 wt
GL-4) has lessened.

Thanks for getting this far!

Gene
