Subject: Re: [VB] The Bus Depot's &quot;economy brake parts&quot; anyone tried 'em

I've used the &quot; BD economy parts&quot; on my Vanagon.  I did receive one 
rear wheel cylinder  that was not drilled for a bleeder?  Bus Depot 
exchanged it promptly with no problem. That was about 2 years ago and I 
haven't had any problems since.  I've purchased the &quot;economy&quot; ones for my 63 
as well, but I haven't driven it much yet.  Overall, I have been very 
pleased with the price and quality.  Bus Depot will stand behind what 
they sell.

results...?
