Subject: help: unusual intermittent electrical seeming problem
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.A41.3.96.1000815133732.52678H-100000_at_pdx444.pdx.intel_dot_com&gt;


Details:

New motor(1600 SP) with ~500 miles on it. I pulled the motor last weekend
to do any number of things (new oil pump cover gasket, plug tin holes,
remove shim from fan, etc.). After re-installing the motor everything ran
great for a few days. Then the bus died on me, in a very electrical system
type way. I quickly discovered the problem. My coil had slipped and the
positive side was grounding out against my oil filter. I pushed the coil
back into position, and everything seemed to be running fine.

My problem:

The motor occasionally misfires now. It seems to occur when
the motor is under load, but is intermittent. It never occurs in 1st and
2nd gear, it ususally seems to happen at low revs in 3rd.

My question:

Does this sound like something that could be caused by the coil getting
grounded out? Is my coil hosed? Did it do some damage to my pertronix
ignitor? Where is the best place to start debugging this?

All help is greatly appreciated
