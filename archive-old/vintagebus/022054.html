Subject: Transaxle Saga Comes to an End
To: VintageBus_at_type2_dot_com

After months, the saga comes to an end.  I got it all back together properly 
and intalled last night.  Took it on a 60 mile voyage and everything is nice 
and smooth.
Again thanks to Ronnie and Sam at Rancho as well as everyone on the list who 
helped me out.

Next stop is body work, as soon as the holidays are over.
