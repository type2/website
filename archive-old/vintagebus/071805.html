Subject: Re: [VB] &quot;economy brake parts&quot; 

I haven't used India wheel cylinders, but used brasialian just fine.   some 
say the German are better, well they certainly cost twice as much.  I get the 
brasialian if I can.   Any brand can have it's oopses.   Friend of mine bought 
all new German wheel cylinders on her (70?) bus, and voila there was some 
leak.  unfortunately she got the oopsy cylinder.   was a bit pissed after being 
persuaded to buy German as &quot;it's so much better&quot;, then having to redo the job.

Always take the wheel cylinders apart and look inside before installing.   I 
do.  Once I was getting an NOS brakes part and idly did that while chatting to 
the guy at the shop, and one of the pistons was missing.  Out of a previously 
unopened VW box.  guess Karl at the factory had too much beer and shnapps the 
night before.  

I once almost bought an Indian wheel cylinder years ago, but was taking it 
apart at the counter and the ID was different than stock so I got the 
brasialian.   Hey Ron, did you check the piston size on those was same as stock?

Sorry, Ron, but the first thing I do when I get a bus,
is the brakes, and I ALWAYS buy the best available. 
There is NO excuse for settling for less than the best
when it comes to the safety of me and mine (and the
other guy).  I'm sorry, but brakes are the one system
that I refuse to compromise on, and I don't want to be
on the same road with those that do!
