Got two boxes that handle the lighting. The high beam/low beams are handled
by a smaller chingadera that lives over under the fusebox. It is a latching
relay that swaps the outputs each time it is triggered. Slick little doodad.
The other'n is the magic box, it couples your front and rear signals all
together for flasher time, and leaves them separate for things like brake
lights. Different units, so I would first suspect your turnsignal switch is
not having that fresh feeling as it is involved both times. Testing the
headlight dipping relay is fairly easy, figure out which terminal is the
signal (it comes from the turnsignal switch), and hit it with a hot jumper
wire while the lights are on. If it dips the headlights back and forth it is
good, and they usually are unless they were the victim of an incomplete 12
volt conversion. Finicky tail and turn lights can be lots of things, grounds
being bad, cruddy contacts, etc., all possibilities. Check it out and let us
know.

&gt; It's time to replace the dammit box that controls all functions relating
&gt; to lighting.  First my high beams wouldn't go off.  Then I had no
&gt; lights.  Finally after much clicking of the switch I was able to get low
&gt; beams and left it at that.  Turn signals are getting crusty so it's
&gt; time.  Who has/where can I find the DIY schematics using mortal relays?
