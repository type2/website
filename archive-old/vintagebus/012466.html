Yup.  I was the same way.  And I'm slow; it took me a while to
realize what was happening, in addition to paying *way* too much
for stuff.  I also wonder how many people are out there shilling.
Now I get peeved when newbies bid stuff up on the first day,
like that notchcrewguy from chico - dave heard?

As more of the heavy hitters are moving in, it's going to get
more interesting.  And some of the prices; someone paid $50-something
for a set of engine lid hinges!  Oye!  

With some of the stuff going up on ebay, I wonder if anythign will
show up at the swap meets!  Or will we see higher prices at the swaps,
with the seller saying &quot;sorry, I can get $x on ebay!&quot;

Now I wait for the last second to bid.  I think people were shadowing
me as well, looking for stuff I bid on, then out bidding me.  Since
I started waiting until the last second, I dont' see some of the same
people bidding on the same stuff I do.  They have to do their own
detective work now.

The way the auction should work is that no amounts are posted until
the end of the auction.  You can bid as many times as you want, but
nobody knows who's the high bidder and how much.  Then you'd really
need to put in a good bid, and there'd be no point to waiting until
the last minute.  Maybe I should start my own site...

&gt; Boy I used to get so burned up when I first started bidding on eBay when someone would snip me.  It royally sucked.  Then I realized that more often than not a lot of people were doing it, and didn't feel like they were doing anything wrong.  I finally decided, &quot;if I can't beat 'em, join 'em!&quot;
