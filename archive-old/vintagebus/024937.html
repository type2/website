Hi Scott,
The flaps if you have a fresh air system are inside the lowest part of the 
fan shroud.  you really need to buy the Bentley reprint of the VW bus shop 
manual for 1963-67 or at the least a 1968 on up type 1 or 2 Bentley service 
manual for really good info on 1600 SP and DP engines.  Both have lots and 
lots of nice pictures to show you what should be there and how it goes 
together.   Eric&amp;Barb
