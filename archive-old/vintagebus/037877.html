Subject: Oil leaking
Date: Mon, 29 May 2000 10:22:32 +0700

Dear volks,
a couple months ago I had problem with my 1600 air cooled engine which
installed in my 74 bus, lube oil had leaked / dropped from behind of
crankshaft pulley.  Today I had overhauled this engine I didn't found
something wrong inside engine.
1. Oil deflector in a good condition and placed at the right place
2. Pulley groove ( Originally VW ) good condition, no scratch and galling.
Pulley clearance into engine block is 0.05 mm each side
3. End float of crankshaft is 1.2 mm ( too big and I will re set up by shim
)
4. Lube oil dropping line from oil deflector case into oil bath in a good
condition ( not plugging )
Did anyone had experience with lube oil leaked like me ?, please advice me

Regards,
Thomas Agus BP
