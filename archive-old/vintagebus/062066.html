Subject: 46mm to 36mm RGBs?  Plus random tranny ?s

This is kind of an odd question, but is it easy to switch from big nut 46mm
RGBs to small nut 36mm RGBs?

I imagine the same swing axles and all that can be used and the RGB bodies
just flip flop with each other.  Hopefully this is all that is necessary.

... Long story why I would be interested in the smaller RGBs, but I lay
complete blame on Thomas Ainley :)   (not going to steal his thunder on what
he has been working on).

Is anyone running a Camber Compensator on their swing-axle trannys?  Anyone
have some recommendations?  I know a few different designs exist for
basically the same thing.

What exactly is considered a &quot;freeway flier&quot;?  In the past I have seen
debate over the term and not sure what 4th gear people define as a freeway
flier anymore.  Also is there a way to modify 2nd or 3rd a bit higher while
doing the tranny?  I would hate to just plop a higher 4th and then have a
huge gap in power on the 3-to-4 shift.  

Someone was also saying that the tranny is pretty easy to work on at home...
Any opinions on that?  Or good webpages that illustrate the DIY suffering
with a swing-axle tranny :)

A lot is covered here, so sorry for the magnitude of material.  Any input
would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Adrian S. Pillow
