hey all,
just got to work... i'm posting this so hopefully i can get an answer
before i get home tonite and do some brake work. the question i have
is what size is that castle nut on the rear axle? i am borrowing an
impact wrench and need to get a socket. i was thinking 40mm. is that
close? thanks in advance!!
