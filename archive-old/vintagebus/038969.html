&gt; Most Japanese motor cycles have small lights in their instrument
&gt; clusters. These lights are usually a rubber encased setup into
&gt; which you insert a small 12 volt bulb. The rubber casing
&gt; presses up into the instrument and is very easy to remove. Normally
&gt; there are two wires coming from the rubber casing. Obtain one of
&gt; these lights from a motorcycle wrecker, or your old disused Jap rat
&gt; bike if you have one, attach an alligator clip to the end of each
&gt; of the wires and you have your static timing light.

That's clever, but I made a static timing light virtually for free and
have had it for over 10 years with no problems.  Take an empty plastic
prescription pill bottle, drill a couple of holes in the lid, run wires
with alligator clips on the other ends through it and solder them to a
12V (or 6V, as appropriate) light bulb (e.g.  a spare backup-light
bulb).  The bottle is sturdy enough to protect the bulb, and an amber
one cuts the glare too. For once the child-proof cap is an advantage!
