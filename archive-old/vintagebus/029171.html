&gt; Hi Greg,
&gt; Actually it is what was use for a Riviera.  Thier tents in the 1960s had a
&gt; rope sewn in the edge that slipped into this channel to lock it in there.
&gt; Sundial does not have a rope sewn in thier edges and uses little brackets
&gt; bolted to the roof that in turn are bolted to the tent frame.  So we remember
&gt; this fact by Riviera = rope!   Eric&amp;Barb

The &quot;big top&quot; tents also used this railing set up.  They were used with late
64-early 67 SO-42 campers.  These are the tents that don't have a floor.  Jim
has this tent /railing and can speak of originality  BTW there are TWO pieces
because the front right leg of the wood slat Westy rack needed the space.  This
is the easiest way to tell that the railing is from a SO-42 Westy.


Steve
