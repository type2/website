Subject: re: seat covers
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com


Erik asked about seat cover sources. When I was
starting to work on my 65 double cab, none of the
catalogs listed seat covers for it, and the stuff they
showed for other buses was pretty generic (hey, this
was 1986 in Wisconsin), and I wasn't at all sure what
&quot;regular&quot; bus stuff worked in a double cab. 
So, I checked around with local upholstery shops and
people with nice work done on their cars, and had my
seats done by a local lady, picked a fabric that I
liked, and it cost less than &quot;generic&quot; bus seat covers
would have cost out of a catalog.  Of course, they
bear no resemblence to stock seat covers, but the&gt;
seats were lacking any fabric or cover when I got
them, so I did what I wanted.  Always figured I could
re-do them when I got rich.
 Today, with many more parts readily available through
parts dealers, it may be different, but it still
might be worth checking with shops that do the work on
a custom basis.
