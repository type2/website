further investigated rubber buffers on trucks- skip now if not interested

The 58 parts list I  have is dated april 58 in front  it only lists stamped 
bumpers.  

1956 list shows
261 829 575  (4) for side gates
261 829 577 for rear gate gummipuffer, with the picture implying they attach 
to the body

April1958 ed.   The 58 parts list I  have is dated april 58 in front  it only 
lists stamped bumpers.  is NOT updated to 59.
 list shows

261 829 575  (4) for side gates
261 829 577 for rear gate , with the picture implying they attach to the body
(same as 56- pic and # of part in list)

1963 ed list  (though updated through 67) has

261 829 575 rubber buffer 26x15 dropside -use 4
261 829 577 rubber buffer 28x24 dropside -use 4
261 829 577 rubber buffer 28x24  tailboard  - 2
261 829 577A   rubber buffer - tailboard(home market only)-2

which is exactly what my list that was updated through 70 (avalability, not 
model year) shows

in this pic the rear buffer location implies they are mounte on the taillboard

this implies a change at the  bumper change to me, though still ignore a 
buffer at the rear by the engine vents.

my  newly aquired1968 parts list  (w/updates through Nov 71, but I dont think 
this one covers past the 72 model year) shows 
261 829 577B  rubber buffer 28x28 -dropside to ch no. 211 2300 000 -use 8
261 829 577A  rubber buffer 30x40-dropside, from ch no 212 2000 001 - use 8

which gies the dimensions of the 577A used on the splitts, and also may 
explain where WW got the 40mm from (72 and on trucks, and splitty post 58 
'home market' ie euro taillgate bumpers.    
also using 8 implies the same one was used 2 per gate- thats 6, hm the two 
left over at the rear side on the body?   or for bay at the rear drop side on 
the body?  2 on the body in any case I am sure.

curiously, the splits use cheese head (phillips) machine screws for attaching 
them (with nuts on the non threaded holes) whil ethe bay book shows a slotted 
screw.

thought I had a 61 edition parts list somewhere, but ???

anyway,  seems to me that

through 58 
side gates got  261 829 575 rubber buffer 26x15 - 4- on the gates
taillgates used 261 829 577 rubber buffer 28x24  tailboard  - 2- on the body
 
59 on splitty
261 829 577 rubber buffer 28x24 dropside -use 4
261 829 577 rubber buffer 28x24  tailboard  - 2- on the taillboard or
261 829 577A  rubber buffer 30x40 tailboard-  for the euro version   ??? on 
body or tailboard

and at some point the side buffers were added?   62 or 63?  

thus originally a 63 US delivery SCwould not use any 40mm buffers.

also that WW and WCM can be useless, in terms of they just want to sell you 
something, rather than figure what was original, even though the WW guy 
dissed WCM for WCM selling incorrect parts.  

that said, any size bumper can be used.   This discussion is about 
Originality, not Use.  Sort of like &quot;will the real Velvet  Green please stand 
up&quot;.
