If you can do bodywork, you can do the wheel.  It is the same process.  Take
your time and be a perfectionist.  You'll be staring at it quite a bit!  Use the
epoxy...it will last longer.  Use quality primers, sealers, and top coats and
you will do as good if not a better  job than  Kotch.   Only you can decide if
the time + money equation works for you.

If you decide to do it you might want to get the book that eastwood sells.  It
has a few tips for piecing together really thrashed wheels.  Good luck.

&gt; &gt; catalog has a steering wheel restoration kit. Has anybody tried this? The
&gt; &gt; steering wheel has no missing pieces, but A LOT of cracks. It costs $60. Is
&gt; &gt; it worth a shot, or would it be better to pay to have it restored. It
&gt;
&gt; Eric and Barb love this kit. Like most things, it probably depends on
&gt; how much care you put into the job.
&gt; I have seen steering wheels done with bondo and spray paint and they
&gt; look pretty good. (Thom)
&gt;
&gt; Also, there is a very nice leather cover you can get for a bus steering
&gt; wheel from WCM, wheelskins brand, like on porsches. I have one, about
&gt; $30 retail I think, and it will cover a wheel very nicely until the koch
&gt; restoration is within reach.
