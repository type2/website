First of all, I am very new here.  I know nothing about SOTO or any other
VW club.  But I just spent several minutes reading and deleting some very
consistent complaints about SOTO.  (By the way, what does that stand for?)

What I do know about is non-profits.  I work with them, help organize them,
and sit on boards of directors.  They have to follow a set of fairly strict
rules to be non-profits.  Among these are:  There has to be at least one
business meeting per year for the general membership, and the membership
has to be notified of the meeting.  This meeting is where the election of
officers takes place.  This might be a good opportunity to raise questions,
and get lots of people to attend in hopes of influencing the election
results.  Some organizations have a provision in their bylaws to allow for
proxy or absentee votes.

Another requirement says that the minutes of all meetings are public.  Any
member is entitled to a copy.  You should be able to find out what
happened, etc.

Another requirement that seems to be on point is that there must be an
independent audit of finances; income and expenses.  This is also public,
and members should be able to get  a copy.  You could see where your money
is being spent.

Members should be able to get a copy of the bylaws and articles of
incorporation.  These will tell you what the rules of this club are, so you
can tell if they are being followed.

The nonprofit (SOTO) is incorporated under the laws of some state.  If you
do not get responses from the club, you can make complaints to the
appropriate state office.  They should also be able to provide copies of
articles of incorporation.

Many non-profits are also registered with the IRS as a 501(c) (3)
organization.  This makes the rules regarding reporting, audits, etc. even
tighter.  You can call your local IRs office and request a copy of the
club's annual report.  This may also be informative about how funds are
being spent.

If some of you are serious about challenging the current club officers some
of the above may help.  If the club is really being mismanaged as badly as
the messages seem to indicate most bylaws also include a provision for
removal of officers.

If you are just venting your frustrations, that is OK too.

I sure enjoy this group.  I have found an amazing amount of really useful
information, answers to a variety of questions etc.  None of these would
have been available to me living as I do in rural Utah, where many people
are suspicious that VWs were built by Nazis or Communists or something.  (I
wonder if Rush Limbaugh has an opinion on air cooled engines as a liberal
plot.  I'll ask some of my coworkers).
