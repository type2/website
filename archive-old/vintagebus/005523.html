I saw this commercial last week- This is very cool except for when the Honda
takes off and leaves the bus sitting there in the dust......It is still very
cool to see our treasures featured in the media...nice bumper stickers as
well.

&gt; Has anyone seen the Ad for a Honda electric car that features a VW
&gt; Microbus!?
&gt; I saw it only once a few days ago and haven't seen it since then.
&gt; The back of the bus is covered with decals that say thigs like...&quot;save the
&gt; whales&quot;,  &quot;arms are for hugging&quot; etc and the announcer says that you can
&gt; save the world by saying it on the back of your car or by driving ours.
&gt; Liked the commercial, liked the bus, didn't neccesarily like the honda!
