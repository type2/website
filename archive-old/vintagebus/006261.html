&gt; Is that possible?  I didn't look at it to see if the carbs were
&quot;flipable&quot;.
&gt; Your not yanking my chain to see if I would fall for the old &quot;Yea dude you
&gt; just gota flip the carb around&quot; trick are you?


No, I'm not joking Chuck.  If you think about it, flipping the carb around
would make the throttle shaft rotate the other direction.  Then the arm
would be pushing straight down on either side.  This is how my Weber's are.
I don't know how the Kadrons and their single barrel setups work but I can't
help but think that left carb need to be rotated 180 degrees.  How about the
rest of you - anyone running Berg linkage with dual Kads?
