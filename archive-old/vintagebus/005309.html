Sounds like I've heard that one before. People tend to think that since this
thing is more then 30 years old it should be given away for free. Right now
with the way I work on my bus I don't think it'll be worth &quot;just&quot; $5000.00
when I'm done. To me it'll be priceless. Another thing; Have you noticed
lately those stripped buses for sale? More and more people would make money
just selling off all the parts first and then just a shell alone. This way
they make a ton more money. Can you just imagine collecting all the goods
from all over the world to put it back together? I've got my '63 and so far
I have spent almost $700.00 buying bits and pieces that it was missing.

&gt; Ja; (*sigh*) if it were only $5000...
&gt;
&gt; But still, everyone is thinking at the $1500 level.  I get countless
&gt; emails from people along the lines of &quot;I'm a poor college student and
&gt; I really want a bus so I can tag along with the rest of the Phish
slackers.
&gt; I have $1500 and I want something with no rust and it has to run good
&gt; because I have no mechanical skillz. And it has to be one of the ones
&gt; with the big sunroof because those are so cool&quot;

&gt; &gt; Ya, just cause you dropped $5,000 into your bus does not mean you could
sell
&gt; &gt; it for that much.

&gt; &gt;  &gt; Thats stoopid, some folks would rather pay $1100 for a rust bucket
rather
&gt; &gt;  &gt; than kick down the extra $400 for a solid bus. unless you enjoy metal
work
&gt; &gt;  &gt; and already have the bits it just doesnt make since.
