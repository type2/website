&lt;&lt;i've got a pair of side gates for a singlecab that i pulled out of a heap 
of stuff destined for the junkyard.  i'm willing to give them to anyone who 
thinks they can use them.  they are pretty bad but i think salvageable.  the 
hinges are rusted away and there are good sized holes along the length of the 
bottoms of both gates.  i'll be at jerome and would be glad to drive them out 
to someone who wants them.  pictures are at:

the pictures aren't as close up as i'd have liked but then we're still 
learning this digital camera thing.  i did have success with &quot;enlarge the 
canvas&quot; and &quot;zoom in&quot; when the files were on my hard drive.
