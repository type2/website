Subject: Re: [VB] Cargo door handle

door keys changed over the years

there was one style through 53 
next 54 through 63
the T series 64 - 66
L series 67 through ?70?

each time the key was changed the size and shape of the lock cylkinder was 
also changed.  so no you cannot take a lock cylinder out of a 62 style handle 
and swap it into a 66 handle. Cylinders I think are also different depending 
on which handle they go into.

There was a cosmetic change in the cargo handle when they went to the indent 
in the cargo door in 59.   Also panel van handles are shorter- no inside 
handle was used.  The engine lid locks are often a differnt later sseries of 
key, though you may have the L series.

&lt;&lt; &gt; We do not know if the later tumbler will fit at all, but if you want the

work. 
 &gt; The earlier used pins going only one way where the &quot;T&quot; and later keys have 
 &gt; pins going two ways to make it much more difficult to pick the lock.  
 &gt; Fortunitly the later E handle is probably the easiest to find of the 
pre-1968 
 &gt; bus handles.
 
 Thanks for the reply.  Are 66 and 67 keys different?  My drivers door and 
engine lid lock are different to the other locks - slightly longer keys and 
appear to be VW but aren't the cutout VW sign.
 Would a barrel from a 66 lock fit in a 67 door handle?  I have got a NOS 
engine lid lock on the way so the only bad handle is the cargo handle, and 
the lock on the drivers door is of a different style but I think must of been 
NOS when it was fitted 6 years ago.
 
 Thanks
 Paul
