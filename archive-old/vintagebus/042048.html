&gt; Hey Derrick,
&gt; 
&gt; Loosen up the little screw on the points and postion the points against the 
&gt; distributor shaft at the lobe w/ your .016 feeler guage in place.  You want 
&gt; that gap setting to hold while the lobe it pushing on it.  After the points 
&gt; are good and screwed spin your motor and make sure they open and close and 
&gt; have the proper gap.

And after you finish this, get a dwell meter and adjust the points to the
correct dwell specification.  Even with new points, I've never been able
to get the correct dwell by adjusting the point gap.
