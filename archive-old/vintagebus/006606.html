Subject: [VB] Shorty Bus is Home (Part 3).


The shorty bus is home. As I write this, shorty is still on the trailer that
brought her home, and the snow is building on her roof as she spends her
second day in fifteen years outdoors.
Saturday, Mike and I hooked up his trailer and went over to resurrect shorty
from his charter bus barn tomb. When we got there, Arnold had just pulled up
and was unlocking the door. The building shorty was parked in shares a large
parking lot with an automotive garage and there was a construction crew
working next door using a hydraulic generator and pump to saw holes through
concrete blocks to install a new window.  Real he-man construction stuff.
Just as I figured, Arnold had gone to no effort to clear stuff away from
Shorty, and Mike and I busily dug in and moved pallets, cardboard boxes and
various interior features of charter buses out of the way. I wish I had
thought to bring the camera, but I didn't.
We had to find a step ladder and clean off seat frames and tables from the
top of my new treasure, but with the three of us working we had the junk
cleared off within ten minutes.
We put a floor jack underneath the beam and swung the front end around, then
Mike and I tried to push the bus away from the wall. No luck, the front
wheels were frozen and all four tires were near flat.
With Arnold steering, Mike and I got in back and put our shoulders into
pushing the bus. A couple of shoves and pretty soon the front wheels broke
free.
The shop where the bus was parked has an air compressor so we were able to
get three tires up without repair, but the passenger side rear, which is the
one right behind the passenger door, was twisted out of shape from the
pushing and twisting to move the bus. We took that tire off, and went down
to one of the local run tire shops where they took it off the wheel and hung
it on the door of the shop heater to soften up. After we had a couple  cups
of coffee and stared at the shop's impressive collection of &quot;hot babe tool
calendars&quot; for awhile, the tire had softened up enough to be remounted.
The garage owner was able to seal the bead and the tire held air. We took it
back to the shop and bolted the tire back up to shorty.
Pretty lucky after all these years to have all four tires up and holding, at
least long enough to get the bus on a trailer.
As Arnold opened the big door and Shorty was rolled into the sunlight, the
construction guys went nuts. &quot;What the hell is that?&quot; along with the usual
laughs and hoots construction guys are known for.
One guy suggested we stroke the sides of it to see if it would get longer...
but after the initial amazement, they all came over to take a look at
shorty. The crew had a small John Deere there with a front loader and they
brought it over to pull shorty on the trailer. We hooked a chain to the beam
and the bucket of the Deere and shorty rolled right up. I've driven buses up
on to a trailer before but I've never had one where all four wheels were on
the ramps at the same time.
Since I live in a small town, we passed a lot of people that either Mike or
I know coming home with shorty on the trailer. Comments we encountered from
passers-by during the trip  included &quot;Death-trap&quot;, &quot;Clown car&quot;,and &quot;Optical
Illusion&quot;, but the best one of all came from one of my friends at a stop
light who leaned out his truck window and said, &quot;Damn, John, how much did
you have to give for that thing?&quot; I just smiled and said,
&quot;I gave the guy 3 for it&quot;. Then the light changed and we rolled on our way.
