    This is on what appears to be a '64 Standard Microbus w/ sunroof (no
roof skylights).  DPO has installed a '74-'79 pop-top roof with highly
modified front luggage rack (cut it down so it is only 6&quot;-8&quot; on the
inside front to back).  Also installed is a fairly clean camper interior
(non-westfalia)...

a 221 is a standard micro, the sunroof version is 28 something.
