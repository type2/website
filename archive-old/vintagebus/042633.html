well,

i felt the need to chime in here...

If one buys land with restrictions on it from a private association then
you must abide by those restrictions.  You took your chances when you
bought in there, and it is your duty to abide by those restrictions, or
face whatever consequences you signed on for.

i/e if you live in a neighborhood with rules, abide by the rules or find a
different neighborhood.

If, on the other hand, you bought land with no restrictions and
restrictions are later placed on it by the state, i feel that is wrong and
one should do everything in ones power to subvert and change those laws.

IMHO, even if an agglomeration of steel has a vin and was once a car,
once it is on my property i can call it whatever i want to call it and
thats my business.  I cant even fathom why we have let the DMV/Government
tell us what shape metal on our property must take.  I can see their point
when its on the road, but once its not they really shouldnt have a say.

what the state is saying is: if its a steel sculpture/lawnchair etc. its
okay, if it has a vin then its subject to towing just seems wrong.  What i
find pleasing to put in my yard, and what the government finds pleasing in
my yard are two different things in this case.  What it really comes down
to is legislating taste and aesthetics... which makes me sick. (but we are
still better off than most third world countries, so i think i'll stay
here and fight for change rather than moving to ???)

from now on all my cars are art and i am expressing my constitutionally
protected speech through yard sculpture :) (thanks to whomever posted that
loophole.)

peas,

Steve

p.s. i dont have a yard yet, but am shopping for land with no
restrictions.  Currently since i reside in an area with restrictions i
have leased a warehouse.

p.p.s. if the price of your land is brought down by proximity to old cars,
you probably paid too much.
