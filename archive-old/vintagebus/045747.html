Subject: Two L 360 Sea Blue colors !!!
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I looked in my old  1967 Ditzler paint chip book today

there are Two  L360 Sea Blue paints

the darker one is 12333 Sea Blue    1960-66
the lighter one is 12945 Sea Blue #2   63-67

both are L360

I am not sure if one was for a bug/ghia and the other for buses or ???

looked at a 21 window today  and it still had the tags on it
L360 Sea Blue
L680 Cumulus white

I hope all this adds to the confusion , because other then taking a original 
part off the car I am not sure which is the right color ?????
