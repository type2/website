To: buslist &lt;vintagebus_at_lenti.type2_dot_com&gt;

It amazes me that Drew Colome's '66 Camper has not
sold as of yet! I parked right next to it at the OCTO
and briefly checked it out. From what I saw it is a
pretty nice bus. If you are looking for an excellent
daily driver or occassional camper beastie then you
ought to give this one more attention. See photos on
VWPlanet or call Drew at the number below. The only
complaint with Drew on this bus is that he would not
trade the rack on my bus for the one on his bus. =)
