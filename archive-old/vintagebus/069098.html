Just a brief question to those of you going to Bad Camberg regarding
traveling overseas during this upcoming time of war/uncertainty.

The very nervous SO is starting to freak so I need some good calming
your nerves type responses to traveling over &quot;there&quot;.  Now, I don't have
any qualms regarding the safety of traveling even if we are at war, but
she does.  Any suggestions to what I might say to help calm her down?

I'm going to check the US embassy's web site for travel recommendations
as well as some other _dot_gov sites.  Suggestions?  How about travel
insurance?  Are people getting that?  Is it void in times of war?

Thanks!

Steve
