The rating point of &quot;continuous operation&quot; is generally
taken as &quot;normal operation&quot;, not drag racing;&lt;) The point
is, if you need to run more than 5,000 rpm in the normal
operation of you engine, a stock crank will not work. Up to
that point, a stock crank can handle 5,000 rpm.

Berg lists a 5,400 and a 5,800 rpm cut out rotor. They
recommend the 5,800 rpm unit for the T2 because of the lower
gearing.

&gt; This is a useful data point.  However, most hotrodders care about
&gt; quarter-mile performance, not longevity.
