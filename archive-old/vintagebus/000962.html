Hello Everyone!

	I have a Transmission question? I recently replaced my engine (1600DP) and
noticed that my trans boots were badly needing replacement. They were torn
and had probably been that way for a long time I went down to the my local
mechanic and bought some new ones. I didn't think at the time to check the
transmission fluid to see if it was low but it was. I have driven the bus
around for about 300 miles now most locally. But when I took it out of town
about 20 miles or so when I got to a stop I couldn't get it into gear. When
I went to a local shop today to have them check the trans fluid it was
almost empty. I had him top it off but it probably didn't have any fluid
left in there. 1) Has anyone had this problem not being able to shift with
low transmission fluid and 2 do you think that the transmission has been
damaged because of  a low fluid level.
