Clara, I salute you.
I am now on my 58th VW.
I NEVER drive on freeway.
I trailer them to shows.
I will sometimes drive three or four blocks before getting
back in the garage.
Folks actually drive their VWs?
Maybe I live in the wrong place.
Go to work, 18 miles freeway, go 75 to 80 mph or get run over.
VW won't do this:(
Weekends, Tijuana, Bad roads, playing bumper cars. to change lanes
you must push car in lane you selected out of the way.
VW won't do this:(
Come back to Sandy Eggo, wait at border, up to 2 hours idling.
VW won't do this:(

I love VWs!!!  I want to go 75 mph, NEVER, EVER run hot...
Idle for hours and not run hot.  This is what I want.
My bus goes 8 blocks before vapor locking and I must wait
for her to cool down for an hour to go another 8 blocks.
I love the thing.  It just isn't drivable.
I have it to wash and polish.  I also enjoy looking for all
the 15 window Deluxe parts that are missing.
Someday I will have a complete 1962 15 window Deluxe to look at.
But, to actually drive it somewhere?  No way.
It will get stolen, vandalized, scratched, dented, broken into,
If someone was to break one of my corner windows I would go bankrupt.
I love my bus.  Talk to it before and after work.  Sit in her for hours
making lists of what is missing or not correct for 1962.
Wife says I love the bus more than her.  Scared me 'cause I really had to
think about it before saying &quot;Oh, no baby I love you more&quot;...
Maybe I'll just change the engine.
I have tried carb, dist, timing, valves, everything.
Fan is good nothing in the way of airflow.
I got a 1600dp with doghouse.  nothing clogged in cooler.
Little fan shroud flappies are gone.  We want no air restriction here.
Maybe if I moved to Alaska again.  I could actually drive a VW there.
Well, I just wanted to salute all of you who can drive their VWs!!!
Chris in Sandy Eggo...
'62 Type 113.  runs hot...
'62 Type 251.  runs hot...
'91 Mercedes 300SD  Go anywhere and run cool...
