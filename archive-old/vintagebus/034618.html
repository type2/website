&lt;&lt; hey guys does anyone know where to get a good substitute for the inner
 plastic liner on early taillights ???? &gt;&gt;
Hi John,
If you mean for the 1955-57 bus tail lights.  If the plastic liner (Filter) 
is missing unless you are making a show bus then just leave them out for 
brighter tail lights.  VW did the same with the bug 1956-61 tail lights and 
taking out the plastic filter makes a huge differance in brightness.  Though 
you still have the built in reflector in the lense problem to plague you at 
night.  Apparently from what we have been able to find out so far VW did not 
install these plastic filters in Canadian or Euro bug taillights, but had to 
due to legal pressures in the law books in the USA market caused by USA 
automobile manufactures trying to squeeze out VW by hook or crook.  Eric&amp;Barb
