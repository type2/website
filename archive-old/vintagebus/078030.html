Subject: RE: [VB] King Pin rebuild help is needed...

Funny that we're all tools though isn't it?

(although 'tool' may be an australianism - now I think
about it I can't ever remember hearing the term used in the US.
My wife often accuses me of being a tool 8-)))))))

Have a good one all

RobK

----------------------
As I've been following this thread, the I think coolest part is that 
Rob has created an effective tool that has his last name in it.

Can anyone else say they've done that?

If only I could finally perfect that  Johnson Rod Enhancer tool I've 
been working on and needing for years ;)

Happy Holidays!
