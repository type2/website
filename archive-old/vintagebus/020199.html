Subject: open safaris saved me
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

It was a very early morning in January, I was headed
to work, I got no more than a hundred yards and the
windows fogged up on the outside. I pulled over and
wiped them off, but I went another 100 yards and they
fogged right up again (with moisture in the air
stickin' to them on the fronts). 

So I opened one safari to wipe the other, then just
figured I'd drive with them parallel to the pavement.
Nevermind that I froze my knuckles off.

I guess having windshield wipers would have helped,
but I yanked the arms (temporarily) a week earlier so
I could open the safaris.  D'oh!

In high school my buddy bought a &quot;Cal bug&quot; with chrome
bullet-shaped cones where the wipers should go. We got
stuck at work during a rainstorm and ended up grabbing
a squeegee from the stock room, he drove and I stood
out the sunroof with an umbrella over me and squeegeed
the windshield every few seconds. 

Pretty damn dumb but a fun one to tell the kids in a
few years....Or not.
