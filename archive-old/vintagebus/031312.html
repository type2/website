Well,

I finally got around to pulling and disassembling the 1600 DP from the DC.  It had been overheating and making some nasty sounds.  This was a motor I (stupidly)did a top end rebuild on (new P/C's, heads and valve train)about 7K ago.  Needless to say I was'nt happy about doing this, but at least I will do it right this time!  I've taken some pictures and need some help from you.  While I'm going to take it all to Rimco and have them look it over, I'd like some opinions of the knowledgeable list engine re builders (Ronnie, Jake, anyone else)before I go.

Just some background on the teardown:  Stock '71 bus 1600 with DP heads that the bottom end has never been split or rebuilt (I know the history of this motor as well as the fact that even the bearings have VW PN's).  Ran great, but hot and had a strange internal knock (but not the tell tale rod &quot;rattle snake&quot; deceleration one).  There were no chunks in oil and all clearances were well within specs (end play, rod side, deck, P/C etc.).  I did have a bit of trouble getting the cases apart and had to tap them back together which might have lead to a bit of damage to the bearing nearest the pulley (by the dowel pin).  The only real obvious damage that looks outside the scope of normal wear is the already mentioned #4? bearing (I get the numbering confused) damage around the dowel pin hole and some disintegration of the cam thrust bearing.  Big chunk came out of it. Oh yeah, the oil pump drive shaft ends were REALLY worn (I forgot to take a pic of that) as was the cam drive slot.

The crank journals (main and rod) have no ridges and a fingernail will not catch.  The cam journals are a bit worse with some pitting. Lifters are flat but not pitted yet, and I think the dist. drive gear is worn...not sure though.




Please check out the pictures (sorry for the dark ones of the case main saddles) and tell me what you think of the parts and what you think is worn and what you'd do.  I'm trying not to break the bank, but I'm not going to cheep out this time (stop laughing Ronnie).  I'm planning on CW crank, new lifters, cam, bearings, rebuild the rods, CB filtering oil pump (BTW how does that fit beneath the pulley tin?? not much room there), dist. drive gear, crank gear (brass), the basics you know, plus full balancing with crank, pulley, clutch/PP, flywheel.  I'm planning on honing the cylinders and reusing them along with the pistons.  They have 7K on them and look new, should I do new rings??  The case does not have case savers in it now...should I have them put in??  Keep the OG studs?  Seriously thinking of going back to SP heads too.

Here is the link to the pictures:

Thanks for any input, and let me know if you need better pics of anything.
