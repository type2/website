Just was wondering what is the best volkswagen supplier to go through
when ordering sheet metal. I will be needing some metal soon
like....doglegs, bottom section of frontend, rocker panels, front floor
panel.  With so many companies out there like WCM and Wolfsburg West and
RMMW and others which is the best to work with and who was best in your
option if you  had to return parts?  I also need the parts sent pretty
far away. Will these companies accept a APO address?? How about a german
address???

Next question....I am in search of a web site or book on how to take the
material off my bus seats...all of them. The front seats and rear bench
seats. I am not to sure on how to go about it. I want the frames
sandblasted and repainted and I want to put new upholestery on them but
don't know how to take off the old stuff and put the new stuff on. Any
help in this area would be cool.

Thanks in advance for any replies......
