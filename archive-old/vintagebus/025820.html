I was a camera man for CNN for over 5 years.  The story doesn't have to be
&quot;big&quot; just has to be good, have a national interest, the person (producer)
pitching it (the story) just has to be persuasive enough, and most of all, it
HAS TO BE CHEEP!   We didn't call it the &quot;Cheep News Network&quot; for nothing!

&gt; CNN covered &quot;Burning Man&quot; on the tube and with stories on CNN Interactive
&gt; [their online version].
&gt;
&gt; If it's &quot;big enough&quot; for CNN it certainly ought to be big enough for the VW
