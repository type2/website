Hi Paul,
A little oil smoke is fairly common with an engine tilted slightly to one 
side or another just at start up.  The oil makes it's way around the rings 
while the engine is tilted one side or the other.  Since this seems to be 
happening much more on one side than the other sounds like your #3 and/or #4 
cylinder is slightly warped probably due to high engine temps.  So the rings 
are sealing better on that side only at running temp and thus is not eating 
oil a noticable amount of oil while running at least for now.  Would be very 
interesting to run a compression test on it cold, then after injecting oil 
into it, and after it has been warmed up.       Eric&amp;Barb
