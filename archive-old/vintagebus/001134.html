On Saturday afternoon, I wake up bleary-eyed and groggy from a restless 3
hour nap.  It is now about 1PM, and there is just enough time to do some
last minute bus preparations, and get my butt over to Curt Dilday's house,
the launch-site for our cruise out to the Kansas City swap meet on Sunday.

I pack up a few camping items, some blankets, and grab my CD wallet for some
tunes on the ride out.  I head out on Hwy 64 West out to O'Fallon, MO. To
Curts house, and right away, I notice something is up.  The 'new'
single-port motor is not nearly as strong on the hills as I would expect it
to be..  I mean I m having serious troubles on even moderate climbs.  Plus
the temperatures are all over the place!  The heads are running about 550
degrees, and my oil temps are up around 260 degrees...  hot for even a
upright oil-cooler equipped motor.

I'd planned on heading out early so I could stop by Rick Babors house to
scope out his newly lowered bus, and get my drivers side door bottom hinge
welded up.  Ever since I got the bus, the lower hinge on the door has been
in the process of breaking off, and Rick offered to fix her up for me.  But,
I was running a bit late, and by the time I got to Curt's house, he was
ready to go and sitting on the front porch hangin' out waiting for me.  Curt
took some time to admire the ultra-clean installation of the moor, and I
felt around to see just how hot she was. Man, don't touch the dipstick or
you will DIE!  Geesh it was hot!  Well, I'll just take it nice and easy I
suppose, and off we went.

Curt and I headed out west on I-70 with old Blue in the lead, and me
trailing behind.  Our plans were to stop at the &quot;Elvis is Alive&quot; café and
museum, but when we got there we discovered the place closes at like 5PM,
but they let up come in a look around for a bit...  Curt bought himself an
authentic Velvet Elvis, the one featuring the &quot;mature&quot; Elvis complete with
tear streaming down his cheek.  The Elvis was propped up and proudly
displayed in one of the side windows of Blue for the remainder of the trip.
While we were there, some local kiddies tried to sell us some lemonade and
peanuts too, we declined, but it was cute.. I didn't know kids still did
things like that.

We ended up stopping to eat at a Waffle House along the interstate, and upon
leaving is when I noticed the Westy was a bit hard to start when hot as
well...  It took quite a bit of crankin and throttle goosing to get her
fired up. We head west some more, and I started getting one hum-dinger of a
headache..  the kind that so bad it makes you nauseous.  Ugh.  We pulled off
at a truck stop, were I had the privilege of paying about 6 bucks for a
little tiny bottle of Tylenol, but at least it got the job done.

After we got a bit west of Columbia, the winds started picking WAY up...  it
was absolutely BRUTAL.  And as if I weren't running hot enough already,
fighting the head-wind had my head temperature gauge nearly pegged out, and
my oil was no better, running about 280 degrees.  Man, it was bad!  Our
busses were tossed around like toys on the interstate.. if not for the
courage of the fearless crew, Blue and Turk would have been lost.. ;-)
Nearing KC, I spotted a few flags I could sorta gauge the wind speeds from..
a hotel along the highway had one of those gigantic American flags flying..
you know, one of those 8' x 12' or so suckers.. it was blown out taught!
Hardly even flapping.. just BOIINNGGG...  OUT!  The winds must have been at
least 35mph, gusting up to the 50's.  It was a struggle just to keep our
busses up to 50mph in the head-wind!  It was especially hard on me, since I
was driving on my crappy old 14&quot; wheels and tires.  I had planned on
replacing my wheels before the start of the season with a set of 15&quot; rims
and new tires, but time and mostly money prevented me from getting them in
order.. so, I am still driving on my 1/2 bald old car tires I had been
running on the old Deluxe..  ugh...

It was also my fortune to have forgotten to bring any directions, or the
name and # of the list member who offered driveway-camping near the even.  I
also could not find Pink Newells or John Christensens phone numbers
anywhere, the only people I knew in the KC area.  Luckily, Curt had the
directions to the swap meet, and I remembered that the list member with
camping space said he lived 'down the road' from the swap meet.  So, we
headed straight for the swap site, and drove around looking for this guy's
guys house, but no busses were spotted.  We ended up camping for the night
on a residential street across from the school where the swap was supposed
to be.

It got VERY cool that night, and I didn't get much sleep at all...  I spent
most of the night laying there shivering, and digging for more blankets.
The 'nice little neighborhood' we were camped in also turned out to be about
the loudest neighborhood I've ever been in too!  Every few minutes there
were honking horns, trains going by, heavy-metal music, or drunk people
hollering!  By the time morning came, and it was safe to head over to the
swap, it was a cold low-40's-ish degrees outside, cloudy, and VERY windy.

The swap meet itself was OK. Not a whole lot of vintage stuff to be had, but
I did score a vintage metal cooler, and a perfect front over-rider for the
bus.  Curt traded a Bentley manual for a complete set of 15&quot; rims!  Such a
deal! In attendance were Pink Newell, Lance Moeller(SP?) from Springfield,
and Jon Christensen, my personal hero  ;-).  We talked and shot the s**t for
a while, talked about the upcoming Tri-Chapter campout in Eldon, and caught
up on local happenings.  Arriving a little later in  the day was the group
of guys who's names I always forget, but I see them at nearly every show I
go to.  The guys with the beat-up old 23 window deluxe, who always have the
little Honda mini-bikes, and their friend with the Dove-Blue late 50's SO-23
Westfalia.  We talked for a long time, and they as usual told all sorts of
stories of when their friend used to own my bus.  We also had a good time
making fun of some pick-up truck in the parking lot, with human skulls all
over it...  we're talking on the dash, tire valve caps, lock button tops,
the works!  The only thing missing was a chrome skull shifter with flashing
red eyes!  LOL.. I have video of it...  we gave it a 'thumbs up' on the
Rad-O-Meter.

The major reason Curt and I came to the swap in the 1st place, was that this
would be a homecoming for our busses. You see, it was at this very swap meet
last year that Curt and I both found these busses, and bought and came home
with them.  That's an entirely different story though, and one I think I've
already wrote about..  check the archives ;-), or maybe Curt can write that
one up for us all?...

About noon though, it was time for us to start the journey back home.
Before leaving, I checked my timing, carb, etc. just to see if maybe I
overlooked something in the tune-up.  I also did some adjustments to my fan
shroud, as it had started scarping the fan again.  We pulled out, and headed
home, this time with a 50mph Tail-Wind!  WA-HOO!!  With the tail wind, I was
able to maintain 60mph, and my temps stayed about 50-75 degrees cooler..
still very tired in the hills, and still WAY to hot for my liking, but at
least I made it home.  On the way back, we ran across a fellow bus traveler
at a Stuckey's.  It was father/son group who was on their way back from
camping in the Ozarks..  headed back to Nebraska I think it was.  He had
just bought the bus (a very clean 70?) from Kalifornia, and this was their
first camping trip in it.

By about 7PM that night, I was finally back in my driveway.. just in time
for Simpsons, and Futurama!  I had gotten only about 17mpg on the trip, and
that had me in a real tizzy...   if I can't get at least 20mpg, Brian is not
a happy camper.  I was supposed to be leaving the next day for my mom's in
Huntsville, but another day would be needed to try and work out the
overheating problems with the bus, and my lawn HAD to be mowed before I
could leave for a 1-week trip.  I decided to postpone my departure for one
day to take care of these details, and hopefully work out the engine
problems. So many social engagements, so little time...

Next time - Departure!  And the Journey South!

-Brian
