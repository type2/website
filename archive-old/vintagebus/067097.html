&gt; I have the german  head lights in my 59 and when I apply the brake my park 
&gt; lights come on inside the headlights. When the headlight switch is out for 
&gt; the parklights nothing changes that I can see.   Is this a ground problem?  
&gt; Or do I need to look elsewhere?

Hi Rick,
Either it is wired incorrectly, and/or the switch needs rebuilding, and/or 
was rebuilt and insides aligned improperly.
