Thanks for the suggestions regarding the connections back there.  I will see 
if I can hunt down some of the bullet or knife style connectors later this
week, since I'd rather have the connections &quot;inside&quot; if for no other reason
than it looks a little nicer.  Failing that though, I'll go with the
disconnects I've already got.  Thanks for the great input from everyone.

One of my lights is still missing a lense though.  I know that the regular 
reverse light lenses are NLA, anybody know about these?  They're Hella.  If 
a pic would help I can take one of my good one.  Are these relatively common
so that I can hope to find them at a swap somewhere?
