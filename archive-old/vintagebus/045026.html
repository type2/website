Hi Virge,
It is a bad thing! At best it will just blow out your cheapie header muffler 
at worse the piston rings are getting washed away by fuel instead of oil 
lubrication.  You could have adsjusted your carb incorrectly or more likely 
you have the wrong jetting for your engine size, muffler, air cleaner and 
even engine compartment.  Do also check for leaks in the intake manifold!
