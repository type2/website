in my quest for cleaning stuff (fire related) i found the camp chairs
at walmart, hidden away in the obscure camping area (most of the store
is
christmas stuff) also had the roll up wooden tables like vwhoard and i
have.

in the big guest for the canopy cover like thom ordered from costco and
oldvw
were looking for, on another quest for shop clean-up supplies (fire
related)
i came across  those covers at BIG-K for 175.00 and was told if they
run out
i could special order and they would have delivered to the store at no
extra charge, it's good that in havasu all we have is wal-mart and
k-mart so we
don't have to rely on costco or home depot so much and do venture into
these
discount stores, ps wal-mart is were i get gl 4 gear oil in 5 gallon
pails for 22.00 dollars.

got half the electric up today, ready to test fire the computers
most of the parts sorted through, found a lot of long lost bus and
porsche
parts due to this unfortunate fire, guess it was time to remodel anyway,

to help raise funds for this i will be posting pictures of 2 of my
buses that will be for sale, and some photos of some others that also
might have to be sold to cover my loses.

thanks for all the support    ronnie   www.type2parts_dot_com

pss, i have p mailed a few people and have been informed that mail
isn't getting delivered, so this is to let those who need to know that
i have responded and all is well and getting better, every day.
