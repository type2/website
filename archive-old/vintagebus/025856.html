&lt;&lt; With reference to those popouts, my '61 Doublecab has that style, but I 
was only able to find NOS barndoor latches.  There must be something 
different about the frames, because the barndoor latches won't hold the 
window shut quite right.  I've got the correct latch for one side, so I'll 
try that soon and see if there's an improvement in latching.

I am told that the place for the pop out latch to screw into on the * body*  
is in a slightly differnt place in barndoors with the horizontal bitframes 
than in double cabs with the horizontal bit frames, and the latches do fit 
funky in the wrong vehicle
