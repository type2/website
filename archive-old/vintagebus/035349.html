I'm planning to change the flywheel oils seal on my new bus soon, and

for the wisdom of the collective.  Some guys I was speaking to said also
to replace an 'o' ring
behind the flywheel nut.  Is this 'o' ring a regular part and easily
available from the usual outlets ?

yes- when you change your main seal change the O ring.   Look at the FW  once 
you have it off the motor, the side that goes towards the crankshaft.  there 
should be a o ring in there- pull it out with a little screwdriver.   Some 
FWs are stepped, for the stepped crank, though 99.37% of them are 6V with the 
small clutch, the stepped ones dont take the o ring.     the inner edge of 
the o ring gets flattened/worn and seals not so well.  they are cheap (50 
cents over here) and should be available where you get the main seal.   just 
make sure the indent for the o ring is clean, and pop the new one in there.
