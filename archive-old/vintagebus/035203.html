Subject: RE: [VB] Dangerous Brakes!

Great point Ronnie.

I have thought about this issue when planning this install, but I was
figuring the rear to lock up before the front.  Why I say this is that there
is a proportioning valve housing in the brake lines to the rear on the bay
window busses.  I think the 4 drum busses did not have a rear proportioning
valve..?

Anyway I have the proportioning valve, but am not sure what to do with it...
Maybe a paperweight :) 

Also remember that 90% of a cars braking is done by the front wheels, so
having a week rear may not be that big of a deal..?

Maybe this would be a great excuse to buy the disc brake kit adapter for the
baywindow discs :)  
   

Take Care,
