Hi, Looking for a decent set of doglegs for a
`61...mainly a driver side...I can save my passenger
side but woudl take both.

ORRRRRrr does anyone know who make the best repop
panel doglegs...the ones I have seen are the `65-`67
style with the seam running down the top like barndoor
doglegs.  Is there a repop manufactured without the
seam?

Todd
