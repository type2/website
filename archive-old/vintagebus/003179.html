  Hi, I'm new to the list so bear with me!
 Jon I have a '61 Westy I'm bringing back from the dead (slowly) and I have
all the wood cabinets out of it. I live in Lake Havasu (Ronnie &amp; vwhowards
area) AZ. I will be making templates someday but e-mail me and I'll try to
help out for now. I realize I'm far away but you're more then welcome to
take a look if you need to.
  Some of you volks know me from e-bay, &quot;Restore an Old Bus&quot; t-shirts and at
BBB IV I had the green &amp; white '67 bug.
