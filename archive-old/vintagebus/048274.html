&lt;&lt; There is a little hole at the back rear part of the door, far from the
hinge
 and close to the handle, to drain water. The hole lines up with another hole
 in the door frame. That hole goes into the upper rear part of the fron wheel
 well. I have a lake in there. It does not drain out of there. I don't get it.
  &gt;&gt;
Hi Bob,
That part of the wheel well is called the &quot;Dog Leg&quot; and in 1955-62 or so there
was only one drain hole in the forward lower part of the dog leg.  In the
1962-1967 buses they have two drain holes in the top rear of the dog leg and
the earlier front one.  The rear one looks like it drains into the pillar to
the rear of the door and then on into the rocker panel.  It is a good idea to
at least once a year to inspect and clean out these drain holes to make sure
that water and dirt do not hang around in there causing even more rust.  You
might want to take a clothes hanger and turn it into a striaght wire to feel
your way though this rear drain area till the water and dirt drain out.
During the summer we like to spray water in both directions through these
drians to really rinse them out.    Eric &amp; Barb
