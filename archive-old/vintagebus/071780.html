Subject: Re: [VB] engine pull (was cooked alternator)

Your engine will run happier and longer due to warming up quicker.   you want 
the engine not too hot, not too cold, but just right.      I was reading How 
to Hot Rod your VW the otehr day, a 1970 edition, and it says to leave the 
thermostat system in place too.  interesting hm.  

check your main, oil cooler seals, and make sure the grommets are there and 
good, axle boots, etc.   As it is accessible easily now.

&lt;&lt; engine.  I figured since I already had the gas and elec. disconnected, 
&quot;it's
 only four more bolts&quot;
 
 Now I a question....1600DP
 
 All that flap stuff in the fan housing...do I really need it?  I understand 
it
 is part of a thermotsat system.  Just curious.
 
 Now it's off to the bead blasters with my engine tin and time to replace the
 TO bearing while I am at it.    Oh yeah, I guess I will replace my alternator
 too :)
