RE Axle boots:

I have had really good luck with the GEBA brand of german swing boots. I
know that WORLD PAC, a huge nation-wide foreign parts distributor
carries them for next to nothing, and they retail for about $8 each with
a nice shop mark-up. If you all cant get these, i have a decent local
supplier and can ship them, but I'd be realy suprised if one of our
web-based suppliers cant get em for ya.

Ronnie F _at_ havasu once talked about a difference betwen axle boots as
far as fit goes, between the older small-nut rear ends with smaller axle
tube outside diameter, and the 64/5 and later &quot;big nut&quot; trans with
larger axle tube OD, but I cant remember how that went. Ronnie?

I have had good luck with these GEBAs on my big nut trannies. But i
believe that these are a regular maintainance replacement item, not
supposed to last 10 years. I do them about every other tranny oil
change. about every 30k miles. Hint: I really like to do the oil swap,
boots swap, redux oil change ( whole rear end service) when the engine
is out for whatever other reason. The bus has its arse in the air,
wheels are off, there is a big work space where the engine should be,
life is good. I am a better mechanic when I have proper space to work. I
am not advising that you pull the engine do do this work, but i wouldnt
scoff at that idea either.
