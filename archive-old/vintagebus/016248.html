Two possibilities you don't mention having checked:

- plug wires (particularly the coil/distributor wire)
- generator bearings

Bad wires, or bad connections for the wires, can certainly do it.  So
can a flaky coil, but that's less likely.

If the generator bearings are going, you should hear something from
the back whenever the slowdown happens.  If it's at night, you'll
probably notice the headlights dimming, as well.  Pull the belt off,
and spin it by hand.  Should coast through several revolutions in
either direction with a firm initial spin.
