&gt; I also noticed that the accelerator cable rubs against the side of

&gt; condition or do I need to make some changes?

It seems to be a 'normal' condition for our buses, which have been updated
with different trannies and other stuff over the years. The solution that
I came up with, after wearing a deep groove way into one tranny for 15
years (and greasing it regularly as a fix!), is simply to slip a length of
VW webbed neoprene gas line over the cable, about 14 inches or so length,
and the problem is solved. Just long enough to keep the cable from rubbing 
the tranny. Standard fix in my buses now.
