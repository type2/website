Subject: Generator Woes (the continuing saga)

Well, I got the rebuilt generator back into the bus yesterday, and life was
good; no red light, etc.  I took it for a 3 mile spin and although I could
hear a slight whiring sound I didnt think much of it, thinking that the
generator had to get some miles under its belt before the bearings settled
down.

Today I took the bus out to run a few errands and I could smell something
that _almost_ was like burning paper.  When I got to the store, there was a
distinct line of what looked like melted solder splashes on the roof of
engine compartment and on the tin.  It was about a half an inch wide and was
in line with the opening of the generator. I figured something was wrong and
started to head home.  About half way there the red light came back on.  My
inital thoughts are that I got a bum rebuilt generator.

Before I yank it out and 'bark' at the FLAPS, I was thinking that maybe
there is something _I might have done_  to cause this.  The only thing I can
think of is that I did not replace the voltage regulator.  Any thoughts
would be appreciated.

PS I am really glad I did not pull the engine for this project; I would have
been really pi**ed if I had pulled the engine only to have the replacement
device crap out on me after driving the bus about 15 miles.

Thanks in advance;
Rich
