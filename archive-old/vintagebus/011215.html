&gt; &gt; &gt; like what year? 70
&gt; &gt; ANY year 79 or older, they will all fit in a panel as there is no under
&gt; &gt; rear seat heat tube to interfere with.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; If you had a standard i think 72 down has the legs that are offset to
&gt; &gt; clear heat stuff...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; but in a kombi and panel, anything goes as far as fit... the newer rear
&gt; &gt; seats even have way kewl headrests ;)&gt; 
 
 The upper part of the later bay back seats attached differently than the splitty ones, as they were made to attach to release doohickeys so you could fold the seat down,
 
..but you have a panel, do you have the bits on the floor for the seat hold down bolts, or the threaded insert for the rear seat bracket for the upper part of the rear seat?
