&gt;what is a door scraper? and how did you use a wiper blade to perform this

*********************
At the top of the Driver and Passenger Doors, there is a 60&quot; long &quot;T&quot;
shaped rubber that actually acts more as a seal, but it does scrape the
body as the door is opened and closed.  The problem with the replacement
ones being repro'd are that they are TOO STIFF, sometimes causing some
difficulty in opening said doors.

I used to make these in a much softer EPDM compound, much more flexible.
I'm working on re-activating my tooling and start to make these again
sometime late this fall and winter.
