&gt;Rather than change the suspension around to lower my bus, I was wondering
if
&gt;anyone has tried just a wheel change and a lower profile tire and if so,
how
&gt;it worked out?


Well I have changed the wheels and tires on my singlecab significantly, but
not for the purpose of lowering, for handling mostly. I had a set of super
lightweight aluminum sandrail wheels made with stock offset on the outside
and 1 inch of width added to the inside. Then I put 195/65R15 's on the back
and 195/60R15 's on the front. The difference got rid of the squat it had
with the rear end set right. To get it to sit dead level you had to raise up
the rear and camber the hell out of the rear wheels and it looked like crap.
Now it sits level and corners a lot better. The rears clear the fender lip
by less than a quarter inch, but don't touch. 205's were a no go. The lower
profile tires show more fenderwell opening up front, so you want pretty
fenderwells. I had the speedo recalibrated for the wheel/tire combo. I have
bought the wheels and tires for four of my vehicles from one shop and they
are reasonable about experimenting. I went through several size and profile
changes before settling on this one. The 60's looked ridiculous on the rear
and the 65's look just right. Tried 50's up front and it looked like a
couple of wraps of electrical tape around the rim, silly. Though you could
go to 14 inch rims and get a smidge lower, the look up front would be more
pronounced. While this combo looks pretty good on the singlecab, it might
not look very good on a bus. As to lowering, it doesn't have much effect for
that. Top speed is reduced, too. As this is my daily driver, freeway speed
wasn't really the object.
