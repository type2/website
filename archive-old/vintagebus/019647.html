Today was another big step towards getting the Westy streetable.  Although the
damn steering lock bolt is still out ;-)  I received a number of helpful 
suggestions from listees both on and off list, and I plan to try them all, in
order of intrusiveness!

First on the list was to put the rebuilt engine...in the Kombi!  I needed some 
parts off of it, so I needed to get it to its new home in Marietta.  First
thing I did was remove all the sparkplugs and basically double the gap on 
each of them.  I love my CDI :-)  Engine in, I jumped the bus' flat battery
off the &quot;other&quot; car.  It took a while to crank but finally clattered to
life.  I was kind of disappointed in how it ran...kinda worse than before.
Then it hit me that it probably needed to be tuned.  A minute with the timing
light and a couple adjustments to the 34 PICT-3 had it sorta purring, still
sounding like a sick purring though.  I let it idle and loaded it up.  I drove
it around the back of the house to load more stuff in it -- and DAMN if it 
didn't run smoother than anything I've ever owned after that!  My guess is
that it just needed to be run a bit, since the choke was fully off when 
idling rough in the driveway.

I drove to Marietta and it was a beautiful thing.  Despite having only half the
pedal travel I was supposed to, and the bus being heavily loaded with VW parts,
I was able to do 60 the whole way, including up hills.  Nice.

Earlier in the day, I went to Home Depot and purchased some wood for the floor
in the back.  Dave E. turned me on to some sound deadining material to put 
beneath it, and pointed me to a source of Baltic Birch paneling to replace my
rotted panels.  We're probably going to go pick some up this weekend.  While 
at HD I picked up some fiberglass insulation for behind the panels.  I noticed
there was no rust behind the original fiberglass, it having been given 30 odd
years of existence in a leaky bus, so I figure it is ok to use it again.
It's pink instead of yellow, but what're you gonna do ;-)

Lots of school work next week but I still hope to be driving the bus by this
weekend.  Almost certainly it'll be rolling by the end of the coming weekend.
I'm pretty excited to finally be looking at the end of the road as far as 
getting to drive my Westy.  Of course, it'll never be &quot;finished&quot; :-)

Man I feel so great I might even put up that other manual tonight.  Somebody
stop me!
