&lt;&lt; I have seen the pop-rivets in quite a few pickups.  They basically 
pop-riveted the strips from the underside so there wouldn't be any 
inconsistancy in the uper surfaces of the strips for things to hang up on.  
I'm not sure if this was a change from a previous method or not.  Does anyone 
else on the list have any further insight into this question? &gt;&gt;
Hi Jon,
Our 63 when we got back in about 85 had no wood left, but still had the 
rivets.  They had been installed from the top down through the wood strips.  
We have an early 60s VW truck sales brochure that shows the SC bed via bird 
view with the heads of the rivets recessed by counterbore.   Eric&amp;Barb
