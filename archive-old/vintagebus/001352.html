i was removing my rear tailgate from my 57 single cab to fix it (cause noone
will sell me a nice one), and all the screws came out, not too bad. Then i
got to the 4th and final one. Of course it gave me probs. It was actin like
it wanted to turn so i gave it more wacks with the impact driver...... now
it just spins freely and sqweaks.
Basically whatever holds it in the back has come loose or broken a spot to
be able to spin freely.
Q: how is the nut held in? spot welded or stuck in a square channel to
disable it from spinning?
Q: whats the best way of goin about  accessing  the nut once i drill out the
screw? have to cut on the square channel in the back? Or perhaps start
drillin spot welds?

TIA -wade-
