&gt;  That being said, I'll probably be there when
&gt; the gates open.  Unless the Nor CA listees wants to take a concensus on
&gt; which show to attend, kinda like the OCTO vs SOTO thing in So CA.

I'm a VW swap freak and any show that's going on is worth it, especially when
it's less than an hour away.
I think Goodtimes puts a bit more effort into promoting their shows, and with
sponsors from Southern California as well I'm sure attendance will be
improved..............................................
