Subject: Quick Question - front door opening
Date: Fri, 20 Nov 1998 10:44:30 -0600

Quick Question:  On my 58, the front doors open really far.  Like about
110 degrees which puts them further around than sticking straight out
from the bus.  Is this the way they're supposed to be?  Or is there some
kind of stop or strap that keeps them from going to far?

Thanks.
