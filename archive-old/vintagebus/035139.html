&lt;&lt; were cab dividers stock on panels  -------are mirror arms painted the
color of the bus or left as is???? &gt;&gt;
Hi Pete,
The dividers were a standard from the factory stock part on non-walk-thru
panels.  Of course almost anything could be ordered from the factory.  We saw
a rust free straight bench seat panel that had had a ambulance slider divider
in it in a VW wrecking yard in Zering Iowa.  At least before we saw it had
that style of divider some idiot had cut open the roof to get out this
divider for another bus.
As for mirror arms all buses seem to have come with the drivers door mirror
arm.  As for the passenger side that could have been a dealer install, or
maybe a factory special order, or it seems that some mosels of the bus might
have come with mirror arms on both sides.  So the factory should have painted
the arms that came from there at the same time the buses were painted.
