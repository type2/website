&gt;Anyone ever here of the S.E.S. Fuel Injector.  It attached between the
&gt;fuel pump and the Carb I think - it had a solenoid and 'Velocity Stack'
&gt;- with a switch that went on the dash - a guy tells me he had this on
&gt;his 72 beetle and it would double the HP.  Should I give him the $25.00
&gt;he asking?

Sounds sort of like the fuel line magnets that are always sold and then
rise to prominence again when gas prices go up.  If it worked and didn't
screw up the engine, you'd be able to find one under the hood of every
Detroit, Tokyo, and Wolfsburg car, or perhaps on every pump at the gas
station.  I might pay $2.50 (Canadian) for it for the giggle value...
