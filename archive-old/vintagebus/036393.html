taking a wire wheel to rust is like taking a squirt gun to a forest
fire. buying that $10 pink crap in a bottle won't work on 30-40 year
old rust. ya gotta media blast or cut &amp; replace. RUST NEVER SLEEPS!
good quality rubber seals is all you'll need when the job is done right
the 1st time. take it from someone who's been at this resto game since
the 70's. as for your paint use omni single or double stage urethane to
prevent future metal damage. good luck to all of you rust
