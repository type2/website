You are kidding right??  They are about $25.  Let me see you would rather 
pull the engine TWICE.  Once to try and burn off the oil from your disc and 
then the second time to replace it after it has really gone??  I truly don't 
get it.  

but to answer your question yes.  you soak the disc in white gas/Coleman 
fuel, then light the disc on fire.  the oil will be completely burned off and 
you will drive like normal.  i used this same technique on a set of brake 
shoes that got soaked from a blown wheel cylinder will on a road trip.  i was 
able to successfully make a repair and still used the shoes for many 1000's 
of miles using the above procedure.

****you assume your own risk by performing this procedure.

have fun
