&lt;&lt; By &quot;GRB&quot; do you mean &quot;RGB&quot;?  yes, there's a seal, but that might not be

Hi Eric&amp;Thom,
It is likely that what is the cause of the leak is that the RGB bearings are 
going bad and allowing the stub axle to wobble and thusly make the axle seal 
leak.  So it might be a good idea to buy a set of bearings for this job just 
in case this what is happening or for a future repair when a bearing store 
might not be availible just when you need.  To check the RGB bearings block 
the front wheels, release the E-brake and jack up the rear wheel in question. 
 Then wiggle the wheel up and down and side to side if the wiggle at the axle 
nut is 1/32&quot; or more the bearings on the lower stub axle are going bad.  Also 
when you drain the RGB check for shavings in the bottom of the oil drain pan 
that you cleaned the bottom of thoughly before using.  If you find metal 
shavings as big or bigger than a pin head and more than just a couple this is 
a really good sign that it is time to replace bearings.   Eric&amp;Barb
