Yes , Thom, but you didn't mention what year you were getting, early doglegs
at Pomona 35-150 per side, early rear corners big cut 100 per side, late dog
legs 25-75 per side, late corners 25-75 per side, BARNDOOR doglegs 200 plus
per side, rear corners large cut 150 per side (I have never seen any of the
BD parts sell)m nose clips 100-250, ruff cut, clean skins (not BD) 200 to
400, these would be ready to install with no cleaning. These parts are out
there most of the time and I come across them on a regular basis, except for
the barndoor. A cool trick though is the repop doglegs have the same seam on
top as barndoors, all you would have to do is add an outer skin to enlarge
the lip and nobody could tell, Repop late dogleg 75.00 a side, when I had
the outer skins they were 150.00 for the pair.

I got this message regarding my quest for parts.  I was expecting to pay,
but
wasn't prepared for *this* much.  Or am I suffering a rare instance of
cheepness?
Note they haven't qualified the condition of the parts, either.

***
WE HAVE THE DOGLEGS FOR $200.00 A SIDE REAR CORNERS FOR $200.00 A SIDE AND A

THE WHOLE FRONT NOSE CLIP FOR $500.00.  TAKE IN MIND THAT WE HAVE TO CUT THE

BUS APART.  A LOT OF LABOR.
