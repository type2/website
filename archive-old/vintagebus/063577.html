--part1_a5.2e24f965.2ac1e75a_boundary

Hi everyone,
   I tried some sggestions for shops in the area and no luck!, one place 
actually came out and looked at the truck and took a few shots and said he 
will have to talk to his guys about if they want to take on the job! I will 
give him a little time to decide but I will go on with plan B and start 
looking elsewhere (out of state). Most of the outside body work is done, just 
the gates and upper and lower beds is where the majority of the bodywork that 
needs to be done. And a few other things, but I can go into detail with the 
place that will take on the project. Also I will need to find an engine 
rebuilder, any ideas?
                                                    Steve 57 singlecab (EARLY)
