Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [T2] .009, There MUST be some advantages

I know a guy that does this. He is on the T3 list, has a stash ot used parts
and has sources for new Bosch replacement parts. He rebuilds them in his
spare time. He also sells parts. He probably has a couple of cans for your
FI dizzys.

&gt; &gt;VW did put mech advance in the T3 with FI. It was a combined mech advance
&gt; &gt;and vacuum advance.
&gt; &gt;Steve Bradley
&gt;
&gt;  well, that's kind of cheating... it still has a vac can on it, so not
true
&gt; mech-only.
&gt;
&gt; this is the T3 dizzy with the little black socket on the side, right? that
&gt; is actually my favorite distributor, but AGAIN, the 2 i have no longer
&gt; function properly - vac cans died.
&gt;
&gt; any vendors on the list seeing an opportunity here?
&gt;
&gt; repopping the various vac cans and rebuilt dizzys seems to be in need.
