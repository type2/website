&gt; .......I've been a fellow &quot;listee&quot; for over a year now and I've made a few
&gt; observations.  First, I want to send a special &quot;thank you&quot; to those of you
who
&gt; answer our questions on a regular basis.  (Erick and Barb, Clara, Ray,
Ronnie,
&gt; Matt, etc.)  Many of us realize that you spend a great deal of thought and
&gt; time in responding to our questions.  It's people like you that keep this
&gt; hobby (obsession?) going!  I hope to meet you all some day and personally
&gt; thank you for your contributions.  With much appreciation....Steve (66
SAMBA)

I'll second the thought!
