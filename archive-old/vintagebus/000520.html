I am going to jump in here, state what I think I know, and get the 
electro-chemist lurkers on the list stirred up.  See disclaimer at the end.

&gt;  On this topic of galvanic reactions.  We have been wondering 
&gt;  if the steel copper plated washers for the sump plate have the plating for 
&gt;  some sort of corrosion protection, or reduction at least.  Or are they 
that 
&gt;  way to reduce the differant metals of the sump, case, and the formation 
&gt;  of acid in the used oil?
The copper is there to provide a corrosion protective coating to the steel.  
It is certainly not there to provide galvanic isolation, it would do just the 
opposite.  The washers actually never touch the case, just the sump plate, 
studs, and cap nuts which are pretty much steel.  If they touched the case, 
then you would have real problems with galzanic corrosion potential.  The 
copper coating is less likely to corrode (see below), so it protects the 
steel.  Same concept as the wire in your Mig welder.

&gt;  On another note, in days long past when the 36 HP engine was it for VW.  
&gt;  There were kits that inserted a magnesuim rod into the sump area of the 
case 
&gt;  by way of replacing the sump plug that was off to one side of the sump 
plate.
&gt;  This pure magnesuim rod would react, and supposedly nuetralize oil acid 
&gt;  formation before it could attack the case, or bearings surfaces.
&gt;  Just another set of things to keep in mind!   Eric&amp;Barb
The magnesium would do nothing to neutralize acid in the oil.  What the 
magnesium did was provide cathodic protection by being a sacrificial anode.  
Magnesium (along with zinc) are highly anodic metals and will be a galvanic 
anode when in proximity to a more noble metal (the cathode).  Actually, there 
are no metals more anodic than magnesium.  Galvanic action will occur when an 
electro-chemical circuit exists between two dissimilar metals.  The anode 
(less noble) will become corroded (hence the term &quot;sacrificial anode&quot;) and 
the cathode (more noble) will be protected (hence the term &quot;cathodic 
protection&quot;).  Magnesium anodes are placed on underground steel fuel storage 
tanks to provide cathodic protection for the same reason.  The rate of the 
galvanic action will be influenced by the conductivity of the circuit (such 
as in the presence of an electrolyte (salt water)), the surface area, 
proximity, and especially the difference in the galvanic potential of the two 
metals.  For a chart which shows the differences in galvanic potential of 
various metals see:  http://www.mtgloans_dot_com/~thelen/1galv.html.  (Side note: 
 The chart is wrong where it says &quot;Electric current flows from plus to 
minus&quot;.  Electrons have negative charge, protons have positive charge. Thats 
why you hook up the negative lead from the battery charger to the cathode in 
the electrolysis rust removal process (see below).  And yes, the electrical 
system of the bus is powered by electrons flowing out of the battery through 
the GROUND strap. End side note)

Least I stop now, electro-chemistry has two other applications that are 
important to our splitties: rust protection and rust removal.  

Rust protection - 
The oxidation of iron is an electro-chemical process.  When we coat steel 
with zinc phophate, zinc rich primer, or galvanizing, we are actually 
providing cathodic protection.  The zinc becomes the sacrificial anode, and 
protects the steel cathode from corrosion.  One way to think of it is that 
when oxidation is going to happen (from that nasty salt water providing a 
nice electrolytic circuit), it will oxidize whatever is easiest to oxidize, 
and zinc oxidizes real easily.  Look at where zinc is on the galvanic 
potential chart.  This is the opposite of the principle applied in the copper 
coating on the steel washers.  So why would we protect steel by putting on 
something that has more corrosion potential?  Two reasons: 1) When zinc 
oxidizes, it is not very noticable.  It oxidizes very similar to aluminum, it 
will become dull, sometimes gray depending on the conditions, and certainly 
not as unsightly as ferrous oxide and more importantly 2) when zinc oxidizes, 
the oxidation on the surface of the zinc will actually form a sealing layer 
which resists further oxidation.  This is very unlike steel, which continues 
to rust away.

Rust removal - 
This is easy.  Remember No Quarter's electrolysis bath?  Basically 
electrolysis is a way of reversing the process of iron oxidation.  Here a 
direct electrical current from the cathode (the wheel rim)  to the anode (the 
steel rods) takes the place of difference in galvanic potential.  The rust is 
pushed off the rim to the steel rods.  Pretty cool.  Look up electrochemistry 
on the web if you want to know more.

Disclaimer:  What I have stated above is what &gt;I&lt; think is correct, and I am 
trying to be Mr. Smartypants.  I have been wrong before.  So if you think I 
am WRONG, WRONG, WRONG, WRONG, I want to hear from you (off list if 
appropriate).
