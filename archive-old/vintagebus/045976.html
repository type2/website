&lt;&lt;  Also, demand either SKF or FAG bearings. Avoid 
Timken unless you drive a  ford, and never use any moving 
parts made in China or India.  &gt;&gt;

The FAG's seem to hold up slightly better (?) than the SKF's
for some reason.  Or it just maybe I just think they do! ;)
Anyway, Timken does not make ball bearings, only rollers,
and I don't think that they make the N207E outboard roller
bearing for the stub axle (again, ??)  Go for the two brands
that Jack recommended and you'll be just fine.
