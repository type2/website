Subject: Flywheel oil seal question
Message-ID: &lt;37773A40.2DFF68A8_at_physics.salford.ac_dot_uk&gt;

I'm planning to change the flywheel oils seal on my new bus soon, and
have some questions
for the wisdom of the collective.  Some guys I was speaking to said also
to replace an 'o' ring
behind the flywheel nut.  Is this 'o' ring a regular part and easily
available from the usual outlets ?
