 one of my volkswagens suffers the same oil-slinging-from-the-pulley problem. 
 the engine did this from newly rebuilt.  better venting helped but did not 
stop the oil from making its way past the pulley.  my guru suggested that i 
get a press-in sand seal and associated pulley.  i was on the verge of buying 
the set up when the parts guru suggested that this approach was like putting 
a band-aid on a severed appendage - not enough of a solution and the wrong 
one anyway.  too many gurus....  now i'm back to doing nothing... well, i am 
driving slower and that seems to help... or maybe the oil level is too low.

I had the same deal, but it fixed itself.  aint that sweet?
