Please take if off the list.  It was boring the first time through.
Jon has always done alright by me.  Knows alot more about busses than me
and helps out a lot. I don't have any problem with that kind of person.
Since you hide, we really don't know what good johndenver666 is.
I guess you know case numbers. Seems like I had an H case with 6mm studs.
Not that it matters all that much, I just like driving busses.
Take a good dump, get laid, go see a psychotherapist, whatever it takes
to get over it, or at least take it off this list.
