Subject: white rhino liner

Most of the bed spray companies offer white. though it is my experience that
they don't like to and they charge twice as much. Seems they have to
completely clean out there equipment to keep any residual from tinting the
white.
I think white looks great but it should be noted that anything that can
leave a floor scuff on it probably will.
