Happy Holidays Volks!!! While going thru my &quot;stuff&quot;, I found a different
type air- cleaner set up than I have seen before. It is about 11&quot; in
diameter and sits on a stand about 4&quot; tall. Has four metal bands leading up
to a hole in the top of the air cleaner. Part # IGM40875    141 129 613 with
VW stamped. Anyone know what it is and does anyone need one? TBear
