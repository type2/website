Subject: Re: Listees ? Vintage and Type II

&gt; From: &quot;Jerry &amp; Melissa Jess&quot; &lt;vwstuff53_at_msn_dot_com&gt;
&gt; Just wondering why the Type II list is always twice as long as the 
&gt; Vintage
&gt; list ?

I'm on both lists even though I currently just have a splitty (but have 
owned 3 early bays).  Since the splits and early bays share basic 
engine characteristics, I think some of the engine chatter just ends up 
staying on the bay list -- I suspect other splitty drivers lurk there 
for similar reasons.  My 65 bus has a 1600SP engine, so engine queries 
go to the bay list.

Also, it's probably true that more bays are drivers rather than museum 
pieces or toys (no disrespect intended - mine's partly a toy), so more 
need for regular chatter from day to day usage.

And also I'd say it's partly an apples/oranges thing: while there are 
plenty of multi-generational bus geeks, it's also true that, say, a '78 
Westy and a '62 SC attract different people.  So comparing the list 
traffic is tricky.

But of course the main reason is as you suggest -- splitty drivers are 
just that much more competent and don't need to ask so many questions.
