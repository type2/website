Subject: Bug-O-Rama War
Mime-Version: 1.0

I've been talking with Hole family in an attempt to clear up this ugly mess
with acusations, insults, cross-acusations, and whatnot.   I really don't
want there to be any bad blood between us, and this was turning into a
Hatfield's vs McCoy's.  

I *did* make a statement that was factually incorrect, and that was with
regards to Bob Hole cutting up early American cars into street rods, and
for that I apologize.  I don't actually know Bob Hole, and I should not
have gone after him on the *personal* level.
