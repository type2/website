Subject: testing a 6V clock
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

can I test a 6V deluxe clock in my 12V bus? Oherwise,
how can I do it other than getting a 6V auto battery?

Also, is there any way to get the chrome bezel off the
front?

and... what color are the face elements originally?
Are the hands white? What about the 1/4&quot; beveled lip
just inside the lens? Mine is dark grey-brown. Does
anyone have a pic of a restored or NOS clock?

The back of my clock has a flat tab on the bulb and
another on the white part of the case back. Is this
the  positive, and the ground just occurs by mounting
it?
