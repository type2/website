So one has to consistantly say over and over to themself that they are towing
and get rid of any distractions onboard.  On the other hand we have towed
pre-1968 buses with pre-1968 buses and the effect is sicking.  You are
consistantly being pushed around even on the straight roads and have to make
steering corrections like a mad man, especially when going down the slightest
hill...

ya- especially if the towed bus has bad steeing.  Like you said, taking the
motor out and moving any other weight to the tow vehicle is a good idea.
towed a bug (w/o motor) 500 miles with my 61 bus, but would not tow a bus that
far with a bus, too much stress.

&gt;rather than having a hitch attach where the bumper brackets bolt to the bus,
&gt;or to the bumper brackets, it is sturdier to have a tow hitch that extends

that
&gt;just keeps the tow ball from falling down.  This way you are towing with a
&gt;much stronger part of the bus.  

Remember, though, if it is only attached at the torsion tube and the
bumper, the bumper is carrying the majority of the tongue weight.  This is
probably OK for towing another vehicle with 4 wheels as long as the
attachment points are in a horizontal plane of the hitch mount, but if you
pull a two-wheel trailer or something that's off-line you might yank the
bumper down...

hm- as I've only towed vehicles with a fixed tow bar  (all wheels on ground)I
wasn't thinking about that -   I guess if I towed like that it would be a good
idea to modify the tow set up so there is more structure holding up the tongue
weight.

however,  the set up I mention is still better than having all the tongue
weight - and -  the pull on the bumper/bumper brackets
