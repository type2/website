Hi Jon,
When you did all this work did you install both rear shifter rod bushings?  
For the forward end of the front shift rod you need to buy a 211 711 197 
Sleeve - Gearshift rod guide from Chassi No. 216 028 112.  If this sleeve has 
been missing for too long the bore it is supposed to go into and the support 
pin are probably worn badly.  You might luck out to have the forward end of 
the shift rod bore for this pin and sleeve welded shut and redrilled or 
prehaps it is time to get a new/used forward shift rod.
