Subject: Re: [VB] Need 67 ignition sw - not repop

Andy,
That sounds great - It looks like I've got a switch from Clara, and once I
get it, I can send it and my spare ign key to Gabe or Steve below.

Thanks!

&gt; Give Gabriel a call.  He's pretty much THE key guy.  Just tell him you've
&gt; got a '67 bus and give him a key code.  He probably has an NOS ignition he
&gt; can sell you, and will rekey it to match your bus.  His number is
&gt; 209-462-2851.  I had him rekey an NOS ignition for my bus and make a spare
&gt; set of keys for me.  They work great.
