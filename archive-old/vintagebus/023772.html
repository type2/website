&gt;  We have had more than a few customers who wanted us to install 3 point
&gt; belts in their buses. It can be done fairly easily but you will
&gt; definitely have to do or have some welding done.

&gt; down your weld and you're in business.

IMHO this is a really bad idea. These pillars were never meant to
support this kind of attachment, and will not hold the force of a human
body being thrust against it in an accident. Take a look at the
placement of the original seatbelt bolts, and the bolts themselves.
Beefy. False security and a damaged bus is what you get with such a
weld-in contraption. 

Better seatbelts in a splitty, by my thinking, is kinda like worrying
about the toilet overflowing in the house just downstream of the Hoover
damn. (Bob builds a helluva damn!) Good brakes in optimum adjustment, a
really good following distance, and a sharp cautious eye will help to
insure you never need to test those lap belts. 

If you are going to get carried away you could install later high-back
seats, a 5mph super-beetle front bumber, or, better yet, admit that you
are not a splitty person at heart and go buy the latest hunk of Detroit
steel. 

Hows that for a friendly flame?
