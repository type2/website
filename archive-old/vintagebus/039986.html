Subject: Re: [VB] 67 Front Striker plates?

Hey All,

I've got some 67 doors waitin to go on my 66.  Should I anticipate major 
probs regarding striker plates.  Will 67 doors not mate up w/ 66 striker 
plates?  I believe I have the 67 strikers as well, will they not bolt into 
by B pillars?  Just curious of what kind of probs I'm gonna incounter.  I 
assumed 65-67 doors were the same.

Thanks,

Eric
