We (the list) could make one!  (Probably not in time for Christmas, knowing
printing companies, but maybe for next year!?)

Also...we (the list) could put together a video of various buses with their
various owners doing things to, in, and around them....anyone with a video
editing station?  People could create &quot;articles&quot; on video...various
bus-related subjects, from fun to technical how-tos, and then they could be
woven together to make a special video (or series) that not only would we
enjoy, but people would probably actually pay for them at swaps/various
online sources, etc.

Shut me up if I'm waxing geeky!

&gt; Does anyone know of a calendar with only bues in it?...........There has
&gt; to be one out there some where.  Thanks in advance.
