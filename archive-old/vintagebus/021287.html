I ordered one of these but have not tried it.  If anyone wants sources:
Eastwood #5261 $10 800-345-1178
Harbor Freight # 03168-3RTA $3 800-423-2567
Northern Hydraulics #109520 $110 [not a typo] 800-533-5545 (This is for use
with air powered lubrication euquipment)
There are no doubt local sources for each of you.    I saw one at Sears, but
it was not a Craftsman and not in the catalog.  I think it was all plastic
(ie. white nylon).

PS.  I still need info on Rust-Mort and Muratic Acid.  Got CLR and
electrolysis covered. Also any rust treatment anecdotes appreciated.
