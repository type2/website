Subject: Re: [VB] re:copper or steel brake lines

The bearer of bad news is here ............. brake lines are steel for a
reason.
#1) They are 1/8&quot; , 3/16&quot; whatever. But they are actually rolled from a
band of steel that is .010 and 2&quot; or more wide, in other words they are
many layers wrapped. 
I've seen recent lines that are single ply seem welded, they tend to
split when you bend them.
#2) They have a double flare on the ends.
Brake lines last a long time ....  try to get the right parts.
The Sorry Britts put the brake lines under the battery on my MG Midget
and nearly killed me.
But I didn't have a wreck or die so I just thank common sense that I
mover the lines over the battery when I replaced them. 
Damn thing still wouldn't stop worth a crap. 
My reason for selling it after 12 years. 
Drive it slow or leave it at home.

for copper lines-they must have been referring to copper lined, as copper
does not rust, but the base or core is probably steel.
