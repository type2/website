Subject: Re: [VB] color issue

Pearl White was the typical white.  There was also a color called 
&quot;Silver White&quot; or &quot;Silberwiess&quot; (sp?) that was used on some areas
like the bumper and rim faces.

You could try out your color combination on the &quot;bus selecta&quot;.
Just google for it - it's pretty handy for color combination testing.
