Well I've trouble shot more problems on Daisy and managed to solve them all
one right after the other.  Bus electricals are the easiest to diagnose
compared to all of the other vehicles I've had to work on - inluding bugs!
Anyway, I traced the hi/lo beam problem to the fuse box (corrosion.)  I had
power to the box but nothing coming out.  Thom Fitz sure deserves a spot in
the history books because the schematic that I downed from his page has made
working on this bus a piece of cake.  Thanks a million Thom!  I was also
able to diagnose the cabin light problem due in part to my not realizing
that the switch only controls the rear light and the rear light switch
wasn't making contact between both pieces of metal.  A little tweak with the
needle nose pliers was all it took to fix that problem.

Next was the horn.  The big old 6v bomb was rusted pretty bad and of course
didn't work when supplied with 12v.  I put on a good used bug horn and ran a
new wire from the horn button down to the horn.  With my brother supplying
some push button action on the horn, I was able to get the horn tuned to
maximum loudness.  Now Daisy is really talking to me. :-)

All I have left to do is to see if the brake lights work and then I will
have confirmed that everything works (sans clock and fuel guage.)

Thanks for reading.
