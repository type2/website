&gt; I want to know if anybody on this dead list has put synthetic gear oil

&gt; slight whine at about 50 mph. It's a fresh rebuild, so I'm not pulling
&gt; it. At least not until I have a better reason than a little noise.

I put MT-90 in my gearbox (the last one produced by a list pariah) and it
whines a bit.  I don't remember if it whined with sta-lube in it.
