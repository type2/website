When looking for post 64 rear drums there are 3 manufacturers of these
drums, there are some real crap mexican ones, you can tell by the blue paint
on them and some good Mexican ones and if you or I get lucky my suppliers
will bring in some Beautiful Brazilian ones, these are/or must be made from
German molds as they are excellent, when compared to a real German drum you
would be hard pressed to tell the difference. If anybody on the list is
interested in these I can put on the search mode and get some more of these
in. The same goes for the post 64 fronts, but beware as a lot of vendors
will pass on a 68-70 front drum, these do work but you must use a different
front seal.

&gt; &gt; Well... after just 5 1/2 hours of filing and sanding the splines on the
&gt; &gt; drum, I got it on. Now I just have one more to do.....
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; 5.5 hours of work to get &quot;NOS&quot;  brake drums to fit???  Were these from
&gt; Wolfsburg West? Why not send them back and make them pay the shipping?

Not NOS, Mexican... from BFY. I would certainly advise anyone looking for
rear brake drums to hunt down some NOS and avoid the nightmare that
getting Mex. part number 2591 drums to fit is.....
