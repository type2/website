Subject: Re: [VB] 53 bus Wheel Cylinder needed

The rears on a 53 bus are the same as the front wheel cylinders on an oval 
window bug- and readly available.   

The front are barndoor bus only, so you have to hit up the vintage perverts. 
You can try the VW parts houses.  I found NOS ones when I got my 53.  The 
nice thing is the rebuild kits for the fronts are the same as a 69 bug- might 
have to double check that, but if you go ask for a rebuild kit for a 69 bug 
front, you are more likely to get it than if you ask for a 53 bus front 
rebuild kit.

Keep your brake system flushed so you don't get pitting!
