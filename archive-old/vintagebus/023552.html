&lt;&lt; My question is where are the #s stamped at? &gt;&gt;
Hi Bryan,
If you mean the chassi # it should be the sheet metal in the engine
compartment near the battery.  Look where the rear apron meets the engine
compartment sheet metal at a diagnial and there is the stamped chassi # on
the compartment side.
