Just gotta tell someone about the awesome fix I made
on the bus today. You know how great it feels when you
sucessfully troubleshoot? Aww man!

Anyway, yesterday was the first time I took DARTHVW
out on the road. History was: PO bought it in 92 with
good intent to restore, gathered some parts, etc. but
it became too much, so I bought it, trucked it from
Wyoming to So Cal (lucky me to live here). But before
'92 I guess it had an 80's re-do (black deluxe trim
and dash? YUCK!) and sat outside with no windows for a
couple of years (the horror). Anyway, much of the bus
is a big question mark since the PO only drove it once
a month for the past 2 years. But it had lots of extra
parts and potential.

So taking it on the road was an adventure to say the
least. Especially since trying the turn signal blew a
fuse, and pulling on the emergency lights blew the
other 16A fuse. So I'm driving her with no brake
lights, signals, hazards or horn. (still, I got lots
of kudos from the folks at the office and two teenage
cooks at the SHACK burger place in Marina Del Rey)

Anyway, I'm trying to get down to OCTOfest tomorrow,
and it wopuld be nice to have signals and brake lights
on the way down, so I thought I'd take a crack at the
electrical with nothing but Thom's page's 67 wiring
diagram in my hand.

So, I find in a box which came with the bus the
instructions for the Wolfsburg West blinker box
replacement and I figure out that one diode on the
thing was touching sheet metal when that is a no-no.
So I got that re-mounted with a piece of rubber inner
tube as a backing plate 
I also overhauled the talight assemblies (many years
ago, during one of the Maaco paint gigs, they painted
the gaskets and the insides of the housings) so I
sprayed &quot;chrome&quot; paint in there to get some bulb
reflection. 
Ran a new horn wire up the steering column.
I even found a good cond. dome light sitting in the
box, put that in the back, (got the 5W bulbs at PEP
BOYS) and
I'm proud to say that the bus is 

100% electrically operational!

Feels really good. Even the license plate light works.


So, I'm just feeling the love right now. 
This list is great. 
There are plenty of things you can do with an
afternoon and some common sense.

I'm gonna take some digipics at OCTO. I''ll post a
link.

Let's hope she makes it.

eventually ex-DARTHVW, electrical working for now.
