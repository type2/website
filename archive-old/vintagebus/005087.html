2 years after the move and countless hours of reorganizing, I've finally got
our little garage down to a compact and well organized little shop.  No
vehicles can be worked on within its confines but at least now I've got
tools and I know where stuff is at so I can actually work on stuff.  I
kicked off the newfound freedoms by working on getting a set of 15&quot; 5 lug
rims prepped for sandblasting.  I used a punch and marked the center of each
rivet of each rim from the backside - a total of 25 times.  Several drill
bits later I had drilled them all out.  Some clips were okay and others were
not but I drilled them all out - and a good thing I did too - rust was
forming behind all 25 clips!  Here's a tip - when drilling out hubcap clip
rivets, you don't have to drill clear thru - only enough to brake or soften
the lip that actually holds the clip in place.  This equates to drilling
down only about a sixteenth of an inch, flipping the rim over, and using a
flat blade of an old chisel, prying out the old clip/rivet combo.  It leaves
a nicer hole in the him and saves you time from having to drill any more
material than what's absolutely necessary.

One of rims is going to be a finger crossing situation - it was one that I
brought back from Hiawatha, KS with the tire still on it.  I cut the tire
off with a wood saw (and found a tube in it!) and saw a ton of rust.  The
rim might be salvageable but we'll see - I currently have it in the
electrolysis tank outside.  I've tried this for the first time.  Wondering
what I'm talking about?  Check this page out:

I set up a big old plastic tote and suspended the rim in the middle of it.
Then, following the directions on the web page mentioned above, I added
water, iron rods, salt, laundry soda, and a battery charger.  Almost
immediately after powering up the charger, I saw a stream of bubbles coming
off from the rim.  Within an hour, the water had a brownish tint.  I'm
leaving the whole shebang run all night outside - if I shell the rim, oh
well - I'll find another but I'm hopeful that with this technique, I can
pull off the deep rust and let the powdercoating fill up some of the pitting
on the bead.  Before closing shop for the night, it appeared that a thin
layer material was forming on the rods in the tank.  So far so good!

I'll continue to keep you all posted.  Thanks for reading.
