Got this email on my web site today, please respond to him:
&gt;
I will be taking a vacation in the San Francisco Area (Gurnerville)
around my 40th birthday on September 9.  The worst thing about being on
vacation out there is I will be without my 65 bus!  (I hate to drive an
Avis)  I would very much like to rent a decent old 67 or earlier from
someone in the area for a few days.  Just like my bus it will be loved
and taken care of.  Please let me know if you have any interest.  We can
work something out.
