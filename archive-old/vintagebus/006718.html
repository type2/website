There are 5 different carbs available for the type 1 engines made by 2
different manufacturers

1.  30 PICT 1 manual choke  Bocar	
2.  30 PICT 1 electric choke Borosol
3.  30/31 pict 1 universal (comes with adapter to convert wide base to
narrow base) Borosol
4. 34 PICT 3 wide base Bocar
5. 34 PICT 3 K-Cal wide base with extra arm for Cali. smog cars

All of these are avaiable and cost from 99.99 to 159.99

I prefer the 30 PICT 1 manual or electric but stay away from the 30/31 as
they use different jets and use 2 pilot jets or the 34 pict 3, east to
rejet. I have 25 different size jats for these, 5 different pilot jets, so
making the 30 PICT 1 or the 34 PICT 3 work is easy.

ps. I had a good conversation with Boston Bob at the Classic and we talked a
lot about carbs, the oddball engines I build etc. If you go to his web site
there are tech articals on carbs and how to get rid of the flat spot with
the 34 PICT 3 carb and 009 dizzy combo without useing a new fangled dizzy.

Split List, George, 

Back on Sat, 29 May 1999, George Lyle asked &quot;Now, is there a source for new 
30PICT-1 carbs?  I mean the real thing, not the &quot;31PICT-3&quot; fits-all carbs 
(with the air screw) that everyone is selling these days. I like the -1
carb, 
as it is very easy to set up and seems to hold its settings much better than

the air-bypass-screw smog carbs.&quot;

It looks like Wolsburg West has something they call &quot;30PICT-1&quot; at:
http://www.wolfsburgwest_dot_com/cgi-bin/wwshowpn.cgi?PN=113129027h
These look like the real (SA) thing for $140, but I have not asked WW about 
them yet. 

CA Imports has something very similar for $100 they call &quot;30/31 PICT&quot; (poor 
photography) at:
http://www.vwcalimports_dot_com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=cal
i&amp;
Product_Code=VWC-113-129-027H&amp;Category_Code=S02

RMMW has something similar for $110 but with a manual choke called a &quot;Solex 
H-30-PIC&quot; at:
http://www.motorworks_dot_com/aircooled/cgi-bin/sgin0101.exe?FNM=00&amp;T1=113+129+0

BR&amp;UID=2000062016492601&amp;UREQA=3

WW also has something that looks like the 34pict-3, but they call it 
&quot;30PICT-2, 31PICT-1&quot; for $125 at: 
http://www.wolfsburgwest_dot_com/cgi-bin/wwshowpn.cgi?PN=113129027k
but this has to be a mis-lable since WWW also has a &quot;34PICT-3&quot; for $179 at:
http://www.wolfsburgwest_dot_com/cgi-bin/wwshowpn.cgi?PN=113129031K
but then again, maybe the only difference is that the &quot;30PICT-2, 31PICT-1&quot; 
fits a SP manifold but works like a 34pict-3 (ie has bypass idle circuit).

Okay Tom, WHY ARE YOU CALLING? ---

I am in need of a carb for my pretty much stock and new Boston Bob Engine 
1600DP long block (50mph/reliable/blue highways).  I have done some
homework, 
browsed through 550 &quot;pict&quot; results from the archive, etc...  I am strongly 
leaning to a single vacuum line distributor (vacuum advance only) per Hoover

and others recommendations to stay away from the pop riveted 009 in busses.

I would also like to stay away from the 30/4 pict-3 carbs with the idle 
bypass.  I have always used the pict-3, and am ready to give the suggested 
easier/steadier/reliable pict-1/2 is easier a try.  So I figured that the 30

pict-2 with a DP adapter would be the logical choice since it was used on
the 
&quot;B&quot; 1600 SP 1968-69 engines.  The only difference (besides jet sizes)
between 
the 30 pict-1 and 30 pict-2 seems to be the &quot;power fuel&quot; circuit which seems

to work under vacuum to discharge gas directly from the bowl to a location 
ABOVE/BEFORE the choke.  This &quot;power fuel&quot; circuit was also in the 28 pict.

So I guess I only have one basic (subjective) question:
1. Is the difference between the 30 pict-1 and 30 pict-2 significant on a 
1600 DP?

which has many follow up questions:
2. What are folks experience's with the 30 pict-1 on a 1600 DP?
3. If finding a quality rebuilt 30 pict-2 is tricky (although I have not 
started looking yet), is it worth over getting a NEW 30 pict-1?
4. What are folks experience with the NEW 30 pict-1 (not the 31PICT-3 or 
similar name carb with idle bypass).  Do these have the improved plug that 
falls out of the throat like the 30/4 pict-3?
5. Besides BFY, anyone know of quality carb rebuilders who do the throttle 
bushing also?
6.  Am I way too picky?

I will post a summary of any pmail responses to the list
