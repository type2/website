When I was at the SEMA show there was a supplier that has the european style
1 piece recievers in 1 7/8 qnd 2 inch sizes besides the metric, this way you
could make the hitch with the correct style ball! Was thinking if doing
these, it would be easy but the liability would be horendous. I would have
to have a release from whoever purchased these to release Old Volks from all
liability, thats why I don't make tow bars. All products I sell are covered
by suppliers or manufacturers product liability insurance.
