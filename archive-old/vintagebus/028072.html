&gt; &quot;I too dont know how to proceed. All I know is that I am going to drive it
&gt; every day (smiles feel pretty darned good) and keep plugging away at
&gt; mechanicals.  I guess that if the right price comes around, I'll sell it and
&gt; move on to another VW (Things look like alot of fun; a camper is something
&gt; else I would like to work on as well).
&gt;
&gt; Oh, and I am playing the lottery every week as well.  I could then quit my
&gt; job and move to a double-wide trailer with a 7bay garage located in the
&gt; middle of nowhere.  Then I would have time to try body work on the '67 while
&gt; driving a Thing to the parts store.&quot;

I just bought a show quality Thing. It is great! I have to admit I had as much fun
with my POS red Thing with the nose bashed in. I could let the kids play on it. I
could drill holes in it (for speakers, spare tire carriers etc...). Do not under
estimate the value of a very useable bus / vehicle. If it crosses the line into
the realm of too nice, there is a lot more pressure. I still drive the Thing
everyday. My kids ride in it and it gets parked out side a lot. I believe in using
a car. I guess my point is use it and enjoy it. Things will work out and it will
get fixed up in due time. So it takes you 10 yrs. My 60 Double Cab is on the 10
year restoration schedule. By the way I do live in a double wide in the middle of
nowhere and am drawing plans for a 1200 square foot shop/garage. I drive the Thing
to the parts store to get parts for the Double Cab. It is all you think it is. (Of
course we will be living in the garage and renting out the double wide until we
can afford to build the house, but it sounds better the other way.
Be patient and enjoy!
