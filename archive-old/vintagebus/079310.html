Subject: Re: [VB] Bus Dead

I second that.   In my 67 riviera I can't use the emergency lights... if I do 
a fuse blows... the nose is dented (PO had a challenged sense of the size and 
shape of the bus) and the wires are pinched in there.   Then again, follow 
the wires... you should have power from the big wire at the right hadn fuse... 
do you have a wireing diagram?

&gt; My bus took a minor hit to the front end yesterday. Enough to dent the 
license
&gt; plate as someone was backing up and didn't see me.
&gt; The engine stalled when I was hit and now everything is dead. I turn the key
&gt; and nothing happens, no click, or anything else.
&gt; Anybody know what to look for?
&gt; I have no lights, or ignition or any electrical function.
&gt; thanks in advance

the electrical harness may be pinched. it comes up through the frame right
at the nose.
