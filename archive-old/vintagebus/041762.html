Subject: Brake Fade / Steep Grade
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.05.10007062246270.89081-100000_at_lenti.type2_dot_com&gt;

Seems like more than one person was correct about the brake fade.
Also the official word on braking on a grade.

Quoted from the Commercial DL Test...

3h. Describe the proper braking technique when going down a
long steep downgrade?

1. Apply the brakes just hard enough to feel a definite slowdown. 
2. When your speed has been reduced to
approximately 5 mph below your &quot;safe&quot; speed, release the
brakes. This should last for about 3 seconds. 
3. When your speed has increased to your &quot;safe&quot; speed, repeat 
steps 1 and 2.

If your &quot;safe&quot; speed is 40 mph, you would not apply your
brakes until your speed reaches 40 mph. You would now apply
the brakes hard enough to gradually reduce your speed down
to 35 mph and then release the brakes. You repeat this as
often as necessary until you have reached the end of the
downgrade.


2p. What factors can cause brakes to fade or fail?

Excessive use of the service brake causes overheating and
leads to brake fade. Brake fade results from excessive heat
causing chemical changes in the brake linings making the
linings hard and brittle which reduce the friction and also
causes expansion of the brake drums.

As the overheated drums expand, the brake shoes and linings
have to move farther to make contact with the drums, and the
force of this contact is greatly reduced.

Brake fade is also affected by adjustment. To safely control
a vehicle, every brake must be properly adjusted to do its
share of work.

When brakes are out of adjustment, this leaves the braking
to be done by the brakes that are in proper adjustment and
causes the properly adjusted brakes to overheat.

3p. The use of brakes on a long steep downgrade is only a
supplement to the braking effect of the engine. True or
False?

TRUE. Once the vehicle is in the proper low gear, the proper
braking technique is to apply the brakes just hard enough to
feel a definate slowdown.

When your speed has been reduced to about 5 mph below your
&quot;safe&quot; speed, release the brakes. This application should
last for about 3 seconds.

When your speed has increased to your &quot;safe&quot; speed, repeat
the braking process.
