I have a Pertronix on my dual vacuum advance on my 71 bus.  Make sure you get 
a pertronix for a vacuum advance.  It fits.

&gt; &gt;I'm planning on installing a Pertronix ignition in the new dist, does

&gt; I thought you could only put a Pertronix in an 009?  Don't know for
&gt; sure.  You might look at both kinds of distributors to see what kind
&gt; of room you have - it seems to me like the dual advance with two
&gt; rods coming from two vacuum cans would have less room to install a
&gt; Pertronix, which is a little bigger than a set of points.
