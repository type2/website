Subject: radio shaft adjustment distance

I found an old working JVC cassette player with adjustable shafts in my
junk collection today.  Before I go out and remove my block -off plate
from my dash, does anyone know off-hand what the distance is? There is a
chart on the top of the radio that lists 148, 140, and 130mm distances.
(5 13/16, 5 1/2, and 5 1/8)  5 1/8 seems to ring a bell, does that sound
right?

I really hope so because it is just outdated enough as to (hopefully)
make it undesirable to steal, and has pre amp outputs to add the working
alpine amp that I found when i cleaned the bus out.  Remove speakers
from busted boom box, and I might have a stereo system that cost 0$, and
I will not have mangled anything in the bus to do it!
