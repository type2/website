you know how I've always said I'm a commercial type of guy, but with the
panel going bye bye and going to sell my 66 hardtop deluxe walkthrough, that
only leaves me with one driver (60 DD) so off I go and bye 2 more buses, I
mentioned the 59/60 34,000 mile single cab, well I just bought a 1954
Barndoor Deluxe, pretty complete but needs rockers, left dogleg and some
other stuff, I will be off on a major road trip next weekend to pick it up,
any body want to go on a major roadtrip next weekend? Will be gone 3-4 days
depending on how far I can drive a day, can delivery a bus in route if
someone needs something going east, p mail me if interested.

ronnie  old volks (really old now) of az.
