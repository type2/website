If I can get my DC back together and road worthy, it'll be the second brightest Type 2 at KPark. As for meeting, how about a couple of times, say 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. at Thom's yellow panel? If the VintageBus domain is down, meet at my orange/yellow doublecab, same times. If there's any better suggestions, let's hear 'em. 

Just  tracked down a lead on another split DC. Supposed to be stock and well cared for. I plan on yanking the ICE (internal combustion engine) components and moving the electric stuff from my '74 Thing to it. A DC can carry more batteries to extend the range, and I like driving Type 2's. Just as the Thing was uncut for the EV conversion, the DC will remain stock. Gas for distance, EV for in town. Currently, energy costs for my EV is under 3 cents/mile. It's 7.5 cents/mile for gas in a 24mpg vehicle at $1.80/gal.
