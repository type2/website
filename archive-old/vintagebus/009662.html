&gt;I have seen this camper Bus and it is the tomato red and white.  It has
&gt;the unusual side tilting hatch tho, not the straight pop up type.  It is a
&gt;non walk thru and is very unique in the interior and totally original.
&gt;Very nice indeed.  The sheet metal work that is always in need of being
&gt;done has already been done and it has been done extremely well.  This Bus
&gt;is a driver.
&gt;I offered him $5K for it last year and he hemmed and hawed about selling
&gt;it.  Had I not bought the '66 Westy I have now, I wouldn't hesitate to get
&gt;this Bus.  He lives up in Granite Falls WA.
&gt;I would be willing to bet he takes it to the Puyallup swap end of the
&gt;month, but not positive.
&gt;later
