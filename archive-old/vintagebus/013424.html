hey all-

would prefer to send the following to good homes rather than the local scrap
metal dealer

1. heater tube thingie that normally is featured in standards and deluxes. it
is the metal tube that sits just in front of the engine bulkhead and welded to
the floor. it has surface rust but is undented and complete in pretty decent
shape from a 60 deluxe

2. complete unhacked bulkhead from 62 euro kombi. from door to door and from
floor to top. this is for all of you that have had your bulkhead hacked by
people with overzealous sawzall's etc.


i am not looking to make money on these (or lose money for that matter
either). if interested contact via p-mail. sorry but have to ask for $ upfront
before i ship these things.

i am in toronto, ontario
