Hi Steve,
You really do not need an idle shut off jet.  The plain old pilot jet will do 
just fine.  Best thing first always is to take apart the carb and thoughly 
clean it!  Put it back together and warm the engine about 15 minutes.  Then 
install a very small main jet to make sure it does not overshadow the idle 
circuit with too much fuel output.  Then experiment with larger and smaller 
idle jets till you can not only get it to idle but have the fuel/air mixture 
screw function also that it affects the idle when turned toward all the way 
in.  In other words if you turn the fuel air mixture screw all the way in and 
it does not slow the engine down RPM wise the pilot jet is most likely way 
too big.  Once you have the pilot jet properly sized then experiment with 
differant main jet sizes till you get the engine to accelerate without 
bogging down which can be cause by too much fuel or too little!   Lastly at 
high RPMs the air correction jet goes to work.  Just install bigger and 
bigger sized air correction jets until the engine tends to cough and/or ping 
at high RPMs (2,500-3,000 RPM) then just decrease this jet size a size or 
two.  
Do not trust the jet sizing numbers stamped in the jets even new they can be 
off a size and used results in who knows all too often.  Get a jet sizing 
tool to check all your jets.  Eric&amp;Barb
