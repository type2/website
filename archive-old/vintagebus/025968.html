Wow, how appropriate to my day!  I had something similar happen just today.
Although not exactly the same, it does show how unethical many people are in
our society today.  My story revolves around a very straight and rust free DC
that was at Pomona yesterday.  I was dealing with the person who brought the
truck to the swap, but was not the owner, and was not prepared to give a
definitive yes or no response to a legitimate cash offer (first red flag!).  I
looked at the truck and made an offer and emphatically stated I did want the
truck.  I went on my way expecting a phone call from the real owner.

There was another bidder unbeknownst to me yesterday.  The blasted owner
strung both of us along making each other bid higher.  Ebay's got nothing on
this guy!  The whole mess culminated in a f'ing 3 way conference call between
the other bidder, the owner and myself.  I couldn't even believe it was
happening!  The owner was trying to have to two of us bid each other as high
as he could.  His original price was 3K.  I originally offered the proxy (the
duffus &quot;selling&quot; the truck at Pomona) 2K with the condition that I WANTED the
truck wanted to deal with the owner who had the final say so who wasn't
there.  After many calls I finally got the proxy on the phone and he told me
someone offered $2300.  &quot;OK&quot;, I said &quot;I'll match that&quot;.  This went on back and
forth till this afternoon when the 3 way call happened.

The end result is that the other bidder and myself stalled at 3K (the original
asking price) and no
more.  I felt that since I was the first to see the truck and make a
legitimate offer that all things being equal as far as price goes, the person
who saw it first and made the first bid should get it.  What do you think??

The final result was that we actually picked a # between 1 and 50...I picked
badly (crap).  Oh well.  In retrospect, I should have gone higher.  But at
that point, I felt like a puppet and was sick of being manipulated.  Like they
say, there's always another car...I hope.

This is just a small example of people not doing what is &quot;right&quot; and of the
lack of ethics in our society.  Believe me its not just in buying VWs.  If I
were the &quot;other&quot; bidder, I would have conceded that the person who saw the bus
or part for that matter deserves the first right of refusal.
