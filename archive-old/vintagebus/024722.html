Subject: Friday Topic: Cold Weather Fun

Hi, all. All the cold weather topic reminded me of a stupid bus stunt I
pulled about 10 years ago. This tale has no redeeming value, so if you
expect much you'll probably want to move along.

I've posted about cold winters in Logan, UT, where I was a college
student. In one particular house, getting the Bus started (a '66) was
not a big deal, despite the 3 weeks or so of -20F morning temps. I then
had to get the Bus rolling up a very slight grade toward the street from
a dead stop on glare ice. My snow tires were not studded.

I was using sand and sawdust on the ice for traction, but melting and
refreezing overnight would often times thwart this effort. I could drive
the Bus off the ice only about half the time.

For those times that it failed, I would leave the Bus idling in 1st or
2nd gear, walk to the back of the Bus, and lever it forward with a 6'
pipe I kept against the fence for this purpose. Moving it forward 6&quot; or
12&quot; would cause it to gain traction and I could run up, get in the Bus,
and drive it out to the street (a relatively busy street at this time of
the morning).

One morning, I levered the Bus and got it going, only to have the rear
wheels start spinning again. I levered it one more time, it took off,
and I started running up to the front. Starting farther forward, though,
the driver's door was blocked by lilac bushes before I could get to it
(DOH!). The Bus passed me, and I grabbed onto the back bumper. As it
towed me toward the street traffic, I contemplated how I was going to
explain the inevitable collision with a car or house to the local
police.

As I'm staring at the back of the Bus, and feeling extremely stupid, it
occurred to me that the '66 has a push button engine cover! I was saved!
I popped open the engine cover with one hand (still hanging on the
bumper with the other) and yanked the power to the coil. I stopped just
shy of the sidewalk (WHEW!).

I looked over at the elderly neighbor snowblowing his driveway. He
thought I was a little odd, anyway. He was paused, snowblower churning
the crisp air, mouth hanging. I smiled and waved, having reconnected the
coil power, started the Bus and drove off (he still hadn't moved).

Have fun,
pd
