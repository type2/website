OK it's me with my questions again.  Could you folks look at the link below
and tell me if you think this would be a good price?  I think it's a touch
high for not being all original.  It's about 6 pictures, so it load kind of
slow for folks like me with a 56K connection.  I have a description of what
I know about it on the page.

Thanks
Dave
