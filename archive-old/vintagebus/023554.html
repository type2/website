I have a standard unmodified transmission and standard unmodified reduction

have a special trans made up with a higher ring gear ratio.

Hi All,

My original owners manual states a top gear of .82, ring and pinion of 4.125
and redux boxes at 1.26:1. The rear tire radius is 12.5&quot;.  Do the math and
it looks like 60 mph is 3439RPM, 70 mph is 4011 RPM and 80 mph is 4583 RPM.
And yes it will do 80 on the flat. ??? Am I doing something wrong other than
breaking speed limits? Let me know.

perhaps you should look in the archives about gear ratios...there is much
there   and I believe  that due to unreasonably heated argument re the best
rpms you run your motor at this may be a topic banned from the list.   Unless
you are 100% sure that is the original tranny, and even then, you may want to
put a tach on it even if barrowing one for a test) to see what rpms you do at
what speeds in what gears.    This may be interpolated into actual gearing
inside the tranny.    Overrevving can overheat a motor also increases wear
which reduces engine life, which is why some people want higher gear ratios.
especially those w/trannies w/ 4.37 R&amp;P and 1.39 RGears, ending in a 48ish
mph at 3K rpms.   while you may be able to push it to 70 or whatever the
gears etc will be spinning faster than optimal.   though better  power on
hills.    I find a 4.12 w/1.26 RGears very workable, though also find the
3.88w/1.26 nicer on long trips.    building a 3.88 tranny for a bus is more
complicated (read expensive) and I think someone was hoping there would be a
simpler  (cheaper) way to get higher gears w/o lowering the bus.       Try
lying in the back of the bus listening to the motor while a trusted friend
drives.   listen at different speeds.   find the sweet spot.    in my 61 I
had to listen real real hard to hear the motor at 3K, it was so sweet, above
3K I started hearing the motor (my head is right above it) at about 55 to 50
the tranny whine came out, and I think with all those tax moneys the state of
California could repave the roads and cut down on my road noise.
