Just curious, since I pulled the engine this afternoon to try and solve a 
shifting issue.  It's simple really: I press in the clutch, and I can shift
gears, but I have to wait what seems quite a while before I can engage gears.
Reverse is the most fun, I get a hearty Grrrrriiinnd if I go too fast!

I know some spin-down time is inevitable, but mine is taking a few seconds.  
Is this acceptable?  I've adjusted the clutch cable back and forth, and pulled
the engine today to be sure I had lubed the gland nut adequately.  My Kombi
never did stunts like this, but OTOH the Kombi didn't have a rebuilt tranny
either.

Shifting at speed is fine, it's while idling or into reverse that it's 
noticeable.  Idle speed is a cool 800, not like 2000 or anything.
