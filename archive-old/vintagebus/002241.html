Hi all-

I was studying an engine I had sitting in one corner of my basement for the
past few years, and starting thinking about what it had originally come out
of.  Though much research has been done, I still can't figure it out.  Any
help would be appreciated.  The engine code (found right below below the
carb) is E981053.  Thanks!
