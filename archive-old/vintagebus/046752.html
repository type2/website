I have been driving my 67 kombi up back and forth from San Diego to Phoenix 
for the last few years and I am wondering what amount of difference tire size 
has in the gearing on the freeway? Right now im running the stock 14s with 
185s. Should I be running like 205s or something? No one can seem to give me 
a straight answer.
