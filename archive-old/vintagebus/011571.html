[Subject: Hot August Nights - Reno]

Steve from SKL Enterprises wrote of his stay in Reno during the &quot;Hot
August Nights&quot; event in Reno Nevada and of the few VWs among the appx
10,000 show cars and custom hot rods that attend the five day
celebration of the &quot;Fifties and Sixties&quot; every August for the past
twelve years.
I would like to see a larger presence of VWs and would even offer to
all listees and VW Clubs to try to organize a VW meet, and cruise
during this huge celebration. 
If there is any interest in VW people getting together next year in an
organized fashion, please let me know.
Aside from that, any listee planning a trip to Reno and would like any
info on the area, please feel free to e-mail me.
E-mail me for more info....
