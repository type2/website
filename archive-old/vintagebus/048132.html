Subject: westfalia tent variations
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hey list,

      I have a westfalia tent that I am going to sell and needed some info.  
The tent I have is just like the one on Joe Clarks web page,  the one with 
two opening on the side for the bus.  It has like a window and then a big big 
curved opening for the bus entrance.
My question is what is a fair price for this tent it is in very good 
condition.  Has all the poles etc.  Are these tents and the ones with just a 
square opening for the bus for the same years?  Is one more desireable?

Thanks  , Jon
