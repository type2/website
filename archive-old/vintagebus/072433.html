Subject: Re: [VB] Hippies- One last clarification, it wasn't them!!

I don't qualify because there is no damn hair on my head. So I guess I

That simply makes you a New Wave Yuppie.
Every time I see twenty Harley Davidson going down the road driven by
Doctors, Lawyers, Real Estate Brokers, Stock Brokers (or others that can
afford $25K + motorcycle) I see at least one fully restored VW van of
some year following them with a supply of Beer, Bandages, Snacks and
whatever the new wave Harley crowd needs to support their trips.
