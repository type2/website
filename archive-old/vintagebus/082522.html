&gt;who cares about the bondo, its sill on the road, thats what matters. some 
&gt;of us want to drive our &gt; buses instead of having them in various states of 
&gt;restoration for 15 years never to move more    &gt; than 20 feet at a time.

It wont be on the road for long with no airflow to the left side of the 
engine ( left side using F is F method :) )
