Subject: re: [VB] some people have waay too much money 

Then on the other hand during the course of the nine years that I owned the '67
Westfalia I was unable to locate or accumulate a set of OG curtains. 'Was never
at the right place at the right time with the right money. I would have paid
that kind of money (at one point in time) to have found enough of that material
from either bay/splitty to create a set. Stupid me I passed on a chance to buy
&quot;only the whole bus-not parts&quot; a '66 westy with great curtains, complete with
engine for $300. back when because I didn't have a way to haul it home and
because it had rocker rust. CHA! I'd most definitely find a way now. hahaha
Lucky are the folks who have them. The L shaped what-not cabinet, the
floorless/removable floor tent and associated aluminum trim and the aluminum
trim from along the edge of the cargo door floor were the hardest to find.

Thanks to our existing vendors things like decent fitting body and interior
metal, interior poptop ceiling cutout edge trim, seat stand mats, front floor
mats, fisheye turn signal lenses and cardboard kick panel/doorpanel/ceiling
panels are easier to find. Previous to the repops these items commanded STUPID
money when they could be found. Support our vendors or we may be back into that
mode! =)
