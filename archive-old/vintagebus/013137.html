We would be glad to have you Dave.  The more slow buses the better.

Well Sunday (or Monday if a check doesn't come in the mail tomorrow) I 
will be headed to CA (with an achin' in my heart).  I'll be travelling 
smaller highways across GA &amp; AL to Memphis, TN where I will hop on I-40 
and drive, and drive, and drive...

I'm going out for the O.C.T.O. show &amp; the Classic if anyone along the 
I-40 corridor wants to hook up and caravan or get together for meal stops, 
etc..  I will be travelling in the 1954, so it will be a long s-l-o-w 
trip.

Hope to get to Phoenix for the barndoor caravan to the shows.

Wish me luck, and look for the hideous &quot;good 'ol boy Camaro teal&quot; '54 
Kombi at the shows.

Dave
