Subject: Re: [T2] New carb woes...

Same thing happened to me. I threw in a new fuel pump, lines and filter. All
starting and idling problems were solved. The new carb required more fuel
and the fuel pump was old and pushing less fuel. It wasn't noticable with
the old, smaller carb.

I'd do that before any complex re-bushing, tuning or replacing of electrical
parts.
