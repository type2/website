Well, 

Maybe it was just me, but I had a great weekend.  Yeah, it sucked being in a F'in horse corral, but the weather was great and lots of great bus photo ops back in town.  

With three people in the bus, it was only 5 bucks cheaper to park it outside so we went in.  I think we must have been the last to enter, cuz they tried to park us right in the middle of the walk way across from the WW booth.  I made an executive decision when I spied an open spot down by the OCTO bus next to the high roofs.  The parking situation did suck though.

I bought food from SVII guys, so we tried to support you guys.  Said hi to a few of the regulars and met a few listees.  Most were nice, with ONE notable exception.  Must have been really cranky about something...maybe it was the double saw buck the GG chapter sucked out of his pocket.  At least I can now put a face with a name...good to know for future reference.  I agree that the directions were NON EXISTENT.  No where on the flyer/website ect. were there directions to &quot;Buell&quot; arena.  I got up extra early just to drive around and find the place.  Some guy at the AM/PM pointed me in the right direction.  I went back and had breakfast with the family and then we went to the show about 8:30.

My truck ran perfect!  Never even opened the tool box.  We took 101 on the way up and the back way to Santa Barbara on the way home.  Nice drive, but the 40 mph we could muster on the way over the pass pissed a few SUV's off I'm sure.

All in all, we had a good weekend.  Yes, the show needs work...especially with regards to us bus people.  The setting and weather are the best, but they need better directions, and organization.  

One more thing.  When did the show become a VW/Porsche show...nice cars, but I thought it VVWCA event.  Last time I checked Porsches were not VW's.  Cousins maybe but they have their own shows.
