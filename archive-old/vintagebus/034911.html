 &lt;&lt; I left the vise-grips on the fuel line. &gt;&gt;
 
 Don't feel bad, NQ, around here, that is called &quot;A Gary Maneuver&quot;
  &gt;&gt;

The funny thing was when I read your description of the problem it sounded 
just like when I forgot to push the fuel shut off tap in all the way after 
leaving Eric&amp;Barb's place in my 61 (had gone there to pull the motor and 
reset the end play - I don't have a dial indicator).   It ran real funky, and 
halfway home I noticed the knob was halfway out- pushed it in and  voila!!!  
But you have a 67 I thought, and no fuel tap.
