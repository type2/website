My hunch would be your bolt is too long (I've never had that problem)
Either shorter bolts, or a washer if you don't have one in there already.
Don't *stack* washers to take of the space - that will cause other problems.

&gt; My 66 has a type III rear with a wolfgang swing axle kit (wishing for stock
&gt; right now). The brake backing plates (type III) are loose, the bolts don't
&gt; seem to tighten them down all the way. Does anyone know what might be the
&gt; trouble here? Am I out of hot h20 with just new backing plate bolts from a
&gt; type III&gt;?  I bought the bus this way, and assume the stock bus bolts were
&gt; used here.
