Subject: Heat riser insulators

OK.  I admit it, since its Friday night and I've posted 4 to 5
times..... I have NO life.

I do have a legitimate excuse in the form of two little ones and a wife
and...well you know the rest.   Even Ellis knows not to post on a Friday
NIGHT.

Anyway, the last post is a really NEEDED question.   Does anyone still
carry/make/repop the asbestos (or similar substance) heat riser
insulators that go inside the tin pieces that surround the intake
manifold heat risers on a SP engine??  I've checked with 3 or 4 local
VWFLAPS in Southern CA and no one even know what I'm talking about.  One
guy said the dealer had them, but that was 7 months ago.    What about a
good substitute that people use if you can't buy the right things??

Thanks.

Steve
