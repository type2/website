Erin posted that he recieved a call from Barrett and that everything seems
to be in the prtocess of being worked out.  Seems like they were very
apologic from what he said.

&gt; Listees,
&gt;
&gt;     Has anyone heard how Erin did in his dealings with B.E.? Just
wondering
&gt; whether to put B.E. on my &quot;black list.&quot; I'd ask Erin but last I heard he'd
&gt; signed off for a while.
