Subject: Re: [VB] I failed...

Looks like a fairly easy explanation, the creator of that dash liked his
71 so
much he installed the dash controls into his split.

I don't know how many owners have had this bus but I'm guessing I'm about
number ten.
The last two owners had it for over ten years each, then two years in
storage recently.
I'm not the kind of person that spends ten grand on restoring a Bus so
its not going to get any better looking sitting in my driveway.
I've been having a good time driving it but instead of people at red
lights saying &quot;What a cool bus&quot;, they say, &quot;look at that old hippie stuck
in the 60s&quot;.
