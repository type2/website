Hi Dworkin,
Main jet!  Which begins to work in the low RPMs just above idle, and goes 
from there on up in RPMs.  The bigger the more air/fuel allowed through from 
the air/fuel mixture screw.  Too small, or big of main jet will result in 
boggy acceleration from idle up.

&lt;&lt; - on the exterior right side, just below the parting line for the top of 
the carb, just behind the float bowl, a flat screw-like object with numbers 
stamped into the screw head&gt;&gt;
Pilot jet!  There is even one model of stock carb we know of that have two of 
these.  This/these keep the engine going at idle.  The bigger the size of 
hole the more fuel.  You really want a jet/s just big enough to keep the 
engine idling, and be able to fine tune the idle with the air/fule mixture 
screw on the left side of the carb.

 &lt;&lt;- suspended in the middle of the throat, a largish flat screw-like   
object with numbers stamped into the screw head&gt;&gt;
Air correction jet!  This actually allows air into the fuel/air mixture going 
to the main jet to keep the engine from running way to rich at high RPMs 
starting about 2,500 RPM.  The bigger the more air allowed in.

&lt;&lt; - using the previous one as the center of a clock, and the front of the 
carb being 12 o'clock, on the side of the throat at about 1:30 a smallish 
flat screw-like object with numbers stamped into the screw head &gt;&gt;
Hmm, nothing comes to mind with this description.  Do you have an image of 
this area?  Thanks,  Eric&amp;Barb
