No question on this end.  6 April 65.  The May date may have been the
day it left the plant and was shipped.  My '67 plate says 22 June, but
the birth certificate says 24 June.  It was picked up by the original
owner at Wolfsburg.

odd that the numbers are different.   The birth certificate sent to me for my 
53  has the production date an dthe delivery date, about 3 weeks separate 
them.   I though it was finished on the production date, and left the factory 
on the delivery date, but perhaps no?   perhaps it was STARTED on the 
production date?  How long does it take to build a bus?
..........................
In the NEATO Old Bus Registry, the last DD MM Y date on a production
plate is &quot;28 02 3&quot; (28 Feb 1963) for chassis number 1.069.028.  The
first DD M date is &quot;14 3&quot; (14 Mar 1963) for chassis number 1.077.847. 
My best guess is at the end of February 1963 VW changed the date code.

hm- no mention of this in my progressive refinements, though it does say when 
the m code tag was started, and when the tag was mved from the engine 
compartment.    It also lists on  6 March 1963 at chassis 1 080 104  the 
engine louvers went innie from outie ( the bus was no longer a baby!)   
anyway- that vin is later  than the bus you listed as being made 8 days 
afterwards.  Wonder if that 1 077 847 bus has innies or outies.   Probably 
outies.   And probably it was a deluxe or something that takes longer to 
make.  How's that for hypothetical thinking?
