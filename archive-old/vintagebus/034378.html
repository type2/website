Hi All,

Steve asks

	  &gt;Can I reuse the old push rods?  They are straight and look fine.

	They also need to be round and within spec or else they
	need to be resized (big end) and rebushed (piston pin).
	Can check by assembling and using plastiguage on the big end
	and making sure the piston pin is a tight interference fit.  Resized
and
	rebushed rods that are balanced end-to-end are cheap changeovers 
	in the States? (do need a reputable rebuilder though)  

	&gt;Do I use sealant on the oil cooler seals?

	Nope

	&gt;Do I need to use the gaskets that originally came under barrels?  I
was
	told by the VW flaps to just use RTV.

	Can go either way.  Gaskets and sealer, or just sealer.  Remember to
check
	your deck height...were gaskets or shims under your barrels?

	&gt;Do I need to use sealer on the cylinder head nuts that are in the
valve
	gallery?

	Yep

	&gt;Is Pomona next Sunday??

	???????? hmmm...dunno......8-)
