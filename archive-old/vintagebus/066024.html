Subject: RE: [VB] RE: Dual circuit master cylinders

Sounds good, but I don't think it has any application in reality. I had a
22mm M/C on my 67 SC and then went to the 24mm late mode M/C with adapter
plate and I would never go back to the smaller M/C again. Volume and
pressure in my book equals stopping power. And it feels right. Dynamic
testing of ideas, now that's action !

Hi,

If you push with 10lb against 1 sq inch, that 1 sq inch will have to press
back with 10lb/sq inch. If you push with 10lb against 1/2sq inch, that 1/2
sq inch will also have to press back against your 10lb with 10lb, but the
pressure built up will have to double so that you have 20lb per sq inch of
pressure behind that 1/2 sq inch to develop 10lb to counteract your 10lb.

Therefore, a smaller diameter cylinder will produce higher hydraulic
pressure than a larger cylinder given the same foot pressure applied.

If you read it real fast, it works.
And thanks to John Y.
