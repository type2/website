Subject: 65 new trans/one more time

Last time I installed my new trans, I couldn't get it to shift gears and I was leaking gear oil.

1. didn't know the paper shims between the axle tube ring and the trans case needed sealant. Okay, rookie manuever #1. I bought a caulking gun size tube of permatex blue silicone #6XX.

2. checked out the nosecone last night. I was able to activate each gear, one by one manually by pulling/pushing the sliders. I had them set up properly the first time. this means there's something in the linkage, either my mistake or maybe it's just so sloppy with age that it lacks the torque to move this tight new trans around.

point is, I feel like the same thing's gonna happen when I put it in the bus again. any thoughts?

I'm using the existing shift rod coupler, gear shift lever/linkage, I have a new front bushing to install, new trans, new trans mounts front and rear.

Help!
