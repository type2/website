Subject: Stepping Down From the Club
To: VintageBus_at_type2_dot_com

Well i would like to thank everyone on the list that has supported me and the 
club.  Due to personal and financial problems I am forced to step down from 
the presidency.  I will be helping the club out still as time permits but 
will no longer be on the board.  All questions or anything else regarding the 
club should be directed to Steve Martinez at Volken67_at_aol_dot_com.  Thanks to 
everyone, especially &quot;Uncle&quot; Jerry!
