I was trying to keep my post simple and brief :)

Frankly, the application that came to mind was to mount a pair of these
inside the lower corners of the rear hatch window, and wire them to operate
with the existing brake and turn signal circuits.  The current draw is so
low I expect this arrangement would work OK with the stock flasher unit.

If it worked out, it would certainly solve the problem of following vehicles
not seeing the stock brake and turn signal lights.

Alternatively, it might be possible to use these [hatch window mounted] LED
units as the only brake and turn signal lights, and redo the stock
taillights to use a much brighter bulb.

FWIW

&gt;&gt;  You didn't mention that it also comes with two mounting options: a
couple of strong magnets, or a &quot;sliding bracket&quot; for free-standing
operation.  &lt;&lt;
