Greetings all
I'm looking for any info on westy so-44 option, from what I understand this
was mostly only offered in Canada and Germany.
Looking for any pics or info especially any that relates to bay windows.
My 69 westy bench model appears to have originally come with this option(yes
it was German delivered)
Missing all camp gear so any help greatly appreciated!
Chuck
69 &amp; 70 westies
