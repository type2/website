Subject: bearings for RGBs- source

Well, those  huge bearings I was looking to swap a while ago actually got
swapped - for  2 full sets of RGBs!
Since I traded straight out, I don't know what their retail price was, but
the fine folks at
Alliance Bearing  800 423 9000 in Van Nuys
 had   &gt;SKF&lt; bearings in the needed sizes ((4) 6306, (2) 6305, and (2)
N207E, C3 fit).
They had some NTN as well - supposedly finest in the world, but I only knew
SKF Germany was safe... did I mess up by going German as opposed to the
Japanese?


I know Ronnie and others had priced sets at around $99 a side, call
Alliance and ask for Glenn and say I sent ya...
Mebbee Ronnie can get us a volume deal?
