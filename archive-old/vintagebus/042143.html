&gt; &gt;That being said, I have found that NAPA is REAL good about having parts 
&gt; &gt;other guys don't. But usually the price will reflect it.
&gt; 
&gt; They can be proud of their stuff but it usually tends to be good stuff.
&gt; It's hard to give any absolutes, but the NAPA stuff *usually* tends to
&gt; be the decent made-in-USA/Canada/Germany stuff instead of the 
&gt; made-in-China/Taiwan/Outer Elbonia stuff you get elsewhere.

Well, the last outer front wheel bearing I bought there was Mexican.
Seems to work fine, though.  I think that most of the major manufacturers
of bearings do pretty good quality control no matter where they are
building their parts.
 
&gt; &gt; Another thing is that at most NAPA stores, the guy punching up your
&gt; order has more control than you might think over what the bottom
&gt; line is going to be.  Once you've been shopping there for a while,
&gt; you may find that the prices come down somewhat.  Being nice to the
&gt; counter guy is also a factor here.  :)

Being nice costs no more!
