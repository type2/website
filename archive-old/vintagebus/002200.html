OK, I should have waited for Friday on this one but the timing is right....
just got this from a friend...

&gt;in regards to &gt; Youre offering your wife for a pair of handles. Oh Uncle
Jerry......

This chain letter was started in hopes of bringing relief to other tired
and discouraged men.  Unlike most chain letters, this one does not cost
anything.  Just send a copy of this letter to five of your friends who are
equally tired and discontented.

Then, bundle up your wife or girlfriend and send her to the man
whose name appears at the top of the following list, remove his
name from the list, and add your name to the bottom of the list.

When your turn comes, you will receive 15,625 women.  One of
them is bound to be better than the one you already have.  At
the writing of this letter, a friend of mine had already received
184 women, 4 of whom were worth keeping.  REMEMBER: this
chain brings luck.

One man's pit bull died and the next day he received a Playboy
swimsuit model.  An unmarried Jewish man living with his widowed
mother was able to choose between a Hooters waitress and a
Hollywood super model.

You can be lucky too, but, DO NOT BREAK THE CHAIN!
One man broke the chain and got his own wife back again.

Let's keep it going, men!  Just add your name to the list below!

Bill Clinton

William Jefferson Clinton

W. J. Clinton
