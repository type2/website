I have taken vehicals to One Day paint and Macco to have them spray for me,
I supply the paint and have the vehicals prepped and ready and they charge
me the cheapest paint job rate, the best thing about it is that their
painters are some of the best, all they do is paint all day.

ps: exmp. 356 Porsche sprayed for 99.99 and it came out beautiful.

Anyone near Milwaukee know where I could go to spray my bus.  I'm
desperate!  U-Spray doesn't rent out spray booths anymore.  I've go my
own HVLP and some good paint, but my garage is way too tight to do the
topcoat.  Need to make it one color before I move in a couple weeks.
Help!

Thanks in advance,

Chris
