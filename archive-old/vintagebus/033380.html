Michele &amp; Gene and List,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; does anybody have any over-the-wire diagnostics you can recommend for me 
to try and determine the real condition of my engine?  ...  I was thinking of 
making a few recordings of the engine in various states of running and put it 
on CD....anyone curious?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;

Try John Muir's Engine Sounds and more:
