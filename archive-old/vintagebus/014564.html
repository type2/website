Hi Roger &amp; Trudi
&lt;&lt; I have a doghouse fan that measures 34mm actual blade, not counting the
 plates that hold the blades together.  Does that make it a 35mm fan?&gt;&gt;
Well if your measurement is correct then it is a 34mm.  Up to now we have only
seen 33mm, 35mm, and 29mm and smaller for fan widths.
&lt;&lt;  I don't see any 2:1 pulleys for sale in my catalogs, I guess they were
 stock on the doghouse motors.&gt;&gt;
Right.  They were for the dog house cooling system and were the biggest dia.
pulleys you could get stock since the 36 HP engine.
&lt;&lt; There is a &quot;clunk&quot; in the steering when first starting to turn the wheel,
probably
 a tie rod end, but haven't located the source, yet.&gt;&gt;
Check your steering box for proper adjustment and lubrication.  Steering,
brakes and properly rolling suspension are more important than even an engine
for safety.
We never liked the paper air cleaners for the ACVW.  The oil bath air cleaners
are both better and easier to clean which you can not really do with the paper
air cleaners.  Sounds like you have a good project bus.   Happy VWing,  Eric &amp;
