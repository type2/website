Hi,
How right you are.  Plus unless you are one of those lucky and rich ones who 
only install NOS vintage German parts you have to ask yourself where and who 
made those parts for your vintage VW.  NASA?  NOT!
  The Saturn V rocket that took astronauts to the moon had over 2,000,000 
parts.  NASA figuring 99.9% of them would be good came to the figure of 2,000 
parts that would fail!  Thusly NASA engineered this rocket with lots and lots 
of back up systems and redundancies to C.Y.A. for the situation of no gas 
stations for 240,000 miles.  So if carrying extra/spare parts was good for 
the Right Stuff folks.  Then it is good for us!   Eric&amp;Barb
P.S. Today there are about 150 critical parts on the Space Shuttle that there 
are no redundancies or back ups for.  In otherwords if one of these parts 
fails on the way up or in orbit there will not be much to bury.  Needless to 
say there are lots and lots of folks there and elsewhere testing and 
inspecting these parts to make certain that they are made as perfect as 
possible.  Eric&amp;Barb
