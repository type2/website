I'm a television field photographer (videographer) for NBC.  I work
daily for the show Access Hollywood. We shoot celeb interviews, set
visits, awards shows and other terminally trivia stuff today's society
seems unbelievably enamored with. Today was a good day though,  we spent
the afternoon at a Beverly Hills pool  shooting a few models showing off
the latest from Bikini_dot_com.  Trust me they're not all like that.
