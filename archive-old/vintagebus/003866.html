Look what you did thom, All this talk of &quot;trap doors&quot; and you got people
thinking its big enough to possibly crawl through! =) its just a small
square hole, about the heigth of a tennis ball - heres a pic steve

Still got the bulkhead from that SC thom?


&gt;Your '57 wouldn't have had one; they were only done until 3/55

&gt;&gt; Hello everyone,
&gt;&gt;     I'm curious about this, my 57 singlecab has the bulkhead section
removed
&gt;&gt; in the middle so you can get at it from the cab from a previous owner. So
I
&gt;&gt; need to either find a matching piece, or see if the trap door could be an
&gt;&gt; option. What year was this done until ?  Anyone have more info?
