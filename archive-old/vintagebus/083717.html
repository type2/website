&gt; The indicator light is not connected to the flasher relay, &gt; (blue wire), but it is in a daisy chain between the oil
&gt; pressure idiot light, and the alternator idiot light
&gt; (black wire).  It continues to light up with the idiot
&gt; lights during all of the other tests below.

All three lights have one side connected to the hot-in-run
wire - circuit 15, black.  The other side of the oil
pressure light is grounded by the oil pressure switch on
the engine to turn on the light.  The other side of the
turn signal indicator light is grounded by the flasher
relay to turn on the light.  The other side of the
generator light is (basically) grounded by the voltage
regulator to turn on the light.

I am not next to a Bus or a Bentley right now, but IIRC,
the ignition circuit (black wires) gets connected to the
outer shell of the bulb sockets, and the wires to the
rest of the car get connected to the male push-on on the
bulb sockets.  These bulbs should be mounted in a plastic
block - isolated from the metal shell of the speedometer
case.

&gt; The alternator has three connections.  One is a screw
&gt; terminal labeled B+ (I have this one connected to the
&gt; heavy gauge black and red wire),

Sounds right...

&gt; one is a spade connector labeled D+ (I have this
&gt; connected to the idiot light, in other words I'm
&gt; pretending that terminal is a 61 terminal).

Could be right, could be wrong.  I would feel better
about it if it was labeled &quot;61&quot; or a couple of other
things besides &quot;D+&quot;.

&gt; The third connection is just a ground wire screwed  
&gt; into the outer housing of the alternator which I have
&gt; connected to the wiring harness ground.

Sounds OK.

&gt; I find it strange that my alternator has both B+ and D+
&gt; markings, and not 61 marking.  Does that mean it is  
&gt; not internally regulated?

Not sure, at this point.  If it had a &quot;DF&quot; terminal then
I'd be pretty sure that it was an external regulator type.

&gt; Then disconnected the alternator (did not reconnect
&gt; flasher relay), and engine will turn off with the
&gt; ignition switch.  That tells me that the problem likely
&gt; lies with the alternator, right?

Probably.  You might try this: leave the flasher relay
disconnected, and hook up the fat red wire back to the
B+ stud on the alternator.  Leave the blue generator
idiot light wire disconnected from D+.  Then try the
ignition switch.  If the engine turns off with the
ignition switch, this points another finger at the
alternator hookup.

&gt; I have a regulator that came with the bus, I'm not
&gt; clear on how it hooks up.  It has two big screw
&gt; terminals, and one smaller screw terminal stamped &quot;S&quot;.
&gt; The big terminals have no labeling.  I assume that the
&gt; regulator goes inline between the alternator and the
&gt; starter on the heavy gauge B+ wire, no?

Not enough information at this point to say how this
regulator should be connected or even if it goes with
the alternator in your Bus.  This is not something you
want to determine by experiment; the generator wires and
battery cables must retain all their smoke to work
properly.

Are there any visible part numbers or logos on the
alternator, and if so, what are they?  How about on
the regulator?
