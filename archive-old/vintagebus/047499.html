&gt; Off the main subject here but I was wondering if the 68-71 lids would
&gt; work on the 66-67's? How about the rear hatch?

&gt; engine lid no, rear hatch yes through some bay window year bus not sure
when.

Would it be at all possible to use the springs off the hatch on the '67
to spring load the hatch on the '63 ?

The 63 bus does not have the place for the spring to attach.   It has the
place for the bent elbow brace to attach.     take a look.  is differnt.
