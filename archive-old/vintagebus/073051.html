Subject: travel postcard from P&amp;C

We are here in Llano, NM, just outside of Taos.  We have enjoyed a couple days with friends but we are off and running again tomorrow towards Woodland Park, CO for the RMMW VW show.  We are going to cruise the Enchanted Ring around Taos tomorrow through Angel Fire then head up to the Great Sand Dunes Nation Park in CO to camp for the night.

Here are the newest travel postcards.  They are posted at
