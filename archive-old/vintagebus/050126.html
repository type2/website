Subject: Re: [VB] Bamboo Fuses

&gt;I'm looking at four weird fuses. They have four ridges or rings. Looks
&gt;like bamboo segments. Found 'em in a bay window as Karl and I were
&gt;relieving it of it's BN4 (at a salvage yard). Karl sez they're original,
&gt;but he was full of adrenalin or bus heater fumes. Same metal caps as the
&gt;grooved fuses, just ribbed.

I've seen those lots of times.  I don't think they're particularly valuable.
