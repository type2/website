Subject: RE: [VB] CB Radio antenna

Joel,

I am lookin' for one also.  You see, I was big into CB's like 10 years ago,
and I still have my set.  I did some pokeing around, and found this site:
http://www.eburg_dot_com/~trsradios/

I have never even inquired this site, so I don't know how they are, but it
is a start.

As far as brands, I remember the K40's are one of the brands to get, but I
cant think of an antenna mount.  Anyone?  I'll hopfully be on the road this
spring, so a CB will be handy, if not entertaining!  Back then, I spent
hours talkin'.  I'm cross posting to the wetwesties list, to see what
discussions happen...

Kevin Abrecht
The trip is on...

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Happy Friday everyone,
&gt; Some of you must be using CB radios in your busses. What kind of
&gt; antenna did you end up using, and where did you put it? I want the
&gt; radio for local traffic info, summoning help in an emergency, maybe
&gt; the occasional convoy. I don't need to be able to talk to folks in New
&gt; Zealand, but I do travel in some remote US locations, mountains,
&gt; deserts and the like, and I'd like to be able to call for help from
&gt; there. Any suggestions before I buy the wrong one?
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Joel
&gt;
