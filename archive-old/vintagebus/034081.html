in my opinion i would use the CB Performance mini sump with cleanable
aircraft filter.I have one of these on my 1776 single port and love it, it's
amazing the cr_at_p that it catchs. On my brand new VW factory 1600 in my
double door i have a pump filter, (genuine VW factory piece) as comes on the
new Mexican Type 1 beetles. My oil looks (does that mean anything) about the
same in each engine at each oil change, so i feel they both do the same job.
As far as the doghouse mount cooler, they work, are extremley messy when
changing oil, (manufacturer recomends useing cut up oil bottle to avoid
mess), This is a fairly new product introduced at the VW Classic last year,
so i can't believe there are any long term reports available on how it
works, also seems there would be drain back into case that would create an
air pocket New online catalog just a few weeks awayand on start-up could
cause long term engine damage. As i have stated I personally haven't used
this product, so I won't give it a thumbs up or down.

I'm getting ready to have an engine built for the 60.  Sorry NQ, but I'd
rather pay someone else to go thru the hassle...

Anyway, I was thinking of putting one of those (I think they're called)
&quot;factory filters&quot; on it, which is this do-dad which goes (replaces?) on the
doghouse oil cooler mount.  I've heard good things about them on RAMVA, but
I thought I'd ask here.

I think I'd also like to put on one of those extra oil sumps.  I had one on
the '56, and it didn't seem to do any harm, and I like the idea of a little
more oil to spread the wear across.   I already know they don't do jack for
additional cooling.
