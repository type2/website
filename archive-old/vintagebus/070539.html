Subject: RE: [VB] needle bearing crank?

SPG roller crank.  That's what that is.  You need to send it to me :-)

Nice cranks but don't over torque them.  They're great for high rpm road
race motors but suffered in the drag racing arena.  The later 82mm units
were pinned and welded for added strength.  They are pressed together! 

If its in good shape, use it.  If its bad, they are expensive to fix.
Most motorcycle places can do the work but hang on to your pocket book.


What stroke is it?  Most common units were 69 and 82.  Some 64s were
made for 40hp.


Nice find.

the rods this 
past weekend at a general car swap meet. The rods don't bolt on and the 
whole thing looks pretty beefy.

I found a picture on &quot;the samba&quot; of something that MIGHT be the same
(going 
from memory). Was wondering if anyone could help identify.

The picture I found is here:

I'll try and get over there sometime and get pictures of his to be sure.

Any help appreciated.
