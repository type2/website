Even though today is the 6th, it was last night when I wanted to post this
but ran out of gettupandgo so I hit the sack.

I picked up the beam, steering box, and bracket from the sandblaster's shop
yesterday.  They sure looked awesome.  I whipped out the brakleen and did a
really thorough job of checking for areas they missed and found just a few
spots that needed some attention.  Next I went over to my grandfather's shop
and he welded up the hole in the bottom of the shock tower for me.  Headed
home and got started painting with the POR15 around 9:00.  I had my sister
take a picture of me painting the front beam.  I told her that for this
photo, there would be no poses - just shoot a picture of me while I work.
So when these photos are developed, I'll be sure to post the URL.  I
finished up about 11:00 - everything is now a nice shiny black.  They look
new!  Next step is painting underneath the bus.  The plan is to do it on
Saturday - a big POR15 marathon.

More later...
