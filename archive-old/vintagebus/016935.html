&gt; well.._dot_compression test today shows 120 on 1,2, and 4...but #3 is 0.

&gt; only has 200 miles on it...


you may have a stuck exhaust valve and get away with a valve job. pop the
valve cover and check the valve action.

did you put oil in the #3 plug hole to and run another compression check?
 if it goes up you have bad rings.

also check my post on vacuum gauges in the archives. vacuum gauges a real
cheap and you can tell  a lot about the inside of your engine with out  a
teardown.

If you put on a new top end what would a Frankenstein motor like that be
used for?
Not everyone of us is a VW junkie and has the wherewithal or desire to
deal with such, a questionable engine. If it were mine i might run it
around locally in one of my vehicles.
My point is that you might suggest a new motor for you acquaintances'
westy. Then give them the old,&quot; well, we could try...etc.&quot; and go for a
piston cylinder/ head swap.

Dealing with hypothetical,

Ken
