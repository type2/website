Several parts houses sell the stamped metal panels that you should be able
to weld in place.  Look and see how its done to a single cab at
www.dropgates_dot_com .  They show a step by step bed repair there.

Subject: [VB] Seeking Doublecab bed


Hello all,

Yesterday, I was fortunate enough to attend the Butterfield Park Picnic in
Corona, what a good showing of busses and bugs there.  For those of you also
there, I had the beat-down DC in two-tone primer.
So, to the point, I talked with a fellow who told me that another guy who
typically sells wood slats at the OCTO shows had a DC bed and SC bed that he
wanted to get rid of.  I do not know any of these people's names, but
someone here might.  Or, someone may have a bed for my doublecab, which was
completely cut out by a P.O.

Any assistance or leads are greatly appreciated,
