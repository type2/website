&lt;&lt; I was actually talking about the trailing arm bushings in the beam, not the
 link pins, but the link pin sets I get out of Brazil for the 64 and above
 still have the needle bearings. &gt;&gt;
Hi Ronnie,
The first needle berings were used in 64 and even then there was only one per 
trailing arm.  Not until about 65 model year did VW start to use two of these 
per trailing arm!
