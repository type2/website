Well I took the test and got 100%.  Do I win anything?  I haven't paid rent this month yet due to buying bus parts, but I am looking to buy the house across the alley so I will have room to put more buses.

P.S.  Wade... did you really do the following:

Would you buy the worst rusted out bus you could find, and attach a light-up
neon VW emblem to the front, cover it with stickers and have enormous pride
in it?

I guess I am not the only one.


&lt;snip&gt;
I redid the test just a little...

Do you have a hard time deciding wether to pay rent or buy a project?
~ are you one month behind due to this fact?
~ did you mortgage your house to fund your VW project?
~ when you see the word &quot;transporter&quot;, does your brain interpret that as an
anagram saying &quot;rent or parts&quot; ?


Do you spend more money buying parts for the new project than the 5 others
sitting in your backyard?
~ do you spend money on rare parts/projects before you'll spend money on
NECESSARY mechanical parts for your running ones?

Do you refuse to wash your VW due to the fact it may fade the original paint
even more than it already is?
~ do you believe the dirt on your VW makes it look more &quot;vintage&quot;?

Have you recently spent more money on a set of taillights than you have on
your spouse for her birthday?
~does she know?

Do you refuse to let guests sleep in the spare bedroom because &quot;that's where
the VW parts go&quot;  ?

Have you ever spent twice as much on a original part just because it had VW
stamped on it where it couldn't be seen once installed?
~ even though it was IDENTICAL to a reproduction part?
~ will you only buy the $10 each original bolt/clip and refuse to buy the
&quot;exact same thing 5cents bolt/clip&quot; because &quot;its not correct&quot;  ?

Do you continue to put Vintage before safety?
~have you refused to switch over from cable brakes?

When buying interior products, do you buy the &quot;correct stuff&quot; or the &quot;fill
the space stuff&quot;?

Do you refuse to bang out your panels on your bus because you might &quot;hurt
your baby&quot;?

Would you recover your seats in Linoleum if that was correct for that year?

Would you buy the worst rusted out bus you could find, and attach a light-up
neon VW emblem to the front, cover it with stickers and have enormous pride
in it?

Is your wallet completely empty due to the above questions?

If you answered yes to all of the above Questions then you have reached the
point of VW insanity and you are on the correct mailing list.
You also have alot in common with me :)
