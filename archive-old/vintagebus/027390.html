Hi Mike,
it seems to have good sound deadening qualities on Stella (my 71)  as last
summer I coated the entire cargo floor and area over the transaxle and engine
with the stuff.  I also put carpet down...so...  People who ride in my bus say
its one of the quietest buses they've ridden in.  Normal voices at highway
speeds are no problem.  Come warmer weather (or when the weather will say
warm!!) I'm taking my interior panels off and installing styrofoam insulation as
it won't absorb water and it will work as an insulator and sound deadener.  I
used just under a gallon of the stuff on my bus and its pretty cheap.  Don't get
it on your hands...it can be a pain to get off :)

Of course you have to take out the entire interior to do this...but thats not a
big deal... I took out my westy interior by myself.

Hope this helps in some way...

Isaiah


&gt; Roofing tar has been suggested as an anti corrosion coating on the list. If
&gt; the stuff were applied behind the panels in a thick enough coat would it
&gt; have any sound/vibration dampling qualities?
