First the dream, and now this.
Everett, I think you have a problem.
Do the graphics in vinyl, and seam them together like a billboard.
As far as the tatoos........youll look like the puzzle guy in all the tatoo

&lt;&lt;A couple weeks ago, I was thinking about how it would be cool to have a 
short-sleeve button-down shirt with that pattern. 100% cotton, of course.  
Hint, hint.

I was also wondering how I would paint my Bus with the pattern.

Hmmm, what if I tatooed my entire body like that, interesting...
