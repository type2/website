Hey everyone - been a while since I posted you all on what is going on
around here.  I think the last thing I said is that I'd been riding my moped
to work and that up until yesterday when the slight thaw w had generated
enough moisture to ground out my coil.  I pedaled home the last 3 blocks at
lunch time and took my brother's Panda scooter back to work.  On the return
I put it sideways and went skidding down the road to the point where I had
to stop, rotate the scooter 90 degrees and take off again in the direction I
wanted to go.  I love being crazy and riding in the snow and ice!!!

Anyway, to put a little VW content into this message, I've been researching
ultralight aircraft that one can build.  One of them I've looked at is the
legal eagle ultralight at www_dot_usastores_dot_com/betterhalf.  It uses a Team
Minimax wood construction wing and for power a VW engine heavily modified
for ultralight use.  I ordered the plans and the video and it was really
neat watching and listening to this plane.

The engine is modified so that you are run on just the #2 and #4 cylinders.
The #3 and #1 spiggots are not utilized and on this particular design, the
case is not cut in half.  The carb is an updraft carb and the manifold runs
up through the oil sump area and into the front half of the engine case.
From there it splits and comes out each of the cylinder bores and into each
half-head.  The valve covers are sectioned as well as the head so you have
just a 2 cylinder VW engine.  The sound of this engine with it's chrome
plated brass sink drain exhausts is deafening! :-)  I personally have a big
problem with using an engine modified like this because I know the
weaknesses of a VW engine.  I would opt for the engine I already have - a
K440 with prop redrive unit.

Anyway, that's the latest.  The bug and bus sit under snow while I ride the
mopeds - refusing to expose my rides to the salt and sand that ruins every
car that drives on it.  For those of you who might have an inkling of
wanting to fly for fun, the legal eagle is a great little plane.  You can
also check out the www.affordaplane_dot_com site for an interesting craft but it
hasn't been flight tested yet.

Thanks for reading...

Erin
