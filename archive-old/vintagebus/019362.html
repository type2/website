Thom, I don't know if you remember the 21 window bus
which (I think) was on ebay about three months
ago...(which one, right?) the seller had all the
comments about how this bus should be a trailer queen,
and he didin't want his teenage son to have it blah
blah blah.


Well, I noticed that the guy had safaris, and that he
mounted a (non-VW) antennae to the A-pillar very low
and right next to the outer edge of the passenger side
windshield. It was a (PEP-boys?) antennae with an oval
footprint but the antannae came out at an extreme
angle. Sort of like the late 60's front quarter panel
bug  and front panel bus antennaes, but a slightly
different angle which it seemed, let you mount it
there and clear the safari and the door as well. I
think it stuck up just in front of the mirror arm?
Looked like it might be a fender or quarter panel
mounted replacement antennae for a Monte Carlo or
American piece of crap.

Worth a look.

It looked a lot less obvious than the two-mount over
the emblem option.

Just sayin'

&gt; I just aquired a Blaupunkt Frankurt radio for the
&gt; '60 DD panel, and now
&gt; I need an antenna for it.  I'd like to get one of
&gt; the &quot;up the center pillar&quot;
&gt; style that has the mount on the roof, like i had on
&gt; the '55, but I don't 
&gt; know where to get one.  The other option would be
&gt; the &quot;traditional&quot; double-post
&gt; mounted over the emblem.  I have safaris, so I can't
&gt; mount one on the side.
&gt; I don't like the spring-base antennas; I had one on
&gt; the '56, and it ended up 
&gt; chipping the paint on the rain gutter.
