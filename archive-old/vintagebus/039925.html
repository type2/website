So were the cargo area belly pans a standard item in most buses or what?  I 
don't have these on my 62 deluxe nor see any evidence that it once had them. 
  I don't know how close to an original resto I can get but if so, should I 
put these on my &quot;to do&quot; list ?  Other than strengthening the body do they 
serve any other purposes such as sound deadening ?
