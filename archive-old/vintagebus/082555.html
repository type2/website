Subject: Re: [VB] New VW longblock vs build up from scratch

&gt; I'd spend your monies with whom ever will give you good service.  Some
&gt; would rather build it themselves so they know what is in it instead of
&gt; chancing it to someone remote.  I bought a recondition trans once and then
&gt; took it down to have some beefier side plates and a super diff in it and
&gt; was told I would have done much better to have had the person doing the
&gt; local work just do the entire job.

&gt;&gt; Hi All - Just wanted to get list opinions on this.  I am budgeting for
&gt;&gt; a new motor for my 60 dc and I have a local reputable builder who will
&gt;&gt; work with me on this.   I will be having him basically build me a
&gt;&gt; turn-key, using all the extras from my donor motor.  I have zero time
&gt;&gt; right now, having just bought an old farmhouse, and I need this truck
&gt;&gt; working now.  I can order a new vw longblock and have it shipped to
&gt;&gt; him, or he can build me a new longblock using all new parts from the
&gt;&gt; case on up.  I'm interested in hearing list wisdom on the
&gt;&gt; advantages/disadvantages of either scenario.

I agree w/ David, even tho it will probably cost you more.  I went thru this
in my 63 DC. Blew up 1600 engine &amp; installed another w/ a newly &quot;pro&quot;
rebuilt longblock w/ my own rebuilt kadrons-ran like crap w/ left carb
flooding crankcase, changed oil, fixed carb, ran good, &amp; threw a rod w/ 700
miles on engine.  Damn! Long block rebuilder says my fault for carbs, not
his.  Now got 2 complete motors w/ rods thru top of case! What to do, what
to do?  Went to a very reliable hi performance local engine
rebuilder-started w/ new case, pistons, cylinders, german heads, oil pump,
reground crank, rods, cam, etc. He rebuilt the carbs, new generator, 009,
fan, rewelded tin, &amp; reused the rest of my good old stuff for a new turnkey
1776 motor.

&quot;Runs like a sewing machine&quot; but probably $800-1000 more than an all new off
the shelf motor from some guy in the back room of GEX, or Bergmann, etc. Any
issues, I have full local service, who knows exactly what's in the motor &amp;
how it was done, cost-priceless!

Tom Buese-motors, you can't drive w/o 'em.
