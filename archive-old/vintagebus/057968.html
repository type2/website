Subject: Re: [VB] retractable seatbelt installation webpage

I don't know about a 63, but my 67 DC came with factory mounting points
for three sets of rear belts.  On my 67, if you stick your head under
the rear seat and under the truck bed where the gas tank access doors
are, and look up, you can see a side-to-side rail with 3 evenly-spaced
sets of threaded holes that accept the standard seat belt bolt.  I was
able to find 2 sets of gray belts at a VW show that bolted right up.

&gt; I have a 63 DC that never had seatbelts, anyone willing to give me some placement locations/measurements?  Also, what about the rear seat over the storage compartment, how were seatbelts installed there?
