 I had been running my bus for about 8 months with no shocks. I had
 someone tell me that they had removed theirs and that it had handled
 better. Mine handled fine , but I think it handles a little better on
 the freeway, but not much different. The shocks I put on were KYB's and
 I have noticed that all of a sudden I am getting more wear on the
 outside of my rear tires. Let me know if you find anything to
 substantiate that.

the KYB Gas a Just is what you had?   they are too hard, I think so, in my 
opinion.   Get you some GR-2s from KYB,  these are softer and  magically make 
pot holes etc go away.  put shocks on your bus.  better for your suspension.  
  Have you greased your front end recently?  every tune up, or more often if 
you have no shocks.
