Well, the toolkit that the dealer gave me with my new Corbin Sparrow
seems like a good start, although certainly not exactly what I'd want
for a bus (nor nearly the desired quality).  It contains (ignoring the
SAE bits):

- ratchet
- sockets: 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13mm
- spark plug socket
- 3&quot; socket extension
- bit driver
- slotted, phillips, square, torx bits
- 6&quot; long nose pliers
- 3-way flashlight

(re: torx - my new 6 volt regulator came with a torx screw for the
main power take-off)

What I would add:

- wrenches (open at one end, box at the other): 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15,
  17mm; maybe two each of the 10, 13, and 15
- sockets: 14, 15, 17, 19, 21mm (plus whatever the fan pulley nut size
  is)
- locking pliers (vice grips or equivalent)
- normal pliers
- stubby driver to go with the full-length one (or long and short real
  screwdrivers; bit driver's probably sufficient for an emergency kit,
  though)
- one long square-shaft screwdriver for locking up the fan pulley when
  adjusting the belt; this should be a flat/standard screw driver so
  it can double for adjusting brake shoes
- wire cutter/stripper/crimper plus some female slip-on connectors
  and a small spool of wire (14 gauge?)
- lug wrench?
- volt/ohm meter; although a clip-on test light would be a fairly
  viable alternative
- gapping gauge that includes .006, .016, and .026&quot; blades (ideally,
  marked &quot;valve&quot;, &quot;points&quot;, and &quot;plug&quot;)
- a small, thin file; thin enough to be used for cleaning up a spark
  plug or a set of points
- a cheat sheet with the normally-used specs (per year, where
  required) and recommended spare parts cache; for the former, things
  like points gap, plug gap, torque settings for wheel lug nuts (tire
  shops will use them if you tell them what they should be); for the
  latter, we can argue a long time, but obvious things would be
  points, condensor, plugs, fan belt, a couple of quarts of oil, a
  rag, ...

For true emergency use, that should cover it.  Obviously, the list
gets much longer if you're talking about, say, being able to replace
the heads in a Wal-Mart parking lot.  I don't think that's the target
market here....
