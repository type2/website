Subject: cry for help....wahhhhhh

Hey all,
I got up the motivation today to fix the &quot;leaky wheel cylinder&quot; on the
drivers rear side...
looked at it...the wheel cylinder looked dry of brake fluid...I touched
some of the fluid...doesn't feel like brake fluid...smelled it...and it
didn't smell like brake fluid either.  It smelled of tranny
fluid...ahhh!!  no big deal I think...I ordered 2 new seal kits and have
them right here...so I'll just fix it up.  HAHA!! nope! never that
easy.  I took out the 4 bolts holding that cover on...and found metal
shavings (looks like glitter paint) and the blue seal in there was torn
up badly.  :(  I looked further...and the bearing that you can see with
just taking that first cover off...is bad.  It looks as if there is some
sort of cage in there that snapped apart and is all bent to hell.  I
looked in RMMW for one of these bearings...no go.  and for the 64+
trannies...its the most expensive one.  just my luck.  $50 for a
bearing...and thats the later style bearing.
Is this part even a bearing?  I see big round balls in it...but i
haven't taken the backing plate or anything like that off yet.
Does anyone have a spare bearing they'd be willing to send...asap?!  or
tell me where i can get one.  I need this bus rolling saturday for the
event(s).

thanks!

Isaiah
