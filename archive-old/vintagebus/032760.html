it all most friday so ill tell ya guys what i just got. 
A friend called me and told me to come outside my house. he was in front with 
a moving van. he opened the bach and asked me to help him carry it out. It 
was one of those giant vw signs you see from the freeway. its about 9feet in 
diameter an is sitting on my roof right now. he asked his boss at ford if he 
could have it and brought it home for me knowing that i love vws.
hope all of you find something this cool this weekend.
