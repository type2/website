Subject: Re: [VB] Anybody have a good heater?

double and triple check all connections for looseness.

Also, do you have a doghouse ?   the doghouse blows more air.

&lt;&lt; The heat just seems to trickle out of the vents at best, front and rear.
 The tube under the bus is there, and the insulation is trying to be there.
 I'm going to insulate that better eventually.  All connections are good, and
 the flaps are there, but the thermostat is not installed.  I've been
 thinking of trying out an extra blower motor to improve the heat, has
 anybody had any experience with these?
 
 &gt; I have really good heat in my 65 westy.   &gt;&gt;
