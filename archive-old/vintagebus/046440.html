working on the front end, I found play in the king pins and such. Hmm..let me 
see how the grease looks. The things wer totally empty! A couple shots of 
grease everywhere and everythign tihtened right up. God I love this bus.
=  == = = 
be aware that the grease may take up the slack, but it does not fix the play, 
 you may notice the play 'returns'
........
 I still have about 2-3&quot; of play in my steering, but I tracked that down to 2 
tie rod ends that run from pitman arm to the other pitman arm?? I'm not sure 
what they call them, but I know what they are.
-== = = = 
perhaps you mean the drag link that goes from the pitman arm on the steering 
box to the swing lever

.......
 My axle beam was also near 
empty on grease. I got to working on my 65 to pull the front brake baking 
plates which was missing on my 67, and it isn't as easy. I fought with it for 
about two hours yesterday, and did get one side off. Still fighting with the 
other side. THe drum is finally unfroze, but still not wanting to come off. 
There has to be an easier way....
= = = = =
to get stuck drums of I take the wheel off, use a hammer and a big 
screwdriver for pounding on, slip the screwdriver through the brake adjust or 
lug hole, place the end on the brake shoes and whack it, move back from one 
brake shoe to the other, and release your annoyance on it.  The drum will 
come off.  Of course, use approriate bus support..   PLace the wheels under 
the bus as well, justin case.

BTW, how are your inner and outer front wheel bearings?
............
On that note, my 65 has dual wheel cylinders on both sides. Is this correct 
for my 67 as well? 
= = = = = 
yes.   
..........
I hadn't factored that into my estimate, but I did count 
on replacing everything on the rear brakes, whcih I don't have to do now, so 
I guess that makes up for it. 
I plan on taking all drums and torsion arms and backing plates and other 
assorted pieces to get sandblasted today(hopefully), and hopefully by the 
time I get out of the field next week all my parts will be in.
=  = ==
sandblast torsion arms?   why?   Do not sandblast the part that goes in the 
torsion tube in any case.
..............
 I stil need to 
test my master cylinder out and I am hoping it doesn't need replaced($$$) but 
it is looking pretty good. 
Any suggestions as far as what shocks are best recommended for this? I 
usually use KYB on all my type 1's but I'd liek to hear what the type 2 pros 
think. 
=====
I like the KYB GR-2s.   The gasadjusts are too bouncy I think.  THe GR-2s 
made the potholes magically disappear.
...............
Another question before I forget, my brake pedal rubs on a bolt in the frame 
when I depress it. Is it just bent? I have to replace my spring on the pedal 
as it is wore out and I was thinking I would put an extra washer or two in 
there to kinda space the pedal away a little, but is this a common problem? 
= = = =  =
not sure what to say, can't quite picture it.  of course, it should not rub 
on anything.
 

cheers on your progress
