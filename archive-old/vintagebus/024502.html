Subject: Hard-to-light fridge

Hey Campers,
My '86 Westy has the hardest fridge to light, does yours?  In Sean's
tech notes on Vanagon Dometic fridge removal he mentions that you have
to be paaaaatient when relighting due to air in lines.  He suggests
turning on stove burners to speed things up.  Is there an adjustment for
the striker/flame jet in the event the igniter is too far away?  If so,
does it mean I have to take the whole fridge out to do it?  Anybody
know?

thanx.
