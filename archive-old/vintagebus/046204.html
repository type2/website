Subject: WTD &quot;Flat&quot; wheelwell panels to fix Hippie camper
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Need some &quot;flat&quot; rear wheelwells to fix the 62 Westy we are working on....

I am sure those Chevy wheels and adapters were cool back then ,
 but it sure makes a lot of work putting it back original........

Anyone having  a donor pair please email me direct.......

thanks for your help.......

PS.....at least we can thank the hippies for keeping so many buses alive all 
those years........
