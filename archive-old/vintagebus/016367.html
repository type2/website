Hey all,

Got my 66 deluxe goin last night and he got me to work today just fine.  Had 
my points replaced a couple a weeks ago and the old ones were pitted bad.  
Well slapped new coil on last night and repared the shady wiring that was 
most likely grounding out that may have melted my last coil.  New coil no 
start.  Pulled the points and they were worse than the previous described.  
So I sanded down the 1st points and she fired right up not even seeming out 
of time.  Could those shady wires on going to the carb and coil have caused  
my points to pit?  I've heard leaving the accessory on is hard on points.  
Any tips.

Thanks,

eric
66deluxe
