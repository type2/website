&gt;
&gt; &gt; does anyone have the contact info for the Z bed makers, or a set of
plans?
&gt; &gt; I have the mounting hardware, but no bed, and no guide as to where to
&gt; drill
&gt; &gt; the mounting holes.
&gt;
&gt; In my case I didn't drill any holes,  I may at some point to stablize the
&gt; z-bed a bit more, but at this point it is secured at the bottom in the
exact
&gt; same way is the rear seat was - I forget off had whether or not I had to
&gt; drill any hole in the wooden base of the z-bed but I did have to cut out
a
&gt; place for the heating log,  I also made a notch about 1 1/2 inches by 30?
&gt; maybe, so the heat from the heat log doesn't stay trapped inside the
z-bed.
&gt; I would suggest you find someone near by and just measure their pieces of
&gt; plywood.

&gt; Rex was my inspiration for convincing my wife to recover my z-bed - I
showed
&gt; her what a nice job his wife did and how it was her first sewing project -
&gt; kinda shamed her into it ;).  Now I'm in the process of convincing her to
&gt; make a cover for this very nice, very thick down comforter I have - I got
&gt; some really nice Mango colour material that'll look great.
