Subject: RE: [VB] Angle of Dangle

A friend of mine, the one with the busted left knee, would like to argue the
point with you about the floor jack. I have seen many methods with floor
jacks and chains and whatever. A lot of people get away with it without any
bodily damage, just lucky and EXTRA careful I guess. For the rest of us, the
Bentley procedure is probably the safest. This subject had an awfully long
thread when I asked how to do mine a year ago.

You don't really need a compression tool for bus plates, they dont have a
preload like a beetle. floor jack works well. I used a magnetic protractor
from sears. $5-$8 range
