Have you got plans for New Year's?   NO?  Hows about....BUS CAMPING!!! Can
you imagine a better way to bring in the new year!!

NEW BUS RESOLUTION II: brought to you by the FULL MOON BUS CLUB
DATES:  DEC 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 2002  and JAN 1, 2003
come-n-camp as many nights as you can, even if it's only new years eve

WHERE:  PINE RIDGE CAMPGROUND - Spartanburg, SC
located near Walnut Grove Plantation

LINK TO MAIN SITE:
http://www.fullmoonbusclub_dot_net/nbrc/nbrmain.htm

They do have cabin and cottage rentals in this campground,  so if your too
warm blooded for cold camping in a bus, then come and rent a cabin. You'll
be able to sleep in cozy comfort but still mingle with all the buses.  Call
the campground for info on cabin rentals. The campground phone # is:
(864)576-0302.


You will NOT need to call and make reservations if your camping in your bus,
but you can if you like:      They are not very busy at this time of year,
so we will almost have the entire place to ourselves.



DIRECTIONS TO CAMPGROUND:   Take I-26 away from Spartanburg (towards
Columbia, SC) and take Exit 28: HWY 221.   Take HWY 221 NORTH, approx. 200
feet to light, and turn right on &quot;Stillhouse Road&quot;.  Go one mile to Stop
Sign and take left on &quot;Ott Shoals Road&quot;...go 1.5 miles and see campground
signs on the left.
