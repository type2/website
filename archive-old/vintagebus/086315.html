 Thanks Susan!
 
Greg &amp; I recently bought most of his remaining 15&quot; early bus rims... He seems a nice guy, and definately was thinking of retiring.   In fact I saw him throw a bunch of stuff in the dumpster... type 3 glass I think.

in case you guys didn't see this in your digests or didn't get it at all.
It might be worth an excursion or phone call in case you are interested in 
anything.

&gt; Sad news for the VW Community in the North West.
&gt; 
&gt; After 34 years of serving the VW community from their Lynnwood WA. location,
&gt; Schaffner Motors is closing as of 15 June 2006. Schaffer's has been well
&gt; known for their honest and competent service, the full restorations on VW's,
&gt; and as a source of used parts for the vintage VW community.
&gt; 
&gt; Rudi Schaffner asked me to send this notice to all the various VW lists I'm
&gt; on.  He emphasized that he wants to express his deep thanks to all his loyal
&gt; customers from over the years and make it clear he will still be selling
&gt; vintage parts from has large stock but over the Internet, not from the
&gt; Lynnwood location.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The good news is that he really, really needs to get rid of the 'Big Stuff'.
&gt; This is body panels, doors, hatches, suspension parts, all the stuff that is
&gt; too big (and to many) to move to the smaller location that will be used to
&gt; continue to sell over the Internet.  Although mostly Bug and Bus parts,
&gt; there is also a supply of Vanagon body panels, interior door panels, etc.  
Also
&gt; wheels including two full sets of factory alloys.  Some Vanagon seats,
&gt; including a gray Vanagon center seat.  A set of cabinets from an '80 Westy.
&gt; I didn't try to write down everything that Rudi has there.  BUT the prices
&gt; will be very right, he doesn't want to ship this stuff off to the crusher.  He
&gt; handed me a big stack of aluminum curtain rails (mostly from Bus based
&gt; campers) and said &quot;Pass them along to anyone that can use them&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Also available is a whole shop full of tolls and equipment.  I don't have a
&gt; list of what machinery and tools are available, but if you do your own work
&gt; and are looking for VW specific tools or shop machinery now is an
&gt; opportunity to maybe acquire some equipment that you know is in running
&gt; order and ready to go.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; So, if you are in the process of a restoration, or need to replace a door or
&gt; hatch or body panel or are looking for anything that you might need in the
&gt; future (and don't want to pay shipping from somewhere else in the country)
&gt; then I suggest you contact Rudi and find out if he has what you need.  The
&gt; prices on the 'Big' stuff will be very good.  The shop is open during the
&gt; week, closed on the weekends.  It is probably worth the trip if you are
&gt; within a reasonable distance to drive to the shop and bone yard and have
&gt; Rudi show you what he has. I counted about 40 Bugs sitting there right now
&gt; and then there are all the parts stored and ready to go.
&gt; 
&gt; He can be reached at 425-778-6900 or email at schaffner.motors_at_verizon_dot_net .
&gt; The address is 21705 Hwy 99, Lynnwood, WA. 98036.  Take the 220th exit from
&gt; I-5, head West to Hwy 99, turn North, immediately on your right.
&gt; 
&gt; BTW, don't contact me with questions, especially about Bus parts:  I'm
&gt; totally ignorant when it comes to Buses.  And I'm not in a position to pick
&gt; up and store much of anything for people, I live in a condominium and my
&gt; storage area is full.  I can go look at an item if it is important, that's
&gt; all.
