the bearings should be tight, and darn near close to a 
press fit (C3 tolerance?), hence the need for a puller. if they are too loose on 
the axle, the centers will spin and weld themselves to the axle. cleaning them 
up with emery cloth may help, but i wouldn't get too crazy. that's also why 
there is a specified tool when installing them also, that presses on both inner 
and outer races of the bearing, because it is a tight (press) fit.

good luck getting them off. it can be done without a 
puller, but it's a milloin times easier with the correct tool.

Tap the bearing back in, take a peice of emery cloth and clean-up the axle 
shaft and take a long

punch and lightly tap the bearing until it comes off. These bearings are 
not a press fit and it

shouldn't take much force to get them off.
