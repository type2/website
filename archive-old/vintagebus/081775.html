I too have a freeway flyer, which is  fantastic at 65 on the highway,
however at speed closer to 50-55 the fan just  isn't spinning fast
enough for my taste as evidenced by the slightly higher  head temps.
Nothing horrible, just working on getting my bus exactly where I  want
it for my driving style.
