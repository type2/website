On to the bus material...I read the Idiot's manual and I clearly

understand the &quot;How To Drive A VW&quot; section, but having driven a

watercooled Cabriolet for the last ten years, I am not accustomed to

the sounds I hear coming from this little VW engine during higher

revs.  It seems that if I follow the shifting guidelines I get

this -flat- kind of sound and I think I'm about to blow something up.

Also, I should REALLY never shift up to 4th while going 35-40 mph?

Excuse the very beginner question, but after a month of driving, I

want to make sure I'm not tearing up my engine.  It was rebuilt 500

miles ago if that makes a difference.

your bus' actual shift points depends on it's gearing.    In most VWs I am in
4th by 35 mph.   My 61 gets 3000 rpms at 38mph, which is actually quite high
geared, and sometimes it is 40mph when I go to 4th.   Do NOT asume that your
bus has that gearing.   My 59 truck seems to want to shift into 4th just over
30mph, it is geared much lower.     If I took it to 40 in 3rd it'd complain
like anything.    Unfortunately, the gearing is hidden in the tranny and you
can't see it.  I recommend buying or borrowing a tach to find out what rpms
you are doing at what speeds in different gears.  This ties into the whole rpm
dealy that has had a certain amount of talk about  it.   My PBO is that the
max sustained rpms is 3,000 for longetivity of the motor.   Driving at higher
rpms causing increased wear and can well contribute to overheating.  On the
other end, under 1500 rpms tends to lug it, so you want it not too low, not
too high, but just right.

With 500 miles on a rebuild I ask if your valves have been adjusted and the
oil changed.   The valve train settles in and so initially the valves need to
be adjusted more often than the usually recommended 3,000 mi interval.     Try
that.
