Subject: Re: [VB] Big long studs that hold on heads - and Drilling holes
  in heads. 

I'd remove the stud and check out the threads.  If they look okay, just screw 
it in so they are the same depth in as the ones you like. About till the 
threads are not visible where it goes into the case, but maybe not quite that 
far.   I've had some do this and just stopped where I wanted and it's fine.  
If it's screwed in too far it's a pain getting the head nut on.

um...   but how easy is it to screw in?  I mean if you can just take the stud 
with your hand and screw it in/out there is something wrong.   If it is like 
that or the threads are funky invest in case savers.

&lt;&lt; on.  I went to replace the one shorter stud I had removed and it just kept
 going into my motor.  It went in (probably 1/4 inch or so) deeper than the
 other three.  Is there something I am supposed to put on these threads?  Or
 should I just screw it in as deep as the other 3. The other three are 
actually
 quite tight - it seems odd that this one won't tighten. That brings me to the
 4 for the other side.  How deep do they go in.
