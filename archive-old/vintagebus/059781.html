Subject: Re: [VB] Forged or not

Oh really? That would be outstanding if I didn't have to rebuild it. I didn't check the front
bearing (how do you do that with the case together and the oil slinger in the way?). I was told to
take the flywheel off, take the seal out and move the crankshaft back and forth in the case and feel
the rear bearing for movement. When I did this the rear bearing did move but only .001 to .002 in.
In fact it is hard to tell that the bearing is moving at all but after doing it a number of times, I
can feel a very slight movement.

The shims are .010, .008 and .011 in. One of them has a groove worn in it where the flywheel was
turning against it. The mechanic I was talking to said this wear on the shim is a symptom of too
much end play.

Do you think I should just re-shim it and keep on truckin'?

I wouldn't be to quick to condemn a motor with that amount of end play.  spec
is .003 to .005&quot;.  yours if not far out and could probably be safely
reshimmed.  I'd take into account other factors- how is the compression, does
the front main bearing move?  what amount of shimmage does it already have?
