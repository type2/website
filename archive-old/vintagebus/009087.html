Tonight I jacked up the bus and got underneath it to start surmising the
wiring situation.  Someone in the past had done a massive black tape special
on the main wiring harness as it exited the floor of the bus and ran towards
the back.  I unwrapped the whole thing and found out every single wire was
soldered or crimped and in places, 2 inch stretches of bare copper wire were
used to bridge the gap between the rear harness and front harness (which
someone obviously hacked themselves on to.)

I unwrapped all the eletrical tape and after double checking that all colors
on the wires matched, started cutting the wire.  I then got crimp connectors
on all the wires and am going to wait for the trip to the shop tomorrow to
finish it up  The main problem with this harness was the wires were all
soldered (that in itself isn't that bad) and then covered with the tape.  It
took forever to undo it all but I'll fix the rest tommorrow.  I'm pretty
tired so I'll post more later...
