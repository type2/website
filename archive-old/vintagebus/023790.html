Subject: Re: Speedo/fuel gauge

I Have A speedo/ fuel gauge in my Binz that PO installed. It is out of
a 71 bug, and the combo works great. The fuel tank is out of a 65 bus
and the calibration between gauge/tank is right on. This is the way to
go if you have an early bus and don't want to bore a 2&quot; hole in your
dash for the gas gauge. The PO saved the original speedo so it can be
reinstalled if need be. All indicator/warning lights work OK also.
