Subject: [VB] Westy sub-flooring

While on the way to a Savannah show with Dave Easterwood, I brought up the fact that the sub-flooring (belly pans) on my Westy needed some work, and how should I go about it?  Dave sez he has not seen a Westy with a complete sub-floor in it, only one '67 that had the outer sides but an uncovered center section.  My '67 SO-42 has a pop-top, and with it being the only pop-top Westfalia I'd examined in great detail, I assumed *all* of them had sub-floors.  It is my understanding now that they do not.  Raistrick's '66 SO-44 lacks a sub-floor, for example.  So I'm wondering how my bus wound up with one, a complete one no less?  Factory goof?  M-code?  Any other folks with turret-tops and sub-floors?  I checked the archives, seems like only sunroof buses and double-doors had 'em.  I'm planning to unveil the M-code plate tommorrow...it is currently covered with shag carpetting.
