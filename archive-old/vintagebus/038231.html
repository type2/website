Hi everyone.
I just finished updating our Peace, Love, Freedom, Volkswagen website.
You know us, we make vinyl and canvas products for busses and campers.
Any way the site should be fully compatable with PC's and Mac's.
But, for those of you who can't support frames, sorry, but I haven't made a
no frames site yet.
The navigation is real easy, and it loads up fairly quickly for those slower
modems. Yeah you know who you are. :-)

Brouse through and enjoy. I've added many photos and info links to our
products pages.
If you have any difficulties let me know. I am pretty sure all of the &quot;bugs&quot;
are gone. &lt;*snicker* bugs, He he&gt;

Remember, Winter is the best time to order cause we are not busy with shows
and tons of other orders.
