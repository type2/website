Hi Steve,
Your header will be leaning out the engine and is not a good thing for your 
bus if you keep the engine well below 4,000 RPM.  A stock bus muffler will 
have the correct back pressure and keep the engine richer running and cooler.

What width cooling fan are you using?  33 or better yet a 35mm (Inside 
measurement!) is better.  Anything thinner will be nothing but trouble.

Which diameter lower pulley?  A 2:1 ratio at the least must be used!

Even changing your fan belt length and shimming the upper pulley wider can 
increase your pulley ratio to well above 2:1 ratio.

Keeping your RPMs at  3,000RPM or even a bit lower in higher outside temps in 
all gears for cruisng will help cooling greatly!  You might be better off 
with a 3.875 R&amp;P freeway flier with .82 fourth gear like we have since you 
are already running a 1641cc engine like us.  Though you might want to go to 
SP head like us for better low RPM power.

If you do install a small nut tranny (Hopefully with a 4.125 R&amp;P inside which 
can be checked for when you have the axle off!) put on the later 64-67 RGB 
swing axles to help keep the RPMs down!

 We have had good luck with 7.1:1 CR and your lower 6.8 or 6.9:1 compression 
would be just cooler running.

Which distributor are you running and at what timing?

You do not mention what size air correction jets you are using and these 
could be too big leaning out your fuel mixture at higher RPMs.  Unless you 
are running a 1776 or bigger engine and/or drag racing RPMs (4,000RPM) the 
stock carb will do just fine.

Best to run stock oil pressure relief spring/s for your type/year engine and 
a solid non-gooved pressure piston if you ever drive in temps below 60F.

Did you install foam seals on not only the doghouse tin sealing surfaces, but 
on the front/rear/top sides of the cooler to make sure the air flow is going 
through the cooler fins and not around?

&lt;&lt; tried both with tubes from shroud to heaterboxes, and with tubes blocked 
off for more air to the heads. No difference. &gt;&gt;

Are those German heater boxes or those darned cheapie Dansk boxes without any 
fins on the inside of the J-tubes?  With the muffler off take a peer into the 
heat exchangers through there.  With stocker heat exchanger we have seen big 
oil temp differances!

Ddi you clean out all the casting flash in the heads?  Sometimes there is 
some of this in the cylinders.

Make sure with the engine off to reach around and feel for anything sucked 
into/ blocking the cooling fan!
