Subject: One Man Brake Bleeder

In an effort to continue to be able to do work on the VW's 
independently, I'm looking for recommendations for a one man brake 
bleeder.

  I have bought the little $8.00 
&quot;one-way-valve-container-with-a-magnet-on-the-side&quot; and it kinda 
works. Turns out to be more of a pain to use and isn't always perfect.

What are some of the better tools available higher up on the food 
chain? Which works best? I've got a compressor setup if that helps.

On a side note my '59 crewcab truck wouldn't fire up last weekend 
when I put it all back together after swapping used tranny's. I 
thought my fuel line was clogged. Checked and changed it. Nope. With 
a fresh head today I figured out it was just the hot wire had come 
loose from the coil. Simple disconnected wiring has been a 
re-occurring problem for me after re-installing engines. I always 
seem to miss them even after looking for that very problem and can't 
figure out why they won't start. Come back the next day and there it 
is clear as day. One day I'll learn to get it right the first time.

I don't have brakes, but my truck does shift from 1st to 2nd and has 
a reverse. And it &quot;goes&quot;. So that at least makes me feel good. Now if 
it'll just make it to 3rd and 4th I'll be in business! Gotta have 
brakes to test that though. Learned a lot about transaxles on this 
little project. Good prep for my REAL VW's.
