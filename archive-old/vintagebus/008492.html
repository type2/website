&gt; can I test a 6V deluxe clock in my 12V bus? Oherwise,
&gt; how can I do it other than getting a 6V auto battery?

Just run it with 12v!  I have a 6v clock in my 66 deluxe that runs just fine
on 12v.

&gt; Are the hands white? What about the 1/4&quot; beveled lip
&gt; just inside the lens? Mine is dark grey-brown. Does
&gt; anyone have a pic of a restored or NOS clock?

Can't really tell....mine is dark and dirty....but it keeps good time.

&gt; The back of my clock has a flat tab on the bulb and
&gt; another on the white part of the case back. Is this
&gt; the  positive, and the ground just occurs by mounting
&gt; it?

Yes to all.
