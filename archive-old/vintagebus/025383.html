Jimi and everybody,

I am pretty sure that a couple weeks ago I picked up the second issue.  It had an
insert for JCWhitney parts cataloge in it.  In any case, I agree with you, VWCC
is the best mag out there right now, but can be a real bear to find.  I have
found that it has many more tech repair articles than the HVWs and Trends.  It
also isn't all saturated  with water bettles and what not like the other two are
becoming.  For those of you that haven't read picked one up yet, track one down.
In my opinion it fills a niche the others miss.  If there are any VWCC reps or
employees on the list, keep up the good work.

&gt; if any of you live near a middle of nowhere wal-mart that carries every mag
&gt; imaginable and then some see if you can find it.
&gt; i traveled up to my grandparents (St. Clairsville, OH) on spring break and
&gt; the first was at wal-mart. this wal-mart is in this super shopping area where
&gt; people from all over the valley go.  then i went back up on mothers day and
&gt; forgot to check for it.
&gt; does any one know if a second one came out or not?
&gt; this is the second time the mag has been published.  last time it was
&gt; monthly, now its quarterly.  i honestly think it is better than VWTrends and
&gt; hotVW's. the main problem, to me, is the lack of promotion of the mag.
&gt; let me know what you think and if you have seen the second issue.
