&lt;&lt;Just gotta hit them backroads and drive slooooow.&gt;&gt;

Hey you guys are wasting your energy. Or maybe your restoration time. Try this, Stop or call the local cop shop. Befriend someone if you can and ask about the old cars. If you get past their apprehension you will have a wealth of information as they know where all the old cars are. Another good resource are the delivery guys, fuel oil, UPS, USPS, FEDX. Some of my best finds have come from my propane delivery friend. Low cost too, a case of brew per find on average.

Now your armed, go on out there and get those buses that need rescuing.
