Subject: Reproduction lens source???

I happened on this reference while searching for Ren**lt restoration
resources.  I've edited the text to eliminate superfluous verbiage.  Has any
one tried this service for VW type 2 (or any) lens reproductions?

&quot;Specializing in making reproduction plastics lenses in small quantities (1
or 2) at very reasonable prices.&quot;  Highly recommended; the lenses he made
for me were so identical to an original, I would never have known the
difference!  ...I got mine done in amber, but you can also request clear if
you prefer. ...These are amazingly low priced.  ...He can make a
reproduction from any lens...
