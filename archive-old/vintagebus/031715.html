I have contemplated this for a long time. I have already cut the torsion out
of my very first bus I owned (64 standard) and have fit a late  (bay window)
torsion housing to it (but not welded in) for fitting purposes. The problem
I have encountered so far is the width of the new rear suspension, I will be
able to counter this problem with some deep offset wheels (front wheel drive
style). The object of this is to use the bus automatic (has one of the
strongest gearboxes in the world, same as used in Audi's and numerous off
road race cars.
  My plan was to also install a type 4 engine converted to upright with AC,
power steering and power brakes. The steering is going to be accomplished by
using a late Vanagon power rack, modified to work on a bay beam with bay
disc brakes. I have a customer in Texas who has already done this and will
use his specs on this conversion. I did contemplate using the whole Vanagon
front suspension or a F#_at_D Mustang 2 front suspension, but after hearing
that the beam/Vanagon rack worked I'll go for the easy way.
  Why you all ask before I get flamed to death. Well I want a smooth riding,
a/c, PB and PS vehicle to tow with the comforts of a newer vehicle but still
have the Vintage Bus look. I have plenty of vintage buses to drive, but just
want to do this to show that we can have the best of both worlds. Heck if
Kyle can have a V8, I surely can have an auto 4 banger.
