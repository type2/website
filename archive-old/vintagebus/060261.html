Subject: RE: [VB] redux box adapter kit...

W00000! Crazy driving! I've never tried pushing 50 in 3rd. Your spring
plate stops are going to stop the tire on downward travel regardless.
For off raoding in j33ps, the fornt sway is removed to allow more
individual suspension articulation, which is what you'd want for a truck
with one hole in a ditch and the others way above it. I just don't think
buses have enough 'dip' in the rear suspension for that, although they
are pretty high in the clearance dept. My bus has more underchassis
clearance on level ground then my TJ j33p (soon to be for sale to rid
myself completely of watercooled cars). The torsion bar concept doesn't
support tires in all wacky positions as much as spring suspended live
axle or indenpendant a arm sprung suspensions.
The sway away stuff would proably make this effect worse, as it another
bar with torsion on it across the rear.
Don't know about the tub design, although I don't see how it would
increase downward travel at all, which would alos ential the torsion bar
loosing its preload or going to negative preload, which should waste em
in short order I imagine.
AL 66 dlx (still screwing around with that FI fasty.....)


&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I really believe its more of a suspension setup than an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;areodynamic one:)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;when the front dives into a corner, the rear tire opposite
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the corner will
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;come plum off the ground. Like when your out in the woods
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;cuttin firewood, ya
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;really gotta look out for stump sink holes, right front
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;tire falls in to the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;hole, left rear will be hangin in the air!
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; By the way... in the SC, a high speed corner consist of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;45-50 mph in 3rd.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;we cant all have a Porsche:)
