Subject: WTB- sun roof piece-parts were stolen
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hi, I am hoping someone can help out.  A friend of mine got some of his bus 
stuff ripped off, including the front bow for the 65 sunroof deluxe.  Does 
anyone have one they would part with for money or parts trade? (he said he 
has a pristine front stamped bumper for example).  TIA.  Sucks to have your 
bits taken.  Personally I lock up and have big dog around.

Clara
