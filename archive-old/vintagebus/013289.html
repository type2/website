Subject: 36hp stale air flaps?
Message-Id: &lt;199906211757.KAA0000018129_at_albatross.LPL.Arizona.EDU&gt;

Hi all,

Recently, I had the 36hp engine out of my '59 panel
to do various maintenance jobs including fixing an
oil leak (oil cooler seals) and replacing a broken
clutch return spring.

After cleaning the long block and engine tin I found
that the tabs on the bottom of the rear stale air flaps,
that is, the ones that *close* when you turn on the
heat, are all broken off and the flaps no longer work
properly with these tabs missing.  What have other
people done to remedy this situation?  I suppose I
could weld on some little pieces of metal to hold
the flaps in place when they pivot up but I was wondering
if there are any aftermarket parts for this.  The
lower tin and the heater boxes are in good shape except
for this problem.

Note on cleaning tin:  I got a big galvanized steel tub
at the feed store and filled it with water and
TSP (tri-sodium phosphate substitute), propped the tub
up on bricks, and stuck my two burner propane camp stove
under there.  After boiling for an hour or so, even
the most horrible greasy dirty, crudded up engine tin
comes clean, and most of the paint also comes off.  This
was the first time I tried this method and I'm sold on
it!  Much Much Much nicer than scrubbing stuff clean
with solvent and/or oven cleaner and/or Simple Green.
