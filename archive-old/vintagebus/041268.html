&gt; &gt;yep thats how i have to do it i am 6-5 and have a size 15 shoe its all

&gt; &gt;one leg at a time

&gt; 
&gt; One thing I found out when I was driving the bus Saturday is that I kept
&gt; griding gears.  I found out why...I was clutching with the middle of my foot
&gt; and ramming the toe part of my foot into the kick panel area.  After I
&gt; learned to clutch with my toes, it worked a heckuva lot better but it'll
&gt; take some getting used to.

I have the same problem (6'2&quot;, size 12) and I don't even have any kick
panels.... I really have to concentrate on using my toes on the clutch
pedal.
