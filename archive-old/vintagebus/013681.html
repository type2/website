Message-ID: &lt;19991016142128.29790.rocketmail_at_ web605.yahoomail_dot_com&gt;

Just got the wiring diagram for the SC (Thanks Thom:)
and had a question. On the Truck, the turn signals
have duel element bulbs &amp; sockets.... I forgot the
#ing stamped in em but do know theyre Hella. But it
also has the small parking lights in the headlight
buckets... is there somethig im missing? Several Volks
have siad that theyre supposed to be single element as
does the diagram.... What to do, what to do....
 Did I mention theres no blinker relay, just trying to
get em to work the way there supposed to... 
 Thanks in advance for any help/advice,
