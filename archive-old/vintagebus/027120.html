&gt; On to the questions.  What can I expect to have to do to get this thing rolling, just far enough to get it on a trailer?

About 10 years ago we had a '50 Willy's Jeepster with two rear drums locked up.  We used a floor jack to roll it onto the trailer, but we were on concrete so you will need something under the floor jack in the dirt (?).   Another choice is the car wheel dollys from Harbor Freight that will allow you to continue to move it around as you work on it at home.  These are also not designed for dirt and will need plywood or some better surface to roll on.  You must also take them off the dollys on the trailer.

If you decide to work on on site, be careful because we broke a rusted on drum, trying to get it off a Peugeot.  If you can get it home you have more tools &amp; time to do the job right and finess it.

Good luck
