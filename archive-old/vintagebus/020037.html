Man, that sucks!  At least you're in one piece!

A couple points of consolation:

* the frame piece isn't as big of an issue now (I guess you won't be needed the section I have)

* as-is, your bus still looks better than some of the ones I see running around here!

Did I mention how much that sucks though?
