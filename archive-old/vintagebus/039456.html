&gt;i have seen dubs with a filter beforew and after the pump. guess it cant
&gt;hurt.

A good topic for me to discuss given the problems this particular issue ran 
up for me.  I had a bad gas tank and was pumping alot of filth through 
(pump/carb)  Since then I have had the tandem filter i.e. one between the 
gas tank and pump, and one between the pump and carb.  Guys come on now they 
are extremely cheap and double the protection.  Can't go wrong.
