Rolling across the 520 floating bridge, 4:30 am, doing about 50 mph, notice
what appears to be fog blowing around the back of my '67 camper.  &quot;How
quaint,&quot; I thought, &quot;The morning mist is gathering around the stern, much
as it did during my seafaring days.&quot;  Arriving at work, I noticed the
engine seemed hotter than usual as I walked by, and, worse, there was OIL
all over the back of the bus!

Once I came to, a few moments spent hyperventilating gave me time to think:
 This is a brand new engine, 1776 cc, Gene Berg damn near everything,
machined by the best around, assembled by the best around, scarcely a
thousand miles on the clock and it was LEAKING OIL.

Actually, it was sort of dribbling from the little engine tin pourspout
under the bottom pulley.  Right on to the extractor collector, just inboard
of the exhaust flange.  Lots of smoke.

In the engine room, everything was well lubed, but the heavy stream of oil
that indicates a cooler seal failure was not evident.

Thinking quickly, and since it was too dark to see much, I went in to work.

Later, I called Ken Madson, the guy who assembled the motor, and made
arrangements to bring the bus to his shop.

Fast forward to the present.  Ken removed the fan shroud and confirmed that
the oil cooler seals did not, do not, and likely will not ever leak.  The
area inside the fan shroud is as clean as the day it was assembled.  The
Berg Achiever pulley, purchased at a swap meet, checked out perfect on the
micrometer.  The sand seal, though perfect in appearance, was replaced as
it was at least 10 years old.  Those ten years were spent on a shelf in
Goldendale, WA, and is, at this point, The Prime Suspect.

However, Ken reported that there seemed to be a lot of oil around the
generator stand/oil fill tower when he dismantled it.

Since the engine is out, it was decided to mount a set of Kadrons to
replace the frankly-too-small Weber 34s.  The pressure relief setup on the
Webers was simple:  A hose ran from the fitting under the oil fill cap to
the top of the right air cleaner.

The new setup will use a tee and run to both air cleaners.  The alternative
is a breather box.  

To my questions:

Has anyone ever had this happen?  What was leaking?
Did the pressure relief valves on the bottom of the engine have anything to
do with it?
Does anyone have any experience with breather boxes?
How is it possible for an engine to develop so much pressure?

Other clues:  The day it happened was one of those rare, rare days in
Seattle - it was actually HOT outside.  It got up to 97 degrees, and was
the second of three hellishly hot days.  I drive my bus 40 miles every day
in a safe and sane manner.  The morning 20 is quick, no traffic to speak of
- the afternoon 20 can be a killer, stop-n-go all the way sometimes.

Help me somebody - Ken loaned me his Bestelwagen to drive and I'm tired of
explaining it to people!
