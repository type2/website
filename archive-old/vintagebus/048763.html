Subject: Home-made interior panels

Over the last 2 days I put together and installed some home-made 
interior panels for my '59 Kombi. I got my Kombi with NO interior 
panels at all. So I had to make these from scratch. No templates or 
nothin'. I used &quot;hardboard&quot; (pegboard style material with no holes). 
Quite a few months back I did the hard part of measuring and cutting 
the panels out of the hardboard. I also had found some nice thin 
vinyl material discounted at a fabric store. It had a cotton backing 
on it. I got a lot of grey and a lot of white for about $30 total. 
This leaves me with enough to do all the panels and seats with plenty 
left over to probably be able to do another vehicle. Not too bad.So I 
cut the vinyl and did the 2-tone thing. Grey with white in the 
middle. Cut and sewed the material together.

Yesterday I stretched the pieces of vinyl on a piece of plywood and 
stuck the hardboard to 'em using 3M adhesive. Let them dry that way 
with some cement blocks on 'em. After they dried I trimmed the vinyl 
and wrapped it around with a little adhesive to hold it. My wife 
helped me get the panels in today.

I have to say for a first time attempt home-made job that they look 
pretty darn good. Especially considering I did the whole thing for 
around the $50 range. They in no way look as good as something you'd 
buy ( I assume at least), but they do look VERY acceptable. I can't 
get pictures right now 'cause I need to do it outside in the sun for 
them to come out right. When I do (probably tommarrow) I'll post 
pictures.

Slowly but surely!!!!
