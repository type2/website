I'm currently putting together a bug 1600DP engine from scratch. This should
be close enough to original and have plenty of power. It all depends on how
close to original you want to stay. Looks like it doesn't matter much to you
since you even considered a Subaru engine. I think in this case you should
just go with a Subaru. Just my two cents.

Keep it original.

&gt; I've run different stock VW engines in my buses (1500, 1600, SP, DP,
&gt; etc.), and I'm really happy with the 1776 I'm running now. It is not a
&gt; race engine, but it will keep up with the traffic.
