on the parcel tray of my 67 deluxe,
1 set of fuses
a Peterbuilt patch
a small package of earplugs (for any live music I might go see)
insurance/registration (in a sandwhich baggy, so they dont' get wet)
certain copies of a zine so i can stick them on windows of unknown splits.
and
a box of crayons

(you'd have to ask my wife what's on her's, i'm sure it's pretty tidy)
