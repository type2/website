Subject: GORGEous gathering / Burger Meet, Vintage Meet...

We are going to pass this year on our usual GORGEous Gathering show in
Hood River. The guy who was running the Gorge VW club this year got laid
off and is concentrating on that (which I can fully understand). I was
not willing or able due to short notice to step in and take over for
this season. We very much appreciate all of the people who have made our
show a success in the past and very much look forward to hosting a show
in the future.

As to the Burger Meet and Vintage meet put on by the Cascade Kombis, on
the 19 and 20 of July, I will be there with the Tan 60 Double Cab
(barring any mechanical issues in which case I would be in a White 73
Thing). Come up and say high. The Burger meet is held at the
Burgermaster in the U district up in Seattle. It is my favorite
gathering of the year. No show, No swap, just a couple of parking lots
stuffed full of old VW's and owners talking cars and telling stories.
The burgers are old school and greasy and the chocolate malts are to die
for (enough malt to make them crunchy). Look forward to seeing you
there.

See ya,
Craig
the Gorge VW club
