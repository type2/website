Subject: Heads blowing etc

I took the van to my usual mechanic for a couple of
minor things last week and he advised me that my
cylinder heads are blowing a little, and although he
didn't say it was vital to get it fixed straight away,
he told me it would need a bit of grinding and quoted
me a price.

I (and he) was in a bit of a rush, so I left it at
that, but could somebody fill me in with blowing
cylinder heads? What exactly is happening? Am I losing
fuel consumption/performance/engine life?

On another subject, can anybody advise a good way to
clean up headlining? We've redone most of the interior
of the van; new curtains, cushions, panels and carpet
(see www.geocities_dot_com/~vwsplitty/photos.html ) but the
headlining is really stained and brown, although there
are no rips. I tried some Simoniz Vinyl Cleaner which
had no effect whatsoever. Is there a product that can
get this stuff a bit cleaner? The other option would be
to paint it with something fairly flexible - anybody
tried this option?

Cheers
Chris
