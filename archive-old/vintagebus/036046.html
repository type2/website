Subject: Re: [VB] What's in your garage?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

in my small single garage here in the UK I have three mountain bikes, one 
tandem two road cycles,  two honda st70 dax's one honda z50 monkey bike, 
Honda Cb77 classic racer, Yamaha SRX 600 road bike,
   Lathe piller drill compressor, and junk
 
  so the 55 oval my 65 split bus have to live outside in the British weather, 
so now I DO need a bigger garage
