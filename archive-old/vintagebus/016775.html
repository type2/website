Yeah that  walk through thing kind of got me too.

Just in looking at that bus made me glad my kombi is a driver not a
restoration project. It seems to me that this person had a lot of ideas
for his bus and threw a lot of  $$$ at it and circumstances got the best
of him/her or they inherited it as it is and have over inflated idea of
what the bus' real value is. Ether way this is no way to enjoy a bus.
