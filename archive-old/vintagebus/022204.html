Subject: Swepco 201 - results
Mime-Version: 1.0


I got the 2 gallons of Swepco 201 yesterday, and changed the fluid this
afternoon.  I did the whole system, reduction boxes and all, which is what
you should do for a test like this.

It took about a gallon and 2 pints, roughly.

The transmission: rebuilt unit from carters, 48,000 miles on the rebuild,
always kept in good shape, clutch always kept adjusted, etc.

The results. Shifting is significantly smoother, although the transmission
makes more noise, which I attribute to changing from 85/140 to 80/90.  It's
not expensive noises, just the result of having thinner fluid and solid
transaxle mounts.

Conclusion?  Too early to tell, but my initial test drive seemed good.  I
can even &quot;synchro shift&quot; it easier.

I bought the fluid from AJ-USA (http://www.ajusa_dot_com) and was $38/gal

YMMV
