I used a wireing works harness in the '55, and it was quite nice.
He also custom-fabbed a harness for the '54 RHD.  I'll be dollars to
donuts that aircooled_dot_net and busdepot_dot_com are selling the same exact
harness.  All the mail-order places sell them.

&gt; Where is the best place to get a wiring harness from?  Wireworks?  John
&gt; at Aircooled_dot_net seems to like his.  Ron at Busdepot? (He's got nice
&gt; prices :)
