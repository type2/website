&lt;&lt; What should I look for in gauntlets for welding?  Same question for a mask 
(or is it hood?). &gt;&gt;
Hi Paul,
Best to go to your local welding supply shop and get to acquainted with the 
shop owner and/or workers.  If you have a good shop in your area they are the 
only ones who will be able to supply you with both good quality products and 
knowledge that not only will make your work go easier/better, but could very 
well save your life!  Eric&amp;Barb
