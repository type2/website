&gt;   Price shouldn't really be a consideration on a restored bus, as long as

I agree - I paid a total of $25000 over two years restoring my 67. Parts
and labor, and the Rick Long tranny. Of course, for me it was a labor of
love on a bus that I'd owned for 21 years at that point, plus I got to do
a lot of the work myself, and learned every nook and cranny in the bus, as
well as all the experience using the shop and its tools on the weekends,
when the regular crew wasn't there.

So, one should consider what these buses are really worth, in terms of
their restored condition, compared to what it really costs to restore one
to that condition. If a deluxe bus was on sale for only $10,000 right now,
and I needed or wanted one, that would be a half-price bargain from my
POV.
