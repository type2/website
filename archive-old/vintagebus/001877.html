Subject: Camper of America Conversion info?

I rooted around the archives and Library for a while, but couldn't come up
with much info about this particular conversion.  Does anyone know of any
links, or somewhere for me to start?  I will be picking up a 65 in a couple
of weeks which will likely be in for a major resto.  Thanks
