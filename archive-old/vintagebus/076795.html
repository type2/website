Subject: Re: [VB] VIN locations/ front seat area? 

That sound just like the LHD buses,  if you think that the M code tag is 
behind the front seat on the right side of the bus whether it's the driver or 
passenger seat.  

makes sense... hooray!  :)

In late RHD buses the M code plate is behind the driver seat along with the
colour sticker.

On the airbox on the left hand side is the chassis plate

In the engine bay on the right side engine surround is the chassis no stamp
