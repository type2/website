Subject: Re: mercury light

----------------------------------------------------
The PO of my DC had installed a mercury switch bulb holder on the inside
of my deck lid.  Its wired to my running lights, so if they are on and
you lift the lid, the light goes on...close it and it goes off.  Just
like your refrig, but no mechanical extra switches...it just works:-)

Are these still available??  A very useful and cool accessory.
---------------------------------------------------

  Im not sure about a mercury switch bulb holder but i know a mercury switch
would be something that could be sourced from a car alarm place. They used 
to
use them as hood and rear trunk switches to tell when its open. (one car i 
had
with such a setup, youd hit the brakes and the interior light would come on
becuase the mercury flying around, funny)  My 97 che*vy truck has a simular 
light
thing under the hood that turns on when the hood is open and it has a little 
reel
and a length of wire, id imagine it wouldnt be too hard to find a later 
model
chevy truck in a junkyard to source this whole shabang from..

p.s. personally im a member of the mag light in the mouth club..
