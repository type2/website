Hello Everyone

    (Sound Deadening)

    I just did this my self a few months back and I used an off the shelf
product at Home Depot. It was in a aerosol can and it was a asphalt type
material. I had used it under the bus in those rust areas below the front
seat where water seams to stay during winter. I just had all my interior out
to fix some of the panels and added new material on them. So I tried a spot
of this in the back cargo area and then let it dry. I closed the bus up for
a couple of days and when I opened it back up it didn't seem to have any
real noticeable odor. So I used a couple of cans in the back cargo area and
on the side panel areas. I made sure not to have any rust in the areas I
sprayed and after it was dry I used a 1/8th inch carpet mat and then a short
shag square stitch carpet on top and it really seamed to help cut down the
noise. I also made a seat panel under the back seat and that also cut down
allot of noise. I guess the seat panel has two functions noise reduction and
covers the heater duct.
