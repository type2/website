Hi Michael,
From what we understand the hydralic valves rob the engine of some of it's HP 
to function properly.  Also we prefer solid lifters because adjusting them 
actually acts as a indicator of how the engine is running.  If the engine has 
been running to hot all around or on just one side the valves especially the 
exhaust valves will be regularly too tight due to alot of valve stem 
stretching.  Which can easily result in a broken valve later.  When an engine 
is worn in properly and not run too hot you should only need to adjust two or 
three valves at each tune up due to a little too loose or tight.  What you 
hope is that the normal slight wear of the valve and it's seat, the cam lobes 
and tappets, and the slight stretch of the valves actually will cancel each 
other out on a well built engine.  Even with hydralic valves it is a good 
idea to adjust them every so often to make sure they have not had the valves 
stretch beyond thier ability to self adjust to now longer valves!  Eric&amp;Barb
