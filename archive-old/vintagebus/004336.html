The t-shirt or hat idea is good...........

But if it were to fly, why not see if there is a volunteer in Europe to
print/ship, us, Canada, Australia or whatever?

It seems that there are probably t-shirt making facilities in all these
places and then the shipping would not be an issue.

Just an idea.

&gt; Actually, that is exactly what I thought as well, and the first
&gt; fund-raiser we ever had, we sold T-shirts. This turned out to involve
&gt; tremendous logistics and not much profit.
&gt;
&gt; Take a $5 cap and sell it for $10. Sounds good, until you get a slew of
&gt; buyers from the Netherlands, or Australia. I think it cost around $18 to
&gt; ship an eight dollar T-shirt to Australia, and that was the cheap
&gt; shipping on a freighter. It took three weeks to get there.
&gt;
&gt; So you've laid out 8 for the shirt and 18 for the shipping and you've
&gt; charged 18 because that is the most the market will bear for a lousy
&gt; T-shirt, you're 8 behind and that blows the profit out of the next two
&gt; shirts which you ship to Chicago and Dallas on UPS. All this is coming
&gt; out of your credit card and you are going to pay 8.25% interest on it.
&gt;
&gt; Now you've shipped three shirts for ==nothing==. It goes on like that.
&gt; You can not tell the Australians that it is going to cost them $40 for
&gt; a shirt while the Americans pay $18 because (a) it insults them, and
&gt; (b) they won't buy the shirts then, and (c) they contribute a lot to
&gt; the list and it is wrong to diss them.
&gt;
&gt; Same for the English and the Europeans and the Canadians, their shipping
&gt; is not as much but their Customs are awful
&gt;
&gt; I'm not out to make anybody angry, especially *today*, I like Canadians
&gt; and Europeans and I like Australians a LOT. It's just that we tried it,
&gt; and selling merchandise turned out to be a bad deal for the lists and the
&gt; subscribers as well because of intermural concerns.
&gt;
&gt; FWIW, by historical precedent, any of you who want to are free to
&gt; manufacture type2_dot_com merchandise and sell if for a profit if you want
&gt; to. This could change by consensus but it has been the policy since
&gt; 1996 and is today. We do ask that you not use the &quot;official&quot; type2_dot_com
&gt; logo drawn by Jean-Baptiste le Pesant, because we're not sure we own it,
&gt; and we ask that you don't represent your merchandise as &quot;officially
&gt; sanctioned&quot;. Beyond that, do what you want, and if you choose to
&gt; contribute a share of profits, cool, we could really use it.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;I've suggested this before and nobody was interested - because I think it
is
&gt; &gt;such a great idea I'm a gonna suggest it again.  How bout if someone
made,
&gt; &gt;say, baseball caps, say, in vintage bus colours or colour combinations
and
&gt; &gt;there was an AIRS emblem on the front.  What would it cost to make such a
&gt; &gt;cap - $10.00?  It could sell for, say, $15.00 and the extra $5.00 could
go
&gt; &gt;to the list. Who wouldn't want a nice Mango Green cap with an AIRS logo
on
&gt; &gt;it - damn, I'd take 2.   It would be a little tough for someone like me
to
&gt; &gt;do this - being in central Canada - but, maybe I could check into it if
&gt; &gt;there is an interest.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;1/2 hour before Friday -  easy big boy.
