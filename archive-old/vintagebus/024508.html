Subject: Window frame rust

Jason's post reminded me of a naging problem my 65 Westy will need fixed
when I finish the rockers.  How should I go about fixing the typical
lower winshield seam rust?  Should I cut out the bottom for the frame
and replace  or just neutralize the rust (POR 15) and build up the
seam?  

If cutting and replacing is best, any tips on where/how to cut and
paste??

Thanks.

PS:   Anyone know of a good deal on a plasma cutter?  The best price I
can find is in the $600's (Daytona Mig Pocket Plasma).
