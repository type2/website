Subject: I am with Ellis!  Got water? 

Well I broke down and decided to join in the H2O world of VWs.  I needed a 
work van and decided that a '93 Eurovan would fit the bill.

Pretty nice vehicle that rides well and has good air and heat.  Still no 
power though!!!

Granted the '66 is still staying so no fears there :)

Heck if the wife likes the Eurovan then I might get her a used late model 
one and trade in here sedan.

Take Care,
Adrian Pillow
