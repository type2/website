Everybody's learnin' how, everybody's goin' now, won't you go Safari Sealing with me....
Wanted to test this method before I posted, but we haven't had any rain! It's been pretty tight during the occasional wash, so here it is. 
I melted parrafin and painted it into the seal on the outside of the windows. Microwaves do nothing to paraffin, so get out the double boiler. This stuff is flammable and you don't want it hotter than boiling water. Melt a block or two of household canning paraffin and get a  paintbrush, inch wide or smaller. A masking tape dam at the base of the windows will keep the wax off the nose, don't worry about the windshield. Paint, drizzle, slather it in the space. Fill it in from frame to body. You may need to reheat the wax and add more coats. It tends to shrink as it cools, so add more later. I used a credit card to trim the excess away from the windshield and body. Guess you could get candle tint to get it close to body color, an iron to smooth it down, if that matters. I did mine at warmer temps, 65. It may cool too quickly or get brittle if the metal and air are too cold. The hot wax won't hurt the metal, don't pour it on cold glass. 
No idea how to remove it in the spring, (hair dryer and paper towels?) but my dash is dry and I'm happy. If it works, buy me a beer next time you see me.
