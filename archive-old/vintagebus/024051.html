Subject: re; hot motor fast bus

yes there is a way to go a little taller in the gears just put in a 3.44
r/p a little taller then a 3.88 but more load on engine thus runs
hotter, and there is a better ratio reduction gears got a $1000.oo bucks
ambulance and emergancy vehicals in europe (some of them)
had taller ratio reductions gears to get there faster. check the
reduction gears in your hearse. any way as you saw in my last post, john
and i's trip to phoenix we had no problem overheating, but we could only
cruise at 60-65 with our RANCHO 3.88
trannys.so any way you might have to high a compression ratio in the
1776, when i had my 1776 in my panel it did run a little hotter then my
single port 1600 does now, but no differance in highway speed, just the
hills, sometimes bigger is not better, but i'll keep on trying, next
engine i'm building is a 1776 with big valve single port heads and low
compression, should give me a lot of torque and reliability.
p.s.  1-1 ratio reductions gears probaly would take some machining of
the reduction housing for the larger gear to fit.
