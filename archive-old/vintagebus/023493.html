 &gt;Finally I have all exterior lights, blinkers and
 &gt;high/low beams working.  My westfalia lights will only
 &gt;turn on if the engine is on, probably not wired
 &gt;correctly to the last fuse which is for the interior
 &gt;lights.  
  &gt;&gt;


you mean the light on the side of the bus mby the louvered windows?  You open 
the engine lid and unplug the  black wire from the coil that runs to the left 
and forward.   That one that goes to those interior lights.  now they won't 
work at all (check).  Get one of those VW in line fuse things, use it, and 
hook it up to the hot wire at the voltage regul;ator.  hope this helps
