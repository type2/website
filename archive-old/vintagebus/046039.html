 I need to fit new windshield rubbers (water !).
 
 What is the best way to get the glass in place ?
 
 Thanks

in addition to what Veewee111 writ, do make sure you have a nice clean smooth 
rust free surface on the body.   A new seal wont work so good on pitted 
metal.  Depending on you bus, this may mean either wiping it clean, to 
grinding with a  wire wheel and repainting and spot putty, to even welding in 
patches.  I figure it is a full weekend job with letting the paint dry time 
and all.

I use tar on the body, and oil the edge of the seal, and also oil the slot 
where the string goes in, this last helps the lip be pulled over the body 
metal lip easier.  

Roofing tar cleans up easily with WD-40 and a rag  

I also like to polish and wax the windsheilds, but that's just me.  It seems 
to help the wipers work better.  Besides, the bus runs better if you do that, 
and the dash too.
