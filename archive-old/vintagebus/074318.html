John, I have successfully run rejetted 34 PICT-3 carbs and .009 distributors
since 71 without any problems, except maybe that defective Brosol last year
which I fixed. You can go to a good motorcycle shop and pick up various size
Mikumi jets. With the heavy stuff I haul in my truck up and down the hills
here in the PNW I have found that a 135 main and a 55 air do the trick for me.
I have also swapped a 205G for the distributor from time to time with no ill
effects other than resetting timing. On my 009 I keep my timing at 28 degrees
for the bad alcohol laden ARCO regular gas I use. Altogether, the 009 and the
34 PICT-3 are a good combination for power and fuel mileage for the 1600 DP.

I am considering using the Solex 34 PICT-3 with a 009
distributor on a 1600 DP in a 67 Westy.  I've read
about problems with hesitation using this combination.
 I checked the archives and learned a bit more.  My
questions are 1)where do I get carburator jets (main
and air) if I go with re-jetting and 2)what
distributor should I use with the 34 PICT-3 if I don't
use the 009? Is there a better carb/dist setup?  I
have a 111 205 905M distributor I can use too.  What's
the latest opinion?
Thanks
John Moore
