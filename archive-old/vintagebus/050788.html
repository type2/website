&gt; hmm, the one on my 66 is straight, how late is late?

Hi Chuck,
Is your straight heat pickup tube pointing up or downwards.  Is the tab 
welded on the side of the tube twisted?  As far as we know to fit the right 
side it needs to be the curved one.  Otherwise a straight one can be fitted, 
but it is like square peg in round hole.
According to our bus parts book:
(No picture) 113 129 511 A   
Adapter pipe
from engine No. 7 336 420 (DEC1962)

(Pictured hook for holding the preheat paper tube going left to right across 
the back of the engine.) 211 119 549
Clip (Hook) - Pre-heating connecting pipe
from Engine No. 7 999 652 (17SEPT63 Euro 1200 model)
from Engine No. 302 631(17SEPT63 N. American 1500 model)

(Pictured as bent/curved tube for bolt on #2 cylinder side.) 211 129 511
Adapter pipe
up to Engine No. H 0 150 202 (APR66)

From our copy of &quot;Progressive Refinements&quot;.
2MAY66 Chassi # 216 147 398, Engine # HO 150 203
Carburetor preheating
Now: Hot air from heat exchanger.
Formerly: Taken from underside of the cylinder.

So going by this info:
1960 model year the preheat came off the left stale air heat exchanger.

DEC62 with the introduction of fresh air heating the preheat pickup tube was 
bolted to the #4 cylinder exhaust stud and through the left side of the rear 
tin.

17SEPT63 with the new larger air cleaner on the right side now instead of the 
formerly 40HP only left side air cleaner.  The preheat paper tube is still 
getting hot air from #4 cylinder, but has to go around the rear of the pulley 
to the right side and the new air cleaner.

Somewhere in late 65 or early 66 the curved tube and rear tin with hole on 
right side of pulley used up to APR66.

2MAY66 the preheat paper tube is plumbed into the right side heat exchanger 
through the right side of the forward tin.
