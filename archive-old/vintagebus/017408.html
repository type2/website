Subject: Teflon sealants   (was: Oil Sending Unit)
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hello,
I think that some of the teflon pipe sealants may be
safe to use on oil or hydraulic lines (sealants like
the Loctite stuff in the little white tube--don't
recall the number at the moment.)  Unlike the tape,
which can come apart and let small bits float around
the lube system and maybe plug small oil passages, the
paste type sealants have much smaller particles of
teflon which won't cause those problems. The other
problem, however, is that using teflon (or other
lubricating sealant) on a joint allows you to tighten
it much tighter than a dry joint, leading to possible
damage to the case or other parts.
 
I did use teflon tape on  the bleed screws of the
brake cylinders,  though,just a light wrap so they
won't freeze (rust) tight before I need to bleed the
brakes again (which I try to do annually to clean out
any water or dirty brake fluid from the system).
