Subject: Re: [VB] Belt slippage.

On my part, it is not so much an issue of worries as I find it an
interesting engineering challenge to discover what might really be going on.
The pulley is a smaller diameter, therefore smaller belt/pulley surface area
and less grip, so the slip point may be at lower rpm's than we think.
Especially with the 34mm fan and the additional loading it creates.

Chris

&gt; This whole thing about belt slippage makes ask the question, &quot;what is the
&gt; motor going to be used for?&quot;.  I have a 2017 in a '61 Westy
w/trailer(loaded
&gt; for camping), with the 3:88 FF and 205/75R/15 tires I cruise at 3000-3200
&gt; RPM, 65ish MPH, the highest RPM I shift at is around 42-4300, normal on a
&gt; level road is 3800ish.  Why need a bus motor that'll run 6000 RPM? I
&gt; absolutely have no worries about belt slippage at my RPMs.
