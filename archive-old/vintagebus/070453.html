&gt;I looked in the owners manuals online &amp; the Bentley but have not

&gt;amount of fluid &amp; type of fluid to put in the tranny &amp; RGB's, but how
&gt;do you check the amount in the RGB? Sure the tranny is easy, just fill
&gt;till it is even w/ the bottom of the fill plug., but is there anyway
&gt;to check the RGB, or is it just assumed that if the tranny fluid is
&gt;the correct level, the needed oil for the RGB's make their way to the
&gt;correct level through the axle tubes.

Fill 'em to the top, through the plug.  Clean the crap out before you take 
the plug out.  Fill the RGB ~before~ you fill the tranny.  That stuff flows 
s_l_o_w_l_y -- the tranny will seem full, but a half hour later it will all 
flow out to the RGB and the tranny will be empty...
