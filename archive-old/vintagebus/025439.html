Hi to all !!

I just bought Type 2 micro deluxe.
I believe it is 1967 model, but not for sure.
It is cover with the rust entire body and I found small plate which
shown some numbers.
Due to the rust I could only read &quot;Typ 24&quot; and the number 246174383.
I am not sure if it is a chassis no or not.
If not where can I find chassis no?
Could  some one help me to find out how old is my Type2?

Thanks for your help.
