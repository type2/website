I must say that I regret missing both BBTA and Jerome during the first
year of bus ownership. Frodo the 65 Westy has come a long way in the
last 10 months after 25+ years of slumber but she was not quite up to
the journey. Maybe next year.
The biggest problem I have right now is with the front end suspension.
The bus drives and steers just fine. New shocks. The suspension just
doesn't move. The drivers side is up against the rubber stop and the
passenger side is about 3/4 inch off in the compressed direction. I have
pumped a lot of grease into the fittings. All of them have acceppted the
grease easily and following the advice of Mr Hoovers lately demised
sermons I pumped until I got clean grease. I have applied a reasonable
amount of downward pressure using a jack with the wheel suspended. I
have also driven it for several hundered VERY bumpy miles.I suspect that
if that doesn't break it free nothing will. What I'm looking for are
simple solutions that require no money and little work 8) Seriously now,
Is there any way to isolate what the hang up is without tearing the
front end completely apart and losing the use of the bus for weeks. My
Bently manual shows LOTS of tools I don't have in order to do most of
the work. That scares me. Can I take the torsion arms off the springs
without disassembling the entire front end. I figure that might be a way
to tell which end of the system is binding.

hm- did you read the post i wrote about replacing missing torsion springs in a
63 truck?   that tells how to take the spindles and traiing arms off, and pull
out the torsion spings/leaves.   it is not very complicated or expensive.
that is the bit in the suspension which should springy- and it sounds like
your ride is very uncomfortable.  the thing doesn't move AT ALL?   jump up and
down on bumper and you get nada?    maybe sitting for 25 years introduced
water crud and something rusted in there.   


either 
wait- and hope driving it will loosen it up 

or

pull out the springs and clean out the torsion tubes and make sure there and
no bumps to stick on, clean everything off, check to see the bars flex (?)  

sounds odd.  

with all that sitting there is probbly crud in there

if you have a bently book it should have pictures and instruction too, or
pmail me and I can send you a copy of the post about torsion leaks bars
springs I did
