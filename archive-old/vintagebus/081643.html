Subject: Re: [VB] NEATO Calendar Photos please!

...... For the Nov/Dec issue of NEATO's Old Bus Review I'm looking to do a
2005 Split Window Bus calendar of the worst junk yard photos I can find!...

I don't know whether or not Clara took pictures (unfortunately, I did not),
but she
recently directed me to a VW junk yard near Olympia, WA where, among other
VWs, there was a red SC. It was so surrounded by mature trees, you had to
think it had been there for a really long time. It might have been necessary
to cut down several of those trees to get the SC out. If Clara has a picture,
it would certainly fit your calendar.
