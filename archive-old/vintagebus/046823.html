&lt;&lt; From what Ive seen 62 is a 1 year only walkthrough seat?? Kerry in New
 Mexico had these in his DD and they had a weird bracket that mounted to the
 side of the pedestal for the seat to slide on (drivers side). Do you have
 this bracket also?

Barry has an extra set of these 62 front seats. You can see a picture of the 
driver seat in my 62 DD WT panel by going to &lt;A 
HREF=&quot;http://hometown.aol_dot_com/busrock/index.html&quot;&gt;1962 double door 
model215-080 walkthru panel&lt;/A&gt; 
I would think the pair would be worth $ 40.00-80.00  bucks if you can find 
someone that needs them.  Ronnie, You better stop by and see me when you pit 
stop in NM with the side loader (cool looking bus) or I'll kick your ass.
