Subject: Re: [VB] truck drivers on my road trip :(

As long as you were staying in the right lane no one
has any right to be mad at you.  I have traveled and
European roads are much easier to drive on because
people respect the fact that the left lane is only for
passing.  Only in America will people creep along at
75 mph and force you to pass on their right.  This
problem is especially bad in Wisconsin where people
hauling trailers and boats just LOVE to poke around in
that left passing lane.  One of my best pet peaves and
I have many  :-)  I usually either the fastest or
slowest on the road, depending on which vehicle I
drive and when I drive my bus I keep to the right.

&gt; &gt; well we servived. my wife and i made the trip from
&gt; seattle to chicago last 
&gt; &gt; week and made it. we took a small two lane hwy for
&gt; most of the time, but 
&gt; &gt; then we were forced to take a major freeway for
&gt; the last third of our trip 
&gt; &gt; and were met by more semi's than cars on the
&gt; roads. going speeds of 85-90 
&gt; &gt; mph! top speed for us was 50-55 in our '67 deluxe.
&gt; we were honked 
&gt; &gt; at-followed very closely and at one point
&gt; practically rear ended by a 
&gt; &gt; truck-the driver had to pull of to the shoulder to
&gt; avoid hitting us and 
&gt; &gt; ended up driving next to us - WHILE WE WERE GOING
&gt; 60 MPH! so we got off the 
&gt; &gt; busy highway and stuck to the country highway. i
&gt; know we weren't going the 
&gt; &gt; speed limit, but where is the love on the
&gt; highway?!?!
&gt; 
&gt; Don't let one (or even two or three) bad apples
&gt; paint the rest of the truckers with a bad rep.
&gt; 
&gt; Just about every trucker I've encountered has done
&gt; his best to maintain a harmonious relationship. 
&gt; This is in his best interest, as he is a 
&gt; professional who puts on 50K+ miles per year.  Road
&gt; ragers don't last long in that profession.
&gt; 
&gt; Bus drivers have a better understanding of driving
&gt; low power-to-weight ratio vehicles than the typical
&gt; automobile driver.  This empathy can 
&gt; help us understand where the trucker is coming from,
&gt; particularly where hills are involved.
&gt; 
&gt; Truck drivers rely on their momentum to carry them
&gt; over hills at reasonable speeds.  If something gets
&gt; in their way, such as a bus, they 
&gt; will not be happy campers as they lose their
&gt; momentum and cannot accelerate to regain it.  They
&gt; are now faced with a longer climb and 
&gt; will probably burn a few more dollars in fuel.  I
&gt; keep an eye on the rear-view mirror and try to stay
&gt; out of the way of trucks approaching 
&gt; from the rear.  
&gt; 
&gt; Here in Sunny California, trucks are restricted to
&gt; the two rightmost lanes on multi-lane freeways.  If
&gt; I'm in these lanes (as I usually am) 
&gt; and I see a couple of trucks approaching from the
&gt; rear, one passing the other, I will move to the 3rd
&gt; lane and let the trucks pass on my 
&gt; right (this is legal and normal in California,
&gt; perhaps not in other states).  That way, neither
&gt; loses his momentum and everyone is happy.
&gt; 
&gt; There are situations where you simply cannot get out
&gt; of the way.  Professional drivers understand this
&gt; and shouldn't get hot at you.  If 
&gt; they do, get the name of the trucking company and
&gt; complain to them.  Most trucks carry a truck number
&gt; and sometimes even an 800 
&gt; number on their trailers.  The big trucking outfits
&gt; are very sensitive to this, since aggressive drivers
&gt; cause accidents and lawsuits.  It's very 
&gt; unlikely that a trucker would hit you from the rear,
&gt; as any accident of that sort is regarded as the
&gt; fault of the following vehicle and the last 
&gt; thing a pro driver wants is to be charged with an
&gt; at-fault accident.  Stay in your lane if you have to
&gt; and let the trucks go around, but never 
&gt; drive on the shoulder.
