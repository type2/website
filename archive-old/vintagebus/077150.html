Subject: Christmas Downunder

Hi volks,
It's 38 C or 100 F in the shade here in Sydney today.
We've had fans running all day &amp; had our roast turkey
&amp; pork as cold meat along with countless salads.
Then we spent the remainder of the afternoon in the
pool.
So for those complaining about the cold and nursing a
warming glass of eggnog, keep in mind that here we'd
ALL like a few moments in cooler climes.
I can assure you that reindeer and snow covered
Christmas trees seem more than a little ridiculous
here.
But that aside, have a wonderful Christmas and drive
safe on those salty, icy roads.
Meanwhile I'll simply try to stay awake in the balmy
evenings....
:o)
Cheers &amp; God Bless
