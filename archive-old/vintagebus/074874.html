Subject: RE: Oil opinions

Okay, I did it just because it was too cheap to pass up.

I spent less than 15 dollars for 50 quarts of oil, plus two 120oz bottles of
Green Tea w/Ginseng (from Arizona)

It was at my local Target, I'm not sure if it was just a local store
clearance, but it might be worth it for some other people to see if their
local Target has the Havoline oil at a $.24/quart too!

42 bottles of 20/50 and 8 _at_ 10/30.

At the very least I'll have a lifetime of oil bath oil!!

PS.  I LOVE finding clearance stuff....


---
Someone had has said that I should put my reasons for asking the question
about the oil.

Basically a local store has Havoline 20/50 at 25 cents a quart.
I'm thinking about buying what's left..  (about 20-30 quarts)...

is it a 'buy it now' situation?

-----Original Message-----
I'm sure that this has been covered at some point but I just need opinions
about using various oil grades
What do people think about using 10-30 or 20-50 oil?
any pros, cons, don'ts, do s?
