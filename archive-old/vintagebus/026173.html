&gt;
&gt; Hi Dan-
&gt;
&gt; I have been out of town for the last week so I haven't been able to
let
&gt; anyone know that my bus has been found.  WSP found it last monday on
&gt; I-405 north of Renton, out of gas but otherwise driveable.  They
impounded
&gt; it until my roommate was able to have it towed to our apartment
thursday
&gt; ($255 for towing and impound, very painful). I worked
&gt; on it yesterday and was able to get her running.  The theives pulled
the
&gt; wires off the back of the ignition switch, so that was an easy fix,
but
&gt; they also pulled the wires to the idiot lights out of the speedo.
There
&gt; were also a few things missing, but nothing really important.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks again for all your help-
&gt;
&gt; Tristan
    So ya all can quit looken!    Dan in Renton
