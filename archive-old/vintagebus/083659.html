Subject: Re: [VB] Seat belt retrofit?

Hi Seth,
Best way to do that is to go to a local wrecking yard and take a look at a  
1968-79 bus for where and how the belts bolting points are built into  them.  
We have done this, and cut out the body sections of later  buses to weld into 
our earlier buses.
