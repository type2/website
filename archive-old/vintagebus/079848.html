Subject: Back under a bus after 30 years! Transaxle question. 

After a nice trip from Ohio to North Dakota (chronicled previously), I
changed all the fluids yesterday. The transaxle fluid was low, and the
bottom of the drain pan looked as though I'd been panning for gold. The
bronze or brass pieces are minute--no larger pieces at all. The magnets
on the drain plugs had similar &quot;filings&quot;, lots of them, but again no
larger pieces.

Is this to be expected in a 40 year old transmission with 45000 miles
on it? Or should I start saving up for a rebuild or rebuilt
replacement? Third and fourth do whine some, but again I don't know if
this is to be expected or not.

Thanks in advance,
