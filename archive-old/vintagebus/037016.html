&quot;Sears&quot; sells a wrench for this exact purpose.
EXACTLY like you describe but probably a little bit strudier.
I use it on my bicycle once in a while.
Soak it in mystery oil overnight.
Shouldnt have a problem.
Ive done this one a few fans. 
No broken knobs yet.

&lt;&lt;Good luck - I ended up breaking my knob!

I have an NOS switch, and it turns quite nicely.

&gt; I tried but no luck.  Got out the shop manual, which sez to &quot;screw off 
switch retaining ring&quot;.  There are two small holes in the side of the 
retaining ring or bezel.  I made a little *tool* out of a coat hanger in the 
shape of a &quot;U&quot; and bent the ends in slightly.  I thought this would help me 
turn a 40 year old retaining ring.  I didn't want to force it, I've learned 
something in my years of tinkering with VW's.
