Subject: RE: [VB] RPM/Speed/gears

FYI: I use a little (2 1/16 I think) Sunpro tach that can be bought 
at just about any cheesy chain auto parts store for less than $30. I 
blocked off the screens on my front vent overhang. Didn't want the 
&quot;air conditioner&quot; since I've got the safari's. So i took an extra 
overhead vent panel and mounted the tach up there. This cheap little 
piece of crap reads DEAD ON. I checked it many times with my fancy 
hand-held tach I use in the back to set idle. DEAD ON. I like the 
idea of VDO, but it's hard to argue when you can get something like 
this for so cheap and have it work so well. I plan on adding a few 
more Sunpro guages up there and maybe a gas guage. Reading the tach 
up there isn't &quot;ideal&quot; as people have stated before, but it is not by 
any means a pain. Works for me.

But anyway, makes me wonder if it's the guage. Do you have another 
you can hook up to the same wires?
