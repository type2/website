Comments about my VW's..
DoubleCab - &quot;It was made that way?&quot;
Thing - &quot;I always wanted one of those&quot; (Get one!),&quot;Look daddy, a
Humvee!&quot;, &quot;What is that?&quot;
Electric Thing - &quot;It's electric, really?&quot; (after looking at 6 HUGE
batteries in the back deck)

Robert,
 Good work on the bows. Used to live in Lancaster, CA in the '70's.  I'm
in line, gotta protect the wood! What do you think about having
removeable sections of the uprights so the top of the canvas could be
below the rear window? Up for show, big stuff, down for visibility and
aerodynamics? I'll modify my set.
