&gt; spiders, blaaah, you want something real nasty, how about a ball-o-snakes.

&gt; or last summer when i was working inside my 68 convertible with the top up
and i kept seeing something out of the corner of my eye drop out of the
headliner, turned around and realized it was mice, about 100 of them, they
ate the entire car, &gt;
