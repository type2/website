just came back from puyallaup, wher a number of VWs and there people from the
NW (and some from Calif and elswhere) are congrgating.  show tomorrow, set up
was this evening.  the oregonians are out in numbers.  Eric (of Veewee111)
chastised me for my bad steering in my 61 and even  attempted to remove the
drag link, claiming i was a danger on the road and an accident waiting to
happen etc.   Unfortunaely the drag link obstinately refused and since we all
have to get up early I said lets deal with it later
