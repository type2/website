Subject: Should I Cut Up A Bus?

------=_NextPart_84815C5ABAF209EF376268C8
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII


i'll start off with the busses i have that need sheetmetal: 59 westy- needs 
doglegs, nose, rear corner (left). 58 westy- needs doglegs, right rear corner, 
misc here and there.

i have a 62 DD panel (fat doglegs, flat wheel wells) that is, with the 
exception of the left rear corner and side up to the cargo doors, very very 
clean original metal, rust free and very very straight. it is also in stock, 
unmutilated condition, with about 95% of parts but missing an engine and a few 
other very minor pieces. the left side i spent a week replacing the damaged 
sheetmetal, but it still needs finish work to be done and nice.

so here's the dilemma: i have other, earlier busses that i like more 
and am more motivated to fix. i need sheetmetal that the panel, if cut up, would 
provide, as well as providing other sheetmetal (floors, doors, frame, belly 
pans, etc) and mechanical parts for other people who could use it. the 
nose, right corner, and doglegs on the 62 are really near perfect--no rust, 
no dents or damage of any kind, and the nose has early style headlight buckets 
which would be correct for the earlier busses i own. i need doglegs, and the 
panel has 2 perfect early style ones. 

do i cut up the panel and have people be mad at me for destroying a 
perfectly restorable, very solid, clean, (not including paint) original bus, so 
that my (and others') projects can be furthered along? do i try to sell it and 
probably lose money because people don't want a total project, painted like the 
american flag, for like $1300 and then have to spend an eternity looking for 
sheetmetal i need that, in all probability, won't be nearly as nice as what i 
have from the panel? plus rachel wants it for a future &quot;fantasy&quot; project (a 
Yuengling Beer logo'd panel), which in essence means i get to do all the work i 
don't want to do myself to it anyway in the future.

my problem with cutting up the panel would be that i have at least a grand 
into it as it sits, in need of total mechanical restoration and external 
beautification. i have alot of time, money and effort into it and it still needs 
alot more time, effort, and money thrown at it. it does have some sentimental 
value (which is waning) as it was the first bus i saw in a new mexico junkyard 
that i questioned as to why it wasn't being fixed because it was so straight and 
rust-free, and i spent alot of years trying to get it. i don't really feel like 
investing the time or money into it, because i have other busses that are more 
interesting to me that i'd rather fix and get running first. i don't have a real 
need or desire to add a panel to my fleet, i like 3 window (down the side) 
busses best.

the good part would be i get clean sheet metal, and so do others, as well 
as any extra mechanical parts i don't need from it.

another part of the dilemma is space in the back yard and yet another dead 
vehicle to deal with in the future. i could use the room desperately. my other 
busses could use the metal desperately. i don't need another project after the 3 
i have now. there are a few other mitigating circumstances as to why i want to 
do something soon that i won't go into, but it has nothing to do with 
complaining neighbors.

so, i am looking for some kind of mental direction/influence. i don't know 
if the plusses of cutting it up outweigh the drawbacks. just remember it is MY 
bus, with a title in MY name, and any decision I make is MINE. plus who knows, 
maybe YOU need a pair of nice low hinge panel cargo doors and flat rear wheel 
wells!

input? comments (besides i'm a jerk for even considering cutting up a clean 
bus)? thoughts?

thanks

jon
