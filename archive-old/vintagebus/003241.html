I've got a nice 12v BN4 to sell.  I haven't used it myself, but I was told
it was working in the vehicle it was pulled from (a 12v converted '66).
It's nice and clean, complete...I have a spare fuel pump (status unknown,
purchase as  &quot;good&quot;) and a brand new glow plug as well.  These things seem
to go for around $200, but with the spare parts I think it is fair to ask
$250 for the unit.  I'm selling it because I transferred from here (CWRU,
Ohio) to a school in Georgia for the next semester.  I won't be needing it
anymore for my bus.  The heater is located in Georgia.  I can't get at it
until around December 17 since I'll be up here doing finals so requests for
information will probably be delayed until then.  $250 takes it, all offers
considered.

Nice to be back on the list after a long absence :-)
