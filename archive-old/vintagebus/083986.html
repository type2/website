You you  think that is true with tar based pads?


Hi John,
Anything that rust/water can get under is going to be a problem.  At  least 
the tar pads in themselves should not hold water like those made of foam  
rubber or cloth.
  Eric's Bro In Law just recently got a 1967 bug from a tow yard  auction.  
Both doors have a horizontal line of rust showing through the  outside paint 
just below the door handles.  This was caused due to  using a sound dampener and 
the upper edge of this held dirt like a shelf against  the door metal.  The 
dirt acted like a sponge and held water in this area  till......
  Seeing this we would paint the edges of the sound insulation and  onto the 
metal with roofing tar to seal this area from water and thusly  rust.
  Take a look at a late 1970s bugs in a wrecking yard sometime.   These have 
a thick tar paper sound deadener that is glued to the door panel with  roofing 
tar.  This area never rusts out, even when the rest of the door is  a rusty 
mess.  Same with bug floor pan sound deadeners that are a tar  
paper/styrofoam/tar paper sandwich.  Where this sound deadener is glued  down to the pan with 
tar, it just does not rust on the inside of the pan.
