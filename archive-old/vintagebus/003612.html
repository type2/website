The local chapter of SV2's is putting together an &quot;unofficial&quot; event to
deliver toys to a local news station (in our busses).  The thread about this
event can be viewed at: http://www.sv2s_dot_com/ubb/Forum5/HTML/000010.html
Hope others can join us for this worthy, bus related, event.  Tenatively
scheduled for Dec. 12.

In preparation for the event my wife and I have started to decorate our '63.
We are still looking for some 12 volt or battery operated Christmas lights.
Anyone know where to get them?
