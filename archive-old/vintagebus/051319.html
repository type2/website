Subject: Bus clock help.  any experts out there?

I just recieved my new (to me) 12V dash clock for my
bus.  It seams to work, but i have a few questions.

1.  When the solinoid is activated, it only pushes the
primary tension spring disk back about 45 degree's. 
That is about 1/4&quot;.  The travel on that disk is about
3 times that.  I realize that the solinoid is
basically just throwing the disk back against the
tension spring, but shouldnt it go farther then that? 
I have cleaned all the contacts on the solinoid.

2.  I have the bezzle off (Found a clever way of
removing that W/O damaging it if anyone is interested)
I need to repaint the small center square plate under
both arms as well as the clock arms.  How do you
remove those arms?  Looks like they are pressed on,
but i do not want to venture that far w/o some
guidance.  Anyone ever remove these?

BTW.  My clock is dated 1966 so the face has the
sprung time reset feature if that matters.

Thank for the help.
Matthew
