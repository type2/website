Anyone remember the guy at KP last year with the used rear ribbed bumper for $1100?

&gt; I heard the guy who had the NOS bumper at OCTO marked &quot;SOLD&quot; with a 1000$

&gt; Good news is ambulance fan prices seem to have calmed down.....last year what 
&gt; sold for about 500 is not fetching about 250.

Just like some of the stocks which were trading at 300+ are now trading at $10 -
it's all about speculation and hype.  And I thought I was taking it in the shorts
when I paid $150...
