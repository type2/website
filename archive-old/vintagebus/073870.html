&gt;Are ALL 67 buses supposed to have reverse lights or
&gt;was it just a factory option?
&gt;I have recently picked up a bus with no title, VIN
&gt;numbers tell me it's a 67, but then someone else told
&gt;me that 67's have reverse lights, and this bus has none.
&gt;

I thought that the '67 buses all had the ability to have a reverse 
switch on the tranny and that's the main difference with earlier buses. 
Whether they had them was down to export desination/order preferences.
My friends UK '67 never had them.
