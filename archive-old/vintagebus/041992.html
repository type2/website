&gt; &gt;After the tank is complete, seal it up, then pressurize it by blowing into
&gt; &gt;a vent tube by mouth only.  Seal the tube and wait a day.  Pressure still
&gt; &gt;the same?  If so, you have a winner. If not, time for soapsuds!

&gt; Great suggestions George,,,
&gt; here is my 2 cents
&gt; When I test a tank that only requires a low pressure,, I use a bicycle inner
&gt; tube,, this helps to keep the pressure low enough for safety
&gt; if you cut the tube so that you can hose clamp the one end over the tank
&gt; filler hole, plug the other end and the rest of the holes in the tank , you
&gt; can use a hand pump or use a quick burst of air from the compressor to fill
&gt; the tank thru the bicycle tube schreader valve,,

A good idea!  Most of my tank-building info comes from aircraft
homebuilding sources, and they usually have an altimeter handy for use as
a low-pressure gauge.  You blow a 2000 foot altitude difference into the
tank and then watch the gauge over a period of hours.

Altimeters are perhaps a bit scarce among the VW croud, though!

The important point is that the pressure be kept low.  Anyone who has seen
the &quot;crush the gallon can&quot; science demo knows what havoc can be wrought
by a few PSI over a large surface area.  Quite a few perfect tanks have
been ruined by overzealous testing!
