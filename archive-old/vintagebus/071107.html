Subject: Re: [VB] rubber undercoat in doors?

&gt; that sounds like a great idea. does the vapor barrier go between the body
&gt; panel and the insulation? would por-15 eliminate the need for a vapor
&gt; barrier?

&gt; &gt;&gt;Last fall I insulated behind all my panels with the pink fiberglass
&gt; &gt;insulation from Home Depot which made a HUGE difference in sound
&gt; proofing,


I just finished restoring the doors on the westy so I guess I'll chime in
here.
Like Clara said, the vapor barrier is just to keep your  wood based door
panels from warping from water damage. The panels on there now look like a
fun house mirror because the PO did not use a vapor barrier.
I took the doors of and had the insides sand blasted. cost $40. well worth
it in
time saved and peace of mind that all the rust was removed. Coated the
insides with
Por 15 then installed Dynomat extreme. also took off the kick panels in
front and
gave the nose the Dynomat treatment. Much quieter up front now. And I know
that
my doors will never rust from the inside out. Just scraping the surface rust
and applying
sound deadener over the sheet metal is NOT a good idea. Gotta treat that
rust or it will grow
worse, you just won't see it till it eats all the way through your door. If
you have to use
the pink insulation, put in several Ziploc bags first, then put in your
doors and body
cavities. It will insulate but not hold water.
