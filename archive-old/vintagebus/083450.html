Subject: Re: [VB] $99,000 Westy

I've been driving the 78 too much lately - the ol' 60 has been sitting in the
body shop since ... May - D*mn.

I agree that buses are meant to be driven - but that is a $100K bus - put a
60,000 kms on it and give it a fresh paint job and ... you no longer have a
$100K bus ... but just another bus - worth what 15K? I do not believe that a
restored 66 westy would ever come close to fetching $100K.

That one isn't a resto - its a museum piece.

  I wouldn't be afraid to wearing the rubber on the gas pedal - because there
isn't one on the pedal from the factory to begin with - it's all metal.  Only
Type 1s &amp; 3s have gas pedal rubber pads.

  Why not drive it?  My late father and I daily drove a fully restored (twice)
1950 Split Window Beetle for 20 years (66 to 86).  VWs are made to be driven
and utilized.
