Subject: Re: [VB] Number 2 cylinder

I'm ashamed to admit it but I just figured out the problem, my exhaust to
the right head was not tightened down enough.  I started to take the engine
out to check for head damage or maybe loosening and noticed the exhaust
wasn't tight on the right side.  I tightened it and everything is working
great now. Thanks!
