&gt;Clean all my stuff with cold Castrol  Super Clean parts cleaner, works

That's what I added to the HF stuff, but sitting out in my garage, that
parts bath is COLD!

I boiled a gallon or so of water and added it to the mix, and it made a big
difference - dirt is more willing to wash off with warm water than cold.
