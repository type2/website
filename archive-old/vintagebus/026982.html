Subject: L.A. Bus FS

Hey L.A. and Valley Bus folks, in case you just have to have another
bus, here you go.  (Not you Greg, you have too many already ;-)

I spotted it yesterday while winding down Laurel Canyon into Hollywood.
Its on the West side of the street behind a big chain link fence South
of the top of the hill and North of Hollywood Blvd.  Its a 60's (post 62
I think) Kombi all in primer and has two FS signs on it.  At 30 mph it
looks rough, although all the windows are there and it has all its
tires.  Not sure about bumpers.

If you've been down the canyon, you've most likely seen it since it
would occasionally sit on the street.  Let me know if anyone goes and
looks at it.


Steve
