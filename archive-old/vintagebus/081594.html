Subject: Re: [VB] Rear shift rod coupler replacement

All you need to do is remove the 2 bolts that hold your shifter to the floor 
and then slide your shift rod forward as far as it will go. I did this in 
the dirt at jerome one time, it was not a problem. have also done it this 
way numerous times on other buses as well.

-Wade

&gt; In the Bentley - this procedure for removing the rear shift rod coupling 
&gt; calls for removing the engine &amp; tranny.  My shift rod coupler is in a 
&gt; pretty precarous state and needs to be replaced.  I loosened it up and it 
&gt; almost looks as if it could be removed if maybe I removed the front shift 
&gt; rod and slid the rod up?
&gt; Surely there is a trick to this?
