Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [VB] Questions about the metal fuel line to fuel
  pump in 1600DP

I used a 3 inch piece of fuel line that was sliced down one side.  I placed
that over the metal fuel line and slide it through the tin.  I then placed
hose clamps in front and behind the tin to keep the assembly in place.

&gt; &gt;       I know that the place where the metal fuel line passes through
&gt; &gt; the front tin is an historic problem area, but I believe that there are
&gt; &gt; adequate fixes for this (Bob Hoover had one involving lamp parts and, I
&gt; &gt; think I recall that veewee111 recommends wrapping the fuel line w/
&gt; &gt; bicycle inner tube).
&gt;
&gt; Actually, that one is mine.  A 1 1/2 inch strip of inner tube wrapped
&gt; around the line until it is just a bit larger than the hole in the tin.
&gt; Makes a nice friction fit and if it starts to fail it will take a long
&gt; time to split the entire strip.  The original ones I did with a strip of
&gt; truck inner tube are still doing well over a decade late.
&gt;
&gt; I've never seen a pre-bent tube.  The tube comes from the hole in the
&gt; front tin, passes between the manifold and cylinder tin, and then curves
&gt; around to get a straight shot at the fuel pump.  When I replaced mine I
&gt; just got a length of steel brake line (from a Chevy pickup, IIRC) and bent
&gt; and tweaked it until it was the right shape.
