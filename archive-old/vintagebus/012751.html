Hi all,

I am looking for a copy of a German printed parts catelog that was printed in the early to mid ninties I believe.  My friend Kevin (hey Kevin, do you have the details on the catelog you showed me?) from the list showed it to me and it has a picture of my bus in it.  I would love to pick up a copy or two of this.  I realize my description is vague, but hey, you guys know your bus stuff and should be able to figure it out :)  If anyone has a copy they would like to sell please let me know.  Hopefully Kevin can provide the exact details of who's catalog it is.

Thanks,
Richard
