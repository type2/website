&gt; now, for the kingpin theme song:

&gt; Splitty splitty
&gt; splitty splitty
&gt; It looks like a box but it rides like a truck
&gt; splitty splitty
&gt; splitty splitty
&gt; the front is where you drive, and the back is where you..haul stuff

Clara,

Just wondering what tune that is to be sung to?

And for those of you (who like me) were wondering if Clara passed her poetry
class, go back and read the ditty out loud. ;-))

It was taught to me as the El Camino song, and I changed the lyrics to suit a 
split.  Sung to a dumb nursey rhyme type tune I am sure you can approximate.  
 Many versions abound.   Do not sing it too much or you will annoy people.

buggie buggie,

the front is like a car
and the back is like a duck
bugge buggie
buggie buggie,
the seats are all too small,
and there's no good place to picnic
