&lt;&lt; Is there anything wrong with not using a T-connector for the front lines,

 only need one anyway, and the other one just kinda serves as a plug, or a 
 backup when the other one fails) &gt;&gt;
Hi Mike,
Well yes, and no.  There at least three different makes of dual MC for the 
1971-72, and later buses.  
1. MC has only one upper outlet for the front brake lines, but the upper 
outlet is reduced in diameter before it gets to the threaded part for some 
reason for the front stock disc brakes.  This reduction probably would not be 
good for drum brakes.  Plus a blank cast upper boss on the other side, and 
the one lower 45 degree outlet for the sender in stock application.  
2. MC has one upper outlet, no blank cast boss for the other outlet, and 45 
degree downward outlet for the sender in the stock application.
3. MC has two upper outlets, and the lower 45 degree sender outlet for stock 
application.  We plug the other upper outlet with another brake light sender.

&lt;&lt;This would not neccessitate me finding a T-connector, or an extra sender.  
Is this a no -no?  If so, tell me why, because it seems to make sense to me.&gt;&gt;
      Well doing the way you propose will work as long as you make sure to 
check the the front brakes outlet diameters to make sure they are the same 
diameter as all of the rear circuit.  In our first conversion we took # 1 MC 
drilled, and tapped the blank boss for one of the forward brake lines, and 
redrilled the other upper outlet to the correct outlet diameter size for the 
other side, and plugged the lower 45 degree outlet.  It worked, but if we 
were out on the road, and this setup of MC needed replacing on a long trip it 
would be a real pain to modify #1, or even #2 MC, to the same specs.  So 
instead by looking to the 1967 only brake system we figured out how to make a 
system that could use any of the three MCs without modification to them.  
Because we have not so far found any part shops that happen to carry all 
three MCs at the same time!  We do want anyone to have to wait for a part to 
have to be shipped, or only to find out the part shipped in, or in stock is 
going to need modification.  So we went with the old engineering principle of 
KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid! :)), and came up with a installation design that 
insures the use of the front brakes with any of the three MCs without 
modification to them.  Not to mention having possibly to have to rebend 
either of the forward front brake lines to get them to fit a different dual 
MC, and possibly messing up, or breaking the line even if you install exactly 
the same dual MC.  Requiring replacement of the whole line out to the front 
wheel well.  With the T-fitting if you mess up the about 6&quot; short brake line 
all you have to replace is this short piece!  Lastly we do happen to like the 
second extra brake sender.  There is a good chance that if one goes bad the 
other could be wired up in a jiffy, and still be working to allow one to get 
to the next town to replace the bad one.  We once had a sender go bad in 
Montana, and after getting to a rather large town we found at not the first, 
or second, but at the third parts shop a brake light sender to replace our 
1961 on brake sender.   Use of the rear circuit sender is suggest by us for 
usual operation.  In the future we want to figure out how to come up with an 
easy to install dual circuit brake light system, with check light under the 
dash visible through the speaker grill, into split screen buses.  Eric&amp;Barb
