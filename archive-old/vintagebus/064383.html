Subject: Heater Tube Cover and Oil drip gone

Until somebody makes a repro cover, I came up with a new &quot;high tech&quot; solution. Found an insulation product called AyrFoil at my local hardware store. It is a plastic air bubble sheet sandwiched and bonded between two layers of aluminum sheeting providing a radiant heat insulation factor. I wrapped this around my center heater tube and sealed the seam with the two inch wide adhesive aluminum tape provided. I made sure it was also sealed at the front and back so that no dirt could get under the insulation while driving. Three 1/4&quot; holes at the center and both ends were also made at the bottom insulation to the surface of the tube to allow any moisture condensation to drain out.Total cost under $30 Cdn and heat now coming out of front dash is a lot warmer. I have noticed street rodders around here this summer have been using this product also for sound and heat insulation on their projects.

And finally eliminated the two oil leaks at the front and back coming from the oil pressure relief valves on my 1600 cc dual port. I found both metal crush rings that seal to the plugs to the case had their seams facing up against the engine case. I got some new ones and flipped them so that the seam is now on the bottom, sealing against the surface of the plugs when they are screwed into the case. I also used some liquid teflon on the bottom three threads of each of the screws. Problem solved.. no oil drips at all now from the engine......for now....
