&gt; Subject: VoA Show on Amelia Island, Florida  Oct 23-25
&gt;
&gt; Hello Everyone!
&gt;
&gt; There is a show in my hometown next weekend Oct. 23-25. The show is called
the &quot;Volkswagen Heritage Classic Car Celebration&quot; and is located on historic
Amelia Island, Florida (30 miles north of Jacksonville). This show started

five years ago as just a few vintage cars parked downtown.  Last year, the
entire downtown area was packed with enthusiasts and vehicles.  Due to this
huge turn out last year, organizers were able to get Volkswagen of America as
a sponsor this year!!  This could also be because my friend's stock '65 Type 1
took &quot;viewer's best of show&quot; out of 200 cars, the majority being American.
&gt; This is a wonderful show and a great weekend. Anyone in the NE Florida/SE
Georgia area should definitely try to attend.  For more info, contact me or
1-800-2-AMELIA....www.ameliaisland_dot_com
&gt;
&gt; Here's what the poster says:

&gt; PS: Would anyone be interested in camping?  There is a great Civil War Fort
called 'Fort Clinch' on the Island with wonderful camping facilities.  If so,
I can get together a handful of locals and we'll all camp and make a cool
daddy weekend out of the event... :-)
&gt; If camping is a turn off, then we could all convey over to the Ritz Carlton
(also located on the Island), and demand a group discount for Splitty
owners....I'm sure I can talk then down to like $500 a night or so :-)

Thom
