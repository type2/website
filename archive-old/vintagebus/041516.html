&gt; Check out the link below...Im thinking of painting a logo on my singlecab.
&gt; Any suggestions???
&gt; Does it look stoopid?
&gt; Its paint so its not going to come off too easy.
&gt; Looking for a &quot;yeah&quot; or a &quot;neigh&quot; before i break out the vinyl cutter and the 
&gt; paint gun.
&gt; Any suggestions for the rear? Im thinking &quot;sales service 818-555-1212&quot; or 
&gt; something.

Well, that telephone number would get them information in the San Fernando
Valley of SoCal.

So as not to confuse the populace (and to keep with the heritage of the

doesn't do much business in the US. Telefunken leaps to mind, but there
are many others.
