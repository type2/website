Subject: survey: Whistling vent wings?

Just wondering, anyone who replaced their vent wing seals, does it whistle or not?  Friend stopped by yesterday in his DD 23 window (started life as regular 23 window... long story) and it has all new seals a couple years ago.  He said ya, the vent wings whistle.

Anyone have them not whistle?
