Well, the spec is 40-47 ft-lbs.  All you have to do is hold the fan nut
with a long breaker bar and tighten the pulley nut to that spec.  Both
nuts have the same spec, despite the large hex on the fan nut.  I don't
see much of a problem doing that.

It certainly beats the heck out of trying to get the shroud properly
positioned after you lift it!
