&gt;Well, my light Switch on my 1967 21 DLX finally gave up the ghost.

Did it completely crumble into bits or just quit working?  They are
fairly simple inside, and have riveted connections that can loosen
up - Eric&amp;Barb have good advice on opening the switch up by drilling
out the two larger rivets that are 180 degrees apart on the housing
and soldering the connections.  You will need a big soldering iron,
like 100-150 watts minimum.  My 100W one just barely cut it.  Even
if yours is totally thrashed, you may be able to fix up one from
a swap meet.

&gt;Calling around (WCM, Wolfsburg, etc.,) I find that there is no 
&gt;replacement (or repos) yet for my 67.

The '68 parts list ( http://home.cwru_dot_edu/~agw4/docs.htm ) gives a
part number of 211 941 511D for '58-'67.  They do list different
knobs - 113 941 541, silver beige, through '66, and 113 941 541 B,
grey black, '67 and up.  The knobs just screw on and off the front
of the switch, so you could swap your knob onto a new switch if
you needed to.  Jbugs lists the switch in their catalog and Wolfgang
lists both knobs.
 
&gt;Any comments, guidance or even cuss words would be greatly appreciated.

Ach! Schalter!!
