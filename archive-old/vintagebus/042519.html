it says at the top &quot;if you can drive it we want to see it&quot;

but there is no &quot;beater&quot; or &quot;beast of show&quot; type category...

I'm one of those guys with an ugly bus and proud of it, and usually wont
eneter a show without a class for the likes of me, you could even make it
a class for all cars (bus,bug etc.) just ones that are beat down... or
have it be a peoples choice type thing...

My 2 favorite shows were Junebug jamboree in Springfield MO and the
eureka springs show in the ozarks because they have these categories.
Busses by the arch is great too because it has a &quot;most in need of repair
or restoration&quot; peoples choice award.

However i just got the preregistry form for The Junebug Jamboree and they
Politically Correctified the Beater category into &quot;cosmetically
challenged&quot; so now if i win again my trophies wont match... Kind of
dissapointing but oh well...

take care,

Steve
