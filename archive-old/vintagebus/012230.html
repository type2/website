Subject: redux bearings update
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hello Friends,

James got the bearing loose with a cold chisel and a hammer. I guess I just didn't have the guts to hit it hard enough.:) Listees Raistrick and Gibson came over to supervise... We got the redux put back together, filled with dope and the engine jacked back in. Still have to hook up a brake line, bolt everything back together and wire it up, but decided to hang it up for the night, as my sister's headlights were getting dim...
