Subject: Re: [VB] Hello, newcomer here with some quick questions

Generators and regulators must be Polarized.
Remove fan belt, Connect DF to ground and
+12 volts to D+, generator will turn clockwise
like a motor. Don't ask why.
Regulator- Flash B+ ( or 51 ) to D+ ( or 61 ).
with a piece of stiff wire. See spark. Done.

&gt; &gt;First of all, I have been told that there is no way to test the
&gt; &gt;generator or regulator to see if they are functioning, I find that
&gt; &gt;hard to believe, anyone know how I can check them?

&gt; The only time this is true is when you are in the business of selling
&gt; generators and regulators.  :)  Yes, there are many checks you can do.
&gt;
&gt; The simplest test is to measure the battery voltage with everything
&gt; shut off; you should have 12.6 volts on a fully charged battery.  Then
&gt; start the engine, rev it up to around 2000 RPM, and re-check the voltage;
&gt; it should have gone up at least a volt to 13.6 volts or more at the
&gt; battery.  If you see this, your charging system is at least trying;
&gt; if you don't get any increase, try goosing the engine a little more --
&gt; but you should definitely see something by 3000 RPM.  If not, your
&gt; charging system isn't working.
