I tried to go your site&quot;dumpthesump_dot_org&quot; but i was una
ble to locate your server. Did it overheat in the
middle of nowhere? :)

Take care

&gt; You're risht, Type 3's had the larger tins that look

&gt; While T1's and T2's had the smaller, triangular
&gt; piece. 
&gt;   For those that don't know they fit on the
&gt; underside of 
&gt; the barrels in the space between them, against the
&gt; case, 
&gt; pointy bit towards the head.
&gt;   Without one of these the cooling air would flow 
&gt; straight down and out, causing the barrels to run
&gt; much 
&gt; hotter. When installed they force the air all the
&gt; way 
&gt; around the bottoms of the barrels, cooling much more
&gt; 
&gt; effeceintly. 
&gt; 
&gt; More bad ascii, looking down the cylinders:

&gt;   I believe that all type 1 aircooled motors came
&gt; with 
&gt; one style or the other!

&gt; &gt; &gt; I would add:
&gt; &gt; &gt; -  potential loss of pickup tube and oil
&gt; starvation!
&gt; &gt; &gt;    Since whoever built John's motor neglected to
&gt; &gt; &gt; install
&gt; &gt; &gt;    such basic cooling components as air
&gt; deflectors,
&gt; &gt; &gt; do
&gt; &gt; &gt;    you think they took the time to properly
&gt; install
&gt; &gt; &gt; this
&gt; &gt; &gt;    sump?? 
&gt; &gt; I thought the &quot;air deflectors&quot; (pieces of tin that
&gt; are
&gt; &gt; secured to the bottom of the cylinders) where
&gt; found on
&gt; &gt; Type3's orginally and had to be added to the other
&gt; &gt; types. If that tin is original he never had it to
&gt; &gt; begin with. The picture is bad but i do see the
&gt; lower
&gt; &gt; tin that attaches to the case and heater box.   
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; -  cost of sump, cost of additional oil at every
&gt; oil
&gt; &gt; &gt;    change
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; At less than $2 a quart, and purchase price of
&gt; about
&gt; &gt; $30 for the sump i would say cost is minimal.    
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; -  Oil leaks where the sump mounts
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Blame the mechanic not the sump.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; -  risk of some road debris shearing it off
&gt; &gt; Possible but not very likely unless you lower your
&gt; &gt; car, and why would you do that anyway. :)
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; &gt;   Didn't Kyle have an engine grenaded by one of
&gt; &gt; &gt; these??
&gt; &gt; &gt; mounting nut sucked into pickup or somesuch?
&gt; &gt; I have never heard of that before. It is possible
&gt; but
&gt; &gt; it sounds like a poor assembly job to me. Key word
&gt; &gt; LocTite!
&gt; &gt; &gt;   If you have a hot rodded, non-stock motor you
&gt; may
&gt; &gt; &gt; need
&gt; &gt; &gt; extra oil capacity as the oil could be pumped
&gt; out
&gt; &gt; &gt; faster
&gt; &gt; &gt; than it can return to the sump. I run a mild
&gt; 1776,
&gt; &gt; &gt; don't
&gt; &gt; &gt; run high revs and check the oil level at every
&gt; fill
&gt; &gt; &gt; up.
&gt; &gt; &gt; For my situation the risks and added cost
&gt; outweigh
&gt; &gt; &gt; the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; benefits, YMMV
&gt; &gt; I run a stock 1600 in my bus with a full flow
&gt; system
&gt; &gt; and heavy duty oil pump. It's a system that has
&gt; never
&gt; &gt; let me down. 
&gt; &gt; By the way if anyone needs a sump i can be reached
&gt; at
&gt; &gt; www. iLOVEVWsumps_dot_com, just kidding. I just think
&gt; they
&gt; &gt; are worth the money.
