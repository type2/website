&lt;&lt; What size tires do I put on my 63 Kombi (bearing in mind I'm slowly 
turning it into a camper).  &gt;&gt;
Hi Stuart&amp;Sherri,
&gt;From MAR55 to NOV63 used 6.40 X 15&quot; (About 27&quot; diameter.) bias tires.  Now if 
you are asking what size radial tires one can use to get as close to stock 
diameter.  You can use a P205/75R15 size which is about the biggest one can 
use in the front and biggest you can use in the rear up to AUG62 buses.  
Since you have a 1963 bus (Hopefully correct year ID.) you have the later 
wider and higher rear wheel wells that were used up to AUG67 you can use 
215/75R15. 225/75R15, or even a 235/75R15 on the rear axle and reduce you 
RPMS in the higher gears/MPHs.

&lt;&lt;One thing I learned from the archive is to get a non-passenger load tire 
and go for the light truck tire.   &gt;&gt;
Yes, no.  Some passenger tires have stiffer sidewalls than some wimpy truck 
tires.  Main thing you want to ask for is a radial with a stiff sidewall (The 
stiffer the higher the load rating!) and narrow as possible profile.  
Different manufactures of tires use the same measurements, but result in 
slight important differences in overall diameter and widths of these even 
though the size ratings are the same.

PS If you are using a stock interior spare tire position you will probably 
have to use a 165R15 (Preferrably with a 86S designation for 
stiffness.)radial tire as a spare to get you to the next town for repairs.  
The larger radial tires will be too wide for most buses in the stock spare 
position except for the bench seat 1955-59ish buses.   EEE&amp;B
