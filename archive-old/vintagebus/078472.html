Subject: Re: [VB] windshield leak &amp; Ospho

Well, It's hard to tell how bad it is when the windsheild in in.   Wire 
wheels on drills or grinders can help with the work.   Good luck... take time for 
each layer to dry befor eapplying the next.    

If you reach up from underneath to feel the bottom of the windhsiled ledge, 
you can get an idea if there is tons of rust through or not.   

Hey, has anyone used ospho?   to remove rust?

Clara, all,

When the DPO was &quot;fixing&quot; the windscreen ledges in my bus when he owned it, 
he used some fiberglass shmoo that leaks and looks like ass from the outside.

He was so damn proud of himself for that move, and the do-it-yourself window 
tint he put all the way around.

I loved telling him about peeling it all off.

All that, and the lowering and crappy car tires and my bus was on the fast 
train to hooptyville.
Luckily I stepped in in time.

I'm wondering if I'll be able to get the fiberglass off when I go in there.

Also, what about repair?  Is someone selling the metal bits, or will it have 
to be a shop fab?

Took my kids to La Brea this summer. Totally awesome.

Billy

&gt;Roofing tar is good for your bus,  and it smells &gt;like La Brea Tar Pits. 
Take your kids to see all the &gt;neat ancient bones there.  from dire wolves and 
&gt;woolley mammoths and critters like that.
