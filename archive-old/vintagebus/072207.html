There is a sound that I usually relate to some old &quot;beater&quot; car.  Maybe a
car whose engine is too hot or low on oil or ???? It is a rattle like
sound.. metallic sound .. not a loud noise and really hard to describe, but
in any case I would hear it in OTHER cars but never in a VW .. well ... I
heard it in mine.  I had been driving for a while and I heard it in 3rd
gear.  I probably should have been in 2nd.  Strange I thought ...
so I turned down
the idle myself .. the rattling .. ticking ... beater car sound went away ..

could be lugging, if you were in too high a gear.  That is real bad for you 
main bearings. 
 the other thing I was wondering was , was it a pinging noise? that could be 
from timing a tad advanced.  but I don't see how the idle would change a noise 
like that, except sometimes buses make noises at certain vibrations, like the 
side table rattle at a certain speed,  and maybe chnging the idle changed the 
vibration   ??????????????
..................===============.............

&gt; The sound is gone and my question is ..
do you recommend a cylinder head gauge ?? I had one on my 71 bus.  Of
course, the &quot;mechanics from hell&quot; disconnected it and said it wasn't needed
.. even when I told them to re-connect it they didn't ..  There is another
type of temperature warning &quot;thing&quot; that connects to the oil stick.  Makes
your oil and gen lights flash when the engine reaches a certain temp.  I
LIKE IDIOT LIGHTS .. I check my oil once a week when I fill up so it isn't
low oil that concerns me, it is a hot engine.
..................
I like guages too.   I run a oil temperature and pressure guage, but not a 
head temp guage.  The dipstick thing would be the gene berg warning light, when 
the oil temp is too hot (225?  230?) it makes the oil pressure light flash.  I 
think you just put this in instead of you dipstick, and run a wire from it 
over to the oil pressure sender.   Is that right anyone who has one?  seems 
really easy to install.

Ya, you don't NEED guages, but I think they are nice extras.  I check my oil 
every time I put gas in. FWIW.  You can always do the spit test, spit on the 
engine case.   if it sizzles or bounces away immediately, the engine is too 
hot.  if it kinda sizzles, it's okay, fully warmed up.
