BBB IV was great, definite must-go event, met a bunch of cool new people and
chatted up old friends too.  People were looking to meet me, I feel
important.  :)

Cruised out there in the '55 Kombi (of course) with rebuilt generator and
rebuilt fuel pump, no problems save a tiny generator stand oil leakage.  The
primer in my engine compartment looked a bit clean anyway, can't have that.

Same old good stuff - Kyle aka &quot;Big dollar Westfailure&quot; with his &quot;you
stepped on my carpet, drink,&quot;  picked up a few things in the swaps but
apparently missed a Barndoor shop manual (!), showed off the Bus to the
&quot;Hey, it's a Barndoor&quot; crowd which I love to do, of course, and cruised home
the scenic route at 50 mph with Earl (entertaining as always), Dan (cool
guy, nice Bus), Sean, and Matt &amp; Katie (Dammit Jim, I've got to have more
fuses!) &quot;stuck&quot; behind me.

I'll be out at OCTO this weekend, I know someone wants to bring some
Barndoor reflectors and a Huf ignition key blank for my Bus...

Ah, good times,
