Steve,
I am in the process of making curatins for my westy now. I have the
measurements at home and can provide them for you later this afternoon.
I found the slides and the corresponding snaps for the windshield curtains
at an RV supply store, and if you need shock cord for the bottoms of the
windows you can get that material at an RV store as well, or buy some thin
bungee cords.
Does your camper have the slide channels at the top of the windshield?
I don't know whats used to hold the windshield curtains at the bottom of the
windshield, do you know?

&gt; What i'm looking for:
&gt;
&gt; - top to bottom measurement
&gt; - left to right measurement
&gt; - how wide is the fold over for the top curtain rod
&gt; - how wide is the fold over for the bottom shock cord
&gt;
&gt; Since they are all the same, that makes life easier anyway.  Since i dont
&gt; have an OG westy rear window curtain rod or front spring thingies,  i'll
&gt; have to fudge those anyway...
&gt;
&gt; thanks a lot!
&gt;
&gt; Steve
