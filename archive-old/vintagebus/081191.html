Subject: [F] any UK listees want to get me some beer?

after working on the craptacular aluminum motor last night, i settled 
in with a nice st. peter's cream stout.... now i need a bottle of 
their king cnut (made with stinging nettles!), but their u.s. 
distributor doesn't carry it.
i can't think of a better beer for drinking after working on the POS 
aluminum case - unless they have a beer made with poison sumac.

perhaps there is a yank beer you want, and we could swap.
