Yes, but there's a very limited supply of originals, and 
just about any set of OG safaris is going to need a lot of
work.  So from the effort standpoint, it's a slight
advantage to the CE safaris.  In the Availablity category,
CE once again has the advantage, and Price makes it a hat trick.

Not many people have the patience to wait for a set of OG ones
to come their way, or the funds to buy them, or the parts stash
to restore them.

If you don't like the aftermarket safaris, at least look at it this way:
the availability of good aftermarket ones has reduced the demand 
for OG ones, making it easier for the AR types to get their hands
on them.

I have a set of OG barndoor safaris, and am not looking forward to 
all the hassle of trying to split the frames and all the other resto
work.
