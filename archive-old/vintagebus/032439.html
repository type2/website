I have to say that E&amp;B's suggestion of removing the pick-up tubes and 
switching them around is by far the simplest way to go. Did this personally 
the other night in about 5 min. with out having to go anywhere. The tubes 
are just set into a tapered hole and are easily removed and then gently 
tapped back in.
