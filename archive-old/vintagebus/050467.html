&gt; Ahhh, Friday!
&gt; Let me start by saying that I am not now, nor have I ever been a motorc=
ycle rider. Down the street from me there are a couple of guys who are Ha=
rley Davidson bikers. Nice enough guys, but those bikes used to just kill=
 me.  They go rumbling by all night making ALL THAT NOISE! I have never u=
nderstood the appeal of the Harley. Then last night a buddy came over to =
the house to show me his &quot;new&quot; Harley soft tail. It was loud, way too exp=
ensive, and he says that you really have to baby them and give them a lot=
 of maitenance attention. So I asked him why not spend HALF the money, ge=
t a honda or kawasaki bike in better shape that requires less maintenance=
 and runs quieter.  To which he promptly responded: &quot;Well, why don't you =
get a Ford Aerostar or Plymouth Voyager Mini-van that runs quieter, is mo=
re reliable, and requires less maintenance than all those VW buses?!?!&quot;  =
 Ahhhhhhh, NOW I GET THE HARLEY APPEAL!!!  It's about style, it's about t=
ruth, it's about hitting the open road and b!
&gt; eing different!  If I ever decide to buy a motorcycle, I think I'm gonn=
a get a Harley!
