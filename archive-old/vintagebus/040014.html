Subject: Threatcon Definitions

For those who do NOT know what all this &quot;threatcon&quot; lingo means, and are not 
familiar with terms like &quot;Alpha, Delta, Charlie&quot; (phonetical terms for the 
letters A-D), etc. here's a quick guide. The only deviation from this guide 
is where a specific THREATCON should be for the &quot;local area&quot;. In this recent 
attack, it is unclear to future attacks. That's the reason for hightened 
security across the globe. Here are the five THREATCONs:

THREATCON NORMAL: Applies when there is a general threat of terrorist 
activity, but warrants only a routine security posture.

THREATCON ALPHA: Applies when there is a general threat of possible 
terrorist activity against personnel and facilities, the nature and extent 
of which are unpredictable. Circumstances do not justify the implementation 
of THREATCON BRAVO measures, but certain measures from higher THREATCONs may 
be neccessary based on intelligence reports, or as a deterrent. Installation 
must be able to maintain this THREATCON indefinitely.

THREATCON BRAVO: Applies when an increased and more predictable terrorist 
threat activity exists. Installations must be able to maintain these 
THREATCON measures for weeks without causing undue hardship, affecting 
operational capability and aggravating relationships with local authorities.

THREATCON CHARLIE: Applies when an incident occurs or when intelligence is 
received indicating some form of terrorist action against personnel and/or 
facilities is imminent. These measures are intended to be short term; 
maintaining them for a long time will probably create hardship and affect 
the peacetime activities of the unit and its personnel.

THREATCON DELTA: Applies in the immediate area(s) where a terrorist attack 
occured or intelligence indicates terrorist action against a specific 
location or person is likely. Normally this THREATCON is a local condition.
