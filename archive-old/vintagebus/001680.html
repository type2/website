Hey Volks

Last week I got a phone call from my ex-mother-in-law asking if I wanted a
Kombi tent, something I've been looking for for a while now, but didn't want
to pay the price for a new one.

I said &quot;sure, how much?&quot; and her response was: &quot;oh, a box of chocolates&quot;.
Well, I didn't need a second invite. What I got for a box of chocolates is
an old drive-away tent, in excellent condition. The design is specifically
meant for use with a VW Bus. All it was missing were the pegs and one guy
rope, which I picked up from a camping shop. I tested the tent this past
weekend on a short camping trip with my girls and a couple of their friends
and the 63 Dormobile.

The tent passed the test with flying colours, and the girls thought it was
the best thing since Dormobile roof bunks.

The tent previously belonged to my late ex-brother-in-law. Paul Barale was a
split-screen bus owner for many years. He never got the chance to use this
tent before he was shot dead by robbers in his driveway last June. So this
message is a memorial to a fallen bus driver. I will think of Paul every
time I use this tent ... maybe some of his spirit will accompany us on our
future bus camping trips.
