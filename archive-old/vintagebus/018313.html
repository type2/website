The check strap keeps the forward door from whacking the front door.
All my buses have only had check straps on the forward cargo door.
One should leave the check strap hooked to prevent some gomer from
banging the cargo door into the front door when he's playing with your
bus.  The boo-boo I'd like to figure out how to prevent is when people 
don't close the cargo doors in the proper order.  Some betty did that
to my panel at one of the shows, stripped off the paint at the top.  Grrr.

Here's a good one: ever seen a &quot;late-model&quot; RHD bus?  Notice how
it has the handle recess that prevents it from hitting the front
ca door, on the *rear* door, even though there's no door for it to hit?

&gt; List- Please help me to answer this question (its bring driving me crazy for 
&gt; several years now): you know panels,kombis, standards,and probably others 
&gt; were equipped with rubber bumpers mounted to the side of the vehicle that 
&gt; served to protect the body from damage when one of the vehicle doors was 
&gt; opened AND were also equipped with check straps on the side cargo doors. On 
&gt; the other hand, DeLuxe buses were equipped with the check strap ONLY to 
&gt; obviously protect the side of the vehicle (in this case the aluminum 
&gt; beltline molding) from damage. Now my question- why were the non-DeLuxe 
&gt; buses equipped with BOTH rubber bumpers AND check straps???
