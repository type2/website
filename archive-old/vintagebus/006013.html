Well tonight I finally got started working on converting this good used T3
engine for my 66 bus.  I figure while I'm waiting for the loan to get
approved for the addition to the driveway, I can be 'working' on my bus.

Before I get into this too much, I'd like to ask if anyone knows what T3
this engine would have come from.  The engine was originally FI and the
number is U5003468 and it is a dual relief case.

Well I sprayed it down with carb cleaner (it had been cleaned already at the
car wash but I missed some spots) and using the wire wheel and air gun was
able to get the engine cleaned good enough.  The previous owner claims he
had 1000 miles on new heads and by the looks of the pushrod tubes (they are
nice and shiny) and new seals, he wasn't lying.  Unfortunately, I found out
that #4 has been helicoiled and since I HATE helicoiled heads ( I had one on
my Westy and it was a PITA), I'm probably going to have to replace it.  I
know old ford plugs are extra big and I'm wondering if I can just drill and
tap the head for a ford plug and use an odd plug.  I'd settle for this if it
would work (has anyone tried it?)  I'm going to be running Weber 40IDF's
with ratio rockers and I have no idea what to run for a bus exhaust - I
might settle for a bugpack muffler as that was what my Westy ran and I liked
it.

Moving along with the conversion from T3 to T1, I installed a step stud
where the oil cooler is going to go.  Then I removed the T3 oil dipstick
tube/filler and installed a bugpack T1 oil dipstick convertor.  It bolted
right up (although I had to make my own gasket.)  I also found out that the
studs for the fuel pump aren't long enough to reach through the plastic
spacer and up thru the pump so that you can get studs on them.  I took care
of that by replacing them with some long 13mm studs I had laying around.
All that's left in the actual conversion is to drill out the boss for the OP
sensor and the 2 small 10mm bolt holes for the oil cooler adaptor.

Now I'm going to be running a 6V generator in this bus (although I'd like to
run a 6v alternator if there was such a thing for a 66 bus) and am hoping
that I have the right gen. stand for it.  Mine is part number 113.101.211
(can anyone confirm this?)  It's got a filler with only one tube coming out
the top (no road draft tube.)  Does anyone have a good used 6v generator
that they would like to sell.  I could sure use one.

I also proceeded to change the oil sump screen and gaskets but that was no
biggie.  I then added 3 qts of Hyde 10w-30 oil just to flush things out
since the engine has sat for a while.  I packed some rags around where the
oil cooler is supposed to go and started turning the flywheel with my 36mm
socket.  After several turns, sure enough, here came the oil, a little milky
at first and then pretty clear after 10 seconds - everything looked decent.

To top it all off, I decided to see if my crank-start pulley nut would fit
and it does - that will be cool!

One more question and then I gotta hit the sack tonight.  Does a 66 bus use
a squared off or rounded engine tin in front of the cooling fan right above
the tranny and flywheel?  I know my 71 Westy used a boxed shape piece of
tin.

Sorry for the long post but I'd appreciate some replies.  Thanks all!
