Look like pick on thom night:
What I meant Thom, was after you totaled both and collect you can buy a nice
FORD truck and trailor and tow your RHD BD around to the shows that don't
have Buses By in them and have a guess how many rust holes in it contest and
raise money to get it fixed, a buck a pop and you are set.
 My challenge to Thom is: Take 2 days off ( fri and mon) and drive 1 of your
buses  ( not the FORD)to the Classic Weekend in June and I will pay your gas
money 1 way. Maybe you can get more sponcers and get a free trip. What do
you say?
