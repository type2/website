&gt; What I have found with my master cylinder-is that it looks really old, very
&gt; quickly. The fluid inside(the brake fluid) is hygroscopic and super toxic(i
&gt; think that is what it's called) anyway I think this stuf causes the master
&gt; cylinder to rust in an aggresssive fashion, which makes them appear older
&gt; than they are....

       I agree; 
      
       I spoke with the PO and he said that the master cylinder was replaced 
some time ago. So, is there any way to determine if there is a problem with 
it, or do I have to take it apart (something that I really don't want to do 
if I don't have to)? :)

       Thanks again!
