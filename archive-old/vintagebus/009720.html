I bought safaris from Izzy. I had a body shop install them to 'get it right'
One was so out of shape, there was no way to keep it from leaking.
Ol' Izz promised to replace it. I kept after him for a year, heard
everything from somebody having cancer to getting new dies made.
Finally said to hell with him &amp; they still leak.
So, guess what, I DON'T RECOMMEND IZZY'S SAFARI WINDOWS.
