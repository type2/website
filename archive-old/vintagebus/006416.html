&gt;the plastic putty knife is stiff enough to scapre undercoating off (after
it
&gt;has been softened up by the orange stuff) plus it doesn't scratch the
paint.


This is a real good point, a metal putty knife or razor blade will easily
gouge on the edges, a nice hard plastic knife won't.  It is worth the
frustration and extra effort even if you intend to strip later to avoid
scratches and scrapes in the metal.

&gt;much less toxic than lacquer thinners etc.. just about as effective thogh


However for those more inclined for cheap removal, kerosene is cheap, works
sufficiently, and actually what drips isn't all that environmentally evil as
them little microbes eat it.  Gasoline is of course a superior solvent but
dangerous and is not eaten.  Nitrile gloves are smart when using either.
