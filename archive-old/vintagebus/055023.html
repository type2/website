 Or you can do like I did to the Pritschenwagen....go to WAL-MART, buy the camouflage spray paint specifically for hunting vehicles (Krylon, me thinks) and have at it.  While you are there dont forget to pick up the obligatory gun rack, a CB radio and some chaw.   Hehehe

Sherwin Williams makes many common brands - like Krylon.

They have an online store.



Did you know you can buy PPG paint online as well?

&gt; I am about to go pick up some acrylic primer from Sherwin Williams, but
&gt; since this is not gonna be cheap, I would really appreciate any: &quot;Hey 
&gt; don't
&gt; use that stuff&quot;, and any reasons. I haven't seen any PPG dealers in the
&gt; area, and this would be my first choice. The price is somewhere around
&gt; $188.00 for a gallon of this stuff. This price includes 
&gt; hardener/reducer.
