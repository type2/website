Subject: Re: [VB] Steering box

&gt; I would like to figure this one out too. IF someone new what the parts to
&gt; get I would buy a set. I have a spare steering box that I would like to
&gt; rebuild and two hundred dollars is a bit much.

I looked in Bentley and it looks like the only items that wear out are the
lever shaft bushings and the steering column worm gear.

The bushings could be made up at any machine shop but, I don't know where
one would find a new steering column. Probably would have to get a good used
one.
