 is having all tire inflated and no brake is seized!! &gt;&gt;
Hi Michel,
Should work as long as you take it slowly downhill.  Otherwise the splity 
behind you will tend to push the bay rear end to one side or the other when 
braking!  Best to take your own wheels to tow it on.  Repack and inspect the 
front bearings.  Change tranny oil and test the RGB axles for bearing 
wiggle/wear and a good idea to install magnetic plugs in the RGBs.   Eric&amp;Barb
PS A friend of our's just recently sold a 59 DD panel of very low milage.  He 
told the new owner that it needed to be trailered or needed new tires since 
it had the original cracked tires from the hannover factory!  The new owner 
agreed, but he towed it away on a tow dolly when our friend was not there to 
see it off.  Result: one very nice all original rust free bus flipped over 
three times when one of the rear tires blew......    EEE&amp;B
