&gt; The subject says it all.  '68-'69 model year, bus  front beam.  New
&gt; brakes installed.  Sold drum to drum.  Has wide 5 drums on it.  Torsion
&gt; arms can be adapted to fit later model disc brakes.  This is a bolt up
&gt; without modifications to a '67 and older bus.
&gt; 
&gt; I am located in Long Beach CA (SoCal) area.  I can bring it down to the
&gt; OCTO meet if you decide to buy it.
&gt; 
&gt; $125 OBO.
