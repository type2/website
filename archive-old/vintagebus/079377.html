Subject: Re: [VB] 6V/12V starters

Hi Matt,
We have never heard of a 12 volt starter with 6 volt gear except one Eric put 
together.  We would just use (and do!) a 6 volt starter on a 12 volt system.  
With this setup one does not have cold start up problems if the electrical 
system is maintained and we even have had to use the starter to walk the bus 
uphill in first gear out of a busy street when the engine just died.
  Which axle cap are you looking for?  The 1955-63 or 1964-67?
Eric&amp;Barb
