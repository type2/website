Subject: Re: [VB] stuck drum update

I took a '66 bug rim (the one with all of the slots around it), and bolted
(with big washers on both sides of the slots) 3 pieces of chain to a 3 arm
puller.  I unbolted the arms, and bolted on the chain.  I then took my
impact to the 3 arm puller, and POP.  It came off.  I would not suggest the
impact unless it was the last resort.  Nice and slow, and nothing should fly
around the shop putting out an eye.

Later

&gt; hi, thanks for all the suggestions. It's not a running bus so I guess I
&gt; can't try driving with the nut backed off. I called sears, auto zone, and
&gt; harbor freight and they all claimed not to have any drum pullers. At one
&gt; auto zone the guy suggested taking the bus to a place that does free
&gt; brake checks and let them wrestle with it, hehehe : )  I saw a brake drum
&gt; puller with 3 arms on the eastwood website, it looks o.k. and cost about
&gt; $45. If nothing else turns up I might try that. I am not sure if it's
&gt; heavy duty enough or not though. For the last week or so I've sprayed PB
&gt; blaster on it and tapped it with a hammer so hopefully that's helping.
&gt; thanks again for all the advice! Chris
