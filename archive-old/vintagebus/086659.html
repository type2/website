&gt;&gt;  Are there 1.2 W 12 V bulbs?  When I took mine apart  it had 2 W 12 V 
bulbs and the gels all had holes melted in them.  That  extra 0.8 W must make a 
difference.  &lt;&lt;



Hi Tristan,
That is why we suggested the LED bulbs.  Plus they not only produce  1/10 the 
heat of normal bulbs, but use much less wattage, and last much, much  longer.
