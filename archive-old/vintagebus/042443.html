Subject: 61 transaxle throwout shaft
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.10.10003201218100.20304-100000_at_users.anet-stl_dot_com&gt;

hi all,

My 61 transaxle has that throwout shaft with the bolt instead of the
splines through it... the arm that attaches to the clutch is bent instead
of straight.

The PO put it together so that the throwout bearing isnt centered, using
some big mondo washer all ground down etc... so i want to fix it (of
course)

Now, i wanted to get one of those welded arms that dune buggy guys are so
fond of, but found out i cant get em for my style of arm... just the
splined kind... (unless anyone knows different?)  I could weld up my arm
and get a rebuild kit i suppose... but i'd like to have a spare too...

So, if i decide to update, what all is involved... i would assume i would
have to change or bend the bracket that the bowden tube goes into as the
clutch lever would be straight instead of bent and in a different place
left to right orientation.  Would i then need to specify a different year
of clutch cable???

I like the style thats in there, but i need to do something.  Any
suggestions? (the archive search turned up not much..)

thanks,

Steve
