Hey gang,

I want to install a tach in my '67 to give me something else besides the
radio and cell phone to distract me from the road;-)  I just wanted to find
out what the concensus is on getting the wires from the front to the back.
It's a walk through if it makes any difference.  Also, where do most folks
mount them?  The tach is left over from my hot rod daze, a 5&quot; Mallory with
shift light and rev limiter.  Excellent for those 10,000rpm clutch drops on
the 1600 sp:o)...just kidding.
