$20 each for 5 rims seems kinda high to me, unless
they are perfect.  When I was looking, I was finding
the $20-25 range.  I found a guy at a local swap meet
that was willing to sell me 5 of them for $60.  I gave
him $75, and he pulled out a bunch of other stuff and
told me that he liked dealing with honest people, and
promptly rewarded me with another $100 in NOS parts
for my 66 Crew cab.  I am looking for a place now that
will check &quot;trueness&quot; for $5 each and will straighten
for $20.  Then over to the blaster who will blast,
zinc primer and powder coat for another $25 a rim.  So
instead of paying $85 per rim for the new chromies,
I'm paying $62 (on the high side) per rim for original
(stamped 2/66) rims that should have a fairly touch
coating.  Plus for the $15 extra I gave him, he gave
me $100 worth of parts that I can use on my Crew cab.
