&lt;&lt;&lt;OK, I was changing the shocks this afternoon and on the left front shock
,  the bushing froze to the mount.  Got the shock off but the bushing is
still there and I cant get it off....&gt;&gt;&gt;

Dude! I just did this....where ya been? I used a dremel tool to cut it length 
wise and drill a few holes into it, careful not too deep or you'll hit the 
spindle. Then lube the hell out of it (liquid wrench) then twist it off.
