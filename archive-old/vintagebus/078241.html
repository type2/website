Subject: Re: [VB] Insulation?

Put the peanuts into small plastic bags like they give you when they ask
paper or plastic. Close'em with ties.

Then wedge those in the spaces.

&gt; OK, I know that I need to stay away from anything that can absorb water because it will eventually get in contact with some water and absorb it, hold it, and then cause rusting problems. It sounds like that using a spray on foam will cause water to become trapped between the foam and the metal and just sit there and that moisture will begin to assist in the oxidation of the metal. So, what about those loose styrofaom peanuts just dumped loosely into the door cavity (for now I only want to talk about the cab doors) and plastic used so that these styrofoam peices do not fall through the openings. I would really be careful to get the peanuts to fill all the nooks and crannys in the door so that they could provide the desired affect of insulating and sound deadening. Does This Sound Like A Workable Solution?
&gt;
&gt; Another way for me to ask this question is:  What is the best method of insulating behind the door panels in an early VW Bus that will provide a worthwhile level of insulation without creating some other problems?
