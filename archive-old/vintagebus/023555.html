Gotta laugh when I see this FART on Bus Depot
As one who has spent too much time in retail, yes same kind only I did
motorcycles and boats, the only time people are happy is when things are
cheap and fast. Hmm if I remember stats, these two are mutually exclusive!
Enter the X-marts,big,cheap and sell by the zillions. Only problem volks is
there ain't zillions of us out there. How many of you have noticed how few
independent anything there is anymore? And if you did, did you think how sad
as you headed to Wally Mart to save a few cents.From a group who as a
collective tell the rest of the world to slow down, maybe we should take our
own advice! This said, I own no stock in Ron, in fact, I have never bought
&gt;from him, etc, ymmv,yadda,yadda. Okay, rant over, flame suit on.
