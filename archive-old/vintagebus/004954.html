New Mexican case, hmmmm. maybe there is an oil galery that is almost
closed up? Causing minimal flow to the oil cooler?

engine


&gt; Last Friday a couple of us in the Tacoma/Puyallup area got called by
the
&gt; owner of a Westy whose engine had crapped out big time on I-5 near
Federal
&gt; Way, Washington.  He's traveling the West from his base in New
Orleans, and
&gt; got our names from the AIRS site.
&gt;
&gt; We got him towed to Oval's Motorsports, a large and well-reputed
aircooled
&gt; VW shop in Federal Way, and he camped in their lot 'til they opened
Saturday
&gt; AM.
&gt;
&gt; Earlier this week they determined that his &quot;recently rebuilt&quot; 1600DP
engine
&gt; [according to the PO from whom he bought the rig 3 months ago] had a
rod
&gt; gone and was such a pile of junk that it was beyond salvaging.  A
long block
&gt; was built up for him and installed in the '71 Westy.  After all was
&gt; adjusted, sorted out, and tuned up he was sent out on I-5 for a test
run,
&gt; and within 10 miles the engine had heated so severely that it fried
the
&gt; shop's 250 degree &quot;warranty seal&quot; on the new engine.   The timing
was
&gt; retarded a few degrees, the mixture was re-checked [Oval's is fully
equipped
&gt; to do mixture and emissions checks, etc.] and he was sent out again.
Same
&gt; result.
&gt;
&gt; This is a dead stock 1600DP, with a nearly new Mexican or Brazilian
&gt; carburetor.  The 009 that was on the engine has now been replaced,
although
&gt; I don't have info. on the new dizzy.  The brake booster has been
replaced
&gt; and replumbed, as it was shot and leaking vacuum.  Based on what Dan
has
&gt; related to me by phone, it sounds like a straightforward, basic,
&gt; uncomplicated 1600DP engine replacement.  The new engine has been
built up
&gt; and installed by a highly competent and experienced crew at a
reputable
&gt; shop, but they're apparently stumped on what is causing the
overheating.
&gt;
&gt; When I looked things over last Friday evening the engine room was a
&gt; disaster, with big gaps in the tin and strange wiring hanging
loosely
&gt; everywhere.  No way would I have headed across country with things
in that
&gt; condition.  Despite all this disarray Dan reported no heating
problems in
&gt; his westward journey.  Presumably all that has been set right in the
&gt; rebuild/repair process [the bill now exceeds $2000.00].
&gt;
&gt; The owner of this bus, Daniel Winkert, has now been stuck for a full
week.
&gt; He's obviously anxious to return to his home in New Orleans,
preferably at
&gt; the wheel of his bus.  If anyone out there has some ideas or
insights we
&gt; [and the Oval's crew] have somehow overlooked please respond ASAP.
Dan has
&gt; no e-mail or 'net access, so I'm the contact person.  He can be
reached
&gt; directly by cell phone at: (504) 296-6652.  Ironically, many of the
List
&gt; experts are in the Seattle area for this weekend's Vintage Classic
events,
&gt; and have driven unaware within a few hundred yards of where Dan and
his sick
&gt; bus are located.
