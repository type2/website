Yeah Isaiah - I would guess that you have a combination burnt pressure plate
and shot clutch.  How long have you driven it without adjusting it?  I'm
sure you know that by just &quot;barely&quot; disengaging the clutch, has caused undue
wear on it.  My guess is that when you take it apart, you'll either find a
paper thin clutch or a skeleton of one.  I've seen worn clutches before - or
rather - what was left of one.  While you are ordering your new clutch and
pressure plate, add a clutch cable to your list of items to get.  I'm sure
you'll be glad you did...

One more thing - when you mention you didn't have any power in 4th gear -
was the engine bogging or revving?  Bogging would NOT be an indication of
worn clutch whereas revving would be.  I've driven a dodge pickup with a
clutch so badly worn, flooring it caused a slight amount of acceleration and
then 3 seconds later this putrid smell filled the cab, the engine revved up,
and smoke was everywhere.  Yep - bad clutch - burnt to hell.  A good clutch
won't slip at all.
