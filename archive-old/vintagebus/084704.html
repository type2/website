Subject: Re: [T2] Bluetooth in a bus?

I use a logitech bluetooth ear piece with my Treo 650 and it works  
really well as it sits snugly in your ear hole and has a covering on  
the mic that seems to work well both at canceling out wind noise but  
also keeping my voice clear even when I am winding up the bus. The  
headset I have is the &quot;Logitech Mobile Traveller Bluetooth Headset&quot;  
you can find it all over, Staples etc, for around 50 bucks.

I have own a few bluetooth headsets and I like the Logitech quite a bit.

There are a bunch of aftermarket bluetooth head units (stereos) but  
it seems to still be a &quot;new&quot; market outside of the newer VW and Audi  
offerings, http://www.halfbakery_dot_com/idea/Bluetooth_20Car_20Stereo I  
would like one in my bus though at some point !

Steve

&gt; The corded ear buds are ok, but tend to get in my way, so I have  
&gt; recently considered getting a bluetooth device.
