Subject: overhead guages

Keep in mind that I am 6'2&quot; tall, but I can easily glance at the guages in
the overhead using just peripheral vision. I have had them under the dash
and that is way harder to read. Remember that as soon as you know where the
normal operating positions on a guage, it is quite easy to scan for changes
without actually &quot;reading numbers&quot;. To really make this position ideal you
could put an angled collar under each guage to face towards the driver. I
like the idea of the ash tray placement for visibility but I don't think I
would like the look. Maybe with some of the smaller guages that are
available.
Good luck deciding,
