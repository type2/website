Hi Nate,

I have 34 ICTs and they have the balance tube between them. I'm not sure
what they would run like without the tube, since I haven't tried that.
The problem you describe sounds like a &quot;too lean&quot; condition. I'm using
my 34 ICTs on a 1600 DP with a stock cam. My jet sizes are 140 main and
170 air correction. You probably need to try bigger main jets, if you
don't find any leaks like Dave suggested.

&gt; Hi Everyone,
&gt; 
&gt;     I've been having some tuning problems with my Weber ICTs that I just
&gt; haven't been able to figure out.
&gt; 
&gt;     I bought the set in good used condition.  I disassembled and completely
&gt; cleaned them inside &amp; out.  Everything as far as I can tell, is in good
&gt; order.  Here's the problem I'm having:
&gt; 
&gt;     It idles fine.  When warmed up, it revs from idle fine.  BUT, . . . If
&gt; I'm just cruising down the road at a constant speed, it coughs and seems to
&gt; loose some power (not much, just a little so that I notice it).  If I stab
&gt; at the gas, it accelerates fine.  It does the same thing when in neutral.
&gt; Off idle it sputters and even sometimes gets a backfire out the carbs
&gt; (usually the right carb) if the throttle is held in a constant off idle
&gt; position.
&gt; 
&gt;     I've sync'd them with a uni-sync gauge and they are dead on.  I've
&gt; checked/adjusted the linkage to ensure that the butterflies begin to open at
&gt; the same time and also hit the full throttle stops at the same time.
&gt; 
&gt;     Could this be jetting??  When looking through the archives, I noticed
&gt; that most folks mentioned having a balance tube connecting the two
&gt; manifolds.  I don't have one of these currently.  Could the absence of a
&gt; balance tube be my problem??  If these were my old 40mm Dellortos, I would
&gt; say I had a blocked progression port, but these don't have these and I
&gt; cleaned everything religiously before I installed them.
