A lot of my suppliers and some of the VW parts vendors go to Brazil to see
what is happening at VW Brazil and at other VW part manufacturers. I have
been trying for over 2 years to get one of my suppliers to import the Disc
Brake, King and Link pin front ends, with no success, if I was to purchase a
quantity (100) plus front ends they would try to get them up here for me,
which comes to the money aspect, does someone out there want to loan me
$100,000 dollars to pay for these?, is there that big of demand that I could
sell 100 of these, would you pay $1200.00 for a brand new disc brake front
end? Anyway the same goes for the tilts all it takes is some major cash
outlay. WCM did import some of the Brazilian tilts many years ago, they have
them on their single cab with the trailer.

People do it all the time.
I don't believe they are STILL making pressed bumpers.
They dropped pressed bumpers in the early 70ies.
Even in brazil they are not easy to come by.

&lt;&lt; Isn't there ANYONE in the US that can get brazil stuff. Seems like 
those pressed bumpers would be a big seller. Not to mention the ball 
joint front end, ect.
