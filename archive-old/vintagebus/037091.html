&lt;&lt;  I will lose no sleep finishing this one up. I'll just sell at
 a later sate to buy what I want. Finally bought paint for it now, and I know
 it isn't original, bit I went with a 2-tone cloud white and candy apple red!
 Can't wait until I actually get to spray it! Thanks again! &gt;&gt;


You might want to paint it a color that someone else will like, if your gonna 
end up selling it. Go with the stock color.
