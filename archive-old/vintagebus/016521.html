Wait a minute! JP reveals the lurking identity of
someone who, within the covers of highly respected
publications, has continuously ranted and lambasted
the evils of the anything that has a keyboard, the
internet in general, ebay, distributors which dont use
points, engines with hydraulic lifters, and the
apparent current looseness of the term &quot;restoration&quot;.
Jon Furst &lt;if it doesnt have German air in the tires
then its not a resto&gt; has an freekin EMAIL ACCOUNT!
Well Holy Savior strike my lily white butt dead!
hahahahaha. What is this world coming to... Next thing
you know grown hetrosexual men will be wearing earings
and Momandem Rebels will stop flying the flag in
Dixie!

JP must have been thinking: TIARFOMB =
Time I Announce A Rare Furst Of Microsoft Business
