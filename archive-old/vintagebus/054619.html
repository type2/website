Subject: RE: [VB] more shifter linkage questions

If I'm thinking right, the rear (long straight) shift rods are the same for
the most busses... the forward rod and coupler changed.

And yes, if you have a front shift rod from a 58, it is excellent trading
material.  I looked for about 9 months before I found one from which I was
able to fix my original.... now I have a spare just in case :-) ... NEVER
throw stuff like that out, it can always be fixed.
