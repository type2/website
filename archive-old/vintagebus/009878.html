Subject: The &quot; cop-out&quot; thank you letter.

Hey all.  I just wanted to profusely thank all of you who repeatedly send me
emails with encouragement and advice regarding this engine overhaul.  The
guys at work and my friends are astounded when I tell them it's my first
time doing a VW engine rebuild.  I guess my air of confidence and
accelerated experience due to what I've learned from all of you has been the
biggest factor.  I'm kind of getting in the swing of working on the bus
again.  I'm still not as fired up as I initially was but I think the flame
will burn brighter once I actually drive her around the block with a parade
of cops behind me! :-)

I wanted to thank the following listees for their help instead of emailing
each one.  I'm doing this in the interest of time (I've got to keep working
on that engine) and in appreciation for all the help.  In no particular
order I've got James Lindsay, Don Boneau, Russ Maak, Bill May, Ronnie in
Havasu, Glen Hadley, ZUNDFOLGE Jim, Dave Martin, Eric&amp;Bard (the bus-clock
people), George Lyle, Jeff Martin, Steve Howell, Craig K, Thom Fitzpatrick,
Randy Gregory, Jason Black, Jamie Rivers, Frank and Cheryl Musil, Terry
Wolfe, Zac Robbins, Rob Laffoon and Justin, Cindy, Ric Campbell, and I'm
sure there are more.  If I've left you out, let me know so I can give you
credit.  I know there are more but these people seem to repeatedly and
patiently email me all the time.  I know this takes a lot of time to do
this.  Thanks again!

Erin
