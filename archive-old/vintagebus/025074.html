&gt; Anyone ever seen, or have pictures of a VW bus done &quot;WOODY&quot; style?

I've sort of thought about doing this with the '67 that I crashed.
Could it be as easy as gringing off the welds on the old dented panels,
and fixing some marine ply or something to the framework below the

The perfect job for someone who has a bus that's body is scrap quality

Oh yeah, have seen this done to a b_at__at_tle
