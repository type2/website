 &lt;&lt; Hi everyone! I just picked up a pretty basic, complete and original red 
62 
  Kombi for 400 bucks and plan on restoring it and had some questions. The 
 body 
  is pretty decent, no bondo or freaky hippy craftsmanship hackjobs. I 
noticed 
  some pretty serious rust on the lower cargo doors both inside and out. 
Which 
  other year doors are compatible with my Bus? I know where I can get a pair 
 of 
  67 doors but they dont look like the exact same as mine.&gt;&gt;
 Hi Alan,
 What is your chassi number?  Never totally believe the paperwork for the 
 model year of your VW.  If is is from 1961- very early 1963 model production 
 it should be between chassi number 705 620 up to 1 019 924 for the correct 
 doors.
   -  - -- - - -  - - -
if your upper door hinges are just above the belt line (on a 62 they should 
be) and the cab/front doors a=have pull handles then your can use any low 
hinge (just above the belt line ) cargo doors.    However, the front cargo 
door was changed when they switch to the push button front door handle in Dec 
63, so then they added an indent in the forward cargo door.   so though these 
later ones will fit, you noticed they look different, so you would want them 
off a low hinged pull handle cab door bus.  
 
 &lt;&lt;It also needs brakes all around, I noticed some of the prices for these 
 parts are pretty high. Is it possible to use 64-70 cylinders and shoes 
 without alot of modification or destroying the backing plates at all? I want 
 to restore this wonderful Bus so that I can drive it  next year and get rid 
 of my New Beetle (bleh) and get back to my vintage Vws.&gt;&gt;

 If you really plan to daily drive this bus and since you are just starting 
 out in this area it would be best to install 1964-67 suspension in it 
 instead.  The RGBs are a little higher geared, and the brakes are 20% bigger 
 which make them feel more like 50%!  Also check out the freeway flier tranny 
 info in the archives.  It really has helped us get great MPG, engine 
 longevity, and the ability to keep up with 60+MPH freeway traffic.  Also 
 check out the dual circuit master cylinder conversion we have in the type2 
 library.  Which will double your chances of being able to stop if some part 
 of the brakes fail!
-  - -- - - - 
ya, except that is a lot of work, and I wouldn't want to start off with that. 
  The rear cylinders are available cheaper brazilian, as they are used for 
the later buses as a well, though the front are only avalable German and cost 
more.   Get new brake hoses as well, they are often overlooked in brake jobs 
and can collapse inside while looking fine on the outside, or can get bulges 
when they are about to burst.
  
but yup, you cannot just bolt the later bigger brakes onto the 55- 63 
suspension.

 &lt;&lt;Lastly, can anyone recommend a good manual for restoring a Split Bus? Is 
 there one that gives details of body construction and bodywork?&gt;&gt;
 Best is the Bentley reprint of the original shop manual.  Pricey due to huge 
 info stored in there!   Eric&amp;Barb

yes, definately get it.
