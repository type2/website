Make sure you have the right one, for the right side....................the
right and left are not interchangable

ie..  drivers side side i believe is reverse thread, passenger side is
normal thread

Subject: [T2] 1967 Front Bearing Nut


&gt; I've heard from various sources that the late model hex nut for keeping a
&gt; front bearing in place, should work for my '67.
&gt;
&gt; I tried this over the weekend and found that the nut from my '71 didn't
&gt; want to screw onto my front spindle with only fingers used for the
&gt; tightening.  I don't want to force it and strip my spindle, but I'm in a
&gt; bit of a bind and kinda need something RIGHT NOW.
&gt;
&gt; (A very kind Mark Dearing has sent one to me but it hasn't quite arrived
&gt; yet, probably due to mail screening at my building).
