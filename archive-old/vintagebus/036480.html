&lt; i just lift the bus on my hoist and install the box
after i get it to the shop!

back from the sema show in vegas, wow!!!
the latest trend, jap drag cars (fwd) oh boy 

did find a lot of parts though, not at sema, but just rooting around
got a bunch of split doors, front, rear, and cargo, even a pair
of uncut panel (62 and up) doors. filled the double door up and
loaded the roof rack, not as fun as finding a whole bus (ask vw
howard, he bought the lowrider i mentioned, cool bus, i didn't need it)
plus i fit 4 buses worth of parts in my 1 bus, 
found an excellent stash of heater boxes, at least 100 of them 
and the ever elusive air flap (in the shroud) assemblies, so if any
body needs this stuff i will go pick it up and spread the wealth.
didn't have room this trip.


also found a 64 sundial camper f/s and a 60 single cab (could be for
sale)
and the ever harder to find 1960 15 window hardtop, will sell both
my 66 deluxe hardtops to get this one, just what i've been looking for
and is almost in my grasp.

as i mentioned before, i did locate 185/15 8 ply tires so if anybody is
interested please let me know as these need to be bought in volume in 
order for the supplier to import them and for me to get them.

also a lot of interesting things happening in the aftermarket parts
world, things will get very interesting in the near future,

pss. a while ago there was talk on r/b gears, i found a guy with 2 not 1
complete ALPINE gear r/b trannys, so does anyone know
 the gearing in these??? 


psss, crusied at 65-68 mph all the way there and back, approx 160
miles each way, no problemos, got 11000 miles on the new factory
vw long block since 6/30/99, according to my speedo~

Here is a different angle:  (old farm boy rigging)

Being a &quot;what if&quot; kind of guy and finding a number of busses with froze
wheels, rusted lug bolts, no front ends and missing trannies, I decided
to
design something that I could haul with me on a rescue mission that
would
be easy to set up and take down.  What I came up with was a portable
hoist
that goes over the bus that will lift any bus high enough that I can
back
my car trailer under it.  It takes me about 10 minutes to set up the
hoist,
or tear it down and the heaviest peice is about 30 pounds.  It uses 2 -
2000 lb boat winches for the lifting power.  It was built using 2 inch
square tubing, 1 1/4&quot; round tubing and 1&quot; round tubing for the truss
bridging.

As to date, I must have used this thing over 20 times with no problem. 
One
person can set it up, it does NO DAMAGE to the bus and it always draws a
crowd (bet you never say a bus fly!!)  And I spend no time down in the
dirt
tring to bolt  something to the bus.  Also, here in Kansas it is against
the law to have even 2 wheels on the ground from any vehicle that does
not
have current registration.


&gt;&gt;The fun part will be taking my own front end there and installing it.
&gt;
&gt;This is one thing I'm gonna work on when I get time. Since most of the
time
&gt;you find the rear-end (transaxle) missing of the 2, I fashioned a
&quot;rear-end
&gt;dolly&quot; out of scrap that bolts to the tranny mounts. Man has that thing
&gt;come in handy! I swear I could sell a few of those if I had time to
make
&gt;'em! Think how many times you find a bus without the rear-end. OR how
many
&gt;times you've got it out to work on it and suddenly need to move your
bus.
&gt;
&gt;You can see pictures of it here:

&gt;
&gt;Anyone done anything like this for the front end? I've got a bus I
need to
&gt;haul off that I just might end up using is as an excuse to make
something
&gt;up.
