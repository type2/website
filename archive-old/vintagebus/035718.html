Subject: 59 truck wiring update
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

did I mention that my truck had some funky wiring and the turn signals did not
work?    

I pulled out my book w/ the colour diagram, turned carefully to the correc
page (us spec) and hooked up a light to look at the wiring unde rthe dash.
Pulled off the kick panel.   The  turn signal blinky cylinder was not there, I
had pulled out the 12V one and a bunch of non VW wires earlier.   SO I grabbed
my 6V blinkgeber  (that's german you know) and looked at the wiring diagram.
It was missing the wire to the fuse block to blinkgeber.  SO I found a black
wire with white stripe (to fit the wiring diagram to make it easy next time I
look at it) and screwed one end into the fuse block and plugged the other into
the blinkgeber + terminal.  Plugged the blue wire to the dash light into
another, and the red/black wire into the third.  As the bus was originally all
screw on terminals, which get through out, it seemed the wires off the turn
signal switch were all twisted together to the ones in the main wiring
harness.  I looked for the little connector with two screw bits to connect
them properly, but only found one  :(   

SO if anyone has a few extra, I would love to get some and get rid of the
electrical tape and do it right.


So, the turn signals are in the running lights in front (some one took off the
front turn signals) and worked on the left rear, but not the right rear.  Took
that taillight apart again, and decide to clean it up, as it was black inside.
It got black with cleaning.  So I painted it silver with a rattle can, after
blocking the bulb area off.   Reinstalled and it all worked well.  
Truck seems to have all the lights working now.  :)   I am so 'appee!!!! 

Decided to put a black horn button on, it had one with a white ring, which was
out of place.  I had to put one together out of pieces.  Carefully cleaned
wher e the metal dish touches the bash wher e the wire connects, cleaned up
the black center parts, installed the spring, fit it all together with the
chrome ring  and care fuly bent the tabs on the chrome ring to keep it
together.   Greased the screw and attached the wire.  Toot! Toot!

Now I need a dove blue ashtray, and a grey sunvisor.
