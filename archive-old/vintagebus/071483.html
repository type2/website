Subject: Re: [VB] Semaphores

They were standard on all VW's (american and european) until 1955, when both
got bullet turn signals.  On the european markets, however, they were used
up until 1961, then both got flashing signals.

&gt; Can anyone tell me a little more about semaphores?
&gt; What was the last year they were available in a bus or bug and were they
&gt; ever offered stateside?
&gt; Thanks in advance.
