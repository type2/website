You see...just a little thought and I like it a ton better. If the design
team in Simi Valley had actually looked at a vintage bus before sitting
down to start on this they might have come up with something like this.
When they worked on the NB they had access to a pimped out, fully restored
40s beetle. That's how they got the flavor of that. I guess, they probably
had access to a fully restored Astro van when they started this project.
I've seen people saying &quot;Yeah, it's a minivan, but VW will do it
different&quot;! Really? When? What I see and read about this doesn't make it
any different from the other mini-vans out there. Buy it if you want, but
if I wanted a commuter vehicle, I'd be looking at Honda or Toyota, not VW
these days.

Of course, living in So Cal...I drive my bus every day. Hey! It did rain
yesterday, so it's not all roses. :)
