Subject: Re: [VB] Shifting problems - an update

Paul,

Don't bother changing to 30W oil in the box - Clara apparently did that to
clean out that box. Changing the oil weight won't ease your problems,
it'll just make a lot of work and prolly a mess too. If the ball or the
rina at the lower end of the shifter is worn on its left and right edges,
your shifting will suffer. I had this problem and took the shifter to a good
welder, who added metal to the edges and ground them back down to match
the rest of the radius. It fixed the rotation problem.
