Subject: Americans going to Buses of the Corn

Hi,

It's time to start planning for this years Buses of the Corn trip the 
first week of August.

http://www.busesofthecorn_dot_com/

Last year we left Greensboro, NC on Tuesday and arrived at BOTC on 
Thursday and  crossed the border in a group of four buses from the US. 
I would like to at least double and perhaps triple that number this 
year! I encourage everyone but especially those folks in the 
mid-atlantic, Ohio Valley, and Northeast to attend this wonderful VW 
event.

BOTC is an event held in the same spirit as EveryBus which many of you 
may have attended in the past so  you kinda know what to expect. You 
will find the people who attend friendly and fun loving with a real 
passion for camping and VWs. BOTC also has quite a few fun events for 
the entire family to enjoy.

Last year, we met up at Lake Erie State Park in Brocton, NY and spent 
Wednesday night there. The campground is situated right on the shore of 
the lake and is really well maintained and offers full hookups. We 
departed and crossed the border on Thursday Morning. This year we may 
do the same but we are also considering making a tour stop in eastern 
PA so we may consider heading through upstate NY and crossing the 
Border at Gananoque/Thousand Islands.

The locals Greensboro area folk are meeting for Cinco De Mayo and will 
start some planning. If you are from the US and plan on attending BOTC 
I would love to hear form you. I may put up a web page for American 
going to BOTC as well as yahoo group to make communication simpler.
