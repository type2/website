Clara and list

It seems to be a common PO change. my  64 single cab (#1 204 409) built Nov
21 1963 also has the small nut boxes, axle nut covers wit the easy pry off
lip and 14 inch tires.

Bill Keating; OK

82 Vanagon Westi    Daily driver
72 Ghia                     Niece's college ride
64 Single Cab           In restoration

&gt; it was changed to big nut aug 63 ch 1 144 303, so sounds like at some time
&gt; your tranny went bad and some PO swapped one in from an earlier bus.
Your
&gt; front suspension has teh axle nut covers wit the easy pry off lip?   That
is
&gt; 64-67 style.   It is a lot of work to swithc the rear axle tubes/ RGBoxes
&gt; over, you know, though , but do find the later stylke and plan when your
&gt; tranny goes to swap over to the 64-67 RGBoxes is my advice.   With time,
you
&gt; can wait and find the cheap deal.
