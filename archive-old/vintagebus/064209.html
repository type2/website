Subject: Re: [VB] My pics are up - engine Q's

| B case- larger oil passages, but earlier alloy.    If it ain't broke don't
| fix it, but if the case is shot I'd get a later alloy case. - like the A

|

Yes, it is a B case and I'm not going to change it for now. Motor runs very nice.

|  I'd adjust the valves and change the oil regularly (even if it's only after
| 40miles if it's dirty already) until it stays clean.

and that's next on my list.

| I'd ditch the filter on top and put a oil bath on it(need triangle bracket or
| substitute) and also hook up the fresh air tubes, it does have heater boxes.

heater boxes are in so all I need is a hook-up for fresh air tubes....

|
| I'd also replac ethe fuel line, and make sure it doesn't lean on the preheat
| of teh intake.   The preheat gets hot, you know.
|

fuel line will need some work but I might keep the filter or just simply replace it with something
else... is there something wrong with these filters? anyone had any problems? I know Ronnie has been
working on this engine so I might want to see what he's got to say about it.


| Corner window buses are stylee  :)

very stylee..... I love mine!
