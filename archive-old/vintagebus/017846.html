subject: friday rant &amp; ramble

i'm writing this from 30,000 miles in the air.  i'm glad that i have the constitution of a goat cuz i don't know where they get this plane food.  while in the air i've been enjoying several issues of splitzine (the route 66 splits newsletter out of albuquerque, new mexico) and the arizona bus club newsletter.  i think the combination of plane food and excellent bus writing has stirred up my juices to the point that speak... err, write i must.

in both newsletters there were rants about driving one's bus daily or at least frequently.  i read on feeling almost unaffected cuz i own nothing but vintage volkswagens, however i confess i don't drive my single cab as much as my '67 beetle.  thinking along i was reminded of a comment that one of my soon to be ex-coworkers made - that i should buy a water beetle for the drive to my new job.

some of you may recall my post about vw activity in the tri-cities area of washington.  welp, i turned down that offer feeling pretty bad as i really clicked with those folks.  instead i've accepted an offer with stanford university's law school and start mid-october.  with the stanford bullet on my resume i can go near anywhere professionally.  another good thing about stanford is that i can stay local; i do not have to pack up my mounds of precious parts and household goods as well as ship partially together vws.  my garage, (warning: last friday garage remnant) containing a huge purple toolbox filled with snap-on and mac tools and a little mexican (i can hear him now, &quot;i'm not little, i'm height challenged&quot;), will also continue to be available to me.  in the end it was the garage that broke the deadlock between the two offers.  a kind of magic happens in that garage that i am fortunate to be a part of; that became too valuable for me to loose especially now when i have vws that are delicate and in states of becoming.

so it's to stanford that i go, an hour and half commute (in good traffic) cruising along in an air-cooled vw.  my answer to my soon to be ex-coworker was that i don't know how to drive new cars and that a water beetle, though a volkswagen is nothing like the original.  in my mind i continued on that air-conditioning and fuel injection are for pussies and airbags and collapsible steering wheels are for those who plan to crash.  i have full confidence that my vws will get me to my destination without major difficulties and both nonserious and serious breakdowns will either be in the driveway, in the work parking lot or in front of the repair shop.  all of the breakdowns of the last few years have given me reason to believe this fanciful thinking is true.  now i have to go out to the parking lot to figure out what minor thing plagues my sunroof beetle.

In a new car, you're just going somewhere;                                
in a Volkswagen you ARE somewhere. -Stormy Henderson's Dad
