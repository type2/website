Subject: Re: [T2] Muir engine sounds url?

Don,

I just gave Joe a call and he said that he abandoned the web site a while 
ago with the material not being picked up anywhere.  I did a search for the 
sounds using  MUIR and &quot;engine sounds&quot;   and the only hits were links to 
Joe's site.   So... It looks like they are gone, gone, gone.

Oh well,

Scott
