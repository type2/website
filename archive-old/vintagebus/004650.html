&gt;Can you say expensive for no reason?

expensive for no reason.


 Go with Type 4power and you will still completely embarass all but
&gt;the baddest Muscle Cars.  When I had my 66 doublecab
&gt;running with a modified Type 4 engine, I took all but
&gt;a very few Mustangs, Corvettes, some slower Porches

i'm lookin to take out those very few Mustangs , Corvettes,
some slower Porsches, and the faster ones too !!!
( it's p-o-r-s-c-h-e :) the only type 4 power i can recall
that impressed anybody is on track at Watkins Glen
in a very hyper tube frame 914. Sears Point seems to
attract them like flypaper also, my busses never seemed
to awesome anybody...try to get more than 100 h.p.
from a type 4 engine, you're already lookin at where the
911 engine started 35 years ago, and it's done with reliable
german engineering. and it's from the original source...

&gt;and other speedy cars.  Even those stoplight drags
&gt;were close enough that most of the time, the driver of
&gt;the other car would roll the window down at the next
&gt;stoplight and ask 'What did you feed those gerbils?'.

gerbils have pushrods, 911's don&quot;t .

&gt;If you must, remember that a 911 engine rotates
&gt;opposite a VW engine.

911 engines rotate clockwise north of the equator,
kinda like the water in your bathtub drain...

&gt; As for the 5 speed, why?

901 and 915 gearboxes have 5-speeds. i have 901
and 915 gearboxes. there are many optional gear sets available.
i have them. i'm not opposed to using a late bus irs trans,
i have those too, but the porsche trans come apart easier
and there are many more modifications available for those...

&gt;Better low end acceleration or higher top end speed?

both. easily done.

&gt;When I get my dc back on the road, I'll cruise over
&gt; and take you for a spin.

eat my dust... 8^)  we could try &quot;monkey run&quot; or
&quot;dead man's curve &quot;. yer choice...

 and so , back to the quest : the &quot;expensive &quot;
referred  to in the above relates to the addition of a quaife
differential , a $1600  modification in the porsche transaxle.
this could be substituted  for by a detroit&quot; true-trac&quot; torque-sensing
gear-driven variable speed unlimited non-slip differential. ($500),
available for the late bus irs trans...

in actual fact, the whole reason for these modifications,
other than true &quot;stylin' &quot;, is to make the 35-year old vehicle
competetive with freeway traffic, with some attention to
horsepower, suspension, and brakes... i have toyed with the
idea of converting the whole thing to vanagon syncro to
include the possibilities of all wheel drive, but so far that whole
system is so quirky in it's original configuration that to incorporate
under a splittie would be a monster problem.
