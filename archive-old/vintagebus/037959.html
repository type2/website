Subject: wheel bearings?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

 nuts for my 67 bus
Are the nut that hold the outer wheel bearing in on the front left wheel  
(you know the reverse thread pair with the locking thing) 
Do the ones from later models fit (68-later) because i can not find any 
splits at junkyards
in the sf bay area.  Can  somebody let me know of any where they have seen a 
split recently.
