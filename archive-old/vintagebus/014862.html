Subject: Panel Restoration - what to do?

Well, I'm to the point where I'm finishing the nose on the panel.
After this, there won't be a lot to do apart from the normal dings
and dents, which brings me to the question: how should I finish 
the bus?  I'm debating between plain dove blue or logo'd.

I've always thought it would be cool to restore a panel, because
you could paint it just about any way you wanted short of hipp-dippy.

I like yellow.  I thought of pimping it up with a big Bosch logo.

When buses were tarted up for commerical use, were the insides 
painted to match, or were they left the original color inside?
