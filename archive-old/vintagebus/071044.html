Subject: Subject: Price for an appraisal?

As a Board member of NADA   &quot;National Automobile Dealers Association&quot;  I
have been doing VW appraisals for way too many years--and NEVER charged
Anything !!    But I must see the VW  --- IN PERSON -- No Expectations !!~
To maintain the standard, and to be able to answer for you, to an insurance
company this is a must-- To date I have never lost !!
Phoenix AridZona---uj, TWWM

PS: The Rate of Charge by an accredited appraiser, can be anywhere from
50.00  to as much as 300.00
