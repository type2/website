Page 19 of the 11/99 Brill's Content magazine has an Absolut Vodka ad. Title is Absolut Jersey with a bottle shaped diner and a white/red 21/23 Deluxe parked at it. No overriders and no front emblem or trim. Wide license plate. The angle is from the top, it may be a double door with high hinges! Good magazine btw, find it at the library. 

Also, front cover of Bob Dylyan's Freewheel'in album from when? '65, '66? has a kombi on a NY street. 

Now that the temps are dipping into the high 40's at night here, we have some dew, so I'm putting the wipers on the vehicles. Needed to grease the pivots, which wouldn't come out, so found two sizes of beer lines from the brewery that would fit on the grease gun and onto the threaded part of the pivots. A clamp on the gun side and a finger clamp on the pivot side let me push a bit of grease to the inside. Wiped the extra onto the linkages. Did the same to the motor shaft. Is there an adapter that threads onto both ends to make this less messy? Take it to the next meet and grease everybody in a few minutes, keeps water out too. 

Absolutly no bus content: Being John Malkovich is the most bizzare and funny movie I've seen in a very long time.
