Subject: Re: [VB] Bottom tin opinions - Revisited

if VW didn't think there was a need for the 
engine to have tin below the cylinders, they sure as he!! wouldn't have put them 
there. think of the millions of $$ they would have saved over the years by not 
putting them there. who cares what they do?

i'd rather have a $2 piece of tin stopping rocks 
rather than a pushrod puking oil and not knowing it until it was too 
late.

i (personally) also think they help cooling by 
actually directing the air somewhere (away from the engine) rather than just 
having large, open spaces underneath for the air to go nowhere. if it were an 
issue of keeping the engine &quot;warm&quot; for the thermostat, they would have only put 
them on the one side, again saving $$. i mean, c'mon, every aircooled engine had 
the darn things, even industrial engines which don't see much rock throwing. 
they are obviously there for a reason!

geez, call me a vintage nazi, but it's 
ridiculous not to run them. why not just get a ceiling fan, wire it up for 12V, 
mount it above the engine, remove ALL cooling tin and cool it that way 
instead.

 


----- Original Message ----- 

Looking for opinions on the bottom tin...the pieces that attach to the 
case

and the heater boxes.  The local shop owners believe them to be 
gravel

guards to protect the push rod tubes from flying rocks.  Others 
think you

have to run EVERY piece of the tin in order for the complete system 
to

work.
