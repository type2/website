Hi David,
Hmm.  Sounds like you have the indicator light wired incorrectly to the 
flasher relay.  So now you have it so when the key is off the positive power 
is going from the relay thru the indicator light and grounding thru one of 
the other indicator lights.  Then when you have the key on the other lights 
and the flash indicator light have electricity to them stopping the indicator 
light from flashing.  The correct way of having it wired will result in a 
flash indicator light that will not flash with the key off while the 
E-blinkers are on.  Only when the key is turned on will the signal indicator 
light flash.  The wiring system was changed a bit for AUG62 and later so the 
E-flashers could function with both the engine and ignition key off.  If this 
was not done this way the key would have to be left on and the distributor 
points would burn out if they happen to be closed for more than a couple of 
minutes.   Eric&amp;Barb
