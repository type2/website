Lurker and sometime frantic contributor that I am, I guess I'll take the
opportunity this thread provides to say hello.  In matters of work, I'm one
of the lucky ones:  I am doing what I am most 'called' to do.  I manage a
6-acre organic farm (veggies, herbs, flowers) in Port Townsend, WA, plying
my wares among locals and migrant camera-toters alike.  Current projects
include solar/wind generation system, raising goats for pack animals,
heirloom tomato trials, and just general chicanery (not to mention '63
singlecab).  So if any of you bus-folk are travelling through stop by for
lunch and a bull session...
cheers
Trevor
