&gt;Subject: City on my butt!

That's *gotta* hurt...maybe you should wash more often?  :)

&gt;Well, it finally happened... the City of Stillwater (Oklahoma) is on
&gt;my ass about having my bus sitting in my driveway without an engine
&gt;and a tarp over it.

Are there any time limits in the statute?  Would it show &quot;reasonable 
progress&quot; to put the Bus in the garage for a night or two every week,
fortnight, or month?  I know you said your garage is full, but maybe
the Harley will fit in the Bus and they can both live in the garage.
Either that or it's time for sheds to sprout in your backyard...see
NQ's Web page http://home.ispi_dot_net/~elassley.bie/shed/shed.htm for
handy tips on shed placement.

As has been noted, somebody probably narc'd on you.  Usually they won't
tell you but you might ask the Man who it was - sometimes they can tell
you.  

What shape is the Bus in?  Is it engine-less and rolling, or engine-and-
tranny-less, or ???  It might pay to find a tired-but-running engine for
a hundred bucks, put it in the Bus, and move it around every so often.

Does the statute say anything about it only applying to private vehicles
or residential neighborhoods?  If not, I guarantee you that you can find
at *least* one vehicle in violation down at the City's own public safety
or public works yard.

Good luck!
