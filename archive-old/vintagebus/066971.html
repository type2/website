Subject: Re: [VB] Replacing front window rubber

Thomas,

Dont bother using the POR on the dash. Just sand it down to either the
factory primer, or to the metal, then hit it with a good sandable primer,
then a topcoat. If it's rusty then you need to sand it down to clear out
the rust. The POR would be too thick by the time you're done on the dash.
The POR is great when you have some depth of bodywork and the room to use
it. I've been doing some touchup work on the 67, and have been making
these same decisions for two weeks now. On exterior body work, if I have
to go down to bare metal to remove rust, I hit the metal with the Metal
Ready, then rinse, then a thin coat of POR, then the light coat of my
primer at the two hour point.

Sounds like you've got the procedure down. Good luck on it.
