Subject: Re: [VB] survey: testing cooling etc [VB] was side scoops 

Why not just buy a couple of electric fans from Jegs or something and attach them inside the engine
compartment over the louvers?  This would give you a engine compartment pressure that Clara could
write home about.

Yes, if the engine compartment seals are perfect, what we would look for
is a possible increase of engine compartment air pressure, with or
without, say scoops.  Do scoops help?  What's going on in there?  If we
could increase the perfect engine compartment's air pressure this would
help cooling and carburation, if the air was cool and fresh!  Gary Gibson
