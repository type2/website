Subject: inconsistent engine problems
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hi everyone,
I hope someone can come up with a solution to my engine problems. I really 
want to take my bus to Kelly Park on sunday and not drive the bug, much less 
have I to drive the bus to work everyday.
Engine is a 1600dp, 009, 34 pict-3
Problem is that there is a stuttering feeling coming out of the engine and I 
get almost no power during this moment. I've had the problem before and it 
always was a clogged fuel filter and when I changed it, that fixed the 
problem. 
This time I changed the filter and it didn't cure the stuttering. Strange 
thing is that it comes and goes.
Could it possibly be the choke bad fuel pump or ???
I have changed out the coil, condensor, points, plugs, fuel filter, and 
checked all seals, boots, and whatever else. Everything is in good mechanical 
shape.
Any suggestions would help and the problem comes and goes while I drive. Very 
annoying especially trying to drive up a hill with traffic backed up behind 
me.

Thanks in advance,
Dave Barnes
