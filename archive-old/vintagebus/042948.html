Here in Missouri you can transfer &quot;normal&quot; plates to another vehicle, but
you have to file some paperwork.  I don't think you can do this with  
historic plates.

I love Missouri's lax rules concerning licensing a vehicle as historic.
25+ years and 25 bucks and that rusty, inoperable hulk in my yard can be
there  legally.  :-)
