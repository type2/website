Subject: '56 parts compatibility with a '67

Hi,

A old man in my area is parting out a '56. Maybe a panel or kombi, don't know, I have not seen it.

Is there any parts form this '56 that could be of any use on my '67 deluxe? I am not interested in the 1200 engine and I'm pretty sure the transaxle wont fit either. But what about the rest? Cargo door latches, windows, door handles, body parts, suspension parts, redux boxes, bumpers, etc.

Thanks,
