Subject: Re: static timing light, make your own...

Here's another timing light idea that worked for me out in the boonies when
I didn't have my timing light with me, just a jumper wire.  Just attach the
jumper wire from the distributor to the tail light (unplug tail light).
Presto- one great timing light.  Don't forget to reconnect the tail light
wire.
