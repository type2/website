&lt;&lt; I went the same route as Paul, I have my bus for fun and a New Beetle for
 &quot;necessary transportation&quot;.
 And for a couple of different reasons. First of all, I think of my bus as a 
unique
 vehicle with a finite lifespan.
 I save it for weekends and the days I do drive it to work are &quot;special&quot;. 
People
 see it parked outside and usually mention it.
 The NB is nice, but it's &quot;just another production car&quot; and therefore if it 
breaks
 or gets trashed I can replace it pretty effortlessly. &gt;&gt;

        Well, hey, I'm not the only one!  Kudos for the post, I think that it 
works perfectly. :)
