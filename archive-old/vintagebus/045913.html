Subject: Bus Clip Art Needed
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I am in need of some black and white line type drawings that can be easily 
reproduced for the flier for Bulli Brigade and a T-Shirt design.  Scans of 
dealer brochures, etc would be nice.  Basically I just need stuff that can be 
copied clearly, so photos are pretty much out.  I would sincerely appreciate 
any help with this.

Thanks,

Kris Heinicka
