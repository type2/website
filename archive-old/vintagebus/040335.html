Subject:  Masking/painting sequence?

Greetings,

Getting very close to putting colour on the bus now
and I have a question 8-).....

Basically everything is primed and all doors are off
the bus (but have been fitted etc etc).  

Colour will be two-tone sealing wax red
with beige grey (I always was radical).  Bus will be painted in and out
with beige grey interior and upper and red below
the belt line...

I'm trying to think about the most efficient
sequence for painting, masking and fitting doors etc.
Looking at West Coast Restoration's site they seem to do the exterior
first completely in the upper colour, then the exterior below the
beltline, then the interior.  The doors seem to be done
completely while off the bus (with no belt line variation problems?).

hmmm..just about the opposite of how I'd thought I'd do it.  I thought
interior
first (beige/grey), then below the beltline exterior (red) and then the
upper
colour (beige/grey).  It seems intuitively easier paint below the belt line
first, then
mask below the belt line bulge and paint the upper colour second?  I can't
work out where doors come in the sequnce and whether to paint them off or
on the bus or some combination thereof (bit worried about belt line
variation
if they are done completetly off the bus)

Does anyone have the ideal sequence sorted?

Thanks

RobK
