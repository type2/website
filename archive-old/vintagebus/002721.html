&gt;Just browsing the net and ran across, quite accidentally a picture of a
&gt;jazzed up Bus.
&gt;
&gt;It's at
&gt;http://www.beadella_dot_com\beadbus.html

&gt;I'm familiar with this bus. It's the &quot;company vehicle&quot; for a bead shop
called &quot;Beadella&quot; located in San Mateo, Ca at 168 W. 25th Avenue. Beading is
another hobby of mine and although I live in Alabama, I stop by Beadella
when I'm in California on business. The owners (Mother and Son) are Volks
Folks with a great selection of beads and accessories. Highly recommended!
Stop by and chat if you're in the area. Tell them Bill from Alabama sent
you.
Bill
