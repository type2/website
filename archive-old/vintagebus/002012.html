Hi Everyone,

    I'm working the bugs out of a gas heater I have so I can install it in
my bus and was curious about CO detectors.  Are there any 12V or even
battery (AA, AAA, etc.) powered CO detectors out there that would be
suitable for use in my bus??  When I get this heater installed, I plan to
camp yearound in it so that would mean using it at night.  Granted, there
&quot;shouldn't&quot; be any problems with CO with the Ebersbacker unit by design, but
hey, waking up dead sucks and I'd like to be able to avoid that if possible.
Anyone ever heard of these and know where to get one??
