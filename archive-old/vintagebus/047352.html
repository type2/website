&lt;&lt;  This gives you registeration but no title for a period of I think a year. 
If no one claims the vehicle after that time they give you the clean title.

Hi Craig,
Actually they do give you a three year title.  So if you decide to sell it in 
this period you can legally.  If you keep it, and no legal previous owner 
shows it is all your after the three years are up.   Eric&amp;Barb
