Subject: Re: [VB] power converters

For heat, I use a Webasto AirTop 2000 gas-fired heater in my 66 Samba. The 
unit is about half the size of a loaf of bread (wheat or white!) and 
produces more heat than I an can use at a VERY low amp cost - even when 
first firing up.  I use it as a constant heat source when camping in the 
winter, and it keeps us quite comfortable all night.  You can get the 
specifics on the system at

http://www.webasto-thermo_dot_com/


I'll give you the basic specs below.  You need to order the gas model 
special, and be prepared for quite a hit to the pocket book.  Unit and 
installation kit run about $1500, but I think it is well worth the money for 
both safety (to see driving, heat when stranded, lots of failsafes in the 
unit) and comfort (real toasty!).

Good luck,

Richard

Casey,
How much of a strain?
WAY TOO MUCH.
The biggest VW alternator that I have seen provides 75 amps.
That is right around 1000 watts
1500 watts would require an alternator capable of providing in excess of
125 amps
With headlights, you are going to need 30-40 amps to just drive the
vehicle.
Add stereo and you're really pushing it.
You're up to at least a 200 watt alternator.

FYI  Watts = Amps x Volts
Also, for a long life out of electrical gear, it is best to keep their
sustained load at or below 80% of their rated value.  (In many places
that 80% figure is mandated by code).  Leave that extra 20% to handle the
load peaks.

You may notice that many devices are now being rated at XXX Continuous
and YYY peak
1. XXX is putting that 80% value in writing
2. YYY is peak and many times has a time limit associated with it.
I have seen equipment burnt to a crisp where it has been continuously run
just below peak (98%)

This is one of those seasonal topics that hit every year about this
time.  The colder winter we get, the more inquiries hit the list.
Electric heating has been beat to death and then some here on the list,
you might want to browse through the archives for more ideas.

Keep an eye on ebay for a gas heater.  I've heard them called Nuclear
Sausages and from my experience, they are well worth the name.

 &gt; hi all. you know those 12v to 110 power converters?
 &gt; well, here's my idea. i have a space heater at home
 &gt; that needs 1500 watts to run and it heats my 20 x 14
 &gt; room in about 20 minutes. my current power converter
 &gt; cannot not power this beast. so iwas thinking of
 &gt; getting a power converter that could put out 1500
 &gt; watts. now my question is, will that put too much
 &gt; strain on the battery/generator? would i have to go
 &gt; for an alternator at that point? and if so, what is
 &gt; the cutoff point for what a generator can handle
 &gt; safely? thanks for all your help.
