Hi Chris,

$100 US before shipping. I have no idea what it would cost to ship them to
the States but UPS and Fedex amongst other international freight outfits do
service South Africa. I would suggest that anyone wanting to import parts
from here use one of the international services rather than our Post Office
as they are not secure.

Later 

Michael
