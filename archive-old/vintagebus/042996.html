Wait a minute here!  If what you call the 'hub' is the outer surface of
the small end of the flywheel, that's where the lip of the front seal
rides on the flywheel. If this surface is not ultra-smooth and round,you
will instantly tear up your front seal, as well as leaking oil. The big
pair of pliers most likely tore up the surface I am referring to.
