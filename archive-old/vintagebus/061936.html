Subject: RE: [VB] Bus Hunt Report

You may see more in early October when East Meets West Indigibus Fest hits Birch Tree, Missouri.  We are camping on the 800+ acre Phoenix Ranch Oct 4-7, and many VW's from the East (and hopefully more from the West) will be attending.  Last year, I saw a big ole yard of VW's outside Birch Tree somewhere along the line... interested? P-mail me....
