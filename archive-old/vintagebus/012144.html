hopefully thte last update:

I ended up not having to drill out the screws that held the frame together, just needed to be patient enough to wait for the liquid wrench to work, and use a blessed screwdriver I got from a neighbor when I was growing up.

Got the new seals in, and the window is currently being held in by three screws, need to order a few new ones.
