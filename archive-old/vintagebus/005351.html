Yes everyone - when I make my big post about the trip to Dan's, it will
include the shifter polishing story.  I was able to buff 3 single bend
shifter extensions and 3 double bend extensions.  If you want one that _I_
did, just tell Dan and he'll ship it to you for $25 (no extra charge for MY
special touch.)  If you want it engraved with my official NQ scribble, I can
do that for you as well.  Hey Dan - I screwed them all together and they are
laying on the big foam pad on the chopped up barndoor single cab bed. :-)

NQ
