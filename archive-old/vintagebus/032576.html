Subject: RE: [VB] So-called &quot;IRS&quot; rear axle

yeah, even my bentley says &quot;the rear wheels are sprung independently on all
models..&quot;.  ever work in a parts store? try to explain this to joe public,
and he/she'll be more confused than if you'd have asked &quot;swin



&gt;
&gt; I beg to differ with many &quot;experts&quot; and with other folks who have been
&gt; dealing with, working on, and writing about VW's for a long time, BUT a
&gt; SWING AXLE is--and I repeat IS-- an Independant Rear Suspension, ie.
&gt; &quot;I.R.S.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; It is a misnomer at the least and downright misleading to VW neophytes to
&gt; call the later double jointed independant rear suspension &quot;IRS&quot;, as if
&gt; excluding the earlier design from this description.

&gt; INDEPENDANT 
&gt; Gene...an occaisionally vocal lurker
