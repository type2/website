Subject: Re: [VB] Radar Prototype Wheels?

I just ran across a set on that annoyingly addictive auction site. The price
seemed about right for new custom wheels. They do indeed look very sweet.

&gt; So Ronnie...any chance your gonna sell these wheels:

&gt;
&gt; I saw a picture of an original in a mag a few years back and thought
&gt; they were very cool. I'd love to have a set...but the price looks
&gt; like it's gonna be REAL high. They'd look SWEET on my '59 Euro
&gt; SC!!!!!!
&gt;
&gt; Anyone got any info on 'em?
