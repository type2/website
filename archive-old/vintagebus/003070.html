Nice to see your post Bob Hoover!

My job is at a lumber yard.  I deliver about anything to anywhere on an 8 x
16 flatbed truck with a tilt bed.  The most fun jobs are delivering 8 x 12
sheds by dumping them off the back without busting them up or flipping them
over.  The reaction I get from lookyloos makes it worth it.
