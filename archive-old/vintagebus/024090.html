What do you want to end up with?  A driver or a show bus?  Expect to
spend at least 10K on a nice restoration if you do it yourself.  So with
that in mind are you ready for the time and money commitment?  Do you
have the space, tools, resorses, friends?

If there is some rust in the rockers and on the floor you can safely
assume that there is much more than you can see.   Trust me, it happened
on my bus.  How are the belly pans?

I know these things are getting hard to find, but $3500 for a barely
functioning bus seems high to me.  My 65 Westy was in about that same
condition and I paid $500.00 for it.  Every day I look at it I think I
paid way tooooo much!  But then, mine is'nt a sexy Samba either.  

You're call.

Good luck !

Steve Harris
