Subject: Late tank swap...Dent the tank?

Good morning, fellow bussers...

Last night, I degreased and pressure washed my empty engine compartment,
and this morning I gave it a coat of white paint. Now I'm trying to
install the tank I got out of a '69, and I'm having a little trouble...

My first attempt to shoehorn the tank into place resulted in a cut
ground wire and a disconnected sender wire, so I pulled the tank back
out, replaced the wires and re-routed them to prevent it from happening
again. Shoved the tank back into place, and it doesn't want to sit down
on the shelf.

So, went to the type2 library, found nothing on late tank swaps. Went to
the archives, and found a 4 year old post from Thom to the old Vanagon
list. Thom's procedure involved banging a dent into the bottom of the
tank so it will fit. Not satisfied with that solution, I went to
Vintagebus_dot_com and looked at the procedure there. It said nothing about
having to bang a big dent into the bottom of the tank.

What gives? I don't want to bang a dent into my tank if I don't have
to... A quick response would be very much appreciated... I have to get
my bus back together today, so I can get to work in the morning!

david
