Damn - looks like VWoA is going for the juglar veins now.  RMMW does rate
farily high in my book - second to Ronnie's www.oldvolks_dot_com shop.  I just
don't know why VW has got to be such a PITA about things.  They should work
with the aftermarket community and not against it.  By VW refusing to supply
parts and obsoleting them, they've created the market where unlicensed,
fake, aftermarket merchandise is almost a necessity.  T-Shirts and so forth
I can understand but what about those cheap repop parts that I can't get in
original form because VW NLA'd them?
