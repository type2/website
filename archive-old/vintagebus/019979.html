A few folks have attempted to &quot;word me up&quot; regarding
warn w&lt;I&gt;nches as used in the off-road crowd.
I fully understood the nuances but as a leap toward
humor I dutifully transcribed the &quot;Jay Leno&quot; ad
verbatum imagining the potentials in someone *not*
appreciating the correct spelling of wOrn vs. Warn.

Correct spelling is not a common virtue on this list
so I thought that the mispelling of the word wInch in
the ad might go along with a possible misspelling of
wOrn.

It's called humor/humour... I &quot;aint&quot; thet stoopit.

Ironic twists and unexpected plays on words are common
devices used by professional and frustrated amateur
commedians.
