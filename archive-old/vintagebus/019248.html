Subject: the REAL Japanese problem
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

You guys don't even know the half of it.
You sell the bus to them for BIG bucks, and not even a
week after it gets over there, you hear air sirens
sounding, people clear the streets, and.....

GODZILLA rises out of the ocean, wreaking havoc on
Tokyo and the bus gets squashed flatter than a
pancake!

Don't even get me started about Mothra and those twin
girls.

&quot;Please give us back our egg...and our BinZ double
cab&quot;

Keep 'em here where the worst threat is Pomona night
banditos.
