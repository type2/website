&gt; Mostly new and $3500?!!
&gt;
&gt; Build it yourself with a NEW case (mag. or alum.) and COUNTERWEIGHTED
&gt; crank!  Don't cheep out on those two things.  Get a forged crank if you
&gt; are going to be revving over 5K. Have all moving parts balanced
&gt; dynamically too.
&gt;
&gt; If you don't feel confident enough to build one yourself, then buy a NEW
&gt; Mexican motor.  It'll be the best money you'll spend...and it won't cost
&gt; you $3500 either!  Just ask George...oh, but put good GERMAN 8 mm studs
&gt; in it...right George?

I don't know if my failure is any indication of a weakness in the Mexican
studs.  It might be simply a fluke.  I'm considering the
German stud replacement, but let's collect some data
before we cause a lot of folks to make a lot of replacements.  I have two
of these engines, one is a bug, one in a bus.  Several other listees also
have these engines and have had good luck with them.
