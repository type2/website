To whom it may concern... ;)
I discovered the cause of the type I tranny failure last night. Upon
pressing the gear stacks out of the case, I heard the tinkle of loose metal.
I thought that there would be all kinds of teeth missing from gears and so
on, but that was not the case.
    The culprit now unmasked is the 1-2 shift fork. A piece just over an
inch long had broken off of the top of the fork. It had settled in somewhere
where it repeatedly denied Erin access to 1st and reverse gears. Preliminary
road testing indicates that her new used tranny is good.
    ...that's OBC for all you people running the type I IRS conversions ;)
    In other news... the transmission case is almost identical to the one
from the '64 type II, perhaps even cast from the same mold. The only major
difference I have seen between the two is that the 1-2 shift rail is
*longer* in the beetle tranny. A bore to fit the rail was machined into the
case at the factory... extra support for the rail and/or long term shift
alignment issues may have been the cause of this. The type II 1-2 shift rail
is supported only by the bore in the intermediate housing.
    After some measuring (and hopefully, my approval), the beetle case will
be put to use as a shift fork adjustment jig.
    Lastly... I had fun this morning reuniting the '64s intermediate housing
with its shift rails and detent system. Again I am impressed with the design
of this and how it keeps the driver from accidentally engaging two gears at
once. They ought to put them on the tables down at the Cracker Barrel
restaurant instead of the triangles &amp; golf tees, IMHO :)

later...
