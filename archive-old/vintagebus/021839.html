Hi list,

This is directed mainly to Australian list members. I believe that Ozz bound
buses got a different engine cooling air inlet setup than those headed for
the US and Europe. 

South African Dcabs got air boxes that I wrote about a while back. They feed
air through channels riveted to the side gates and then through slots in the
bed into the top of the engine bay. My Dcab originally had this arrangement
in addition to the normal louvres and I assumed that all SA Dcabs were like
this untill I went to go and measure up the airboxes on a neighbour's '67
for fabbing my own. Somehow or other in the three years that I've been
around his bus I have never noticed that it doesn't have louvres at all! Of
the seven SA Dcabs I've seen this is the only one like it.

After that longwinded story the big Q. Is this the same setup as on
Australian Dcabs or is this a  one bus only oddity?
