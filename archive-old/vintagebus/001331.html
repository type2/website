Continuing my engine rebuild saga...

I checked the cam clearance (backlash) and the cam never lept out of it's
bore while rotating the crank forwards and backwards.  There is just a
little thunk of what I would say is about 2 to 4 thousands of an inch play
so I think this is acceptible.  After using the guru-approved Gaskasinch and
the silk thread on the case halves, I installed the cam plug and prepped the
case halves for assembly.

My teenage friend Shawn helped and within the 45 minutes we spent in the
shop, the case halves were mated, cam plug bolts torqued, and the 6 mains
torqued (I'll do the perimeter bolts tomorrow.)  Carefully double checking
during the tightening sequence revealed that the crank still spins just as
freely as it did prior to the mating.

The whole event was rather painless, uneventful, and smoother than anything
else I've done yet for this bus.  I was expecting dropped lifters, binding
crank, ruined bearings, etc. but none of that happened.  Must be some good
karma a comin'...

Thanks for reading...
