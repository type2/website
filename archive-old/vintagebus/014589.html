Hi, I'm hoping some one can give me some ideas here, I bought a 60' kombi 
today, over all a nice solid bus needing only a rocker, which was 
included.many layers of really bad paint. It's funny all PO's were to lazy to 
take the emblem off for paint(its gone now) so its got a nice original paint 
emblem stenceled on the front. I hope to get pics of this one and my 59' up 
soon. any way, to the problem, it shifts well and doesn't grind, but right 
after you let out the clutch it makes kind of a clunking sound in the rear 
end. you can almost feel it( or that part could be in my head) trany mounts 
arent new, but they seem solid. PO said some one told him it had something to 
do with the shocks or the splines on the axels. All brakes are new. My 
mechanical experience is limited to maintanance and very basic repair, so any 
advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you.
