&lt;&lt; You're talking about the dreaded nine-prong box, right?  :)  I've seen
 them at swap meets in unknown condition.  Some of the vendors sell
 a kit for $$ that is supposed to replace this relay.  A couple of days
 ago, I posted directions for how to wire it up with a &quot;generic&quot; turn
 signal flasher and a couple of jumper wires to at least get your
 brake lights and turn signals going.
  &gt;&gt;
The folks at springfield german make these flashers from a few standard 
flasher relays. not as pretty as some of the ones some vendors sell, but that 
reflected in the price. They can be reached at 541-741-1842. located in 
springfield OR.
