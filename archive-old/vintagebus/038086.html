 My rear right brakes on my 1970 have been jamming.  I know its a bay window 
 bus but the brakes seem to have more in common with the 60s models rather 
 than the later models and you guys are much more helpful.  
 
 The flat bar that goes between the brake pads is coming out of its slot and 
 jamming the pads open.  I already know that I need to replace the turning 
 stars on this wheel and would like to assume that this is happening because 
 the brakes are adjusted improperly.  Does this make sense?  Has anyone dealt 
 with this problem before?  The stars are on order and I will attempt to 
 adjust the brakes properly, but hope someone can tell me what more needs to 
 be done to keep this from occurring.  Any tips or helpful hints would be 
 greatly appreciated as I would prefer not to change brake pads every month!
  &gt;&gt;

why does the bar come out of the slot?  what is wrong with your adjustment 
stars, those usually are fine unless a tooth gets broken off from trying to 
turn them when they are rusted stuck.

yours brakes are wearing down too soon?   why?   how are your brake hoses and 
wheel cylinders?   bad brake hoses can cause brakes to stay on and wear down 
too soon.  Also if your brake pedal return spring is broken, it will wear 
down pads sooner  as they will wear unless you pull the pedal up with your 
foot.  Just replaced a brake pedal return spring on a 65 bus, fun fun fun, 
had to weld the stop back on as it broke off.

Also, don't you have springs in there holding it together.   Even when I take 
the shoes off the bus I have to pull hard to get the ebrake bar out, pull 
against the spring and mush the bar out.  Maybe you have a broken spring.
