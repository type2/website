Cabinet Refinishing 101.

Once again, when VW did something they did it right. 

I got all the cabinets pulled out of the Westy and into the garage for refinishing.  I spoke ad nauseum with a friend of Todd Swanstu's who is an antique furniture refinisher and has done numerous Westy interiors.  He gave me the step by step so I was ready to go.  Went down to the building supply store and got everything I needed.  Tip #1, however much sandpaper and steelwool you THINK you need, double it.  Same with paint thinner, although that one I was prepared for.

I won't go into the step by step drill, so if anyone wants to know pmail me and I'll give you the info.  I removed all of the cabinet doors and wrote down which one was for what (they have a key number pressed into the wood on the backside).  Let me just say that original VW/Westfalia laquer is thick, tough stuff.  Tip #2, do one cabinet at a time, and probably a good idea to do the doors separately.  Tackling one cabinet properly before the stripper dries is enough for one person.  Two full coats of paint/laquer remover came close to getting all of the old stuff off.  It still requires some spot treatment after the two caots.  Geez that sh*t is nasty!  Tip #3, wear long pants, a long sleeve shirt, heavy duty rubber gloves and socks if you're going to wear your old Birkenstoks like I did. 

I have one of the rear most double cabinets, the rear most seat base and the small sink cabinet stripped and ready for sanding.  The metal bands around the cabinet doors cleaned up very nicely also.  A wipe down with paint thinner helps to reveal if the color is going to be uniform when the polyurethane is applied.  I think the key on this for me is to take my time and get each cabinet perfectly prepped before Varathane.  The bottom line is there ain't gonna be any camping done before next Spring so why rush the interior.  It's the last link of the resto, but the first task due to available funds.

My *original* fabric search continues as well.  There's definitely cool vintage looking fabric out there, but no hits on a match for the original yet.  Still plenty of time.  My wife of course thinks the yellow/black plaid is gut wrenching, but she's come to grips that it's gonna be that way whether she likes it or not.  I've agreed to let her make up some cushion slip covers in a fabric she likes (passing my approval of course) that we can put over the cushions when we go on family camping trips.  I'm a saint!  I figure it will also help protect my seat covers as well.  :)

Updates to follow.  Any tips from others out there are graciously accepted.

Robert
