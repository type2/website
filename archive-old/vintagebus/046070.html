From your recently mentioned Binz page...
&lt;&lt;1959 models have a similar door but it is not &quot;suicide&quot;.&gt;&gt;

Is this true for right hand drive Binz DC's or did they make none?  The other 
day someone mentioned the RHD DC's had a suicide door, because they used the 
same door, or does anyone know?

Just curious.
