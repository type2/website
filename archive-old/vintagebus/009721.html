Okay I went ahead &amp; opened up the boxes. The snap rings were in there, but
not on the ends of the axles. One was broken &amp; I didn't find the small
pieces ( I hope they went out with the oil ) I replaced 4 of the bearings.
Makes me glad I looked into them. Thanks for the advice, John.
How much oil into each box to get it up to the axle housing? Then you fill
the trans to its proper level, drive it,  then check it after they have had
a chance to equalize, right?
My buddy says Castrol Hypoy 80-90 Whadda you think?

Ps
While the 'ol cab is sitting on blocks I'm getting the wheels &amp; bumper
painted, new door seals, guages, rubbing compound, polish &amp; wax all over.
Gonna be a sharp lookin' ride!!!!!!!!
