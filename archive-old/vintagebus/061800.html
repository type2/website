You could check with the Aircooled Shop Database at
www.aircooled2000_dot_com.  Be patient because it is down from time to time.

&gt;     Does anyone have a lead on a vw shop in the area?  I've checked out
&gt; several  body shops and &quot;supposed&quot; vw shops and they are confused as to what
&gt; a 57 singlecab even looks like. I've heard more than 1 time that vw did not
&gt; make them, but what do you expect from a cut and weld insurance is our best
&gt; customer shop!  I have everything ready to go for reassembly but just need
&gt; someone with the body skills to put the pieces in the &quot;correct&quot; places so I
&gt; can add the parts and get it on the road before winter.
