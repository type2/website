Has anyone seen the latest commercial for CDnow_dot_com?  I saw it on TV last 
night, there is a nice looking (from what I could pick up from the clips) 
splitty 11 window cruising around with &quot;The Magic Bus&quot; music going on in the 
background.  I was watching it from a distance, so I didn't catch much of 
what was being said, but it was cool to see the split!
