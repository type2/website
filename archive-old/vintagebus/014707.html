From what I was told, you have to do the sliders with the windows
in place, in order to get them right.  The guy who installed the
safaris in my '56 did just that - installed the windows, then played
with the location of the sliders a couple of times before clamping
and welding.  He ran the windows up and down a few times, coming up
with the location that provided the easiest operation for the
full length of travel.

&gt; I'm getting ready to mount some safari windows in my '59.  Can anybody tell
&gt; me at what location the weldons for the sliders need to be mounted?  Also,
&gt; any other tricks that one should know about would be nice...
