&gt;&gt;Just out of curiosity, since I am considering whether to paint my bumpers
of
have them plated....how much did it cost you?


My front bumper was reasonably straight, just a few holes here and there to
fix (I will run straight bumpers with no over riders).  The rear bumper had
two pea shooter muffler holes cut in it and a big dent where it looked like
someone tried to make room for a hitch.  In them selves, they were straight,
i.e. not twisted or buckled, just your normal amount of dents.

He charged me about 325 each.
