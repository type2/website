Does it do it when you rev it up but not at idle?
Mine did that and it turned out to be a crack that was not visible to the
eye. Once a certain RPM was achieved it would flex enuff that the crack
mattered and would let it hit the fan shroud or just make noises.

&gt;Ive got a nasty rattle. Its coming from the fan which seems to have a tad
&gt;of radial play although the nut is tight. Is my suspicion of a woodruff
&gt;key problem back there seem reasonable? Has anyone had this particular
&gt;problem? The gen seemingly has no play or noises in the bearings.
