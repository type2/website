Subject: Full Flow Filter Fitting Fquestion

Mike Gensler wonders:

------------------Mike:
Anyway, my question is...  I've had my case tapped for full flow.  But what
kind of fitting do I need to screw into the case that will clear the
behind-the-pulley sheetmetal?  Gotta be some kind of 90 degree thingy.
-------------------Me:
When I did mine (on a '71), I got the npt/barbed fittings from Bergs, along
with their h.d. oil pump and full flow cover.  They sell one that is not
only 90 degrees, but machined/rounded off to minimize clearance problem.
Still - be prepared to either dimple or cut a hole in the pulley tin.  In
my case, I ended up snipping a hole and then sealing up with red silicone.
I also use four feet of their red oil hose (at $4/foot or so) for a full
installation and get two to four years+ service life from the hose.

------------------Mike:
Also, I was thinking about hanging the filter mount from the support beam
on the underside of the bed (roof of engine compartment), but on urther
thinking, this sounds like a horrible idea.  If the hoses run UP to the
filter,  wouldn't all the oil run out of the lines everytime you turn off
your engine?  If so, obviously I need to hang the filter from under the bus
somewhere so the filter mount is no higher than the oil pump.  Does this
sound right
-----------------------Me:
I've run an original Oberg round filter on my '71 since 1980.  I've ended
up bolting it through the engine compartment floor just behind the drivers'
wheelwell.  It is actually set up to fit under the floor for summer and can
be bolted on top of the floor (in the engine compartment) for winter.  I
ended up cutting a slot in the sheet metal for the hoses to run through -
when not using the inside mounting I cover the hole with sheet metal.

 In this case, I run the hoses along the rear engine mount bearer and up to
the filter - dodging the hot air exiting below the 3-4 head.  I wrap and
wire tie the hoses in alumninum sheetmetal to give some protection from the
radiant extractor heat.  I have also used a similar full flow setup on my
'67 Type I urban baja since 1985.  In that case, I ran the hose up to a
Fram PH8, bolted through the drivers fender - just inside the rear
taillight assembly on the underside of the fender.  I am still running the
stock motor that came with the '61 pickup, but plan to follow the same
general scheme when it is rebuild time for it.

In both cases, the filter is higher than the oilpump.  Yes, the oil will
tend to drain somewhat - but less than you might think.  If one of the cars
has set for weeks at a time, I crank the starter until the stock oil
pressure light goes out before giving it gas to start it up.  Generally, I
just fire the motor up and watch the oil pressure light happily go out in a
second or less.  This is nothing compared to the lubrication needed by the
motor under load.

With well over 250,000 miles on this setup, between both cars, I have
convinced myself that there is no harm in having the filter above the pump
- and you can better install the filter out of harms' way.
