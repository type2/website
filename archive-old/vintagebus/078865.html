Subject: RE: [VB] wild radarwagen!

Yes, they did make radar busses from splitties.  I have a book that
shows a picture of one.... or at least that's what I remember....

The book I'm thinking about (all in german and I cant remember the
title) was being sold by Greg Banfill at vintage warehouse a bit ago.
It's a must have for seeing pictures of old weird busses
