Hi Steven,
Yes, you can as long as the generator has the regulator connected to it.

 Would like to do an initial start up of a recent 36er rebuild and run the 
fan...but don't want to unecessarily wire up those elec. components if I can 
get away with it. &gt;&gt;
You might want to consider rigging a simple one dash light bulb as a 
generator idiot light on the regulator to make sure the gen/reg are 
functioning at the same time.
