Hi there,

We are new to this list, and hope to learn more about air-cooled =
volkswagens here .
We are Dutch and our English isn't very well.
So most of the time it will be difficult enough to understand what is =
written.
But hey, you never know.
We own a 1955 Split Window.
We have a question about our oilcooler.
It seems like an electric blower is mounted on the oilcooler.=20
With an hot air outlet in the engine decklid.
Does anyone know more about this part? We never saw it before!
Pictures(not the best ones) from it are on our site. (see the heart of =
it)

Greetz,

Jan, Ans and the kids.
