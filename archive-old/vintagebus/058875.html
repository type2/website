Hi Terry,
Ouch!  Yes, the bracket on the tranny for the rear of the boden tube is a 
cast part of the tranny side plate.  To replace the side plate and thusly
the 
bracket you would need to remove engine, tranny and the left side RGB/axle.

Later 1970s type 1s (and 2s?) used a bolt on steel bracket for the rear of 
the boden tube.  We wonder if that would be installable for your problem.
If 
so you would need to use the late model short straight or longer straight 
version of clutch cable arm on the TO bearing shaft!  Otherwise the rear end

of the boden tube will not be aimed at the end of the cable arm on the TO 
shaft and the clutch cable will wear out about every 6,000 miles or so!  
BTDT!!
