Subject: I finally got some Bustime.

Hi Volks,

Things have finally calmed down for me this summer. Camp and grad
courses  are finally over.  The plus is that my 5 month old is going to
bed and sleeping the night and my 5 year old is down the jersey shore
with her grandparents.  I finally got some time bustime! I haven't
touched my '66 Deluxe in I don't know how long.

Well, I stripped out the interior, took out the windows, and removed the
bumpers.  I am still amazed at how solid the splittie is. I started at
sanding away on my gem. I took my DA sander and went at it. Dust
everywhere!  I have one side almost completed and will tackle the rest
in the next few days.  How do I know the surface rust is gone from the
metal.  At places there is still a hint of black.  Is that rust?  I'll
be taking pictures and posting them soon.  Anyone going to Manassas,
have an engine lid for the '66 that they want to sell?  I'll keep you
all posted.

-Auker
