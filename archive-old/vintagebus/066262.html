Subject: RE: [VB] 23 Window Project - $2,500

&gt;He just turned 22 &lt;

As a dad I would get pissed and kick him out too.

I think dad sees all the time and money spent on the cars and not enough 
time getting his own place and moving out.

Ahhh, &quot;boomerang&quot; kids.

I would imagine the bus will be an easy sell.


Later,
Adrian
