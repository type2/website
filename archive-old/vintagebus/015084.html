Subject: 30p1 carb replacement
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

hey all, i haven't written lately because i haven't
been getting mail for some strange reason. if somebody
know's why, let me know. it just mysteriously stopped.
anyway...

the reason i called was because i am replacing my 30
pict 1 carb tommorow and was looking for some
suggestions as to things i should watch out for, or
maybe a link to complete instructions on this
operation. i could not find any myself. right now i am
soaking the parts ofthe replacement carb in carb
cleaner. parts like the spring, that golden colored
valve-thing (tech term), and the body screws. i also
cleaned off the rest of the carb with cleaner as much
as i could. i guess what i need to know is what ot to
do because i will probably end doing it if i don't.
this is a first for me and the bus is my daily driver.
so it's fairly important that  i tackle this tommorow.
if anybody is desperately wondering why i'm replacing
my carb, the body is worn out around the butterfly
valve shaft. this lets air in. air that offsets my
fuel-to-air mixture. so my bus does not idle after 3
1/2 mintutes (give or take 37 seconds). thanks for all
your time and help. as always it is greatly
appreciated. now you better get back to work before
your nosey manager catches you on the internet!
