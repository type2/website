Subject: RE: [VB] King Pin rebuild help is needed...

I have a home made tool which is much simpler.

It's basically a rectangular piece of half inch plate measuring
120mm X 60mm.  Onto this I have welded two legs made
from 20mm square tube about 250mm long. I have fishmouthed
the ends so a link pin will sit in them. (The legs are set just wide
enough apart so a link pin will sit with both ends engaged)

I just undo the king pin retaining bolt and sit the kin and link
pin assembly upside down on the rails of my press. Insert on old link
pin through the top link pin retainer (now on bottom
cos the assembly is upside down) and press down 
on the link pin using the tool above....

What for the pop and then jump a mile when it lets go
(I hate pressing stuff apart - always the startle response!).

regards

RobK

Subject: [VB] King Pin rebuild help is needed...


Hi I am interested in rebuilding my king pins on my
bus. I have a 20 ton hydraulic press and see in my
bently there is some neet jigs for taking the king pin
spindles apart. 

I am sure I can fabricate something similar but would
love some ideas or even better specifications off some
originals or something other folks use.
