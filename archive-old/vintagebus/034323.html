I Decided to do all the bodywork on my 66 deluxe myself. The Welding was Fun
the Bondo work (I only used it to smooth out the welds honest) was easy.
But when can you stop glazing, spot filling and WET SANDING,
I've gone from 220 to 400 to 600 every time i think I'm done I find another
ding
Is this ever gonna end. I must be in HELL there's no other explanation.
Any body experts out there that know when enough is enough ???
