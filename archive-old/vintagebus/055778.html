Subject: Re: [VB] Hot Wiring a Bus

I had a driver that I lost my only key to when I was 16 or 17 and used the
hot wire system for months before the key turned up again.  I pulled the
three wires from the back of the ignition switch, pushing two of the female
connectors together is on, and touching the other to the two of them briefly
is like turning the key. disconnecting the wires stops the engine. I just
experimented with them until I figured out the combo and didnt manage to
f--k anything up, so I would think you could do the same as mine was a 67.
I dont think I had the under dash tray in that bus, so that might be an
obstical.

    I --think-- there are two black and one red and that I connected one of
the  black wires to the red(if the motor turns over thats the wrong black
wire) and then touched the other black to them to turn the motor. forgive me
if this last part is not accurate its been a while, I make copies of all my
keys right away now.

 ronnie no not him the other one

Subject: [VB] Hot Wiring a Bus


&gt; The 66 Kombi I just picked up has been sitting in a lumber yard for a VERY
long time.  So it goes to figure that the ignition key is missing in action.
I will eventually get around to getting either a new key or a new switch,
but I am going to want to crank it soon so i can see if the current engine
appears salvageable.  So I was wondering if anyone could tell me how to hot
wire start thie bus.  I assume you can jump a wire between between the
battery and starter some how, but does anyone know specificaly how to do
this? Maybe some of you California guys have done this before! Just Kidding
;^)
