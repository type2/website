hi guys, i need your help and opinions here.

i recently put my bus up for sale on VW planet, and now i have a very
serious offer on it.

the problem is, it appears i might be all talk, and no walk.  when i put
the ad up, i though, &quot;yea, if someone offers me this amount, i'd take
it&quot;, but now i am faced with it, and all the memories of me and my wife
and the bus, and how we took our honeymoon in it are coming back to me
in full force.  im sure some of you know how i feel. please tell me you
do.

anyway, i asked what his plans are for my bus IF he were to buy it, and
he said he owned a dealership in japan, and planned on doing a full
restoration on the bus, and shipping it to japan to sell there. now, the
idea of my bus going to japan doesnt turn my fancy, but i could
definitly use the money to pay off my credit cards that ive got left
over.

im just wondering what some of you guys might do if you were in my spot,
and what your views are about our buses going to another country, far
far away.  

im soooo torn.  im sure im going to regret either decision that i make,
but before i make it, i would really apreciate any/all input from those
of you that have sold buses that you really cared about.

thank you in advance.
