Subject: Re: [VB] Need info on Side-Loaders!

Hi Philip &amp; Catherine,

  I hope they kept the drop plank, looks like it would be very time
consuming to fabricate one again if they wanted to change it back!  A
while back on Everett's site he had a picture of a Single Cab from Auto
Trader that did not have the drop plank, but had the bed and passenger
gate cut out for a side loader bay, I could not see if it had the truss
from the photo.  I can't see why one would weld one on a single cab, so
you are probably correct in your assumption.

Best,
joe

&gt; We looked at a single cab for sale in Thousand Oaks, Ca. maybe a year 
&gt; ago and it had the rail (truss) on the bottom (for frame flex) but it 
&gt; was a single cab now maybe someone put it back. Just more information 
&gt; hope it helps.

&gt; &gt;   I bought Ronnie's well known Side-Loader about 2 yrs ago in Jerome.  I
