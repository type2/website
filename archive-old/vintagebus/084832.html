Yep.  The American Wire Gauge numbers go up to zero, and then just start
piling on zeroes.  In other words, it goes like 2, 1, 0, 00, 000, 0000,
and so on.  2/0 is another way to write 00, 4/0 is another way to write
0000, etc.  The guy at the electrical supply will pronounce these sizes
&quot;two ought&quot; and &quot;four ought&quot;.

2/0 building wire (probably &quot;THHN&quot;) is composed of relatively few
strands of relatively thick wire.  This is fine for fixed installations
where you have a lot of room to bend the wire, but doesn't work so well
in a car.  It's tough to bend and the thicker strands break more easily
with vibration.

2/0 welding cable will probably work better.  This is designed to go
from the output of an arc welder to the electrode holder or ground
clamp.  Since the holder or clamp will get moved around a lot, dragging
the cables around, this cable is made out of many strands of relatively
thin wire.  It's a *lot* easier to work with.

For instance, one catalog I have has both 2 gauge building wire and 2
gauge welding cable.  The building wire has 19 strands and the welding
cable has 665 strands.  They also sell &quot;battery cable&quot; which is in
between at 133 strands.

Another thing you have to look out for with pre-made cables is the
size of the hole in the lugs.  The site you quoted had lugs with an
0.5&quot; hole on the 2/0 cable.  This hole is so big that it probably won't
get much contact with the nut at the starter.  A lug with a smaller hole
would be better.  The electrical supply (and maybe even the welders
supply) will have lugs with a variety of hole sizes to fit various
gauges of wire.  What you might do is to hold up metric bolts to the
starter stud until you find a match, then take that bolt with you
shopping.  Within reason, it's usually better to buy a lug with a hole
that's just a bit too small and drill it out, than it is to buy a lug
with a hole that's way too big.

The lugs you get might be copper or silvery colored - both work about
the same.  The silvery colored ones will have color bands and/or numbers
stamped on the barrel, telling you which die in the crimping tool to
use.  The crimping tool is longer than your arm and really impressive.
If you want to use the &quot;official&quot; tool, you might see if you can rent
one at a rental place, or borrow one from an electrician - every
electrician that does anything more than residential will have one
somewhere.  Maybe find a big construction site, wait for the electricans
to come on site, and go by at lunch or quitting time and trade beer for
a crimp.

The other way you can crimp them goes like this.  Put the lug on the end
of the cable and squeeze it as hard as you can with a regular pair of
pliers, or Vice-Grips, or Channelock pliers.  This just helps the lug
stay in place for the next part: lay the lug on a clean concrete floor,
anvil, or vise, and beat it with a hammer until the barrel is as flat as
you can get it.  Give it a &quot;pull test&quot; (pull lug with one hand and wire
with another, as hard as you can) and if the lug doesn't fall off, it's
good.

Finally, you can solder the lugs on.  You can buy ready-made solder
slugs that fit in the lugs, or you can just feed in a lot of wire
solder.  Put the lug in a vise and heat it with a propane torch
(electric soldering irons won't work).  When it's hot, feed the solder
in until the barrel is about 3/4 full of melted solder, then feed the
wire end in, take the torch away, and hold the wire end still until the
solder freezes.

Of the above, I've used both the official crimp tool (since I have
access to one at work) and the beat-it-flat method.  They both work
about the same; the &quot;official&quot; tool makes a nicer-looking job than
beating it flat but a hammer is usually easier to come by.  Both crimps
have stood up to a repeated 144 V DC, 200 A load.

If you're really into it, wrap the barrel of the lug with electrical
tape, or cover it with heat-shrink tubing.  Use enough tape or tubing to
cover the lug barrel and a lug barrel's length of wire insulation.  This
reinforces the connection a little and helps prevent shorts to and
corrosion of the barrel.

One source for parts is Del City, http://www_dot_delcity_dot_net .  They have
all the bits mentioned above.  Their catalog used to say that they would
make custom battery cables and custom-stripe wire, but the current
catalog doesn't mention it, so I don't know if they still do it.  I have
also ordered 12 V relays from them for $3 each that turned out to be
genuine Hella, Made in USA parts.  One slight problem with the larger
battery cable sizes is that they only come on 25' spools.  Maybe go in
with some friends and have a battery-cable party at the next VW show.
They also have a $25 minimum order.  I don't work for them or otherwise
get money from them; I have ordered from them in the past and gotten
good service.
