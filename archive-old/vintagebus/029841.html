Subject: and this list goes wild...

WOW is all I have to say.  I'm sitting here grinning as I type this.  I
could care less what you guys think of my dealings.  If you don't like
them, don't deal with me.
Most of the people here b!tch about ebay all the time and how horrible
it is...but yet they're compelled to look at all the auctions daily.
Why?  Got me...  If you don't like it, don't look at it.  You guys are
going nuts over a 40 year old seat.
I find the list absolutely hilarious.  A b!tching forum really....even
the list admin get in on it.  It wasn't like this back when I first
signed on.  This is part of the reason I listed it...because I knew
everyone would go mad. Just to prove a point, really. People calling me
the &quot;poster boy of bad karma&quot; and telling me that I'm really not a bus
enthusiast.  That cracks me up.
I didn't put it on ebay with the intent of selling it.  If someone
wanted to give me 3K for it...well...fine then if you really want...
Thats their decision, not yours.

Steve, that wasn't the whole deal either.  There are some crucial points
missing, but thats beside the point....who would believe the &quot;poster boy
of bad karma&quot; anyways?

So...lets see how many people can flame me for this!  The delete key is
a marvelous thing...don't you agree?
