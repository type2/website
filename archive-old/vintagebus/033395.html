Hey, first of all, thanks for the info I received on the redux box question. 
Now, for the next one. Were there ever any panels that were placed inside the 
panel van?  And, are there any people out there with photos of their panels 
so as to reference? Thanks in advance!

the cab had grey hardboard panels on roof, doors, and in front of your feet.  
A diveder was installed above the metal partition in bench seat versions, 
with a glass window so you could see out the back.   in the rear, it was 
bare, grey metal.   no panels, no seats.
