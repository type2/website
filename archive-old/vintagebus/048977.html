I still have some Silver White, L82 from when I painted the bumpers and wheels on the '65 Double Cab.  It was PPG paint, and I think I still have the can with the PPG # and formula.  I'll check tonight and get back to everyone in the a.m.  Otherwise, PPG does have a cross reference number to L82.  Any PPG distributor should be able to look it up.

Robert
