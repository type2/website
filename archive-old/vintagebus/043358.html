&gt;This talk about that AM/FM radio has me thinking about my old Sapphire
&gt;AM/FM that doesn't work.  By the time I found Brad's radio repair he
&gt;wasn't doing it anymore. is there anyone who knows of a good car radio
&gt;shop?

You might enquire on the Usenet newsgroups sci.electronics.repair or
possibly rec.antiques.radio+phono .  SER is more about fixing it
yourself, but you can probably get some recommended shops.  RAR+P
is a bit more towards older home radios (1900s-1950s) but someone
there may also have a good lead for you.  I hope this helps!
