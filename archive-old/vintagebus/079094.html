Subject: Re: Trip Report N. Cal/Oregon/Shasta (addendum)

Just a couple more neat/goofy things we saw through our split screen as we
travelled...I noticed them from some of the video, and I thought them worth
the mention...

Swallows nesting in the eaves at a rest stop...neat birds!  If I was a bird,
I'd want to be one of them!

Amidst the endless displays of chainsaw sculpture all the way up the Pacific
Coast, one in particular stood out:  In Crescent City, I believe, there
stood a brontosaurus made entirely of redwood bark!

In the mid and upper altitudes, dogwood is in full bloom, and is lovely.

Lovely also, were the rhododendrons in full bloom alongside the road.  If
you've not seen this, it is quite the pleasant sight!

None of the Vanagon owners (even Westies) waved, but two bay drivers did.

In similar news, we got LOTS of attention from the Rainbow People who were
infesting the town and area of Mt. Shasta when we were there.  The big
downer of owning/driving a splittie is that certain folk believe that you
are one of them, and when you excercise discretion, the vibes are not so
nice.  I may look like a hippie, but I ain't, man!

In Oregon, where gas is just as expensive as in CA, there is one mitigating
factor:  It smells like gas!  I believe our engine ran cooler and stronger
on Oregon gas than it does on that in California.

It was fun watching osprey circle overhead and then dive into Castle Lake to
get fish.

I guess that's all...hope to see some of you out there next time!
