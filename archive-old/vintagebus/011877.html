If you are contemplating buying chromed parts or having yours
rechromed, this might be interesting.

Chrome plating isn't simply electroplating chromium onto the steel. 
If it were, life would be so easy!

Good chrome plating involves several steps.  

First, the surface has to be buffed smooth, as irregularities will
make plating difficult.

Second, the part is chemically cleaned to remove any residue from the
surface

Third, the part is plated with copper.  Copper sticks nicely to steel,
but chrome still doesn't stick to copper.

Fourth, the part is plated with nickel (I think, memory is getting
fuzzy with age). Nickel sticks nicely to copper, and chromium sticks
nicely to nickel (whew!)

Fifth, the chromium is plated onto the nickel.

There are intermediate cleaning/buffing steps that I didn't go into,
but you get the idea that chroming isn't just a matter of dipping the
part into a tank!

Obviously, such a complicated process is easier (and cheaper) to do
badly, which is why most &quot;chrome&quot; parts tend to peel and rust.  The
crunched back bumper of our beetle is sitting in the side yard with
still beautiful chrome despite 29 years of weather exposure, while the
Brazilian replacement is already rusting despite regular polishing
with chrome polish.  VW didn't scrimp on the chrome back then, and it
shows to this day.

It's the copper and nickel layers that prevent rusting, as the
chromium is brittle and will always have microscopic cracks that will
let rust through if the steel is exposed underneath.

If you're hiring chrome work out, ask about the process the shop uses.
 If they're hesitant to describe it, they probably skip steps.  Ask to
see examples of their work that have lived in the weather for a while.
 A bit of research at the beginning will save grief later!
