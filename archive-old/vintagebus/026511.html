his '54 Deluxe, that would hurt the value.

&gt;That's *exactly* why!  There's a gazillion '54 BD deluxes, and it's almost
impossible to tell them apart!   If mine was a nice original-paint bus, I
wouldn't dream of it, but since better than 30% of the car is either repro,
fabbed, or NOS pieces, why not?
&gt;
A good point.  People ask me all the time if I'm going to paint my Bus.
&quot;Yes.&quot;  &quot;What color?&quot;  &quot;Back to the original Dove Blue,&quot; I say.  50% of the
time, I see a look of &quot;yuck&quot; on their face.  Weird, Dove Blue rules IMHO.

I just have to wait until I grow up enough to be able to take care of a nice
Bus.  ;)

So... To whomever, do what you want, it's your Bus.

Then Thom said:
&gt;On the other hand, the registry shows the order of popularity being panel,
then standard, then deluxe. I went and did another seach for buses in the
USA, and deluxes came out on top.

Maybe I have the nicest OG Barndoor Kombi in the world?
