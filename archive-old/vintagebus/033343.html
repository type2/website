&lt;&lt; Hello,  I have a small problem. I got some new side mirrors for my bus
 and am having trouble getting the old ones off.  The mirror arms don't
 want to move at all. The nuts are off both and I've lubed them pretty
 well. Is there some trick to get these off ?  Thanks in advance. shawn
  &gt;&gt;
more lube.  Patience.  It depends how much damage you are willing to do.  
vise grip the arms and twist them back and forth may loosen them up, but may 
break the arms off flush, and often will leave marks in the arms.   
unscrewing the nut flush and tapping up with a hammer also works, just dont 
mushroom it.  Then again, could you put the new mirrors on the old arms?
