Subject: Re: RE: [VB] Help Getting rear drum off?

yes, definately try the de-adjusting the brakes method...

if the wheel spins it's not rusted to the shoes, so it's either stuck on the 
ridge with the shoes, or it is rusted to the spline.   This is because the 
spline was not greased.  grease is good splines should be greased, or it causes 
hassles like stuck drums to piss people off.  Grease the splines before sliding 
the rear drums back on.

If it is stuck to the spline, the unscrew the rear axle nut trick has 
actually worked for me.  I unscrewed it enough so a hair could fit between the drum 
and the nut, and used a cotter pin.   I went ahead and replaced the bad brake 
bits on the other three wheels (this was a bus I had just bought) and all 4 
brake hoses.    anyway, one day on the freeway the bus got REALLY squirrelly and  
yup, the drum had come loose and was slopping around.   This is probably a 
really unsafe method so keep your wits with you.   oh ya, and do not try this at 
home (standard disclaimer).  And definately carry the correct axle nut tool 
with you, so you can tighten the nut down when it comes loose.

And grease the splines of the axle shaft.  ;)

There is the hit the drum with a drift/hammer from the inside method, but I 
am guessing if the puller didn't work that method won't either.
