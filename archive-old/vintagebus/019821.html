This evening I fired up the '67 Westy for the third or fourth time.  Done that
before.  This time though, I put it into gear, and eased up the driveway.  That
went well, so I drove up to the highway.  Still doing good, so I took off.

Wow :-)

It feels SO good to finally drive my bus!  FYI, this bus was last driven in
1982.  So today was a major event!  I've worked on this puppy for quite a while
to get to this point.  Bought the bus with it sitting on the drums in the &quot;bad
part&quot; of Macon (if there is a bad part :-)).  To drive it, I:

Rewired it, rebuilt transmission (took two cores), rebuilt the engine in the
Kombi and put it in there, replaced all brake parts except metal lines and
master cylinder, replaced accelerator and clutch cables, swapped rims and tires
around, and miscellaneous other stuff.  

I noticed that the clutch pedal didn't want to come up all the way.  The bowden
tube has the right amount of sag, so I'll have to look into that.  It brakes
differently than the Kombi since it's heavier and I think I didn't bleed the 
brakes too well.  I'm taking the bus to have the system pressure-bled Tuesday.
I need to adjust the clutch a little, start putting stuff back, but other than
that it ran fine.  Engine and tranny were admirable -- I wish the RGBs didn't
leak!  Still working on the leaks.

Thanks for all the help over the past weeks in getting this bus back on the
road.  I admit it was a lot more work than I anticipated, and I did a lot of 
stuff on this bus that I've never done before.  It was really
frustrating sometimes, and always felt like &quot;just one more day&quot;.  But all the
effort paid off for me!  I'm very happy and excited to be driving my Westy!
After doing all the work, I've really gotten to know this thing...it feels
like I've moved up a level from simple ownership.

I've been told to take a shower, so I'm off.  Looks like I'm going to Florida
Wednesday :-)
