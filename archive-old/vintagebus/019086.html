&gt; Are the bumpers on a deluxe the same as on other splitties ?
&gt; (I know they have extra trim on them, but are they the same shape, ...)

Yes.

&gt; About that trim :
&gt; Everything is with the car, but i noticed that the bolts to attach it to the
&gt; bumper are broken.
&gt; Is it possible to fit new bolts ?

Yes

&gt; The only things missing from the trim are the 2 pieces that are fitted on
&gt; each side of the bus (underside)
&gt; I haven't seen holes for them. Can it be that this splittie never had those

It's possible that they're bondo'd over.  Are you *sure* those are all that's 
missing?  I'll bet you a dollar you're missing more.

&gt; In front there are to single seats.(for one person)
&gt; And no, it's not a walk-thru.
&gt; Is this normal ?

There should be a split seat, the driver's side should be adjustable.

&gt; The seats in the back are missing.
&gt; Is it still possible to get those things for a reasonable price ?

Define &quot;reasonable,&quot; Mr Gates.  It's the middle seat that will break the
bank; there' sone up on my auction site, as a matter of fact...

&gt; Also most of the interior panels are bad or missing.
&gt; possible to find ? price ?

Doug Denlinger (sp) is the resident expert on this.  TMI makes what are supposed
to be really good ones, but I haven't seen 'em myself.
 
&gt; I've noticed some &quot;jail-bars&quot; at the side windows but not on the back
&gt; window.
&gt; Is this normal ?

No - sounds like you're missing the rear window jailbar.  There's also
one that goes on your phantom rear sear.  I'll take that dollar now, thank you very much!

I hope you're not paying too much for this car!  You have a lot of pricey
little doohickeys to buy!
