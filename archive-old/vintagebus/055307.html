Subject: Shift rod (rear) bushing(s) orientation Tube cleaning idea

Pulled my rear shift rod, front bushing basically gone.....Cleaning and
reinstalling this weekend.

Do both bushings (skirt section) face the rear of bus? Don't want to screw
that up.

For the cleaning idea, the tube most resembles a shotgun barrel. Mine is dry
(no grease), and has surface rust (from condition of rod), so my approach is
to use a shotgun clenaing brass brush with a solvent even, and a drill to
wire brush it clean. Any one use paint on rod or inside tube? I thought a
treatment/paint of some sort could be applied with a cotton swab also for
shotgun cleaning.
Of course, liberal greasing before reassembly.
TIA,
AL
