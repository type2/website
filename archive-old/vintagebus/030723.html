&gt; For example... could it possibly be the &quot;sliding seat&quot; as previously mentioned?  Mine does have a
&gt; bench, non-walkthrough, that has a multi-positional seat.  It has three positions, for both back
&gt; and bottom halves.

Speaking of this, does anyone out there have any close up pictures of these 61/62 only 3 position
seat brackets installed in a bus?   Can you send them to me or post a link??

I'm putting the correct seat back in my 62 and need to see which way the brackets are orientated.
Ideally, I need a picture of both the top and bottom brackets.  Not so close that you can't see them
in the context of the area (i.e.: need to see the seat pedestal and the bracket together to tell
which side faces in and which faces out).  In TV and movie terms its a called a medium close up.

Thanks!!
