Subject: Re: [VB] neverending story chapter 26

Reminds me of an incident I had years ago.  I bought one of 
those Scan deep-sump thingies.  It looked beautiful, installed
it and drove for a while.  The next time I changed the oil, I
removed the sump plate.  WTF is this?  There was casting sand all
over it!  I reached my finger up in to the recesses of the
sump - yup, more of the same.  It was also in the main sump. 
All in all, a big freakin mess.  That motor was never the same
after that.
