Hey ANdrew did you ever dig up your m-code tag.  sounds like you have a 
special bus.  kinda wierd, hadn't heard of sub floors on buses that weren't 
double doors both sides or sunroof buses (that includes buses w/ dormobile 
top), either

Curious,

Clara

 While on the way to a Savannah show with Dave Easterwood, I brought up the 
fact that the sub-flooring (belly pans) on my Westy needed some work, and how 
should I go about it?  Dave sez he has not seen a Westy with a complete 
sub-floor in it, only one '67 that had the outer sides but an uncovered 
center section.  My '67 SO-42 has a pop-top, and with it being the only 
pop-top Westfalia I'd examined in great detail, I assumed *all* of them had 
sub-floors.  It is my understanding now that they do not.  Raistrick's '66 
SO-44 lacks a sub-floor, for example.  So I'm wondering how my bus wound up 
with one, a complete one no less?  Factory goof?  M-code?  Any other folks 
with turret-tops and sub-floors?  I checked the archives, seems like only 
sunroof buses and double-doors had 'em.  I'm planning to unveil the M-code 
plate tommorrow...it is currently covered with shag carpetting.
