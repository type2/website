Stephen:

Without restating everything you've already stated, your dilema seems to be over money.  Welcome to our little club.

I was in the same position as you when I purchased my '65 Double Cab 15 months ago. No bed, no floorpans (after I personally removed all of them), needed new outer rockers, needed a front rain gutter, needed a jacking point.  I had no experience at body work either, so I shelled out significant denaro.  After going thru the process and participating with friends and folks I hired, now I feel confident at doing the majority of the work myself.  I just don't have any freekin' time anymore.  The good thing is that the '65 is done.  Well, I still need to paint the chasis, high zinc gray primer sealer, thanks Eric.  I was going to do it black, yikes!

What you need to remember is that DC's are becoming valuable vehicles.  If you purchase one in the $3000 range including shipping, spend $2000 on mechanical work, easily spend $3000 on bodywork and paint, and $1000 on panels, headliner, replacing missing parts, etc. you're into it for $9000 but if done right, should be worth $12ish today.  

Remember, you don't have to do everything TODAY, unless there's something going on that I don't know about.  Take your time, learn about each step, do what you can and hire out the rest.  Establish small blocks of work so that you can see progress.  Set a gameplan and try and stick to it.  If it's important to drive it, do the mechanical stuff first so that you can use it while working on it.  Obviously at some point you'll have to park it.

As far as body imperfections go, most of the *problems* with the buses you've listed don't seem to be mountains that can't be climbed.  It's kinda 6 of one and a half dozen of another.  It always seems to work that way.  Either the chasis is solid but a tree fell over on it, or the body is great but someone decided to make a fishing pond out of it and the pans and frame are shot.  Most anything can be fixed, pulling, cutting and welding, that's the game.

Take Muir's advice, go home tonight and assume the good ole lotus position and contemplate your choices.  Then remember that probably within a month there will be another 5 choices.  One will come your way, whether the right one or not.  Just take a leap of faith and make it work for you.

Robert
