I have had lot of folks from the list ask about the puck, but shy away  from 
the price. I need the $ so I have lowered the price $1,000 to $3500 2k 
cheaper than the one in vw planet  picture classifieds. Also, I have the 
piece that attaches to the end of the couch by the door and folds down, it 
just isnt pictured. for the record this puck had new floors put in a few 
years ago and they are solid. The prices on all my buses are flexible.
