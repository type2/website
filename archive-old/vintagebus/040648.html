Does anyone have any original type 3 &quot;cool tin&quot; they'd like to sell?  I
know there's aftermarket pieces, and they're junk.

&gt;I wouldn't say that.  I drive type 3 daily and have built motors using
both, never noticed a difference.  I guess if you want to split hairs the
genuine stuff is better, but that doesn't make the aftermarket ones bad.
