In a message dated 98-09-01 12:29:53 EDT, you write:

&lt;&lt; The only significant missing parts are the back bumper and the apron - the
piece of bodywork that goes behind the engine. I have access to one from a
later model bus - a '69 - and wondered if it would fit, or could be easily
modified to fit. If anyone is familiar with this, or if you know the
whereabouts of a reasonably priced rear bumper and apron, let me know.

Hi, 
Unless you are a wizard at sheet metal fabrication, you best bet is too get
the 1955-67 rear apron.  You should look at VW wrecking yards and swap meets
for the parts you are looking for or try the type 2 list classifieds for adds
or putting your own in there.   Eric &amp; Barb
