Well Volks - here's some observations on the engine I tore down today.  My
brother and I noticed that there is a visible gap between the piston and
cylinder on all 4 of them.  It's more noticeable on the side that had the
low compression.  I can actually move the piston side to side in the
cylinder by putting pressure on the piston face and moving it.  I assume
that this is too much of a gap and could be the partial cause of the low
compression?  I'm getting the heads looked at tomorrow to see if they could
be to blame in part as well.  Thanks for reading!
