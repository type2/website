Subject: Re: [VB] Security Device

I think most such devices are to discourage the 'need a ride' 
thief, ie the ones who want to *use* the car.  Yes, there have
been cases of people stealing a car, and then using it to drive
to work and whatnot for a short while, and then *selling* it.

I'm certain the VW's being stolen are being chopped up for parts,
maybe even being exported somewhere else, so these devices are
like so many gnats on an elephant's a$$.
