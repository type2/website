Subject: Why Tur-kay Warning! (;-P)

US residents take heed!

The Why Tur-kay panic is upon us! Even our Government has been caught with
their pants down lately!!! Sound the drumsticks and pray for times of gravy
on the wing. Prepare your family now or you'll be hungry. Thanks are given
for our family's preparedness. I'm armed and dangerous-ready to make sure
that no one takes MY food. Vagan staples on the side. Water? nope I switched
to 'Golden' cashe standard for now. Chilled and bottled just in &quot;case&quot;. My
supply chain has been pulled just in time to prevent a calamity. Hopefully
this message will find yours pulled as well!

Hey, are you 'Why Tur-kay' compliant?

Safe and securely over this problem, I will be able to resume wrenching on
my analog VW beast in the morning.
Cheers to all,
-VanBondo
