&gt; Should the emergency brake cables go THRU the beam or over the top of 
&gt; it?

Hi Rex,
Well over the top goes our's in metal tubes in our 1960 walkthru panel camper 
conversion, and this is with a 1966-67 front beam in it.  We have to have the 
E-brake cables for the 1964-67 rear suspension shortened and found a &quot;Wire 
Rope&quot; supplies who could fit on new swedged ends to the right length!!!  Only 
the clutch and speedo cables go through the front beam.
