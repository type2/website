Subject: Re: [VB] JCWhitney tie rod removal tool - not worth the money

someone posted this link to the list a while back. has anyone tried this one
out yet?

http://www.pelicanparts_dot_com/catalog/shopcart/ptoo/POR_PTOO_miscel_pg4.htm#it

&gt; Just for the record, this tool is worthless in my opinion. It cost $9 +
&gt; $9 shipping (rip) and does not do the job. It is hard to keep mounted
&gt; on the joint/union area. The bolt that is used to push out the tie rod
&gt; bolt, spins off when tightened (it should be bigger with a recessed end
&gt; or have a welded on flat cap to increase surface area). This is one of
&gt; those tools that seems &quot;fashioned&quot; after an original tool - but not
&gt; produced by a tools company.
