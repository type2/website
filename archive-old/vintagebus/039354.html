Hello all,

You all are probably sick of hearing about safaris, but looking through 
Thom's site, I noticed the Bentley how-to on safaris and they are showing an 
installation of threaded mounting plates for the hinges of the safaris.  
From what I have heard from the group, other than OG, the CE safaris are the 
way to go, which I plan to get, but I think someone said they do not come 
with these plates.  What do you suggest?  Will I need to fab my own and 
install them as per Bentley?  These are going into a '62 DC so I hear there 
will be beating and grinding involved.

Much thanks,

Alex
