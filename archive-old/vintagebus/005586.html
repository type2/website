The argument for roofing tar as window seal sealer has got me
convinced...Would it be better, then, to use a coating of roofing tar as
undercoating instead of the layer of Rustoleum &quot;Hammerite&quot; and then
rubberized undercoating as a reinforcing layer?

Also:  I recently became aware that I am missing a part of my bus.....and
that is the front underpan...am I going to be faced with a problem when
looking for one of these things for my '67?

&gt; &lt;&lt; anybody know the difference between asphalt/petroleum fiber/non-fiber
&gt; tar/coating/sealant roofing products and the &quot;plastic &quot; varieties ? &gt;&gt;
 undercoating
&gt; products once rust gets under them acts like a greenhouse for the rust to
run
&gt; wild!
