&lt;&lt; This is not about the front door panels, but the door panels that are for
the
 back area(Not sure what you call those doors). My existing door panels go
from top to bottom of the door, with a hole cut out for the window. As far as
I know these are original panels.  &gt;&gt;
Hi Kevin,
Here in the USA side doors are called cargo doors (Panel Wings according to
VW.) and the door on the upper rear is the rear hatch (Rear panel lid
according to VW.).  We have not seen any stock door panels that go to the top
of either of these doors.  Could be a dealer or PO modification.  Eric &amp; Barb
