Subject: Re: [VB] blurred plates

Thom Fitzpatrick mentioned the possibility in some
locales to track down peeps via the lic plates. Also
mentioned an incident of nastiness which resulted in
such tracking.

The State of AZ passed a law years ago due to such of
a  spurned stalker/ guy-girl homicidal incident. Alot
of folks tend to meet potential buyers at locations
unassociated with the vehicle's real home base.
Recently, a rich dude barely escaped an attempted
murder/car jacking of a big buck RV rig at his
exclusive residence.
Bottom line is that you never know whats up and it's
best to be prepared and protect self as self decides
is  appropriate. Lock and load, safety off, bayonet on
and THEN love and peace.

Early Friday comment: 
Yesterday I got waved at in the Land Cruiser by
another Cruiser Nazi. Cracked me up as I haven't been
waved at since I quit driving aircoolers. No one waves
at F150's but its easier to blend in at the Go-go
bars. ;-) &lt;like I have the time...&gt;
