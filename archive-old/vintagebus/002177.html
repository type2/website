&gt;&lt;&lt; does anyone know the cost of blasting a panel bus? i am entertaining the

I went to this site last night from someones message onlist, its a neat site
and worth a read, but it has plans for making a sandblasting unit that seem
simple cheap and looks like it would would work a treat. Save $'s bigtime
and do it yourself
