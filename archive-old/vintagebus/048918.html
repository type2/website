I've been following Stephen G.'s wild search for a Double Cab for the past month or so.  Reminds me so fondly of my crazed search a year and a half ago.

The main thing I've noticed is how *honest* Stephen is with description's, phone numbers and addresses of potential pickups.  I'm afraid for Stephen that this is good for a lot of people, but maybe not him.  Unfortunately there are what we've always called &quot;sniveling unknown lurkers&quot; on the list who hunt and prey on buses and parts without ever contributing a thing.  We've seen it happen with other buses that listmembers have mentioned.

Anyway, I couldn't decipher Stephen's email address from his posts, so I thought I'd try and reach him publicly.  STEPHEN, BE CAREFUL WHAT INFO YOU PUT OUT THERE, especially if you really are serious about the bus.

Sorry, I hate to think in the negative realm, but it's reality.

Robert
