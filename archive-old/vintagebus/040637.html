&gt; Can a '70 tank be modified for an FI setup?

FI requires a send and return line, which would mean putting an additional
nipple on the tank (perhaps could be done by welding, never heard of anyone
trying it).  But this does not address the issue of physically fitting a '70
tank into a bus with a Type 4 motor (which are the only bus motors that were
FI).
