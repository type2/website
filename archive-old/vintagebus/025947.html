hello group!

I am getting ready to replace my freeway flier with a stock geared trans
and was wondering, do i need to take apart the reduction boxes to get
the axle tubes off the axles?

ive pulled trannies before, but i always kept the axles on, but now i
need to pull the axles and put them on the new trans, and have heard
both ways (you can leave them on, and, you have to take the redux boxes
apart to do it). but no for sure answers from anyone.

any things to look out for?  it seems like a pretty straight forward
process, but if i can get away with leaving the boxes alone, i'd prefer
it (they were completely gone through about two years ago when my father
was holding the bus ransom)

ok, ok, i sold it to him (my dad), but luckily was able to get it back
from him after begging for it since the day after i handed it over to
him.

any advice appreciated.

by the way, anyone looking for a transform freeway flier tranny with
about two years of driving on it?
