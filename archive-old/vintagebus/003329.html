&gt; i got a clutch kit from the bus depot in august, and it came with
&gt; an alignment tool.(little plastic thing star shaped, tube-like


I sell the clutch alignment tool separately for about $2.  Also it is now
included with some but not all of the Sachs clutch kits. (All of the '76-91
Sachs kits now include the tool, but it seems to be hit-or-miss on pre-'76
kits for some reason.)
