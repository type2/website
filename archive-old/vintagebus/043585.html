Hello all!

On Sunday the weather was nice and I got up far enough before noon to
get some good work on the Bus ('64 Standard, big nut, 1500 from a '68
Bug) done.  Changed the Porsche distributor for an 009 (still maybe 
not optimal but a lot better than the Porsche one).  Changed the valve
cover gaskets (again).  Changed the oil, a much needed operation as
the stuff in there was black black and kind of runny.  I don't think
it was diluted with fuel, just nasty from sitting without running for
several months (before I bought it.)  Screen looked good and there
wasn't a lot of goo on the drain plug magnet so that's a good sign.
I also found that there were (old) remnants of gasket on the sump
plate which might explain the copious amounts of oil on the bottom
of my engine.  The wire brush in my Dremel made very short work of
the gasket residue.  :)  Stomped on the brakes and they are solid - 
need a little adjusting but not spongy.  I went around checking
torque on the things I'd worked on, like making sure.  I also checked
the RGB/spring plate bolts - they were all tight, but the RH ones are
17mm and the LH ones are 19mm.  Interesting.  Put my non-beat-up front
top shock absorber bolts on - that was the thing I kept telling myself I
-must- remember to do before driving it.

I fired it up and noticed that the new belt was wiggling a lot, and
the generator was making some noise.  Shut it off to check shims and
I only had two inside the pulley.  Went to one shim as I couldn't talk
myself into going with none.  It was a little better but still noisy.
I think the bearings might be going, and I need to check it out
anyway...I only had 5.3 volts at the coil hot wire at idle!  I timed
the 009 statically, and hooked up my fancy timing light to check it
while running.  Checked the dwell and the 009 was bang on 50 degrees
right out of the box.  Also did an informal &quot;cylinder balance&quot; test...
pulled one plug wire at a time.  1 3 2 were good for a 30-40 rpm drop
and noticeable change in sound.  4 only dropped 10-20 rpm and the
sound didn't change much at all.  Hmm.

Went for a ride around the block...and again...and then a little farther
the more confident I got.  It seemed to shift OK except for one thing.
Most of the time it would go into gear fine and as I let out on the
clutch it would smoothly take hold.  Once or twice, though, it seemed
like it went into gear OK but as I let out the clutch through about
3/4 of the clutch pedal travel, nothing was happening.  Then there
would be a bang! and a jerk and it would suddenly lurch into gear.
I know I need to adjust the clutch and check the tranny/RGB oil, and
I know my front shift bushing is shot.  I'm pretty sure that the
front tranny mount is in OK shape.  Is there any possibility that this
is something dire inside the tranny?  The engine definitely liked
the 009 and the fresh oil.  It was glad for the attention I think.

Brought it on back home and decided to do a compression test.  Survey
says... #1 90  #2 130  #3 115  #4 115.  WTF?  I went back and made
sure my gauge was screwed in real good on #1 - still 90.  Three shots
of oil from a hand can and #1 comes up to 125.  Hmm.  Rings anyone?
I also wonder if the higher compression on the right side has anything
to do with why my muffler didn't want to fit (head flycut too much?)
Both of my heads are 311 101 373 A, but the right one has a VW logo
and the left one has no logo and says &quot;Mexico&quot;.  Hmm.

Also noticed that my case has the notation &quot;WB&quot; stamped in it on the
rear vertical surface between the distributor and fuel pump holes.
The letters are half the height of the engine number - they look
like those standard machine-shop letter punch sets.  I wonder if these
are the initials of the person or shop that rebuilt it?  The lady
I bought the bus from bought it in the Bay Area about 10 years ago.
(Trivia: The carpet currently over the floor mat in the back came from
a Stanford building (dorm? I think) that was damaged in the World
Series quake, according to her.)

I'm just glad to have it running pretty well.  :)  I still need to
do a lot of things, like grease it, tranny/RGB oil, maybe some
shocks, maybe some tires...In just a few short years I'll be
wandering the VW shows of Southern California, searching in vain
for those &quot;correct&quot; one-day-only license plate screws...

Also it's a good time to say 'Thanks' to everyone on the list!  I knew
a little about VWs last summer when I joined but now I know a lot more,
because of the good info I get here.  So, thanks!

Matt Roberds
