009 would be about 7.5 degrees BTDC in my experience static setting.  If
you get too much total advance, set it back.  I always set mine for total
and don't worry too much about the starting point unless it starts to look
very off, then something is wrong with the distributor.   28-30 total for
sea level, stock engine.  Usually it seems like the 009s kick into total
advance pretty quick, by 2500 I think, but just rev until it doesn't go
any farther.  Usually de-tuning makes them run cooler, but if you are ten
degrees back that's quite a bit.  I've never run one that retarded so I
don't know if it would cause heat or not.  Seems like it would be
ineffecient burning and would run the exhaust and valves hot since it
would be burning late.
