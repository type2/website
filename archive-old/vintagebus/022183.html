Subject: Cross-continent Hurst Bumper Tour
Mime-Version: 1.0

I just completed the 1st Annual North American Cross-Continent 
Hurst Bumper Tour (1 of 3 buses from east-coast to west-coast &amp; 
back).  14 days, ~5000 miles, 9 states, 2 VW shows...

Highlights:
Caravanning with Kris, Mark, Cletus &amp; Dwayne, OCTO, party after 
the Classic at Charlie's

Lowlights:
drunk making ass of himself at Charlie's

Best line overheard:
&quot;Sorry, DKB magnets don't stick to Hondas&quot;

&quot;The Camaro&quot; &amp; I made it home fine, both a little worse for wear...
I did buy new rear wheel cylinders at Vintage Parts...
I cheated &amp; put a 1600sp for the trip, but was running the split 
case bd tranny (I built a tunnel case &amp; put on bd reduction boxes to 
carry as a spare).

Only casualty was a 30-something year old 16&quot; bias-ply tire blowout 
in Oklahoma City on the way home.  Much easier than last years tranny 
swap...

See you there next year,

Dave
