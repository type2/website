&gt;So I guess this means I don't need to do a custom color?  It sounds like the
&gt;people in the know think that RAL 9003 (Signal White) is the best choice?
Now
&gt;what do I do about the inner and rear areas of the rims?  Do they get
&gt;semi-gloss black?  The reason I ask is I have an alomost mint, unused spare
&gt;tire rim that is white on the face, and the inner and back areas are a
&gt;semi-gloss black.  Also, do the bumpers get coated all white, or is it
just the
&gt;front that is white and the inside (area closest to the body of the bus) get
&gt;semi-gloss black as well?
&gt;

There's Paint on the other parts .... I thought the rust on mine was
factory installed.
