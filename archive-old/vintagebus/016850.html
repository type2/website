&gt; Hi Melissa and Jerry
&gt; 
&gt; Just wanted to let you know that I received your tape of the &quot;OCTO 
&gt; Meet, The
&gt; Toy Show, and The Classic 2000&quot; and finally had time to look at it 
&gt; all. It is
&gt; great! I wasn't able to go to the OCTO Show, but your tape sure 
&gt; showed me what
&gt; I missed. Your coverage of the Toy Show, and The Classic is first 
&gt; class!  I
&gt; saw a lot of listee's on your tape, and you have some very good 
&gt; shots of
&gt; almost all the vehicles. Put me on your list for the next coverage!
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks again,
&gt; 
&gt; Don Boneau
