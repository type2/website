Can't really help you over there, and I guess it's a US thing that you 
can't 'easily' buy vehicles with no title.  Over here you put anything 
back on the road , even a pair of chassis rails and a bulkhead is still 
a bus as long as you have the chassis number and plate.

How about stripping out the bus - well all the obvious and easy to get bits, then get your buddy to buy the shell for spare panels ...

...then have a bus re-assembly bbq!

Good luck though as this sounds like a bus that needs saving.
