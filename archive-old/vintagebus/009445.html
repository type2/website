While some of the isocyanates are highly toxic, are any of them used in 
epoxy primers?  From the work that I've done with epoxies, I remember that 
the curing agents, which are typically amine-based, are the nasty 
components in epoxy systems.  When in doubt, ask the manufacturer for a 
MSDS (material safety data sheet).

&gt; &quot;isos&quot; especially in an enclosed environment you need to use a positive

products for
&gt; quite some time with only a canister mask.  The key for me is that this 
is in
&gt; a outside environment.
