The classic sign of a front oil seal that's gone bad. When the engine
stops running, the oil can drain out past the seal easier, so you get a
little rush of oil until the seal is drained.

You need to pull the engine, take off the flywheel, and replace the
seal. Replace the o-ring in the flywheel while you're in there, if you
have one. Of couse, this is the time to do all that &quot;engine out&quot; stuff.
Check your clutch disk (it's probably soaked in oil), engine comp.
seals, axle boots. I'm sure you'll get lots more suggestions. 8^)

Have fun,

&gt; Hello all. Well I took my bus on a little road trip today and things
&gt; happen. I made my first stop for gas and noticed that I was leaking oil
&gt; pretty bad. The  oil  is coming from in front of the oil drain at one of
&gt; the case connection bolts. When the engine is running it will drip once
&gt; every 10-15 seconds, but when i turn off the motor it really starts
&gt; dripping. What the heck is going on?
