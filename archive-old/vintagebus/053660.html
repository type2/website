Subject: Re: [VB] End of long trip for Volkswagen bus in Mexico...???

&gt;  If the Beetle is still in production in Mexico
&gt;(and it shows little sign of ceasing) there will be an ample supply of
&gt;engines for Brazilian buses.


VW de Mexico announced that it would cease production of Beetles in 2002...
this was mebbee a year ago, when one of those mags toured the VW factories.
