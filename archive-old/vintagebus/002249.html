&gt;Yeah, but this guy wants to take a good double door panel and make it into
a half assed street/strip car.  Three things can happen.  1:  He'll do it on
the cheap, and with the first tromp of the pedal the whole thing will twist
up like a beer can.  2:  He'll do it on the cheap and shove it right through
a school or a tree when he notices the brakes are a bit lacking at high
speeds.  Or 3:  He'll do it right and go broke doing it, and be forced to
sell it at a loss, but who'd buy it?

Vintage originality isnt my bag, baby.  But i find this list to be helpful
and informative even to me.
&gt;It's all about keeping them alive, on the road, and in use.  That's why so
many of us are upset, 'cause baby, you can kiss that bus goodbye.
