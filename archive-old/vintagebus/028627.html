&gt; Since it's Friday, I had a question:
&gt;
&gt; Isn't Kabayo slang for Heroin?  That would appear to undermine your position
&gt; as a proponent of an underdog political party.
&gt;

Everett,

According to MULTIPLE drug slang listings Kabayo = heroin.

but did you know that
The &quot;Paaway sa Kabayo&quot; held on July 25 in the Phillipines is
    &quot;An exciting and thrilling and oftentimes bloody fight among studs for
supremacy over a female horse. More than 100 horses have been trained solely for
this event.&quot;   And we fight about busses! Ouch.

Also,  Kayayo-kabayohan the Phillipine name for a species of thorny seahorse
(Hippocampus histrix)

Kabayo is the Phillipine (tagalog) word for Horse

So to full circle on your slang,
     Heroin = horse -&gt; caballo (spanish word for horse) -&gt; kabayo (tagalog)
     note: caballo and kabayo are pronounced identically, the llo in spanish
sounds like yo

Bus Content:
I will Finally be getting to paint my crew this summer and after much thought,
consideration and kicking it around, I have opted to keep it the original color
(L245 - Lt Gray) rather than the two tone L245 on the top and L337 (Dolphin
Blue) on the bottom.  Aside from making things simpler, there is nothing like
keeping the classic look of the working truck.  Those stained and varnished oak
slats should contrast nicely with the light gray paint.

Scott
