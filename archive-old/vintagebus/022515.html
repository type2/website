&gt;in a nutshell,   my 67 and her last 27 owners thought they knew what they
&gt;were doing... however my electrical system seems to be less than Frau
&gt;Nordhoff designed it to be...  Any clues as to the best after market
&gt;harness...?????

Frau Nordhoff?  Who's she?  I think you mean to say St. Pon

There's only one source of aftermarket harnesses, but a choice of who you
buy 'em from.

This is the guy who makes 'em.  I've bought 2 from him, and recommend him
strongly.
