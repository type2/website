Steve,  I live in Ann Arbor, MI.  Not exactly Saginaw, but it's not to far.  I
do know of a nice '78 Standard Microbus for sale in Ypsilanti.  I just found
it last night so I haven't been able to talk with the owner yet.  The sign in
the window said asking $1,500  
It was dark when I saw it, but I could tell it was in nice unrestored shape
and couldn't have been from Michigan.  (hardly any rust)  
If you're interested in more info Email me 
If you're interested in hanging out with other Michigan folks, check out:

Gotta run,
         Eric Stollsteimer

         '75 Standard Microbus
