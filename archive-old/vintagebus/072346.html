&gt; The windshield wipers in my 67 only worked in low so I pulled the motor 
&gt; assembly out and when I removed the cover one brush and spring fell out. The 
&gt; other 
&gt; two look in sad shape. Can anyone guide me in a direction to find some 
&gt; replacement brushes or other sources of knowledge in this area? Thanks in 
&gt; advance.

I used a set of brushes from a 68 bay. The holder assembly was identical. I 
hope this helps. Mike
