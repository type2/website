Subject: divorce forces sale !

Hi volks (if I may plagerize),
This is my first post to the list. Too bad it's a bummer (for me anyway). 
I live in Sacramento, CA.
I have for sale a baby blue/white 1963 VW bus with a Sundial camper kit
installed. It has a bench seat in the front, so it started out as a ? . The
prev owner told me he bought the bus gutted and installed the camper kit,
bumpers, chrome bits, etc.
The body has a big owwey on the driver's side that was kinda pounded out,
sealed up and painted over. The hull integrity is OK, that section just
don't look so good. I bought the bus to go camping so I wasn't too worried
about the outside appearance.
It has a fairly new 1600cc dual port motor and is quite zippy. It seems to
cruise well on the freeway _at_ 60, and surprised me with it's zippiness
around town. It does need some fine tuning. It seems to be boggy in between
1st and 2nd gear.
I used to own a '72 and this one seems to be a lot quicker and feels like
it handles better. Of course, it could all be in my head.
Anyhow, I bought the bus trying to recapture my former life as a VW
camperista, and really don't know much about these older busses. It looks
good, but is more than I can handle right now.
Last week I replaced a burned out headlite and somehow killed the battery.
All the other lites work, but the headlites act as if there's a circuit
breaker that keeps tripping. They come on and then go out ??
I am too deep in the throes of my divorce, and lost my garage, so the poor
bus is sitting out in front of my new apartment in the street.
It seems to be a good runner and the overall impression is it's a good bus.
If I could get my $1800 back out of it, I would be happy. The fees are paid
on the registration, and I'll get the electrical problem fixed.
I usually go to Frank's Automotive in Sacramento for repairs and service.
They have always been very good to me.
Anyone interested please e me... cafeboy_at_pacbell_dot_net
Help give this little bus a good home for Christmas...
