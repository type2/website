&gt; has a 3.88 rancho--the two side plates that hold the axle boots LEAK!!
&gt; could be dried up gaskets because truck was not driven much--do not feel
&gt; like pulling tranny for just a pair of gaskets--so can i CHEAT and slit
&gt; the gaskets to fit onto the tranny and seal with sillycone or some other
&gt; sealer?? has anyone tried this short-cut?? results?? or ?? pull tranny
&gt; and do it right?? talked to a person who slit 3 gaskets per side,
&gt; staggered the slits and used a sealer and never leaked again!! i'm open
&gt; to your opinions and or ideas--thanks


Uncle Jerr,

I did exactly that last year for a leak in my 67, and have had no problems
at all, even after two long trips. I use and recommend the Permatex 3H
Aviation sealer (brown goop that never really hardens - sets quickly). GB
had recommended that sealer for case sealing on rebuilds. when ever I run
an engine which has been sealed with it, it never leaks. All engines I
have run using the blue sillycone stuff have leaked. In fact, the leak at
my axle tube retainer plate was fixed by scraping off the blue stuff which
had been used, and slitting three gaskets, coating them with the 3H, and
setting them in there, all slits were placed at the top - no staggering
needed. Clean the existing goop off immaculately before resealing and
regasketting. You do not have to remove the tranny to do this , just
remove the six 13mm nuts around the retainer plate, and you have two
inches or more to work in. No problem - use a good light, and get
comfortable. DO drain your tranny oil first, as well as your boxes oil.
Loosen your split boots as well so the work doesn't strain them. You can
check your oil for metal while you're at it. If you drain the oil into
an immaculately clean pan, you should be able to reuse it. If you're
planning
on reusing oil, clean the drain plug areas well so no dirt falls into the
oil. If you want to jack up the car for better access, do not forget to
loosen the boots and don't retighten them til the car is back on the
ground in operating position.
