Subject: SHIMS OUT!!! Some advice neede.

WOO HOO!!  After MUCH turning of the engine end over end and creative work
w/ magnets I have the two dizzy drive shims outta the case... some of you
may remember that I stupidly dropped em in while pranking w/ the dizzy
drive, and then DOUBLY stupidly listened to a friend who admits he was in a
bad mood that day to 'just run it, they won't hurt nothing.'

Well... yes and no. They did two things:
1. wedged between the case and the cam for a moment, and beveled the 1/8&quot;
of the  front (fif) edge of the cam quite nicely and
2. got between the cam and the interior of the cam chamber, and scraped
some paperthin strips of case off - kinda like a chesse grater.
The 2 steel dizzy shims are a little bent, but INTACT, which means no steel
pieces went into the oil.
I took the gen stand, fuel pump stuff, dizzy drive, oilsump plate and the
t3 dipstick plate off (universal case) and looked everywhere inside the
case with a magnet. No steel bits anywhere, and the cam and crank gears are
somewhat less than perfect, but no pieces missing, cracks or divots.
Oil screen did have a fair amount (thumbprint full) of thin scrapings of
soft, silvery metal - I torched it, and it was mainly magnesium (burned
like a flare) with a few small flakes of aluminum (turned white and
vanished). I am assuming this is the material scraped off the engine case
and the front of the cam gear.

Advice wanted:  as this was a good, strong runner before I goofed it up, I
am reluctant to tear it down completely and put in new bearings (which I
can't afford), and am leaning towards flushing clean oil through it 2 or 3
times, watching for bits of metal and odd noises, and then just running it
as long as it lasts. I am assuming no metals harder than the bearings got
in the oil. And  we all have had mystery engines that we clean out and run
and run until one day -poof-.
Opinions? If EVERYONE says teardown is the only way, I guess I'll grit my
teeth; other suggestions are welcomed, too.
Ronnie, you said you've run engines damaged by shims before and they fairly
quickly lost rods - had these engines ingested the steel washers, or just
softer metals?
