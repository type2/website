&gt; You are right on about VWOA though. When I call dealers to ask about air
&gt; cooled parts, all I get is a snotty comment or a insulting giggle.

I've also read from some people where they've gone to their official VWoA
dealer and gotten some oddball parts here and there.  It's been my
experience that when I've gone to Williamson VW in Lincoln, I get the cold
shoulder although they usually have a really nice old Ghia or Bug undergoing
a resto/repair in their shop.  A phone call usually goes like this:

Them:  Hello, Williamson VW
Me:  I'm calling from Beatrice about getting some parts for my VW
Them:  Okay one moment please
Them:  This is Bob in parts, how can I help you?
Me:  Yes, I'm calling from Beatrice and I've got a 1967 bus and
(interruption)
Them:  No - we wouldn't have anything like that.  It's pretty much all been
obsoleted.
Me:  Okay thanks for you time.
Them:  Sure.

So if VW really thinks they are losing out on massive amounts of money, then
why the hell don't they tool up and start putting out quality parts on the
market instead of just going around searching for someone making elcheapo
get-by parts?

I despite VWs tactics - it's almost enough to make my put a GMC Safari or
Mopar badge on my bus and call it a mini-van.

How about a bumper sticker that says, &quot;No Thanks to VW.&quot;
