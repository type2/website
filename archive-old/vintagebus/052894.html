&lt;&lt; I've been running my generator with both slots covered with the plastic 
covers that came with it for over ten years - never questioned it, no 
problems. It's a 67 with 12V. I'm not clear what if any problems this might 
cause. Can you tell?     cal &gt;&gt;

Hi Cal,
If the generator gets hot enough it can wipe out the grease in the generator 
bearings, and can cause the insulation of the windings of the field coils or 
armature to fail.  Even when early VWs and Porsches used a metal band like 
cover for the brush openings there were louvers to vent there.   Eric&amp;Barb
