This is driving me crazy.  I pulled the alternator pulley off to change
the belt, and not only was the pulley nearly rounded out in the middle,
but the woodruff key was only a sliver, and the half-circle groove it is
supposed to fit into was about as wide as it is long.  What is this all
about?  I keep the belt at the tension it's supposed to be.  The
replacement alternator I bought is a polished Motorola, and I have a new
chrome pulley.  I don't want to thrash them.  What gives?
