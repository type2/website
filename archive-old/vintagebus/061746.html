Subject: [VB] Another accelerator pedal linkage question

This one is about the accel pedal SPRING on a 67.  I had some sticking
in the linkage so I took everything apart, including the cable, and
greased it.  And I ordered a new pedal spring.  From what I could see,
it didn't look like the old one was having any effect on the pedal so I
thought it was broken.  When I got the new spring from WW, to my
surprise it turned out to be the same shape and length as the old one. 
So my next guess was that the PO had taken apart the pedal and just put
the spring back in wrong.

So the question is:  what is the RIGHT way?  One side of the spring is
3mm longer than the other, and so far I have guessed that it is the
short end that slips in the slot under the hinge part that is welded to
the floor.  This leaves a question about where the upright part of the
spring goes:  in front of the pedal pin, or between the pin and the
backside of the pedal?  I've tried it both ways and neither way seems to
provide much back-pressure to the pedal.  I had to guess that the spring
goes between the pin and the pedal because this arrangement at least
provides some resistance--but still not enough to be effective.

So, anybody still have an original pedal setup that can provide a
definitive answer?  Is this just a basic VW design flaw?
