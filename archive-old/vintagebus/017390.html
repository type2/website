Subject: tri-cities washington state

i'm considering a job offer in the tri-cities area of washington state.  i'd like to know if i'll have bus folks to hook up with in the area.  yup, that's right... if there are no bus folks, the job can take their incredibly generous offer and give it to someone who drives a h*nda or something.  &lt;grin&gt;
