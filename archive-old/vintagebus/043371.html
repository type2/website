&gt;Finally I have all exterior lights, blinkers and
&gt;high/low beams working.  My westfalia lights will only
&gt;turn on if the engine is on, probably not wired
&gt;correctly to the last fuse which is for the interior
&gt;lights.  

You're just talking about the inside dome lights, right?
As you noted, these should be wired to the last fuse
(the 16a fuse closest to the end of the fuse box - also
powers the brake lights and horn).  One end of this
fuse should have a huge red wire - this is the hot feed
from the back.  The opposite end of this fuse should
have three wires: black/yellow stripe (horn), fat red
(turn signals), and skinny red, the interior light feed.
The same end of the other 16a fuse should also have
three wires: black/red stripe (brake lights), black
(windshield wiper), and black (turn signals).

If you have four wires including a skinny red wire coming
off that next-to-last fuse, move the red wire over to the
last fuse and you're done.  If not, you'll have to follow
the red wires coming off of the light switch...one goes
to the middle light (on a regular Bus at least) and one
goes to the fuse box. 
 
&gt;Looking at the the westy parts manual it
&gt;indicates a fuse towards the back of the bus, could
&gt;this be my culprit.

If you're talking about the fuse in the wire coming off
the coil, this is for your back up lights.

Don't forget your friend in the wiring game,

I hope this helps!
