Subject: Re: [VB] transaxle front mount and nose cone bushing

Hi Mike,
If the bushing worked its way out, then just tapping it back in, most  likely 
will just have the bushing come out again.  So just remove the  tranny.  With 
it out you can do alot of maintenance/cleaning, and take off  the nose cone 
to have it checked for repair or replacement.  While you have  the tranny out 
you can drill and tap the RGB mounting holes deeper so you can  use 40% longer 
than stock bolts.
