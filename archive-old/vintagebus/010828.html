&gt; Hi Michael,
&gt; Why not get good used VDO gauges, and new senders?  VW 
&gt; rabbits used good 
&gt; quality VDO gauges here in the US, and can easily be found in 
&gt; almost every 
&gt; wrecking yard.  Did they not use the same out your way?

re senders and guages it seems that guages themselves rarely fail, while senders do.  I have been worried about my oil pressure the past week or so, as my guage would read 0 at idle and the light come on at idle above 80 degrees C (175 F).   actually paid a shop to hook up a guage to my bus, it read 12psi at idle, not 0.  I bought a new vdo sender, comes with a 2 year warranty.  The old vdo sender was dated 4/78.  I had found it on a case probably 5 years ago.  think it lasted longer enough. The new one is dated 9/99.  Okay the bus was working fine, but I was getting wrong info and feel much better to really know what is going on, don't want to throw a rod due to lack of lubrication.  Now my guage reads just over 10psi at idle when it has warmed up.

I like the idea of calibrating a sender, but then you need the tools to check it out, which unfortunately I don't have.

So buying a new sender instead of using one you find on a case is a good idea.  Wouldn't mind calibrating the old screw terminal ones for my 36hp though.

ps I went to Carl's Custom VW in Phoenix, and was impressed.  The guys there were friendly and knew what they were doing.  Pretty cool.

O - my guages are mounted between the package tray and the dash.  (oil temp and pressure).   I personally would not put them in the fresh air vent due to water getting into them.  Then again, it rains often in the PNW, in the desert I wouldn't worry about that.  I have the radio/tape player under the dash tray just to the right of the speedo pod, cause it doesn't fit in the radio hole.  I have a block off plate there, with a cigarette lighter in it (hole was already cut in the block off plate).  Now I should get a 12V coffee maker to plug into it.

Clara
