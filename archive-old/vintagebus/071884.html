&gt; Just looking for ideas.  I'd like to mount my CHT gauge as well, since I 
&gt; have it anyway.  Those of you with gauges, where do you like 'em?

Hi Joe,
We have our's bolted to the right underside of the speedo pod.  We have been 
thinking of taking a ruined dash ash tray and making it into a gauge cluster 
base.  With a trailer plug under the dash this gauge cluster could be even 
removable for show time.
