Ahh.:)

&gt; a gas heater would be opposite from the battery, there would be a
&gt; rectangulare hole cut into the area  forward to vent to the bus.    there
&gt; would be a  white pull knob under the pass seat to turn it on.

Upon further inspection (ie: with a light!:), i found the hole forward of
teh gas tank, for the hot air duct, and the hole for the exhaust pipe,
etc..all covered by various nonstandard coverings...What makes me wonder
is that the original owner (whom I got it from) never mentioned the gas
heater.  When I see him monday (to pick up the rear hanging cabinet), I'll
ask him about it.  I will check on the knob.

cool - glad I called that right- that may also be an extra dial for the heater
control , but I'm a bit fuzzy as it's a while since a drove that bus with an
Eberspacher.

&gt; Your bus has 23-44 stamped into the metal tag on the air vent?    You have
the

&gt; full width bed?  Are you sure they all came with tents?  Does yours have the

definitly has the full width bed.:)  And the tag on it reads:   SO44  231
1966

sounds so 44 to me- those seem comfy, but I haven't camped in one.
-. . . . . . . . 
As for the tent, the OO said he bought it with one.  But he tossed it a
few years ago, after the canvas rotted, sitting in his basment...*cry*

But, in the Germany Only lit I have (on the back cover:  &quot;The VW
campmobile versions shown in this brochure are only available in Germany
and cannot be delivered elsewhere), given to me by the OO, says Roof Rack,
under the &quot;standard equipment&quot; list, for the So-44 kit....And yet, I see
no signs of it ever being there...

I'm thinking that perhaps he had the rack, and gas heater, and optional
(according to the lit) 220 connection removed by the dealer, when he
bought it.  make it cheaper...:)  (Where the 110/220 plug is normally
(above left rear tail light) is filled with a bodyfiller of some sort,
when viewed from inside the engine compartment (easy to see, with the
engine and gas tank out, as they are now.......:)

Cool literature score.   Did the poles get tossed?    Try and find them.    My
65 so42  westy has no electric outlet- It was bought in Germany with us specs
and two tone- kinda neat.  Listings for US specs separately, not in one big
lump.  No westy code on over head vent, but definately came as a westy-
painted white in back and all.   Must be special order.  PPO was military.

did the poles get tossed with the tent?    Try and find them.  
The tent fittings would be either 2 or 4 shiny aluminium  bits sticking out of
the roof (spaced evenly_ on the cargo door side, or for the free standing
tent, a aluminium rail screwed to the rain gutter.  Look for holes drilled in
the rain gutter- I have seen that as evidence as a tent mount.

&gt;   You could post your M code tag on the list.

Hmm.  Here goes.:)

16 2
374 025 056 119 181
    2312 523320 6106935

(do note the lack of country or port codes...he said he picked it up in
wolfsburg....I think i believe him.:)

ya- but the number on the bottom right says *6* 106 935- this indicates it's a
66 model- check to make sure your numbers match.

  No port code ya- sold in Germany, then code for a combi, then paint colour
codes, - last 7 of vin, as I had said.

Made 16th of February (16 2) of 66, as it's a 66 (?)  Do you have the finger
opening gas filler cap and larger radio hole in dash?

374 - import specs for  N Am (I assume this- not listed though) - meaning
miles speedo, red tallights/sealed beam headlight/laminated windsheilds,
overrider bumpers
025 seat belts I think
056 steering/ignition lock
119  Eberspa:cher heater
181 chrome hubcaps 

&gt; Sounds like a cool bus.  

Yep.:)  I've been working on preserving the period stickers that have been
applied to the inside of the poptop.....More on doing that, and how it
works, later...:)
