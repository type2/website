Subject: RE: [VB] Splittie soft tops

I am wondering about those of you who may have a '66 or earlier ragtop bus,
(if they made them that late)

 They sure did make 21 windows with sunroof into 67. Stell after that in the
bays.

These were built before seatbelts were mandated and so they didn't have them
in even the front seats,

 Yes they did have front seat belts, my 66 has em stock. I don't think
there's an M code for them, so standard for that year at least sound right.

let alone the middle and rear.

I think the middle/rear belts attached to the wingnut mounts or clmaped to
the frames, I believe there's a thread on this in the archives. Not sure if
they CAME with them however. Perhaps rear.
