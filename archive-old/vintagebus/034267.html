   Just got home with the usable stuff from the Carcass of a '59 Westy.

    It has been sitting up to the rockers in rotting apples for at least
20+ years with no front glass (from the partition forward was completely
rotted out, almost no frame left, transfer cases were seized solid,
etc.)...

    I can decipher most of the ID plate but there are a few things I'm
not clear on...

    As Follows:

    29 12 9

    372  B23  168  175  181  544

    UV  231 SK  654C    551426

    544=?
 -- - -- - 
that's not in my book, maybe it's an mx code- severe rust
.  .. .  .. .  . . 
    UV= ?
 -- - - - 
sent to United States at port V (not sure which port) there is a port code
list on the NEATO webpage I think, UP is portland or, in theink UX is seattle,
wa,  etc   some codes vary  over time. 
 ..  .. .  .. . . 

    SK= ?

    654C= ?

this is for paint/interior codes- but I don't recall them being set up like
that- the earlier M codes, like yours, usually write the paint, and ignore the
interior, such as BLUE, for dove blue, or SRBG for sealing wax red/beige grey.
The later ones have a 6 digit code-2 digits for upper colour, 2 for lower
colour, 2 for interior colour, from what I understand.    But then again I
haven't looked at many early westies, and the 654C likely has to do with that.
I'd say SK was the exterior colour, but I don't know what .
 ..  .. .  . . .  
Before anyone asks the majority of the interior is spoken for.... You'll
have to talk to M. Heron (aka Ben Pon) if you need something...

    I would have loved to restore this Bus, but it was WAY too far
gone...

did it have the front turn signals?  The bit actually on the body, not the
bulb holder ot that stuff.  Some DPO cut them off my 59 truck and welded up
the holes, hooking the front turn signals into the parking lights in the
headlight buckets (MX 187?)  I'd like to have cones on there so I'm looking to
get the bumps and some metal around them from a hopeless cone turn signal bus,
if possible.
