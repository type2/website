Subject: Re: [VB] New Toyota

  If you're going to spout the Porsche jargon and acronyms please
provide legend.  PCNA, PAG, PCA???   I'm guessing Porsche Cars North
America, Porsche Germany and Porsche Cars America???

WTF?  Maybe a definitions page on VB ;-)

&gt; Like Porsche - about ready to debut an expensive as hell
&gt; SUV in the face of a huge recession, while other carmakers
&gt; are coming up with kinds of schemes to squeeze cars out the door.
&gt; PCNA got spanked by PAG for sending out $1000 off Boxster coupons
&gt; to the entire PCA membership.  The used 996 market has all
&gt; but collapsed, with even '00MY cars having lost 50% of their
&gt; value.  Mid-high mileage 993's can be had for the upper 20's now,
&gt; which were north of $80k new!
