Hi Andrew,
If the popping out of third does not adjust out and/or the fourth gear whine 
does not go away soon a a couple of hundred miles it sounds like you really 
need to get those fixed or a better tranny rebuilder.
  As far as the second gear syncro not fully working when the tranny is cold. 
 It will either get better as things polish up or you need to double clutch 
it when cold.  Eric&amp;Barb
