&gt; Hello all.
&gt;
&gt; I just bought a NOS turnsignal switch of the somba and it turns out that the
&gt; switch is for european models and i need to get european tail lights if i
&gt; want to use it.  has anyone come across this problem also?  does anyone know
&gt; a way i can use the switch with out trying to get euro lights? finally, if i
&gt; were to come across some euro lights can i use them in my bus with the
&gt; american harness?
&gt; i dont really want to go through the trouble of trying to get my money back.
&gt;   thanks in advance.

Actually you can use the &quot;American&quot; wiring, and switch while running Euro tail
lights. All you need to do is run a seperate wire from the brake sender directly
to the brake light, instead of through the turn signal switch.

If you want to retain the stock setup I have an American '66-'67 switch I would
glady sell, trade, etc. to you.
