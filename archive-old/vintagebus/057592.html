Subject: Re: [VB] wrong crank pulley/timing???

&gt; so, its sounds like you can't get it to idle, no
&gt; matter what you do or how 
&gt; you tweak the timing.  

I can't get it to run steadily, at all, much less
idle.

so seeing as it's a DP, do
&gt; you have a 34-pict carb?   
&gt; 9 out of ten times I have had the problem you
&gt; describe it's because of an 
&gt; icky gummed carb, usually a 34 pict.  If those
&gt; 34picts sit, they get gummy.  
&gt; Never had much luck trying to clean them out, though
&gt; I hear there is a secret 
&gt; passage.  Find an adaptor and put a 30/31 on there.

tried to rebuild the old 34 PICT, that didn't seem to
work, and the throttle pump was screwed up.  Bought a
new one (Mexican 34PICT) and the thing came the
closest to firing up.
 

&gt; re- pulley marks- ya it's hard to tell.  take a
&gt; spark plug out and use a 
&gt; screwdriver to see when the piston is closest to the
&gt; outside- that's TDC.  
&gt; use some liquid paper to mark it on the pulley- real
&gt; easy to see with the 
&gt; timing strobe light.
&gt; 
&gt; best to figure that out before you bolt the heads on
&gt; for greatest accuracy.  
&gt; But don't worry, it's okay.  just make it sound
&gt; good.   

When I was putting it all together, I used Muir's
methods to tell if it was TDC, so I think that's OK,
I'm pretty much over that route now.

I do the turn the 
&gt; carb adjustment screw in till it starts to die, then
&gt; 4  half turns out (or 2 
&gt; whole turns). If it has two screws then do the other
&gt; adjustment screw the 
&gt; same way.  this affects the first adjustment, so go
&gt; back and forth always  a 
&gt; few times till they're cool.   

I've tried screwing with the idle mix screw, which
seemed to help a little, and a little less with the
idle speed screw.  The problem is, if it won't run or
idle, I can't adjust it until it starts to die, as it
dies on its own!  Is there some magical position in
which these are fairly universal?  Bentley's says to
turn the idle mix all the way in, then 2.5-3 full
turns out.  Is there a formula like this for the idle
speed?

Now rev it up and let
&gt; it drop and listen.  You 
&gt; know you set the timing for what distributor you
&gt; have, right?  not the case #.

Right.  In my case (pun intended) the case and dist.
are listed as having the same timing - 5 ATDC.

thanks

Blake
