Hi,
First thing you want to do is to figure out how it was lowered, and if the 
system is safe.  Unfortunitly there are a lot of ways to lower a VW that are 
dangerous and if one of these methods was used on your bus you need to fix it 
by getting the proper lowering parts, or raising back to stock hieght.  Next 
see if the lowering is one of the bolt on types of kits or did the DPO cut 
the bus body to lower it.  If the latter you will have to sell/trade off your 
bus, due to the fact that the body probably can not be uncut.  Lastly find a 
fellow bus owner in your area with an non-lowered bus, and take some rides 
with them to see if you like it or not.  
   As to wether to raise it back up or not is a question you have to ansewer 
for yourself.  Some like the idea that they could enter the Le Mans race and 
corner well.  While others like the higher stock ride visabilty and ability 
to get over bumps and pot holes in daily driving, while not taking the 
corners at 50MPH.  Eric&amp;Barb
