Subject: RE: [VB] AridZona Full Length Bus Rack

Try Wolfsburg west for rattle cans of paint.
I have a Tom conner 8foot rack. He'll make 8foot to hold plywood, 10 or
12 ft curvy ends for huge sizes.
The accuracy to OE is close, but not money. It's stronger for one, with
thicker walled tubing. The powdercoat is strong finish, I have the shiny
primer grey, to emulate an industrial rack. I think the tube spacing is
closer for more tubes, not certain.
It is fairly difficult to get the clmaps just right, seems like the 8
foot rack has a sweet spot it attaches to the bus right, seems like the
legs want to be too close to the roof on mine, mounting it was a PITA. I
will use a garage roof and pulley to remount after painting.
Overall, I find the 8 foot I have from TOM an excellent value.
Shipping to PA was scary. It came in truck, wrapped in cardboard with
the ladder in there. Suffered no damage that I could see. We had to slap
it on right in the parking lot, no other way to get it home.
Turn around time was around 8-10 weeks, not bad for custom.
I do not know of OE racks enough to fully answer this question, only to
attest that the racks are nice and useable.

Has anyone bought a full length Tom Conner Rack or can vouch for its
accuracy to the original VW ones (the ones that used the horseshoe style
clamps). Also if you did buy one how did the shipping work out?

As well any idea where I can score a spray can (or touch up paint) or
L472- aka Beige Grey. I bought a touch up bottle of L472 from
paintscratch_dot_com and the colour id hardly even close. Their L53 (sealing
wax red) was very close but beige grey is waaay off. I should add that I
already looked through wolfsburgwest_dot_com and couldn't find L472
