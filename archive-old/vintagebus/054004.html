Subject: Re: [VB] Strangest injuries...or at least funniest!

How about the time I squeezed under my bus to work on it after 
installing my lower profile tires (the ones previous were big redneck 
tires for when the wheel wells were cut!). I forced myself under 
there and ended up getting stuck!!!!!!!

It took me a few minutes and a lot of cussing to finally get 
out...and it tore up my T-shirt and scratched up my beer belly pretty 
good...blood and everything. When I went inside my wife freaked out 
and asked what happened. When I told her...she fell on the floor 
laughing!

Needless to say, since then I've lost about 30 lbs. I'm still 
fat...but at least I don't get stuck under my bus now!
