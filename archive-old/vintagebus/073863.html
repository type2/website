Subject: Re: [VB] Brake &amp; Shift(Minor) issue??

Did you replace the flexible brake hoses? If you're saying the brakes 
don't release completely after you take your foot off the pedal it's 
probably because the flex hoses need to be replaced.

&gt; Here's the issue that I'm fairly sure is a brake thing.  I was easy it beside
&gt; the house and notice a dragging sound when going forward.  tried it several
&gt; times and it done each time in forward.  New brakes, cylinders, wheel bearings
&gt; etc...  I can adjust must the brakes most of the way off and 95% of the sound
&gt; goes away.  Question is what do I look for when I pull the wheel?  Maybe a
&gt; show dragging?  Slipped off of the retainer?  rock in the shoe?
