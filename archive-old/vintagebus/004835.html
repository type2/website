Why do I feel dirty when I have to say these words?

For Sale, Greater Vancouver area...

1966 bus, complete with skylight, bed in the back, brand spankin' new
winter tires, and much more, good condition in and out, asking $1900CDN
(make me an offer).  Bus is located in the West End of Vancouver.  I'm
going back to work for the army and need to get rid of my bus in the
next couple of weeks...either drop me some email or call me at (604)
836-8520...

Feeling nasty,

Bray
