Subject: Re: [VB] side pop outs needed

Ackkk! I guess I must have just gotten really lucky, as mine were snug as a 
bug in a rug - though I admit I didn't measure them with such accuracy!  
They work well for me, but I suppose, as always, the &quot;buyer should beware&quot; 
when it comes to purchasing anything.

Unless they threw away the jigs they had and started from scratch,
the repop popouts are nowhere near as good as the originals.  I'd
bought a pair for my '55, and found that no two corners had the
same radius, and none had the same radius as the original.  They'll
work only because the popouts are not a tight fit into the window
opening.

 &gt; As for your question, you can buy new, virgin popout frames from Wolfgang
 &gt; International.  I have bought a few from them myself, and they are every 
bit
 &gt; as good as the originals.
