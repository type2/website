HI guys need help in solving a problem need to know what to look for.
went to start up motor started to smoke a little shut it down, found out i 
had about a quart of gas in my motor. i don't drive it every day, where could 
the gas have come from I'm assuming  by gravity the gas found it way down 
fuel line but what should i check fuel pump, distributor......any suggestions
