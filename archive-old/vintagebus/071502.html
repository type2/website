Subject: Re: [VB] Bus Rims

&gt; #1) Take the rim to the tire store, have the tire removed $7.50 + Tax
&gt;
Local ghetto used tire place = $1-$2 cash
I had 4 tires removed for $5 about a month ago and the guy gave me a stack
of VW hubcaps so I came out ahead.  I also got some cool old school VW
stories from him.  ;)

&gt; #2) Leave the old tire there $3.00 recycling fee
&gt;
Huh?  Take it with you and dump it at step #3 below.

&gt; #3) Drive around dumpster diving until I find a box.
&gt; #4) Bring the thing home and pack it.
&gt; #5) Take it to UPS and ship it.
&gt;
First, go Fed Ex ground, it's cheaper.  Second, you don't need a box or any
packing.

I would say $25 each for nice, rust free rims if someone is buying them mail
order.
