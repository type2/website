Subject: Re: [VB] accel. cable cut tranny case

Ya- aren't the splitty ones 7mm or something shorter?   I think you can get 
the bug ones new for $7 or something.   But you'd take the end off, cut the 
tube, stick end back on.  Anyone made that moddy work?  I used an unmodded 
bug tube in my 65.

&lt;&lt; Splitties DID come with a Bowden tube. I have one FOR a splitty. You can
 use/mod Bug Ghia, and others and have them work. Might have to just trim
 them for total length to avoid binding.

  I am not sure  that the splitties came
 with bowden tubes, but you can use one off a bug and it makes the gas
 pedal firmer.
