Subject: Re:  Shift Rod Separation
Message-ID: &lt;5f135d1c.24772aa0_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

was writ:


Ok, what's the magic technique to separate the shift rod that's just aft
of the  front axle? I drilled out the previously-broken bolt, used a
little penetrant, a little heat and a few choice words, but the rods
won't separate.

I've also tried twisting with a pair of vise grips, that didn't work out
either.

I'm considering marking and cutting the rod in two (I need to take out
the beam) then welding it back in again. Will the rod being shortened
the width of the hacksaw blade affect the shifting after it's all welded
back up?

Just looking for feedback before I perform any half-_at__at_sed repairs on my
bus.

I advise against cutting.

Spend at least an hour alternately  heating it up with a propane torch, then 
cooling it with a squirt bottl- repeated heat/cold shock treatment does help. 
  I used to have a propane torch that got steel glowing red hot- that was the 
best.  :)    alas, it broke under the zbed when flipping it into a bed and 
the thing got caught in the mechanism... doh!
