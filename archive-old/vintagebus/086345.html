Subject: Re: [VB] light switch

 sounds like you hooked the clock light wire up to the wrong post.   It should be the same post that goes to the lights in the speedo... that dim/bright when youtwist the headlight switch.
 
Check a wiring diagram... I don't remember which terminal is which, but they are labeled an dthe wiring diagram will say how to wire it up.
 
You might also have a bad ground at the clock?  Can you loosen the knurled nuts and scrape the brackets against the underside of the dash?
 
 I can't see what the light bulb would do to interfere with the working of the clock, something is funky there.  The wire to power the clock should be always on, and have nothing to do with the headlight switch.

Can someone help me? The light that goes to the clock stays on all the time, 
which makes the clock not work. When I pull the light switch out to turn on the 
head lights , the light goes off. It should be the other way around. I put a 
different switch in, but it does the same thing. thanks,Bob
