&gt; Anybody make sense out of that?

Hi Woody,
Yes!  The clutch generally has three positions.  Too loose and the clutch 
will not release or fail to release fully which the latter will cause clutch 
disc/pressure plate and even syncro failure all too soon.  Just right adjustment 
works, well just right.  Too tight and the clutch will slip or not engage at 
all because as far as the clutch is concerned you might as well have the clutch 
pedal partially or fully depressed all the time.
  Kind of like Goldie Locks and the Three Bears....
