Subject: crank pulley suggestions

Lots of info in the archives about this, but I wanted to get some up
to date info. I can't stand my aluminum crank pulley. Not because of
it being al, but cheap and based on the fan belt hop not exactly a
perfect belt groove. Assuming the only conditions I want is a good
balanced pulley with etched (not screened) degree numbers who's is the
best buy currently? Steel or Al doesn't matter. This is just on my
stock 1600, so no extreme rpms expected either. TIA
