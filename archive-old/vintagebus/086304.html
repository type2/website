Subject: Re: [VB] summer is here!!

The temps are fine, the engine had unknown miles on it when he got the truck 
years ago....  seems like time to think about a rebuild/replacement.
 
I did notice the oil light came on a little a couple weeks ago when I drove the 63 SC over to the Santa Cruz mountains to take a hike in the redwoods.  
The oil temps remained always below 200F, but at idle after driving back over the hill, the light did flicker.  
20/50 wt I think

I guess  that I already know that the 40 horse will need replacing sometime 
soon, buit  it makes no nasty noises and runs like clockwork.

Hi Sam,
What oil temp are you running?  Could be too high and thinning it too  much.  
BTDT!
