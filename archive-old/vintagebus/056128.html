&gt; &gt; Also, if you make the flange so that the seam is &quot;inside&quot; the bus, dirt
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; such wouldn't be a problem. &gt;
&gt;
&gt; Well, when I opened my rusty rockers that did not have any holes through
to
&gt; the outside I took out large chunks of dirt in the shape of the
&gt; rocker...could have just been my bus that someone off road'ed. I still
have
&gt; a chunk sitting on my garage wall.
&gt;

OK, but I still don't know how dirt got &quot;inside&quot; the bus. Are there any
inner rockers or cargo floors on this bus? Was the PO off-roading with the
cargo doors open?

&gt; &gt;When I do a lap weld, I weld the seam inside the
&gt; &gt; bus as well as the outer seam.
&gt;
&gt; Wow, that is a neat trick for an outside rocker?  How do you get to the
&gt; inside (top part of the lap) when you are welding an outside rocker?

There is plenty of room to get to the inside lap. All you have to do is cut
the rocker high enough so that the inside lap is higher than the top edge of
the inner rocker. I also fiberglass the lap on the inside of the bus. BTW,
I'm working on crew cab, not a bus. I don't guess that makes a difference,
does it?

&gt; But, why do the extra
&gt; welding, when if you do small spot welds (ala http://www.metwiz_dot_com) you
&gt; can easily do a but weld? Granted,more time involved in fitting, clamping,
&gt; triming though.

I did lap welds because I can use a higher setting on my welder and get
better penetration. When you butt weld thin metal, you have to cut the
voltage way down and it takes more time to stitch such a long run. The outer
lap also leaves a small gutter that I use to make my transition to the
existing panel using filler.
