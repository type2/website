I took a quick trip from my home in SoCal to Carson City NV.  It's a 400
mile (each way) journey up the 14 freeway to US395.  I was driving my '71
and carrying a Honda XR600 dirt bike, tools, spares, etc, for a load of
about 600 pounds or so, excluding me.

due to work committments, I didn't leave until 4:00PM, so I climbed the
pass out of LA at a temperature of 113F,  Hit a big traffic jam before
Palmdale, so I hopped off to get a tank of gas.  By the time I filled up,
the clog had gone so I could proceed to the Antelope Valley.

The trip through the Antelope Valley was hot but uneventful as I passed
through Red Rock Canyon and on into the Owens Valley.  It was getting dark
as I stopped for gas in Bishop.

As I restarted the engine after filling up, I was shocked to see the red
generator light staring at me.  I shut down and checked the belt, which
was fine. I wiggled connections and pushed on the brushes to no avail.  I
revved the engine and the light went out.  Counting myself lucky, I headed
north into the Sierras.

There are four passes between Bishop and Nevada, all around 7000-8000
feet.  The bus climbs these long grades at 37MPH (actual) in 3rd gear.  I
was a bit nervous about meeting up with deer on the road after dark and
sure enough I saw several just before I got to Mammoth Junction.  They
were standing on the right shoulder and in the fast lane of the highway as
I whizzed past.  Remembering Nikki's encounter, I backed off to about
50MPH and peered ahead into the gloom.

Everything went swimmingly until I was about 5 miles south of Walker,
where the generator light came on again brightly and permenently.  The
headlights were getting mighty dim, but I managed to nurse the battery to
Walker (and a telephone) by utilizing the freshly-painted lines and the
full moon when there was no oncoming traffic.

There was no sense in continuing in the dark, so I phoned my Dad (about 60
miles up the road) and asked him to bring a fresh battery down the next
morning.  Since the motels of Walker were all displaying signs that said
&quot;Sorry&quot; or just &quot;NO&quot;, I stretched out on the back seat and called it a
night.

Morning came very early as my father tooted his horn just as the eastern
horizon was lightening.  I installed his spare battery in the light of his
headlights and shared a cup of coffee until it was light enough to
proceed.  The rest of the trip to Carson City was uneventful.

We were committed to work on the Pony Express Reenactment, so the bus had
to sit for a day and wait for repairs.  I put a plea to the lists for
information on how to troubleshoot the charging system.

the trip out to Eureka and back was uneventful, but since I didn't take
the bus it isn't really on topic.  Suffice to say that I did a lot more
driving than sleeping, especially considering that we had to be on site
way out in the boonies at 3:00AM!

We returned to Carson City and I found several helpful messages waiting
for me (thanks, volks!)  I disconnected the generator and checked the
output voltage with the field grounded and discovered no output.  Darn,
looks like I will have to pull the the generator!  One thing left to do
was to pull the brushes.  The top brush was OK, but the bottom brush was
trashed.  Apparently, somewhere along the line the top brush was replaced
without replacing the bottom one!  Not a good thing!  Thank goodness I
could change the brushes with the generator in place!

Luckily the local NAPA flaps had the brushes in stock, so it was a matter
of popping them in (the bottom one has to go in by Braille!) and firing it
up.  Light was out, problem fixed!

I hooked up my digital voltmeter for the trip back, and it kept me
entertained for 400 miles.  The voltage started out at 14.1, but then
dropped to 13.0  It then fluctuated between 12.7 and 13.8 volts, spending
a minute or more at each value.  This seems to be normal operation, but
still caused me some concern due to the fluctuation.

The ride down from the sierras is much easier than that going up, although
there are a few climbs to the passes going southward.  I left in the cool
of the morning which meant that they only weather I had to contend with
was stiff crosswinds in the Antelope Valley.  I arrived home at about
4:30PM.

Bus sightings along the way:

In Dayton NV, there is a '71 at a used car lot.  White over Orange deluxe
station wagon.  Middle seat is there.  Dented front and rear but didn't
see any rust.  Price was around 1500.

In Carson City NV, Highway 50 East, next to the NAPA store was a bay
singlecab.  rusted rockers.  Doesn't look like it's run in a long time.
gates looked OK.

In Topaz, just south of the state line there was a nice red Thing (not a
bus, but kind of cool).  Looked to be in good shape, but the price was
$5000 (wow!)

That's all the news that fits!  Thanks again to the listees who helped me
sort out my electricals!

Remember folks, check those brushes, and if the top of the brush is below
the top of the holder it's time to replace 'em!  Check both brushes!
