Subject: Re: [VB] somebody stop me

Concur!  My trailer was more like $2500 including the electric brake 
set up for my truck, tiedowns, and a winch.  I have probably only 
used it 10 times or so thus far, but I also consider it money well 
spent.

Unfortunately, the City has decided that I am not allowed to store my 
trailer (and assorted busses) on my vacant lot, so now I have to find 
a warehouse or something!  (The humorous part of the story is that 
the City wanted to rent my lot for City storage while downtown 
sidewalks were being repaired!)

&gt;&gt;You know your buying too many buses when you start adding up how many times
&gt;&gt;you've rented a tow dolly.

&gt;That's exactly why I just put up the cash for a trailer. I got a NEW 
&gt;16 ft. double axle trailer with ramps for around $850.00. Funny 
&gt;thing is used ones don't sell for much cheaper than that around 
&gt;here. Made sense for me and much safer. I've gotten way more than my 
&gt;money back on it. I use it all the time for stuff other than hauling 
&gt;VW's. I help friends retrieve VW's as well. Even towed my brothers 
&gt;'55 Ch*vy 2-door home on it. Money well spent.
