Thanks Eric and Barb!!
Correct on all counts!
Could you also tell me what I'm going to have for breakfast tomorrow !!

    Well I've begun wiring the '60 Westy.The only color schematic I had was a
wrinklie
somewhat faded 62 schematic.So I strolled over to the local printers and had
them
enlarge and laminate the old p.o.s.Now I have a beatiful and clear 16&quot; x 11&quot;
plastic coated color
schematic.Funny how almost every bus I've owned, p.o's have cut and hacked the
wiring harnesses.
Wire works might just get 400 bucks out of me again.

                    woody

ps. i'm too stupid to figure out how to print the schematics off the web.

&gt; &lt;&lt; I am trying to rebuild the speedo out of my 61 westy.However the needle
&gt;  (indicating your speed)is trashed.Can anyone sell me a decent needle or
&gt; should I try finding another speedo? Speedo is dated 6/60 and is an eighty
&gt; mile/hour speedo. &gt;&gt;
&gt; Hi Woody,
&gt; VDO Shops should have this needle.  Since we just Pmailed you about our
&gt; noticing that your 1961 westie is actually a very late 1960 instead.  Your
&gt; needle should be of the clear plastic type that was replaced in the 1961
&gt; model year by the all white plastic needle use on up through 1967.  By now
&gt; any used clear needle will be yellowed and most likely brittle thusly ready
&gt; to break at anytime.
&gt;    There is Hollywood speedo in L.A. Cal., and in Portland Ore. there is
&gt; another VDO shop.  Eric&amp;Barb
