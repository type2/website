Hi Steve,
Yes, it is normal for any oil getting by the axle seals to drip out the inner 
side (Axle side.) of the backing plates.  The drainage system from the axle 
seals is designed to do this and not allow oil drips/seeps to coat up the 
rear brake shoes.
   However it is not normal for the axle seal/s to leak or even seep enough 
to show up in the faintest amounts on the inside of the backing plate unless 
there is a problem with the axle seal/s or the bore/s they were pressed into 
or perhaps the spacer/s that spins while sealed to the inner lip of the axle 
seal/s or perhaps the O-ring that seals this spacer to the lower stub axle 
itself or the two sealing surfaces there are scratched/rusted/worn.
  You really can not overfill the RGBs since they are topped off when you 
fill the tranny center section and if you do have a RGB leak about 1/4-1/3 of 
the top of the oil in the tranny center section will self drain into the 
leaky RGB to keep it topped off.  Which seems to be a design asset to help 
prevent the outer axle bearing/s in the type 1,2, and 3 from running dry 
before you have a chance to notice the axle leak/seep.  This works well 
unless it is a catastrosphic sudden leak or the driver is oblivious to taking 
a quick walk around thier VW to look for wetness from oil or brake fluid 
showing up on the rims in dry weather.    Eric&amp;Barb
