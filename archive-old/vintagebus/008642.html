Subject: Prescott AZ cruise?
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

To anyone interested:
Everett and I (and possibly a few other buses) will be departing the Home
Depot parking lot on I-17  (the usuall 'Jerome cruise' starting point) at
approx 8 am this saturday morning. Anyone who wishes to join the cruise is
welcome. The plan is to head up to a camping spot to meet up with Ronnie and
a few other Havasu crewers at a camping ground in Prescott which will be
'homebase' until the show on sunday.
Mail me if you know your comin to cruise with us, hope to see you there
-Wade
