Hi Volks,
Generator idiot light works the same, by the regulator grounding the wire 
from the light when the fan belt breaks or some other reason the generator is not 
turning or producing enough electricity.  The grounding wires from these two 
lights are seperate so finding one wire problem is not going to solve both 
problems!  Chiltons and Haynes manuals are not very good and have mistakes in 
them that are not at all good for the engine.  Idiot's manual by John Muir is 
great for explaining the basics to the beginner, and the VW Transporter shop 
manual is the ultimate for best and most info.
