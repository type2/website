Subject: RE: [T2] Best way to pay for a bus if you can't collect in 
  person ?

Hi there:

Just as Greg has pointed out on an earlier post, as I read this reply, this
whole thing looks like a scam.  Please look at the link below.  How did the
buyer come to find your bus anyway?  Is he/they offering more money via
check/money order than you want for the bus and then you send the difference
back?

If this is the case, you will end up loosing a bus (if you ship it) and
money.

There are a lot of websites with this type of info, just passing along just
this one.

&gt; Dear folks,
&gt;
&gt; I'm hoping to go through with a US-UK bus transaction and wondered if 
&gt; anyone has any good advice as to the best way to arrange payment so 
&gt; that the seller is happy and so am I.  I've looked at Escrow and that 
&gt; seems to be the best way, but to be honest if the seller hasn't heard 
&gt; of Escrow then its reputation is kind of zero by default (I know it's 
&gt; not really).  Any other suggestions ?

Lee,

As I have called the seller and assured him you are a straight-up guy, and
have offered to stand as a compurgator, I would be happy to send Victor
whatever the sum you have arrived at and collect from you.  Basically act as
an escrow account between you two with the type2 list as witness.
Because of my personal finances, the check will not be sent to Victor until
next Monday (8/28, my next payday).  I don't figure I would get your cheque
from England and change the spelling to check before that, anyway.
If you want it sent sooner, I am willing if you are willing to include an
extra $25 to cover the overdraft fee from my bank.  If so, I can send it
tomorrow.

In addition, since I am local to the bus and Baltimore (the probable best
port of departure) is ~50 miles up the road, I am very willing to drive the
bus (hey, Barry, are you listening, 'cuz I am probably gonna bring you in on
this deal :) to the port to save you the towing charge to the port.

All that having been said, I have NO experience with shipping a bus
overseas.  Marcus Schaper (you ARE paying attention to this thread, are you
not, Marcus?) has done this before and probably can recommend a good
shipping agent.

&gt; The only reasons I'm not going to collect myself is 1) cost of flight 
&gt; and of course 2) minimizing the number of times I leave the ground in 
&gt; my life : )

Yeah, yeah... and miss out on the opportunity to visit with me and my cats
and have me show you the slave pens of Alexandria Virginia (Y'all have heard
the phrase &quot;Sold south&quot;.... did you ever wonder &quot;From WHERE?&quot;) and show you
the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and
one of the few copies of the Magna Carta that was not seized when Richard
got the boot :-)

Seriously, the bus will have to go by ship, so there is no sense in coming
over to collect it personally.  I can deliver it to the port, if that is a
savings or work with the agent to get it to you.  But I do offer a bed to
anyone who is in the DC area (advance notice REQUIRED!) and a tour to anyone
who wishes to know *all* of the local history :-)
