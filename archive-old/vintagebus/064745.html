Subject: Re: [VB] new bus won't start

Ya, I'd clean the battery ground, the connections on the battery, and the 
connections to the starter.   When you take that big wire from the battery 
off the starter, have the ground to the battery disconnected.   Make all 
connections shiny clean and use dielectric grease when reattaching to keep 
the corrosion down.  

If that doesn't work, I'd start on the connections up front. cause the 
electricity comes from the battery pops over to the bolt on the starter, then 
a wire up from to the right most fuse, up to the headlight switch, from 
headlight switch to ig switch, then a wire back to the starter push on 
connection.  Any corrosion o loose connections add up to lost power, andthe 
starter needs a lot to get the motor spinning enough.   

One thing you can try is crossing the starter terminal with a screwdriver 
(from the big hot on the bolt to the push on connection.   That bypasses the 
wires and switch up front, and should make the starter spin ever if there are 
some bad connections up front.   Please make sure the brake is on and the bus 
is out of gear when you do this.

 If it trys to turn and kinda makes a little &quot;whump-whump&quot; sound then nothing,
 could be a bad ground. Double check that the tranny ground strap is there and
 connected correctly.
