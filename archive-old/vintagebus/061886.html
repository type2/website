Subject: Re: [VB] accel. cable cut tranny case

FWIW the accel cable setup on my 67 DC came with a piece of plastic
sheathing that goes from the end of the cable's metal tube at the
transmission, to the end of the through-the-fan-shroud tube where it
pokes forward through the firewall.  The sheathing is just the right
diameter to fit over each metal tube perfectly.  I improved it by
clamping each end to the metal so it wouldn't slide off all the time.

&gt; i notice when i pulled my engine that my accelerator cable is slowly slicing
&gt; through the tranny case. has anyone else ever had this happen? any
&gt; suggestions of remedies...i was thinking of sliding some fuel line over it,
&gt; but i dont know it that will jam up or maybe not last very long. the slice
&gt; in the tranny is pretty bad, at least 1/8&quot;.
