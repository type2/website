Jose writ:
&gt;We have a 67' bus that the heat does not work in. The engine is pulled and
i want to know if i can remove the heater boxes without messing anything
else up. Or do I have to keep them, i was thinking about putting J pipes. I
noticed if i do this we loose the bottom cover of sheet metal. Should i just
leave the heater boxes on? &lt;


If you are not running the stock thermostat and flaps there should be little
problem switching to the J-pipes.  Also a concern maybe that without the
lower tinware &quot;junk&quot; can fly up under the engine and potentially dent the
pushrod tubes which would be very bad.

Might be safer just leaving the heat exchangers in place.   There should be
no performance difference between them either.
