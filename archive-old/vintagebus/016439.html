I recently replaced all the panels in my 67.  The overhead panels were a 
total PITA.  I am fairly adept at woodworking and still had a very difficult 
time.  I never did find a piece large enough to do the poptop area. I 
eventually had to use two pieces of paneling with the wrong side up to get 
it finished.  My grain on the long piece is wrong.  For all the hassle, 600 
doesn't sound that bad.  I will probably redo mine sometime and when I do I 
will use their pieces.

On another quick note, does anyone know if the curtain hold back string is 
elastic or just cord?
