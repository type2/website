Subject: RE: [VB] Re: cargo door woes on 65' bus/new bus

From what I have seen there are 2 different ways the bars are held in place
it the doors. On high hindge doors there is a spring bar (like a brakes
adjuster screw holder) that holds the bar against a square bracket that
guides it. The spring may be bent or broken in the door not letting it go
through. The later doors I can't say how they are guided as I have never cut
one apart to see, but they are easier to put the rods in.

Ya, you just gotta get them aligned properly.  It's a funny angle, they
don't 
go all the way over to the side.    I try to avoid removing the rods unless 
absolutely neccessary.  Tie the upper bars in place with wire if you have to

replace the mechanism.

Funny thing is I just acquired a new bus- 65 american camper, not sure what 
brand.  For some unknown reason the check rods and mechanism of the rear 
cargo door are gone.  And the mechanism for the front cargo door does not 
retract the lower rod.  So the thing is, I have some check rods, but I'll 
have to figure out which is which.  joy!
