Subject: Wiring an 8 track
Message-ID: &lt;371D5848.A4ED506C_at_escape_dot_ca&gt;

Hey list

So i picked up an 8 track player and a big box of 8-track tapes for
$3.00.  Seems to work great, and it sure has more power than the ol'
cassette deck.  Anyway.

I have 6 wires for speakers blue, purple, white, grey, brown, green.  I
have the speakers all wired but there is something definitely wrong.
The fad and balance are not wired correctly.  Does anyone know of a web
site or anything for figuring out car stereo wiring.

Thanks again
