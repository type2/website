In a message dated 98-09-15 12:16:02 EDT, you write:

&lt;&lt; if you use a bug tranny, you need to get the tranny out of the swing axle
bug,
 and pull the axles off it, the ring gear needs to be turned the other way, or
 you will have 4 reverse and one forward gear.   things need shimming in there
 with the cover plates. put your reduction boxes on it, and install.    &gt;&gt;
Hi Clara,
The problem with using a stock pre-1969 swing axle bug tranny is it has a .89
fourth gear.  The bus and K. Ghia used a .82 fourth.  Using the bug tranny .89
in a reduction gear bus will result in a loss of 5 MPH and you thought that
stock trannyed buses were slow to begin with.    Eric &amp; Barb
