Since you're willing to travel, check out the classifieds at VW Planet: 
both at http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/classifieds/ and at
http://thesamba_dot_com/vw/links/linksforsale.htm.  You'll find more Type 2s
for sale than Carter has little liver pills (am I dating myself?).  Many
of the ads come with pictures, such as this one from Arizona:

&gt; Well the time has come for me to buy a splittie.
&gt; I sold my 1970 semi restored westy over the weekend so
&gt; I am in the market for a pre 67. I would prefer a camper but I am open to
&gt; anything including a crewcab. I am located in Delaware (East Coast)
&gt; but I am willing to travel across country for the right bus. I would like it
&gt; to be
&gt; as solid as possible. Not real interested in a project right now. My budget
&gt; is in the
&gt; 4-6k range. Please help me I am having type 2 withdrawal.
