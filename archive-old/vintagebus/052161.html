Subject: tipper speed limit was: Just how fast does your bus go??

Actually, the red line is at 50 km/h!  But the m code plate doesn't specify
anything unusual unless the '065: Inscribed axle load limits' is this...????

really???   What are the m-codes?  did it get delived w/special gears?

I saw a DD slider 21 window factory orange with mountain gears and limited
slip.  It was ordered as an airport luggage van.  LOADS of m codes

I wrote&gt;&gt; My 67 tipper has a red line on the speedo at ~55km/h (!)
 I haven't had it past 40km/h yet :-) &gt;&gt;
