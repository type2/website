:  &gt;This is by way of a &quot;heads up&quot;, at least for folks in the US Pacific
:  &gt;Northwest.

I've had similar experiences the last tank or two from Conoco in
Colorado, but only when the engine's cold.  As a guess, they're
dealing with some of the effects of the gas pricing problem by
lowering how much actual fuel-per-gallon is being sold (&lt;insert
favorite oil company conspiracy theory here&gt;), which lowers the
effective octane rating.  It's probably officially still at the rated
level, due to the fact that what's printed on the pump is an average
of two different ratings (can't remember what the two measures are at
the moment, but the printed number is the average of the two).

I'm starting to get low, and will be doing a moderate amount of
mountain driving over the weekend.  Maybe I should go for the higher
octane, as an experiment.  Pity it's the high-price weekend....
