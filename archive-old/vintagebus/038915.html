I have finanly located a trans, full rear suspension, and the redux boxes
for my 66. I was even lucky to get one that
was from another 12v 66. The yard claims it's tunrkey, and I just might take
the risk. If I deciede not to, and/or for
future repairs, I am going to need to be able to disassemble the boxes to
remove the axle tubes for trans replacement,
also since I am considering freeway flier.
Where can i get a 241a or similiar substitute to pull the upper bearing to
get the axles off?
What other specialty tools should I consider to at least be able to get the
axles on and off? Any recommendation on size/brand circlip pleirs?

The yard claims this bus sat 15 years inside in CA, and now sat two years
outside in PA. What are my chances that the
redux boxes and trans really are good?

Closer to stock...
