Subject: Bring Your Own Bus '02, April 6th!

Hey everyone,
BYOB'02 is a go on all levels! Join us Saturday April 6th at the Red Barn
in Acomas, CA (45 mi south of San Jose) for another day of early bus
enjoyment! Strictly Vintage 2s is working to expand the show and swap
area because we're expecting a larger turnout this year! If you were
there last year, you recall the awesome raffles, great swaps, and
entertaining show awards! Tell a friend, tell a few, and bring out all
your buses to the Red Barn! Camping Friday night (gates close promptly at
midnight), the place opens up at 8am Saturday with festivities running
until 1pm (gives you plenty of time to prep for Kelley Park Sunday). Swap
is $10 per spot, admission is only $1 per person, and the show fee is
still free, but limited to pre-1968 buses. Internet flyers are available
at http://www.redshift_dot_com/~taylorvw/svt and all questions can be emailed
to me at taylorvw_at_redshift_dot_com.
Hope to see lots of you there!
-Taylor
