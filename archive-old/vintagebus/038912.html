Raymond,
	There are a few ways to lower a bus. None of them is ultimately better than
truely stock in mymopinion, but there are two that provide lower engine rpms
(up to you if this is good) ,lower towing and hauling capablilty, higher gas
mileage and top speed. This is lowered spindles to retian stock suspension
geometery in the front, or an adjustabkle beam, which some consider to be
harsher. Removing or modifying the torsion leaves in the tubes up front is
another not so good way to do it.
IN the rear, you may have swing axle or IRS. IRS usually requires welding
and modifying the body, but I have heard there are some ways not to do this,
I don't know. Some say that the axles of the CVS are not very great with a
split IRS, but I do not own one, although the angle did seem severe on the
couple examples I had seem. Perhaps they had adjustible spring plates set up
to a stock front.
Placing the standard redux boxes down by altering the spring plate to body
angle is also used, with drastic changes to wheel attitude (as moving any
swing axle sto places they were meant only to rarely visit will do) is also
a way of moving the rear down, with suspension changes, to put it mildly.
	My bus came lowered with te swing axles and lowered spindles. The top speed
and RPM range was acceptable, but since i wanted group clearance and torque,
I am going back to stock. If you have lowered spindles, and a TYPE III swing
(no redux) or IRS rear you may enjoy a decent ride with good mileage as
well. Look to see if you have very high spindles in relation to the upper
torsion arms, and see if you have redux boxes or not, or even dual jointed
axles to tell..

Subject: [VB] 21 Window - questioning lowering method



I am the one who bought the OTHER yellow 21 window that we saw on Ebay a
month back. My wife christened her Lucy. I am very happy with her so far
(both her and Lucy). No real rust and original straight metal.
Lucy is lowered, but I have never lowered a bus. Due to its ride I expect
that springs were cut. Looking under the bus, what is the best way to tell
lowering method? I would like dropped spindles to restore ride (tell me if
this doesn’t work). Anyone know of a good VW mechanics near Charlotte, NC?

Excited to be on list!
