&gt;Had a Pertronix go out a couple of months after I installed it.  It didn't
&gt;go totally out, but would cut out.  I have another Pertronix running a
&gt;couple of years later in a different car.
&gt;The advice of carrying points/or spare distributor is good.  Or maybe a
&gt;spare pertronix.
======================================

When the local guru found out I bought and installed a pertronix, his
immediate response was, &quot;What are you gonna do when it quits on you?  Stand
around and wait for another one to be shipped to you?&quot;  His point was the
same - carry a set of points and make sure you know how to install them so
when the pertronix cuts finally goes out (he said around 30,000 miles), you
can get it fixed and be on your way - or carry another pertronix I guess.  I
still like it though - smooth running engine and no more high speed miss.
