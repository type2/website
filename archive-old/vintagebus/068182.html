Subject: Re: [VB] 12 volt BN4 heater 

Looks like a '68 and later heater. It will still work just fine. The tell tale sign is the base that mounts to the bus. On an early heater, the base mounts in the engine compartment via two rubber encased bolts. Late model heaters have a shorter base that still has the 2 rubber &quot;bolts&quot; but they are attached to a special &quot;holder&quot; that fits in a bay window bus in order to accomodate the bay window engine compartment sheet metal configuration.

Light travels faster than sound. 
This is why some people appear bright until you hear them 
speak.
