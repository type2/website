   Off with the valve cover, the rocker was held on
&gt; with bolts not nuts (?)

That's an old &quot;short stud&quot; kit. Muir mentions it in his book. Before
the kit was installed the head had rocker arm studs that passed though
where the stud usually mounts and then into the head inboard of where
the valves are. I think there's a drawing in Muir that's a lot less
confusing than my explanation.

&gt; The crank falls out in 3, count them, three pieces.  Cool.   I have heard of
&gt; broken cranks before, but not seen one.   Three pieces.  I am a bit impressed.

That *is* impressive. I had a crank break two miles from home and I
decided to limp in with it. It was almost worth the price of the
rebuild to see the looks on peoples faces as I drove by 8^). Man, that
was a noisy ride.
