&gt; Option #3:  Have rebuilt spindles shipped ahead of me to the location of 
&gt; the
&gt; bus and put them on there.  (Sounds most sane)

Hi Gene,
Definitely go that way.

&gt; Question:  Is it a common occurance that kingpins wear to the point of
&gt; breaking, thus lowering the bus, but not in a kewl way?

It could happen, but more likely it will be a problem of having the steering 
pointing your bus where it will, not where you want!

&gt; Another question:  How much time does it take to replace spindles and set 
&gt; them
&gt; up properly?

Taking your time it should be about 4 hours.  Figure at least another 12 
hours for going through the suspension, electrical, brakes, steering, tranny, &amp; 
lastly the engine.
