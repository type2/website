 Note, it IS IMPORTANT to run the
&gt; correct heat range.  A plug that runs too hot will cause pre-ignition which
&gt; leads to detonation, (there's a difference between the two), which will not
&gt; be a good thing for your engine.  It is the temperature of the plug that
&gt; causes the problem.  Not the construction of the electrode.
&gt; goforit!

Huh.  That is the first I had ever heard that. At my shop they have been
using the w8ac's on alll uprights as long as I have been there. The
dogma we spout is that they are the hottest available for that series.

How could a hotter plug cause pre-ignition, since it still doesn't spark
until (assuming it is timed right) the proper instant at the end of the
compression stroke?
