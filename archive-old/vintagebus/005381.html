list :
i went under the late bus today to see why or if
the front suspension would fit under the splittie.
the beams have the same frame spacing. the
mounting bolt holes are different, so be it.
 the beams are spaced differently bigger on the
late bus, but there is more room above the
splittie beam to push it up there, with the
possibility of adjusting the shock mount, and
some consideration to the sway bar.
the brakes don't interfere, i don't know if the
pitman arm fits, and if there will be a shifter
conflict.
i am beginning to suspect this could happen.
i actually wouldn't mind keeping the kingpins if
disc brakes could be had, but i suspect this is
what the aftermarket kits might be offering, i haven't
checked yet.
my personal preference would be to slam the front,
from the standpoint of lowered center of gravity
and the inherent increase in stability of roadhandling,
and would prefer to achieve this with the late bus
suspension, insofar as my plan is to do the rear also,
need to match the wheels,a topic for the next e-mail.

there must be others on this list who have investigated
the possibilities, and some who have achieved it.
and quite possibly there could be several others who
would like this modification. the suspension is not
exposed, there is no conspicuous hack to the exterior,
 and the inherent improvement in driveability
would be an asset for a common garden variety microbus.
does anybody have any info on this modification?
