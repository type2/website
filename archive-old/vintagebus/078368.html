&gt;Find out what anperage the fuse is for the wipers then go to Radio Shack.

Ah, Rat Shock.  &quot;You've got questions, we make up the answers.&quot;  Years
ago they would have been able to help you with this.  Now they just want
to push phones and TV sets; it's rare to find a Rat Shock clerk that
knows much about component electronics.  Plus, they don't sell any
rheostats that would handle the power required for a VW wiper motor.
They do have a few fixed resistors that you might be able to make work,
but again, the clerk isn't going to know how to help you.

&gt;They should be able to figure out how much power the rheostat needs to
&gt;be able to handle, and what the value of restistance will be needed to
&gt;drop 13.2V to 7.6V.

Shirley you mean 6.6 V?

&gt;Or, if I remember my power calculations, P (in watts) = I (current
&gt;&lt;amperage&gt;) times E (Voltage)
&gt;Hence, Power capacity of the rheostat = (Fuse size) times 6

Right.  You might multiply by 6.6 V or even 7 V to be conservative.  On
my '64, the wiper is on an 8 A fuse, so you'd come up with something
between 48 W and 56 W.  To be frugal, you could find the current or power
required by just the wiper motor (hint: the power rating is in the
'63-'67 Bentley) and size the rheostat to that.

&gt;Then is it E=IsquaredR  Voltage = Current squared times resistance

No, P = I^2 * R, power = current squared times resistance.  Solving for
R, R = P / I^2, resistance = power divided by voltage squared.  Taking
the 6.6 V example above, we'd have P = 52.8 W and I = 8 A, so we'd come
up with 52.8 / 64 or 0.825 ohms.

The only problem with this is that the wiper motor doesn't draw 50 W.
It draws around half of that, so the 0.825 ohm resistor will be too small -
it won't drop enough voltage.  It will slow the wipers down, but not down
to their original 6 V speed.  If you assume that the wiper motor draws
4 A or 26.4 W, you come up with a power rating of 24 W to 28 W, and (at
6.6 V) a resistance of 26.4 / 16 or 1.65 ohms.

&gt;Note that this would be for a simple voltage drop resistor but this
&gt;should get you in the ballpark for the resistance and wattage of the
&gt;rheostat.

Right.  To buy a fixed resistor you have to get closer to right; if you
have a rheostat you can cover up your sins with a slight turn of the shaft.
:)  It's also good to think about the extreme cases...  on one hand, you've
just cranked a balky engine to get it to start, you're idling with the
brake lights, turn signals, dome light, and radio, and wipers on (low
system voltage), and the snow is thick and heavy (high load)... on the
other hand, you've been driving for an hour on the Interstate in the
daytime with everything shut off (high system voltage) and it starts
raining Peruvian snail snot (low load).

&gt;Any electrical engineers feel free to blow away 9th grade electricity
&gt;class all you want, I'd be curious to see if I remembered right.

I am not an electrical engineer.  I started out to be one but then I
wimped out and went into Comp Sci instead.  However, four tries out
of five, I can pick up the right end of a soldering iron...
