Subject: RE: [VB] Should I Cut Up A Bus?

  If you need the parts CUT IT. I did the same to a very straight 59 panel.
I needed a good nose clip and early doglegs. None of which I could find at a
reasonable price. I now have a beautiful nose, nice doglegs and some other
OG sheet metal that I needed for my Westy's, much more importaant to me then
a plain ol panel. Another plus is that some of the parts will eventually go
to the repair of a 55 BD and a 56 Safari bus. So 1 cut up bus is saving 4
others. 
  I did get a lot of shit when I cut up my 55 BD Deluxe and sold the 55 BD
panel. Most of the VN's said I should have sacrificed a perfect restoreable
BD panel to save the Deluxe of which I would of had to swap chassis on!!
  I have seen the Captain America bus and would love to see it refurbished,
but your needs and those of your other buses should come first. 
  I have seen some very clean kombis cut to pieces for a couple pieces of
sheet metal to save Deluxes ( a waste in my opinion), but the people doing
it make a lot more money on a pieced together Deluxe then they would of on a
nice dry Kombi!

ronnie  it's your stuff do what you need to do

Subject: [VB] Should I Cut Up A Bus?



i'll start off with the busses i have that need sheetmetal: 59 westy- needs 
doglegs, nose, rear corner (left). 58 westy- needs doglegs, right rear
corner, 
misc here and there.

i have a 62 DD panel (fat doglegs, flat wheel wells) that is, with the 
exception of the left rear corner and side up to the cargo doors, very very 
clean original metal, rust free and very very straight. it is also in stock,

unmutilated condition, with about 95% of parts but missing an engine and a
few 
other very minor pieces. the left side i spent a week replacing the damaged 
sheetmetal, but it still needs finish work to be done and nice.

so here's the dilemma: i have other, earlier busses that i like more 
and am more motivated to fix. i need sheetmetal that the panel, if cut up,
would 
provide, as well as providing other sheetmetal (floors, doors, frame, belly 
pans, etc) and mechanical parts for other people who could use it. the 
nose, right corner, and doglegs on the 62 are really near perfect--no rust, 
no dents or damage of any kind, and the nose has early style headlight
buckets 
which would be correct for the earlier busses i own. i need doglegs, and the

panel has 2 perfect early style ones. 

do i cut up the panel and have people be mad at me for destroying a 
perfectly restorable, very solid, clean, (not including paint) original bus,
so 
that my (and others') projects can be furthered along? do i try to sell it
and 
probably lose money because people don't want a total project, painted like
the 
american flag, for like $1300 and then have to spend an eternity looking for

sheetmetal i need that, in all probability, won't be nearly as nice as what
i 
have from the panel? plus rachel wants it for a future &quot;fantasy&quot; project (a 
Yuengling Beer logo'd panel), which in essence means i get to do all the
work i 
don't want to do myself to it anyway in the future.

my problem with cutting up the panel would be that i have at least a grand 
into it as it sits, in need of total mechanical restoration and external 
beautification. i have alot of time, money and effort into it and it still
needs 
alot more time, effort, and money thrown at it. it does have some
sentimental 
value (which is waning) as it was the first bus i saw in a new mexico
junkyard 
that i questioned as to why it wasn't being fixed because it was so straight
and 
rust-free, and i spent alot of years trying to get it. i don't really feel
like 
investing the time or money into it, because i have other busses that are
more 
interesting to me that i'd rather fix and get running first. i don't have a
real 
need or desire to add a panel to my fleet, i like 3 window (down the side) 
busses best.

the good part would be i get clean sheet metal, and so do others, as well 
as any extra mechanical parts i don't need from it.

another part of the dilemma is space in the back yard and yet another dead 
vehicle to deal with in the future. i could use the room desperately. my
other 
busses could use the metal desperately. i don't need another project after
the 3 
i have now. there are a few other mitigating circumstances as to why i want
to 
do something soon that i won't go into, but it has nothing to do with 
complaining neighbors.

so, i am looking for some kind of mental direction/influence. i don't know 
if the plusses of cutting it up outweigh the drawbacks. just remember it is
MY 
bus, with a title in MY name, and any decision I make is MINE. plus who
knows, 
maybe YOU need a pair of nice low hinge panel cargo doors and flat rear
wheel 
wells!

input? comments (besides i'm a jerk for even considering cutting up a clean 
bus)? thoughts?

thanks

jon
