Aloha out there all you dementubus and dementites.

Wined up your baygen keyboards it's time for another one rides the bus,

But what motor does it have ?

Our hero stumbled across a 40 horse engine in a friend's back yard bus
junk pile. 
He scored that pup for a cool $50. A month or so later brought it home
and up on the desk right beside his Strong exhaustive concordance of the
Bible and all his notes from doctrines and chemistry and his
epidemiological texts.

Now he was putting all that book learnin to work. 40 horses  veterinary
style

Our hero freed it up and put a fresh supply of 40 weight quaker God Bless
William Pennsoil. Then he ran a compression check on it  with his Makita
1/2&quot; drill attached to the generator pulley nut for a starter. #4 was
low... Hmmm
Thinking, he re torqued the heads... all nuts already close to
specs...Hmmm
When he adjusted the valves ...ALL EXHAUST TIGHT!!! 
He dumped oil in the #4.... instant compression.
what to do what to do... cleanse out the carb, file the pockmarked
points. Set the gap
Checked the coil with the  makita and a buzz box 6v battery charger. Blue
spark ! Mac Giver would have been proud.
 Yellow spark at the plugs. ;-(
 He checked the rotor... ah hah! Wrong rotor for the cap.&gt;&gt; too much
gap&lt;&lt;thus, our prodigal motor's secondary  ignition juice was jumping two
gaps; one at he distributor and one at he plug.

As best our hero can prophecy; some one ran it in their vee dub with out
adjusting the  valves and when it quit threw the wrong parts in it trying
to resurrect it. My friend bought the &quot;Bad motor&quot; and it sat gathering
rain water in the #4 cylinder.

 Hollander's foreign interchange manual and the holy Koran, I mean, &quot;the
how to keep your Volkswagen alive,a manual of step by step to Mecca for
the compleat al yankavitch&quot; put our hero's motor at a 1962 vintage (one
year off of feelgood kombi's birthday) but these heathen texts show
nothing of the way in which a saved motor should go. wither it be a bug
or bus.

We need another one of you trucken long haired friends of Jesus to come
along and shine the light on me,... ten four, join the convoy good
buddies

Can the engine numbers tell if it came out of a bus? Below the generator
stand there's the  #'s 6590055 and below that about an inch is a small WB
(in caps) stamped on it.

 (hey gonna set by you! another one rides the micro bus, and anther gets
on and another gets on another one rides the microbus)

god bless you Art Bell and Dr. Demento, wherever you are.

our hero
Dr. Frankenstein
61 kombi
67 bug

p.s. Does any one know of a way to get grease stains off of a interlinear
new testament?
