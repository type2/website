Subject: It's a good thing that it wasnt a police line-up!

I commute from one end of the Phoenix Metro area to another along a busy
East/West freeway. A to B, B to A. Day in- day out. The only lucky aspect of
the commute is that I travel against the main flow of traffic which allows me
to regularly do my part to help set the pace for the crazy speeds on the
Phoenix streets. Otherwise it is 45 minutes of boredom punctuated with &quot;Hey
Now! in the morning drive and NPR's OTC in the evening... hoo-hum.
It was a pleasant surprise for me to see Craig Koon enter the freeway in his
basic and highly oxidized bay window bus as I was screaming past a West bound
on ramp. Reducing speed from a billion and twelve down to that magically common
VW 62 mph &quot;sweet spot&quot; he glanced over at my equally oxidized nondescript black
F150 with tinted windows. I waved and he barely acknowledged me as if he didn't
know me from Adam. I removed my retro Ray-ban Wayfarer imitations and moved the
cowboy hat out of my face. He smiled, waved and finally recognized me. Instead
of resuming the pace of the other drivers who drive as if their hair was on
fire, I chilled out and sort of caravaned ahead of Craig looking for an exit
ramp and a convenient parking lot in which to meet and catch up on things for a
second before having to get back to our separate schedules.
We both exited at 32nd Street and proceeded North, roughly toward Craig's
neighborhood. Definitely out of the direct path to his house but hey, maybe he
was on errands. We pass several parking lots with obvious entrances. Well,
heck, perhaps he is on a tight schedule and was going to simply email me later
that evening. Totally understandable. I *KNOW* how radical those baby sitters
can get if you dare to run late- usually increasing the invoice like a
ticker-clock counting the compounding National Debt! A convenient traffic light
changes at an intersection with his bus and my dull truck along side of each
other. Yup, that's Craig. clean shaven, hook nose (sort of) and long pony-tail
in a gumby green~ quasi hand painted but not quite sure looking paint job.
Stickers of all sorts as I have seen before. I mean WTF, I've been to his
house. I know of which I observe. He waves and smiles but gives no indication
of pulling over.
I race ahead and indicate a turn into an OBVIOUS parking lot. I mean, crap,
I've only been trying to reach him on the phone and via email for a friggen
week. Pulling into this parking lot will be my opportunity to alert him to a
big ol' used book sale coming up this weekend. HE DOESN'T PULL IN!
I terminate my turn and proceed northbound chasing after him at this point
feeling totally silly. OK, cool, he recognized that I was still after him and
turned into a lot ahead of me.
We pull a long side of each other, both smiling and laughing as we exit the
vehicles. WHA...DAF? He starts to call me by a name that I don't recognize and
he corrects me as I blurt out Craig peppered with male bonding profanities...
Pfft! It was not Mr. Special-K but a definite clone driving a clone bus. It was
just then that I remembered that his gumbymobile was a hardtop, not a
dilapidated Westy top. Likewise, this Koonclone laughed in amazement thinking
that I was a dead ringer for one of his friends.
Awkward explanations and mutual amazement later we were both on our separate
routes. All I can say is I was glad that I was not picking the Koon of the day
out of a police line up (at 62 mph). Oops, my bad. Hey, Sailor I *REALLY*
wasn't cruising you, honest! (doh!)
Mr. K if you are out there give me a call or contact me via pmail.

(In actuality I have a good idea where he and his are currently located)
