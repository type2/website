hmmmm,  I do not like being lumped into THAT North Carolina group.
Neil Pickett

I agree with Neil on that ,,,,despite your problems don't lump us all into 
one group as bad, i spend my days restoring vw's and most of my nites either 
working on web pages with pics of restorations in progress,or answering 
questions people have e-mailed me with about what i do and even how i do it 
,,i give my opnions on their questions and such with out complaining and feel 
a bit of resentment about the lump comment ,,i have no problem with the 
e-mail and such ,,just a bit  respect for the time some of us take to help 
others and not be generalized as a NC ripoff because of a problem with some 
individual ,,my rep means alot to me and i intend to keep it intact at all 
costs ,,those who know me and my work know that is the way i am ,,if this is 
wrong i publicly say i'm sorry now ,,if not so be it ,,later
