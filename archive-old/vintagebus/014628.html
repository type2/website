Steve and others,

I drive my busses every day.  I have one 1955 Ch*vr*l*t Panel truck I drive 
to pick up more Volkswagens when necessary (none of my busses will haul my 
very heavy trailer and I won't tow a bus w/ unknown reduction boxes).  I know 
some people have other priorities, but I'd rather drive air-cooled if 
possible.

JP
