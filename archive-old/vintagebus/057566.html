Subject: Re: [VB] Need help with Tiger 581 CDI

That sounds right, so obviously there must be a problrm somewhere.
The CDI in bypass should just short the correct terminals to make it as
oriiginal. Ive run the tiger with pertronix and points in bypass and
normal and never had it overheat anything, Mine is also grounded with the
black wire and screwed to the chassis. I suppose its always possible that
the cdi is funky. You can see my bad install pix at
www.type2_dot_com/~andy
One other thing. The rotor has a resistor which will degrade it should be
bypassed or you can purchase a pre-done one from aircooled_dot_net.
I did my own. You need a dremel, wire, soldering iron and some epoxy. not
a big job.


&gt; I installed a Tiger 581 CDI and when I ran the vehicle the points wire
&gt; overheated and the points fried.  I have checked all the wiring and it looks
&gt; correct.  There are 5 wires from the CDI, 4 together and a fifth black wire
&gt; added that had a ring terminal on the end.  I assumed this to be for the
&gt; ground and have wired it to the battery ground.  The unit is also screwed
&gt; down to the body metal with two #6 sheet metal screws which should provide
&gt; some grounding.  The way I have the system wired up is:
&gt;
&gt; White wire from CDI to + on coil
&gt;
&gt; Black wire from CDI to - on coil
&gt;
&gt; Red wire from CDI to a contact strip with: 12V from ign. on, 12V feed to
&gt; electric fuel pump, idle cutoff valve and choke element
&gt;
&gt; Green wire from CDI to points
&gt;
&gt; Extra black wire with ring terminal from CDI to battery ground
&gt;
&gt; After further testing this is what I have so far.  I replaced the points and
&gt; condenser and then reversed the plug at the CDI for non-CDI function and
&gt; turned on the ignition.  The vehicle wouldn't start so I left the ignition
&gt; on and went to the back to check the wire.  The condenser wire was getting
&gt; really hot so I disconnected it before it melted again.  At that point I
&gt; noticed that the fuel pump got louder which led me to believe that there had
&gt; been significant current running through the connection from the CDI to the
&gt; condenser.  A short perhaps?  Is there any diagnostic procedures to test the
&gt; CDI unit in car?  Can anyone give me the URL for Universal Corporation's web
&gt; site?
