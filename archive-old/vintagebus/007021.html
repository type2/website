BowWow keeps their events page up to date:

  http://www.bowwowvw_dot_com/events.htm

It says:
July 14th 
  Burgermeat at the University Burgermaster in Seattle, WA
  info: Ken Madson (206)523-6525 
July 15th 
  19th Annual Vintage Meet at Shoreline Community College
  info: Ken Madson (206)523-6525 

I think Ken may be on the Type2 (Loaf) list... he has a nice hightop Loaf
that he uses for swaps (has business cards made up to match his bus).
