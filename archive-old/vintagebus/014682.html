&gt; Well gang, I finally had my turn at having the plug in a 30/31 PICT
&gt; give
&gt; out.  Mine is totally gone.
&gt; NOW WHAT??????????
&gt; I don't know what is involved in fixing it.  Help.

1. Make a sheet-metal plug to fit the hole
2. Put the plug in the hole.
3. Peen some metal over to hold the plug in place.
4. Seal the whole thing up with fuel-proof epoxy.
