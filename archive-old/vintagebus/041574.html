&gt; Speaking of turns to lock, I recently popped off the pittman arm(correct name???) so I could straighten the wheel (wasn’t too successful as there is too much play in the center pivot).  Upon centering up the wheel I reinstalled the arm.  To my dismay, I must have turned the wheel too many times as my turn to the left is WAY to short!  I think the QEII could make a left hand U turn in less space.
&gt; 
&gt; Is there a quick way to determine when the steering box is centered in its throw??  How many turns from lock does the output shaft have to go to get centered??
&gt; 

As I recall, there is only one proper position for the pitman arm on the
spline.  Only there will you get full-lock steering to both sides.

Once you get full-lock steering, then you remove the steering wheel and
reposition it.
