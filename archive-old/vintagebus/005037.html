&gt;Finding the 42mm is proving to be a challenge however. The best &gt;was to
order it from Snap-on for $42 plus an adapter 'cause it's 3/4&quot; &gt;drive for
$14. Ouch.


Snap-on good but Hazet still has the 42mm socket, you could get it from
Andrew Poston from Samstag Sales in TN, email him at agposton_at_dekalb_dot_net  or
check out his web page

I've done quite a bit of business with him, and he is an advertiser in the
Old Volks Pages.


Yes that was a shameless plug from Andrew.
