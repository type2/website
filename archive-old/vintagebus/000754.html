Since theres a little rib on the outside lip of the front wheelwell...(the 
dogleg..)
You must narrow the front beam for the tire to clear the lip.
Maybe it so you can ride &quot;COMPTON&quot; style!

Two sincere questions for the list ( not flames, I really want to know!)

a: Why would you want to narrow a bus front beam?

b: What all do you guys commonly think of as &quot;running gear&quot; ???
I thought it was drive train and rear axles/redux
boxes/spindle/drum/wheel..... Does front end get in there too?
Not that it is terribly important, but it is nice to know what we are
all talking about when we use this jargon....
