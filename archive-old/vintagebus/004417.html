Well not so crazy! But how about a short cut? Since you plan to make a female fiberglass mold, why not lay up a new bumper in fiberglass then mold in the steel while it is still in the mold. The back of the bumper is almost never seen anyway. If it works, you would already have the molds and could start a new business for the list to trash. By the way, YES the laundry should go back in the hamper.
