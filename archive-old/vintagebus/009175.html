Subject: 70 Westy Camper Manual Supplement (HOST?)
Date: Mon, 6 Mar 2000 10:44:20 -0600
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Just before I sold off my 71 Westy, I scanned in the camper manual
supplement.  I used the max dpi my scanner had (300dpi in full color) and
then I archived (zipped) the photos up.  Well I've never done anything with
this archive (it's almost 10 megs in length) and I was wondering if there is
anyone who would like to host this manual?  I was thinking along the lines
of www.type2_dot_com or even a private individual who would like to make these
scans available on the net.  They can be printed out and assembled into a
manual if someone wanted to.  The file is just hogging up disk space and I
no longer have any use for it.  I would surely think that this would be a
good resource to make available.  Please email me at silent_at_beatricene_dot_com
if you have any ideas...
