Subject: RE: [VB] steering &amp; suspension

Yeah, if you read back, I had priced parts at about $200. I had not thought
of spindles since play seems real tight in that area, but who knows what
might break during the tear down process. There is a wrecking yard about
thiry miles from me that said it had a front end for my 67 SC or van for
$250, but I am not sure as to its condition. But I guess that would be the
one I'm rebuilding, huh? I have recently done front breakes, wheel
cylinders, and master cylinder, (I did the late model master cylinder
upgrade with adapter plate). I really didn't want a bunch of stuff laying
around, but it sounds like the route to go, buy and rebuild another fron end
and then either sell mine or rebuild it and sell it. Hmmm, much to ponder,
lot's of explaing to the wife!

&gt; Hey,
&gt; This really pust me into a bind untill I get my VW trike licensed, the SC
is
&gt; my daily driver. I did notice that the original stock torsion bars in the
&gt; repair manual were a stack of leaves and the replacements were welded on
the
&gt; end. I am assuming that at some point between 63 and 67 the stock torsion
&gt; bars were all welded on the end. For my use I guess it doesn't matter. I
had
&gt; added up all the replacement parts to completely rebuild the front end
from
&gt; Bus Boys, and it came out to around $200. That didn't sound too
&gt; unreasonable, considering how long these componets seem to last. It's just
&gt; finding the time to put this up on blocks and do the deed. I guess the
&gt; spindles and all get checked at that time also.
Hey Ray,
What I did was buy a rebuildable front end and rebuilt it while driving.
Clara might have one cheap.  I bought spindles and steering box from
Wolfgang.  The spindles were a little over $200-220.  Link pin kits about
$75 I think, but mine is 67, forgot which year yours is.  I got the beam
blasted, then por'ed it.  New brake stuff was already there.  $2000 sounds
way high. I rebuilt mine for about $1000 including steering box, drag
link, tie rods, centerpin bushing, shocks, rebuilt exchange spindles from
Wolfgang.
