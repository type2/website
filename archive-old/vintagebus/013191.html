First Annual Gilligan's Island/ Gene Simmons Memorial Cruise:

VanBondo pulled an all nighter Weds night in full scramble mode. SS&amp;Shave
and hauled to Boring Helicopters by 0430hrs. Saw presunrise psilly-cybin
like rocket launch contrail from White Sands launch. Thought I'd have to be
calling Art Bell and a good Shrink until I heard what it was. Now I'm down
to only needing one of them...
Did a half day at work and grabbed three whole hours of sleep. Now I feel
like a new man. Unfortunately the new man is John Kennedy on November
*24th*, 1963. The communication &lt;clusterF/printf&gt; between the cruise mates
is in full On mode.
Dave Easterwood called from NM. I was unable to reach him when I tried to
return the call.

*Call the same number Dave!*
*Check your home email via that NEATO address, Dave!*

Directions are to drive to Phoenix and call from I-17 and Thomas Rd.
Call from there.

Paula is packing &quot;light&quot;. We are down to three tons of stuff. She's worth it.
Havent had this much fun since the night before my last endoscope exam.
