  Worn valve guides can also cause excessive oil in a cylinder causing the plug to oil foul

&gt;On my 63 Panel with what I think is a stock 40hp single port engine, I wanted to do a ring job due to plug on cylinder 
#4 getting extremely wet with oil thus fouling the plug and running on three cylinders. Now I know there could be 
other issues but I thought I'd start there, anyway, my question is a 2 parter; 
&gt;
&gt;1st: Can I upgrade the size of the cylinders without splitting the case and leaving all rotating components stock?
&gt;
&gt;2nd: Does anybody have suggestions on a vendor and or specific product?
