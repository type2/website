The trouble with the 34 PICT-3 and 009 setup manifests itself in a serious
off-idle hesitation.  The setup idles perfectly, however.  Most likely the
cause is a vacuum leak or plugged passage/jet in the carb, not the 009.

&gt;just make sure my automatic choke is adjusted properly and I have no problems
&gt;with idle or hesitation.  I also tend to take it easier now on my bus...
