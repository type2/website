Subject: anyone got contacts

Hi All,

A few people keep telling me that located in Germany and other places in
Europe, there are stashes of NOS rubber seals, buffers, gaskets and such
that I am desperately looking for to finish my 59 double cab... I continue
to run into dead ends and recyclers that I have called here in the states
respond to my requests with dumb expressions (or at least with a long blank
silence) when I ask for items on my list.  Ronnie has been scrounging his
collection for me and I've depleted a few other wonderful peoples boneyards
of necessary items.  The list really is getting shorter and shorter.

I refuse to end my quest since my list is down to a mere 10 to 20 little
items!!!  I also refuse to take my medication ;-)


So, anyone now whom to contact, and if required, German or what ever
language is need to converse with the keeper of such piles of stuff????


I YOU have any item on my list, most likely I've got a brand new repop one
that I'd be willing to trade along with some cash for you good used (or nos)
one.


David
