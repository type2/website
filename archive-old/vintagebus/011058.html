&lt;&lt;Sorry if I missed it in another post, but this is my first time to KP.   I 
hear that some camp in the vicinity Sat night.  Anyone care to share info on 
this?  Where?  TIA  Also, what are some simple directions when coming from 
the North on I5?&gt;&gt;

YES, PARK RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE MAIN ENTRANCE.
MAKE SURE YOU BRING YOUR WOOD TO HAVE A CAMPFIRE.
THE LOCAL POLICELOVE WHEN YOU HAVE BAR-B-Q'S RIGHT OUT FORNT OF THE PLACE.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT CLEANING UP, THROW YER TRASH EVERYWHERE.
Oops, I guess they said no camping this year right?
