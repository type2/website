Thanks for the info, Matt. You seem to be one of those kind folks mentioned recently that wants to
be sure everyone gets their questions answered.

On Buses up through '65, with the emergency flasher light to the
left of the speedo, you could use that light for the &quot;brake fail&quot;
light if you disconnected the wire from the emergency flashers
first.  If you wanted to use the light for both the emergency
flasher and the brake fail light, it would be best to use two
diodes to keep things separated.

&gt;Could you wire the brake fail light to the emergency flasher light?
&gt;How would you do this?
