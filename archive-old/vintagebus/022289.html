I think this a part that some forget. Being a Jr. High teacher I get
countless questions from my students that if they took five minutes to look
it up they would not have interuppted me while I was helping a student who
*can't* read, not won't. Of course they still have to find the answer as I
won't do for them what they can do for themselves. I am finding this to be
a growing trend in society as a whole.

My personal experience with Bob has been positive. Before I found the
Vanagon list (before the origonal split) Bob was all I had to keep me
going. Sure there is the newsgroup but they had a limited knowlege base. I
would always try to find the answer first, and when I did write Bob I would
let him know that I looked here and there before I came bugging him.

Can you imagine if Michael Jordan had an e-mail address that was public??
Let's see here this one of from Larry:
Larry:	&quot;dear Mr. Jordan. I want to be able to slam dunk. Why can't I?&quot;

Reply: &quot;Dear Larry, have you tried going outside to a hoop yet?&quot;

Larry: &quot;Wow, you mean I have to actually try first??????&quot;

Bob is a VW Superhero. Just like Muir, Berg, and others before them. We
should respect him for what he has done for the VW community as a whole,
try to learn from his experience (The Sermons), and just maybe cut him a
little slack. Heaven knows he has been cutting us (the one's who ask for
help) slack for a long long time.
