My top 10 reasons I love my '66 camper:
1 Best surfing/camping car by the beach or campground EVER
2 Natural limit on speed keeps me cool and wise on the slow side
3 Beautiful while stationary
4 Cool and fun when in motion
5 Simplicity in maintenance (although I'm far from learning all the ropes)
6 Very inexpensive for parts
7 Great educational tool into the automotive world and to attempt it on
my own
8 Most VW owners/folks share a sense of camaraderie and I am proud to be
a small part of it
9 It makes me feel wiser on the secrets of life than the occupants from
the surrounding lanes (baseless I know)
10 Sitting high and above, and soon to be had SAFARI WINDOWS! (Creative
Engineering rocks, and coming to the US to attend shows soon according
to the guy on the phone)

My top 10 reasons I love my '00 4runner:
1 Gas/mialage, surprisingly! It uses about just as much as the Ford
stationwagon in our family comfy.
2 Power rear window that goes down - my dogs DIG it! (BTW imagine the
flames if I conjure up a power safari rear hatch window.)
3 When you feel like climbing a hill at 65 mph, you can
4 Residual value stays high for its high quality
5 Climate control is an instant easy fix
6 It is, IMHO, a beautiful truck
7 Rainy days is a piece of cake when I can use 4wd on hwy, passing big
rigs w/ ease
8 If I accidentally got rich beyond my capabilities, I can use it to tow
a small boat! 
9 Completely indifferent to potholes or muni rails. Very smooth and
confy ride
10 Sitting high and above, and ok I admit I like the power sunroof

I really enjoy being 'that cool guy in the VW Bus', and I like my SUV
for its sharpness in function. But if a choice has to be made, I will
keep the bus over the truck. Personal preference. That guy who belittled
our busses had no clue what he's missing. Some people are just too dull
to appriciate a delicacy offered in life. 

Ricky
