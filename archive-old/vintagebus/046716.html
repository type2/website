 This must be a low-hinge door thing.  None of my doors have ever had
 removable tops...

 &gt; on the cargo doors you can remove the rubbery plastic cover from the top 
of 
 &gt; each hinge and oil the wick.  If you don't have caps I think they are 
reproed 
 &gt; now, they are cute and pointy where they plug up the wick ans slightly

p/n 211 841 529 cap- sleeve   uses 8   all models  - from 67 ed parts list

is in 63 ed parts list
is not in 58 ed parts list'
my 61 has one left 
the high hinge doors have a diferent shape pin through the hinge

yup Thom seems like it is a low hinge thing
