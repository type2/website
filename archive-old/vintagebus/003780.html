Looks like everybody is doing it so might as well, here we go. Three weeks
after bringing it home I had only a few occasions to look around my 63
project. As you know this one has been stripped down, sand blasted and then
painted using Rust Oleum ugly green paint. In order to paint this baby right
I have to strip the entire thing now, fix all the dents, dings (there is
plenty of both) and rust and paint again. It's gonna be a long process. So
far I was able to strip half the roof today and start work on the nose. Nose
has the most damage. I just got a chance to grind and sand the nose and
lower skirt today. It still needs to be pulled out in some areas. I don't
think that there is body part on my bus that wouldn't have some kind of dent
or ding. Perhaps the roof? Not really since there is some rust damage to it.
Engine bay has not been done at all. Surprisingly! Today I spent half a
Sunday on cleaning all the gunk and grime off. I'll paint this area first
and then start with the engine. I'd like to have the bus road worthy before
even finishing the paint. That much has been done today. Actually I'm not
done yet but came here with questions. That is a separate subject though.
Next weekend I'll probably be working on the nose and still, stripping the
roof. Well, it'll be worth it though. I want to do it all right so I can
enjoy my bus for a while.

Later,
