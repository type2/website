There have been some who say that the dual cirquit brake master cylinder
was a '67 only option.  This code is listed as &quot;430&quot;.  This code is on the
tag in my June built '66 Westy.  I haven't verified if it's there yet, but
the code is there.  I'll be back tomorrow with my findings.  Any other '66
late model built busses/trucks have this code?
later

the dual circuit brake system was standard on us buses as of early 67 model
year (nov 66 production, I wrote the VIN of change in a recent post re dual
circuit msater cylinders).  I would believe it was available as an option
earlier.   BUt I would not expect to find such a thing on a 66.   Believe the
430 m code is US specs
