(lookout!  another harsh post.  no wannabe-hippie content though)

Well, you can't please all the people all the time.  

Here are some points to consider:

* It's called the Kelley Park *Vintage* meet.  While I won't 
go into the qualifications for &quot;vintage&quot;, suffice it to say that
if *you* aren't the one putting on the event, *you* don't get
to pick.  That's life - we live in a world where various groups
get excluded all the time.

* you can still attend, you just can't drag in your vanagon, new beetle or race car

* the area that they hold the show in is *quite* small; like the earth
we live on, it can't accomodate an exponentially expanding population -
something has to give.

* the area that the show is held in is kinda fragile, landscaping
wise.  Having several hundred VW's parked on the *wet* lawn and driving thru
the bushes can't be good for the foliage.  

* you can give an extra-special thanks to the punks who were *deliberately* 
doing burnouts on the wet grass.  Heck, my barndoor can do that, and it
doesn't have an engine!

* by my estimate, they turned away a couple *hundred* cars last time.
Irrespective of people's attitudes about &quot;vintage&quot;, *something* had to be done.
Imagine the amount of torqued people who had cars that WERE hands-down vintage
(ie ovals &amp; splits) that couldn't get in because joe swapper had his dually
and trailer full of greasy super beetle trailing arms, or jonny rocket
with his slammed GTI

* I predict pandemonium in the surrounding parking areas.  All of those
VW's parked out of their owner's watchful eye will be too much to resist:
look for a bumper crop of parts on ebay in the weeks after the show.

Other issues:

* if the majority of the people are walking in, they're going to have to
streamline the walk-in process considerably.

* if it's show-cars only, there's going to be a LOT of show cars; will they
be ready to deal with processing them?

* who gets to decide what gets in and what don't?  I predict this to be a
big onsite bone of contention.

* am I the only one who gets really annoyed at all the kiddies trying to out-blast
each other's stereos?

Something else to consider: why not have pre-registered classes for show cars?
Anything to streamline the process of getting your car in and thru the gate.
For a venue this small, and with the number of people trying to get their cars
in, pre-registration really makes sense.   

The only way you're going to be able to handle that many cars, and not have
to make hard choices about what can get in and what can't, would be to move it to
a big open field, like the b*g-o-rama.  Gee, then you'd get to listen to drag
racing all day and see the silicone beauties working thry the crowd passing out flyers 
for the local strip joints.  If I wanted to see strippers, I'd host a bachelor party.

Look at it this way:

What makes kelley park different is the focus on VINTAGE cars.  It's *the* NorCal show to 
go to to see a bunch of nice, EARLY cars that you DON'T get to see on the street
every day.  I see vanagons and bay-windows every single day.  I don't see 49 split
bugs or (driving) barndoors every day.   Every spot taken by a lagwagen, GTI,
new beetle, super beetle or vanagon  is one less spot for a heb or a split or a kubel.
