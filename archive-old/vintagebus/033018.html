having seen the tent in 'real life',   I can honestly say it is really nifty. 
  nice stripes and 50's colour combination tastefully done, with 
interestingly different pole attachment to roof than the later style.     He 
even has the VW portapotty (talk about vintage accesories!)

Too bad Thom looks so funny hobbling around with one arm and leg.   :)
