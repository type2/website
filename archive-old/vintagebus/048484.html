Subject: [VB] Need A (Locking) Steering Box
Message-Id: &lt;l03130300b44bcc82493e_at_[208.46.99.176]&gt;

After replacing every component on my westys' front end including the
obligatory center pin/bushings, it looks like I need to replace the
steering box as well.

I need a locking steering column to replace the original. Does anyone
besides the bus boys sell them? I am willing to put a non-locking unit in
to keep the cost down.  I like the locking feature, but I'm not hung up on
it. I guess this is a who-to-go-with /who-to-stay-away-from question, too.

Any direction would be appreciated. Thanks!
