Hello!

I've only been lurking here for 1 day, but I've spent the weekend reading through the archives.

I've had several types I &amp; III VWs when I was a teenager and early 20's, but haven't had anything for the past 20 years or so until
my daughter fell in love with classic bugs and I bought her a '69 a few months back.  The fever came back and I ran across '60
Single Cab for sale that is the middle of restoration.

I read the ad in the paper and the guy sent me pics via email (you can see them at www.wyricks_dot_com/vw ) that cought my interest.  So
I made arrangements to take the 2 hour drive to check it this last Saturday.  It was great timing as I was able to go to the OCTO
show in the morning to ask questions and get a feel for older type II's.  (If you like playing &quot;Where's Waldo&quot; you can see my son
and me in Thom Fitspatrick's pics of the event....we're in the 1st 3 pics near the bottom).  After seeing the asking price of the
Single Cabs at that event, I was even more interested.

Anyway, the story goes it was a daily driver when the guy &amp; his son decided to restore and as far as I can see they've done
everything right.  You can see from the pics what has been done.  All the bushings/bearings/brakes are new, new wiring loom, new
lights &amp; lenses (even the rear), and boxes of rubber and chrome things from Wolfsburg West to be put on still.  I only found a
couple small rust holes (behind the rubber seal on the bottom of the of the passenger side door jamb), so I was pretty happy.

So I just bought it for $2,200 today.  I'll go back out on July 1 to pick it up and then the fun will start!

I've already found a bunch of good information in the archives, but I am sure I'll think of some odd questions to ask the group
soon.  Glad to have this great resource.

Well, I just had to share this w/someone (my wife is only mildly amused at having a project in the driveway).

I'd be interested in getting feedback from the group about the job I'm up against and things to watch for.

Thanks,

-Tom
