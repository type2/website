Many, many years ago I saw a shortened single cab,
that was so short, (how short was it!) badump bump,
It was so short that the rear wheel of a bicycle
just barely touched the deck with the front wheel
against the cab.

Not to be alone in this mania, I have seen a Ford
crewcab with a similarly shortened bed.
