I have a VW factory published repair manual for '68-'70 Type 2 vehicles.

Publication info.:

    Copyright 1970 Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft
    All rights reserved   -   Printed in Germany
    42-00-0    192-1

This manual, of course, covers vehicles with a 1600 single port engine.

Within the 14 pages of tightly printed &quot;Technical Data&quot;, in the &quot;Engine&quot;
section, there is a table pertaining to road speed in the various gears, the
RPM at various speeds, piston speeds, etc.

For all body styles and trims, except the &quot;Pick up (with tarpaulin)&quot;, the
&quot;Maximum and cruising speed&quot; is given as 65 MPH &quot;at an engine speed of 3900
RPM&quot;.

It further states that &quot;Mean piston speed at maximum road speed; feet per
min.&quot; is 1774.

The table goes on to give &quot;Road speed at an engine speed of 4000 RPM&quot;.  The
road speed given for 4000 RPM in 4th gear is 67 MPH.

Granted, there is some ambiguity between the maximum speed at 3900 RPM and
the road speed at 4000 RPM reference.  But neither of these numbers hints at
or suggests support or approval for winding the engine up to 5000 RPM under
any conditions or circumstances.

The road speed numbers from this manual obviously don't apply to a splitty
with reduction boxes, but the stated RPM figures pertain to an engine that
is arguably more advanced than the earlier engines with smaller
displacements.

For what it's worth.....

&gt;&gt; The vw is redlined at 5000 rpm for sustained use. Calc your speed at that
rpm and you have your top end speed. I think it will surprise you. (you may
not want to go that fast; brakes, handling, etc.) &lt;&lt;
