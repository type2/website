Actually it says &quot;Courtesy fleet vehicle not for sale&quot;.
No problem everett, my friend made those stickers, Ill see if I can hook you 
up.
hey, Question.....
Would it be possible for you to pick a bumper up from Wade and deliver it to 
pomona for me?
Are you going?
rafferty was asking about the middle seat too, whether you would be there or 
not.
Please let me know.
Thanks-
Greg
