Subject: re:polishing trim

i went to a chrome plating place about two years ago. the guy there(been in
business for a very long time, did a lot of work for NASA-as we were in
houston.

anyway-he siad never use steel wool on chrome. unfortunately he told me too
late. i had used chrome on the arms that hold my side view mirrors. made
them look better-but it was only short term, they rusted quicker than they
should have, and i think it is due to the steel wool.

if you do a search in the archives, i remember some guy on the list going
nuts polishing all his trim...probably over two years old.

good luck
