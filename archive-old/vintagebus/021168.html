&gt; did you send a similar email to others who regularly
&gt; post implying they know 
&gt; about old VWs, such as VeeWee111 or Ronnie of
&gt; OldVolks or the guy who answers 
&gt; all the electrical ?s Matt I think his name is
&gt; asking how they claim to know 
&gt; about old buses??????????????    Like I mean, what
&gt; is the big deal?  Is it a 
&gt; bad thing to answer people's questions asking for
&gt; help?   Some people even 
&gt; make money off it.   It's not that as a woman I know
&gt; about VWs is it?  truth 
&gt; is I was too poor to pay a mechanic to rip me off so
&gt; I learned to fix it 
&gt; myself.  Or do you really think it is offensive to
&gt; learn foreign languages?   
&gt; If so, no wonder the Parisians are rude to you if
&gt; you go there.  They are 
&gt; rude to tourists frequently from what I hear.  Gave
&gt; a friend of mine bad 
&gt; directions on purpose (he spoke no french).
&gt; 
&gt; ?????????????
&gt; 
&gt; What's up, I don't get what you are upset at me
&gt; about?  don't be that way.  
&gt; If you are annoyed that I don't think the US gov't
&gt; is perfect, well, I don't. 
&gt;   I guess you have a point there. 
&gt; 
&gt; Again, sorry that I hit the wrong button, I did mean
&gt; to pmail my response. Of 
&gt; course we are all thinking and talking about it.  
&gt; Just seemed like it could 
&gt; easily be an off topic flame war with everyone
&gt; having strong emotions.   I 
&gt; apologise for that post to the list as I really did
&gt; not want to encourage 
&gt; arguments re terrorism, opinions on international
&gt; stuff, what should be done 
&gt; etc etc etc *on the list*.   Mea culpa.  I f...ed
&gt; up.
&gt; 
&gt; Hope all is well with you.
