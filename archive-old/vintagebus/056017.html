I don't know how many people on this list are in or around Dallas, I =
know of at least one, whom I have never met, but I saw a small story in =
the newspaper about a get together of &quot;pre-1967 enthusiasts&quot; at the =
Dream Cafe, 2:30 Sunday.

Anybody here know of this? I'm going to go there. See you there?
