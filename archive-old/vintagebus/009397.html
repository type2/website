hey,

Stephen White's idea for a coffee holder is the best I've heard yet.  The good thing is you probably already own it!  I'm talking about that miraculous stuff called Duct Tape.

Grab one of the larger rolls off your pile and put it on the dogleg next to your left thigh, between the seat and the door.  The sticky sides hold it in place nicely and it's the right size for a number of different bevarages.  

&quot;Everywhere Ed&quot; made it back to NM in the Barnhaufwagen.  He was supposed to weigh at a scale when the got there, but no official word yet We estimated his gross weight when he left St Louis to be well over 5000 lbs!!  Think about that when you're debating whether or not your bus can handle a simple commute....

Drive yer bus,
Curt
