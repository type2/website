&lt;&lt; Let me confirm that the front shift linkage should have the square headed 
bolt and tie down on it.&gt;&gt;
Hi Merideth,
Correct.  The front connection up to about 1962 should have two bolts, and 
1963-67 only have one.  When you install a square head bolt it is not only 
importent to safety wire it, but to do it in a way that does not allow the 
bolt to loosen any.  In other words you want the wire to be turning the bolt 
tighter so it will not loosen one bit.

&lt;&lt; The back one at the trans does have this.  &gt;&gt;
The back shift connector shold have two for all year that we know of.
