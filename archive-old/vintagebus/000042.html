I've dealt with Jeff  hes REAL cooL.   Just Don't LEAVE THE DOORS OPEN!  if 
you close all the doors and be real nice he will hook ya UP.   Although he 
only has 3 splits.   2 of which you can get parts off of the other he wants 
$500 for and will not part out.  is in not that bad of shape.  every time 
i've  been there i've gotten Boat loads of cooL bus stuff.  ARM LOADs for 
under $10 bucks.  but don't go there expecting to find any cool Accessories.  
It just has your basic body panels windows and other neccessary parts.  
because  I and other fellow Bus Nazi's back in North West FL.   and  I think 
the bus you are talking about is Robin's bus?  was it 65 deluxe?  with beige 
top and flat black bottom?  but.  JEFF is the best there ever was.  I compare 
him to John Muir  he truely is The VW wizard.  He is a old Porsche 356 NUT so 
when you go its always good to take a good 356 story.  but thats the Low Down 
with him.
