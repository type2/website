I was wondering if the &quot;jacket&quot; that covers the expandable metal
heater hoses that join the heater boxes to the body contains asbestos?
 I've breathed some of that stuff in a few times...

I don't want to be hacking up lung fragments when I'm using my
warp-drive powered Bus for off-planet NOS parts searches in the year
2011.  (Yeah right, like we won't all be slaves to alien invaders by
then)
