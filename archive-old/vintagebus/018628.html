Oh boy.

I'm spinnin' now.

See, I figured-out that the only non-abrasive thing
which took the black paint off of DARTHVW's dash and
cab interior was Goof-off(tm) 
(funny, it doesn't do a thing on the exterior, maybe
the PPO rattle-canned the interior, or MAACO has a
different formula for interiors. Anyway...) 
I just finished getting the passenger side headlight
bucket, heat vent and center tube-thing back to the
original cumulus white. Looks nice. The only problem
is: now I have a goof-off aftertaste in my mouth. 

Ever lick a 9-volt battery, and it leaves that metal
taste in your mouth? Well, like that. Only the taste
is like chemicals or old TESTOR'S model glue (not the
safe stuff in the blue tube which smelled like lemons,
but the yellow-tubed stuff. The hard stuff. Yep, the
stuff those Junior High-school films warned you about)

I feel like crap now. Like, I'm scared. Like I'm going
to die of cancer.

But I really want the black paint out of there. 

Suggestions?

I want to live. 

I have a two-month old daughter I want to see grow up.

A fan? I guess I should blow a fan through the cab
when I'm working. Just the Southern California ambient
air isn't enough.


What can I do about this taste? Yikes.

Always read the warning label, folks.


I'm going to go pray now. 

Then barf.
