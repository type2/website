Ya here in WA  they are so sweet and helpful and friendly, short lines, if 
any.  Then again, it is called the DOL, not the DMV, so that is probably why. 
 I registered my 53 with the YOM plates, no problem.  This county doesn't 
even bother with smog, most of the little air pollution comes from slash 
burns on the Olympic Penninsula (in other counties) anyway.

The only time I had a good experience at a CA DMV was when I was on crutches 
with a broken leg.  They rolled out the friggin red carpet.  Opened up a new 
window for me, were really nice and helpful.  People waiting in mile long 
lines glared.  Had to deal with some paperwork to bring Bugster here.

 I think the DMV people are the ones who under any other circumstances would
 have been handed a D*arwin award.
