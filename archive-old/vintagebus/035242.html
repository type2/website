Subject: 1967 Singlecab inside mirror
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

All--

Re the interior rearview mirror for a 1967 singlecab:

There doesn't seem to be a reproduction of this particular part.  Or is 
there?  Is this one-year-only?  Any offers to sell used ones?

BTW, I do have the original (?) mirror, but the ball is so loose in the hole, 
that it just flops down and you get a good view of the front seat.--David
