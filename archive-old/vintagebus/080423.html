Subject: Need recommendation for a machinist in Phoenix

Is there a machinist you would recommend in the PHX area? My #3 exhaust valve 
seat has sunken. It's caught in time and no other damage was found, except 
maybe a stretched valve stem.

I have Havasu to fall back on I know.. PHX is closer tho w/ a little more 
veriety of food, a zoo to take kids to, blah, blah, blah.

Thanks in advance.

Ricky
