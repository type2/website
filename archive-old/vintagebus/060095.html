Subject: Re: [VB] Emergency light switch and knob on a 66 bus




&gt; Does anyone have a digital photo, or could take a digital photo of the
emergency light knob on a 66 bus?

&gt; I want to fit one to my UK bus, but a 66 switch is different to pre 66, and
any switch is rare in the UK.

&gt; Could someone also recommend any 2nd hand car part dealers in the US that
may be able to supply with a switch and knob - I think the part number of the
switch body is 111 953 235 or the same suffixed by an A on a 67.

&gt; Thanks
&gt; Paul

I just went and took the switch out of my 66. The knob is the identical shape
as the headlight and wiper knobs but all red. The body of the switch has part
# 111 953 505 on it. I will take pics of it and pmail them to you.
