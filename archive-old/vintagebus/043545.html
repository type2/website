&gt;You may feel safer with a sticker of approval from Big Brother, but it's
&gt;likely to be just an illusion!

Ah, responsibility!

In a state without inspections, you have the freedom to keep your car
in as good a state of repair as you like.  You have an incentive to
maintain it somewhat, because then it doesn't break down as much and
cause you grief.  But if you want to run the brake linings down to
the rivets, or skip the cotter pins in your rear axle nuts, you are
free to do so.

At least, that is, until you can't stop and rear-end ME.  Or your
wheel comes off on the highway and comes through my windshield.
Then I have an interest in how you take care of your car, too.

I agree that the current system of inspections is not perfect and
could use changes.  It either needs to not exist at all (I would
not prefer this) or have some teeth in it (TUeV, anyone?)

On TUeV and the German safety laws: Yep, they're pretty strict.
As an example, if you own a split or early bay with drum front
brakes, you are REQUIRED to convert to discs before getting your
license.  On the other hand, you'd probably like to have good
brakes when you're doing 80 (OK, a T4 Bay) on the Autobahn and
suddenly have to slow down to 60 because of a big truck.  The
people in the Benz passing you at 100 also appreciate that your
vehicle is in good working order. 

&gt;I'm also leery of annual inspections, as they can be a step toward
&gt;&quot;clunker laws&quot; that make it difficult or impossible to drive the older
&gt;vehicles that we all love.

Funny, this is how I feel about smog inspections (as opposed to
straight safety inspections).  The clunker laws are about smog
and &quot;pollution credits&quot;, not roadworthiness.  Another poster
mentioned it.  Basically how it works is the EPA says chemical plant
X can emit Y tons per year of, say, carbon monoxide.  The chemical
company knows that if they run the plant full tilt like they want
to, they'll make about 2Y tons of CO.  Instead of reducing output,
or investing in equipment to clean up their own emissions, they
can trade pollution credits.  If a newer chemical plant Z only
emits 0.5Y tons per year of CO, it can sell the extra part of
its allowance to chemical plant X.  X is now good for 1.5Y tons
of CO.  To cover the remaining 0.5Y tons, they go along to the
state and the EPA and get them to declare that any car older
than 30 years (say) emits 0.01Y tons of CO a year.  So once they
buy and destroy 50 old cars, they're home free.  Sometimes there
is smog testing of the vehicles they buy, but usually not.

Old-car enthusiasts understandably freaked when this started
happening.  At first you couldn't get anything off the doomed
cars, not even the brake drums or side trim.  I believe this
has been relaxed - it's sufficient to remove the engine and
drivetrain (more 36hp parts gone forever) and the body can
be salvaged as normal.

I think a good alternative would be for the chemical company
to pass out cheap tune-ups, with smog readings before and after.
If they reduce a car's emissions by so much, they get that much
added to their plant emissions.  I don't know if this has been
implemented or not.
