Hi Mark,
We had the same thing happen at the fuel pump outlet in a stretch of I-5 that 
has no place to pull over!  To prevent this from happening in the first place 
one can center punch numerous times into the casting in the fuel pump and 
carb around the brass tube to shrink the hole it is pressed in.
