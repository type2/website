Subject: Re: [VB] sandblasting logistics question (kinda long).

and that was my main question the other day but I got &quot;almost&quot; no response.
In my case there is something else I will do to get rid of the rust and prep
the surface at the same time. I deal with a &quot;sandblaster&quot; guy that promised
me to take care of all the rust spots (not many) on my 65 and completely
clean (blast) the underbody from all the paint, grease and any other road
debris at the same time. He's gonna use some kind of plastic media for
blasting though instead of sand (says it's better for the surface). After
that I thought I might just throw some POR-15 in some places (mostly
underbody) and regular primer/paint combo in the engine bay. I think
blasting will ensure that I'll get rid of most of the rust and grime before
painting instead of traditional method - wirewheel on an angle grinder or a
drill. Removing tranny and front beam will only help in getting into every
nook and cranny......now here's my problem though... I have to figure a way
to transport my bus to the shop without the beam and tranny..... oh well,
that's me.

I would definitely blast before paint... otherwise like you said, you're
just hiding rust away for later.......which in the meantime it's eating your
Bus!!

In my neck of the woods people don't drive Busses year round......I know I
won't.
Sorry for such a long rant.......

&gt; I would like to slean off the original paint primer, and slight patched of
&gt; surface rust on the underbody and engine
&gt; before replacing these assemblies. Assuming a 40 gal pressure sandblaster,
&gt; suffcient air and materials, what is the time frame in hours that can
&gt; be anticipated for sandblasting at least the entire engine bay and the
cargo
&gt; area rear ward? I would like tot do the front at a seperate venture, since
&gt; my front floors need attetnion, and I would rather hav ethe beam out
before
&gt; throwing sand around there (cargo rearward=no holes)
&gt; Choosing to avoid blasting at this time, is it wise to apply anythign
then?
&gt; Any notion of undercoating or paints tend to make me believe
&gt; I am just hiding the surface corrosion, and is best removed entirely, or
&gt; entirely later.
