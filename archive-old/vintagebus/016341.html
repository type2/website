Typically, you'll have the power come from the front, connect to the
choke, then the coil, then the electromagnetic cut-off.  If you've got
backup lights, there'll be a wire with an inline fuse that goes off
somewhere for them, as well.

Wouldn't melt the coil, since the power wouldn't be going through the
coil in that case.  It'd be straight from hot wire to ground, and melt
the wire.
