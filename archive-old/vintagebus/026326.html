All of this isn't necessary.  In California you can just register it as
a non-operational vehicle.  It's only 5 bucks, and you don't need
insurance, and the DMV won't cancel your registration.  The only kicker
is that you cannot move the vehicle off whatever property it's on.  By
the way, if your bus is on private property, it doesn't even need to be
registered at all, I had a 78 loaf that was in my driveway for 6 months
with no tags, windows, or engine and nobody hassled me.
