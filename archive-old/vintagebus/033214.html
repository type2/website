Subject: Jerome Jamboree IX Raffle Bus!

Well, we did it!!  We have a split for the next Raffle bus for JJIX.  Those of
you who saw the custom Hawiian camper we gave away last year know the
extent/quality of work/parts that went into it.  Plans for this year are to
put together a bus that is every bit as nice (if not more so).

This year's grand prize:       a 1965 Double Cab ! ! !

We had hoped to be able to score such a vehicle but were not too optimistic
about it since pickups are such a 'hot item' and command a usually HIGH price.
Many thanks are needed to be sent to vwhoward (John Howard) of Lake Havasu
City for keeping the ABC in mind and giving us first shot at the DC.

The DC is a bit 'rough but do-able' (in the humble opinions of those of us who
made the collective decision to go for it).  There are a few panels to
replace, but, unlike last year's camper, we won't have any custom cabinets to
build (thanks again Kyle), or fancy upholstery to have made.  The tentative
plan is to get it back to Phoenix, strip it, get whatever welding/panel
replacement/body work done, and get it on the road (at least towable) so that
it can be presented at Corona de Tucson in early March.  Depending on its
condition, there is a slight possibility it could be towed to Buses By the
Bridge in January, but we won't count on it.

For those not familiar with the ABC's &quot;raffle bus&quot;, every year we acquire a
split, fix it up, and raffle it off at Jerome Jamboree in September.  If you
want more info on this, please e-mail me off the list (don't want to wear out
our welcome).  Any way, the raffle bus is put together with donations as much
as possible from such vendors as Wolfsburg West, West Coast Metric, and Koch's
(who donate a new steering wheel every year).  (Hope that's not too much of a
commercial 'plug').  Some of the things we will be looking for right away are:

front floor sections (both sides)
outer rockers (both sides)
inner rockers (both sides)
cargo floor section (right side against cargo door)
cargo floor section (in front of gas tank) 
rear seat (both cushions)
rear seat stand

Yeah, yeah, it's a lot of work and a lot of stuff.  But it'll be worth it in
the long run.  If anyone has any of this stuff they can donate or sell real
cheap to the club, please let me know.  All donations/discounts are
recognized/advertised by the club.

Thanks in advance for any help,

Jon Stanton, President
Arizona Bus Club

PS: (Sorry if this is pushing the 'bus content' thing for the list)
