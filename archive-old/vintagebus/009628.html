&gt;Any comments?

Roger,
I've used both.  Rubber lines many years ago, and I didn't have alot of
trouble with them.
This was back on one of those oil cooler adapters that did away with the
stock oil cooler.
Seemed like a good idea at the time.  It would have been difficult to check
the fittings/clamps back there.  I ran a Rapid Cool over the fan intake and
one out on the driver's side of the bus.  A filter inside the engine
compartment.  It worked a good while, but I wouldn't do it that way now.
I use the ss/teflon now because I feel like it's alot more secure and less
vulnerable to the elements and heat from the engine and oil.  SS/teflon are
not hard lines, but you can't bend them too much or they'll kink.  In theory
the teflon should also provide a less restrictive flow path for the oil, but
I don't know if it makes all that much difference.


&gt;The oil pressure when an engine is cold is high, but I don't think it
&gt;gets up to 100 psi or does it?
If you do a full-flow set up the filter and cooler if added would see much
more on a cold morning since this stuff is before any relief valves.  A
relief pump cover will solve this problem though.


 Clamps do
&gt;need periodic tightening, but periodic line inspections should be done,
&gt;too. I've had hard lines and fittings leak about as often as clamps.
If the fittings are properly swaged on to the lines it seems to me the
lifetime should be very long.  These are aircraft type fittings and lines.
They aren't really hard lines.  They are a teflon hose with a stainless
steel braid jacket that protects the inner hose from things like rocks and
also keeps the inner hose from ballooning from overpressure.  It makes them
kind of pricey for initial investment, but you put them on and hopefully
forget about them.  The price is that you might spend  $50-75 on hoses (just
to the filter and back), so I can't blame a person for using rubber oil
line.  My oldest full flow set up like this is probably about 8 years old at
the oldest but I would hope for at least a 15 year lifetime.  I don't think
I'd go down the road worrying about a blowout if I ran rubber lines.  I'd
probably change them every couple of years though.

John
