Didn't know that (I tend to take my buses as they are, rather than
worry about being an authenticity freak; there're other parts of my
life that use up any such ambitions).  It's either a Kombi or a
Standard, going by the fact that it doesn't have chrome trim at the
paint line (nor holes for mounting the trim, of course).  The title
says it's a Kombi, but as far as I've seen, *all* microbus titles say
they're Kombis, including some from the mid-70s....

Looking at the definitions in Thom's bus FAQ, I'm pretty sure it's a
Standard.  Has a cloth headliner and two-tone paint (white on green).
The front door panels have brown vinyl on the upper 2/3rds or so, with
white below.  It doesn't have carpet anywhere, though (rubber mats
front and back).
