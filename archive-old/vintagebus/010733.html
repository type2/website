Anyway, back to bus content.  As I think I mentioned, I won't be converting my
bus.  I was never that serious in the first place, just wanted to know if
anyone had ever done it.  The main reason I'm not going to do it stems from a
phone conversation I had with an individual the other night.  This individual
is supposedly VERY knowledgeable about buses.  He's not on this list, I don't
think he's into computers, the Internet or mailing lists.  Anyway, he told me
something I found very interesting, which I would like to see if anyone on the
list can confirm.

Supposedly, all 15 Window buses were special orders from the factory.  I had
never heard this before.  Is this true?  It seems that if this were true more
people would be aware of it.

the non sunroof deluxes came with a M code specifiying this.  Think it's 130
on the M-code plate.   it means the regular deluxe came with the roof widgets.

it does not mean they were special orders, however, if you mean by special
order that an individual requested it.   There are a lot of usual Mcodes, but
that does not mean special order.   I figure my 65westy is a special order, as
it has an unusual selection of options, bought in Germany with US specs etc.  

that said, it should also be mentioned that it seems there are a lot more non
sunroof deluxes around than ones with the sunroofs, particularly the 64-67s.
in the 50s, non sunroof deluxes are less common than sunroof deluxes.
