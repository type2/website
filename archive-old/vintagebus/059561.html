Subject: Re: [VB] metal flakes in oil! Help! - Painting engine case

Volkswagen Canada used to have an engine remanufacturing facility in =
Scarborough, Ontario (part of Toronto). Since VWOC and VWOA merged they =
have significantly cut back if not altogether cosed this facility

&gt;The paint has to be a market thing. If you look at all your books that =
show
&gt;old pics of the assembly lines, nowhere do you see painted trans or =
engine.
&gt;They have been building this thing for shy of eighty years (figure in the
&gt;Mexican, Brazilian, and Argentinean production still going on), so they =
must
&gt;know something.


Just as soon as you state something you know to be true,
some wiseacre pops up to contradict it. Case in point ( ! ) :
I have an &quot;original&quot; Canadian VW replacement V-gon case
( and the &quot; remanufactured &quot;sticker to prove it )
which has some cheap greenish-gold spray paint all over it.
I stripped all but the flywheel area and powdercoated it silver.
The cheap stuff didn't burn off in the oven, but rubs right off
with lacquer thinner. I've seen it before.
And inside the fan housing i can find remnants of dichromate.
