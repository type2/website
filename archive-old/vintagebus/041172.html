Subject: Bye and Thanks

Welcome back buslist!
Bus and I split for Alaska Wednesday morning, so I thought I'd make
one last post to thank everyone for all the terrific help you've given
me. Thanks everyone, I would have been up Hepatitis Creek on numerous
occasions without you.
We went to the first Motherlode VW show on Saturday in Angel's Camp,
CA. Good showing of buses, the place seemed crawling with 21 windows
and double doors. The swap side was pretty small, but I did manage to
find the driver's side oilbath to carb fitting I was missing.
I did see a bus from SF with a real tricky gauge setup, everything
tucked away neatly into that panel that allows access to the fresh air
vent. But I took a different path, ditching the tach and trusting the
bus. Big surprise, but those little marks VW put on the speedo for
gear change work just fine. It is more than just the tach; if I don't
make myself trust in the bus I will have a worry-filled unhappy
journey. The tach is just the symbol.
After a run up and down highway 49 (all hill, all the time) to Nevada
City and then home the mileage that day came to about 300. Damn good
bus didn't complain once, so I have to say she's ready to go.
Not quite!
Leaky right redux box: just a little and I so want to ignore it.
Better do it now while I have access to the big sockets rather than
fight with the whacker tool on the road when it starts leaking worse.
Or maybe I can just fill it up with Thom's steering box stop leak
potion and pretend I don't know anything about any leak at all...
Splash pan: need to extract the busted bolts from half the holes and
tap new threads in the other half. I should say goodbye to the skin on
my knuckles now while I have the chance. Rear window: still haven't
installed it. I tried once and failed, didn't have the seal far enough
onto the glass, I think.
Drag link: I tore up the old boot real good with the pickle fork
during the adjustment phase, I'll tear it up some more removing it and
try to put the new one in at just the right length. Yes I know there
is a better tool, if you lived in Hood I would have asked to borrow
it.
Spare tire: I need to find a cheap 205/70/15 so I can get rid of the
&quot;For Trailer Use Only&quot; monster or the Kelly-Springfield 6.0x15 of
ancient and unknown origin that I have right now. The trailer tire is
too big, the 6.0x15 is too small but at least fits behind the bench
seat. Wrong, but I am trying to remedy it.
Let's see how many of these I actually get to. I could end up doing a
lot of wrenching at the rest areas. I am sure I am not the first.
Wipers, heater cables, hazard lights and whatever else I've forgotten
(door panels, engine lock, preheat hose, squeaky speedo cable...) I
can definitely do on the road. I ran out of time and money (not in
quite in that order) long before getting to any kind of body work or
rubber seal stage of the game, so I am sure this bus will be a leaker.
Caulk gun, tube of roofing tar and a couple rolls of weatherstripping
are coming with. Winter clothes too. Poncho? I haven't been rained on
in the bus yet. If that nice fresh air vent doesn't seal out air it
probably won't seal out water either, huh?
But whatever happens will, and I intend to enjoy it all irrespective
of whether I planned it or not. Thanks everyone and I hope you have a
great rest of the summer. Keep them buses rolling.
