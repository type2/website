Oh ya!

I wanted to put in my two cents about paint stripper chemicals.  3M's
&quot;Safest Stripper&quot; is good if you have time, and the temperature is cooler.
It is nice because it only takes off a layer at a time, which can be perfect
for what I wish we had only done.  However...if you want to take off a bit
more (duh duh dun da dant!) the Citrustrip stuff is actually quite nice.  It
does the job well, doesn't dry out too fast, and doesn't send Michele inside
saying &quot;ow ow ow&quot; after accidentally sitting on Jasco...as a matter of fact,
all it did to my hands was to prematurely age them, but that went away.
Plus it has this nice orangey scent!

Gene
