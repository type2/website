After my &quot;tranny woes&quot; post, and all the helpful replies, I got to the heart
of the matter today.  The t/o bearing was hanging on the drive shaft in
pieces, the clips were lying on the bell housing bottom, and there is a
considerable amount of wear on the release levers....where the release plate
used to live....now I know what that funny sound was!

        golly

I'll be spending a bit of time after I install the new clutch assembly,
engine front seal, tranny rear seal, and t/o bearing to clean up the engine
compartment, replace the axle boots, and address general yechiness that is
easier to deal with  the engine out.  I have a feeling that it will be
coming back out relatively soon anyway, because the drive shaft of the
tranny seems to move around quite a bit.  Oh well, it only took an hour and
a half to get it out.....I'll get faster with practice!

Now....how long does it take Gene to replace the clutch assembly properly?

Later,

Gene
