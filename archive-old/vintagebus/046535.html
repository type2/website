I've got several friends with 4X4's that use the Rhino Liner to coat the
rockers, bottoms of the fenders and entire underside to protect against
rock/skid damage.  That stuff is bulletproof!!  Was it expensive to have
your bus done??

My body guy changed my mind when he got involved.  He knocked
the residue from the zinc phosphor coating off with powder blast and
coated with Rhino Liner, outside and inside floor.  I was a little
skeptic
at first, but I was convinced after seeing the results.

POR15 if your patching, Rhino liner if your rebuilding, IMHO.
