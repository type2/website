Subject: Fuel gauge ideas?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Here's what I need help with-
I have a 59' panel that originally didn't come w/ a fuel gauge. The gas tank 
is original and doesn't have a sender. I'd really like to be able to tell how 
much gas I have! What are my options? I have a 6v gauge in my parts stash 
that i'd like to use on a 12v system. Is that possible? Also, Is there a 
sender I could use w/ out cutting the tank?
Do any of you drive w/ out a gauge? I don't have a reserve tap? 
All your ideas and help are really appreciated!

BTW, I need a really nice pair of original VW windshields for the 59' as well!

Thanks alot everyone!
-Pete
