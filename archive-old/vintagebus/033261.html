The Muir book gives a pretty good going over to the whole steering box tie
rod drag link pivot pin deal . Read it and try all the stuff he says. I
replaced my Steering box
(bad worm gear) and when i pulled it down found the drag link to be bad. I
know that
some people might not agree with this advice but sometimes you just gotta go
at it (tear it apart) to find all the problems when they get this old.
