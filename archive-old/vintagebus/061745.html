&gt; Looking for info here.
&gt; 1.Is it true that a double cab truck has no 'treasure chest' under the bed?  It appears the rear bench would be in the way, but did any years have a small place to stash stuff?

Yes this is true. Instead stuff gets stashed under the rear seat back to the gas tank divider wall.

&gt; 2. Is there a double cab-specific roof rack available or do dc owners just adapt standard racks?

I use a Westy rack or an early 1/2

&gt; 3. What is the deal with the metal around the DC rear window?  kinda looks like 4 triangle stamps in the metal coming to a point.  Is this finding a  factory marking or some custom crap?

Stock, same thing on the Single Cabs

&gt; 4. Are safari windows any better than they were 10 yrs ago? When the repros came out, everyone complained about them cracking if you drive with them even slightly open.  Are there any good ones available today? When closed, is leaking a problem in the rain?

Yes, yes, and yes.

&gt; 5. Does anyone have a nice 58-61 double cab they would like to sell to a good home?

Doubtful

Greg
