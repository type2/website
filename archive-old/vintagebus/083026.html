Subject: Cool tin?

I'm doing a quick, partial top end rebuild on an older 1600.  Keeping the
old heads, (they look OK after cleanup), but replacing worn pistons and
cylinders.  I finally unpacked my set of 'cool tin', and am putting them in
place of the under-cylinder deflectors.  Before it is too late, does anyone
have any experience with this 'cool tin'?  The pistons I am replacing were
dished, btw, and the new ones are flat.  I know my CR will be higher, but
haven't really done the math.

This is a quick semi-overhaul to get me more power than the engine currently
in my DC, so I can take a load of stuff from my old house near the coast to
my new house in Sierra City.  It is approximately 300 miles.  Not a whole
lot of freeway, but some interesting hills.  I will likely be leaving the DC
at the new place, so all I really have to do is make it there.

I have an oil temp guage with a sump sender.  Will be doing the dipstick
feel test and spit test also.

Thanks in advance for any thoughts!
