Subject: Re: [VB] INSURANCE/collector car

how is pollmans about milage/use restrictions? do they insure your campers?
i'm with haggerty now, but they don't like campers, and i'm looking for one.

&gt;   I have 4 buses with Farmers and pay 165 every 6 months for liability
only. When I move a couple over to Pollmans
&gt; they will cost 100 for the first bus and 75 for the second, PER YEAR, full
coverage, stated value! My wifes 65 bug is 100
&gt; per year 8000 dollars stated value, modified vehicle and the oval 75
dollars 10K stated value, modified.
&gt;    The deal is you have to have other daily drivers insured as primary. I
have the tow ford and my wife has the PT as
&gt; our primary
