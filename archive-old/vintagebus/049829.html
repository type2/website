Subject: RE: [VB] tool source

&gt;I usually buy Craftsman. Good selection, reasonable price and a guarantee
&gt;you can not beat.
&gt;
&gt;The best tool I ever bought came from Sears. A 8 ton floor jack. I went
&gt;for the best one because I did not plan to ever buy another and there was
&gt;some money. Now thirty years later (dated aren't I?) it needs a rebuild
&gt;and I still haven't been billed for that particular card purchase.


Another advantage to Sears stuff is that you can often buy parts for the
stuff they sell.  I once bought some parts at Sears for a Taiwan jack I had
bought elsewhere, but Sears was selling one which was almost identical, so
I ordered the parts at Sears.

I suggest that you see if Sears will sell you the parts to rebuild your jack.
