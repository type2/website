&gt;Can anyone identify these single can gate latch part numbers?
&gt;
&gt;261 829 451/452 2 slight bend in outer portion
&gt;251 829 451/452

I vaguely recall something about one truck model having a different
bend in the latch as you describe for the first part above.  Wade at
dropgates_dot_com might have better information.  The parts manual at
http://wow.atlasta_dot_net/~mriluvu/oacdp/5867part.html , pages 423 and
431, has

261 829 447    front female both sides
261 829 453    front left male
261 829 454 B  front right male

261 829 445    rear female both sides
261 829 473    rear left male
261 829 474    rear right male

The supplements in the front of the book don't help much.  Page 21
does mention that the 454 B supersedes 454.

If I had to guess, I'd say the 451 / 452 were earlier part numbers
that were superseded to the 453 / 454, but I'm not sure.

A 251 part would be for a Samba.  I don't think they made Samba
pick-ups...

&gt;26A 330 143
&gt;201 82D 402 2
&gt;25A 300 143/144 2   Crazy PN, but that's what's on it

I have noticed that once VW started putting radiators in their cars,
the fumes from the coolant made them put letters in funny places in
the part numbers.  In other words, these may well be Vanagon parts.
I don't know if VW ever sold them in the US, but Vanagon single and
double cabs were sold in Germany.  The one or two I've seen had
latches that look somewhat like the splitty ones, but I've never had
two in the same place at once to compare.
