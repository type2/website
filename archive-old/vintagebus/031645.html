Subject: [VB] Keeping my bus warm.


I've decided to go ahead and post a message once in a while to the bus list.
I'm still having a &quot;message hunger strike&quot; to protest the archive fiasco but
moving right along.

My bus runs too cool in the winter.  Matter of fact, it hasn't seen 180
degrees running oil temp since last October.  It's only seen 125 degrees
once for about 50 miles.

This weekend I'm headed to Topeka to Rick Taylor's bus farm and in trying to
keep my bus warm, I hacked together a little something that might work.
Since I can't adjust the thermostat due to the Berg sump being in the way, I
took 2 sheets of wood backed bathroom paneling and drilled 8 holes in each
piece.  Each piece measures 12 inches by 13.5 inches.  I put some single
sticky sided foam tape around the edge of the paneling and wire tied each of
these covers over my air vents on either side of the bus in effect sealing
them off.  I still have that louvered decklid on the back and am missing the
bottom seal so I still have some air flow back there.  Now I can watch my
oil temps and if they start to climb into critical, I can always take the
side cutters, remove one of my panels and increase the airflow to the
engine.

I'll let you all know how it works.  So far, the trip home from work didn't
register anything majorly different however, I noticed a little more oil
leakage, presumably due to the increased vaccuum created in the engine
compartment now.
