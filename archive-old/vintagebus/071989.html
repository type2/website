It'll take a day for you and a friend to do both, without rushing.  some 
stuff it helped to have a second pair of hands, but often it was one person.   
Dunno what a shop would charge.

Look in the archives for  a write up of this being done to my dad's 63 SC.  
It went really smoothly.  the suspension was so bad in that w/ springs removed 
a bump would send you up to hit your head on the ceiling.   Ow!!!!   the seat 
was ratty ( has since been recovered) so then you bounced back on the springs 
and inadequate horsehair, potentially puncturing your backside.  Owww!!!!   
The rear had been lowered by turning the splines, so they got turned back to 
stock position.

................................................
 Latest in the constant string of bunk-a$$ volks-knowledge I've been getting 
from the DPO of the '65 standard is the admission that he had the front 
lowered (torsion spring removal) because the back looked low.
 
 HHHMMPHH.
 
 (snip)
 Well, I know the shop that did it, and I'm gonna hit him up to do the work 
and not charge me for parts since he probably has my originals there.
 
 How many hours of labor should I expect for this job? From a professional.
 
 Could you all please comment on time required to adjust the rears also? I'd 
like to put the bus back to stock ride height/suspension quality.
 
 Tired of the wife refering to the bus as a lowrider/hoopty and grinding my 
steering box off on the driveway.
