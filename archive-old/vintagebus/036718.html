Hi list,

It seems that the run of good bus luck I described in my previous post may
be continuing.

I just got a call from a buddy who found what sounds like a barndoor on a
farm nearby while he was doing a water tank repair.

He knows my '60 doublecab fairly well and we have discussed it at length so
he has a better than average knowledge of split buses. For this reason his
description of the find has got me a little excited to say the least. He
says that the bus in question does not have a ventilation lip above the
screens and that it has a dash that is completely different to mine. It also
has a sunroof hole with a(tattered) fabric cover. 

He says that the owner bought the farm with the bus in the barn/shed 15
years ago and that it has never been run while he has owned the place.

Now for the potentially good bit. The owner says that we can go in and haul
it away as long as we clean out the the rest of the crap in the shed at the
same time! My budddy has a two ton double axle trailer which he says will
swallow the contents of the shed(including the bus) in two loads. The farm
is situated no more that 10 miles from a large landfill dump where there is
no charge for loads of a ton or less. 

I am going out there tomorrow afternoon to see if it is what I hope it is.
You can bet that I will report back if it is. 

Later

Michael 'no sleep tonight' Evans
