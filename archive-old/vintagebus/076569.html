Subject: Oil leak at Oil Pump cover

My newly rebuilt engine is running so smooth now after all the oil it was
built up with. I coated the cyls., etc. with oil to make sure it wasn't dry.
I cranked it over without starting it for at least a minute with oil light
gone out. Then I plugged in the coil to distributor cap and it fired right
up. Boy did it run rough and smoke a whole lot. After replacing fouled plugs
it is smooth and sweet. An oil leak developed at the oil pump cover. I
pulled it and the skinny little O-ring was out of its groove and smashed. I
will need to replace it tomorrow. The generator light is on. The voltmeter
is showing that it is not charging either. I'll have to think about this one
a little more to figure out how to trouble shoot it. One thing at a time.
Any suggestions would be appreciated. You guys are a big help. Thanks in
advance.
Dave
