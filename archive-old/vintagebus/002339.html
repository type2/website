Hi all,

Does anyone know if early Porsche brakes will bolt onto an early bus????
I'm putting a WW rear lowering kit on my 59 dc and have been planning on
using a set of type 3 backing plates and drums I have but I just got
thinking whether or not the Porsche brakes would also work... It would be
more in line with the vintage speed theme I'm working on.

Anyone know where I can find a set of al-fins?  I think I'm willing to pay!

Anybody???

Thanks

David
