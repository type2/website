Subject: Re: [VB] block heaters

I haven't seen any for Air Cooled VW's but all they are is a heating 
element (like an electric stove or heating plate) which warms the oil. I 
am familiar with the ones which bolt on to the sump plate. There is 
usually a little plug that hangs down a bit, you can fasten it to the 
bumper. As far as how well they work, they work great! They make 
starting a car under 10F as easy as at 65F. I would say they definately 
decrease engine wear during cold weather. A/C VW's however have small 
oil capacities and are designed to warm up quickly which is why they are 
not seen too often. No reason why you couldn't have one though. A few 
things come to mind:
- if you could find one with an adjustable thermostat that would be 
ideal, set it to say 180F
- if you can't find one with an adjustable thermostat, make sure the 
unit you has as some sort of thermostat. After hooking it up, measure 
the oil temperature with a meat thermoter to see what temp it keeps your 
oil at. Any unit you find will have enough wattage to keep the oil at 
that temperature regardless of ambient temperature.
- if you are running a thermostat and flaps, make sure the block heater 
doesn't throw off too much heat and trigger the thermostat to go off ( 
unlikely but worth noting )
- most important - Have some sort of &quot;technology&quot; to remind you to 
unplug the cord! ( Big sign on dash , flashing light etc ). Also, 
fastern the cord to a building so if you do drive off things will just 
unplug, and use good cord.
