There is no &quot;adjustment left in&quot; when it comes to steering boxes; when they
get to the point where you're monkeying with it, it's a sign from The Great Bob
that you need to get it rebuilt...

&gt;     I have  a loose steering box that has seen better days. I have found a
&gt; used 65 steering box with some adjustment left in it.
&gt; What I want to know is there anything different with this box from my 67
&gt; box. Any information is appreciated!
&gt; The number on the 65 steering box is 211 415 151A.
