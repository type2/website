-Like we said we put 100,000 miles on
&gt;our bus every 5 years and that is when you can start to say if things work
or
&gt;not.     Eric &amp; Barb

That seems like a good minimal number for rear wheel bearings to me.
If you wear them out faster than that you need to probably consider a
different vehicle for your job.  It always amazed me how strong the busses
are though.  I started a business in about 1983 that involved driving all
over the Rocky Mtn. states carrying about 1/2 ton of stuff all the time.
When I started I had a 67 Westy.  It did the job great, but after some
discouraging trans repairs in Mesa Az.  and wondering about getting parts
when stuck in Gallup or somewhere I decided to get a Ch*vy 1/2 ton van.
Ended up I would get stuck somewhere chewing a bearing and axle (GM too
cheap to put an inner race on the bearing) every 30K.  That may not seem
that bad, but that's about every 9 months stuck somewhere when you need to
be making money.  The loaded surface (upper area) of the bearing was always
ovaled out.  When the load gets to big for the surface it's loaded on, metal
starts to move.  I've decided since then to always over-rate the vehicle for
the job if it's going to be a work vehicle.  64-67 buses are really sturdy
things though.  They may be underpowered, but they seem to have a well
designed chassis.
I guess &quot;Everywhere Ed&quot;  has no problem putting over a ton in one and going
cross country.:)
BTW- saw Ed the other night with his &quot;double cab&quot; .  This guy is amazing at
finding the most exotic hack jobs ever seen.  It's a great hauler, used to
be
a bus, now made into double cab, with a big wide stake bed ready to haul
thousands of pounds of oily vw parts.  See it at JEROME filled with parts
along with more parts from SWUN!
I want to see Rusty's new barndoor there too.
