&gt; My understanding is the underdash models were meant

&gt; the rear mounted style.

That's an interesting point, because there are two
doublecabs here in my shop.  Barry's '63 has the
underdash unit (he just got it running, so no reports
from passengers yet), and my '61 DC had a heater in
the engine compartment w/ factory holes in the gas
tank bulkhead piece and the rear seat stand for
ductwork.  His bus has a steel gas line running from
the rear to feed the heater.  Were the under-dash
units dealer installed, maybe?  I can't believe that
the heater tube from the rear would take up that much
space in the &quot;air tight water proof lower compartment&quot;
of singlecabs.  My new '57 singlecab seems to have a
cavernous &quot;treasure chest&quot; area.
