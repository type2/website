Subject: A weeks worth of PMAIL....

Wow! I just returned from a week's long business trip where I hadn't been able
to read my P-MAIL. What a brain dump! I felt that reading complete threads at
one time gave me quite a different perspective than reading them as they are
posted. At any rate I wanted to first thank everyone that responded to my
request for any VW happenings with the show in Pleasanton on the 15th. Jim and
I will be there and I hope that I run into some of you there. Also, Gary
LaVere do you plan on setting up a booth there? I want to get that hatch
repair kit we talked about. If not I will hunt you down at your shop.

FYI. The Bus Depot www.busdepot_dot_com is just a stones through from my house. I
stopped in to check them out and they are good people. Jim and I ordered some
brake parts from them and I snaged two of the early bus tail-light assemblies.
Good quality and good price!

Well renovations have begun on our &quot;new&quot; 64 camper. Jim and I have begun
pulling out the interior and fortunately have found very few surprises. Anyone
who feels that husbands and wives should share a hobby have obviously never
attempted to restore a splitty with his or her significant other. The first
battle is over, Jim has won! I was in favor of belt sanding the cabinets down
to bare wood and doing a showroom fresh resto. Jim insisted on a light sand to
remove watermarks and a fresh coat of varnish. I felt that the resto shouldn't
have &quot;beat up&quot; cabinets Jim thought a little age was more dignified. The
argument ended when he reminded me that I am always dragging him into antique
shops to buy stuff for the house so why should the interior of the camper be
any different. I had future visions of us driving PAST interesting looking
antique shops in the fully restored camper while Jim reminded me that I didn't
&quot;like old beat up things&quot; I shut up and must admit that the cabinets are
turning out nicely. Our next challenge is to find a good stain color. I
imagine that the interior was originally natural and has darkened with age.
Since we are going with the darkened finish, we will need to match it for the
few doors that have to be reproduced and the headliner.

As far as hardware and plastic parts, thanks for the lead on the Outwater
plastics company (www.outwater_dot_com), I sent away for it and feel that it
should be a standard volume for any bus enthusiast.

I am considering getting Eastwood's (www.eastwoodco_dot_com) brass plating kit to
replate my cabinet hinges has anyone done this? Please advise.

I would also like the lists opinion on another matter. Our 64 has grey
pressboard in the front cabin. The camper section is all birch except for the
two door panels. The left has the fold down shelf and the right has the toilet
cabinet. the panels here are white pressboard. Jim thinks it would look better
with birch plywood like the rest of the camper interior. I agree but am afraid
that if we ever show the camper we will be slammed by the judges for not
restoring the white pressboard. We have a 63 camper catalog that shows these
panels as birch and not white for that year. What do you all think?

I would also like to comment on a couple of  threads.

1) lowered, chopped, frenched etc. Personally I would never do it! I like the
original automobile too much. But I must admit I do admire the Cal looks,
customs and retro customs that I see in Hot VW sometimes. I would like to
suggest a volunteer guideline based on the the Hippocratic Oath. &quot;Above all do
no harm&quot; If you go out and find a factory mint early VW in a California Barn?
( Are there Barns in California?) and decide that you want to turn it into a
custom chopped rod, the entire list should decend upon your house like a
plague of locusts and wrestle the keys and title out of your hands! However if
you fish a shell of a bus out of a swamp in the Mississippi delta and figure
that if you tried to restore it to factory condition it literally be worth
$53,000 not to mention taking out three other VWs so that yours may live, chop
away! I personally would love to see a Frenched British Racing green splittie
with a leather captains chairs, cherry cabinets, oriental carpets and a
Crystal Chandeler. (Sounds like what Martha Stewart would own if she were into
VWs)!

2) Full circle to Nazism? What are you smoking in your hippie bus? While it is
true that you can not deny Volkswagen Corporations link to Nazi Germany, not
to mention the slave labor, etc. Hitlers only contributions were original
vision for the VW was a car for every man, provided of course that that man
was a member of the &quot;master race&quot; and money. The notion of a simple and
timeless design, functional beauty etc. was not a credit to Hitler, but a
credit to the German engineers that designed the first VWs. Calling our
beloved VW a Nazi car is like calling Neil Armstrong a Nazi just because he
rode to the moon in a technology originally engineered by scientists working
for the Nazis. Anyway, the VWs that we know and love were made after the mid
1940s when VW was being run by appointees from the allied occupation. Not to
mention the fact that the real Nazis not the German army grunts but the SS
officers and their like drove around in Mercedes anyway. Hmmm.. maybe I should
get rid of Late Model Luxury Car (LMLC). 

At any rate hope to see some of your next weekend ITRW!
