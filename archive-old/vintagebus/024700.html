Subject: RE: Winter Considerations?

Brayden,

I'm going to differ with Clara on the subject of motor oil (although she
doesn't say how cold is cold in Oly). When I used to encounter -20C (-4F
if my conversion's correct) I would change to 5w-20 motor oil. I'm not
finding official VW specs, but one book says 10w oil for +20C down to
-30C (SAE 80w for the trans) and 30w for 0C through 40C (SAE 90w in
trans). I've never changed trans lube for seasonal temp changes.

It's been said before, but make sure your battery and cables are in
tip-top shape. I would also take a battery charger and a light bulb
setup that you can plug in at your destination to warm the battery and
engine oil before starting... but that's me. -4F is not really too
extreme, so if it's starting well you will probably be fine without
external heat.

Make sure ignition system is up to snuff as well, you want it to start
easy.

Oh, yeah, dress warm! I _always_ have warm boots &amp; clothes and extra
food with me on winter road trips... I don't care what make of car I'm
driving. If you get stuck/stalled/wrecked you could die of hypothermia
before you get far from your car. I know that sounds dire, but you've
got all that space in the Bus, it doesn't hurt to pack the stuff (maybe
you'll save some other poor, stuck soul).

pd

BTW: we've got the arctic air in Utah right now too... supposed to be
-3F tonight, highs in the teens... I love it! Now if we'd get some snow!

&gt; cold weather...seems that some arctic air slipped down into the Vancouver
&gt; area and everything is good and frozen...I had some minor electrical
&gt; difficulties tonight (turnsignals stopped working for a little while -SNIP-
&gt; was so cold I guess)..  *shrugs*  any thoughts on that?  Any other general
&gt; considerations?  
&gt; 
-SNIP- 
&gt; installed, so I should be okay as far as that goes...but it'll be -20C when
&gt; I get there (with no garage or block heater)..   Any help is always
&gt; appreciated :)  many thanks..
&gt;
