Subject: '66 Kombi F/S

Local yard here has a number of busses that are very restorable.  I
was down looking for some door bolts for the '65 and had a good look
around.  Lot's of cool stuff for the restorer.

The best one is a '66 Kombi.  Pretty straight except for the passenger
side rear corner is crumpled about half way down.  Runs, windows are
out, in a WCM box in the rear.  No serious cancer, just surface crumble.
Pretty good restoration project.  Oh yeah, VOA elephants.
He wants $800.

If anyone is interested, I can give you his shop number. He's a good one 
to put in the rolodex for parts anyway.  Never can tell when you might
need something hes got.
