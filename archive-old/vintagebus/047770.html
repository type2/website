&lt;&lt; Instead of running those expensive stock splitty wipers, this
  opens up a world of cheaper, more available bug parts one could use -&gt;&gt;

Dear Spy (and the List),

I thot I did too.  Jeep.  11&quot; blades for a flat windscreen. (9&quot;?  Onna those) 
 Get'um from JCW (or others).  About three bux.  Cheep.  (But... you gotta 
change the arm, too.  Not the whole arm, just the rod that holds the blade.  
JCW gots them too.  About twenny bux (for the whole arm).  &quot;Manual Wiper Arm&quot; 
 Tellum it's fer your boat :-)

Or mebbe I didn't post it.  Or posted it privately.  Or to the Vanagon list, 
or as part of the Get-Ready-List for the Inuvik run... or some damn thing.  
But it works.  And once you got a lock on a life-time supply of cheap wiper 
blades, universally available ( &quot;I gotta old Jeep... you gotta wiper for it?&quot; 
) you tend to forget other folks might still be paying $20 for a Genyewwhine 
Bosch Viper Blate.

(Did I ever tell you about the time I safety-wired the wipers on my '57?  No? 
 Well... One time I safety some wipers on my '57 bus.  [I don't know what 
they wuz offa.  Mebbe a bug.  Mebbe not.]  Worked.  Ugly, but it worked.  For 
a while.  You gotta drill a coupla holes in the wiper blade, one in the arm.  
Usa x-looking pattern.  028 wire.  Lasts about fifty miles.  Then you do it 
again, if you stop before it falls off.  Eventually, it falls off.  Then you 
start looking at farm machinery an mail trucks and jeeps and anything else 
with flat windscreens.  Keep looking, eventually the rain will stop :-)

Whatever works :-)
