Hi all,

I'm trying to remove the e brake handle from my 59 with no luck.  I've
removed the two C clips on both sides of the pin but the pin wont budge
either way inside the pivot tube on the bottom of the handle.  It does slide
back and forth 1 mm or so in the bracket connected to the chassis.  I've
tried to heat it with a small pen torch but I don't think I'm getting enough
heat to it.  Any thoughts?

TIA

David
