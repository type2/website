I recently wrote about CAMPMOR as a good source for tent and awning poles,
etc. [See below]

After doing some cross-checking I've found that the online catalog has far
fewer of these items than the printed catalog.  I assumed that the listings
would be the same, but they're not.

The current printed CAMPMOR catalog has ~3 pages of repair and/or
replacement tent poles and fittings, some generic and some intended for
specific makes and models of tents.  All have pole lengths, diameter, etc.
listed so you can engineer your own solution for rigging a tent or tarp
setup for your Type 2.

Sorry for any confusion.  I'm always admonishing folks not to assume
anything, but that's just what I did regarding the online catalog.

&gt;&gt;  One source of individual tent poles of various sizes and types is
CAMPMOR.
Their online catalog is at:    www_dot_campmor_dot_com

Especially if you are rigging or modifying a non-Westfalia tent, or putting
together an awning or tarp setup, most of your needs are available at
CAMPMOR.  I'm not aware of any other outlet that sells individual bits and
pieces like they do, although companies like Coleman and Eureka can supply
individual parts for specific tent models they've sold.  &lt;&lt;
