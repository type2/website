Subject: bus on the highway

I am glad to see that Dawn and crew came out of this alivew

One thing buses need are larger rear lights, look at barndoor and later 50s 
tailights , 
how far can you really see them ?
and if you are going 50mph and the trucker 70-80mph , well by ther time he 
sees your lights its too late......

Someone needs to make some cool looking , bright accessory lights that can be 
mounted  / un-mounted easily for highway use , maybe even mounted to the roof 
rack

There is no way to say if better lights would have prevented it , but better 
lights might prevent the next one.....

PS.....even just cleaning the grounds will give brighter lights.......

Drive safely.....
