I sent a message to Bentley and received the attached reply;
now he's interested in finding out how large of a market there is
for this manual.  I forwarded him some stats from the registry - 
(see? It pays to have some documentation on all these buses! Add yours
today!  http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/regsitry)

Is there any way to wrest some stats out of the NEATO registry?

Thank you for your interest in Bentley Publishers. I too have recently
received a number of requests to reprint the pre-1963 Type 2 service manual.
I have forwarded all of these requests onto both our technical and editorial
staff. One of our editors has asked if you, or any of your colleagues, might
know how many of these pre-1963 Type 2's are currently on the road. We're
familiar with NEATO and SOTO bus clubs but we're not quite sure if they, or
you, have a registry of these vehicles. Knowing the number of buses out
there would really help us in making a printing decision. Any information
you might be able to supply would be greatly appreciated.

As always, please feel free to contact us if you have any further questions.
