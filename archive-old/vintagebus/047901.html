Hey Clara,

 Can this technique be used to remove mirror hinge pins?
 Or should I so something else.
-  --  -
heat cold shock treatment is very useful.  Of course, it will damage paint and
I try to avoid it on places I will see the burned paint like mirror hinge
pins.   try penetrating oil.   for a few days before removing the old pin.
then undo the nuts till it is flush with the bottoom of the bolt.  use vise
grips (w rag if you want to avoid messing the mirror stalk) to twist it.
wiggle it up and out if possible.  Tap from underneath with a hammer if
wiggling dont work.   If it is the original round topped pin the vise grips
dont work and it is a PITA but still possible.  My 61 had no mirroes when I
got it- both sides the round topped pins.  now has a mirroe on the driver's
side.    Ve haf our vays of pursvuading ze pins to go avay.
