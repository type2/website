I went looking through the archives for info on tires and came up more
confused than before I started.  Is there anyone out there who has recently
bought tires that can pass along their findings?  I'm looking for 205 75 14s
with the thin whitewalls for my 63 DC.  I have regular passenger tires on it
now.  How important is 8 ply?  The single plys have worked fine for at least
2 years (the length of time that I've owned it).  I'm trying to get ready
for OCTO this weekend.  Any central Cali people going down?  I'm planning on
leaving the morning of the 10th.  How about directions to the campout at
Dustin's?  Anyone got directions?  See some of ya'll there,
