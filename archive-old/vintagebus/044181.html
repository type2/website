So I'm driving down the road last night about 9:45 pm (dark) and I decide to try to switch on my high beam headlights, as i flip the switch I lose the headlights completely!!  When I hold the the switch toward me and not release it I can get the lights to work sporadically.  So, does this sound like a switch problem (my first guess), an electrical wiring problem (it wouldn't be surprising seeing some of the other electrical things done by the PO), or just that the high beam setting on both my headlights is out (it couldn't really be that simple could it?!?!?)
