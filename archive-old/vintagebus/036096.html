Subject: 66 Bus - What Should I Check Before Trip?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Forgot to ask in my previous message. I'll be driving this 66 bus I'm buying 
next Friday in VT about 125 miles to its temporary home in another part of 
VT. Don't want to make the drive to NJ all at once. The 125 miles is typical 
VT stuff--up and down hills.

I took the bus for a short ride before I bought it, but I wondered what I 
should check before making the longer drive next Friday. I know oil, but what 
else? Fuel hoses? Any help mucho appreciated.
