  I just traded a 71 bus(no engine &amp; a little rusty)for a '59 panel with 
a 307ci chevy v8!! wow!! its mounted mid engine with an automatic 
and old style (50's)chevy rearend welded to the springplates the 
driveline is routed under the tortion housing and surprisingly the 
bus is'nt really that hacked up ..just about a 2x4 foot hole cut into 
the center of the cargo floor and the trans. horns have been 
removed. ._dot_california cut outs and alater model nose has been 
spliced in...sad thing about it is that its almost rust free and totally 
straight..

what should I do with this thing???any suggestions? cut it up for 
parts ??put it back to stock??is it worth the effort?I'm into it for 
nothing since the '71 was free
