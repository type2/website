Okay everyone - here's the latest scoop on this engine fiasco.

The engine that I converted from a t3 to t1 was a running engine when I got
it.  I was told this but never heard it run.

Now that everything is assembled and being tested - the troubles are coming
to the surface (which is expected.)

I haven't yet ruled out that the carb on the 1 and 2 side isn't the problem
but I do know the accelerator pumps on all 4 barrels are working.  Also,
spraying starting fluid down the 1 and 2 sides while the engine is idling
doesn't seem to change any thing.  I really think the engine is running on
the 3 and 4 side alone.  I'm also beginning to believe my compression guage
that tells me I've only got 70 to 80 psi on 1, 2, and 3.  I've got 120 on
#4 - go figure.  I'm gonna take another compression reading tonight and see
what I get.

Now another thing I should mention.  Way back this summer, I yanked the
heads and put them back on.  While they were off, I cleaned up the carbon
deposits in them (supposedly they had 1000 miles on the rebuild).  The
carbon was basically a layer of powery black soot which looked like the
engine had run rich - not entirely a bad thing.  Everything else looked
clean.  Without using any sealant, gaskets, etc. I put the heads back on and
torqued them.  When they came off there was nothing so I figured that
putting them back on didn't require anything.  I cleaned up the mating
surfaces as best as I could and torqued everything to spec.

If this alone shouldn't have caused the problem.  If it's the rings, then
why am I not burning oil at all?  Shouldn't I see a lot of blue smoke?  If
anything right now, I'm running lean by the sounds of the carbs popping and
backfiring occasionally.

So here's my options:

Run a dry and wet compression check and compare figures.  If I gain
compression under a wet check - undoubtedly bad rings and then I'll just do
a light rebuild - new P/C's etc.

If it proves to be valves, then I'll get my heads rebuilt.

If the whole thing has gone to hell, I can run the 2161 Berg engine.

Or I have this AS21 case and $1300 Berg crank for a 2213 engine that I could
build.  I just don't like putting that kind of power in the rear of bus due
to cooling problems and the tranny not being built to withstand that kind of
torque.

I'll keep you all posted.
