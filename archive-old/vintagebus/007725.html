&gt;The bearings are here, and I will probably put them in at lunchtime
&gt;Monday, but now I'm starting to wonder if I should have ordered the
&gt;upper two bearings also... maybe some seals, too... Any suggestions or
&gt;comments?
&gt;


It's a bird, it's a plane, it's...

Redux bearings during lunchtime? Not unless you work for the highway
department. Your lunch couldn't possibly be long enough. And yes, do the
uppers.
