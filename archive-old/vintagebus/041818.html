&gt; &gt;I know that this is a pretty dumb question, but I'm not sure what kind of tar
&gt; &gt;you're specifying - is this stuff ever available in a caulking gun container?
&gt; 
&gt; no.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;  Should the stuff be located near the &quot;regular&quot; roofing tar and I'm
&gt; &gt;just missing it?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; yes, you will find a gallon can, it's  also real good for undercoat- brush, roller, or spray...

Perhaps a brand name?  I'm thinking of &quot;Pacific&quot; or &quot;Henry's&quot; roof
coatings.  Perhaps &quot;plastic cement&quot; or &quot;wet surface cement&quot;?
