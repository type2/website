OK, OK, OK....... let's not get carried away here......You get $5.00 bonus
only after you confirm your address and bank account. How many bank accounts
do you have???

T-shirt, caps - I think that people would rather buy something knowing that
some of the money went to a good cause instead of just giving money
away........ they want to show something for their money spent...

GUYS and GIRLS!!  you're not throwing money away........ this will all come
back to you one day and I'm sure it will be well worth the investment you
made today....
please, send your donations today so we can continue our love and hate
relationship going.

&gt;
&gt; &gt;I have multiple
&gt; &gt;e-mail addresses. Anyone know if I can set up a separate account for
&gt; &gt;each and forward the bonus money to Ted. This seems like a pyramid
&gt; &gt;scam to constantly refer yourself and then send the money to Ted but
&gt; &gt;if it works.........
