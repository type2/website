I just got back tonight after a two week and 4200
miles road trip in my 67 Sundial to hear the news that
Steve Hansen of Reno Nevada who has driven his 67
Sundial Camper daily for 29 years and 800,000 miles
braked and swerved to miss some wild horses on the
road late at night a couple of days ago, and rolled
his bus and crushed the top pretty good. I don't know
if it will be repairable yet......He is going to try
to buy it back from the insurance company and have it
towed to my property for storage, and hopefully we can
salvage all the running gear(he just had the engine
rebuilt a couple of weeks ago and spent $1650 for the
rebuild)
Oh ya, Steve is OK, a little depressed maybe.
