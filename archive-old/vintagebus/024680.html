Subject: Re: CB Performance problem

Sorry if this is a duplicate, the first one was sent from the wrong
account and was bounced by the list.

&gt; I have just had the most unpleasant experience with a vendor that
&gt; I have had in the whole time I've been working on my bus, more than
&gt; 9 years now.  This comes from CB Performance, Farmersville, CA.

&gt; I wanted to buy a Snakebite Kit and a set of ratio rockers from them.
&gt; They agreed that since I was out of state I didn't need to pay tax on
&gt; the order.  So I placed the order.  The money came out of the
&gt; account.

&gt; Now this morning, I got a message that there was a problem with the
&gt; order.  I called them up to see what was going on, and got the
&gt; bum's rush.  I got that I got to pay the tax on the parts and when I
&gt; protested to that I got the most rude talk that I've ever had by a
public
&gt; business.  It was &quot;God Damn&quot; this and &quot;Son of a Bitch&quot; that.  I even
&gt; spoke to Rick Tomlinson, the owner, and he, even after getting the
&gt; money from my account, cursed me and hung up
&gt; on me.  Before he hung up, he specifically said that the parts were
&gt; on back order.  But not 2 minutes before, his order taker had stated
&gt; that the parts would be at AVP in Sacramento tomorrow.
&gt; I am not aware of why this was done.  I have spent over $8000
&gt; buying parts and services from vendors such as Gene Berg,
&gt; West Coast Metric, and others
&gt; including painters and restorers like Koch's, and Bus Boys.  I have
&gt; tried to use the best parts and services that were available in
&gt; Northern California. This was because I had to rely on the bus
&gt; when it was done, to drive this bus
&gt; back across the country, almost 3000 miles as a shake down cruise.
&gt; All I wanted from this vendor was the parts.  I even offered to go
&gt; ahead and pay the tax, because it was a couple of dollars cheaper
&gt; to do that than ship the parts to Alabama and back to California
&gt; to AVP. What did I do wrong here?  Was I at fault for wanting to
&gt; spend money with this vendor?
&gt; Is this the type of service we can expect from CB Performance?
&gt; Does this make them the SOUP NAZI of the VW world?

Sorry for the lack of snipping, if you look at the addresses, one will
understand the inclusion of the entire original message.

Two things.  The tax is based upon the shipping address, not where the
payment is coming from.  If it were the other way, I could use my
brother-in-law's address in Kentucky and easily avoid that ka-ching if
the 8.25% being added to my purchases.  The guy who took the original
order probably erred and got himself reamed by the boss just before
calling you to let you know that tax would be charged.

This brings me to the second thing.  There is almost no excuse for a
vendor cursing at a customer but we all know that once you received the
news that they made a mistake in not charging you tax,  the following
exchange that you had with them was amicable and pleasant as expected
from a Southern Gentleman with you gently pushing for them not to charge

you the tax, until the sales guy tired of your diplomatic and polite
cajoling and unleashed the barrage of sailor talk that you complain
about.
(wow, I haven't written a run on sentence like that in a long time).
