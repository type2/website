Subject: dead battery/charging problem

Ooops.
Turns out, I left the dome light on in my bus aabout
two weeks ago. So obviously, there was absolutely
nothing when I went out to the garage to start it
today. I tried to jump start it, hooked it up, let it
idel and rev'd it for about three minutes. When I
disconnected the jumper cables. It died.

While it was running, the generator light was on but 
dim, and it did not go out when I reved it. I figured
this was just because the battery in the car was
low/dead and after driving it, it should charge up. 

But every time I disconnect the jumpers, it dies
straight away. No charger either. Not even enough to
light the dome light when the other battery is
disconnected.

So, did having a dead battery totally dying fry the
gen. or something? Would that cause need for
repolarization? The gen was fine before the battery
died, and I'm sure it died beacause I left the dome
light on.

Help
