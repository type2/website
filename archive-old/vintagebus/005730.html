We just have to remember that in some places buses are obsolete. Even if
you'd dig deep underground or in a most remote area you won't find one. So
when they have a bus over there they'd do everything possible to get their
parts or just simply get a bus. I talked to the guy that's selling his '66
in Chicagoland area and he said that he got a lot of people calling on his
bus but were in most part surprised that he wanted $1500.00 for it. They all
were bitching about the price. $1500.00 for a solid Cali bus? So the
interior is shot, big deal. That brings me to the point, we just simply
don't appreciate something until we loose it.

&gt; People will pay more for stuff that's not available locally.  I bought a
&gt; 6-leg, RHD middle seat from Australia.  By the time the thing landed on my
&gt; doorstep, I'd spent $2000.
