  Was going through a box of stuff out of my storage container and found
this dizzy, can anybody enlighting me as to the vintage and any info on this
dizzy?? If I would have won that duel genny stand and with my double genny
pully, the Treuhaft dizzy and Gregs duel carb set-up with cyclone air
cleaners, what a cool set-up.
