&gt;  I know this question came up a while back but I can't remember what the 
&gt; fix
&gt;  was and I havent ever had this problem before. I have a 64 40hp engine and 
a
&gt;  30 pict -1 carb that when installed touches the generator, would a thin
&gt;  spacer fix this and if so where can I get one at? Thanks
&gt;  Brian

are you using a small diameter generator?

yes a spacer under the carb will also fix this
