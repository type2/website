I got a great deal of response on the TRG project. One gentleman from New England shared a story that may interest many of you. Below it is reprinted in total. If you want to contact him send me a p-mail.ncbus wrote:

Hi Chris, 

Thanx for the follow-up. Presently I have 2 '86 Syncros and a '91 Westy 
MV. While I have these late models for the 4WD, power &amp; comfort they 
provide, my heart lies with splittys and loafs. Years ago living in 
California, I always owned several of both and worked for VW dealers. 
Most noteably, I had a '55 window van with a factory center brake light 
on the engine lid and corner windows without the later &quot;Microbus&quot; 
package. I converted it to full 12V and installed a '67 &quot;T&quot; crankcase 
carbureted type III motor. Due to the small gear reduction boxes and a 
'66 tunnel-type transmission, the bus was a &quot;scaulded dog&quot; with WOT in 
the first 3 gears but redlined early. Just as well, as the brakes were 
the orignal size and had real fade at high speed. The top speed in the 
speedometer was an optimsitic 70 but there was an original max cruising 
speed mark at 49 MPH. Under normal driving the type III engine provided 
very good economy &amp; performance over 9 years of camping and exploring 
the mountains of California. In many ways the type III engine and early 
gear reduction boxes were a perfect combination for the mountains! I had 
planned to engineer '71 loaf disc &amp; drum brakes on it when I decided to 
sell it and go with a new '79 loaf for the family. 

You know I've owned numerous vehicles since then but I still miss that 
'55 split as much now as when it rolled out of my driveway for the last 
time. It was like a big faithful dog that always brought us home safely 
and you can never really forget it! 

Regards, John
