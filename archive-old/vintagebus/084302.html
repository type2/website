Subject: BBB

We had both of our buses break down for the BBB event. One had a 
throttle cable break on the way there, the other had the front wheel 
bearing shear the tab on the washer. We rigged the new throttle cable 
(too short, long story) to make it to BBB (2000rpm idle). Needed to get 
one of those adapters to make the cable reach the carb. None available 
at BBB. So I used three key rings looped together and added to the front 
of the cable. That fixed the problem so I could get home to Huntington 
Beach where I know I can find the parts. The other bus broke down on the 
way home, so I drove the &quot;throttle problem&quot; bus back to BBB to see if 
someone had a tabbed washer, no one had one available. So off to NAPA I 
went. The great guy there went out of his way to help me out. He was 
even very interested in the BBB show, and he wasn't even a VW guy. It is 
nice to find someone willing to help like the guy at NAPA in Lake 
Havasu. Aside from the mechanical problems, the campout was a lot of 
fun. I thought the Boy Scouts did a great job at preparing the breakfast 
on Sunday. The slow drags were a laugh.

I look forward to next year.

Rocky
