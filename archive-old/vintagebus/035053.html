I thought the bigger radio hole was for the 67 model year, but find no
refernce to it in the books I have.   For the bigger hole, the same size radio
(but 12V) is used, but there is a separate plate that goes under the dash
between the radio and dash, and a different top cover plate.     I have a
under dash plate that I'd part with if someone wants it for their 67 bus (big
hole type dash)

was writ:

'67 was a one year only dash, and the radio opening is larger than earlier
years.  So it will fit, there just might be some daylight around it.

I did see yesterday a '67 Sundial Camper with no backup lights and an earlier
dash opening. ????  Guess it was an EARLY '67.

I have a 67 Sundial (with back up lights) with a production date of
Aug 66, and I have had a couple of people mention that I have the
'small' early dash hole. My bus is all original. 
Maybe someone knows just what are the dimension of the radio cutout
holes by years ?
I'm asking for the info because I am looking for an original AM/FM
Saphire radio for my 67 camper.
Thanks for the help
Chuck
