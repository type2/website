to the best of my knowledge nobody is reproducing tent poles for ~1966-&gt; westy
tents. Take a good look at joe clark's excellent site www.supernet_dot_net/~jclark
and click on the facist link. lotsa of westy (and other) tents are mentioned
and described in minute detail.

fwiw i have heard of other people making their own tent poles outta
commercially avaialalbe poles and then fitting to size. you would definately
have to have some time on your hands.

i guess you gotta ask yourself are you primarily concerned w/ aesthetics or
functionality (member those old canvas tents wigh a tonne and the steel poles
that vw provided were vastly stronger than much on the markets these days

I have a 1967 Westy. I would like to get a tent for the side. Does anyone
sell the tent poles? I could always have the canvas made, but I at least
need the poles.  Does someone sell a complete kit?

Any information would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks
