Hello,

I know this is not directly related to the vanagon but I thought I would
throw this up here.  I have a trans and reduction boxes (still in one
piece) from a 62; 23 window bus.  These parts are still fully
functional, but if they were going into a resto they might want to be
rebuilt.  So, if you are interested, drop me a line, or if you have an
opinion on what this is worth drop me a line.  Thanks, as I am in need
of a bit of extra cash and don't know what the value of this is.

Thanks
John Dorn
