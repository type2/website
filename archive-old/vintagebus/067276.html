Subject: thanks and another question

Hi list
Many thanks to all who replyed to my guestion about original split window bus
owners. I guess, sadly,  their all gone from what I've learned. Regarding the
dash repair I did recieve some good advice. My Japanese navy friend is out of
town on business and I've been busy as heck recently.Something about Iraq and
north Korea.So, for the moment the project's on hold. In the meantime,  I was
wondering if someone could pass the price/order address for the new Bently
shop manual reprint covering the 50 to 60 transporters. At least I can keep my
library up to speed. Before I sign off, for any of you that are ex-Navy or
Marine out there when you take a &quot;bus break&quot; check out this site... http://
www.nuwc.navy_dot_mil/hq/video/misc/ef.asf     its quite moving.
Many Thanks, to all
Mike Turner
