Subject: Hesitation Blues, was re:010 /009 Dist/cat in bus
Message-ID: &lt;c725e6ee.247f8518_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

well, the major hestation in my motor that started after I futzed and 
rejetted the carb which didn't go away from swapping an 010 dist in place of 
the 009, did go away from futzing with the carb again and reinstalling the 
'power jet'  the main jet that makes the bus go vroom.   it says 120 on it, 
which may have some coincidental relationship with reality, but then again 
may not.  But it is in that 30 pict carb and the bus is happy for it to be 
along for the ride.    

Now the motor sounds smoother than it did when I had the 009 in there and the 
carb before the futzing started.         

Besides, I like the look of those old black distribuors.  It looks cool, so 
it must be better right?  Maybe it is an anti chrome rebellion.  Talking of 
which, my cat Chrome caught a live bird today and was bringing it into the 
house, when Bob shooed her out and the bird flew away out of her mouth.  Now 
I think I have solved the mystery of the chicken hawk in the house a couple 
weeks ago.     

To bring it back to VWs, I have driven around witth Chrome in the bus, not a 
lot, but occasionally, and she seems to be getting more used to it.  She 
likes to walk around on the back of the front bench seat and look out the 
windows.    Or bounce into the back and look out the back window.  

just letting youse know
