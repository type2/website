Get ATE cylinders when you can, otherwise Varga is a &quot;will work&quot;  I've
seen another brand, whose name escapes me, that was made in some asian
country.   Which doesn't necessarily mean the Varga and ATE ones aren't
made in the orient, either.

I don't know where the shoes are relined, but I've seen varying degrees
of thickness and quality.
