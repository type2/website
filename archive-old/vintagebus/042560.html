Subject: surface rust removal...
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.10.10006081057380.71148-100000_at_users.anet-stl_dot_com&gt;

hi all,

I have decided to start tackling the surface rust on my 61.  But have a
couple different ideas on doing it.

The idea i came up with was to pull it off in the grass and spot-sandblast
the surface rust, use a metal etching prep and then prime/paint.

A friend of mine said dont do that, it removes too much metal, use a
sanding disc instead... maybe a DA sander...  this might work on flat
areas, but im sure lips edges and curved areas this would remove more
metal...

Now, my sandblaster is a sears siphon-hopper type model, i cant see where
it would remove that much metal, but being no expert i thought i'd defer
to the list...

anyone?

thanks,

Steve

p.s. sorry about my daily driver posts lately, i've been a bit of an
elitist and thats not like me. do what makes you happy i say :)
