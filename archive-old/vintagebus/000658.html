Hi George,
Not sure we would want to try this bit of your heat riser manifold procedure. 
 One would never be totally sure that the silicon would stay sealed.  If it 
did ever leak the carbonmonoxide would be sucked into the heater system 
almost directly.  Therefore we would reccomend after drilling either tapping 
and pluging these holes with screws or bolts or just welding them shut.
