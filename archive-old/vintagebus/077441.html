Subject: tie rods

Just got back from my mechanic. It is too cold in the winter for me to do
any work on the bus myself, although sometimes I may change the oil myself.
Anyway I had it in for a tune up, and to lube the front end. While up on the
lift(I wish I had a heated garage with a lift!) he noticed that the tie rod
ends were no good, I guess the bushing in there wears out. So I need to
replace this. 

A couple questions-could this be an indication that something else is wrong
in the front end, or is it just something that wears out eventually. I think
it is the original so approximately 39 years of wear and tear, not bad. 

I was thinking I should just replace both tie rod assemblies-he isn't really
going to charge me a lot more for labor to do both as he would to just
replace an end or just replace one. I looked at some online parts
sources-they don't look too expensive around $30 for the whole assembly (per
side). Is there something I should look for in purchasing these, ie are they
pretty much all the same, or are some better than others.

The existing drivers' side is adjustable, and it looks like the passenger
side is not adjustable. The new ones I see appear to both be adjustable.

Checking my parts manuals it appears as though the part number I am looking
for are as follows:
211 415 801F, and 211 415 802F. 

So I guess the basic questions:
Should I look for some other thing wrong with the front end to cause the
wear here?
Should I just replace the ends, or the whole thing?
Which type should I get (both adjustable or just the driver side)?
Which manufacturer/source do you recommend?

Thanks
