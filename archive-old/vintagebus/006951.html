Subject: Freeway? flyer 3.88/77 4th
Date: Tue, 17 Oct 2000 21:48:44 -0700
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

In my original post (I rekindled the freeway flyer thread) I stated that I
had NO PROBLEMS from 1st through 3rd and could run in third at 55 steady and
up to 65 (a little much) or 60 comfortable without a hitch, it's the 77 4th
that hurts me, I probably failed to mention that I had stuff on both my
racks and the inside of my bus was also full of crates and parts, I estimate
at least 1000 pounds extra weight. Empty my bus would have been a whole
different animal. I built this combo to cruise at least at 65-70 even 75 and
it does do that except for the hills where I had to downshift to 3rd gear
and maintain 55 mph till cresting the hill. I drive my bus and an average
road trip is at least 600 plus miles or more and I do this usually twice in
a month. After cruising 75 mph for 100 miles I stopped for fuel, checked my
oil (removed dip stick with my fingers, mechanics hands though) and the
engine did not appear hot (I do not run gauges), this can be verified by my
cruising partner who clocked me the whole way), it appears the type 3 cooler
is doing it's job, I am going to change 4 gear in the trans though and have
been in discussion with Sam at Rancho about which gear to run. He is waiting
for me to hook up the tach so we can see RPM drop between gears at which
mph, by this I will be able to figure out where my power band is and we will
install a 4th gear to help maintain this and try to keep my cruising speed
at 70 mph. My engine is a 1776 single port with 40 mm intakes and 35.5
exhaust valves, elephant feet adjusters on new rocker arms with 9 mm
adjuster screws, high rev springs(6000 rpm), with chromolly retainers with
hardened keepers (valves are Manley). Cam is a custom grind by CB
Performance for torque with lightened Scat cam followers, 69 stroke
counterweighted crank, 8 doweled ( DPR) with a stock weight flywheel.
Compression ratio is around 6.7 to 1 with the use of .040 copper head
gaskets (for E+B when I replaced the p/l after 1000 miles the gaskets
measured at .039), I also have a CB oil filter pump and am running duel
Kadrons (single port). I am EXTREMELY pleased with the engine, it's power
and it's torque, just need to sort out 4th gear and rejet to get back to my
original 20-22 mph (in rejetting to smaller mains and air corrections I lost
6+ mpg, ouch) as I progress with little changes I will keep the list (those
that care) posted on the changes and their effects on my bus.

Ronnie

ps; it's a 1960 DD empty camper with 195/14 NanKing 6 ply tires, almost
40,000 miles on them and still have tread left, but will be due for a change
by the next show season.

pps. I forgot to mention 3.88r/p  77 4th big nut reduction boxes
