Subject: Re: [VB] Water hammer?

Thanks everybody! I understand it better now, but it seems unreal that it
would get in there like that.

&gt; Also, the term you are looking for is &quot;hydrostatic lock&quot;, not &quot;water
&gt; hammer&quot;.  Water hammer is the banging you get in water systems
&gt; (plumbing) when valves are closed suddenly.

&gt; &gt; Can anyone please tell me how this
&gt; &gt; occurs?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; you answered your own question with your last
&gt; &gt; sentence: &quot;It was sitting outside, we
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; did have some real good wind and rain and it has Kadrons with gauze
&gt; &gt; filters.&quot; rain/water entered through the air filter and #1 intake
&gt; valve just
&gt; &gt; happened to be the open one at the time.

&gt; &gt; I just cleared out what I believe is called water hammer from my no.
&gt; 1.
&gt; &gt; After a
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; two day hiatus my engine wouldn't turn and looking at things before I
&gt; pull
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; motor; some water drizzled out of my right valve cover and the moter
&gt; &gt; wouldn't
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; turn past about 30-40 degrees BTDC so I pulled spark plug no.1 and the
&gt; &gt; motor
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; turned to a gushing sound and there was water on the plug. I spun the
&gt; &gt; motor
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; several times then replaced the plug and after some coaxing fired up
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; runs as
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; before. Can anyone please tell me how this occurs? It was sitting
&gt; outside,
&gt; &gt; we
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; did have some real good wind and rain and it has Kadrons with gauze
&gt; &gt; filters.
