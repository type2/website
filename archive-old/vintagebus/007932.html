Subject: 6V vs 12V

I'm loosing my patience. A bus that I bought had bits and pieces of the
original engine in it so I wanted this mechanic to put it together for me so
I can at least drive the bus until I finish the 1600cc I'm working on right
now. Today after 20 minutes on the phone with him I lost my patience and
decided to go pick it up and just finish myself. The guy was going on and on
about that I should just go and convert to 12V because there are a lot of
parts that are obsolete today and that it's hard to get 6V starters or even
light bulbs for that matter and was trying to prove how 6V is not that good
in winter cause it has less cranking power and this and that. Finally I
realized that he plane and simple is trying to sell me the motor he's got in
his shop and to do this he has to convert my bus to 12V. Looks like he was
only trying to get more money out of me.

Tell me now if I'm paranoid with this keeping the bus 6V and as close to
original as possible? I might have to convert anyway after I'm done
rebuilding this 1600 DP or is there a way to build it using 6V parts?
flywheel might be the only thing I need to change. Should I or should I?
