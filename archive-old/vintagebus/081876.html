Subject: Re: [VB] New VW longblock vs build up from scratch

Hi Don J,
If the local VW shop has a good reputation, then go with them.  If  problems 
arise later it is a lot easier to deal with someone local, than long  
distance.  Do invest in a CW crank and doghouse cooling system.  We  prefer the SP 
engines due to less intake manifold seals and more lower RPM  torque.
