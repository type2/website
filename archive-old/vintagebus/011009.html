&lt;&lt; As far as I can tell, the local VW dealer doesn't do used cars.... &gt;&gt;

Of course I can't speak for every dealership but the one I worked for 
actually had 3 used car lots.  The one at the dealership, which carried their 
name, sold the nicer cars.  There other two were &quot;Pot Lots&quot; selling the 
cheaper cars.  They were about 5 miles from the dealership in opposite 
directions and operated under different names.
