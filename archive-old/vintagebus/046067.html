&lt;&lt; I've heard that buildings can trap moisture, and with the bus in there and 
metal parts in the rafters, the less moisture the better. Right? Or would 
vents let moisture in? &gt;&gt;
Hi Jason,
Unless you always keep the interior of your structure hotter (heated) than 
the outside you really need to at least vent or use those water condensing 
machines or chemical containers.  Venting at the highest levels of the 
structure is best and is only improved with heating the interior.   Eric&amp;Barb
