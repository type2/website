&gt; In California you CANNOT buy a vehicle from most 'pick a part', 'pick your
&gt; part', or 'pick n pull' self-serve wrecking yards. They do not have a
&gt; dealers license. They only have a dismantlers license.
&gt; You can only buy parts that you can carry out thru the narrow front gate.

One more reason to cheer when California finally falls into the Pacific.
