Chris,

I think that the main objection to using an Air Conditioner with an
air-cooled engine is that the A/C makes the engine work harder to
produce power for it at precisely the time your engine is under the most
stress- when it's HOT outside. This problem is especially acute when you
are sitting in traffic, again, when the A/C is most needed and the
engine is running at it's hottest.

I think that a swamp cooler or an A/C would create condensation problems
as well.

A couple of years ago H$t VW's did an article on an A/C for a B^g in
which they claimed the modern A/C unit was so efficient that it did not
have a noticable effect on engine cooling. Of course, the A/C
manufacturer also adverti$ed in the same mag, so the article was
probably a bit bia$ed. I can try to find it if you want.

Other thoughts: add Safari windows, make sure your overhead vent system
is not clogged up with leaves, mice etc., rig scoops/ducts underneath
hooked up to your heater vents for fresh air in Summer??

sorry to be so negative on the subject, I guess you have to weigh
importance of engine life vs. comfort.

Good luck,
Dave
