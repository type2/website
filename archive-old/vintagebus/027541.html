Subject: Re: [VB] cutting safety glass

  I cut down a windshield on a Jeep I had. It was from a different year and
a little bit bigger. But it was nice and flat. 
  I put tape on the glass as a depth marker and used a grinder to grind it down
where I needed it. It's pretty messy but worked just fine. You just have to
be very careful not to get the glass hot and melt the plastic between the panes.

  I then took some fine sand paper and wet sanded it for a smooth finish. 
  If I had to do it again, I'd take it to a glass place and let them cut it.
