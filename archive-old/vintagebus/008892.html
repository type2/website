;It'll take you a little while (like a day) to confirm or refute my
suspisions. The paint is ;on the torsion arms right behind that torsion arm
cover. I discovered this when I ;parted out a '65 bus; I took everything
useable from the bus and was very surprised ;when I pulled off the covers
and discovered the brown/red paint on the torsion arms ;was still wet,
sealed inside the rear end, totally isolated from fresh air. Smelled like
;paint; felt like paint. Tacky, easily rubbed off onto something else,
including your ;hands. I'm sure it's paint.

I doubt that is was paint exactly. It is probably red lead and linseed oil
sealed in
to lubricate and prevent rust. Welded aircraft assemblies often have a small
hole that is plugged in every tube were linseed oil was put in to prevent
rust.
I is the same as paint but not ment to dry.
