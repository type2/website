Yah about a year ago when i brought this model up on the list, i had
mentioned that i saw one of these in an old black and white japanese movie
with subtitles (one of those late night boring movies),Camera was filimin it
drivin towards the camera, then the sc turned and went down the street
(then camera panned to people talking) The sc was carrying some long pipes
on the side platform and didnt have any gates. Anyone know what movie im
talking about by chance?
