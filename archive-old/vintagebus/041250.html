&gt; somewhat in quality. I am looking at RMMW and Das Bulli Haus. If anyone

I used Das Bulli for my restoration work on the 67 deluxe. I tried buying 
another sources panel, and ended up returning it as it was totally 
inferior to the Das Bulli products. We ordered and used the entire front 
set of parts below and behind the front bumper area, as well as rockers 
and floor pieces from Das and were satisfied - the body shop was 
impressed with the quality of the parts from them. 
Sounds like a commercial, eh????
