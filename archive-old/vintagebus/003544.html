 Speaking of diagnostics. Previous post described loss of power from
cylinder #2, popping and farting. Had spark, checked the jets, afeared it
might be a valve problem. Good friend Chris came over with compression gage.
Compression good. Swapped spark plug wires (just to be sure), no change.
Poured some gas down the throat of the carb (Weber 40IDF), engine speed
picks up! Now we're on to something. Check the jets again, swap #1 &amp; #2, no
change. Finally, looking through the Weber manual, I notice that the idle
jet is not part of the main jet stack. Found the idle jet for #2, very small
hole, but it doesn't look exactly round when held up to the light. Cleared
it out with a wire from a wire brush, blew it out and reinstalled. Voila!
Everything is better now. No need to tear down the engine, perform valve
job, or anything else traumatic.

Do your diagnostics. Know what the problem is before you fix it.
