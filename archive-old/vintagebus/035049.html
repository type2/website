Subject: WTB - Engive Cover for '66 Kombi
Message-ID: &lt;668706fc.24982121_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Hi There,

Anyone know where we might find an engine cover for a '66 Kombi.  The one 
thats on there now seems to be for a later model bus, cause its probably an 
inch to short.  Would prefer one with the latch also if possible.

Thanks
