Not necessarily true, the 66 deluxe (church bus) untouched all original bus
came with only 1 round mirror on the drivers side, mirrors were an option
and basically it was what ever the dealer installed. I think that it 1965 in
became a federal law that all vehicles must have an outside rear view
mirror.
the one on the church bus the arm is painted to match the bus and it has the
hinge pin in the right door

For early buses, it's round, for &quot;late&quot; it's elephant.  I make the
distiniction _at_ 63 myself.  YMMV

Your '67 should have elephant

&gt; Hello everyone. This may seem like a lunkheaded question, but, what is the

&gt; preferred mirror on a splitty bus, elephant ear style or round? I see
enough 
&gt; of both and I can't figure out which one. What does everyone on this list
