Yeah I have a 36 hp that was redone at the factory...except mine has a VW
symbol with little arrows going around it in a circle (recycle symbol). Then
it has the letter A, then the numbers, then ends with X.
Is the recycle VW symbol a common thing? I've never heard anyone mention
that before

&gt;&gt; Factory &quot;re-conditioned&quot; cases as they were called ground out a portion
of
&gt;&gt; the original engine coding and replaced it with another that identified
&gt;&gt; this re-conditioned case as such.
&gt;
&gt;I had a 40hp motor that had this.  It was rebuilt by volkswagen.  The
engine code
&gt;under the generator stand was milled out, and then a new one was stamped
in.  They
&gt;marked it with an 'X' I believe to signify it was rebuilt...then stamped
some new
&gt;numbers on it. Makes a helluva time trying to figure out exactly what the
engine
&gt;is by the code.  throw away your manuals cause they are useless to this.
