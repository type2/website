Subject: Re: vent wing latches

From my own experience, you really have to &quot;baby&quot; the new ones that are
being made now aftermarket.  I have bought 5 of them until I got smart
and realized that they break with the slightest amount of tension. 
Definately do not force the vent wing closed using only the latch.  I
use my hands on the glass itself now and pull it in tight and latch it
after.  It's a royal pain to take out the vent wing glass to re-do a
broken one.  Hope that helps....---JD


----i finally got smart and ordered some vent wing latches for my bus (I
should
have ordered them in November before it got cold). does anyone know a
procedure for installing these? do they need to be welded on or do you
just
kind of fit them on there? in case it matters, i got them from RMMW and
they
are the universal bug/bus kind in chrome. Thanks!
