well i found a jewel of a 63 15 window on the internet. so hopped in mom's
F*RD and went about 350 miles to check it out in North Mississippi.  Not to
bad.  defenitly not perfect.  drivers side louvers/gills cut out for scoop
HAVE THE PEICE and putting it back in.  dash cut HAVE THE PEICE and putting
that in. and the drivers side rocker is rusty HAVE THE PEICE and putting that
in too.  rust is not bad at all minor surface rust.  not good paint job mostly
original with some spray paint.  White over Blue.  Bus came with all windows
in decent shape. even a few extras. both bench seats!!! all jail bars.  every
thing but interior panels ANY ONE GOT ANY? PERFERABLY GREY.  have the ones
from behind the bench seat.

a 62 or 63 deluxe would have come either sealing wax red/beige grey with a
tannish interior (greyish beigy seats with white edgings) or turquoise/blue
white with the lovely light green 'como green' interior.   Which is yours?
. . . . . 
 it has original back up lights lick the 68-71 busses pretty cool.

these are almost certainly installed by a PO, but useful anyway
. . . . . . 
 M-code and vins ground off?!? why?  did find a vin in the
engine comp. by the apron execpt its not a 63 its a 62. does 62 have the
sliding driver seat this one does?
- - - - - - 
the first year for the 1/3 2/3 front seat with the drivers seat sliding was 63
model, but it actually started in July 62, so there is a month of 62
production of it.   Are your wheel wells flared or the earlier style.   What
is the VIN?  I hope it matches the title.
. . . . . . 
 so we cut a check $1500 (i dont think so
bad) drove it 150 miles went camping! and then drove rest of way back.  so
dissapointed didn't see any good vws.  just 2 crappy bugs and a bay window
bus.
but it ran great drove 350 miles on a 1600 dual port he pulled from a 71 dual
port.
i'll get pics soon!

sounds like a good deal for the price.  Corner window buses are definately
cool.
