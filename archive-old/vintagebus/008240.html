It'd be funny to see guys at some show walking around with a handful of &quot;mug
shots&quot; of listees trying to find them in a crowd.

perhaps a t-shirt??????, hat?????? pin????? sticker for a Bus would be
nice..... ideas?

Andre,

&gt; Hey, can we make a bus list photo album? Like a
&gt; yearbook or something?
&gt;
&gt; I was at OCTO and I knew there were some listees
&gt; there, but I had no idea who they were. Short of a
&gt; secret handshake, we need some way of getting to
&gt; recognize each other/break the ice.
