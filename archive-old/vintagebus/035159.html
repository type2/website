&lt;&lt; Now I have some questions. Does anybody have any experience with
 aftermarket DP heads? Are the ones with 3/4&quot; spark plug threads any
 good? What about valves? Anything better than stock? &gt;&gt;
Hi John,
From what we have heard that is the way to go if you want DP heads.  You 
might want to give Bear's VW Machine in San Diego for these new and have them 
install exhaust valves with thicker stems to help prevent dropping another 
valve!   Thanks for the interesting and detailed info.  It would be 
interesting to hear how your next engine does with gauges.   Eric&amp;Barb
