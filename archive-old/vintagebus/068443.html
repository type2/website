&gt; Anyhoo, whats involved if I wanted to upgrade to later brakes, 62-67 I 
&gt; think?

Hi Matt,
Late 1955 thru 1963 model buses have the same 3/4 ton brakes. Except for a 
one ton optional suspension kit produced in ONLY 1963.  To upgrade to the one 
ton 1964-67 model brakes which are 20% bigger and feel more like 50% 
improvement you have to replace the entire front beam.  Then you can install 
the later axles with RGBs and brake backing plates on your tranny.  If you 
can only upgrade one axle at a time do the front first to prevent having the 
rear brakes lock up and set you in a spin when panic breaking due to too 
strong of rear brakes in comparison to the earlier front brakes.
