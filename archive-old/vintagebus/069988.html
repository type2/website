Subject: Re: [VB] survey: testing cooling etc [VB] was side scoops

The open end of the manometer will give you a pressure differential
between 
--------------------- clip -----------------------
Curiosity drove me to disconnect a manifold vacume gauge line once and we
put a balloon on the end of it hanging down under the dash.
The findings with scoops: Accelerating like crazy lazy balloon, no
action. 70 mph let you foot off the gas the baloon would inflate, just
inflate to it's minimum round state. 
Test results, no pressure with scoops, engine sucks air in the harder you
run it (we all knew that).
