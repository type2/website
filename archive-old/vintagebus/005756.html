Hello everyone,
I am this ( fingers close together) close to buying a new house and would
like to raise some cash to make this transition easier...
1963 double door Panel painted by the Lone Star Brewery as a promo vehicle.
1500sp and 64+ front brake added in 65. Completely stock other than the
exterior paint. New clutch,axle boots, battery, restored gas tank, brakes in
front, ties rods, steering damper, tires, some window rubber, carb (30pict
that looks like a 28) POR15'd front floor and under pedal pan. Runs and
drives excellent. Original seat covers (driver side torn), cab
divider,wheels, and interior paint. Ignition key locks drivers door and
hatch.
Will entertain any offers as long as you can act before July 20th (closing
date)
Thanks,
Brian

pan?
