D.O.T. requires a certain thickness of glass to be &quot;street legal&quot;.
Original windshields are NOT up to the current safety standards. (This is 
what I was told the last time I had glass cut).
This is california though.......

&lt;&lt;Ohhboy,

now i've heard everything (though this doesnt suprise me one bit.)

what is their logic (or lack thereof) for refusing to cut you a piece of
laminated safety glass designed for windshield use into the shape of your
windshield?

Im almost afraid to hear the answer ;)

take care,

Steve&gt;&gt;
