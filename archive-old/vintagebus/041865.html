&gt; My buddy and I were dissecting some heads today; we noticed that several

&gt; hold the keepers. The lands were reduced to about the thickness of  dimes
&gt; :P  We  see this on exhaust and intakes....

&gt; Is anyone else seeing this? Softer valve metal, lousy keepers that score
&gt; the metal, valve float?????????

Well, the only thing that would allow the keeper to lose tension and move
is the spring going loose some time while operating.

One trick I've seen is to be sure that the keepers seat securely on the
valve stem.  Fit them on the bare valve and be sure that they aren't loose
when you press them together and wiggle them around.  If they are, grind
material away from the split until they fit properly.
