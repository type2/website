I just returned from some long deserved vacation out in San Diego. While I 
played super dad with the kid and gained points with the wife I was always 
checking out the beach (Mission Beach) bus scene. Few splits but all the same 
all busses are good in my mind. 

Anyways, I just fell in love with a bicycle that is built by DYNO Bikes and 
the model in particular is the &quot;Classic&quot;. I have been unsuccessful in 
locating a dealer here in Kansas City. Can someone in Southern California 
please contact me with information on this beach cruiser style bike. I would 
love to have this compliment my bus and perhaps make me realize that 
thrashing mountain bikes is a thing of my past and cruising is now and 
forever. Just like a bus right !

Thanks for the reply.
