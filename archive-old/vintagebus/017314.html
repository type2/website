Hi, Volks!

I'm ready to sell my bus for $1450

It's a white 1967 Kombi walkthrough, has 2 louvered windows, 2 popout
windows; it's a factory 12 volt model, 220,000 miles on it, runs OK.

The good news:
The engine and transmission both have less than 1000 miles since a
rebuild. They were both built by my mechanic of 10 years who is very
careful and competent.
It got a new carburetor and fuel pump with the rebuild, and also had an
auxiliary oil filter added.
The tires have less than 1000 miles on them.
The battery is 4 months old.
The paint is original.
The body is very straight. The only collisions it's had were with a deer,
resulting in some dents on the front, and two rearends at &lt;5 mph
It has been in my family since 1968, and has been driven gently and
treated well. We have lived in California or Arizona the whole time
except for 2 years in Iowa.

The bad news:
It's been sitting for about 5 years since the rebuild, just driven around
the block once in a while. (gas in tank is useable)

The following are missing from it:
Wing window handle (right side)
Sliding window handle (driver's door)
Exterior handle, side door
VW emblem on front
Most of the interior panels
2 hubcaps
Spare rim+tire
Both front seats (and the original mount for the driver's seat has been
cut out, so you would not be able to just get another seat and stick it
in)
The apron.
While it was a camper conversion (California Road Runner Camper), all the
camper stuff has been taken out.

Other problems:
The gas gauge isn't working, probably a bad sending unit.
The turn signal lever assembly is a little loose.
It won't signal a right turn. Turn signal relay? Loose connection? I
don't know.
Brakes may be weak.
There are a few very minor dents in the front, and the engine compartment
door has a moderate dent/bend.
The rain gutter has a few bent places.
There are a lot of little rust spots (none deep)
The floor in front has some rust holes that go all the way through.

I realize the list of bad news seems to go on and on, but it really is in
decent shape for its age and most of the things are very minor. I'm just
trying not to leave out anything that might be important. I think my
asking price of $1450 is reasonable and reflects the condition. The car
is
driveable as is, with very few repairs that really HAVE to be done right
away.

It looks decent as is, and there are no places where the body is rusted
through except under the front floormat.

Harry Houck was kind enough to take some pictures for me,
as I lack a digital camera. Email me and I'll send them to you.
