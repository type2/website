&gt; tell me those turn signals are a south african delivery thing and this guy

&gt; palm green. that roof isnt supposed to be sand green is it??
&gt; later,

Not to mention the safaris with no safari disconnects, 1966 wiper arms and
blades... i'd bet a dollar to a donut that wasnt an original safari bus...

but to be fair, it is a beutiful RHD bus and i'd love to have it! (though
not at that price, im not quite that affluent)

take care,

Steve 

p.s. i am often sad to see for sale pages... especially ones with vacation
photos, you wonder what has become of the people in the picture and why
they no longer wish to enjoy their VW...
