Actually my 67 westy was also painted in the rear of the inside the same
color as the rest of the bus.  I did not have a speck of grey primer
anywhere.  I believe I was the first to completely dismantle the
interior to nothing.   I do know that the american camper buses had grey
primer in the rear and not painted.  I think the westys where
different.  I also  did a 64 hatchtop westy that was the same as mine,
factory painted in the rear.  Go figure.


Okay...now you've managed to get me thoroughly confused....not hard to
do....so your cargo area isn't primered under the wood?  Did someone go
in
and paint it?  'Cause stock the campers came as Kombi's (cab painted,
but
primered and bare in the cargo area) and then the wood panelling and
camper
stuff went in.......right?  So what's up with your camper?  Please
clarify
for me...unless you thik I'm too far lost!  *8-)
