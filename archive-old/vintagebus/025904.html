Subject: input shaft slop and front spindle woes
Message-ID: &lt;3803FA69.C32F886C_at_evestamail_dot_com&gt;

To the friendly and knowledgeable list members,

In the mist of all the thrashing last week I had a few questions...

How much slop can there be in the tranny input shaft? i can move it up
and down with my finger. The unit doesn't have any problems except
popping out of 3rd on occasion on an extreme up hill grade.  When I
changed trans fluid (Stay Lube GL-4) the magnetic drain plugs has very
few filings and two chips about 1/4 the size of a pencil eraser when i
looked down the input shaft into the back end of the tranny i saw a snap
ring on the shaft. Is that what's holding the reverse gear and should i
be able to see it?

Now to the front of the kombi
Remember  the booggered up drivers side spindle? where can i find a 22
mm X 1.5 reverse thread die and the proper welding rod to build it up?
and i need the proper nuts once this is all finished.
I donno... that 68 front end is sounding more affordable.
also on the spindle side... how do you know what is the right seal? if
the PO mangled the thing that bad how do i know i got the right spacers/
seals? my beaks were contaminated and the seals were torn up on both
driver and passenger side.

that'll do for now.

aloha
