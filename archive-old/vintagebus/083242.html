Subject: Re: [VB] re:overheating

&gt; sounds like you changed where the air was sucked in through, which is not
&gt; stopping a vacuum

Fraid not. In order to &quot;change where the air was sucked through&quot;, I would
have to block off the stock louvers in order to change where air was sucked
through. I added a second place for air to come into the engine bay, not
changed where it comes from.
&gt;
&gt; I found very little difference in engine bay pressure under tests... as in
&gt; not more than 1mmHg between idle and 4K rpms.

No offense, but all that means is that you did the test wrong. If you didn't
detect any air pressure changes in your engine bay from idle to 4000rpm,
your testing was skewed and way off base. Do the test again with proper
equipment and see for yourself.
