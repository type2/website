&gt; OK, I just spent an hour trying put hub cap retaining clips on one
&gt; wheel, how in the H#LL do you do this (1970 &amp; earlier 5 lug wide
&gt; pattern wheels)??  I was trying to pound the little rivot flat on the
&gt; back that holds the clip and all I have to show is 3 smashed fingers!  
&gt; Anybody have any tips they'd like to share???

Heat, John... Heat is your friend :-)  Also a proper anvil and a GBH[1]
Put the rivet thru the clip and wheel (I know, you already know this part
:), put the wheel/rivet/clip sandwich on the anvil so that the rivet is
*tight* in place, take a blow torch to the rivet 'til the rivet is cherry
red, then whack it a good one with the GBH.  Two people make the job 
much easier.  Things to watch:

make sure the sandwich is *tight* before applying the hammer;
one solid blow is much better than many small ones;
the anvil should be solidly anchored to the ground or work bench;
the anvil ought to outweigh the hammer by at least 2-3:1 and 10-20:1 is
better!

If you don't have a real anvil (so few do these days :-), then a visit to
the local steel fabricators will usually produce an acceptable substitute.
for under $20.  Let them know what you want and they will set you up in a
jiffy. A length of rail from a railroad track can be quickly cut into a
very servicable anvil.

[1] GBH = Great Big Hammer.  A two pound sledge would seem appropriate
here.
