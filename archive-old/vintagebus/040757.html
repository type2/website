Extended Road Trip Tecnique

Step One: Loose your job in some manner... IE layoff, get fired, etc., just
so long as you get a nice big fat severance check.  Maybe even blackmail
them like in &quot;American Beauty&quot;

Step Two: Before you leave, file your unemployment claim.  I don't know
about other states, but here in Mizzery we can make our weekly claims over
the phone with a 800 number from anywhere in the country. Most recently, I
opened my claim from a pay phone at a gas station on some Indian reservation
in New Mexico. Pretty kewl eh?  Take advantage of their electronic deposit
service, and that way every week on the road you get a cool 220$ in you
account. (BTW, Mizzery has about the worst unemployment in the Union, so
therefore the measly 220$/wk...  not much to live on, but it will provide
good gas/food money)

Step Three: DON'T EAT OUT. One of the biggest keys I think to surviving a
long road trip in an extended manner is to avoid the fast-food places.  I
don't know about you all, but I can spend 5$ easy at one of them places.
Before I left for NM in November, I went grocery shopping, and bought myself
lots of &quot;camping rations&quot;.. you know, SPAM and the like...  Spent maybe 45$,
and It lasted me a week and a half on the road.

Step Four: Don't go if your bus is in questionable mechanical condition.
Nothing will break the bank faster than say, burning a valve out in the
desert and having to buy a whole new engine or something out on the road.
Get a membership in AAA too, cause ya' just never know. The Turk may be ugly
as hell and have rust holes in the rockers you can stick your head through,
but he's a mechanical mule... KNOW FEAR. After surviving that poor excuse
for a road going into Chacco Canyon, I ain't scrarda 'nuttin!

Step Five: Pray like hell you find something quick when you get back, or
have it lined up before you leave.  Don't believe ANYBODY that tells you the
&quot;oh it should be easy to find a new job in the computer industry&quot; rhetoric..
it's a load of CRAP.

Something I've always wondered: those of you who do these
road-trips-from-hell -
how do you afford that?  I can't imagine taking 6 months off to
go fart around the countryside.  Not having any recently deceased rich
relatives, if I don't work, I don't eat, and my buses don't eat.
