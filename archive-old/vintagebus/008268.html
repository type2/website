Subject: An annoying rattle and a SECOND clutch cable break
Date: Mon, 20 Mar 2000 20:01:13 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

About 4 weeks ago the strangest rattle started on my '67 bus (EVERYTHING
stock).  It only is there when I am in 4th gear (never the other 3 gears)
going 40-45 MPH.  If I go 35 or so in 4th; no noise.  If I go 50+ MPH; it
goes away.

The only way to describe the sound would be like a loose clamp rattling
around on a steel beam.

It would seem to me that if it was related to the engine or something on the
body, it would be there when I hit a like RPM on the motor in other gears.
My only concern is that it could be related to the transaxle.  Any sage
thoughts on weird noises in the 40-45 MPH range??

-----------
On another note, the clutch cable I replaced less than 3 months ago broke on
my way to lunch today.  The good news was that it broke 3 blocks from the
VWFLAPS and they replaced it for no charge.  I swapped it out this
afternoon; a post-mortum showed that the cable itself appears to have pulled
out of the connector closest to the clutch cable.  The guys at the FLAPS
said they had never seen one break there and it had to have been bad from
the factory.
Just my luck.  I bought the bus to have fun fixing it (BTW I'm having the
time of my life!!!), but I hate like he** having to fix the same thing twice
because of bum parts.

Cheers!
