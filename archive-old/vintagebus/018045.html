BTW, instead of a headliner there is the same paneling up top. Is 
this the way Sundial's came or is this someone's elaboration on the theme?

I am not sure about sundials....i have an EZ-Camper, supposdly these are very
similar. The paneling on the top of mine(original)is some type of masonite
with a faux wood paneling on top, basically it looks like a birch panel.
