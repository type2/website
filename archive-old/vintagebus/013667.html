Just a reminder that the VintageBus Online Bus Registry is still alive and well,
with over 400 buses now.  You can enter all this m-tag information and
get the information you need to know, in addition to being able to browse
thru all the other buses in the registry, something none of the other registries
offer!  You can also see stats; for example like Northern California is the
Bus Capitol of the world, with 10% of the buses!

The scripts that decode the information are still undergoing construction, but
the capture mechanism is in place and working.
