&lt;&lt; But don't you feel guilty, that you were not happy with how your bus was as
 you got it? You want to make it something it is not, you will hurt its
 feelings. Anyone have a bus with a good cargo door section? I want to make
 mine a double door.

H Y P O C R I T E.....isnt this the exact same thing as lowering a bus?  If
you arent happy with your bus at standard height and you lower it, that hurts
the bus's feelings.  Dont you feel guilty for not liking your bus as VW
intended it to be?  If someone transplants a roof, there's a very good chance
a bus came from the factory that way.  We've all seen a factory sunroof
Kombi's, but there's never been a lowered bus from the factory.   

Sorry to rehash the lowered bus thread, but there's only so much I can take
from the DKB's before something needs to be said
