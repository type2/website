Subject: Re: [VB] FW: Eureka! I think I found the idleing issue

&gt;We doubt that the intake manifold could be that badly bent just due to a
&gt;badly flycut engine.  Do check for vaccum leaks, but make sure the check the
&gt;whole length of the  manifold and if no leak found remove it and run a water
&gt;test to make sure the heat riser tubes are not rusted through to the intake
&gt;tube.

i've had one end tweaked just enough  out of true to cause that head 
to not seal right. a pipe and a nearby tree for leverage fixed it :)
also, a big mystery was solved once when we found a manifold that 
HELD water when cold, but when hot the seam between the heat riser 
and manifold tube would open up and start leaking!
