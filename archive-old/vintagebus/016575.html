Subject: sacto to la this weekend?

Hello Listees,

I posted a request if anyone was going to the bug-o-rama a coupla weeks ago, 
and would be willing to lug a door for me.  I have that request again, but 
with a twist.

Is there anyone out there going from sacramento to the classic that would be 
willing to carry a passenger front door from Greg Banfill for me?  My sister 
lives in Orange county, and I could vector her in your direction to retrieve 
said door.  I am in salt lake, and I can't make it to the shows because this 
weekend is my anniversary, and i can't talk the wife into going to a VW 
show.  I'm working on it though.

I will be going down to LA to visit my sister in the next month or so, and I 
could get the door then.  I know, it's kind of a long way to get  it here, 
but that's how it works.

Now if there was someone going to the show from utah/idaho/colorado area...

Thanks in advance,

Mike Anderson
