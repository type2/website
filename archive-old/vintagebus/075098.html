Subject: RE: [VB] single port v dual port

  There are 3 genuine VW duel port heads out there in the market place with
only the Mexican VW duel port with long reach plugs. OOPs also the 041
(39X32) so that really makes 4 genuine heads. Neither of the Brazilian OE
heads have long reach plugs. AutoLinia (aftermarket heads) also come with
3/4 reach plugs. There are no single port genuine heads I have ever seen
with long reach plugs,, even though they are a little beefier casting then
early single port heads.

ronnie

ps. In taking apert a few engine with long reach plug heads I have not
noticed the tell tale cracks as the non long reach ones.

pps. I also have a pile of OE single port heads with cracks between the
seats, not at the plugs. So single port crack just as duel port heads in my
observations

ppps. I have never seen a German head with long reach plugs

Unless you are using a pre 74 DP, all the DP heads were thickened up and all
the replacement SP heads were beefed up too. If you buy a new VW head,
either
flavor, you will only get the thick heads. Most of the aftermarket heads are
also thicker.

&gt; Dual port has a few more horsepower than SP.   DP also has less metal

stuff.

Is this true with the Mexican long-reach heads?  I'm pretty certain that
they went to long reach plugs to beef up that crack-prone area.
