 That would look great on my camouflaged single cab!  I always wanted one for SUVs but now I could recalibrate it to seek out Islamic militants.   :-)     Hehehe

A few years back, our freindly backyard arms dearly in this area had
used military surplus missile launchers mounted on trailors for sale. I
am not kidding. Don't know if he is still in business and if he still
has them but the name of the firm was CHIPS and was located in Tuxedo,
Maryland. Looked to me like they could be pulled by a strong bus. Had a
nice little seat for the operator and everything. Just amazing what is
out there.
