Subject: re: restore or not to

Why not clearcoat it with clear POR-15 like Rachel's friend did with his
Kiekhaefer Mercury bus? :-)

I agree with the general sentiment: mechanical fix, replace necessary
rubber, patch, and drive.  I've heard too many &quot;just got it back on the
road and I was rear-ended&quot; stories from people who dropped $10k on a
resto; and heard Ellis &amp; others bemoan the way entropy sets in so quickly
on that showroom stock resto.

That's why I painted my 65 with tractor paint (it was primered when I got
it) but the running gear is (about to be) nice &amp; solid.  Ees a trock, mon.
