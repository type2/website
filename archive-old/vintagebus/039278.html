Subject: Got it Running! Fuel Leak found (in time)
Date: Mon, 27 Jul 1998 07:15:31 -0700

Well I finally got the time to work on my bus.
For those snoozing on my previous posts, it's
a '67 Deluxe Hard Top.

PO claimed a bad distributor is what is causing
poor running, more specifically won't run at
anything above an idle.

I noticed the inlet line to the fuel pump was 
loose and a small crack in the housing nearby.  
Dropped by FLAPS (Pozzi's) to get a fuel
pump, found out I had an early pump with the 
threaded inlet fitting.  These were apparently not
available, so went ahead and got a newer one
with fixed inlet/outlet pipes.  This left the existing
fuel line too short.

I bought a brass fuel shut off valve.  The fittings
for the ends were made for a slightly larger fuel
line, so I cranked up the large drill, used it as a 
lathe and turned down the barbs a bit to ease
assembly.

Cable tied it to the fan housing and scrounged 
through my lamp parts bin to find insufficient parts
to build a through-the-firewall adapter.  Found a small
piece of fuel line to complete installation of fuel
lines.  Existing lines looked new (can you see it coming).

Installed a remote starter in the engine bay and cranked it
up.  Sure enough one of the 'new' looking PO installed
fuel lines had a pin hole leak and sprayed fuel onto the
coil.  Shut it down.  I'll replace ALL fuel lines, next chance
to get to the bus.

Installation of a remote starter in the engine bay is one
of those items that while it COULD be extremely dangerous
(if it was left in gear), it makes checking the engine
for leaks, arcs, etc VERY easy and makes it extremely
fast to shut down.  I use a spade/alligator clip jumper
between black wire on coil and hot wire to provide power
to engine so I can actually start it from the engine bay.
I would rather be in the engine bay to see it as it starts,
than be up front and have to run back and forth.
I recognize the dangers and always take the necessary 
precautions to keep from getting run over by my own bus,
as that would be very embarrassing.

I replaced the one leaky fuel line and started it up.  It ran
fine, but brakes need attention as it pulled heavily to
the right.  I know it needs bleeding, but will check other
things as well.

I speculate that the leak in the inlet side of the fuel pump
caused air to be sucked in during acceleration causing
lack of fuel, thus lack of performance.  Amazing how some
people blame a vacuum advance distributor for problems,
when it is really something else altogether.

Oh yeah, checked the carb, it's a 34PICT, the dist is
a 078 (autostick beetle), dual port heads.
