Bend the end over into a half-circle.  Hook a cotter pin on it.  Slide
the cotter pin into the barrel nut and tighten down.  A PO did this on
one of my buses a while back, and it worked fine for years.  Made
engine R&amp;R a little more interesting, because you had to keep track of
the cotter pin, but that's about it.
