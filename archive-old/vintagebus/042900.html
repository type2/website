The line between earning respect and drawing criticism is a very fine
line.  I say crossing that line would involve something like hacking big
*ugly* taillights that don't compliment the look of the bus or other body
mods that are bulky and/or unattractive like different bumpers or fender
flares.  But it all boils down to what you like and what you want your bus
to look like.  And if you are that worried about getting criticized about
something you like and want to do to your bus, then get a spine.

&gt; I'm planning some major hacks on my '67...  Where is the line between
&gt; earning respect and drawing criticism?
