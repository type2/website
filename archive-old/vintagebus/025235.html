I own a residential lighting store(ie. chandeliers,lamps, antique
restorations,etc.,etc..)in Barrington,Il.
I am in the process of restoring a 61dd panel to use as my delivery
truck!!
question-- I want to have my business logo applied to the side of the
bus when it is completed
but I really don't want to paint it on the bus .Does anyone know if I
can use some type of static
sign that is indiscernable? magnets are too obvious I think. I want it
to look painted on.
    Thanks, woody
