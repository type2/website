I've been getting the final kinks out of my '67 westy and am working on
my &quot;rebuilt&quot; steering box. I can get it pretty tight but the box seems
to be stiff when turning left, that is it drags and stays when I turn
the wheel left but is smooth and returns to center when turning right.

In one of my manuals it describes adjusting both by the screw and also
by shims on the lower cover, where the horn wire comes out.

Any one know of a source for the shims and gaskets for this cover?

Thanks - Tim in Minneapolis
