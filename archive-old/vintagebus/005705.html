Hello everyone.  I am a long time lurker for 2 years or more. I don't
contribute much because of my lack of VW's I did buy a 59 European panel
about a year ago.  Much more work than I can handle body wise until I get
myself a welder.  So I would have my Uncle the census taker to look out for
an old split. He found one just down the street from him.  Much less work
involved and it runs! After looking at it I told the old man I was
interested. I started coming up and working on it.  I replaced the carb and
fuel lines basically got it ready to drive to my Grandfathers so I can work
on it.  I currently have the motor out changing out the generator to an
alternator.  The PO must of put the generator back in because he forgot
allot of small items..... two keys, backing plate etc. No wonder he parked
it when it wouldn't charge the battery. After collecting everything I'm
putting it back together.  I currently am having a problem with my master
cylinder. I posted about that last week.  Thank you everyone for the help.
I am very excited about having another VW to work on. I am very excited to
be asking all of these questions.  It truly is like riding a bicycle and all
this reading I have been doing for the last couple of years is knowledge
I've been saving.  Thank goodness we have great volks in here.   Ok enough
ramblings I've gotta go find out my year of the bus.  I'll be posting more
soon.
The plates that I did find are the one behind the passenger seat.

01 N
425 002 043 081 114
UH 2812 424283 6051365

then the plate above the passenger seat on the fresh air.

Tvp 28
Heizg 21255   A Prutz m S 45
Fahrgest. -nr  286051365
Zul Gesamtgew. K Banjahr 2070
Zul Achslast Vorn Kg 950      (axle loads)
hinten Kg. 1150

I put what I could in the registry so I'm sure I've done something wrong
because I can't find the year. Help?  Thank you

Rob
