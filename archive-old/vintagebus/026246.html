Subject: [VB] ebay middle seat price is actually $450
Message-ID: &lt;3832110E.46B0_at_peak_dot_org&gt;

The middle seat owner just told me vai email it is reserved at $450, but
he might go $400.
I am tempted to bid it up to $399, just to piss him off.
I hate it when they start the bidding at ridiculously low numbbers
