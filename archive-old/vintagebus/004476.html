Subject: gas tank valve cork 
Date: Sun, 6 Aug 2000 18:17:12 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I'm in the process of putting my gas tank back in and Bently says to
recondition the gasket - which my valve never didn't have when I took it
out - anyway, can I just make this thing - how bout teflon tape - would that
work?

TIA
