Subject: [VB] front seat area? 

As an aside I have a 67 Samba Non walk through sliding door model.  There are 
no belly pans fitted nor can I see any sign of them being fitted. I  was told 
all Sambas had belly pans. Is this another urban myth? Mike
PS I haven't seen the Deluxe sill trim fitted to any Sliding door  models, 
has any listee?
