Subject: Re: Polorizing a new generator

&gt;From: VOLKSVAN12_at_aol_dot_com

&gt;
&gt;The instructions with the generator (Bosch rebuilt) indicate to leave
&gt;the regualtor hooked up and to jump the B+ to 61.  I'm a llitl concerned
&gt;keeping the regulator hooked up.

I don't think Bosch would supply directions that would cause you to blow
up your new generator before you even run it.

&gt;Also using bently, I'm a bit confused on which wire is considered the
&gt;+ side and which one is the - minus side.  Both are red, both are the
&gt;same thickness.

Which Bentley?  Look at page E-2 5 of the '63-'67 Bentley.  The wire
connected directly to the positive brush goes to + or D+ on the regulator.
The other wire goes to F or DF on the regulator.

One thing that can be confusing is that the '63-'67 Bentley discusses
three different generators in detail and mentions two more.  If you
look at the discussion of the Bosch generator with the regulator on
top of the generator, you'll _probably_ be OK.

I'd vote for installing the generator+regulator, following the Bosch
directions that came with the generator, and seeing what happens.  If
the generator light is off with the key off, on with the key on and
engine not running, and off with the engine running, things are probably
fine.
