You can run it off the main wire going to the ignition switch, make sure you 
put a fuse on it. If you put any kind of amp. in the bus, or equalizer or 
anything that has more power then just a radio I would run a separate wire 
directly to the battery as the bigger drain would cause heat with could fry 
your harness. (Tim)! but a radio should be fine on the main wire to the 
ignition.
