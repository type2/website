&gt; List
&gt; I know this is a long shot but what the heck I figure someone may have one
&gt; and need some extra cash or parts.
&gt; I am looking for a older westy tent (the large one) for my 61 flip seat. I
&gt; am willing to consider everything available though my preference would be
&gt; the more common color combo of yellow and gray. I have cash and / or parts
&gt; for trading (Example of parts are; complete crewcab tilt, 62-63 only full
&gt; middle seat, 64 to 67 3/4 middle seat. single wheel trailer, early jail
&gt; bars, etc..). Please let me know if you have a tent for sale.
&gt; Thanks

I know it's not what you are hoping for, but there is a Red / White one on
Everett's site for $1300 right now. With pole bag, stakes, poles, and floor(?)

Get me that one and I'll trade you one of my Yellow and Gray ones for
it.......

Greg
