Subject: RE: [VB] Internal pipe wrench/ hardware stores

From: George Lyle [mailto:glyle_at_pon.type2_dot_com]
&gt;
&gt; I use the &quot;proper&quot; tool when I can, but the internal wrench
&gt; will work even on a chewed-up nut.  I don't see many perfect nuts these
&gt; days!

Well I found a Lowes today - I couldn't believe how big it was.  We have DIY
stores in the UK but nothing like that.  They didn't have what I wanted.
Then found an Ace - again we have small shops that have a small selection of
bits and pieces - but they tend to only cater for one trade not all.  They
had internal wrenches but only up to 3/4&quot;.  
But the guy there was really helpful and has recommended a Plumbing supplies
but unfortunately they are only a Monday to Friday place.  So hopefully
Monday I may have some success.

Thanks a lot
Paul
