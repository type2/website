Subject: Re: International Travel Questions

Steve asked:
&gt; Just a brief question to those of you going 
to Bad Camberg regarding traveling overseas 
during this upcoming time of war/uncertainty.

The very nervous SO is starting to freak so 
I need some good calming your nerves type 
responses to traveling over &quot;there&quot;. &lt;

------------------
On another list, a listee was to travel from
Israel to the US. A friend of theirs who 
hitchhikes at night through some troubled areas 
in Israel suggested that they take their state-issued
gas mask with them to the US. Their impression
is that it's more dangerous in the US than
in the trouble spots within Israel. 

It's all perception. There is good everywhere,
and there are few really truly bad people.
Just behave as you would in a location within
the US you haven't been to, wary but optimistic.
