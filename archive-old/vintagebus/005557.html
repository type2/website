Subject: Re: [VB] Short Turning Radius on 64 SC

&gt; After Driving Eric's P. Bus Sprout I realized my turning radius on the
&gt; 64 single cab is way short compaired to Eric's and what he said to all
&gt; other splits he's driven, I thought that mine was normal and that's how
&gt; all splits buses where. Any one know what the turning radius should be?
&gt; What might be the problem with mine? How can I correct it?
&gt;

I fail to see why you would want to 'correct' this problem. A shorter
turning radius is a good thing.
