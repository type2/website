Subject: Still won't start:(

OK. This is my often mentioned 1600cc DP engine that came in my '59 
Kombi. I had to take it out, tear it down, and overhaul it. Got it 
back together and installed in the bus. Now the engine turns, but 
will not fire up. I'm getting fuel to the carb just fine.

I've replaced the coil, spark plug cables, spark plugs, condenser, 
points, and have a nice strong battery in there. I've also cleaned 
the contacts on the disty cap and roter.

It fired up fine before I pulled it and did the rebuild. Now it turns 
and won't fire up. I'm so anxious  to get it started for the break-in 
and so I can get on with driving this thing.

Running out of patience........
