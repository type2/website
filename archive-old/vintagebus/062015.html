Yes,

My wife's car was stolen and found a day later with the engine (and a few 
other things) missing.

My daughter's '71 Bug was stolen a couple of weeks ago, but the guys were 
busted before they were able to remove anything.

I have been busy the last week building trackers for all my vehicles, 
here's my daughter's car

Oh... you weren't talking about that type of engine steal. I'm guessing 
you're talking about coming out of your house, getting into your bus, 
turning the key on and nothing happens. &quot;Hmmmm.... dead battery?&quot;, open the 
deck lid and lo and behold... no engine.....

Sorry, can't help you on that one. In reality, that would have to be one 
very stupid thief to pull an engine and risk getting caught in the process. 
But then again, who said thieves are smart?

Scott
