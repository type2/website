&gt; I assume there are 4 bolts??  I have found 2, inside a bracket that looks 
&gt; to the tranny mount. and possibly on behind the shroud, ala the bay window 
&gt; where the starter bolts on through the firewall.  Is there another? 

Hi Hapybus,
Below under your bus there are two studs with nuts and washers on them.  
Above is one bolt that you remove the nut and washer off the starter on the upper 
right side of the engine just in front of the shroud, this one we leave till 
last though!  The upper left just in front of the shroud either will be the 
same setup as the upper right or will be just a bolt that you have to get to by 
reaching up by the end of the clutch cable and unbolt from a threaded insert 
pressed into the engine case.
  Make sure first to have all wires removed from the engine and the three 
cables to the crab and the heater boxes disconnected and as the engine comes out 
you will need to reach over the left side of the engine and remove the 
flexable fuel line just in front of the front engine tin and plug it with a golf tee 
of Philips screw driver if you do not have a reserve switch you can just shut 
off the fuel with.
