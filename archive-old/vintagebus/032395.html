Why do you want to repaint a bus that has original paint in good 
condition???????

&gt;Hello everyone. Quick question. I am greatly considering getting my bus
&gt;painted. Right now it has the original paint on it which is in good
&gt;condition. It is Pearl White/Green color scheme. I have always liked the
&gt;Chestnut Brown/Sealing wax red colors and I am considering these for the new
&gt;paint job. How will this affect the value of the bus in the end? I do plan on
&gt;keeping it but you never know what could happen. So, original or unoriginal?
&gt;I am very curious to know.. Thanks in advance for your replies.
