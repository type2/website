Hey list check this out,
    (not an april fools joke) It looks like I have found a Nos 3rd brake 
light decklid for my 63' panel and I am not saying how much just yet but 
what do think something like that would be worth...still in the box? A 
friend said I should be getting it this or next week from a man in colorado 
that cleaned an old storehouse out and found some bus parts all new. I am a 
little reluctant to believe this, but lets hope its true because...whoa!
