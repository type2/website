Subject: Looking for...

Hello al,

 I have been looking for a few goodies that I can't
seem to find locally. Any help would be appreciated in
locating a thermostat for my shroud (1600cc
W/Doghouse) and someone intersted in trading a pre -72
Westy stool for a one year only 73 stool. The stool i
have is in great shape and I would expect the other to
be as well. 
Thanks in advance,

Sean
