Hey guys and gals.  I broke the 1/2 breaker bar that my father-in-law gave
me (an extra one that had seen better days).  I took it to Home Depot where
I saw a deal they going to try to promote their line of Husky tools.  The
deal is; Bring ANY brand of tool that is warranted for life and broken and
they will replace it free.  I was skeptical but I gave it a try and sure
enough the guy looked at it and said &quot;yep, that's broken&quot;.  He then threw it
into a box of broken tools and gave me a new one.  I said &quot;that's it?&quot; and
he said &quot;yep&quot;.  The breaker bar I had said S-K on it.  I'm not sure if
that's a good brand or not.  I currently only have Craftsman and Snap-on.  I
was going to throw out the bar and go buy a new one.  Glad I didn't.  The
Husky brand breaker bar was priced at $20 and I got it for FREE.  Just
thought I'd let y'all know about it.
