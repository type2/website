A '65 would have had a church key lock and would have come standard with a 1500
cc motor.

&gt; Hello list---
&gt; I just got a package of various parts I bought from a guy who was clearing
&gt; some stuff out. There is a church - key decklid in the stash that has an
&gt; emblem just above the license light area that says &quot;1500&quot;(but it's a
&gt; different &quot;1500&quot; emblem than a bug--It's squarer  like the volkswagen emblen
&gt; on the back of later year splits) ---it is an original paint decklid and the
&gt; emblem even has those stock little O-rings on the inside. Is this a decklid
&gt; an original for those 1500 optioned busses in the earlier 60's-(it is a
&gt; church key lid?) It's interesting and I just wan't some info?
&gt; BTW, isn't it funny that after you search for a lid for months and spend more
&gt; than you want to on one, another is practically given to you. I had the same
&gt; thing happen on the NOS 58-61 taillights I bought a while back!
&gt;
&gt; thanx
