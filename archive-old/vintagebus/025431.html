A filter of any sort is a really good idea.  You probably read Bob Hoover's
reply already.  I can't add to what he already said, but there's a few options
to consider as to what kind of filter and where to put it.  By far, the best is
a full flow filter.  This filters all your oil.  The next best is a remote
cooler/filter setup.  I came across Bob's recommended oil cooler/filter setup in
the Sermons while they were still available online.  Basically a diverter plate
&gt;from where the stock oil cooler lives, lines through the fan shroud to the left
side of the engine room through a filter to a cooler assembly.  It doesn't
filter all your oil all the time, just when the oil's reached operating
temperature and has been diverted through the cooler.  The cooler system is
quite efficient, and the filter is mounted on the left side engine room pillar.
I haven't bothered calculating thermal efficiencies or anything fancy like that
but I have noticed a 50 degree drop in my oil temps.  The filter is easily
accessible, and the system adds almost a quart to the amount of oil a complete
oil/filter change takes (additional oil capacity).
