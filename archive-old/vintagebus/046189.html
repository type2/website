&lt;&lt; Also I have heard rumor (don't know of anyone that's actually done it), 
that
 you can swap the spindles in the front from the left side to the right, and
 vica/versa to get 4-5&quot; of drop without affecting the camber, or bumpsteer. &gt;&gt;

Actually there is a guy with I think a 67 hard top deluxe that lives in Vegas 
and works at a casino there.  Its lime green and white.  He reversed the 
spindles on his but from the description of the work, I would rather just buy 
some dropped spindles.  He had to cut the spindles and reweld, i wont go into 
detail because I kinda think it's rather rediculous.  Alot of work and time 
when you could just buy spindles. JMHO

See you all at Jerome!
