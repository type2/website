I don't chime in often, lack of knowledge and such, however you said it my 
man, preach the good word.  Maybe after fifty years or so of this, we might 
stop electing officials such as a nameless Bush, who stocks his cabinet with 
wealthy oil giants from exxon, chevron, and enron.


&gt;And if you do further research EXXON Corp, posted there highest earnings in
&gt;HISTORY, artificially inflated fuel prices mean high profits for the gas
&gt;companies and larger electric bills for those that live in Cali.
&gt;FWIW. AZ. power plants that have been sitting idle are stockpiling diesel
&gt;fuel to fire the plants back up to sell high priced electricity to Cali.
