&lt;&lt; I was thinking I could restore them back to good use with some work.  I 
have none in my bus now.  If they are available as a new repop in stainless, 
this seems like it would be worth it to me. &gt;&gt;
Hi Paul,
That is good to hear!  It is always nice to refurbish old parts, but the 
slider latches are one of those pieces that gets alot of stress over time.  
Then suddenly snap when for the umpteenth thousandth time someone releases 
the latch before the window has stopped sliding and the latch catches and 
stops everything from moving suddenly!  In otherwords if one has good slider 
latches only release them when you have the slider window stopped where you 
want it.  Eric&amp;Barb
