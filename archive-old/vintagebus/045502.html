Subject: Safari windows (was: Driving to OCTO sans windshield)
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

My brother, a San Jose cop, got back to me and said this about safari windows:
 
    &lt;&lt;There are a few codes that apply.  One is &quot;windshield requirements&quot;.  
Yes, 
there is a windshield there, but it is in the up position which makes it 
useless for its purpose as such.  Another is, &quot;defective vehicle equipment&quot;, 
which is a catch-all to any part of the vehicle.  That can be used because 
the windshield is up and is not being used as it should, to deflect road 
debris, insects, and wind which can distract the driver to safely operate the 
vehicle.  Another is if the safari window is half-way up, &quot;view obstructed&quot;, 
which can be used just like an air freshener tree or parking placard hanging 
from the rear-view mirror in the way of the driver's clear view through the 
windshield.  Another is, &quot;windshield wipers required&quot;.  Yes, you have two 
windshield wipers, but if the windows are up, usually the wipers are folded 
in making them useless.  The thing is, I would personally only cite someone 
if they were driving around town going over 25, or down the freeway with them 
up, because of the safety hazard it presents.  It's kinda weak to cite 
someone on any of these.  It's more of a probable cause to stop and then give 
a warning.  I'm pretty sure that you're not supposed to drive with them up 
anyway unless you are camping or safaring.  You are usually driving 15mph at 
the most when you do that.  Another one is the code we use on trucks with 
open camper shell doors.  You're not allowed to drive a vehicle with the door 
latch open.  It would be the same if you were driving around a squareback 
with the back door open, or a rear safari window open.  There are probably 
more codes that can apply since there are over 40,000 vehicle code 
violations.  But those are the only ones I can think of.  Think of this... 
San Jose's traffic enforcement team went to a factory and took a look at a 
car right of the factory line ready for sale in California.  They were able 
to cite that vehicle for 20 different things. 
    By the way, these are all infractions and correctable ... like I said 
it's 
kinda a waste to write a ticket on because all you would have to do to 
correct it is to shut them, lock it, fold your windshield wipers then find a 
cop to sign it off....&gt;&gt;
