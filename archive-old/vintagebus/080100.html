Subject: Those Little Window Latch Triangles

Gang:

For My 56 Kombi: I have two little triangles for the window latches, they
are flat have three holes and rounded corners and are about 1/8 inch thick.
I know that they go under the window latch to offset the latch from the body
so that the windows close right.  The problem is I can't remember which
latches they are for, is it the front side windows, the middle side windows
or the back.  One of the latches needs a little offset for the windows to
close right.  Please help.
