Subject: Re: [VB] scoops are cooler-electric fan q

So,what are scoops? High volume, high pressure? Lov volume, high pressure,
what? What do scoops give you that fans don't?

&gt; Speaking of electrics, has anyone tried an electric fan blowing INTO the
&gt; fan shroud opening to feed the generator fan?

It would just become a restriction. Even at idle, the stock fan is pumping
out some good air. Besides, most electric fans are high volume/low pressure.
You need pressure for the cooling system to force air past all the cooling
fins. 900 cfm won't do any good if it cant push it where it needs to go.
Plus, if you have a problem overheating while idling, something is definitly
wrong.  :-)
