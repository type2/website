&lt;&lt; What I need to know is,
 which company to go with when I buy the door and window seals.  Is there
 a company that has a reputation of good rubber products? &gt;&gt;
Hi,
We have found that Wolfsburg West makes the best repro rubber, but do not have
repro rubber as WCM, while WCM makes more pieces they have the tendency to use
a stiffer plastic feeling rubber.  WCM does order some of thier rubber from VW
and this is of excellent quality.  So order as much of your rubber from
Wolfsburg West and what they do not have order the rest from WCM.  As for
Safaries, nobody but VW made good seals as far as we have seen, the original
seals came with the corners molded into them so they would not wrinkle in the
corners.   Eric &amp; Barb
