Clara's mention of the &quot;clean and polish rebuild&quot; jogged my ancient memory.

When I was a kid patching up old junkers for wheels, I used to take
generators and starters to a little neighborhood FLAPS to have the armatures
checked with a &quot;growler&quot; and the commutators turned and recut.  They had a
little manually-operated machine that mounted on a bench top, and combined a
lathe and a cutter.  Worked really slick, and the whole job took around 15
minutes.

Does anyone else recall those machines, or know if they are still available?
I don't know an official name for the machine, but it sure would be handy to
have one.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  But since I can do the clean and polish rebuild on generators,  I now
have a stack of good generators out of my piles of mystery dead ones.  &lt;&lt;
