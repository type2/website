We have those up here, too.  You can't park in the driveway, can't do
your own gardening, can't do any car work - NOTHING!  They're striving for
a perfect, sanitary urban experience, and people are snapping those 
things up like crazy.

That is not the style of living I want, so I don't move there.  It doesn't
make any sense for me to move into one of those plastic communities,
put my car up on the lawn, and then try to change the law, now does it?

&gt; That being said, don't even think about moving to Irvine in Southern CA.  There are areas where the &quot;association&quot; tells you what you can do IN your garage and at what times you can have your garage door open and for how long.
