excellent advice kevin, that is exactly how it should be handled and 
positive results will follow...[no karma needed (IMHO)]

&lt;&lt;...The invoices should show that you had to pay a second time to have another
shop repair the _same_ problem or condition that you paid the 1st shop to
repair. It would help if you could convince the 2nd repair shop owner to
testify for you but it is not necessary. Also, make sure that the invoice
from the 2nd shop has the exact same description of the problem they are
repairing as the description reads on the 1st invoice.

Also, you should send a _polite_ letter to the 1st repair shop outlining 
the
problems or items that you paid them for that are still not repaired. Send
it registered mail, return receipt requested. In the letter, state that 
you
require that they respond to you within a reasonable amount of time (30 
days
or so) or you will be forced to take your car to another shop to have the
repairs done.

Another thing, when you talk to another shop, don't go off on the 1st
mechanic and how he screwed you. If you are too hysterical, they will 
think
that you are the problem and tell you to go elsewhere. Do tell them that 
you
had your car at another shop. Show them the invoices and ask them if they
think the 1st shop repaired the items listed on the invoice. Let them tell
you whether they think the 1st shop did or did not do the repairs 
correctly.
Stay calm.....&gt;
