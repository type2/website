Subject: My Picture in VW book

 Had a interesting thing happen monday at the bookstore.  I was flipping
through a VW book and stumbled accross a picture of me in it.  It
certainly suprised me.  The book is &quot;Classic Volkswagens&quot; from Osprey
Colour Classics.  Published in England.  It spotlights classic VW's from
bug's to bus's to other special VW's.  If anyone has this book, or see's
a copy, Look at page 127.  The kid in the middle of the page in the red
shirt is me.  17 years ago.  I was all of 10.  The guy looking back at
me is me dad.  This was taken at the SOTO 4th aniversary meet (When Jeff
Walters was in charge) in Garden Grove.  This was my first VW meet and i
probably had no clue at what i was looking at or that i would own many
bus's inthe next 17 years.  Anyway, i guess i have been published once
again.
It's a small world
