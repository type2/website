Subject: Is your thermostat clean?

I've been cleaning engine tins, painting them, and reinstalling everything
on a rebuilt 1600DP.  One task I always dread is getting the alignment of
the thermostat assembly just right so that the rod travels freely in order
for the thermostat to do its job.

I tested the thermostat from the original engine and it passed with flying
colors.  The test involves using an old metal pan with water and placing it
on the stove.  Only mild heat is required.  If the thermostat is working, it
will expand.  I found out long ago that too much heat will over extend the
thermostat and ruin it because it stretches out too far.

I found though that the next day, the thermostat was expanded - there was a
hole in it someplace that allowed it to take on water.  I was curious to
find out why it had leaked.  As it turns out, oil and gunk had seeped all
over it (common on old VW engines) and this in turn attracted dirt and tiny
rocks into the folds of the thermostat as it was fully expanded.  As the
thermostat contracted and expanded over time, one of the little rocks
successfully bored a tiny hole into the brass and ruined it.

I had to dig through my parts pile and I found one last greasy thermostat.
I tested it in mildly heated water and it performed beautifully.  But once
again, little stones and grime were trapped in the folds of the brass.  I
added some soap to the heated water and grabbed an old nylon scrub brush
(much like a stiff toothbrush for dentures).  Once the thermostat had
expanded thus, exposing its folds, I was able to grab hold of the end of it
with a pair of pliers and slowly rotate it around in the pan whilst
scrubbing the heck out of it.  As evidenced by the grime in the bottom of
the pan, I now have a truly clean thermostat that should last a good while
longer.
