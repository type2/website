Subject: Crankshafts Type IV

While at the crankshaft shop I was looking through the specs book to
check out possible availability of main bearing sets.
In the Type IV VW section it list a heavy or big journal crank.
I've never seen one of these.
Did they come in Porsche, Industrial Engines or where were they used?
I've found one with the big end rod set that goes with it. The rod
bearings are (appear to be) about the same size as the main bearing
diameter.
