Hey, I have this spare 67 12V wiper motor that I don't need (my bus is a
61). I don't know if it works or not, and I don't want to put it up for
sale if it doesn't work. is there any way to see if it'll work just by
using some jumpers or something and a 12V battery? If there is, what are
the contact numbers that I will have to jump? I don't have a spare switch,
just the motor. Also, if it does work, what's the normal going price for a
good 67 12V motor? thanks in advance for any replies.
