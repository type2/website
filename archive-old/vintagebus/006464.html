&gt;It seems strange that everyone is so resigned to think he might have
&gt;committed suicide. But from what everyone writes he doesn't seem to
have
&gt;had any reason to do that... &gt;For all we know he went into his
garage, started his car, and then had
&gt;something happened and he passed out... &gt;Greg


Not that it makes any difference now, but I was sort of wondering the
same thing. In my case, I think it's too scary to believe that someone
so seemingly happy and kind could actually commit suicide without
anyone having any clue.  Makes me start to wonder about lots of other
people close to me. Maybe we'd feel a _little_ better knowing he
didn't do it on purpose?  Just me trying to sort things out.
