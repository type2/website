I think Mark Was refering to the removal of the cab divider.
I guess the kombi Mike B. removed it from was out in the middle of knowhere, 
hudreds of miles from home, no power, no power tools, no generator and it was 
removed by hand.
ACTUALLY, i dont think he did a bad job considering what he had to work with.
MOST of the damage to the divider was done because the bus it came out of had 
a SERIOUS front end impact. Its all good now, Its restored...awaiting for me 
to get off my lazy ass and put it in a bus!
