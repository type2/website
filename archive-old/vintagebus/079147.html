Subject: Re: [VB] 12 volt flasher on 65 bus

http://www.thebugbox_dot_com/quickcircuit.jpg

Here's a diagram of what I'm talking about.  This is the cheapest way to
convert to 12 volts, and do away with the magic 'black box'.

I created this myself over 10 years ago, and have used it in at least 4
VW's.
I may not have been the first to do this, but I haven't seen anyone else do
it that I didn't tell them how.

If it doesn't make sense, I'll try to do a better picture, it was late, and
I was dead tired.

Later
Charles

&gt; Go to Wal-mart.  Buy the generic boat trailer light converter.  With some
&gt; creative wiring, the turn signal will only operate the turn signals, and
not
&gt; the brakes also,  they will be separate circuits.  Put both of these into
&gt; the box.  With this setup, you will just put one regular blinker relay
&gt; before the turn signal switch.  I've done it on at least 4 VW's to date.
