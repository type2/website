i dont ever drive any bus, no matter what gear ratios or size tires i have,
over 75 MAX and it's extremely rare for me to over 70 anyway.  the
reduction boxes are the obvious reason-- the bearings don't really
appreciate the excess speed. plus my non-gauged-except-for-idiot-lighted
engine doesn't like pushing it that fast, never has.  i usually cruise
between 60-70 no problem. i don't care if i'm going downhill with a tornado
for a tailwind, over 70-75 is too damn fast. IF I WANT TO GO FAST, I'LL BUY
A BMW!!! (oh wait, i did that................)  i did get a ticket for
doing 45 in a 30 zone with a 4.12 r/p, 195/70/14 tires, 1600sp......and no
other gauges than the stock idiot lights.  hey, does anyone know a good way
to kill gophers other than shooting the f*#kers?

&gt; Ok.  I know I'm asking for alot of &quot;yeah rights&quot;, but here it is.  What
is 
&gt; the fastest you have ever gotten your bus to? and have you ever gotten a 
&gt; speeding ticket on the open highway?  Please back up the high numbers
with 
&gt; hardware.
