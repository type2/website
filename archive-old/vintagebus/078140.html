Subject: RE: [VB] Starter adaptor to run engine on stand

Phil-
Sounds like you have a 6 volt bellhousing/adapter. Grind down the areas that 
are hit by the flywheel like you would have to do installing a 12volt 
flywheel in a 6 volt trans. Or else get a 12 vt trans case and cut it off at 
the starter side so  you can bolt it up by the 2 bolt holes ion that side/

Bob
