&quot;I have looked through the archives and cannot find the info I am looking 
for.  I see that westy interiors are listed as SO34, SO42 and SO44.  I would 
like to know the difference between these and is one more desirable than the 
other?&quot;


go to my website!!! all your prayers will be answered :-) follow the 
westfalia &amp; camper links.
