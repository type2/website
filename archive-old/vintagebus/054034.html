HELP!   But first a thank you to George Lyle =96 I replaced the =
alternator per
his instructions without removing the engine.  The mechanics of the
operation worked great however the red alternator light is still on =96 =
so I
replaced the Regulator (I did polarize it per manufacturers =
recommendation)
and its still burning bright!!!!    =20

Also =96 I am getting a very minor =93whine=94 sound when it is running =
that
