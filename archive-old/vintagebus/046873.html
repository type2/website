Subject: Re: [VB] lowered busses

I thought that was standard with lowered buses.

&gt; 
&gt;  I`m interested in finding out what size tires and wheel combo that
&gt;  anyone that has a lowered bus is using. I bought a 67 that was already
&gt;  lowered.
&gt;  When I have a decsent load up front my tires  hit the bottom of the bus 
when
&gt;  we hit a bump.
&gt;  Anybody have any suggestions?
