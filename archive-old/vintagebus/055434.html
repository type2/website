Subject: New Engine

I just came back from picking up my '67 with the new DP 1600 Mexico engine.
Wow, what a difference.  I have not had my bus for over four weeks and I was
suffering from withdrawl.  Seriously, I didn't realize how much I depend on
that bus to keep me centered.  When I get in pissy moods I take the bus out
for a drive and I am good again.  Who needs Paxil...I have a BUS!!!!

Thomas '67
