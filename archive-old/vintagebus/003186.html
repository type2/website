I just wanted to comment that &quot;Ginger Nipps&quot; is one of the coolest names on
the list.

Subject: [VB] re:transporting a bus


&gt; I recently sold a bus to a fellow in CA and he had a company pick up my
&gt; bus in Wyoming and deliver to LA for about $700.  A few other buyers
&gt; tried to get quotes but they were twice the price and backed out of the
&gt; deal.
&gt;
&gt; The company usually uses the big Semi trucks like the car dealers but in
&gt; my instance they used a flatbed that carried 3 vehicles.  Anyway the
&gt; actual company he dealt with was a local company that went through a
&gt; larger company www_dot_carmovers_dot_com
&gt;
&gt; The sunroof which was pretty rotten was pretty much gone from the wind,
&gt; but I kind of expected that to happen, other than that it showed up in
&gt; good shape.
