&lt;&lt; No.  According to the warranty all it said was 'within the first 1500
 miles'.  I'll keep an eye on it for sure.  BTW is there a way to
 retorque ALL the nuts without pulling the engine?  Honestly it's been more
like 200 miles (1 tank of gas) 
  &gt;&gt;
Hmm, definitely read the idiot manual and go by the directions there for head
installation.  No, you have to remove the engine and upper tin to retorque the
upper head nuts.  Have you been taking it easy on the engine driving in town
stop-go for the first 300-500 miles and stopping every 20-30 minutes to let it
cool down for at least 10 minutes.  A lot of heat is happening due to the
parts wearing/polishing in and can cause overheating and thusly stud pulling
if run hard during this time.   Eric &amp; Barb
