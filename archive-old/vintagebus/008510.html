Hey guys, what size wheels do you guys use on your buses? I'm not talking
about original ones though. I'm thinking, well I've got a set of nice
205X60X15 tires off my Bimmer and was wondering if at any point I can put
these on some nice rims and smack 'em on my bus. Would that look stupid?
What width rims should I use and which ones do you recommend? Should I do
it? I mean, my original tires on the bus are pretty much gone and the rims
need work anyway. What do you think?
