Subject: Single cab Question for the Gurus
To: ralexander03_at_snet_dot_net, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Question.
I have a 58 and a 59 single cab.
The 58 definatly has its original side gates.
The 59 appears to have the original gates since they are equally as beat as 
the rest of the truck.
On the 59, just above the hinges, there is an impression about 6 inches by 2 
inches.
Kinda like the big rectangle impressions but smaller at each hinge point.
The 58 doesnt have these impressions.
Is 58 and 59 the split cutoff for this?
Just curious. I never knew there was a difference before until now.
Thanks for the help or info.
Regards, Greg
