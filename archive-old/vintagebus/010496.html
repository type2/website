I can't

&gt; This, as far a I 
&gt; am concerned was the biggest mistake VW ever made and quickly 
&gt; led to the 70's 
&gt; decline of VW's market share, only to begin to recover just 
&gt; recently. 

Here in South Afrca much of the air cooled parts stock of dealers was
crushed when it was declared obsolete! VWSA appartently actively discourages
their dealerships from selling on their obsolete stock in favour of sending
it to the crusher. I can only imagine what sort of stuff was lost in this
way. I believe that this is a fairly common policy amongst manufacturers
internationally.
