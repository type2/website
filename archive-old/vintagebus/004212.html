Subject: Front Seat Bumpers??
Date: Sat, 26 Feb 2000 22:30:17 -0800

Hi Everyone,

    I'm itchin' to get this new upholstery on my front seats that I bought
thru Jonn _at_ Wolfsden Imports last summer(!), but before I do, I need to get
new seat bumpers that mount to the divider.  I'd hate to wreck the new
threads after it took so long to get around to doing it.  I checked the WCM
catalog and didn't see 'em listed.  Is there anyone out there that is
repro'ing these??  If not, does anyone have a set to sell??  Any leads would
be most appreciated.
