Subject: re: [VB] Jerome?

All I can say is that is was a &quot;Terrible&quot; weekend. Definite pun intended.
Explanation of the teaser photo will be posted. Jerome 2002 was a great time.
Was actually able to sleep Saturday night! =) I am not the anonymous
photographer but I did take tons of photos. Full report to follow. I will lay
back and allow the board of officers and/or the folks who were primary in
making the event happen post first.
Of course I encourage Everette to create a Jerome 2002 folder. I will up load
photos at first oppty.
