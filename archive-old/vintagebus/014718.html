today I got a call from a friend in tacoma saying that he just bought
A double door panel at a local auction for$160!!! since he is not a 
bus fan he is passing it along to me(for a small profit of course)
I dont know all the details yet ..I don't even know the year.
but I do know it is a splitty for sure and that the only rust  he could 
find is under the drivers side floor mat!!.and it was last licensed in 
97.it does have an engine that turns,front emblem,taillights and 
bumpers! who know it might be something worthy of shop truck 
treatment!

I will keep you guys posted...oh ya he's even going to deliver it to 
my hous 40mi away!!
