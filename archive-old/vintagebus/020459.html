Mark,&gt;   I really like the idea about the levis and
the&gt; pockets. That was me who &gt; wrote about the map
panels.  I am waiting until I&gt; can really do something
&gt; special with the door panels but I don't know what&gt;
yet.  In the mean time, &gt; no panels at all will work.&gt;
&gt; take it easy,&gt; Wayne&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that.Someone wrote about
someone doing a different&gt; &gt;approach on door
panels...with a map I think it&gt; &gt;was...I had a bad
panel on the cargo side door that&gt; &gt;gets most of the
use.I took some old levis and had&gt; &gt;good old Mom sew
them together with the&gt; pockets(front&gt; &gt;and back ones)
close together then I wrapped that&gt; &gt;around the
original panel.I got a side door with&gt; &gt;storage for
little items in those pockets.Just&gt; wanted&gt; &gt;to say
Hi, and do my part in keeping the list alive&gt; &gt;and
kick'in.  Mark and his 67 Deluxe.....Old Levi?&gt;
&gt;aaahhh.......&gt; &gt;&gt;

Wayne !  I liked the idea of not making our split
windows to much of a jewel that hides in a garage.They
need some character sort of reflect the owners style.I
saw a picture of one where the lady used bamboo to do
a Hawaiian theme.I have not done to much to mine
yet...if it runs I am happy with that.....Later..Mark
and his 67 Deluxe...&quot;No Name&quot; ?....aaahhhh maybe
