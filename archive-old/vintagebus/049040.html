 A non listee friend of mine here in Fresno has a nice 23 window he found in AZ. Nice until someone popped out all his skylights a few nights ago. Seals too. 
There's no way to track 'em down, and probably stolen to order and won't be on the market. 
So, he's looking for a set. Would appreciate info on recent costs for 'em too. 
While on this subject, has anyone etched their driver's license or VIN # near the edge of windows to ID these pieces? I know it's been done on newer cars as a deterrent. I've seen acid etching kits at craft stores. Come to think of it, a Sigla stencil could be cut and applied too.
