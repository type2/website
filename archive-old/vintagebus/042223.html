It sounds to me like its flooding. My first thought is a leaky float
valve. 


&gt; me. 1963 bus, 1600 dual port, 009, 34-pict carb. Timing is set correctly, 
&gt; valves adjusted. 

&gt; times, then hold it completely on the floor until started. If you just 
&gt; pump the gas while turning it over, then it won't start. This even 
&gt; happens after it's been well warmed up. I have tried adjusting the idle 
&gt; and mixture screws, but to no avail...
&gt; Also, the bus gets like 12 miles per gallon, which is horrible...
&gt; It runs fine (other than the gas mileage) once you start it, doesn't 
&gt; stall out or anything.
