Subject: Re: [VB] Truck show class

And how about the ultimate insult:  You enter your DC in a show and find 
out there actually is a 'Truck' class, only to discover that you've been 
lumped in with the RABBIT PICKUPS!!  (BTDT--twice!)

&gt;&gt;Well, now I'm really upset! My 63 double cab is a factory 12 volt. It is a
&gt;&gt;TRUCK, not a bus but when I go to a show, do they have a class for TRUCKS ?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;No, they put me in a class with 300 BUSSES and I don't never win nothing.
&gt;&gt;whimper, whimper, whine.

&gt; Be happy with your truck and get use to getting passed over! Commercials are 
&gt; usually lumped in with everything else. Good luck getting a trophy when your
 &gt; truck is competing against a 23 window barndoor (or even post BD for 
that matter)
 &gt; for votes, no matter if it is a much better resto. I doubt even David 
Mayes truck
 &gt; could pull off a win (when finished) which is a real shame. Everyone 
knows
 &gt; commercials are the coolest *ducks for cover*
