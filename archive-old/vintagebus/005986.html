&gt;     I am thinking of a shift-by-wire system... sensor box under the
shifter,
&gt; different signals for each gear, built-in interlock system, 'lectric servo
box
&gt; on nosecone... hm. something for the MEs to chew on. For the right price
it
&gt; would eliminate the shift geometry problems of most vws, as well as the
&gt; midengine apps and so on... and it'd sell, too...
&gt;

OH NO!!   Sounds like what Renault did in the late 60's on the R-10 and
Dauphine. They had a pushbutton electric stickshift. It had a pushbutton
unit, a control unit, an electric motor on the shift cover of the
transmission, and an electro-magnetic clutch [it used 6 brushes. I still
have the tool for replacing the brushes]. It was a nightmare from hell!!!
When it broke down, not if but when, you went to the car with a big suitcase
and plugged a big connecter in. From the suitcase you could drive the car,
everything but steer it.
You don't want to go there!!!
