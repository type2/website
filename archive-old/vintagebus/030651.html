&gt; I think MOST people think in general &quot;it's your bus, do what you want&quot;.

Right there you said it all...... I'm a *FIRM* believer in that statement.
*I* do what *I* want with my cars, VW or otherwise. When it comes time to
sell them, *I* ask what *I* want for them. Sure there are alot of people who
will say, &quot;oh that's too much money&quot; on the other side of that coin are the
people that will say, &quot;hey, that's just what I'm looking for and someone else
did all the work for me&quot;

I was talking with a guy today about Kelly Park and he asked me if I was
going to bring my 'vert or my Oval to put in the show. My response... No. I
build cars for myself to enjoy the way I like them. No way am I going to put
them into a show for every &quot;expert&quot; to pick apart for correctness. That will
happen, trust me. You could have the most perfect example of *any* car and
sure enough some yahoo that thinks he knows better will make it a point to
tell you this is wrong, or so an so should be this color. These are usually
the guys paying other &quot;mechanics&quot; to do their work for them and wouldn't know
how to change a set of points in their cars to get it home if it broke down.
These people I could care less about, especially their opinions about my
cars.

Do with them what you want, and when you're done sell it for what you want to
someone who will enjoy it. Like Thom said as soon as they start pointing at
what's &quot;wrong&quot; with it that's when it's time for them to move along somewhere
else
