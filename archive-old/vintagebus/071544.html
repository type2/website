Subject: Re: [VB] re:we are home

diane,
was it ever verified that the sound you heard was the engine flopping around
back there or are you using your imagination based on the noises you hear.
if a couple of your spring plate bolts are loose it could sound like your
engine or tranny flopping around back there when you shift.  ive missed a
lot of this thread so i may be way off.  i check those on every new bus i
get and they always seem to be loose.

&gt; I see the cross brace he put in...as far as I know you should not need
this
&gt; for your bus, this is only for later buses...
