Duck,

I wish you busloads of luck.  This is from a guy who when through the pain of
the same thing.
I was able to get extension after extension based upon trying to get a
transmission from Todd Hill, but after 6 months, they pulled the plug on me.
You are lucky with that provision.  In my city, the allowance for working on the
vehicle is made with the limit of 72 hrs max.  Our code enforcement officer
understood what I was going through since her brother owned a splitty.  Her
patience went only so far though.

Get reciepts for EVERYTHING.  Even if its just a part here or there so you can
keep a paper trail of work being done.  That's one thing that kept getting me
extensions.  I'd show them the emails from Todd claiming to be working on it,
&quot;its not done yet&quot;, etc.  One thing cities can't argue with is a paper trail.
(Never did get the trans from Todd, had to grab an old one from a friend and
drop it in to get the DC on the road.  It died 1000 miles later.  The DC is now
happy with it's Rancho trans)

Like I said, a busload of luck to you,

Scott
'60 DC
