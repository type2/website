Subject: Progress on the '67 brakes
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.05.10004082025080.12680-100000_at_mtolympus.ari_dot_net&gt;

Volks,

I made a lot of progress on installing the new brake system on the '67.  I
have installed the metal lines in the rear and the shoes and spriongs on
the left rear.  I have run into a bit of a problem on the right rear,
tho...  the brakes were frozen to the drum solidly and removing the drum
took the mongo-sized drum puller.  In the process, we pried the hod-down
spring off their pins, bent the shoes in the cylinders, and bent the
adjuster bolts, and bent the spreader bar for the parking brake.  I
thought this would not be a problem, the shoes and
hardware were already on the shopping list, and I knew new adjuster were
available, and I thought I could bend the spreader bar back into shape.

Well, the hardware and shoes are still not a problem but... When I went to
buy new adjusters today, tho, it seems that the new adjuster bolts have a
wider, shallower slot and the slot runs at about a 15 degree angle.  And
when I went to bend the spreader bar back, it broke :-(

First, does anyone have a spare spreader plate (passenger's side)?  (the
bar that goes between the shoes and that the parking brake arm prys
against)  I suppose my old one could be welded up, but talk about a PITA!

Second, despite the wider, shallower cut and the angled bottom, I *think*
that the new-style adjusters will work... if not, tell me now :-) I would
love to know before I start driving.  And of course, if not, does anyone
havea any spares of the older adjuster screw?

Next-to-lastly, Ron (Bus Depot) sells a length of metal line to go on the
driver's side rear between the &quot;T&quot; and the flex hose.  the original is
~6&quot;, the replacement is ~8&quot; (this is the shortest standard length sold,
BTW).  It is a *major* PITA to use up that extra 2&quot;!  If the length were
longer, you could make up a loop somewhere and hide it nicely, but in only
6&quot;, there is nowhere to go :-( Does anyone make a *correct* length
replacement line?  anyone have a swager and want to get into the biz?  I
would certainly be in the market!

Finally, a couple months ago, Ron (Bus Depot, again) advertised OEM-style
replacement shocks.  There was some discussion at the time as to whether
they would fit the front only or front and rear.  I got a set, and I
installed one on the rear without significant problems, so... if you want
this style (there was discussion at the time as to whether these or
gas-a-justs were better) and he still has any (Ron?) then go ahead and
order... they will fit front and rear.
