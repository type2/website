Subject: RE: [VB] &quot;Roof&quot; Rack mounted on the rearbumper and backdoor  

Lars wrtoe: &gt;&gt;Anyone know were to buy this or is't homemade (i would like 
some drawings) ? &lt;&lt;

Hi Lars,
It was a homemade job, and a bad idea.  Just an easier way to the body work 
of your bus messed up!  Best to just get a real roof rack or trailer if you 
need more cargo capacity.  Eric&amp;Barb
