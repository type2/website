&gt;What is the collective wisdom on the knock-off wrenches for the rear
&gt;axle nut? You know, the ones that you hit with a small sledge to turn? I
&gt;carry one in my road kit, since I don't carry an impact gun. But given
&gt;the choice I use a socket and impact.


What George said made sense to me.  I was the one who suggested a knock-off
wrench for Bob.  I've always used the socket and jump on the cheater method
til last summer when I had a loose transaxle laying in the bed of my pickup
that needed to be dissassembled.  I don't know how I could have ever got the
nut off with the breaker bar.
I bought one of those knock offs and it worked great.  I'll definitely carry
it on the road with me, but if you think about it, you are kind of banging
on the bearings with it, so I think I'll try and use the breaker when I can.
