Subject: Rain and Electrics

Today was a rainy day in lower CA.  I took the 67 (which had been
running perfectly) out to return a tow bar to a friend, and anything
that could go wrong on the beast ....did!

First, engine vibration rotated the generator  180 degrees to the left,
testing the upper strength limits of the wires attaching it to the reg.
A 1/2 hour by the side of the road with everything but the 13 mm I
really needed to synch the gen. strap back down and I was going again.
I need a new strap I think.

Next, the carb would not run good at part throttle at all.  So I had to
run at full throttle or idle.  I think it must be a clogged jet.  I
tried the hand over the throat while it was running trick...did'nt help
much.

Finally, just as I entered the street to where I was going I noticed a
clicking coming from the 12V blinker box (67 only).  Then as I attempted
to shut the bus off, nothing happened.  It continued to run on!  Not
dieseling just idling normally.  What the fu$k!  I went back to ground
the choke wire to kill it and burned my finger.  The choke wire was
completely melted.  Short I guess.  But why??

We checked the ignition switch...it was good.  Eventually I realized
that the hot lead and the lead to the coil had melted together.  That
fixed, the starter would work, but no oil and gen. lights....and the
engine will fire for a short burst and then die.

No power to the coil???

This is where I stopped....too wet and dark to continue.  Any
suggestions on where to check next.  Might the lead from the front to
the coil be shorted in another place?   Reg. be fried from this??  Why
would the lead from the coil hot to the choke have melted?  Did the
choke break and short to the carb body??

Thanks for any help folks!!!

BTW, thanks Matthew for the tow back home!!

Steve
