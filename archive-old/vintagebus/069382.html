&gt; machinist called me and sounded puzzled... 'the one head has two CAST

&gt; TOO SHORT and don't completely come up to the combustion chamber!'

Hi Craig,
Hmm, those cast iron guides are allright unless you park the engine for a 
long period and have the guides rust to the valves!  We agree with having 
them bored and bushed with bronze as your machinist suggested.  Definitely 
wierd about the too short ones.

&gt; lastly, is anyone hoarding a nice set of stock 1500/1600rocker arms? 
&gt; i am likely going to use a scat rocker shaft  because all my vw shafts are 
&gt; galled to some degree ar another; and while a local brake shop can hone my 
&gt; existing rocker arms to clean them up, he wanted a LOT to do it :P  

you should be able to clean those up yourself with a good fine flat file and 
a honing tool for alot less!
