Subject: FMV - early door?
Mime-Version: 1.0


What's the going rate for a nice, straight, dry driver's side door, sans
glass for an early bus?  It would have to be packed up shippied across the
country as well.   I've seen them as high as $150 at swaps, but
unfortunately most of the lower-priced ones I've seen are junk.  I'm not
trying to retire on them (I have social security for that :) )

(FMV: fair market value)
