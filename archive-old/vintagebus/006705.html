Airfares, ouch, it looks like I'm doing to fly into Des Moines, Iowa instead
if Cedar Rapids to pick up the bus, the air fare is about half as much, the
PO are going to tow the bus and meet me at the airport and my journey will
begin from there. First stop will be Omaha Nebraska where I hope to rest up
and meet the listys from there, then down to I 40 where i hope to meet some
more listys between Nebraska and New Mexico, where I will rest again then
off to Albuqerque to stay with JP and the boys from there to Flagstaff Az.
to visit with Mark (look at the single cab he has for sale) then off again
back to Lake Havasu, if all goes well I'm looking at 4 days traveling
barring any problems and if I don't find anything along the way.1760 miles.

this journey will be in a 1961 single cab with side loader, just like a
Corvair Greenbrier, with a stock 40hp in it.


ronnie  (just something to do)

ps. will have with me, extra fuel pump, generator and regulator, rocker
assembly, belts and pulleys, brake cylinders and hoses, assorted bearings
and seals, tools of self destruction, and other miss. parts for the road,
the PO's will furnish jack and spare tire. Other necessities will be picked
up on the road, printed out all Wally Worlds and Super K's in route, will
have the AIRS guide and the NEATO road book with me, along with my cell
phone.

exact date still to be determined
