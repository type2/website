Subject: Re: [VB] Full fow oil pump?

&gt; I think someone installed the cover incorrectly.  Twist that bad boy around
&gt; 90 degrees pointing left.

I looked again and there are two outlets/inlets on the cover. One is positioned a 9 o'clock and
another is at about 4 or 5 o'clock. Both have a steel tube attached that is cut-off and bent over to
seal it.

&gt; Also there should be a tapped hole in the case if it is to run full flow.
&gt; Again look at the left hand side of the case and follow the oil flow tube
&gt; bulges around to see it there is a hole (and no it is not the oil pressure
&gt; sender hole).

There are no tapped holes in the case.

&gt; It is possible that someone slapped on a full flow cover by accident on a
&gt; non-tapped case... It just would not run this way :(

The cover is definitely there and there are no holes in the case. I know the engine runs because I
drove it before I parked it to start the restoration on the body. Since both inlets on the cover are
blocked-off, I suppose its just acting like a standard pump, right? If so, any drawbacks to just
leaving it as it is?

&gt; There are a few tricks to the full flow process so if you are unsure on what
&gt; you have I would bring it to someone to check out first...  If there is a
&gt; plug in the oil galley after the pump you have an engine that will explode
&gt; in about 10 minutes because of a blocked oil passage.

Believe it or not, I used to be a VW mechanic but, I never worked on modified engines,  just
stockers.  I don't want to take it to a shop because I would rather do my own work. Besides, this
list has more knowledge and better advise than just about any mechanic I may find around here.
