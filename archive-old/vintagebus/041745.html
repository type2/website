&gt; I think I can shed some light here, I work for a fuel company in Phx. We haul 
&gt; for a lot of places, I was shocked to find out that Chevron is the only place 
&gt; that uses a set of racks, no one else can load from these racks, 76 has its 
&gt; own rack, and Arco has its own rack. Now Arco, and 76 both sell to any one! 
&gt; So you could be at a local &quot;independent&quot; type store and get 76 gas. Now this 
&gt; is my point! We have a set of racks called Kinder (Censored), we've hauled 
&gt; for 6 different stations out of this one set of racks.

Shhh!  You're giving away the secret!  All of these companies have gone to
great lengths and expense to give the public the idea that their fuel is
somehow superior to others.  In fact, the suppliers share and trade
fuel freely, pipe it from here to there in the same pipelines, etc.  Next
thing you know you'll have the bus folk all buying from the cheapest
stations because they will all know that the fuel is the same!  :)

&gt; The octane is the same for each different grades of gas unlead is 87 mid is 
&gt; 89 and high grade is 96. Some times we will be loading and the octane alarm 
&gt; will go off at the minimal amount and will not inject any more then that,

This is a new one on me.  Is there a device that will detect the octane of
a fuel (normally determined on a calibrated test engine) on the fly?  Or
is the device simply a mechanical proportioning device?
