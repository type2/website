&gt; Subject: [VB] RE: Pitman Arm
&gt; 
&gt; 	Has anyone recently replaced the bushing/bearings of the pitman
&gt; arm? Also can it be done in the vehicle and is it hard to do?

Those are the brass bushings for the swing lever, right?  I thought
those were a real bear to get out, but did it with the front axle on the
car.  I know I pounded it out with a hammer (it was several years back),
I think using a gizmo I got through JC Whitney that has a bunch of metal
cylinders of different sizes that screw onto a metal rod that you can
use to pound bushings out.  Have no idea what the set is called. You can
attach a cylinder that closely fits the bushing you're working on;
there's a little shoulder so it stays in place. Works pretty well, but
they were in there tight. I may have put a jack under the tool to push
up, since there isn't much room to swing a hammer.  With the front end
on the car, you can't very well use a hydraulic press to push them out.
You could also try working your way around pounding using a large pin
punch, but that would be awkward and run the risk of slipping and
scratching up something.

Even more unorthodox (some people will probably be horrified) is that
instead of reaming out the inside of the bushings like you're supposed
to do, I used a small brake cylinder hone from a Flaps attached to an
electric drill.  It took a lot of time to get the inside diameter big
enough for the big rod to fit into, but it got there eventually.  You
can use the bushing pusher gizmo to get them into where they go once you
get the i.d. to the right diameter.
