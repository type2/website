&gt;Has anyone on the list tried using an external cooler cooled by a
&gt;electric fan? If so what was the results? Was it cool enough or not? Did
&gt;you have to make any duct work for it?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks, Rocky

I had a bus I sold (a 69 westy, ok dont get bunged, the engines still a type 
1 and the theory is the same......) and when I bought it back some years 
later a 1776 had been put in by a shop that mounted a oil cooler with a fan 
in the left side of the engine compartment. Now wait! The left side where 
the battery isnt. They cut away the metal in the pan and put the cooler so 
that the air would blow down accross the cooler and out the bottom of the 
bus. A switch was placed on the dash to turn this on when needed.
Ok did this work? Well by using a oil temp sender in the pressure relief 
valve, you could turn on the fan, and yes oil temp quickly dropped.
However, in discussion with others, I feel that this was an inappropriate 
solution. Head temps are very important. Oil will cool the p/c to some 
degree, but one must look at why the engine is running hot, even with an oil 
cooler. I feel that if compression ratios are good, all tin is in place, and 
the stock cooler is at least a dog house, you should get reasonable temps.
If you feel you need more cooling, I would suggest doing a little more work 
and fit a type 4 cooler. Why? More hoses are more cause for leaks. Work on 
realistic solutions to heat, rather then band aids.

BTW that engine is now in my 70 non pop top and I am working on getting a 
guage to see what its doing, but as far as I can tell from the dipstick 
test, it isnt running hot.
