Subject: IRS boot

Hi lists,

my '66 bus has a type-1 trans and IRS (double joint).
Yesterday I found the IRS boot torn, and trans oil leak.

The Idiot's book says that the IRS boot is nothing to do with 
the trans oil leak but only protects the CV joint from dust.

Supposing Muhr is right, should I change the side trans seal also?
If so, can I go through without pulling the engine?

I know here is a 'vintage' bus list, but
I need any help from those who know IRS system. Thanks.
