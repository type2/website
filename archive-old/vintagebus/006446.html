They do make 6-volt bulbs for the H4s, but not (as far as I can tell) for
the DOT approved H2s.  I have these 6-volt lights in my '66 Beetle, and when
they get full voltage they are plenty bright.  If you don't fix the voltage
drop, though, they're just as dim as the sealed beams.  H4s aren't a
band-aid for weak electrical.  I ran a relay to them to get around the old
wiring -- even after cleaning all the connections I had enough drop to keep
the lights from shining at full power.

The 6-volt bulbs cost quite a bit more than their 12-volt cousins, I recall
paying around $14 per bulb.

&gt; Yes, Yes, Yes. IT is the only way to go. I run them on all of my cars. I
&gt; believe they even make 6 volt bulbs for them but I am not sure. In my 60
