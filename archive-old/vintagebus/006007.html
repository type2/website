 The Prescott show was GREAT. Cool pines to camp in and show on the cool
grass. Was 105 in Havasu, 80 in Prescott. 45 when we left this morning
around 6 and 97 in Havasu when got home around 10. Missed Jerry and his
announcing ( never thought I would say that ). The club people did a great
job, but nothing like a pro, even they said they missed you Jerry. No toss
your nuts or anything like it. The show gets better each year and is
starting to fill the field. The best thing were the event t-shirts from Al,
they had a great bus on them this year, will be a collector item.

 With a type 4 cooler add an extra 1/2 qt. oil, 3 total. Run 20/50 for
cooler operation. Alaska had 30 and was running alittle hotter than normal.
Changed to 20/50 and said it was running cooler. Hotter in the lower 48 this
time of year than in Alaska, I guess. Oil my experience only, 31 years in
Havasu driving them every day, do what you want and read  up on it.

 Making a drawing of the alum steeringwheel puller and will have it
available to Everetts page shortly.

 Anyone coming for the Classic weekend from back east and wants to stayover
in Havasu Thurs and caravan with us Fri email me for directions. The Havasu
caravan will be meeting up with the Phoenix caravan at the Patton Tank
Museum at 10 AM Friday morning for the cruise into Yuccipa and the Christmas
tree island campout. Ronnie is also taking anyone who wants to go to Lennys
show on Fri afternoon leaving from c.t.i. and returning for camping Fri PM.
