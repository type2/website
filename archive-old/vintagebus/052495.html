Evidently .art files are some sort of proprietary AOL format. I was 
going to convert them to jpegs for you but Graphic Converter refuses to 
open them, apparently for legal reasons. Ah well. Maybe Steve Case will

&gt; Location is Eugene, Oregon.  As for viewing art. files, you got me, 
&gt; I've been
&gt; to sights with art files and the pics come up just like jpg's.  The 
&gt; pages
&gt; should just load normally.
