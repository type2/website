hi, my name is cory and i recently bought a really nice 66 kombi. i am 
fairly new in the vw world, but love it. im 15 and my bro (19) owns a 71 
karmann ghia. we are a vw family. i subscribed to this mailing list to meet 
new friends and tap into the whole bus world. anyways, im know a little bit 
about vw's and i was hoping to gain some knowledge about it with you. i hope 
that we can get to know eachother...

cory
