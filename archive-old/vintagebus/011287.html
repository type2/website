Pre-58 Westy Information    Sep. 28, 2000 Price:        ???? 
I need information/parts to help restore my October 1955 westfalia 
camper. Need color samples/paint codes for the kacki/mustard paint 
scheme, did westfalia use two toned rims or bumpers on any of these? 
Does anyone have a set of silver tent poles I can check out? Are there 
any differences in the poles aside form color? Anyone have an extra 
clamp for a 56 era westy roof rack? Also need a few interior coat hooks. 
Were the rear cabinets bolted down or did they just sit in place? Anyone 
reproduce the original style laquer decals for the interior? Any ideas 
on curtain materials? Also interested in purchasing any literature 
showing this color scheme. TIA for any help and/or leads. Regards, Greg
