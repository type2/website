Yes, you are right, I haven't been doing radios, maybe someday again, just not recently. Anyway, try Nick Stokes at Dub~Tunes radio page: http://homepage.mac_dot_com/stokester/dub_tunes

I can't say if he works as cheaply as I did, but people seem to be happy with 
the results.

Brad Clausen


 Anyway I am looking for
&gt; someone that works on these old radios. I read about &quot;Brad Clausen&quot; also
&gt; in the archives and tried to visit his old web page (
&gt; http://home.att_dot_net/~b-clausen/index.html ), but apparntly he is not
&gt; doing this type of work any more. Anyone have any leads to someone else
&gt; that does VW radio restoring/repairing?
