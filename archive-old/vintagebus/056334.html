Oops!  Meant to say I could only put in 10 gallons, not 15.

  Subject: [BSKA] Tank size - 10 Gallon?



    Anyone know what size tank is standard equipment in a '58 single =
cab? The PO of mine said he put in a larger tank and I was thinking Bay =
tanks were 15 gallons.  I ran out of gas the other day and when I filled =
up I only could put in 15.  Didn't put in that much from the gas can.  =
Anyone know?

    -Dan
