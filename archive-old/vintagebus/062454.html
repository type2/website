Subject: RE: [VB] taking out the speedometer

Hi Jay,

I just did this a few weeks ago. There are two screws (1 each side) that
hold it in from the back. Loosen them quite a bit and then rotate the
speedo counter clockwise to release it. Make sure you have the speedo
cable out if you want to get far with it. If you want to have it all the
way out, the parcel tray needs to be removed.

If it's just a few wires, I would suggest working with it in place. Lots
easier in the long run...

My $0.02,
