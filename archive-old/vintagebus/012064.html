Subject: Truck bumpers and VW Slavery

Had one and have been doing that...

The '57 single cab that I drove for years and was the origin of the &quot;Rusty
VanBondo&quot; name had a perfect ribbed rear truck bumper with the brackets.
Where it and the other many juicy bits went will remain a mystery. I am
sworn to silence.

VW Slavery? Pffft! Try wrenching on my piece of chit '63 EZ Camper *every*
weekend since July to keep it running as a daily cross-town commuter.
Wrenching on Sunday night whether we feel like it or not has become a family
routine. (Say what?) Paula and I don't have a late model Buick or anything
as a modern backup. We are all VW and hot air.
My neighbors think I'm obsessive and convulsive! ;-) I have been working on
my buses so much that my name is on the pooplist gossip trail with the clubs
that I'm in for not doing enough. Hey, once I get my own chit on the road
and get a glimmer of a career going then we'll talk about it. Its a hobby,
not Peyton Place for gosh sakes. I had been chasing leaking rear brake seals
for weeks, trying to narrow the long throw of the shift lever to increase my
chances of hitting a gear now and then -whew, quick breath here,- and
constantly try to get the &quot;new&quot; motor to run right. 
Resolution to the problems? Well, I figured out that the shop in Glendale
Arizona that has nothing to do with the first AZ Bus Club member and is
located very near the street named similarly to the town in which it
resides, sold me a motor as &quot;new&quot; with cylinders so fugged that the rings
lined up on all cylinders. Ive had cheap dates with more compression and
less gap... There was more scoring in them, under the carbon deposits than
in a typical late night weekend movie on the Cinemax channel!
The brake seals in the rear end and the shifting was globally blamed on a
shell of a tranny and ignorance of the punk who did the brake job &lt;old whats
iz name&gt;. What? you mean you have to replace ALL of those O rings? I'll be
darned. The Havasu/Rancho replacement tranny is great.

To escape the slavery, all I have to do now is chase the exhaust leaks,
figure out or replace the carb problems, get decent tires on the right sized
wheels, do the overhead air flap replacement and fluff up the pile of
blankets that I have covering the seat springs. Maaco and the upholstery
shop might have to wait until at least after I kick Kyles' pigheaded butt in
the camp set up at Havasu. More on that later! Stretch bus? Yeah, like
WHAT~EVER! ;-) Once at Havasu, I'll have to wander over for the &quot;mandatory&quot;
inspection and hang out just so I won't be talked about all weekend... My
vote actually goes toward Nurse Casey's cool awning set up. Kyle's family
and mine better park very near each other just to keep an eye on Nurse
Casey. I think that the whole list oughta show up just to see what I mean.
Superbowl weekend? Pfft! no probs if you have enough battery power for a TV
and a margurita blender. Um, can I borrow a flashlight and a shift coupler?
