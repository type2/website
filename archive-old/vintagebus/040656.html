I measure the carb output by removing the carb from the engine, squirting
the gas into a beaker, and then using a diabetic syringe to draw the gas
into for measurement. The syringe is .5 cc max. Ask a druggist what is the
best way to get one in your state.

&lt;&lt; I looked at the accelerator pump, and it squirts gas alright.  I think
the
&quot;squirt amount&quot; is also adjustable by changing the pump rod.  Should I try
to
change this so it squirts more gas?  Or is it something else? &gt;&gt;
Hi Christen,
Could be, but first would check your pilot and main jet sizes first and then
tune it according to the instructions we have in the type2 library!  If it
still does not work get a graduated test tube to measure the accelerator
pump
output to the factorey specs.  Also test your distributor for advance on
another VW.  Eric&amp;Barb
PS Does anyone know where we could get a graduated test tube for 0 to 5 ccs?
