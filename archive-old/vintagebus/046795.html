year is not 0,  what you have there is day/month, as in 8th Novemeber. 

what year?   go by the VIN.  from 65 the first digit of the bottom right 
number is the model year.     if it is around  1 180 567, it was buildt late 
63 for the 64 model year.

Thom, as this topic comes up often, perhaps you could put a small explanation 
on your website?

OK I admit it I have to ask the class a dumb question.

I picked up a m-plate at a swap last year for a quarter and just found it in a
drawer.  I went to put it in Thom's registry but was stymied by the date.   
The
first line is    08 N  .  I can guess that it is November 8, but what year 
would
&quot;0&quot; be??  '60??

Based on this:

&quot;Until 1963, this was a 5-digit number, using the European day/month/year
standard. After 63, they switched to a 3-digit system, with the first two 
digits
representing the day, and the second representing the month. 1 through 9 were
used for January through September, with the letter &quot;O&quot; for October, N for
November, and D for December.&quot;

the 3 digit numbering system must be after 63?  Any idea?  I know this is 
simple
for someone.  I've lost my SSVC booklet.  It explains it in great detail.

Thanks.

Anyone need a Kombi M-code tag??
