OK since it's Friday. The best one I ever saw was on a mid 80's Rolls Royce
Camargue(this was the top of the range at the time)in a crappy part of
Johannesburg called Hillbrow. Sticker was placed 'discretely' below the rear
bumper alongside the exhaust pipe.

It read '*uck the poor'. I was driving(my bus) at the time and laughed so
hard that I very nearly crashed.

Later
