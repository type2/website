I used to drive motorhomes for commercials for production companies, I got
paid 125.00 a day as a driver for 8 hours and another 25 dollars an hour
overtime. The average shoot was 12-15 hours, in the boring times I helped as
a PA, the pay sucked for the hours and the work. The job of the production
company was to bring a shoot in on budget. They have to take all factors
into consideration, that is why they offer so much for a VW Bus, it has to
fit in the budget. Most people love to let them use there vehicals, as being
on a shoot is a very interesting experience, along with the pay and the free
food etc. So if you have a vehical take the pay, hang out eat great food and
have something to tell your grandkids about. Look that is my bus in that
commercial or movie.

&lt;&lt;me know.  They pay good money - in the region of  £100 / day, and you
can drive it to the set
to keep an eye on it.&gt;&gt;

Good Money?? Doesn't that convert to about $200 or $250 a day??

If I were putting my vehicle in a commercial, my contract with them
would have to stipulate that I be there. And my day rate is at least
that much. Personally, I don't think anyone should provide a vehicle
unless the day rate is at least $400. These people (ad men) can and
should pay adequately.

I once had to provide my services for a commercial and I gave em a price
in the stratosphere (at least thats what I thought). They didnt even
blink. My price included supplies so I hit em hard again on that end.
Naturally, they never called me again. But they weren't going to
anyways. These ad people think their crap is odorless. And they think
you should just be oh so thrilled to be working with them. Actually,
it's the other way around. Make em pay, I say.
