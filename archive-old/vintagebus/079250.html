Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Wing window Latch

  I stock the new WW vent wing latchs, these are ones they make them selves. Much better then the Brazilian ons, 
even though I have had many problems with them (there are 3 manufaturers of these), good better and best.
  One of the reasons you are breaking them is the tips are to long and need to be files down. Even WW new ones 
need this to be done or you could break tose also. If you don't care about real shiney, try and find a good used one. I 
buy up all the cheep window frames I find at swaps just to get the good latchs off of them.

  Brax is in Cali right now. I saw him this weekend and should be back by this weekend

&gt;Hello Everyone 
&gt; 
&gt;    I have now bought four of these Brazilian POS wing window latches that
&gt;have all failed on me. I got the last one tonight and turned it and the
&gt;handle broke right off. They are made out of pot metal and where they all
&gt;break is at the shaft the lock pin slides back and forth one. Can some one
&gt;tell me where I can get a good latch. Or if they have a drivers side bus
&gt;wing window latch around I could buy. I can use the passenger side bug latch
&gt;early as well.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;Thanks for you help,
