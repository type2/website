&lt;&lt; On one of my engines, (DP 1600), there were spacers between the rocker arms
 and the heads (o-rings beneath the spacers), the other had none.  What's the

Hi Christain,
Once upon a time that one head was flycut to restore the flat sealing 
surfaces so it would seal to the cylinders, or the areas that the cylinders 
at the case where remachined so the cylinder would be square to both the case 
and heads.  This leads to the push rods being suddenly too long.  If only a 
small amount they can be shimmed to restore the proper valve to rocker arm 
geometery to prevent rapid and nasty valve guide wear.  In other words the 
valve lash adjusting screw must be straight to the valve stem halfway through 
the the motion of the valve being pushed open.   Eric&amp;Barb
