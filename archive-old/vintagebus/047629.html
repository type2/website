Subject: Contitech fan belt stretching
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Does any one use these belts? I've had 6 belts on three different cars 
stretch out to zero shims within a few hundred miles. were I buy these belts 
they tell me they had no problems with them. Richard and dawn had the same 
problem with contitech when I saw them at Busses and Balloons.
I've gone to a Kelly groove belt and so far so good.
Problem belts are Contitech 9.5 X 905 C9 made in Germany.
I've replaced both pullys(lined up correctly) and yes I do adjust the tension 
correctly.
What gives?
