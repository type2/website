Subject: RE: [VB] Compression ratios on SP engine

I have .195 shims on my 1800. If there is a problem with to wide of an
engine I do sell single port intake manifolds that you can cut the ends off
a center section to use or use a duel port center section.

Ric,

For comparison, I just did this on my motor.  I agree that  too much and the
engine gets a bit wide, especially for a stock manifold.

With my numbers I had to shim .060 under all cylinders to get a 7.0 c/r.  I
totally neglected to factor in the fit of the stock intake, and when I just
read your post I ran out to see if the stock exhaust would fit.  It fit with
no problems.

In short, the intake is a very tight fit.  I might have to bend it outward a
bit while installing...might just use a wench and strap to widen it up a bit
too.  Still, as it sits, I can make it fit and the ends sit like they should
in the head castings.  I did end up grinding that small tab off of the head
inboard of the intake hole.  The ends of the manifold were hitting on it as
I
tried to install the manifold.  I think I'll need a wee bit of tin trimming
around the intake ends as well.  I think .060 on each side is a max....at
least for the single port single carb set up.  Dual carbs are not a
problem...obviously.

I think some of the shimming issues can be avoided by using dished pistons
(I'll try this next time) and semi hemi cutting the head.  I'd feel better
having this done (Berg) than me hacking away Willie nilly (you might be more
skilled) free hand at my newly rebuilt heads.  Just my opinion.

Anyone have some single port Kadron manifolds laying around??

Steve

&gt; I re-measured the deck heights tonight. I also lined up the stock muffler
&gt; and SP intake. I can not shim more than .020&quot; on each side and feel
&gt; comfortable with the fit.
&gt;
&gt; This what I have: ( Numbers approximate)
&gt;
&gt; No shims:  8:1
&gt; with shims 0.020   = 7.6:1
&gt; no shims and carve 4.75 cc from the head chamber = 7.5:1
&gt; .010 shims and carve 3.25 from the chamber = 7.5:1
&gt; no shims carve 9cc from the chamber = 7:1
&gt; .020 shims and carve 6.25cc from the head  = 7:1
&gt;
&gt; Can anyone give me a short course on where and how to hand remove material
&gt; from the head?I would like to hit on a happy medium.
