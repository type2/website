Wow, I would have jumped on the originals for that price.  I have a friend that has been trying everything to get a set of originals from me.  I do have a set of reproductions that I am selling that have never been installed.  I am missing the dash tabs and there is a crack in the glass on one side, but they are a heck of a lot less than $400.  I just had glass cut for a friend's original safaris.  They look great.  For less than $100 the glass guy took them apart (leaving all of the screw threads intact!), cut the glass, and installed the glass.  That, of course, was the easy part.  Finding the frames and getting them back into useable condition was the hard part.

Good luck in your hunt.

I saw 2 sets at the last Marin CA show.  The first was a complete Wolfgang set

for $400! (They're only $389 direct from Wolfgang.)  Another fella had originals,

just the frames in rough shape, with no (or broken) glass, for $300.  I passed

on both and will also be going with Izzs for my 67 deluxe.
