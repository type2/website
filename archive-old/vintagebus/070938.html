Subject: Re: [VB] PLF highroof accident

Holy Crap!  What the heck happened?  And what exactly is the &quot;other&quot; bus
they mentioned?  Hope everybody is alright.

&gt; Just saw the photos of Dawns accident and the PLF highroof. Hope everyone
is
&gt; ok! It is a shame to see such a nice bus in that state. Lisa and I were
just
&gt; admiring it on Saturday. Anyone know what happened?
&gt;
&gt; Drive safe!!
