&lt;&lt; recess.  My 60 DC had the flat doors.  What is correct
 for the 61?  I seam to remember that the recessed
 version was a one or two year things and that the
 handle was different in some way.  Can anyone help and
 remind me what is what.

for the pull handles on the cab doors....

If your bus has high hinge cargo doors, the bus had the flat front doors.

if low hinge doors (just above the beltline) it has the indents for the front 
handles

nice that they changed both at the same time.  It was in Nov 60, so during eh 
61 model year.
