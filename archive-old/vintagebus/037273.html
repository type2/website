Subject: heat shrink hose clamps
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I like the clean look of the original crimp type VW hose clamps, but can't 
find them anywhere.  Anybody try these heat shrink clamps?  Looks like they 
would be pretty, and after all that's what counts on a VW engine.

Says they are for (water) cooling lines.  This might be a problem.

Almost too embarrassed to sign this, Tom Good in Vermont
