PROJECT 57:


ATTACK PLAN:

As soon as the deluxe arrives it will be stripped. Stripped completely.  
Doors, decklid, everything.  Will &quot;hopefully&quot; have either Matt Howard or Dave 
Shwinehagen do the replacement of the side rocker.  Prep and ready for paint. 
 Take seats to be bead blasted and powder coated and then to Doug for the 
final touches and covers. 

NEEDED SUPPLIES:

Deluxe rear bumper trim
Rear bumper splash pans
NOS Fluted headlight lenses and buckets
Passenger floor mat
36 Horse tin and Generator and anything else 36 for early 57 (Hey Everett!)
Respectable split case rebuilder in Arizona

Will pay reasonable price for any of the above.
