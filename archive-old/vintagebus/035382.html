 Hey all,
 I'm going to be picking up some middle seats soon, and I don't want them
 to get beat around in the back of the truck...or up on the roof rack...
 so I decided I'd take the bus and clamp them down as they were intended
 to be.  Thing is...there are 2 seats.. and I only want to make one
 trip.  If I take out the rear seat, can I put in a middle seat in its
 place?  Will it fit ok?
 This is in a 62 bus...and the seats are all splitty seats..
  &gt;&gt;
never tried it.   go ahead.   you can also face a middle seat backwards and 
lean it against the metal divider.  sure you can put two in there.   donno it 
you can clamp the rear one down
