Thanks to those who replyed to my last post. I learned a bunch about these
Porsche wheels. I followed a few leads, but not quite what I was looking
for.  I found another set for sale, however.  They have been bead blasted.
My question is: Since they are now totally stripped, how do I polish them to
a bright shiny luster? Can I do it with my die grinder and polishing wheel?
Also, What exactly is involved in narrowing a front beam? These wheels are a
little wide...(15x6), will narrowing my beam help me out?  Thanks. Also if
anyone wants to get rid of some drop spindles or straight axle kit, please
let me know. Its...uh...for a friend. :)
