I think the posts for 12V should point up and slightly to the right when 
looking at the motor from the rear of the car.
there also should be an Access slot on the top for when it comes time to 
replace the brushes.

&lt;&lt;In the midst of replacing the generator on my 1600DP doghouse-cooled motor
I neglected to notice the placement of the generator on its stand.  I
remember somewhere that the gen has to be placed in a certain place to get
cooling.  Anyone help me on this?

Thanks, Don
