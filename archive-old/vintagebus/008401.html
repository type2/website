Can someone forward this to the vanaagon list

Bustober Fest 2000, Indian Cave State Park SE Nebraska


Bustober Fest 2000,
Indian Cave State Park,
SE Nebraska.
October 27, 28, 29

This campout was designed to bring together VW lovers from the 4 state
area of Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska and Kansas.

The campground is located on beautiful tree covered bluffs beside the Big
Muddy, otherwise known and the Missouri River.  The leaves should be in
full color for the campout.  Louis and Clark are known to have visited the
site and camped.  We are planning some activities, there are very nice
hiking trails in the park, a number of interesting sites in the park can be
reached by road.  There is a small river town within short driving distance
that may lend itself to a nice cruise.  Of course the usual camping fun and
games along with premier VW story telling will be on the venue.

There will be a number of hard core bus owners present including No Quarter
and Rob from Nebraska who are regulars on the list along with people from
the other 3 states whose names you are sure to recognize.

This will be a really great way to meet others who share the interest in VW
busses.  Everyone is welcome to camp with us, no matter what you drive.
Our physiology is, if we can show people how fun it is to drive and camp in
a VW bus, we may be able to sign up a few new bus owners!
