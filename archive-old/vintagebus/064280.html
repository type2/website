Subject: Friday

Since it's friday I have 2 &quot;non-bus &quot; question although it is VW related!
1 Is there a bug list as good as this bus list ??
2 I bought a 74 Super Beetle for my 16 for her first car. She is handling
the stick OK but the hesitation is terrible!!!! I can hardly drive it. My
local VW guy (Who has done great work on my 66 split window)  says I will
probably need a new intake and maybe a vacuum advance dist.
I am not a mechanic by any means. Any suggestions about curing this
hesiation? I hope this is the correct term?!?! Any order of repair? Both at
the same time?
Thanks
Tom
