I think you may be referring to my site, and it is here:

http://home.cwru_dot_edu/~agw4/docs.htm

Up to main group 5 is online, and I just finished scanning section 6
tonight.  The real kudos for the parts manual should go to Steven Howell,
who has made excellent xerox copies available very reasonably priced.  I'm
just scanning, although I am putting up a lot more than the parts manual.  A
Without Guesswork manual that runs up through 1969 is online, I'll be adding
a 71-73 one after the parts manual, and then a T1-T3 to '73 parts manual.
I'm always scouring eBay and the swaps for new out-of-print manuals...

&gt; A few issues ago someone posted the URL where they scanned the parts
manual.
&gt; It was a wonderful site and obviously took a lot of work.  I thought I
&gt; bookmarked it, but can't seem to find it.  Can you post it again?
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Mike in NC
