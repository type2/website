Subject: RE: [VB] re:rhino liner

Something to keep in mind here is what it is VERY VERY difficult to
remove this stuff once it's been applied. Ten years from now, somebody
(you or a new owner) will be cussing long and loud about the jackass
that sprayed that stuff on there...

Thats sounds great!  Let me know if it works.  I have the interior out
of my 
sundial now (CAN YOU SAY LOUD) and was thinking about doing that too.
The 
original felt doesn't work that well and dynomat i$ expensive.  Have
brought 
this up on the list before and heard lots fo suggestions, like tar paper
and 
such.
