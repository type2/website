In the span of three days, really two and a half, I managed to pull the
engine in the bus and do A LOT of work.  This is the fifth time I have
ever pulled a VW engine and I can say that it seems to be easier each
time.  I learned a lot about the old bus this time especially what was
going wrong with the generator.  For all of those people that are having
problems with there generator light flickering in the odometer, I have
another possibility as to why this is happening.  After successfully
pulling the generator and the fan from the shrouding, I noticed that the
shaft was continuing to spin.  I tried to loosen the 36mm bolt on the
fan while holding the &quot;jam&quot; screw driver in the pulley but it continued
to spin.  I was confused and kept checking the direction to make sure I
was doing it right.  It turns out the woodruff key was sheared off in
the pulley.  This caused the &quot;flickers&quot; with the red light, the engine
to run hotter because the belt was slipping, and the battery to
basically die.  I guess there was enough metal in-between the generator
shaft and the pulley to jam it so it would not freely spin all the
time.  I could tell from the wear that it was spinning every once in a
while, hence the &quot;flickers&quot;.  That is a point the Muir never talks about
but is so simple to check.  Never the less, I replaced the generator
with a new Bosch and polarized it.  I also replaced the fuel sending
unit and repired/repainted the gas tank.  So far, the 6 volt tank gauge
works with the 12 volt system.  It is always nice to know how much gas
you do have in your tank but there is a since of adventure when the
gauge does not work.  I did other stuff but I just wanted to list what
struck me as funny and what other people could use for the next time
they have the same problems as I did.
