Subject: Solex Carbs H-32/34PDSI-3 Electric Choke

Please don't be offended that I'm sending a bulk reply.
I scavenged parts from a 34 PICT-3 Kit, Cut four of my own gasket and
they work.
How long?
Many list members and no vendors have been of assistance.
Closest thing I got to a straight answer was from a fellow that says they
fit an Opal, if he has the kits they'll be all dried out .............
still want them?
Thanks to all for your efforts.

Stan Wilder
