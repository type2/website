ok, list, this is my first post!!  i've been reading your stuff for a couple
months now and can see that there is a wealth of information in you all (along
with an opinion or two, which i think is good).  this first question of mine
is the result of an incident that happened to me and my 61 crewcab yesterday:

when i stepped on the brake pedal after seeing a couple cars ahead of me
slowing down for pedestrians in a crosswalk, the pedal was HARDER than usual
and i didn't slow down (almost time to panic).  i pushed a bit harder and my
left front wheel locked up pulling me to the left.  thun the wheel like crazy
to the right to compensate then all of a sudden the right front brake locks up
and whips me to the right extreemely hard, all the way into the next lane!  by
the time i turned the wheel to straighten out i was sliding through the
crosswalk, past the two cars i originally saw slowiing down.  fortunately i
hit no other vehicle and the folks in the crosswalk stopped and had a good
laugh.  i was kind of busy with the steering wheel and looking to see who i
was going to hit and never really noticed if the rear brakes locked  or not.

after pulling over and calming down for a few minutes, i drove around a
parking lot testing my brakes.  there was a slight pull to the left but seemed
so-so.  i made it home (slowly!) and pulled everything apart,  could find no
visible problems, cleaned and re-assembled everything.  blead the rears -
noting unusual.  Blead the front right - nothing unusual.  Blead the front
left and felt more resistance than the first 3 wheels.  pushed harder and it
all of a sudden let go and seemed to bleed normal.  i checked and found no
'chunks' of anything swimming in the spent brake fluid.

i drove the pickup around a bit yesterday after checking things out, and drove
it all around today from west phoenix to scottsdale to tempe and it doesn't
pull a bit to either side now.

can anyone offer an explanation as to what happened and why it isn't happening
now?

thanks in advance for any input,
