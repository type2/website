Subject: Testing the Terminals

One more time . . testing the terminal . .

I just did that post on greasing the terminals 
but forgot about this part . . 

the part where you get to make your own tests and make 
up your own mind . . 

We know that a volt is amount of current that will pass
a resistance of 1 ohm . . or some such blather . . :-)

And then we have the bit about an increase in resistance 
is a drop in voltage . . 

So it's pretty plain we want to see less than 1 ohm
of resistance between the terminal and it's mate . .

I think I have a post on using the dwell meter which is 
also a volt meter and gives details of testing a connector
under load . . another way to test . .

So grease 'em or wax 'em or paint 'em and then check with 
your vom or dwell meter for how good your connection really
is . .

 Oh yes . . suppose you have 1 ohm between the terminal and the 
wire/cable . . on each end and then you have another ohm where each
of those terminals connects . . you now have 4 ohms . . bad . .
