   Dan,
      If this fellow worries about you being picky, maybe his work is not up
to par?  I deal with some of the worse people in the world when it comes to
being picky.  Most of their cars have a price tag bigger than my house and if
I was standing by their car on a public street, well lets just say the fuzz
would have a pretty good response time.  Yet these unknowing people bring me
there Benzs and such for me to bang out there bo-bo's before the country club
set finds out that Kiki had one to many and backed over a golf cart.  Being
picky just shows how much you love your bus and as a body man and a Volkswagen
owner I can understand your love.  It's a genuine love, not like Kiki's and
her Benz.  It that love, that vision, of someday driving downtown and watching
the reflection of your bus in the store windows as you go by.  You just get
this funny little smile and go Wow.  Chances are you would get a better job
and a better deal if you can find a VW type body man (or woman for that
matter).  Flag down some of the nicer VW's you see in your area and ask some
questions...who knows?
  BTW buying a Thing took up most of yesterday will dig up the rack this
afternoon.
    Peace, Love, and bodywork to some is just a job--to me it's art!!
          Mr. Bubble Head
