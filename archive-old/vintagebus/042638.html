&gt; Yes. Might be a good idea to put the later model disc brakes (72 and on) on
&gt; there when you find some in a bone yard. One year parts are more expensive

&gt; braking power.
actually,

71-72 brakes are the same.  73-79 are identical, and one can use 80-85
front rotors (identical) and 80-85 front calipers (require different hard
line from caliper to soft line.)

&gt;  &gt;does anyone
&gt; &gt;know if the 71-72 bus 5 lug is the same pattern as porsche wheels.
&gt; 
&gt; No...it's different.
but the bus hubs/rotors can be drilled to the porsche pattern by a good
machine shop...


peas,

Steve
