Subject: Timing/Idle mixture

Hello list,
I recently changed over to a vacuum dizzy on my 67 Sundial with a stock
1600SP.

Set my timing statically at 0 degrees TDC, as per everything I read.  Engine
idled roughly.  I tried it at 7.5 degrees BTDC, (which I had to guess at
since my pulley only has one mark on it).  Seemed to run smoother then.  My
dizzy is a 205T.

Then I tried setting the idle mixture on my carb.  This seems to be a
guessing game, with no way that I can figure out to tell if it has been done
right.  Turned the volume screw out 2 1/2 turns, turned it in until it
slowed, out until it reached it's fastest speed, and then re-adjusted my
idle.

I find that my engine idles smoothly, quietly and I've lost the hesitation
that I experienced with my 009.  However, I seem to be lacking mid-range
power.  Also, I get the smell of the engine when I come to a stop.  The
engine seems to be running hot, although again, thats based on my senses,
not on any measurment.

I'm concerned about the timing recommendation of 0 degrees TDC and my engine
running crappy when I set it at 0 degrees.  I'm concerned that I am slowly
burning up my engine.  It doesn't ping, smoke or anything like that.

Any recommendations?

TIA, Ed
