&gt; List,
&gt;
&gt; I just moved to California and would like to invite my brother, who
&gt; surpasses me as a VW nut, to a VW show in California.  What are your
&gt; recommendations?  He'll only get to come once probably, and he's a fan of
&gt; all vintage and race VW's.  What show would be the best to fly him in for?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,

Make it out for the VW Classic weekend. 6/5 - 6/9 if possible come a week
early and go to Pomona on 6/2 as well.
