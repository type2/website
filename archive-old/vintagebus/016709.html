&gt;Great, my problem 
&gt; is, I have
&gt; an older engine of unknown size ( should be a 1600 
&gt; but.....),mileage, fan
&gt; size, stock doghouse cooler, yada, yada, yada.
&gt; In other words, an unknown quanity.

Jon:
Because your engine is so nebulous, you might want to take a sample of
oil in for analysis. Also run a compression check (maybe park around the
block and put road flares around the bus to make it look like a
breakdown, that way your building super can't kick you out for working on
it) Keep a close eye on your oil level; if it goes up you may be leaking
gas into the crank case. Gas will not make your oil run any cooler.  If
you are not leaking oil (rare) and notice the level going down your
engine is burning oil. You will need a oil with a high flash point and
burn off. The higher the viscosity the higher the FP and burn off. The
less oil you burn the more it cools yer motor. paraffinic oils have a
higher FP than Naphtha base oils. 
If you run a high viscus oil, say straight 40wt., your  oil cooler seals
are likely to blow out so warm that puppy up before you pull out of your
apartment stall. no early revving.

the dogs have stopped barking so I'm off to bed again.
