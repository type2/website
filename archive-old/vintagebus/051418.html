And I sold that repro set to another listee.

It's all a big circle.

&gt; He has also told me that if there was enough interest he would make more
&gt; hoops, the last time he made them everyone complained of the price, he can
&gt; still gear up to make them and I will contact him if there is enough
&gt; interest. The last set he had went to Joe Bair in Jersey for the side
loader
&gt; I sold him, and the other 3 sets went to Everett, Jerry Jess and me. I
sold
&gt; mine when I found a set of OG and you would have been hard pressed to tell
&gt; his from OG
