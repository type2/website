This is very definitely ILLEGAL!  What are you running, a chop shop?

Our friend's title issues should be very easy to solve,  based on my
knowledge of CALIFORNIA law (not Florida)

Here's what he needs to do:

* Call DMV and find out first and foremost the status on the title: ie is
the dang thing even on the books, is it stolen, and liens or parking
tickets against it, etc.

Possible outcomes:

a) bus is stolen: get Johnny Law involved, but don't sink another dime into
the damn car at this point

b) bus is not on the books; there will be a procedure to get the bus back
on the books in your name - follow it.

c) bus is titled in the name of the bozo who sold it to you (assuming it's
clear)

d) bus is titled under someone elses name (assuming it's clear)

Now, if the bus is in Bozo's name, then what's the holdup in getting it
transfered?  You got a bill of sale, right?  You should be able to transfer
it without a pink slip - we can here

If it's in Some Other Guy's name, what you have to do is re-create (ie
document) the chain of ownership back for n owners up to the bill of sale
that you have in your hot, greasy little hands.  I had to do this for the
'56, as it had been passed from hand to hand several times like a drunken
sorority girl.  Your DMV will have the instructions on how to do this.

Yes, you will have to spend some time on hold and waiting in lines.  Big
deal.  It's part of the process of restoring a bus, like scraping years of
grime off of a transmission case, but just not as fun.

Oh, and ALWAYS GET A BILL OF SALE, EVEN IF THEY DON'T HAVE THE PINK SLIP
FOR THE CAR!  Even if you have to write one on a napkin!
