Reuse the metal rods from the original seat covers. You might have to
make a little cut at one end of the seam to slide them in. Use the wires
like Thom mentioned for the places where there isn't a rod. TMI seat
covers come with a string that looks like it might last a few years
where the original covers had a wire.

&gt; I'm in the process of recovering the bare seat frames in my '67.  I've put
&gt; the old twiggy seat pads back on and added some cotton sheets on top to
&gt; strengthen and cushion them.  I received the stock mesh platinum seat cover
&gt; set from Wolfsburg West and am starting to put them on.
&gt; Now, my question.  When putting these coveres on, they don't fit &quot;tight.&quot;
&gt; I've noticed there are little hooks on the under side of the seat frame.
&gt; The thing is, on the old upholstery, these hooks were used to wrap around a
&gt; metal rod that was sewn into the stock seat covers.  The seat covers I have
&gt; don't have this rod in them.  How can I get these things to stay on tight?
&gt; Anyone have any experience with this?
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; -Wes
