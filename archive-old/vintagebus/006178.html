Actually Eberspacher (sp) would be the best choice as these were installed
in VW's. Was that a dealer option? I have one laying around just waiting for
me to go through it to make sure it would work. I it was me for this price
you can get an original gas heater that installs in the engine compartment.
Just my two cents;
PS. Smokestack? that would be something to see.
