Subject: Heater cable, transmission questions

Well my shop manual should arrive tomorrow (along with my right side
heat exchanger) which should put to an end some of my more inane
questions.  However, tonight I'm changing exhaust and the left side
exchanger along with the heater cable.  I was curious if anyone could
tell me the easiest way to change out the heater cable?

Also I changed fluid in my transmission last week (thanks Matt for the
directions) and now I have a leak coming from around my boots, I was
going to check the level anyway and maybe change the fluid again to see
if any more metal would come out of the old girl (and it may just be to
full) but I was curious if anyone has stopped any leaks around that area
and short of tearing it all apart what is the best way?

I intend to travel to NM in two days and need my heater and piece of
mind.  If you know the answers please respond tonight, currently I'm
just letting the liquid wrench penetrate the exhaust bolts so I have
some down time (my garage being cold may have something to do with the
amount of time I'm spending in the house as well.)

Thanks all
