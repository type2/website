Subject: Re: [VB] Another rim question.

&gt;Did you ever wonder why.....
&gt;
&gt;on a vehicle which is 99.9% metric, the rims are 14 or 15 inch?
&gt;
&gt;American Imperialism?

&gt;Imperial Americanism?



Combination of American and English domination of the tire market in the
early days of the automibile, I'd guess.

I have seen some metric wheels and tires.  Remember the Michelin TRX?  It
came as factory equiptment of some Ford autos in the late 70s - early 80s.
Goodyear was working on a similar tire called the 'Elliptical Radial'
(typical American sloganism), but never brought it to market.  These tires
were low profile (about a 65% aspect ratio), and the bead sealing area had
a different shape than convential tires.  The metric rim diameter was
partly to prevent mounting of conventional tires on TRX wheels.

There was more than one wheel diameter, but I recall that one of them was
380mm.
