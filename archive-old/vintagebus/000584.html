&lt;&lt; Hey gang,
 
 There is a 1957 Kombi around my area that I have had my eye on for quite a
 while waiting for the guy to sell.  Well that day is here.  I was driving
 by it today and almost broke my neck taking a double-take after I saw the
 for sale sign.  It is in extremely good shape!  This is a no rust beauty
 with less than 100,000 miles!  It is missing the middle seat, and it has
 after market tail lights cut in, but they are really cool looking, but not
 original :(.  It also has over-rider bumbers, but it has both of them and
 they're in good shape.  The paint is ok, with a little
 oxidation.  It runs good, and as far as I know everything is mechanically
 sound.  All the interior panels and chrome handles are there, but it's
 missing a headliner.  Both the front and rear rubber mats are in good
 shape, and the seat covers are in pretty good shape.   Anyway, I want
 to know if anyone has any suggestions of what this thing would be worth.

well, how much doi they want and how much can you feel okay with paying.  
remember, the missing taillights (reflectors too i suppose) and stamped 
bumpers would probably set you back maybe $700 w/o stetching, when you find 
them, if you want them.  kombis didn't come with headliners, but standard 
micros did, which model is it?    have you checked the VIN to make sure it's 
a 57?  in any case a nice rust free (did you check scrupulously?)splitty that 
runs great is lovely.  with that low miles, still things need mechanical help 
and replacement from age rot, do a thouough check and factor that in when you 
think about price.
