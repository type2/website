Subject: Re: [VB] Jerome report / dropgate pieces / Busware canopys

I knew I would hate checking my email this week!
Unfortunately I missed it this year, 12+ hours one way
is a little long to do solo for me. I guess no one
from up here went or at least wasn't caravaning that I
heard about.  
 Sounds a little like the 2001 show as far as the
people go. There are people like that where ever you
go. Sometimes I wish VW had made a garbage truck!
