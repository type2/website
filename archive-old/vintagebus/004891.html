&gt;&lt;&lt; H Y P O C R I T E.....isnt this the exact same thing as lowering a bus?
If
&gt; you arent happy with your bus at standard height and you lower it, that
hurts
&gt; the bus's feelings.  Dont you feel guilty for not liking your bus as VW
&gt; intended it to be?  If someone transplants a roof, there's a very good
chance
&gt; a bus came from the factory that way.  We've all seen a factory sunroof
&gt; Kombi's, but there's never been a lowered bus from the factory.
&gt;  &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;im a little confused on the HYPOCRITE comment.whos really being the
hypocrite,
&gt;the ones who think lowering is good and cutting is bad, or the ones who
think
&gt;cutting is fine and lowering is bad?or is this just a case of defending
people
&gt;you like and mocking people you dont like?

I don't think he said whether they liked cutting or not, or lowering either
for that matter. Just that one was available from the factory and one
wasn't. In fact, I think he likes Jetta's or something like that. As long as
you like your bus, who the hell cares? I don't like buses that are lowered
by yanking springs because they are a serious hazard to everyone on the
road. Lowered correctly I don't care. I wouldn't want one, can't haul much,
high center all the time, but your happiness shouldn't hinge on whether I
want your bus or not, anyway. The Westfailure has many of the same problems
of a lowered bus. It's nearly 20 feet long and has a big old pro stock scoop
under it to suck air into the V8 engine. Have  to plan carefully when
entering or exiting parking lots. OTOH it'll probably do 130 m.p.h.
reasonably safely and it'll tow a bus at 80, should that be necessary. 8^0
There is nothing more 'precious' than some little pseudo-vintage Nazi
walking by it flapping his gums about how good he is being for not coming
over and bitching me out about it. The poor dear, better pack a lunch before
he makes any plans like that. If we all liked the same things you'd all want
one, and it's not for sale. Think how sad that would be for you. If you want
a lowered sunroof panel and the neighbor kid wants to trade straight across
for your vintage Nazi Kombi, great. If not, get the Sawzall out. The next
owner of your bus has no rights over it while you own it. They can say
whatever they want after the check clears, even refer to you as DPO. Long as
we all like our buses, and buy enough parts to keep the manufacturers
interested, that's a good thing.
