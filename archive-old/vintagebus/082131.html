Although my wife doesn't readily crawl under the bus, I am happy to report
that she came equipped with not one, but two aircooled VWs (one of which
we still have 15 years later).  After our first child was born she spoke
the immortal words &quot;I don't want a minivan, I want a VW bus!&quot; which led to
our long term affair with our fine German touring machine.
