Subject: Empty trailer
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

It looks like I'll be at Red Barn/Kelly Park with an empty trailer.  If 
anybody on the list needs something transported south to LA after the show or 
maybe east a little ways, look for me.  I probably won't be in the '55 Ch_at_vy 
and trailer combination there (at least I hope I'll be in a VW), but leave a 
message at the two tone blue single cab (Rachel's) or the red and white 
flipseat Westy (Jon Furst's).

PS I'll leave my cell phone on during the shows:  505-263-4600
