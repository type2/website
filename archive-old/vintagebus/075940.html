Subject: Re: [VB] Towing my 67

replace parts and fill with oil.   lack of lubrication wears the parts, and 
causes damage, shortening its useful life.

all, of the oil for the box leaked out. Now, if I am towing the bus,
front wheels up, rear down, for about 8 miles, max speed about 50
mph, should I worry about refilling the box to ensure nothing seizes?
Or is it safe to tow this short distance and speed. Engine is out.
    Thanks for the help.
