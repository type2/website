Subject: 009, broken PICT 34, and an extractor!
Date: Thu, 22 Mar 2001 07:40:43 -0500

Importance: Normal



The bus I just bought and had shipped here runs like poop.
The PICT 34 Carb has a broken acclerator pump adjustor, the notched arc on
the body is warped and diconnected, the nut to hold her on, gone. The bus
will start and idle, but dies when you try to accelerate (most of the time),
as expected.
So, on this 1600 DP&lt; I am in for a carb, and wonder, since I hear of PICT
34/009 issues, plus icing caused by a bugpack extractor, I pose the
question, what's the most economical and dependable replacement here? Do I
go SVDA and a new PICT 34? Try to jet a Pict 30 and stay with the 009? Do I
get rid of this exhuast?
