neither does any car company when they build thier engines.  

that would be like buying a new honda, and tearing the motor down to
make sure its &quot;ok&quot;.  sure it aint going to be blueprinted and balanced,
but you trust that motor dont you?  why not this one?

&gt; Hi Pete,
&gt; Well you do not have to take it apart, but if you want to trust and get the
&gt; best HP, longevity, and MPG then taking it apart is a good idea.  After all
&gt; the volks in Mexico are not going to balance the pistons, and connecting rods
&gt; down to the point that there is no differance.  Plus they are not going to
&gt; polish and blue print the heads, and oil system.  So while it would probably
&gt; run, if you are looking for as close to perfection as possible you are the
&gt; only one who can make sure of that.
