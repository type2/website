Short:
I went to the Pomona swap meet.  The End.  ;p

Long:
Friday night I loaded up the '55 Kombi with all
my parts-for-sale and parts-to-be-delivered-at-
the-show, including, but not limited to, a
1959-60 Deluxe middle seat (trade to Havasu Ronnie
for a '63 Deluxe middle seat), a 1956 Kombi middle
seat (sale to listee Greg Noble), a NOS 36hp head,
NOS Barndoor horn button, and my just-got-it-Friday
1957 mint green middle seat (to sell).  Got all the
seats in, along with a bunch of plastic cases of
&quot;maybe I can make a few extra bucks&quot; parts. Checked
my log and noticed I hadn't changed the oil in 2,000
miles.  That included my high-temperature 55 mph
desert drive to the Classic so I set the oil a'
draining while I gathered my personal items.

Saturday I headed out at 4 am with a small stop to
drop off a Double Cab tilt at a friends house.  Since
Phoenix is crime-free (ha!), I just left it sitting on
his porch.  Apparently his neighbors think his Double
Cab is a POS and avoid it.  How weird, I think it's
pretty nice.

The trip was uneventful, it's nice to drive
through the desert in the early am, the max. temperature
was only 95, still cool enough for vent wing air-
conditioning.  9 short hours later, I arrived at listee
Greg Noble's house for a personal viewing of his late '55
Westfalia and a new Kombi he recently purchased.  We
unloaded his new middle seat, screwed around for a while,
then cruised to the store in his RHD '59 Beetle for some
BBQ supplies.  After a meal and some moving of parts,
Greg started digging through all his parts for the Pomona
swap.  We loaded up and took off to stay overnight at
Pomona.  I took delivery of a 6-leg middle seat there,
which I &quot;forced&quot; Greg sleep on to &quot;protect&quot; it.  Sleep was
a problem though so we ended up setting out all our parts
at about 3am.

Sunday, we swapped.  I put a sign on Greg's 1947 Beetle
engine he had recently acquired - &quot;'47 Bug engine, found
in desert today, make offer&quot;.  It turned out to be an
interesting experiment as at least 1/3 of the people that
looked at it said &quot;Wow, what desert?&quot;  Heh.

I met a bunch of visitors to my site at Pomona, which is
always cool.  No one really bought much at Pomona (from me
at least), kinda disappointing but at noon I took the'
obligatory walk around the swaps as most of the people
were packing up and I picked up a single tip exhaust and
some misc. NOS parts, all for under $50.

The 8 hour drive home was tough as I had only had 4 hours
of sleep in 2 1/2 days but I made it with no problems.  I
stopped at the rest stop atop Chirico Summit to rearrange
some of my cargo and my oil light was flickering at idle.
I was running a bit hot after doing 55-60 (tailwind and me
not paying attention) followed by the 25-mile grade of the
summit.  After a minute of letting my Bus idle, it cooled
down and I continued on my way.  About 10 miles outside of
Phoenix, I was stopped by the police.  &quot;I couldn't see your
taillights and you were doing 50-55 in a 75 mph zone.&quot;  After
some chatting about the max. speed of my Bus and a discussion
about 5W tallights, I got off with a warning.

Everett Barnes
