You can't *request* one of those #'s - DMV won't let you get a *personalized*
plate that is in sequence with a notnal serial run, - but they're *assigning* 
them. I saw one that was really close to my mom's 73 super's plate.

&gt; Actually, I believe that you can't register a boutique plate with certain
&gt; number patterns such as &quot;AAA 111&quot;, &quot;1AAA111&quot;. I wanted to register
&gt; &quot;1TYP266&quot; for my 66 which would look like a regular numbered plate, but
&gt; have significance to bus geeks. But according to DMV I can't do it.
