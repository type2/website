Hey Ellis,

My 66 doesn't squeal.  the brakes vibrate when hammered down the pedal, I 
believe my drums need turned!  I do have the dual circuit MC conversion.  
Let's see what everyone else says.  Oh yeah my boss said that if you over 
torque your lugs it can affect the properties of the drum. Just something to 
think about.

Eric
