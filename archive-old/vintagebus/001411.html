Subject: Bigger Brake Problems

I still have not figured out my brake peddle assembly but went ahead and
tried to bleed the brakes and managed to break the bleeder screw off of
the front passenger side.  Needless to say my stress meter just pegged.
As if that isn't enough, the skies just opened up and put a stop on
getting this done anytime some.  So what does one do when the bleeder
screw breaks off.  Tap it out?  Get it towed to someone who knows what
they are doing?  I'm pretty much screwed getting to work tomorrow unless
I can find a ride from a co-worker.  This is not the fun filled weekend
I had planned for.
