Subject: cutting safety glass

Both sides of the glass have to be cut....a template is a &quot;must&quot; for this.
After cutting both sides....you make the break as you would for any other
glass.
I like to score a line perpendicular to each outside edge as well and make
the break in two pieces.
After the break is finished, I squirt lighter fluid onto the glass all
around the cut lines.
Next, light the fluid...let it burn and while it is burning, pull on the
separated glass pieces.  The heat/fire will expedite the separation of the
plastic laminate.  
A bit of clean up and you are done.
The rough edges can and should be done at an automotive glass repair
facility...unless someone can offer a time tested solution to this...I'm
all ears.
later
