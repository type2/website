I am looking to buy a transaxle, however, it's not as easy as going to the
local
rebuilder because I live in Wenatchee, WA.  I have looked at a few companies
and wanted to ask those on the list if they have had any experience with
them.
I don't plan on exchanging my current one but would rather pay the exchange
fee.

Kustom 1 Warehouse (warehouse or autohaus?)

Transform

Transform appears to carry mostly high performance trannys but high
quality stocks also.
