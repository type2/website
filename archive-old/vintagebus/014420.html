I have factory installed safris on my `60 westy...also
have factory installed radidio!...my antenna is very
close to the stock position on the left hand side of
the drivers windscreen...I bet they just drilled the
holes a tad to the left to mount the
antenna.....thought I must add my antenna does rub the
safari ever so slightly when I initially open the
safari...you can see on the original paint where this
has rubbed the one spot since new...some 40 years ago.

I installed factory safaris in my (recently sold!) `61
westy...had a stock radio and antenna...had to buy one
of those slightly modern rubber antennas like found on
the new beetles ect...it hits the safair but flexs
outta the way just enough to let it by.....not stock
but works well.

&gt; I do not have safari's but the antenna I put on my
&gt; 64 would work. It mounts on
&gt; the pass. side window pillar,
&gt; and has two mounting points.The antanna is offset
&gt; from the mounts by about an
&gt; inch.I really like this spot as it is out of the way
&gt; and does not detract from
&gt; the face! I just couldn't get myself to drill the
&gt; face!

&gt; &gt; I've seen two safari antenna solutions: one way is
&gt; an antenna with 2 90
&gt; &gt; degree bends, mounted on the side in the stock
&gt; location.  The other is the
&gt; &gt; twin-post antenna mounted over the emblem  in the
&gt; center.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I intend to put safaris on the '55 some day, so I
&gt; mounted a barndoor-style
&gt; &gt; antenna right at the base of the windshield frame.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;customer service and what everyone says it to be.
&gt;  But anyway, on a 67 bus
&gt; &gt; &gt;with safaris what kind of antanna was used and
&gt; where was it placed?  If I am
&gt; &gt; &gt;going out on a limb financially for the safaris
&gt; themselves i just have to
&gt; &gt; &gt;make sure that I have everything right!
