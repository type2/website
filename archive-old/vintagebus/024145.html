was writ:

&quot; ....* Turning 63-6400 RPM at 60 ...&quot;
then was writ again....thought it might have been a typo

&quot;.... * Transaxle geared too high. 6300 at 60 might be off, i *think i have a
64-66 tranny with 27 inch tires but it could be 67 gearing?? i am going to
put a small nut back in on principle I think....&quot;

might be off??? what on earth would make you think that? =)
