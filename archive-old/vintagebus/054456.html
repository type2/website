Torque wrench, a huge one. Mine is good to 500 lbs. 253 lbs isn't that
unthinkable for average guy, although it is barely reachable by me... :)
I wouldn't mind one of those Kymco torque multipliers though.

when you do this to break it free.... how do you tighten it back up?

&gt;I use a 46mm 1/2 socket from snap on with a 24 flex bar, and a 6 foot steel
&gt;pipe on it. Makes enough to break it free, and I used a jack on the bar end
&gt;in depseration once now, worked well.
