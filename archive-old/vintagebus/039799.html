hey,
i was watching my speed and rpm last night and this morning and heres what i 
cam up with. all are 4th gear:
40mph  3000rpm
50mph  3750
55mph  4000
60mph  4500
like i said before, i always try to stay righ around 62mph on road trips. 
but, that cruising rpm seems sooo high. should i get taller tires?
thanks,
