&gt; I sheared off the bleeder valve from a rear hub on a 71.  What is involved 
&gt; in
&gt; replacing this.

Hi Frank,
1.  Buy a copy of the Bentley VW Service Manual for your year and model VW!
2.  Block front wheels.
3.  Break loose lug and axle bolts on that side of rear tire.
4.  Jack up that tire via jack point or torsion tube.
5.  Unadjust that wheel brake shoes to allow the drum to slide off.
6.  Remove tire and drum, seperately or together depending on your wheel 
well.
7.  Take off upper brake spring.
8.  Use a screwdrive to pop the top of the brake shoes off the brake 
adjusting stars. 
8.  Unbolt the wheel/slave cylinder fro the brake line and then backing 
plate.
9.  Remove brake shoe hold-down spring seats, and springs.
10.  Push the upper part of the brake shoes together, so the bottoms remove 
themselfs from the wheel/slave cylinder, and you can remove the shoes.
11.  Remove the old wheel slave/cylinder.
12.  Grease or Never Sieze the male brake line threads and the bleeder valve 
to help these from rusting tight next time!
13. Bleed brakes and make sure that wheel/slave cylinder and all the pothers 
have the rubber cap over the bleeder valve to help prevent water entering them 
and rusting them shut!
