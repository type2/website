Do you have one of the repair manuals?

The front mount is a rubber-centered, sorta rectangualr thing.  The
transmission bolts to it, then it bolts to the body.  The rubber and
adhesive deteriorate over time, and it comes unglued.   When it does,
the weight of the engine on the transmission causes the front of the 
transmission to lift.  This puts strain on the coupler, and nose cone.
If left too long, it will crack the nose cone, bend the shift rod,
and possibly damage the shift selector.

To replace it, you will need to slide the transmission back about 3&quot;
or so.  Ideally, you should replace the coupler, front mount, and the
two rear mounts all at the same time.  You could also do the axle boots
while you're at it.  Yes, it's a solid afternoon of greasy work, but
you won't have to worry about this stuff for a while!
