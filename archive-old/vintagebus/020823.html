Subject: Re: [VB] Score! jealous

I tend to be a commerical guy myself, but there's something I like
about Brown/Brown and Green/Green standards.   If I was in college
I could just say I was experimenting...

&gt; &gt;Great deal, but one minor correction: that appears to be a Standard,
&gt; &gt;not a Kombi! (don't worry, that's a Good Thing)
&gt; 
&gt; How is that a good thing?
&gt; Kombis kick ass!
&gt; Check the registry....there's probably half (or less) the early kombis than
&gt; there are standards!
