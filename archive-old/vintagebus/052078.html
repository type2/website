Subject: Re: [VB] Engine teardown order and time allowance

I like the &quot;how to build your vw aircooled engine&quot; or whatever it's called 
from Wilson. It walks you through everything and worked very good for me.

Get lots of ziplocks and walmart bags and some big boxes and a sharpie. Put 
everything in bags and label them. Don't be afraid to use too many bags.

Take your time and expect to wait a while for parts to come in the mail. 
Especially stuff you loose or unexpectingly have to get or stuff you forgot 
to order the first time.

Make friends with a local VW shop or guru so you've got someone local to go 
to for small stuff. I used mine for removing the flywheel, and then again 
for installing it and setting the endplay (while I watched and learned). 
That gland nut is a major B*TCH! Makes it easier if you have a big bertha 
impact wrench. I don't.

Just do it and have fun. I get compliments from the local shops on how well 
my engine runs &quot;that's a great sounding little engine!&quot;. It was my first 
and I ran into a few problems along the way. But I did it cheap and it runs 
like a &quot;Singer&quot;.

Good luck.
