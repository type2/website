Subject: Non-charging battery

------=_NextPart_000_0042_01C16563.B4B960A0
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

So my battery doesn't wanna charge. I had it tested and they tell me the =
battery is good.  My ground is a little shakey so I'm replacing that.  =
The red light doesn't come on so that isn't an issue.  If it is a bad =
generator or a bad voltage regulator how do I figure out which, if =
either, is bad. I'm still hoping that it is the ground from the battery =
but that may not be the problem.  I don't have a meter of any sort but =
this may be the excuse I need to buy one.

TIA
