Subject: Re: [VB] question about nyloc nuts

Arguments can be made for either type of nut. The castle nut has gone the
way of the dodo in current tie rod ends (15 years ago the tie rods for my
Manx came with nylocs). One less machining process and one nut vs. nut w/
cotter pin for cost reasons. Nylocs are better in my opinion due to less
thread corrosion due to the nylon sealing the threads. Castle nuts hold
water and the threads rust. I am a diesel tech and have stripped out many a
tie rod castle nut removing it due to rusted threads. As far as torque with
a nyloc nut, if the torque wrench clicks it is torqued. It is a tapered fit
and once seated it is the same as torqueing a castle nut. Tapping it in is
the way to get it started. If you are worried about it backing off (which I
doubt very seriously) then use some Blue Loctite and then you won't have
worry about it.

I replaced all my tie rods on my Bus, Manx and Cabriolet (also ball joints)
and all came with nyloc nuts (all German parts to boot). Torqued them to
specs. and it is a done deal. I cruise around and have complete confidence
that none will come loose as I motor down the highway.
