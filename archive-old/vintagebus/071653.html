Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Dwell meter on 6v ??

&gt;Since we're on the topic I am having difficulty measuring the dwell on my
'57 - I don't seem to get a reading and the only thing I can think of is
that the system is 6v and the dwell meter is designed to trigger on 12v.
&gt;
My dwell meter doesn't read at all on 6v at idle but if I clamp the power
lead directly onto the generator D+ pole (reads 7-8v at idle), it works.

I'm not sure it's accurate though.
