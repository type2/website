&gt; &quot;remove the pin&quot; that's where I ran into problems.
[snip]
&gt; Does anyone have any pointers???  I do not recall seeing the pin OUT of
&gt; it's spot...  Is there a special way to push, twist or pull?

That there is a bugger, it is. I have tried to remove them from at least two
buses that were already cut up. Was only successful once, and that was by
bending up the bus itself. You can usually coerce them about half way then
they stop. The pin is usually dry and rusty, but at least there isn't any
way to get a punch on it square. Douse the hell out of it with Kroil or PB
Blaster and take slow careful aim and start whacking. Doesn't hurt to floss
it with emory cloth to get any high spots down before you try to drive it
through. Still, I'd bet you a dollar to a dog t*rd you're not going to get
it. 8^)

Might I ask why you want to remove it? It really isn't worth the stress.
