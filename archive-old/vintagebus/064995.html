Subject: Re: [VB] OT: Verizon Phone Service for Bus Traveling

well, I guess this is one of those &quot;perfect&quot; questions for me to answer.  My
Karma, er...busma would be screwed if I didn't.

I sell Verizon.  I use Verizon.  I didn't go with a seller's contract.  I went
with one like anybody on the list can get, because I didn't want to pick one
just because I sold it.  I wanted to go with the one that I thought was the
best to suit my needs.  

The current America's Choice starts at 300anytime, 4000N&amp;Wkds for $39.99 in the
SE states.  Verizon's America's Choice plan includes more square mileage than
ANY other provider can offer.  PERIOD.  NO ifs, buts, or what-ifs.  That fact
can't be disputed, and with the dissapearance of a few of the other providers
in the near future, no one will be able to &quot;catch-up&quot; to that for a long while.

Verizon also has the National Choice plan.  It's not often used, anymore, but
it still exists.  It starts at 125anytime for $35/month.  No nights, no
weekends, but if there's mobile service ANYWHERE you will be able to use it
without having to pay ANY roaming fees.  You can be on Hawaii Bob's cell phone
tower, where it's the only one on the island, and he normally gets $12 a minute
for someone else to use his tower, and you'll never see the difference in your
billing.  No roaming, period.

Both plans are nationwide, long distance, call ID, call waiting, conference
calling, etc...

Choice is yours.  Other reasons to like Verizon instead of Suncom: not as many
dropped calls while in moving car; you can talk to a human and it doesn't cost
you anything more, regarding billing, problems, or other rate plan
changes/questions; no rate plan change penalties

Check which plans and pricing are available in your area.  RadioShack isn't a
bad source.
