Where can we reach Mr. King for some of the floors. These look excellant!!! A 
few days back someone was asking about replacement metal, we usually keep 
quite on these matters, because we just hack up another bus to fix the one we 
are currently working on, due to the fact that almost all repro metal has 
stamping problems and there is nothing like original metal even if you have 
to take the time to drill out all the spot welds.
It is far to difficult to go into detail here on which repro panels are 
better than others but a sure thing is no one has good cargo floors repops or 
front floor repops.

So Congratulations to Mr. King!!!  I hope you have made several sets, we are 
interested in high quality reproductions, please contact us if you have 
more.If you haven't been watching his restoration, maybe you should drop in 
on his webpages.
