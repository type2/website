thats a load of bulls**t anyone who has ever driven a bus with
an adjustable beam knows that they ride like crap
if you lower them more than 2&quot; witch  is'nt enough
is the real reason that bus boys does'nt make dropped spindles
becouse every employee that knew haw left to start another shop????
even wolfgang spindles have new steering stops welded in place!!how
can you say that &quot;all the dropped spindles on the market are
much weaker than stock&quot;?????
how many have you ever seen break???none??
you guys should'nt preach what you don't know!!!-cameron

Charles:

If you lower the rear of your Bus at all with the reduction boxes
still in
place, camber will be effected. The swing axle conversion kit
is the most
popular way to drop the back end.

All of the dropped spindles we have seen on the market are MUCH
WEAKER than
stock spindles and are also missing the stops. That is why we
only sell the
adjustable beam. As long as you don't lower it all the way down
to the
snubbers, the ride is still pretty smooth.

Details can be seen here: http://www.bus-boys_dot_com/bbsusp.htm

&gt; I plan on lowering my bus that I have. I know of the lowering
kit that is
on
&gt; the market that does away with the reduction boxes, but can
you lower it
&gt; just like a bug by turning the splines, and leave the reduction
boxes? And
&gt; if so, how much can you lower it before the camber gets too
ridiculous?
Also I have heard rumor (don't know of anyone that's actually
done it), that
&gt; you can swap the spindles in the front from the left side to
the right,
and
&gt; vica/versa to get 4-5&quot; of drop without affecting the camber,
or bumpsteer.
