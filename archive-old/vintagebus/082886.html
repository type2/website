Subject: Re: [VB] Time switch for heater

&gt;Good to hear from Harry &amp; Rex, next thing you know, we 're gonna hear
from
&gt;Erin in Nebraska (No- ????-how could I forget his handle?) or Thom
&gt;
&gt;I've got one of those Bay heater switches-only about 8-10
connectors-whats
&gt;so complicated about it???
&gt;
&gt;Tom Buese-time to put the Eberspacher in-outside hose bib was frozen
&gt;yesterday am (26 degrees)

No Quarter....which I always thought was strange because that's a
nautical 
term...and there isn't much sea near Nebraska...

I heard he (like most of us) got really freaked out by 9/11 and
re-evaluated 
what he was doing.  The VW list was something he cut out - but I hear
he's 
pretty active on the buskatiers list.

Speaking of which - I haven't heard much of the kid from Vancouver that

was constantly posting - Kiran I think his name was...always signed off

with That Young VW Guy..

I almost miss those days of lots of e-mail from this list.  Now it's a
trickle.

Paul
