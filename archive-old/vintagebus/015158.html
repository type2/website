Bill, Tom,
         I didn't receive any bus digests yesterday (2/10) and didn't know 
if we were going to plan a hubcap exchange this weekend.  For those of you 
on the list, the hubcap is in Gainesville, Fl., will be transferred in St 
Augustine and taken back to Neptune Beach, Fl, and than on the Amelia 
Island, Fl., to Tom.  Not sure where its going from there.  Any ideas?


&gt;Tom/Mark,
&gt;
&gt;I have the hubcap and case; how do y'all want to handle a transfer?  
&gt;Thanks.
&gt;
&gt;Bill/Gainesville
