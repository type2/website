Subject: Re: [VB] '67 Model Year Questions

The dual MC was introduced at ch 217 019 487
the back up lights were also standard from partway through the model year, 
but at a different time.

so if your 67 was made early in the model year it may not have come with 
either.

&lt;&lt; Hi all,
 Question for the group:
 1967 deluxe bus - did this come with single circuit m/c and brakes or dual?
 Also, did this year bus have backup lights?
 TIA,
 -DB &gt;&gt;
