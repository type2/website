Subject: hub cap hand off

Just a note letting you all know the hub cap is moving once again.  A 
fellow club member and I took it to Dubuque yesterday and handed it off 
and it is now in Nebraska.  The bus ran PERFECT the whole 450-500 miles 
and ran nice and cool the whole way at 60-65mph.  A trip report will 
follow in the next few days, but when I got home last night, I was beat 
so I just went to sleep, and now must run off to work.

Isaiah
