Subject: Cargo door handle

I have a 66 bus, with a cargo door handle which I believe to be 221 841 631E as that is what it should be.  The lock barrel is good however the handle is in unrestorable condition.  I have found a handle with the same part number, but suffixed with a C, without the rectangular pin or barrel.  I know the keys changed between the two, but is this the only reason the letter was changed? ie would it be possible for me to use my good barrel and pin in this older handle?  Or are there other changes that I should be aware of?

Thanks a lot
Paul
