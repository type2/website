Fred,
Way to go!  You can't beat a bus for storage!  Isn't it strange after all 
these years that no one else has ever made a vehicle so practical as a bus?! 
  I could chug along all day in my vintage volksie on what gas is going for 
these days!  That's been a number of years ago, but I hope to rejoin with a 
bus soon!
Anyway, happy motoring and New Year, too!
Barry M. Rowland
