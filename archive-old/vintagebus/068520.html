Subject: windshield seal failure

Today I trashed my new passenger window seal trying to install it.  I 
had read tons of posts, and thought I had everything set.  The tar 
alone apparently did not lubricate the cord and inner lip of the seal 
enough, as my 2mm (.080 inch) round weedeater wire I had laying around 
started slicing through the seal about half way through.  Nice clean 
slice about 3 inches long.  I know Bentley recommends 3-4mm wire,  so 
I'll try switching to that, and also lube it up with some dish soap.  
I'm also considering using a blow dryer to heat up the rubber as I go 
around, as I'm doing this in the garage in 45 degree weather.   I take 
total blame for today's setback, as I know I was rushing.

Is it feasable and safe to reuse and try to reinstall this damaged 
seal, just to drive to DMV to get the bus registered?  I will order the 
new seal Monday, but I was really hoping to get this thing registered 
on Monday as well.

Thanks
Don 65 EZ
