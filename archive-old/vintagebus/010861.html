Welcome back NQ!
Glad to have you back,.....Just as another side to Mark,
I've been on this list for 3 years now, and I STILL feel like a newbie.   I 
have met some great people and made some even greater friends.   IMHO, the 
list and archives are some of the, if not the best sources of technical 
information out there.  I'd been lost  dozens of times without these guys. 
Use them, read them....contribute to em.

Viva el vintagebus!

&gt;  from all who care to give it.I dont know how many
&gt;  &quot;new&quot; people are on this list but my guess is I am not
&gt;  alone.And I find you guys in the know about VW stuff
&gt;  are talking over my head alot of the times and fights
&gt;  seem to start over things they should not.Some people
&gt;  will start things just to start things...
