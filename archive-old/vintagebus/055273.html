&gt;I'm trying to identify a few items on my '61 panelvan.  [...]  I'm
&gt;hoping against hope that I have at least a 64-67 axle beam so I can
&gt;switch to ball joints.  I couldn't read the first 3 numbers because
&gt;they are covered by the rubber stop (which is number 111 401 273),
&gt;the last 6 numbers on the beam are 635 682.

I don't have a chart of front axle serial numbers, but the rubber
stop part number (if correct and original) would seem to indicate
you have a pre-'64 front beam.  Take a look at callout no. 4 on
http://wow.atlasta_dot_net/~mriluvu/oacdp/5867part/255.png .  That
111 part is listed for axles up to '63 and for '64 and later it
goes to a 211 part.

The above page is part of the Online Air-Cooled Documentation
Project, http://wow.atlasta_dot_net/~mriluvu/oacdp/ . 

&gt;Also I have what I believe is a bug IRS transmission.

Can't help with this one.  My only comment is that all air-cooled
Volkswagens have independent rear suspension.  Late models used
CV joint axles (double jointed axles) instead of swing axles,
though.

Good luck!

Matt Roberds
