Earlier this week, someone placed an ad in the classifieds on my site,
basically copying my &quot;Sample&quot; ad.  Here's the content:

1956 Deluxe
$900 obo
Complete, 55K original miles, NOS parts, drive it home.

Since they put my email address, it was interesting to see the responses I
got, from &quot;Please mail photos.&quot; and &quot;Please describe condition.&quot; to &quot;Is this
a joke? If not, please email me.&quot;  If you saw an ad like that, what would
you do?
