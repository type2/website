Hi Andy,
You should be getting at least 180-200 miles from a tank full if you are
running a 1641cc engine and not drag racing.  Next time you fill it write
down the speedo mileage.  Then everytime you refill it mark down both the
fuel amount and speedo mileage.  Do this for at least 500 miles and see what
you get for MPG.  It is not a bad idea to do this and keep maintance info in
a log book.   Eric&amp;Barb
