Subject: pic of 25hp rockers?

anyone have a shot of 25hp rocker arms/shafts? i found an odd set in 
my boxes today... SHORT shafts; arms were very pronouncedly humped. 
looks like there is only room for 2 arms on each shaft! they DO have 
VW stamped in them, so a briggs and stratton is out!
i'll get a pic up tomorrow,,,,,,
