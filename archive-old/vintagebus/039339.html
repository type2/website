Hi list,

Is there anyone in the area between Pittsburgh and Johnstown Pa who would be 
so kind as to go look at a type 2 baywindow with me?  I live in blairsville, 
and the bus is about 15 miles from my house.  It is a camper, and seems ok, 
but I would like someone a little more knowledgable to go with me and see 
what it is worth,

does anyone have any suggestions of what I should look for, good or bad, 
things I should check for, (if it has, or doesnt have,) etc,

Any help would be greatlly appriciated,

Thanks,
Matt in Pa
