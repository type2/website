&gt;I started a new page today - Rare VW Buses
&gt;
&gt;Included are the tour bus, the barndoor-dash/vent-lip bus, a swiss army
&gt;bus, and some others.

The Bosch (?) bus has an interesting bumper.  I tried to do this once for
mounting fog lights -- got some steel and made bracket extenders.  But this
bus has a longer bumper, it seems.

The Swiss Army barndoor has the later taillight housings?
