Hi all,
I am spending a couple of weeks in Argentina, and have contacted a local VW 
&quot;guru&quot;, who has piles and piles of vintage parts. Can anyone give me a general 
idea of the cost of the following items? 
-'48 (according to him) bus steering wheel in very good shape.
-'VERY early Blaupunkt radio, with two big buttons and a separate amplifier 
box, in decent shape
-steering lock mechanism for early bus, with key.
-NOS front and rear bumpers (european, no over riders)

There are also hundreds of early bug parts. Let me know if anyone is looking 
for a hard to find bug part.
Any help is appreciated.
I've been invited to have dinner with the largest local VW club on Tue.
Hope all you wetwestians had a great time at Puyallup, see you soon.
