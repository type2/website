thanks for all the input...
I was not parked sideways...I was parked flat in my driveway.  My compression
test as of a couple weeks ago showed 120 +or- a couple pounds on each
cylinder...but all were VERY close to 120.  I couldn't believe it...I did the
test correctly too....per a manual.
The motor runs very strong and the bus is now a pleasure to drive.  Who
knows...maybe it was a fluke?  It happens very rarely so I'm really not that
worried about it....the motor doesn't leak oil or anything like that either...
oh well....

thanks
