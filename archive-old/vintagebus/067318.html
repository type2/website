I said that.  The stock heater in my '67 doesn't work very well(I'll work on
making it put out more later), so I just put a black cat in the cargo area
pointed through the walk-through section.  It's working pretty well.

&gt; Someone said they were using a propane tank and a black cat, besides
myself.
&gt; I thought that was you, but I thought you had just said you thought the
south
&gt; wind was the ticket! Just making sure, because I'm now looking for a south
&gt; wind. Laura
