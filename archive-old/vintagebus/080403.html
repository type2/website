Josh, an investment in a new 30/31 PICT-3 is the way to go. I've had
carbs rebushed for as little as $55 but finding someone in your local
area familiar with Solex carbs is another thing. Even after the rebush I
have them sonic cleaned to shake loose the particulate matter in the
carb and then a thorough wash and a new rebuild kit.

yeah, the carb needs re bushed. where can i get this
done? and about how much should it cost? id much
rather just get a new one so i wouldnt have to worry
about this for a while. this carb has never been
rebuilt, it has all the origional gaskets.
