Subject: Re: [VB] generators, DC&gt;AC conversion, sacrilegious mods, etc.

My thought would be don't do it.  It's just as easy to make/buy a bracket to
mount the radio under the dash or parcel tray.  This bus may never be on the
show circuit again; but if you ever have to sell the bus, then a modified
dash probably won't be very appealing to the next owner.

&gt; Im also considering a sacrilegious modification to my dashboard. My
original
&gt; radio knockoff plate is still installed and the dash in mint shape. I have
&gt; seen a weld job so sweet on this as to seem factory : welding in a section
&gt; that eliminates the knockoff. It really looks better than stock. Realising
&gt; that this bus will never be on the show circuit, certain non-stock mods
are
&gt; now seeming more appealing... Thoughts?
