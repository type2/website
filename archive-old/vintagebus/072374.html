Subject: Westy wave ? Huh!

Since I sold my 83 Westfalia I am reduced to having some real fun driving
my 66 Split window Westy.
While out terrorizing the neighborhood a fellow in a new Euro Van (or
whatever they call them new fangled, Winnebago jobs) gave me a real big
wave.
Well folks in a Split window you can't just throw your arm out the window
and wave so I didn't slam my funny bone trying to return his wave.
We come to a stop at the same red light a few miles down the road and he
gave me a scowl that would make the grinch cringe.
Then it hit me .................. hell I don't want to be in his club
anyway.
No hard feelings to the guy in the EV but you just got to get yourself a
splittie and it'll about break you from waving at other VW vans.
