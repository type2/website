&gt; My .02...
&gt; 
&gt; I have had &quot;Jupiter&quot; brand? tires on my Vanagon for years, and intend to put
&gt; them on both splitties, if I ever get them on the road again.  They come in
&gt; 6 and 8-ply (that I know of), cost about $100/pair installed, last a long
&gt; time and feel like a dream on the road.  I highly recommend these tires.  I
&gt; don't, however, know of any limitation on the choice when it comes to sizes.
&gt; 
&gt; Call up your nearest Big O Tire place...that's where I got mine.

Jupiter and Merit are both &quot;house brands&quot; of Hercules tires.  They are
good tires, available in the proper 185R14 size in load range C or D.
When I last checked, the C and D tires were not M+S rated, while the
passenger-load tire was.  Same tread pattern too.  It's been a couple of
years, so they might have gotten around to having them certified in the
higher load range.

Don't be tempted by the passenger-load rated version.  I had two of these
tires separate their treads before I wised up.
