A while back there was some discussion on the Lists about shelters for
storing/protecting buses.  Some folks bought the COSTCO rig for ~ $180.00.
Others tried to find them without success.

As of last week our local COSTCO has them back in stock -- the same one they
sold last Fall.  And the price has gone DOWN to $150.00.

FWIW.....
