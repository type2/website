OK. This is my often mentioned 1600cc DP engine that came in my '59 
Kombi. I had to take it out, tear it down, and overhaul it. Got it 
back together and installed in the bus. Now the engine turns, but 
will not fire up. I'm getting fuel to the carb just fine.

I've replaced the coil, spark plug cables, spark plugs, condenser, 
points, and have a nice strong battery in there. I've also cleaned 
the contacts on the disty cap and roter.
...

get out your test light bulb.  turn the ignition on.   ground the test light 
and touch the other end to the black wire (this leads fromthe ig switch)  at 
the 15 side of the coil.   it should be getting power there with the gnition 
on.    If you dont have power there your bus will not run, and something is 
messed up.

  nowput the non grounded end at the other side of the coil- the one with the 
wire to the condensor.  Get your 21mm wrench (or 19 if you have the wrong 
size nut) and turn the engine round .  The light should light up once every 
half turn of the crank pully, at the place you set your timing, then go out 
about a 1/4 turn later.   

you can also remove the dist cap and watch the points and they should spark 
at the place you set the timing when you turn the motor round.   Or put your 
screwdrver in there and ontact both side of the contact points and make a 
spark.   no spark- no engine run. 

Another thing I have done is turn the motor over to #1, and pull the #1 spark 
plg wire of #1 on the dist cap and put a dist to coil wire on there,   now 
hold it just a 1/8&quot; away from ground with a rag while you turn the engine 
with a wrench, you can just turn it back and forth- it should spark.  

so the spark is great

do you have the spark plug wires on right- remember 1-4-3-2.

It is also possible that the dist drive gear is in backwards- you can double 
check this with looking at the valves.   IF so, you will have to change them 
all 180*.  (unless you have a dist drive puller and feel comforatble with 
switching it round.)   if all your wires are off 180* it will not run and it 
can be frustrating.

hope some of this helps
