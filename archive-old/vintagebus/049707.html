Hey Volks

I returned from one of my regular long treks about a month ago, and I've
finally managed to get the first part of the trip written down for anyone
who's interested. This one was not as smooth as previous long journeys,
with mechanical hassles finally catching up with me. But we'll get to that;
let's start at the beginning :-)

Since late January I spent most of my free time preparing my 1963 Dormobile
for another long road trip. For a while now I had been using the 1600DP
engine from my POS beater panelvan whenever I wanted to use the Dormobile
for a trip, ever since the Dormobile's VW factory reconditioned 1600SP
engine threw its number four rod after 24 000km.

But after a fight I got VW to agree that the engine's failure was most
likely due to some fault on assembly and they replaced it with a shiny
near-new item with a brand new Brazilian AS41 case, new P&amp;Cs and
reconditioned heads with totally new valves and rocker gear. This motor had
been sitting in its delivery crate in my garage for about 18 months, and I
was finally making the time to put it into the Dormobile.

I went through my parts stash and selected the best tinwork, unworn heat
exchangers and smartest-looking ancillaries that I could find. I massaged a
larger DP fan into a SP shroud. Faced with a selection of 12 volt
generators and no easy way to test them, I chose the one that I had used
for the longest on a driving car -- a decision that was to come back and
haunt me later. I was delayed by my inability to easily track down the
correct exhaust. This sort of thing is happening more often to me nowadays
-- consumable parts that were previously not a problem to find now becoming
unavailable.

A local exhaust chain said it is obsolete and their factory will never make
any more. My main VW FLAPS couldn't help me, and a VW speed shop that I use
in the last resort offered me some kewl 4-1 thing that exits in the right
wheelwell. No thanks, I said, I want stock, so they promised to import me
one from Brazil within three days. But of course three days turned to 10
and still there was no exhaust for me. The first chain finally located a
silencer for me, the last one in their possession, dredged up from a
country dealer's stock, but they did not have the S-bend, which I had to
have fabbed up for me by a racing exhaust specialist using the old one as a
pattern.

I only got the complete exhaust in my hands on Saturday February 13, and I
had planned to depart early on my 34th birthday, Monday February 15,
incidentally also the fourth anniversary of my acquiring the Dormobile. The
engine had been waiting in the car since the previous weekend, but I was
unable to start it without the exhaust.

On Sunday morning I had the car ready to start, but it wouldn't. I
double-checked that the distributor drive wasn't 180 degrees out, I put in
a new condenser, swapped out the coil, checked out all the ignition wiring
and the near-new fuel pump. By late afternoon my battery was flat and the
new engine would only offer the occasional half-hearted splutter, but
wouldn't catch.

I put the battery on charge and spent the evening with my sister and her
husband, who were about to leave Johannesburg permanently after he was
transferred to Cape Town. I resigned myself to not leaving on the appointed
day and enjoyed the evening.

Early Monday morning I dismantled the carb. I had already opened and
cleaned it and fitted a new accelerator pump diaphragm before installing
it. At the time I had noticed a nasty corrosion residue that would not be
dissolved by any of the solvents I tried but, since the jets and the
emulsion tube were unblocked, I thought it would be OK.

But now with the carb full of fuel I was able to check out the accelerator
pump -- not a drip. I opened the whole thing up again and a closer
inspection than my previous one revealed that the gluey remains of whatever
decomposed fuel had been in the carb had gummed up all its drilled internal
passages. A little lesson: drain the carb before putting it in storage.

My next best 30PICT carb has badly worn throttle bushings, but a new
Brazilian 31PICT would have cost nearly my entire fuel budget for the trip,
so I installed the worn carb and the new engine roared to life at the
second attempt.

I still had to have two helicoils fitted to my right reduction box mounts
before I could leave, which necessitated a drive across town to the
transmission shop. I used the 80km (50 mile) round trip to do the initial
run-in on the new engine. I had originally hoped to be driving the
Dormobile on its new engine for at least a week before I left, to sort out
any teething problems, but that was not to be. Anyway, the engine was
smooth, with even power delivery and no obvious oil leaks. It was running a
little hot, but I supposed it was a bit tight.

By the time I returned to my garage it was lunch time. My ex-wife had
fetched my girls from school and we all had a birthday lunch together. I
decided I would leave after lunch, not being able to face the thought of
spending another night of my leave in Johannesburg. This was to be a solo
trip. With the recent break-up of my marriage and increasing stress at
work, I needed to spend some time alone taking stock of where my life is
going, and no better way for me than on a road trip in a split-screen VW
bus.

After lunch I packed up all my tools and camping gear into the Dormobile
and hit the road right in the afternoon rush hour at about 4.30pm. Never
mind, I had to get out of town. I was making for Cape Town once again, 1
400km away by the quickest route, but I was committed to deep back roads
all the way, which would take the distance up to about 2 000km.

Once out of the worst of the urban sprawl I was able to escape the
stop-start driving on the secondary route directly south to Vereeniging, a
stinking industrial town on the banks of the Vaal river. I was keeping my
brand new engine below 70km/h in 4th, and constantly varying speed between
60 and 70km/h (35-40mph) to ensure it was running in properly. I thought of
Clara and her &quot;driving aggressively slower than everyone else&quot;, and backed
off the accelerator again. Traffic was quite heavy and moving slowly on the
single-lane road.

By sunset I was past the worst of the foul smog of the
Vereeniging/Vanderbijlpark smokestack zone. I decided to overnight at
Heilbron, a small, dusty agricultural town with a clean campsite on a
pretty dam near the centre of town. I arrived after dark, having covered
some 250km, and made a point of preparing myself a cooked birthday dinner,
which I enjoyed alone over a couple of cold beers. Then I showered and set
my alarm for 5am, before going straight to sleep.

I awoke in the pre-dawn light, and enjoyed my first view of the
surroundings over a cup of coffee, before packing up and heading out. I
filled up with fuel before leaving town, and noticed that the starter motor
seemed a  little slow, but it was a bit chilly in the dawn and the bus
started, so I thought nothing of it. Then I settled in to a slow drive,
keeping as directly south as I could on secondary roads. I was now pushing
the bus up to 80km/h (50mph) before letting it drop back to 70 and building
up speed again. I was getting into the rhythm of constant gentle
acceleration and deceleration and, since there was no other traffic at all,
I wasn't pissing off anyone behind me.

As the sun rose, I had hoped to be able to see a partial eclipse that was
supposed to be visible just after sunrise that day, but a cloud bank on the
horizon kept me from glimpsing the sun (through raybans and welding
goggles). I stopped the bus at the roadside when the sun eventually crested
the cloud and took in the changing light of the new day, which was set to
be clear and bright.

But when I tried to get moving again, the engine wouldn't turn over -- flat
battery. And flat road, so I couldn't push-start. Fortunately there was
some traffic on the road by then and the first passing farmer I showed my
jumper cables to stopped his pick-up and gave me a jump-start.

I continued driving slowly south on rural back roads through the Free State
province, passing several small hamlets, Petrus Steyn, Senekal and
Marquard, before I arrived in the town of Ladybrand on the border with
Lesotho (a tiny, landlocked, mountainous kingdom completely surrounded by
South Africa). This stretch of the central Free State is quite boring, with
no trees and endless grassy plains under cattle interspersed with fields of
maize and sunflowers. In Ladybrand I stopped at an auto fitment centre and
asked them to check my battery and charging system. In between serving
other customers the guy at the counter instructed a labourer to check my
battery, which they said was bad.

I bought a new one and insisted they still check the charging system, but
the place was so chaotic I gave up waiting and left with my new battery,
R220 (US$40) lighter of wallet.

After Ladybrand the road hugs the Lesotho border for a few hundred
kilometres, past the towns of Hobhouse and Wepener, before hitting one of
the main highways to the coast at Rouxville. This section of the route was
quite scenic, with the Maluti mountains in Lesotho rising on my left. The
last time I had driven this section of road it was in appalling condition,
with potholes all over and, on the worse sections, the tar had been ripped
up to leave a passable gravel surface. This time the road was better. Its
many patches made the surface rather bumpy, but at least all the potholes
had been filled and the completely wrecked sections resurfaced.

At Rouxville I turned west for about 30km on a main route, before heading
south again at the town of Smithfield on another secondary. I was surprised
at how much ground I was covering despite keeping the speed between 70 and
80km/h. Before long I crossed the Orange River, South Africa's biggest
river, at the village of Bethulie, which is at the start of the large
Gariep Dam, formerly named after Hendrik Verwoerd, the architect of
apartheid.

I stopped for petrol at Bethulie. A check of dipstick temp showed the new
engine running at the hot end of what I would consider normal for a SP
motor. Oil didn't need topping up and there were no signs of leaks. I
figured that by late afternoon I'd have put 1 000km (600 miles) on the
engine and it would be time for an oil change and tappet adjust.

The bridge across the Orange was very long and very old. The concrete slabs
that made up the surface had all sagged in the middle, causing a rather
disconcerting undulating feeling as the Dormobile drove across. On the
other side I pulled off onto a farm road and stopped under some trees for a
quick lunch.

The Orange river marks the border between the Free State and the Eastern
Cape province, and I was now travelling in an arid region known as the
Karoo. It was getting quite hot, and the scenery was not much to talk
about. I covered the empty miles on that little-used road occupied by my
thoughts.

I kept on moving, keeping below 80km/h for the rest of the afternoon
through unbroken miles of monotonous plains, punctuated by the occasional
rocky hill, until I reached the range of hills before Graaff Reinet, a
historic town in the centre of the Karoo, in the dusk. As I made the twisty
descent down the 1:16 Lootsberg pass in the failing light, I was overtaken
by a long-distance bus (Greyhound-type) on a solid white line ahead of a
blind corner. I was busy cursing the driver for endangering my life and
those of his passengers when a second bus, belonging to a different
company, came blasting past, rocking the Dormobile in its wake. It looked
like the drivers were racing each other. About twice a year one of these
buses crashes, usually after the driver loses control following a blow-out
or trying to avoid an obstacle while speeding, resulting in scores of
deaths and injuries.

Just after dark the odomoeter racked up 600 miles on the new engine. Before
long I arrived in Graaff Reinet and made straight for the municipal
campsite. I paid at the office and came out to find the Dormobile wouldn't
start. My new battery was flat; it was the charging system as I'd
suspected. The camp manager and his wife and daughter push started me ...

I drove around a bit in the dark trying to find a site bordering a slope so
I could start the car next morning. The camp was nearly empty, with a few
caravans and a couple of German overlanders in a Mercedes Gelandewagen. I
found a site at the edge of a slight slope, which was neither too close nor
too far from the ablution block.

I parked, then got out and walked round the bus to open the side doors. But
suddenly I became aware of several sharp bites on my legs. I leapt into the
back of the bus and turned on the interior light. There were dozens of
large black ants rushing around my legs. I grabbed a torch and shone it on
the ground outside. There were kadzillions of the little buggers rushing
around excitedly, congregating even more densely in the patches where I'd
trodden and crushed their comrades. Perfect, I'd set up camp in the middle
of an ant nest. Since it was the only site near a slope, I figured I'd have
to stay put and hope the ants didn't get into the Dormobile. I prepared my
evening meal inside the bus, and entertained myself by watching the ants
demolish and remove large scraps of food I had thrown on the ground. I
imagined myself waking in the night covered in voracious ants invading my
bus, like some character in a Hitchcock movie.

Afterwards I gathered my toiletries and climbed out onto one of the bus's
tyres so I could lock the door. Then I leapt as far from the bus I could
and scooted off for a shower. On the way I shone my torch on the ground to
see the ants were everywhere, though not in quite the same concentration as
around my camp. On my return I stood on a small rock a few feet away from
the bus to unlock the door, then jumped in. I still had to remove a few
ants from my legs before making the bed and going to sleep.
