Subject: 64-67 back window question

I was looking at all the scratches in the back window of my 66 Deluxe and
then I looked at my 77 Westy heated back window......
I measured the opening.....top to bottom and side to side were identical.
Then I looked up both seals in a WCM catalog...... both are the same,
211-521C.
Both windows are Sekurit......
I can get bay back windows all day long along with bay rear defogger
switches....
So my question is: has anyone put a heated bay back window in a split??
