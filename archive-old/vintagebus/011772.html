	I got my motor torn completely down and the case taken apart...I
am using Tom Wilsons book and its fairly easy to follow....Now for the
hard part...rebuilding it correctly. This is my first time doing this but
its cool....I like the sense of accomplishment...kind a hard to
explain....But its like if I can read this book and rebuild this motor..I
can do anything...Weird but cool... Let ya know how it goes....
