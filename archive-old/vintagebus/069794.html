Subject: Re: [VB] side scoops any opinions

I don't think I have ever seen a study that proved a decrease in temps due to the installation of side scoops. I have seen studies that involved external coolers and the like but nothing on the scoops. 
My feeling is that if during the production of splits (that ran around 17 years compared to Bay production that lasted 12 years) were it found beneficial to change the design of the air intakes I think it would have been done previous to the introduction of the 68 model Transporter. The only changes to the vents were cosmetic as far as I know, from Barndoor to non-Barndoor ( I think they have more vents?) and from the 55 to pre 63 out facing vents to the 64 and later inward facing vents. At that tme (a long time ago!) VW cared about it's customers and its reputation and it would have been benfical for them to make improvements that would have prolonged the life of their cars.
