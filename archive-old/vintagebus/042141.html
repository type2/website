I put an old one in for caravanning to BBB with Mike Visket.  Don't get
too elaborate with these because even the best installation won't talk
reliably beyond a mile or so.  Mag mount or drip-rail mount antennas work
fine.

I'd suggest that if a group wants to caravan and they're considering
radios they look at the little FRS handhelds.  No installation at all and
you get the same range as CB's without the annoying skip and
toilet-mouthed idiots.

Of course, I _love_ my amateur radio gear, but you have to take a test and
all that to use that stuff.  When I was waiting in line at BBB in Havasu I
talked to my father in Reno, NV, about 500 miles away, with my Icom 706
mobile
rig.
