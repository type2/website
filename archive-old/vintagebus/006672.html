Yep. I'm getting ready to hack up a 67 Rivera camper, it needs 1 rocker and
front floors, to get the pieces for my barndoor, this bus is straight and
restorable but the pieces will go to save a few other buses. This bus was
offered at BBB IV for 500.00 or best offer and every one sconned at it,
O'Well at least a few people will get some good pieces.

Yep, Thoms backyard looks like the WW all over again! Except no Kubels or
KDF 
stamps! Just some rusty bus parts.
That panel had seen its last days.
And I'm sure if Thom offered it for 1500$ (Its value in parts!???) noone 
would even THINK to pay 1500 and ANOTHER 1500 to have it shipped to a 
location where its more desirable.
I've seen nicer busses get hit by the saw.
Rust free, collision free barndoor deluxes........butchered because &quot;It was 
kinda beat up, needed an interior&quot;
And a barndoor sunroof standard original paint/interior with LOGOS butchered

because someone wanted the interior and another person wanted the 
bumpers!!!!!!! WHY!!!!!????
Im not one to talk, I've mutilated a few busses which SHOULD HAVE and COULD 
have been saved if the time and desire was there.
