Subject: Speedo includes a Fuel Gauge??!!
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Hi all-

I have a speedometer (VDO) that also has a fuel gauge in it.  Came in a early
bus.  Is this unusual? or something someone just stole from a later bug or
something?  It looks and fits exactly like any normal speedo.  Just wondering.

Thanks

Gerald
