Subject: What model is my Eberspacher?

The tag reads as follows from top to bottom:

1750
6
Benzin
~~S 015
8573
1561
(next box is blank)

Ive looked all thru the library at type2_dot_com and i dont see a pic of this
anywhere. I hear everyone talking about BN4 and BNH  but mine doesnt even
seem to match those. All similar tags that i found in the type 2 library
have totally different information then mine. Only thing i can figure out
from the tag is thats its a 6volt. It is original to my 58 binz and
everything is screw terminal connections. Also is it unusual for the heater
to be mounted where the spare goes? Ive never seen it and i assume that big
T tube is extra special.

heres a few pics

(that weird thing on the wires where they attach to the black box in the
first pic, looks kind of like a connector or something,  its just a big
piece of broken glass laying there)
Can take more pics if necessary
Any help appreciated
