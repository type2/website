I met Joe at the Woodburn Show here in Oregon (BTW it happens again this June
5!).  He smelled my coffee pot brewing from about 100 yards away.  He strolled
up wet to the bone (it rained like hell that morning) and ask if that smell
was what he thought it was.  He sorta remained me of that little kid in Oliver
&quot;Sir, may I have some coffee please&quot;.  I produced a cup and my extra wide brim
hat, and made a friend for life.  Off and on through the day I talked to Joe,
he went into extreme detail about his type 4 conversion kits and also talked
quite a bit about the Mikey 5 speed.  I found him quite enjoyable and see him
at most of the shows I go to.  I always have coffee on and a spare cup.  For
my trouble I get a hug and one of the greatest smiles I've ever seen.  So
before you start calling people names you should consider how new this
wonderful space we call cyber land is.  Joe's old school--very old school.  If
you could have phoned him he probably would have talked your ear off.  I
imagine that sitting in front of a computer screen for an hour and a half
answering e-mails is just, shall we say, just not his cup of coffee.  I as
seemed to remember that he has an information pack about his conversion for
sale for around $5.00.  This should answer any questions you might have.
   Peace, Love, and  (Shameless Plug)---&gt; Woodburn Dragstrip, Woodburn Oregon,
