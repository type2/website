&gt; So which is it folks? This is a single port intake manifold from a 1964
&gt; 1500, which is now being bolted to a new 1600 SP. 6mm studs... The Bentley
&gt; for 1961-1967 doesn't say, just says to tighten evenly by hand. The Wilson
&gt; book and apstockton_at_hotmail_dot_com say 14 ft. lbs.. VeeWee111_at_aol_dot_com says
&gt; 6 ft. lbs. like the sump nuts.
&gt; 
&gt; I've tried 14 ft. lbs., and snapped one of the studs. So is it really 6
&gt; ft. lbs. and I'm one the way to ruining more studs if I torque to 14 ft.
&gt; lbs?


Well, you broke one trying to tighten it to 14 ft. lbs, so that should
tell you something. 8^) Just remember that the size of the fastener
tells you a lot about how much torque it's meant to take. Small
fasteners like M6 are only meant to hold small loads. It has to do with
the cross sectional area of the fastener. Higher torque = higher load. 6
ft. lbs is plenty for an M6 fstener. Avoid using a 3/8&quot; ratchet on the
M6 nuts and bolts. A 1/4&quot; ratchet makes it a lot easier to feel how
tight they are without breaking them.
