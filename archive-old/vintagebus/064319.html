Subject: Re: Distributor issues

Thank you all for the hints, tips and help.

Unfortunately, work and life beyond the bus must continue and we are not going
to be able to get around to touching the engine again until this Friday.
However, we are reading your input and building our game plan.  We appreciate
your offers for help and will hopefully get the old girl on the road by this
weekend.

I'll keep the post posted on progress.
Greg &amp; Dan
