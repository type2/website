Subject: carb doesn't fit with altenator..
Mime-Version: 1.0

This question is being posted for a friend of mine....he's got a '63 Westy 
that he's restoring.

His problem is this. He built up a 1641DP engine to put in the bus. He put 
an altenator on the engine instead of a generator. He has a new BOCAR 34 
PICT carb, bus seems to have some interference with the altenator. I  think 
he said it was the linkage or something.

Anyone recognize this problem? What's the solution.

I told him I'd get back to him with some help ASAP...so fire away!
