Subject: bungie cords
Date: Sat, 22 Jan 2000 22:47:48 -0800

today my truck is without them!  about two weeks ago it lost the bungie cord
holding the front bumper up and today it lost the bungie cord holding the
engine lid closed!  two weeks ago i got my hands on a pair of bumper
brackets and today i got my hands on a rear apron that'll work with my 1600
muffler.  it's really amazing how much better it looks without bungie cords!
i thought (and still do) that the new monster (6.70x15) truck tires improved
its looks 100% and now that it's without bungie cords i might well have a
show car!  haha!  today while i was making things work better i thought that
i'd fit up the break light and license light so that the truck be a little
more legal.  the break light bulb holder is all trashed but since some
previous owner fitted later model taillights and wired them for the break
lights, i figured i could at least use the license light bulb holder while
also covering the hole for the break light in the engine lid.  my truck
looks so great from the rear now that the engine lid has no holes and it
closes properly on an apron!  it started to rain tonight but darn if the
track isn't thinking it's king of the road!  who needs wipers?  not us!  who
needs proper type 2 headlights instead of beetle lights, not us!  this is
great!  i feel wonderful and the truck seems to be happy too!

cheers,
