&gt; I need to second Jim's annoyance with VW magazine publishers for
&gt; avoiding great, popular VW events like Jerome.  A VW bus camp that
&gt; some
&gt; of you folks may have missed, but certainly the VW magazines have
&gt; missed
&gt; is the VW Bus Camp at Burning Man.  This camp is one amoungst the
&gt; thousand or so camps that set up in the Nevada Desert around Labor
&gt; Day
&gt; at Burning Man. This is the best VW Camp/Show/Party on the planet! 

If you read the FAQ for the media on the Burning Man website, you'll
get an idea of why it isn't covered by the VW rags.  The media pays the
same entrance fees as the public, pays higher &quot;in and out&quot; fees, and
must go through a manditory indoctrination process.  This probably
serves to keep out all the media except those who are really &quot;into it&quot;.
 Not a bad policy if you want to avoid bad press!
