Subject: Re: [VB] Redux Boxes?

That is exactly what I wanted to hear.  Thanks to everybody who replied.

Andrew
67 Deluxe Bus
75 914 1.8 (for sale)


&gt; I suspect than Jake hasn't pulled a RGBox apart and looked at the RGears.
they are much sturdier than the gears in the tranny center section.
&gt;
&gt;  they do reduce the gearing, of course, which is why they are called
reduction gears.  and which is why sometimes people who put big motors in
the buses remove the RGBs to make the gearing higher.
&gt; Then put in a 3.88 r/p with a .77 4th so you can cruise at 80mph and not
wind it out, still hear the stereo.
&gt; If you have enough motor for that gearing.
