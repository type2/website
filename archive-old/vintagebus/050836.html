Subject: Re: [VB] Buying bus parts

I'm just happy to find good service at all, I dont care how I get it. If I
had judged some retailers on their response times to emails, or how updated
their website was I would have missed out. Example: I have never had good
luck e-mailing to ronnie(old volks) but if you call him with your questions
he'll tell you everything you need to know, if he's busy when you call, he
calls back quickly on his dime.
A part number on a website won't tell you if the part is of good quality,
where it came from, or if you really even need to replace it, so why rely on
it so heavily. As for follow ups, if I need something else I'll call back.
no need to waste everyones time and $, because money spent on needless call
backs and follow up letters is $ tacked on to the price of your parts.
Answer my questions, sell me quality parts and I'll be back specials or no.
I've found that if I seek out retailers who do it because they actually like
vws it all works out in the end.

as for working on a car you know nothiong about, How else do you learn?
