Subject: My bus is killing me...

I bought Lucy the 21 window beauty a year and a half ago. I have been
plagued with the same problem or close to it again and again and again
and again. 

 

Symptoms: 

Can't get bus into gear. shifting works when engine not running.
Sometimes happened gradually sometimes sudden. 

 

1.	Broke clutch cable. 7/99 
2.	Broke an actuator fork 7/99. (replaced all components - clutch,
pressure plate, t/o bearing, actuator fork) 
3.	Ate up a T/O bearing so bad that it wore down to the pressure
plate fingers and the clutch actuator fork was beginning to rub pressure
plate too. (replaced all components again) 
4.	Now everything is new. Wife drove bus and snap! Can't get it
into gear. Clutch actuates in about same place though, just once out of
gear, there is no getting it back into gear. 

 

My thoughts.

This is happening because the tranny is spinning EVEN with clutch in.
HOW does this happen????

When I start the car with the clutch in I can feel a slight pull on the
tranny/bus). Then the clutch engages at the same point it did before
this happened. The clutch seems to work fine. This would point to the
bearing behind the gland nut or binding of the input shaft. 

How does binding the input shaft normally occur? I thought that this
happened because all 3 (of 4) nuts were loose holding the engine in. I
took the engine out, checked the gland nut bearing (put grease on it)
and put everything back together. The engine is in tight now and it is
still happening. I haven't replaced the gland nut bearing.

 

Any thoughts??? 

 

TIA,
