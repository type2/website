hi all,

Just got back from my first mini road trip in my 61 (bout 200 miles or so 
total, a nice afternoon drive)

I used that green locktite to fix the repro mirror vibration problem.

i just put a drop of the green locktite between that washer with the part
number on it and the aluminum back of the mirror and wiggled it a tad.
You could see that the loctite had wicked down between the mirror and the
washer all the way around.

About 20 minutes later the mirror was locked to that post VERY solidly.
no more vibration whatsoever.  the green loctite even secured the drivers
side one that had fallen apart altogether.

give it a shot.. if you put too much on, just wipe it off before it
dries.. this takes a while, so no need to rush, and its easy to wipe off
too. You couldnt tell it was on there unless you got up and put your eye
just a couple of inches away and looked between the washer and the morror
body... really cant tell.

take care,

Steve
