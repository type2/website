Subject: nose repair Q

Hello listees,

I am beginning the bodywork on the nose of my '64 westy.  i knew there was 
some bondo there, but the more I work at it, the more I find.  Sigh.  It 
looks like i will need to replace the nose section.  Now the question, what 
is the best way to do this.  I have seen thom's page for the nose 
replacement he did on the VB panel, it looks like the WW pieces are a pretty 
good fit.  In a thread awhile ago, it was mentioned that the schofield nose 
repair consists of alot of pieces and it is hard to get together.  Is is 
easier to weld in a piece from an old bus, or use the WW pieces?  Anybody 
out there done both, and can comment?  I don't have alot of welding 
experience, so I'm looking for the easiest way to do this, but I do want it 
to look right when I'm done.  It looks like I will just need to do from 
below the headlight buckets, alot like what thom had to do.

TIA,

Mike Anderson
