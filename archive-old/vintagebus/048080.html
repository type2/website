  In my search for the elusive truck canopy hoops, I was told that you can 
still get 2 styles from Brazil VW. The original high top and a lowered even 
with the roofline style. Since I have not seen either one does anyone know 
how to contact a supplier???? Or does someone happen to have a set laying 
around for sale. I've been told you can get them at VW meets, but in the 
Chicago area there are not held often and when they do have one there's not 
alot for the trucks. I'm ready to order the canvas from PLF, but I want to 
get the hoops 1st.  Any help will be appreciated.
