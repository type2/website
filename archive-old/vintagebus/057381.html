Subject: RE: [VB] Finally passed CO emissions inspection

This is exactly the point I'm trying to make here:  I
found a way to have my cake and eat it too.  I passed
emissions with a 110 cam.  I'm 60% below the limits
and performance is great!

&gt; The problem with a performance motor and emissions

&gt; jets to 127/50, but it
&gt; will run really bad at the hi end. If your only trip

&gt; after you pass.

&gt; 
&gt; Our bus is a 1967 deluxe.  Engine:  original block,
&gt; now 1600 cc w/dual port heads, C/W crank, 110 cam,
&gt; 34
&gt; PICT carb, extractor ehaust.  This bus has a history
&gt; of failing emmisions.  The P.O. tried about 4 times,
&gt; but all the tweaking in the world couldn't overcome
&gt; the cam.   He finally, temporarily, put in a loaner
&gt; engine from a junkyard (with one dead cylinder!) in
&gt; order to pass the test (in CO it is seller's
&gt; responsibility).  Now, unfortunately, we have to
&gt; part
&gt; with this beautiful bus.  So, now it was our turn to
&gt; get a &quot;clean air colorado cert&quot;.  With the 009 dizzy
&gt; that the P.O. installed, it was hopeless.  I put on
&gt; a
&gt; reman. V.A. dizzy and got a much better idle.  Huge
&gt; amount of advance at idle; around 40 degrees, but
&gt; still a loping idle that won't fire on every stroke
&gt; despite any tweak.  Anyway, the bus runs so much
&gt; better with the v.a. dizzy (better response, gas
&gt; mileage, idle) that I can't imagine running an 009
&gt; again except in special situations like dual carbs. 
&gt; First attempt at CO emissions; 1800 ppm HC at idle,
&gt; with a limit of 1000.  At 2500 RPM, HC was at about
&gt; 800, under the limit.   I found out that the spec
&gt; for
&gt; &quot;idle&quot; goes up to 1350 RPM, so on the next try, I
&gt; advanced the static timing all the way to 12 degrees
&gt; (rule of thumb is that here in the Rockies we should
&gt; run 5 degrees more advanced than flatlanders), set
&gt; the
&gt; idle just below 1350, played around some more with
&gt; the
&gt; 34 PICT's idle air and mixture screws.  With the
&gt; cam,
&gt; the carb adjustments are rather insensitive.  Seemed
&gt; to idle best with the air screw about wide open and
&gt; the mixture screw completelyclosed.  I settled on a
&gt; half-turn open on the mixture screw.  In the test,
&gt; all
&gt; this tweaking was good for 1600 HC, still way over
&gt; the
&gt; 1000 limit.
&gt; 
&gt; Now, here's the good part.  Maybe this is an old
&gt; trick, but I haven't heard of it.  I went to Ken's
&gt; Muffler in Longmont, CO, and had them unbolt the
&gt; muffler at the 3-bolt flange and replace it with a
&gt; cat.  Basically, they had to fabricate a 3-bolt
&gt; flange
&gt; attached to a catalytic converter attached to a
&gt; tailpipe.  Simply replaced the muffler with a cat. 
&gt; Cost:  $200.   She's a bit loud, but not bad enough
&gt; to
&gt; make the neighbors complain.  The cat does act as a
&gt; muffler to an extent.  Certainly quieter than, say,
&gt; a
&gt; stinger.  Went to the inspection station and came in
&gt; at 400 HC.  Way, way under spec for all
&gt; requirements,
&gt; including HC and CO.  I'm happy with this solution. 
&gt; I
&gt; tossed the muffler under the rear seat and if the
&gt; new
&gt; owner wants more quiet, it's a matter of 3 bolts to
&gt; switch back from cat to muffler.  Anybody running a
&gt; cam might find themselves in this position.  It's
&gt; tough to get a good (legal) idle with a cam.  On the
&gt; other hand, if you are the kind of person to run a
&gt; cam, you probably have an extractor exhaust, too. 
&gt; If
&gt; you have an extractor, it's easy to bolt on a cat,
&gt; which can easily get you through the test for fairly
&gt; short money, considering.
