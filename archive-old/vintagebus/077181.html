this message was sent to me via the type 2 mailing list, if anyone can help out, please do! 


Kyle is heading to NC 
He is in walterboro, SC , he is at the bleep off 95 near mile 
53. He 
called me from a payphone and said he would try and stay near. His 
number 
at that pay phone is 843 538 3914 

He Has a 79 Automatic that is pouring tranny fluid between engine and 
tranny. It is red fluid so is tranny fluid. 

Needs a gasket and a place to work. Or if ya just want to try and 
help. 

He has never attempted an engine drop and doesn't have many tools. If 
any 
one could help him out or point him in right direction. Give him a 
call. I 
got this call at 3:15 PM Sun. 

 
 and here's the update:
 
I just got an update from Kyle. 
They ended up getting a hotel room at the Friendly Motor Inn Room #17 
843 
549 5552 

They haven't been able to figure out which part they need so if you 
have any 
knowledge of a 79 automatic they could sure use it. 

The recap: 
79 Automatic Westy in Walterboro, SC need to get to NC. 

Tranny is pouring tranny fluid and now if they start it it sounds like 
grinding rocks. 

The parts houses around there keep asking them about a sleeve??? 

Please help if ya can... Even if it is just to talk with them to try 
and 
figure out what they need to get. 



please help!!! if it was you, wouldnt you want help?
