I've been told by every local vw guy in my town, (ventura, Ca) to stay away from the 34pct carbs. I was running one on my last motor, with a 009 dist, and it never worked right, hard to set the idle, flat spots, cutting out coming off the freeway, etc. It improved slightly when I changed my dist, to a brand new single vacuum advance one, no more flat spots, but other problems persisted. This is a recently rebuilt carb mind you, very clean. 
I'm willing to accept the small loss of power the small carb gives if it will work otherwise. Unless someone has some Kadrons they want to get rid of.
Thanks to all who pointed out I might have a vacuum leak by the way.
