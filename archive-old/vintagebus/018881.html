I just went and looked at the pix again, and a thought
occurred to me.  It doesn't really look like this bus 
is *trying* to be the old one, other than the name they
slapped on the poor beast.  It has nothing in common 
with the original, other than rubber tires.  At best
this thing is the successor the eurovan.
