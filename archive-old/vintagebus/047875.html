When you say save it, you do mean save it from being a hippie bus don't you? 
The poor guy looks like it has had to have gone around its whole life with 
that disgusting paint job on it. I actually remember reading about that bus 
in a old NEATO newsletter. That busses name should be sherman, and they ran 
the TN chapter of the best bus club in the whole world.
