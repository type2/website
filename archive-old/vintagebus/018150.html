Ij just got really intimate with my taillight wiring
on my 67. Maybe this will help:

The license plate light operates off a hot wire which
comes off the the passenger side taillight, then it's
grounded to the decklid. Mine was sketchy because the
decklid was grounded to the body via the hinges. When
I opened the declid the license light dimmed and
flickered. Loose hinges.

 but the troubleshoot should go in this order:
1) make sure the bulb is good.
2)do a current test on the end of the wire which comes
from the taillight where it attaches to the license
light.
3) clean with sandpaper the connections in the bulb
socket and the bulb itself.
4) check for proper grounding of the license housing
to the decklid and the decklid to the car.

This should do ya. Just think of the equation of power
wire to bulb, bulb to ground.


For checking the tail/brake/signals by yourself. I had
a spare window in my garage, and I angled it against
tha back wall so I could see the lights reflecting
perfectly from the cab. You could also back up  to
opposite your house's glass door, or put a mirror
close to the rear corner of the car.

Hope it helps.
Good luck
Jason
