Subject: Re: [VB] Are 67's supposed to have reverse lights??

I have a early '67 hard top Westy that is sans lights.

Coming home from the last OCTO a guy in a '67 camper had some really
cool amber clear lensed reverse lights.  He said they were two function
(two bulbs one for the clear and one for the turn).  They are identical
to bus reverse (in body) lights with the exception of the two bulbs and
colors.  He wired the clear side to the back up switch and paired the
amber side to the turns.  Very cool way to get higher amber turns.  

He said they came off of a Merc.  The conversation was at a red light
and through the windows so I didn't get which Merc. they came from.
