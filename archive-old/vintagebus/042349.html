Volks,

I am rebuilding the fuel pump for the '67 (I am rebuilding everything, but
right now let's limit the question ;-).  I took it apart, dumped the less
delicate bits in the cleaner bucket, sprayed the valve body with WD-40 and
wiped it down with paper towels (much less satisfactory, but I did not
want to risk the valve body), now I am looking for a rebuild kit.  Went to
wolfburg west and I think I need to buy two different kits to get the
parts I need.

a picture of the stripped down, partially cleaned pump is at:

The 40hp screw inlet kit 
(http://www.wolfsburgwest_dot_com/cgi-bin/wwshowpn.cgi?PN=111198553)
seems to contain the rocker and axle I need;  the 1200-1600 kit
(http://www.wolfsburgwest_dot_com/cgi-bin/wwshowpn.cgi?PN=111198555)
seems to contain the diaphram and gaskets I need.  *neither* contains a
filter screen :-(  I know I can buy a replacement fuel pump easily enough,
but I wanna keep it as original as I can.

Also, is this the right pump???  all the descriptions I see are implying
that I should have a pump with 2 push-on fitings, not the compression
inlet fitting and push-on exit.  Everythign on the engien looks original
as all get-out, but the difference between a 32 year old original and a 31
year old replacemnt is pretty slender :-)
