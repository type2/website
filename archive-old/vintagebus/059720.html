Subject: Re: [VB] Any Listees in NC?

Well your gonna have a hard time finding Greenville/Spartanburg NC, You sure
you don't mean South Carolina?? =)
Well I don't know much about the Vw scene in Spartanburg but you would be
only 1 1/2 hours south west of Charlotte. The club MVWE is located here and
things happen every so often. There are quite a few shows during season,and
campouts all year round, enough to keep you busy. When are you heading this
way?
