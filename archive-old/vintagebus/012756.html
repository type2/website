Ellis recognises flame bait when he sees it!

Vanbondo-esque response follows:
Just like Gibson's Oval I have never been garaged properly and don't get
serviced as often as I'd like. So it goes. In spite of all of the factors I
too appear to be well preserved inspite of myself. Rode hard and put away...
hot and dry because it is Arizona after all. There is always that fear of
bubble rust though. I have been accused of being strange, lucky and thick at
times. Superior? Um, it's south of Globe/Miami by several miles. (obscure
Arizona geography reference) Survivor? Hell yes, You have no idea... I could
tell stories that would curl your hair. ~but won't due to being in line to
become a Bishop within my Stake. ;-)
Let's can this thread until Friday.

Maybe I'm just imagining it, but it seems to me that the pre-60's VWs,
&gt;Mercedes, even french and english cars that survive today are not as
&gt;rusty as those made in the '60s, '70s and so on.  Maybe the steel back
&gt;then was less contaminated or more resistant to rusting?  I washed and
&gt;waxed the '56 Oval today and I'm still amazed after owning the Beetle
&gt;for over 5 years now how rust free it actually is.  It's really never
&gt;been properly garaged.  A friend's '56 bus seems the same.  Maybe these
&gt;survivors are just strange, lucky, or made of thicker and superior
&gt;steel?  I wonder if Ellis somehow feels that this better craftmanship is
&gt;somehow personally reflected in his millionth Beetle birth date?!
