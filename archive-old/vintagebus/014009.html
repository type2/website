Subject: [VB] pre `61 Bus outer drivers door handle NOS 4-SALE 
Message-ID: &lt;19991116055136.1458.rocketmail_at_web905.mail.yahoo_dot_com&gt;

I have 2 of these NOS bus drivers door outer handles. 
They are absolutely perfect...even for NOS.  They each
come with a pair of matched NOS large VW logo keys. 
These are part number 201-837-205.1 according to my VW
bus parts manual they are used up to chasis number 705
619, which is up thru early `61 production.  

$125 each shipped in the USA.

Thanks
