My dear old Dad used to say, &quot;Son, It's not the cost but the up-keep!&quot;
This goes for cheap vehicles, tools, firearms, unhealthy pets and bad
girlfriends/boyfriends/etc. Step up and get a good one and you can save
money in the long run or be patient until the right one comes along.

As an example of the exception, someone whom we know in a neighboring State
was lucky and snagged a near perfect 68 westy from the original owner for
$500.00. Waxed the bus, bought new tires, changed the fluids and performed a
total tune up and has been driving it without incident. I have rarely seen a
more perfect complete unrestored bus!

Good luck on your search,
