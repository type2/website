Subject: Re: door panels

Gene,

I am not sure how they would be posted or reproduced. 
(ANYONE??)  If someone had an idea how to do it I
would more then happy to share what i have.  Making
paper patterns are a Pain and storring them is not fun
either.  I will see what i can do.  Please be patient
though.

Matt

&gt; How's it going?  I would be interested in getting a
&gt; copy of the panels you referred to.  How would you
&gt; post something like that though?  It's too big to
&gt; print out and copy onto the new panel.
