Well,

I have been up to yesterday a bay window or bug driver.  So yesterday we 
took our 59 out that we just purchased(after taking the original tires off 
and got new Jupiters on there) for the first time.  Man, that thing echos 
when you drive it!  But its so neat.  You feel really close to the 
windshield, but also I feel like I am looking thru the world with bug eyes.  
that split down the middle sure is different.  I love it though.  It feels 
so old.  We still have to clean out the window track for the sliding windows 
between the front passenger and back cargo area.  I checked and these 
windows are stock.  But once we clean the track and can close the windows it 
will make it a little quieter and warmer when winter comes.  and a rug in 
the back will do for some coziness.

Pretty neat though.  I was all smiles.  We are selling our 75 beetle to make 
room for our new honey.  Anyone interested let me know.

This weekend we will be in the garage with sand paper and beer.  Hopefully 
next weekend will be close to painting it.  Original blue of course.  We are 
going to keep the inside grey but will paint the interior later.  We will 
take pictures and post on line the progress we make.

I haven't seen many on the list with a 59 except the one who posted recently 
with the SC or DC.  I'd love to hear from you all.  I'm curious what options 
a 59 has compared to lets say a 54?

Anyhow, Just happy to have drivin it.  It rides awesome for not having been 
a daily driver before.
