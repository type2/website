I found some info in the garage when cleaning up (that never happens). Anyway,
there are some pages including exploded views of a couple of models and a
trouble shooting page. I photocopied it about 15 years ago, so not complete.
One pic shows a cool double cab model.

If anyone needs this info I could scan it and email to them or copy and snail
mail.
