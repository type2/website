&lt;&lt; Hi list,
 
 I want to replace the irritating two nuts and a lock washer arrangement on
 my front stub axles with the later cleverer one piece thingy that locks with
 an allen key. I've been told that part no: 211 405 669 670 will do the trick
 for my '60 Dcab with the stock but squeaky front suspension.
 
 Anyone know if this is the case?
 
 TIA &gt;&gt;

if you have a 64-67 suspension you can use the one nut thang from a bay 
window bus, that has the allen head tightener, but the front spindle has a 
differnt size thread/diameter than the 63 and earlier style.

might as well buy a small pile of lock washers next time you get some, keep 
them in you bus bits box in your bus
