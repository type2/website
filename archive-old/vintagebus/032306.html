I agree with you there George. There's a guy in our club that used to give
me grief all the time about talking on my phone. But then I realized that
he's a trucker. So I asked him what's the difference? He stopped hassling
me! heheh

I know you've heard it before, but I almost feel I drive better when I'm on
the phone. Hands-free (on the phone) is little different than talking to
someone in the car with you and is generally less distracting.
