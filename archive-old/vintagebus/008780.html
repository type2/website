Subject: 6 volt battery

Ok, the at least 21 year old 6 volt battery in my 65 is finally dead.....
I'm having trouble finding any replacements....  But in case I do end up
with a choice is there any brands or types any one has good luck with?
Or does anyone have any leads on one....

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
