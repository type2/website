&lt;&lt;  Is this modification a &quot;must do?&quot; &gt;&gt;
Hi Mark,
Yes it is.  The old fashion in the shroud cooler preheats the cooling air 
going to number 3 &amp; 4 cylinders.  moving the cooler to the front of the 
fanhousing, and porting the air that has cooled the oil cooler out the front 
tin reduces the left hand cylinder temps.  Since number 3 cylinder already 
tends to loose it's exaust valve to stretching too much, and breaking off 
keeping it cooler will only help.  So unless you are planning to move to 
somewhere like Norway changing to at least the doghouse is a must.  Eric&amp;Barb
