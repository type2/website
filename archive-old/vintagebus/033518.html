My &quot;rice-rocket&quot; driving brother gave me some of the Dyno-Mat stuff he had 
left over. I put it under/behind the back seat and on the wheel wells of my 
'59 Kombi. It did tons for quieting it down. You don't have to totally 
cover an area either. You can cut it into smaller pieces and use it to stop 
vibration...which is your main source of noise in a bus. And most of that 
is from your trannsaxle. This stuff would be good on the inside of doors 
and walls too. But the main area to start is the &quot;hump&quot; area I talked about 
before. I have a hard time hearing my engine right now. I couldn't imagine 
it TOO much more quite.
