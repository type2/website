Subject: Re: [VB] wheel studs

Try the Porsche sources. Pelican parts or something like 
that. Probably pricy, but will last forever. 
My '63 DC is set up a lot like yours except I have a '68 
front beam, '72 disc brake spindles with Porsche cookie 
cutter wheels. I use the Porsche cap style nuts which 
seem too lightweight and flimsy, but they hold like 
crazy and haven't busted yet.

&gt; Hey List,
&gt; I'm running 5 spoke Empi wheels on my 63 double cab. I
&gt; have a 66 front beam and an IRS beetle tranny.
