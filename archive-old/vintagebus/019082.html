REgarding my wing window whistle.................

Was writ:
let me guess- your latches are broken, if so, fix
them.
I replaced the upright little piece in the frame that
the raear side of 
the 
vent wings seals against and it helped my bus
try pushiung the front corner of the vent wing while
driving if this makes the whistle go away,  you may
want to carefully bend the tab the vent latch 
latches to so as to get a snugger fit.  Just a bit,
and test for a whistles again.  BTDT.
--------------------------------------------------
First let me say thanks for all of the reply 's and
suggestions....
however, let me explain that the wing windows are in
perfect condition and the latches hold the windows
very tight, so tight that the whistle gets quieter as
I start to unlatch. The rubber is like new and seals
great! Still, the noise, the noise

Keep the suggestions coming..

Thanks
Chuck Notmeyer
