Subject: '59 Kombi...family trip to Sonic

Took the first little &quot;family&quot; ride in  the Kombi yesterday. Since 
the backseat is now installed, we took the bus to town for our 
&quot;Saturday routine&quot;.

The coolest thing was when we went to sonic for lunch. After I pulled 
up into the space, I realized the menu and speaker were farther back 
than usual because of the way the bus is set up. After I ordered I 
opened my driver window and realized it was gonna be a tight squeeze 
getting the food through the little window opening. As I'm thinking 
and enjoying the cool fresh breeze coming through the cracked safari 
window... the little light bulb in my head went off.

I opened the safari all the way up. As my wife is calling me a 
show-off, the manager comes out and is marveling at how cool it is 
that the window opens like that. All the little girls on roller 
skates also tell me how cool it is as they skate back and forth.

And so when the food comes, we exchange food and money quite easily 
through the open safari as all the other patrons are watching in 
amazement. After we're done I lower the window to the small crack it 
was before and my wife once again calls me a &quot;show-off&quot;.

Fun!!!!
