 Gee Clara,

   I think you should immediately rip those stupid things out of that poor bus.
Send them
   to where they will be severely dealt with for leaking all over your poor 61.
Send them
   way down South  OC way, where,( did I mention It'll be 80 today) I will put
them on
   my 65 Westy.  I will punish those bad bad things by driving around in the dry
air with
   them wide open.They'll never have a chance to leak down this way.  Bad Safari,

   bad...bad!

&gt; yesterday was incredible.    Dry even.  sunny, warm  must have been in the
&gt; sixties.  (And we like the sixties, right? )   hadn't felt that in a while.
&gt; So I have to mess with the safari bus, which has several names. 61 non sunroof
&gt; deluxe .    Haven't driven the thing much since summer, due to safaris being a
&gt; stupid idea and garbage and I can't drive in the rain with them so it has sat
&gt; under the carport most of the winter.
