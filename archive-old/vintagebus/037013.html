&lt;&lt; The straightest and most rust free 1960 bug I have seen in a while. &gt;&gt;

Hi Jason,
Good luck with the bug!  Make sure the plastic shade lenses in the tail 
lights are out of there.  They seem to only have been installed in N. 
American destined 1956-61 bugs and make the signals a lot harder to see!  
Plus to really mess things up VW put the reflector in the center of the lense 
just as they did for the 56-61 N. American bus tail lights.  So having a 
seperate pair of signal lights is a good idea since those following you will 
be obliterating thier view of your signals with the reflection of thier own 
halogen head lights reflecting back at them!  The steering column has a lot 
of two year (60 &amp;61) only parts and the main fuse box is a one year item made 
out of the spilt window part.  Also make sure the rear window and especially 
the front windshield have sealant in around the seals.  Otherwise the water 
gets around the front windshield and it's rubber and this leaks through the 
primer drains in the body frame on down into the heater sytem/channels and 
eventually onto the floor and rusting out all these areas.  Fortunitly the 
rear primer drains go directly into the engine air intake, but it still is 
not good to have water sitting under the seal.   
We hope you can find a nicer bus to add to the bug and once again see you on 
the vintagebus list.  Eric&amp;Barb
