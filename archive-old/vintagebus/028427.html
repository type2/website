ben....
    I haven't catalogued the little differences between the SP manifolds...
but I had to go out in the garage and look at the stash...
    211 129 701D
    113 129 701M
    113 129 701AA
    113 129 701 (C?... kind of blurred in the casting)... this last one has
what seems like a *miniscule* intake diameter where it would fit to the
cylinder heads... the flanges themselves are *fixed*, whereas on all of the
abovementioned manifolds, there is kind of a little flange-piecelet that will
move around some above the actual sealing flange...
    if anyone could shed some light on these... TIA... it wouldn't bother me
to part with one of them if it was one that would work in ben's case..
    if worse comes to worse... i heard it *here* that one could drill at spots
directly opposite eachother in the &quot;straightaway&quot; portion of the heat riser
tube (left to right, before the downward bends....) enabling one to insert
straight implements and utensils through the heat riser and thus clear the
blockage very easily. Then use a MIG welder to patch up the holes... simple
and effective.

&gt; Hello;
&gt; I'm wondering if anyone has an single-port Intake manifold with the part #
&gt; 113 129 701D. I've been told that this is a manifold for a '65 40hp. If
&gt; anyone has one of these I could use it (I'm worried that I might destroy
&gt; mine trying to clean out the preheat tube).
