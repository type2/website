Gas anaylsier in Maryland.

   was at the Maryland state surplus outlet in Jessup yesterday and they
had a full fleged Bear Exhaust Gas analyzer for $100, would have grabbed
it but it was too large for my avaliable space so if any FI folks need it
grab it quick.  (and then let me borrow it to check my engine)
