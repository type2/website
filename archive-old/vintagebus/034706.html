You need a bigger set up i have a brazing torch on big set up with a tiny tip 
i use to do pin holes with ,,Yes you can braze a bus ,,been there did that 
,week ago as a matter of fact. You cant do large holes with out warping but 
you can the small ones, it requires practice and some skill and alotta luck, 
there may be some pics of what i did on my web pages. It was on the donor
