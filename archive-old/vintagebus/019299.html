i remember that bentley had been putting a bunch of their manuals into pdf
format...I would imagine that this would make the production costs
cheaper...and therefore our costs less. I know that nothing beats a real book,
but for $100?

that way you could just browse what you wanted...print out what you
wanted...and always have a fresh copy available at your own printer.
