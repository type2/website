I had a sticky turn signal that I recently cleaned. I used electrical 
contact cleaner and a toothbrush- which worked well and made the contacts 
shine. I need the lists knowledge as far as what is the grease that was on 
there before keeping it lubed? Is the bosch distributer grease correct or 
dielectric grease possibly? TIA.
