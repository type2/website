Subject: License plate resto?
References: &lt;200001052051.MAA12935_at_lenti.type2_dot_com&gt;

I saw on the license plate thread that you can get them &quot;restored&quot; for about $100.00 for the pair.  Does
anyone know somebody in So. Cal that can do this?  Maybe for cheaper?  I have black and yellow plates on
my 65 and they are looking a little grungy.  Does any kind of special paint need to be used like on the
newer plates?
Thanks for the advice.
