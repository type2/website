&lt;&lt;The great thing about this list....if you're here long enough, is that
every once in a while, its deja vu all over again.  Again...and
again...and again.

I'm sure someone will answer your question directly, but you might try
looking in the archive...if its working.  This topic comes up about
every year or so.  :-)&gt;&gt;


Thanks for the suggestion.  I usually hit the archives first, but at the
moment, Juno is giving me email only.  My server number isn't hooking up
or something.

You're right about stuff coming up over and over.  There are only so many
things you can talk about, then you have to start over.  Ha ha.
