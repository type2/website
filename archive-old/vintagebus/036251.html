&lt;&lt; When I replaced the shoes on the left side there was virtually no brake
 dust...yeah, rebuild the MC. Thanks for listening. =^ )

Hi Ken,
Must agree with the others that you should check your flexable brake lines
first.  Then if they are working fine you would be prudent to dissassemble the
side that is not braking and check the wheel cylinders for corrosion.  Have
found all to often that the potmetal pistons will corrode and stick in thier
bores.  While the bores themselfs would be perfectly clean.  After removing,
sanding, cleaning, and inspecting, the pistons and bores they worked just
fine.     Eric &amp; Barb
