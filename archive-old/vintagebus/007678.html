as of the last year all my sachs clutch kits came with
the alignment tool, t/o clips and pilot bearing and for a while they were
all german parts, but thats history now.

but for a cheap clutch tool, moat vw shops have a surplus of tranny imput
shafts, that what i use, or get one from a junk trans, then it's free!!

the brazialian gas tanks are fair at the best, i sell them
for 75.00 dollars, but would rather find you an original
the metal is thin and the shape is a little different, but  they are cheap
and will get the job done if in a pinch. i will have some good tanks soon
as i am converting all my drivers to the bay tanks, need that 15 gallons of
gas

thanks to all those on the list that have offered and came through with
some of the parts for my 66 deluxe, still need the back seat back rest
4 side window jailbars and 2 ends, and the long deluxe trim for the drivers
side
(doug you must have some of this stuff for sale)

the deluxe is going in the shop friday and will see if i can get it running
can't wait to see if it does

another weird thing is the deluxe never had a passenger mirror!!!!!!
has the left arm, but never had a right
