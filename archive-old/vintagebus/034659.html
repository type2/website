I have bought from and sold to Stephen, No problems as of yet.
Anything sold to me AS-IS no refunds makes me kinda hesitant.
Actually, I sniped that auction, was kind of dissapointed I didn't win.
400$ for a NOS 36 case is dirt cheap!!!!!!!!!
I guess 400$ for a wasted 36 case isn't such a hot deal. =)
Thats pretty messed up if you don't get you're money back.
Please keep me and the list posted so I can watch out in my further dealings.
I have a few perfect used standard/standard blank unstamped 36 cases if 
you're interested. They would be priced along the lines of what the ebay one 
ended for.
Regards,
Greg

&lt;&lt;to all on the list i got scamed by this guy (mr.kdf)  i got a listed as nos

36hp case from him that he stated he did not know for sure if it was nos,

but it showed no signs of wear and had old flaking cosmilne on it.

not only is the case wasted in the thrust area but the rear main tore the

heck out of the line bore,   it is not evan usable, and the cosmoline was

fresh and wet,   i filed a report with ebay.   we will see where this goes.

my money back.    thanks john
