THERE WERE SOME TYPOS IN THE ORIGINAL POST - USE THIS ONE INSTEAD
===============================================================

This ones for Clara and the rest of you.

Due to my grandfather, I've found a wonderful way to fix them without you
having to buy new backing plates.

First off, when you look at the block that the adjusting stars go into, the
clip is supposed to run across the top of the block and put minor spring
pressure down on top of the adjusting stars to keep them from turning.
First with a little familiarization process with the area, we'll take you
down the road of spring clip recovery.

If you remove the adjusting stars, you'll notice that when they are
inserted, they don't touch in the middle of the block. There is usually an
1/8&quot; or 3/16&quot; gap or more in there. Looking at the top of the block, you
should see the remnants of the tack weld job that held the original clip in
place. Looking at either end of the block, (as well as across the top
of it) there is a slight groove that the spring clip sat in to keep
the rotating forces of the adjusting stars from tearing the clip off.

Here is how I fixed it.

I got some metal banding from a local lumber yard. This is the metal stuff
that you see on crates, pallets, etc. We throw it away by the fist-fulls.
(Some people use the spring found in an old wind-up clock.) You need abut
6&quot; to do a whole vehicle but extras can be had if you like to pack rat stuff
away for future use. What I did is measured the width of the gap on the
adjusting star block and measured how much spring clip I would need to span
the distance across the block out to the adjusting star tongs.

Next, I etched out the shape with an awl on the piece of spring steel
banding I had acquired. Before cutting out the shape of the clip from the
banding material, I drilled a hole in the exact center of what my final
piece would look like. Next I took a small grinder, and ground out the
little weld spot on the adjusting star block. This is a raised area that
can interfere with the installment of your new clip. Once it was ground and
clearanced, I marked the exact center of the block and drilled a hole down
until I got to the gap between the adjusting stars and stopped. No need to
drill any futher.

Now as far as determining what drill bit to use, I backwards engineered it.
I rarely pay attention to drill bit sizes. What I do is find a small bolt
that will fit in the adjusting star block and that will fit through the
banding material without mass compromise to the structural integrity of
either. You gotta make sure to use a bolt small enough that won't snap off
but at the same time, won't require removing all your banding material just
to get it through. I use an appropriate sized bit for drilling into the
adjusting star block
 &amp; then tap the hole. Using a step bit set, I grab the next bigger sized one
and drill the hole through the banding material. When I'm done, I bolt the
clip to the adjusting star block using a little loctite for security. I
prefer to bolt them on so if they break off in the future, I can bolt in a
new replacement. I would suppose welding would work as well if you wanted
to simplify things in the here and now.

The only thing left to do is put the little indentation in the clip so the
star won't turn. Easiest step of the whole process. Put your stars in and
let the flat part of the clip rest right on the valley of the adjusting
star. Using a dull chisel or screw driver, take a hammer and just dink the
metal down into the valley. It doesn't take much - just a light feminine
tap almost.

There ya go. As good as new and when the clip breaks off or rusts off, you
make a new one and bolt it in.
