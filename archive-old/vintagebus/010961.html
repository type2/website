&lt;&lt;  My question is 1) what
 coatings are available for mufflers and 2) how much should I put into this
 new coating?  Thanx for the advice.
  &gt;&gt;


ive used a product called VHT , can be found at good auto parts stores. It
comes in different colors, but as far as ive found, the &quot;cast iron&quot; flavor is
the best . it stays on incredibly. you have to blast the muffler first then
spray. mine has been going for a few months now and looks like new, unlike
that crap that burns off as soon as you start your engine....its a regular
spray can and goes for about $5 i think. good luck.
