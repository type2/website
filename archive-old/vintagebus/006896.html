Well it's done swapped out 1 trans installed a new one, swapped engines and
finished building and installing the new one. I think it's going to work,
1776 big valved single port, duel Kadrons, mated to a 3.88/77 4th big nut
trans, what pulling pwer, I was impressed and the engine isn't even broken
in yet, 55 mph in 3rd gear but pulls easily from 20 on up, 4th gear is way
out there, don't even think of putting it there till at least 40mph, but 3rd
isn't winging there either, temps seemed OK for the around town and short
highway run I did, we'll see on the long haul to Jerome with trailer in tow
and loaded to the gills with parts how it does on the trip there. Going to
make a 50 mile round trip highway run to see what she'll do tomorrow, I know
how it did up the hills and will be able to pretty much judge the
differences if any from the duel port, duel Kadron, 1.25 ratio rocker engine
with the late 66 trans to this new set-up, maybe I have finally found the
ultimate bus set-up, this is the 4th different combo I've tried and the most
different.
