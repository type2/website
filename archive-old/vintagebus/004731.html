Subject: How do you remove the ebrake cable?

Well this afternoon, I dove right in and started removing the rear drive
train of Daisy (you better get to know my 66 - she's named after my Great
Aunt who passed away a year and half ago). :-)  Anyway, I can't figure out
how to remove the ebrake cable.  Is there a clip holding the cable guide in
the backing plate?  It almost appears as if there are 2 machined lips on
either side of the backing plate that prevents removal of the line.  Thanks
for the help - back to work!
