Subject: new aluminum case problems?

------=_NextPart_84815C5ABAF209EF376268C8
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII


hi. i am considering buying one of those new 
aluminum cases in the not-so-distant future. i have spoken to a shop who has 
assembled a few already and they have told me of two problems, and i was 
wondering if anyone else had heard of these problems or has experienced them 
first-hand, or any other problems. (by the way, the guy who built the engines is 
no schlub, and has been building quality engines since he was factory trained in 
1963.)

problem 1: the webbing inside the case, on the half 
with the generator pedestal mount (right side), #2 main bearing webbing is not 
properly machined, thus not allowing the crank to properly turn, 
and when setting end play the crank rubs on this, not allowing proper end 
play setting. this was &quot;remedied&quot; by a simple grinding off of ecxess 
material.

problem 2: the face for the oil pump is machined 
too much (approx .040&quot;--forty thousandths) and when tightening the oil pump, it 
causes the pump to bind up/crank+cam bind. i didn't get enough info to find out 
what they did to remedy this, but the builder assured me it was a modification 
to the oil pump, and not to the case to fix this.

he had also mentioned that one of the cases was not 
bored right (not proper bearing-to-crank clearance--too tight and crank bound up 
uopn tightening the 6 &quot;big&quot; case half studs), and to fix it, they had to line 
bore it to 20! this was only one case (so far), but if so far each case has had 
a problem or more for them, what's the deal?

so, if anyone else has had these problems, i'd like 
to hear about it, or any others. and for those who have bought them, maybe you 
should check these areas just to be sure.

thanks,

jon
