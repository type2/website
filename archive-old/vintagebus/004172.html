Tonight I garnered the help and support of my infamous sister Kerry to help
me work on the old 1967 bus.  She sat up front and turned the key on command
while I pumped the throttle, cussed a few times under my breath, and
generally continued to get just as frustrated as my battery was letting me
know.

Now I will tell you right now that those of you who do stupid things while
working on your VWs are not alone.  If you are a newbie, you're justified,
and if you are experienced, your friends no longer laugh but look at you
with shifty eyes.  The fact of the matter is that we all make mistakes and
in this instance, I've done one of the stupidest things I've ever done on a
VW.  With my 7 years of list presense and tons of tips and advice being
passed my way, you would have thought I would know better but I simply
forgot because of it being late and me being tired.  Please don't feel bad
if you screw up because I sure did.

I left the vise-grips on the fuel line.

And so the thought hit me after I disconnected the fuel line from the pump
and saw no fuel and couldn't blow through the line.  The bad part was that
the line leaked and trickled on me all night despite me using a pencil &amp;
vice-grips to clamp of the fuel flow.  I even used a bigger diameter pencil
and it still dripped.  Nevertheless, I thought I had removed the grips and I
hadn't.

With Kerry's help, the filter showed fuel was running wild and free along
the black tunnel confines and the engine came to life.  I dropped my timing
light the other day and it no longer works so I'm about ready to slither out
to Walmart and pickup another cheapy so I can set the timing dead on.  I
threw all the tools in the back of the bus and we went for a spin around the
neighborhood.  Wow!  That engine is so smooth and quiet (except from the
rampant popping which I still can't tell for sure where it is but I think
it's the header to heaterbox connection.  There is no head snapping jack
rabbit tire squealing starts but the power is there, it's smooth, and unlike
the 1600 that once lived in my engine bay, there isn't that oscillating
engine rpm fluctuation after you hit a dip or rough spot in the road.  You
put the pedal clear down and in no time you have to get out of first gear.
I made it to 3rd and couldn't believe how much faster it all was.

And even though this seems like the end of a saga (in a way it is - my first
engine rebuild was a high-po one and I've just used it to power my arse
around), it's actually just the beginning of many happy journeys.

I've taken this engine problem as an omen and I've decided that instead of
risking my earnings on the possibility of tow trucks and a missed VW weekend
in Colorado, I've rented a Chevy from Enterprise for 4 days, unlimited
mileage for $139.99 - not bad at all.  Since we had car problems last year
and my sister missed the trip, I decided this would darn near guarantee the
trip will go over without a hitch.  Also, it just so happens Kerry is
unemployed this time around so she's ready to go road tripping!  This way I
can just sit back, relax, clear my head, and redirect my efforts towards the
BBNNTA event on Labor Day.

Even though I won't be driving a VW to the show, I'll still be in overalls,
bandana, Sony Mavica slung around my neck, and big as ever so I won't be
hard to miss.  You might even catch a glimpse of or be able to meet Kerry as
well. :-)
