&gt; On I-82 last week-end I saw a blue double cab headed west with a big, orange
&gt; farm tractor triangle sign on the tailgate.  Not such a bad idea.  It's
&gt; portable and can be stored during daylight hours.  I may get one myself.  Is it
&gt; legal?

Technically, no.  Buses are too fast to be considered a &quot;slow moving
vehicle&quot; in any state that I know of.  I've never heard of anyone being
hassled about it, though.

OTOH, you can make a &quot;slow moving vehicle&quot; triangle in any other color and
be perfectly legal.
