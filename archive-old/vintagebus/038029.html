&lt;&lt; I think they saved money by not buying a house, 911,  having a '54 deluxe 
at a pro
 restoration shop, and doing back to back '55 and '60 full restos...wink wink 
:-).
 We all have our priorities no?  I have a house and 3 busses....I don't 
travel much
 either.  Working and eating....its a good thing!
  &gt;&gt;
I think that could be it, The only big ticket items (over $150) I own is my 
buses, the tools to work on them with, a serger and just recently a washer.. 
I save money on rent by living in a house with holes in the floor.  I also 
only work 2 days a week (36 hours) so if I plan it right I can really stretch 
those vacations.
