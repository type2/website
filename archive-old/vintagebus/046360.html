&lt;&lt; when replacing this seal what should i be aware of...ronnie said he would 
send all the seals i could use, i guess there are a couple different types 
depending on the oil cooler. So do i just use the one that seems to match the 
connection best? &gt;&gt;
Hi Kevin,
Yes!  Just be sure to check the size of the hole and surrounding depressions 
on the base of the cooler and the size of the counter bores for the seals in 
the engine case.  Only used the copper plated shim washers that come with the 
tapered seals between the cooler and case when installing a small holed early 
cooler on a DR engine case with the larger counter bored holes for the seals.
 
 I have never taken the fan shroud apart...to see the oil cooler. My plan of 
attack
 1) remove engine
 2)remove fan shroud
 3)remove oil cooler
 4)clean up area/wipe down
 5)install new seals
 6)reattach oil cooler
 7)fan shroud replacement then engine&gt;&gt;
First dissconnect the thermostatic bellows from the flaps rod while the 
engine is still in the VW is the easiest way of doing this.  Unless you plan 
on putting the engine on a engine stand!
While you are in there you might install the thermostatic flaps and bellow if 
you do not have one, to keep your engine up to proper temp during the cooler 
weather coming soon.  Would also be a good idea and bite the bullet and 
install a compleat doghouse cooling system!
 
&lt;&lt;when replaing the oil cooler, how much should i torque the nuts?&gt;&gt;
0.8 MKG (6 Ft. Lbs.).
 
 &lt;&gt;
No do not!  Just check all surfaces for scratches or nicks for you to polish. 
 Any cracks will have to be dealt with or a new part found.  Lightly oiling 
seals before installation actually allows them to squish down properly with 
less chance to tear.
 
&lt;&gt;
Yes/no.  You have to remove the generator/alternator as one piece from the 
generator stand (Loosen and slide forward the hose kind of clamp around it 
locking it to the gen stand.).
 
 &lt;&lt;what should i be aware of while doing this whole operation?  &gt;&gt;
Yes, have your Bentley for your year engine handy, and read often.  Better 
yet to read quickly through the section you are going to do first and then 
still stop and reread each section as you get to it on the engine.
