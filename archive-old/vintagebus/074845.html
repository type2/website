Subject: Double Cab question?

Greetings All,

Been working on my rusty 62 Doublecab
project over the weekend.

A question.  Do DC's have an inner rocker strengthener 
(between outer sill and inner rocker panel)
under the passengers side door?

This is the first DC I've worked on and there
was no rocker left here to provide clues.

I'm guessing not given the 'short' span but
I'm not sure...
