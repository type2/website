Generally the stop can be placed on either end of the carb, not necessarily
the linkage side. I have set up a lot of Delorto and Weber carbs on numerous
different on and off road engines and have seen and used the stops on either
end of the carb. In my opinion these are critical as I wouldn't rely on
anybody's linkage to keep the carbs in sync at idle. The procedure I use is
to disconnect the linkage from one carb, sync them, then reinstall and
adjust the linkage accordingly. One thing to remember is placement of the
linkage levers on the cross bar, you need to make sure they are in the right
position to make sure both carbs are opening equally and all the way. I have
had many an engine in the shop were the linkage was set up wrong for WOT and
only one carb was opening all the way and the other 3/4, doesn't make for
very smooth running.

ps. I just saw that you were using Berg linkage, remember it bolts to the
shroud and they can have movement in them, critical that your shroud is
mounted solid.

all comments are from my own experience and of my own opinion

Does anyone know if I need idle stops for these carbs?  I've got the Berg
linkage and initially was planning to rely on the linkage to set the idle
but I'm afraid that time and wear will make this all but unreliable
eventually and I'll end up wearing a groove in the venturi from the
butterfly hitting it.

A call to Fast Freddy's said that for $20, I could be sent a couple of
levers for THEIR linkage that have the idle stops but this won't work with
the Berg linkage I would assume.  From pictures in various publications,
I've seen a fancy lever with a spring loaded type of stop and even a few
setups that aren't running the idle stops at all.  The problem with making
your own is that the idle stop lever will hit the linkage UNLESS you use a
spring loaded type of deal where you dial the idle lever in but it doesn't
swivel with the throttle at all.  It merely acts as a physical stop for the
throttle lever (if that makes any sense.)

Anyone got any ideas to help me out?
