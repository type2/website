FWIW, I think the key words here is &quot;unknown mechanical condition&quot;  I myself 
would prefer not to drive such a beast, especially with the lack of ease of 
parts for some bits, without checking mechanical condition, generally 
changing the oil/gear oil/repack wheel bearings/ brakes?/ new front 
shocks?/good tires?/ tune up. type of thing.  This said, I have more than 
once gone to a bus that sat for decades, and camped out for a couple of days 
and did such a thing and ended up driving 2 buses home. 

even towing (unless on trailer) your should change the gear oil. check boots/ 
 check/repack F wheel bearings and grease suspension.     


also- a full crash box tranny has no synchros.   My 53 and also Ellis' 54 
(and I believe Everett's 54 too, unless someone retrofitted the older style) 
have synchros  in some gears- but not first or reverse.  until about 6,000 
buses before mine- it was in early 54- there were no synchros at all in the 
tranny-none.  which is why they called them crashbox.  the later splitcase 
trannys are not crashbox, they are partially synchronised.

 Hey Jerry,
 Let me know and we can take my &quot;worthless&quot; '54 6v 36hp
 full crashbox (1st and reverse) tranny and tow it home
 with it's Brink brand assy hitch if your bus breaks
 down =) The '54 made it to the Classic and back two
 years running. I found this year that a trailer was
 mostly an inconvenience.
 We could pop the RAF barn era safaris and enjoy those
 killer hills.
