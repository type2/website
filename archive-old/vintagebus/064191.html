Subject: Nose skin neede for a '60 in IL

I'm not in a hurry...it's not like I need it today. The Bus is in fine condition overall but
eventually I'd like to replace &quot;bondo nose&quot;. Driver door would be nice too. If anyone knows of any
donors in the Chitown area I would appreciate a little note.

Thank you.
