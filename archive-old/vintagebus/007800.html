Subject: Trailer out of a bus?

I had a wonderful idea tonight on how to beat a junk car ordinance.  :-)  I
drew a quick sketch of my idea and it looks feasible.  You know how guys
take pickup boxes and turn them into trailers?  Well why can't you do the
same thing with a bus and call it a trailer?  I'm not talking about cutting
it in half though - why not take a bus, remove the front axle and
engine/tranny and then make up a tandem axle trailer with twin I-Beams or
C-Channel.  Then you would weld 2 vertical plates on this framework.  The
rearward plate would have 2 holes that would bolt into the tranny horns and
the front plate would have 4 holes that would line up with the axle beam
mounts.  You would set the bus in the frame work and bolt it in and voila -
you've got an enclosed trailer. :-)  If you wanted to get fancy, you would
hinge those plates so either the front or rear of the bus could be unbolted
but swiveled and hinged upwards so you could 'work' under the box of your
trailer while the main frame and wheels touched the ground.  This would
allow you to store a vehicle on your property but registered as a trailer.
You could rebuild all the mechanicals off of the vehicle and then later on,
bolt them back on the bus (the &quot;box&quot;).  Just for fun, you could redo the
upholstory and other things in your &quot;trailer box.&quot; :-)
