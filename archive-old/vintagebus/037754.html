 so what's it worth
 6/8/99             7:36 PM
I am getting ready to part out a couple of busses that are past restoration.  How is a person to know what a fair market price of an item  is, for either ebay or swap meet?  Is there a guide out there that says a door handel for a 59 single cab should be $50?

thanks for you imput
