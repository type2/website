 All I can say is what a GREAT SHOW. Small enough to meet everyone and big
enough to not get bored. There is really no way to describe the mass balloon
accents every morning, pictures dont even come close. 864 balloons taking
off within 30 mins is an increadable sight. Met all the N.M. people that I
had talked to before and nice to meet people face to face. Was disapointed
in the Az turnout. The N.M. bus folks support all the Az. events and it
would have been very nice to pay them back with our support at there one
show a year. Did have the chance to see Mikes 1951 Kombi that he got out of
a field in N.M. Chassis # 14,381 I think, very early bus, and he has it
running great. Went to the Bus Co Op that JP and Barry have. More early
buses packed into one area then I have ever seen. 3 1959 flip top westys and
1 even had the flip front seat also. Panels,deluxes,kombis,poptop westys,
and parts, parts, parts everywhere. 2 ot the fliptops were found within 1
mile of each other and they were build 1 day apart, how weird is that? Got
my walkthru pass seat and a great black s/w frome them. Great guys who will
be at BBB IV if you want to meet them. Also stopped by Ed's Bus Barn on the
way back and checked out his neat stuff. Ed has a 67 westy poptop for sale
that hopefully Cory in Havasu is buying( he needs to sell his 69 westy
first, who needs a great bubble westy out there?) A guy in Hollbrook Az. has
a 1959 or 60 fliptop westy rolling shell for sale, wants $600.00 for it.
Some rust and no interior at all. Have his phone number if you are
interested. Great trip back throught the forests of AZ. Found some leads on
some buses and parts, met some great people and finally beat Ronnie on the
hills and flats with the new motor. Great trip and will be going back next
year for sure.
