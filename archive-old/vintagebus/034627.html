Subject: Re:  [VB] Interior Panels - How do I keep them flat?
To: George.G.Rector_at_census_dot_gov, vintagebus-digest_at_lenti.type2_dot_com

For the door panels I line the doors with plastic, tuck the bottmom of the 
plastic into the doors before installing the panels.   For the other panels 
there is not much I know to be done to keep them from warping, other than 
keep your heat working  (to keep the VW dry)   The cab panels I made and 
installed a couple years ago n my 65 wetsy have not warped, inspite of being 
in damp w wa.   (yes it is the damp)   I do usually park it under the 
carport, though.  Yes usually the stock roof panels warp.   Dunno how long it 
takes.  I did put a couple layers of the shiny space insulation bubble wrap 
stuff there, that may help get rid of condensation on the panel compared to 
the fibreglas.   It did make it warmer at least!!!!!!


...........
Now that the cooler weather has arrived here in Michigan, I've decided to 
tackle
some long neglected projects on the interior of my '58 single cab.  I've made
some nice kick panels and door panels from hardboard from the Home Depot, and 
at
the same time I'm reconditioning and repainting the doors.  The door panels
looked like they had never been removed, and still had the 42 year old waxed
paper stuff on the inside.

The roof panels still look good, so I've decided not to make new ones.  But 
the
longest piece, the one hat goes from the top of one door over the top of the
other, is warped.  I've been reading the archives and I think I can get it
flattened out again, but I'm wondering if anyone has been able to figure out a
way to keep it from warping/sagging again?   (Is it heat or humidity (or both)
that cause it to sag?)  Someone mentioned applying POR-15 to the back side.
What about gluing it to the metal roof somehow?  I bought some Evercoat (?) 
self
adhesive sound deadening material that I plan to apply to the roof before I 
put
the panel back .... maybe I could somehow glue it to that.

Any suggestions?
