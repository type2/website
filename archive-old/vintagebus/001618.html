I have been attempting to get my new engine started and have had no luck at
all.  At this stage I didn't think that luck was needed.  I have owned 4
previous VW's and have worked with tired out engines and gotten them to run.
This time is different and I must say it has humbled me.  I have checked the
valves, checked the timing, just purchased a rebuilt carb, and have even
poured a small amount of gas down the mouth.  Not even a puff.  One thing
strikes me as odd.  The distributor is not sitting in the position that I
have typically seen.  When at #1 TDC, the rotor is pointing towards the fuel
pump, therefore, to have the dissy timed right, it has to be turned forward
as such.  This leaves the condenser in eye sight right above the oil
pressure gauge.  This seems wrong as it is typically out of sight and
towards the back side of the dissy.  I have tried two different coils to
make sure that this could be discounted.  A very humbling experience indeed.
Any comments or suggestions are welcome.  Thanks.
