Hi everyone,
I've been relatively quite on this list for some time. But I read a post that 
was looking for a meeting place at Sac.
I'll be in the swap area early in the morning if anyone wants to stop by and 
say hi.
I'll have the big green ch*vy towing my 54 sunroof bug that is for sale and a 
truck full of parts
Can't miss it, there should also be a big canopy set up to cover the parts 
and me from that awful Sac sun and dust

See you there
Dave Barnes
