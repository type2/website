Steve- ( and all )-
We need to read these posts more carefully.
The compression test results were included in the original post.
( And they are higher than your reasonable estimate ! ).
I failed to note that myself.

&gt; Check the compression in all 4 cylinders. If you have 110-120 psi in all
4,
&gt; put clean plugs in and drive it for 15 - 20 minutes. Pull the plugs and
&gt; check them. All should be light brown if the cylinder is firing right.
