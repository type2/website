&gt;&gt;You will have one more wire from the switch to the far right fuse in the 
&gt;&gt;fuse box - it should also have an inline fuse holder with an 8 amp fuse.
&gt;
&gt;Are you saying that there are 2 fuses on this circuit or that the feed
&gt;from the fuse block is on the non fused side?

The feed is unfused, yes.  Also, I didn't look closely at the diagrams -
the scanned German directions show it as being connected to the non-fused,
always-hot feed at the ignition switch (circuit 30, red wire) and the
Bentley scan for '63-'65 Buses show it as being connected to the non-fused,
always-hot feed at the headlight switch (circuit 30, red wire).  In both
places, the feed wire to the fans has an inline fuse immediately after
this connection.  You can connect to the same circuit at the far right
fuse, as long as you use the end with two red wires (circuit 30).  This
way, the current for the fans just goes through the inline fuse and not
through the far right fuse as well.

For '66 and '67, when the far right fuse went to 16 amps, Bentley shows
the ambulance fans as being connected directly to the &quot;downstream&quot; side
of that far right fuse.  In this case there is no in-line fuse and the
fans and wiring are protected by the far right fuse.

Unless I was shooting for complete accuracy, the way I would wire it
would be to use the inline holder with an 8 amp fuse in the feed to
the fans, and connect it to the unfused feed at the far right fuse.
The 8 amp fuse protects the fans and their wiring; connecting to the
feed at the far right fuse will avoid a little bit of voltage drop.
