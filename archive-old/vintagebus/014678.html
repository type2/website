Not only that, but it would take a matter of minutes to hook it up and
find out.  I wonder if radio sellers aren't deliberately ambiguous about
this - somehow a radio that &quot;might&quot; work is worth more than one that
flat-out doesn't.

&gt; &lt;&lt;This radio is in excellent condition and is a rare find. &gt;&gt;
&gt; Hi Mike,
&gt; Actually this model is one of the easiest to find though what you have looks 
&gt; to be in great condition.  Used between 1955-60 in the bus.
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;&lt;There is no guarantees on the working condition of the radio, but I believe 
&gt; that it operates just fine. &gt;&gt;
&gt; Oh please!  Unless you are some kind of electronic faith healer, just state 
&gt; that you do not know!  Foil type Condensors unlaminate and many other parts 
&gt; can and will go bad due to age/corrosion.  Plus this is a tube type radio, 
&gt; which tubes are well known to go bad at any time.  Even with the later 
&gt; Sapphire radios from the 1960s being all transistor if you by good condition 
&gt; used, but unknown radios of this type you are lucky to get a working one out 
&gt; of buying ten.
