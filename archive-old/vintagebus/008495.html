Yep, it was a great experience....the most notable bits were the meeting of
all the listees, and the successful driving of that there '66 Westy that
I've been playing with for the past 9 months.

The only &quot;trouble&quot; was a generator light that flashed on for a few seconds
after finally making it through the traffic Friday eve.  The light came on,
I switched off ignition, and on flashers as I coasted to a stop...before I
stopped, two busses were pulling in behind me on 101...Roger and Clara to
the rescue! Cool! So I checked everything, started back up, and red light
didn't come back.  Got to see their busses pulling back onto the freeway
simultaneously...real neat vibe!

At that cold, wet, but friendly Red Barn lot, Michele and I got to meet lots
of fun fine folk...some I don't know yet, some I've met before, and of
course, there are those on the list.  Ronnie, JP, J. Howard, Clara, Sam,
Rachel, Roger, Steve...the &quot;list&quot; goes on....I must say now that I enjoyed
meeting you all, and really look forward to bussing with you again...

Very cool show, and amazing swap....I'm going to have to start a fund so I
don't have to be so choosy!

Wonderful caravan and campout later on Saturday at New Brighton....big warm
fire, and turkey goo (you don't even want to know), and I was woozy with
wine, exhaustion, and the fact that the talk had turned to outer space
aliens....time for bed at midnight or so...up at 5:00 a.m. to blast over the
hills to Kelley Park.....next time I go, I say &quot;swap&quot; and be a part of it
all.  As it was, I had to seek out a driver's front door latch
mechanism...mine was not closing, and when it finally did, it would not
lock.  So I finally found something, and here's where I prove that I'm
green....I bought an NOS (my first NOS part, BTW) 64-66 rear hatch latch
mechanism for $30, and didn't realize this until I went back out to my bus
to fix it, and....whoops!  Oh well, it's one hell of a spare that I've got
there!  (Still gooey with cosmoline!).  Anyway, turned out that the spring
at the bottom of my latch that pushes the pawl up into the teeth was broken,
and after searching the whole swap area, I ended up replacing it with the
spring from a bug door jamb switch.  It's stronger than it should be, so
I'll find the right bit soon...

Michele and I zoomed home (well, 60 mph) and here we are, sore, tired,
stoked.....thanks to everybody, and hello....see ya later, and happy to have
finally met you!

(After I can focus again, mebbe I'll put up a few of my pics....)
