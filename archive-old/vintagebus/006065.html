Subject: OKC this weekend.

Going to OKC from Chicago this weekend. I'm leaving early Saturday morning,
staying in Springfield, MO. overnight and then heading to OKC in the
morning. Pickup bus drive to St. Louis , sleep, drive home early Monday. I'm
doing it this way since I'm taking my family with. Wife and two kids on the
road. It's gonna be fun. I don't want to kill myself driving 800 miles each
way non-stop. I've done it before, never again. Anybody on the way want to
wave or say hello? drop me a line!

Thanks to everybody that supported me and kind of pushed me to make this
trip. There was time when my car was stolen when I didn't want to do
anything. Small chat, a few warm e-mails make a difference.
Thanks,

Andre
