I towed my 67 from Ct to Fl.  The tinkertoy was packed full of camping
gear and pets.  Total weight well over 3000 lbs.  My towing vehicle was
a F&amp;#d Bronco 2, weighs less than that.  Didn't drone down I95 either. 
Went through the Smokies, Blue Ride parkway, and numerous other mucho
windy hilly roads.  There were many times I had to send my s.o. out to
get the prybar to pry the seat out of my butt. It's possible to tow with
a lighter vehicle but I certainly don't recommend it.  By the time
you're done screwing around, you're better off renting a trailer and a
decent size truck to tow it with.

Dave
