Subject: Re: [VB] cargo hatch hinge


[...]

&gt; The '67 has a broken rear cargo hatch hinge. I need to track down a
&gt; replacement, does anyone know what years of busses this same part is
&gt; used on? Or a repop source?

No repros that I have found.
The right torsion spring broke on my 67. 64 to 67 will work. Maybe 68 to 70 will
also but I have not checked, since the rear seal is the same.
I wrote a couple of times to the list asking if anyone had changed one.....this
was about a year ago. Not sure if anyone has....
Luckily my 67 is a EZ Camper with wood panels in the roof. If you have a bus
with the vinyl headliner, it will have to come down in the rear.
The hinge is in 2 pieces. The piece that bolts to the hatch is held to the 2nd
piece by 2 pins with clips that are a PITA to R &amp; R.
The 2nd piece has the torsion spring looping thru it. To replace that, the
spring has to come out. It hooks into the roof on the other side.
Major PITA retensioning the spring and getting it back in place! I had to
replace the spring and both pieces of the 'hinge'. I got them from a 66.
