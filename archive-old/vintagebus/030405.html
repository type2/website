Hello..
          Yes the ambulance was that way as well as the 54
micro(standard) that I had,the deluxe is not and the reason,I believe is
because it is a real late 54(Dec.) and I think they were out of rhd's by
then and were already tooling up for the &quot;new Dash&quot;almost all Barndoor's
from Sweden were lhd w/ doors on the left.The reason I have been told is
at that time in sweden it was rhd country,meaning they drove on the left
side of the street not the right....so they wanted the passengers to be
able to get out on correct side of the street and NOT into On coming
traffic..Personally I think it sucks,I rode to bad camberg and back in
95' in Ritchie king's very nice 54 and it is a rhd and the door set up
is all screwed,it's very hard to close the door when your sitting in the
middle seat  and then you have to worry about getting the &quot;right&quot; middle
seat,Flipper on the left.......GOOD LUCK!

Mark
