&gt; So we're up to 3 motors destroyed over the weekend?  Perhaps the real motive
&gt; behind hosting shows out in BFE arizona is to generate parts business.  Like
&gt; to giving a product away for free, then haing a 900 number for support...

Well, considering that the number of vehicles in attendence was around
200, and the number of miles driven was, say 500 each, the total mileage
was 100K miles.  Three failures in 100K miles is a bit high, but almost
every vehicle there was more than 30 years old.

I thing that we can pretty much eliminate evil intent!  :)
