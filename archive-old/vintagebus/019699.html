Subject: Campmobile vs. Riviera

Oh boy, I sometimes wonder why I get so into figuring out exactly what I 
own.  For about a year now, I've been pretty certain I own a Riviera 
camper.  The year of my bus (63) and its delivery port didn't match what I 
knew about Rivieras (northwest built after 65), but I figured someone drove 
it west and had it converted.  I have seen lots of Rivieras over the past 
year and they are built with so many different parts for different years!  
I have seen at least one other whose interior design mostly matches my own 
(roof panels, rear closet, etc)...I figured I had proof that I own a 
Riviera.

Recently enter a '58 &quot;Campmobile&quot; found in Arkansas with the tell-tale 
picture window and an interior that mostly matches mine in all the 
important places.  Does anyone have *any* information about the Campmobile 
line?  Where they were based at the very least?  I mean, I love my camper 
and that's what matters first and foremost, but I'd at least like to tell 
people about what I have and be accurate about it.

Any thoughts?
