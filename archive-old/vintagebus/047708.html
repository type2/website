Subject: Re:  [VB] One more heater box question
To: mroberds_at_worldnet.att_dot_net, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

They changed the size of the heat tube in 64 early 65?   You can use duct 
tape for a quick fix.   Ve sod adaptors which let you use the one size box on 
the other size bus, but they were just adptors from one to another, no big 
deal.  You ca sort that out with the motor installed.   Maybe the RMMW  bit 
is the way to go, though I haven't seen their product.   I once had a motor 
with smaller heater boxes in my bug (buildt new motor for bus, put tired 
motor in bug, which suddenly felt stronger) with larger heat tubes for a 
couple years, and used duct tape.

While comparing my new and old heater boxes today I noticed that the
new ones have larger warm air outlets on the front.  The metal tubes
I have to connect the heater boxes to the body won't fit over these
new, larger outlets.  (They fit the tubes on the body just fine,
though).  Bentley's mentions the change and an adapter ring, and
RMMW sells &quot;60mm to 50mm&quot; heater box-body hoses.  Will these hoses
do the job, or is there some other slick way to adapt the bigger
heater boxes to the smaller hoses?  Is the adapter that the Bentley's
mentions still available anywhere?
