Subject: two buses
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

So, is this the Friday post subject of &quot;How many
buses?&quot;

If so, then I have to say two.

both are in my driveway.

DARTHVW (67 21 window)
and Tiny-E (69 Westy)

Not too exciting comapared to the &quot;one person VW show&quot;
quantities posted earlier, but not too shabby
considering.  

But I must say that down the street there very well
might be a person this very minute typing in a &quot;How
many BMW's&quot; entry on their computer on some other
thread on some other list, but I'm very proud to be
slowin' traffic down in my neighborhood with my metal
behemoths.

And as those cell-phone toting West-siders lay on the
horn and blow their sighs with rolled eyes at me as
they pass me on the left, I can just give them the
spliff salute and offer them wishes of patience. 
It was about 80 degrees today and the lack of a
sunroof skin on DARTH concerns me zero percent. As
long as the engine keeps running and I can take seven
of my favorite work buddies out for hogies overlooking
the sands of the Pacific, I'm not doing too badly.

Thankful for sun and for buses,

Jason
