Subject: Re: [VB] Clutch wing-nut won't move

&gt; I should have did this when I had my engine out...but I'm green in that
area.
&gt;
&gt; I've got about too much play in my clutch pedal. I can't get the wing
&gt; nut to turn by hand and I can hardly fit any tools up in that area.
&gt; Any suggestions?

Take a big screwdriver and wedge it between the clutch shaft and the bell
housing on the trans. Pull back on the screwdriver handle to effectively
dis-engage the clutch until you have enough slack in the clutch cable to
loosen the wing nut.
