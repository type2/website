For all of your oddball wheel needs
(sounds like a commercial huh!) contact
http://www.stocktonwheel_dot_com/

They do all sorts of custom things with wheels.
They can even make a stock style wheel for my
one-year-only '64 Ford truck, for a very 
reasonable $65.  Coker has one for $70, special
order only, not returnable, and to one width 
only.

A word of caution, old rims designed for bias ply 
tires were not designed for the different loads
applied by a radial tire.  Although the tire may
fit, it may split after a couple of years.  
have had a couple of tire pros tell me this.
Just use a little caution here.

Their website specifically talks about widening
your rims to your specs.  Great to talk to over
the phone too.

On to rack supports -
Now I gonna let you all in on a little secret.
If you are diligent and check out thrift stores
and yard sales, you can still find the racks and
more importantly the supports for the Quik-n-Easy
style racks.

Cast aluminum with a wide base and a cam lock
tightening gizzy turning 90 degrees into a 
support with a hole for attaching whatever.
I know they work on a bus for I had them on my
'64 20 years ago for kayaking.  Sheeesh, what
a dummy, kept the rack sold the bus!  Shoulda
done it the other way around!  You can find
a padlock that hooks around the cam gizzy too,
to keep them on your bus.

They had some cool acccessories such as a hand
crank for loading boats, cradles for kayaks,
and other stuff.  Keep an eye out for them, and
when you've dried up the supply, maybe mine
will appear on Ebay &amp; I can retire on them!

They would work great for a homemade conduit 
based rack.  If I get ambitious, I'll get one to
Thom to image to put on his webpage.

Jeff  bussless, but still dreaming of them

Had to crawl under a T*y*t* Previa van over
the weekend to replace the starter, very much
like a VW starter job, but with more bolts.
