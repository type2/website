Hey ya list

I just got some very, very nice pics from Guido van Zundert from NL I
believe of a bus he bought in Sweden - very cool pics with a windmill in the
background - the bus is a 61 mango/mowengrau (I assume that's seagull grey).
These pics seem to be some of the coolest I've seen (but them I'm partial to
mango ;)).

I also have a couple of pics of Cuban buses that I took in Cuba in January,
and 1 of a newish splitwindow single cab that I took in mexico in april -
that's right, I would guess it is a commerical splitwindow single cab from
the 80's or 90's.

As soon as I get permission from Guido and I find a place to post em - I
will.
