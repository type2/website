Subject: Off-topic but hilarious

I apologize profusely, in advance, to those who have already seen enough
mention of our current national emergency on this mailing list in the
past month.  But a good laugh is hard to come by these days, and this
true story is just too funny to pass up:

Bus content:  I rebuilt and reinstalled the original fuel pump on my '67
DC last weekend, and put the replacement Brosol pump back in its box for
a spare.  I also replaced the section of metal fuel line going into the
pump, and added a new gasket where it goes through the bulkhead.  Then
the engine wouldn't fire up!  My wife gives me looks that say 'why did
you have to fix something that wasn't broken?'  So I took the old pump
off, took it apart, and re-checked all my work.  Finally a 4-watt light
bulb went on over my head.  I took of the top of the pump and filled it
with gas.  Two minutes and a few cranks later, it's back to purring like
a tiger.  Idiot!  I forgot to prime the pump!
