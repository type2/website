This Kombi is rather rusty in the rockers (from sitting in a feild for
almost 20 years), but is a very good driver.  Good running DP
1600.  Missing rear seat(s), and all interior panels and
headliner.  Tranny is in perfect working order with original redux
boxes.  Missing rear bumper, but I can get one for it for $15.  Some
damage to rear corners, but nose and front bumper are very nice.  See pics
on my web site.  I'm located in Northern Idaho.  Send me an e-mail for
more info or to make an offer on the bus.
