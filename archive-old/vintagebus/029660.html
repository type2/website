Hi all,

I just wanted to say thanks, for the help on my little starting prob.  It turns
out that I had the same problem that rexrogers had (See&quot;&quot;F&quot;'d up setting my end
play&quot;).  It turns out that, my main seal wasn't in all the way and got pretty
chewed up.  My end play was also off but that was because when I checked my end
play with the seal out, it was completely different than with the seal in.
Basically I'm an idiot.

What I did to solve the problem was to properly set the end play, take the old
seal and bang the new one in and put the fly wheel back on.

Rex make sure to get the seal all the way back in, especially those new ones
with the double lip.

Thanks again.
