 hey all,
 i have adjusted my brakes twice in the last 5 mos. of summer driving. after 
 each time my bus will stop on a dime! BUT, after a few weeks each time, my 
 brakes go further and further back to the floor. whats happening, are the 
 adjusters pulling the shoes back in? if i pump them twice when i need to 
 stop, they really grab, so i know they are backing off. i took the drums off 
 and the shoes arent that bad. i dont get it.
 thanks,&gt;&gt;

you know the little star thing you turn to adjust the brakes?  there is 
supposed to be a small leaf spring sort of clip that keeps the star from 
backing off.  Sometimes the spring clip gets broken and the star can turn 
back.  You will of course have to remove the drums to check this out.
