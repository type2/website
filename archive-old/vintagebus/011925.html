Subject: HIPPY BUS, engine runs (my bad speleng)
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

work on jerry jesses 67 hippy bus has started
pulled all wheels drums brakes backing plates etc,surprizingly clean, going to disassemble 
link pins and maybe king pins to clean and regrease seem a little stiff, tie rods are tight as is drag link and pivot bushing so far, going to
inspect all hard lines and pressure check (if they blow i'll replacem) replace all wheel cylinders, shoes, hoses and seals will clean all bearings replace or repack as needed.
   didn't have time this week but going to put the engine on my test stand and run it to see how it sounds and run a compression check , also a leak down test, then on to resealing it, hope no major internal problems
   recieved cargo door floor piece amd rocker pieces from wolfsburg today, will start rocker repair next week, so the ol hippy bus is on the move now hope to have my portion of the work done in a couple of weeks, seem to have gotten extremely busy in the last few weeks.

   finished the engine from h#*l and got it in the 2 owner original paint westy hardtop, it's break-in test run will be from havasu to pheonix
bug thing at the past site of the southwest bug-in (now in tuscon)about 175 miles one way good
break-it opps break-in run.i always believe in break it in the way you'll drive it.

     so if anybody cares it is a 1776 single port
engine 
     SPECS. ah case, counterweighted crank, rods balanced end to end within 1/2 gram (overkill)
mahle coated forged pistons (90.5), CB 2280 cam
their mileage maker, new german cam followers,
30 mm gear h/v oil pump, CB mini sump with internal filter, 40 mm intake valves, 32 mm exhust valves, ported and polished semi hemi cut
55 cc's, high rev springs cromoly retainers hardened keepers, new oem vw rocker assemble with 9 mm adjusters and new oem vw pushrods.
compression ratio is 7.5 to 1, used .060 copper head gaskets between cylinders and head,
intake end castings are nos empi single port hated to open the package but o-well the empi guys got pi#*ed off said it's worth to much money
to use, so what did they make them for! did save the package though. used a new  34 pict 3
carb, new 009 dizzy (didn't have time to get a vacumm advance out)will change after trip, alternator and a 3 1/2 lb. berg front pulley.
stock heater boxes and muff, so how does it run
compared to the 1600 single port that came out
wow wie, tons of low end torque smooth and actually pretty quiet, i really like it, but the road trip will see if it was worth it.
gas mileage,hill climbing, and cruising will be the proof, done this trip in a few different buses so i can compare notes

hope i didn't bore youall and my spllig dont bug ya. age - memory i guess i need brain food
