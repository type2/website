Subject: driving without a belly?

hello all,
I am in the process of doing a lot of work to my 65 singlecab this coming
week. As I was removing the treasure chest doors for hinge replacement I was
thinking how much easier it would be to fix all the lower parts if I removed
the cargo floor metal. This truck is my daily driver so it is very difficult
for me to park it for any amount of time. I was worried that if I removed
the floor metal it might weaken the structural integrity( although I cant
imagine the Rust is doing a very good job in the first place).

the floor is pretty bad but most of the rust is confined to the drivers
half, What if I cut out one side at a time?

any ideas?
thanks,
Bryan
