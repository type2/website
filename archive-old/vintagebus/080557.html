Subject: RE: [VB] sundial info

Plus, I have pics of chuck's bus posted on the vintagebus gallery, under 
sundials.  That is the gallery that I use on my www.sundial-camper_dot_com site.

I don't have any new info as of yet, as the Nixon's are busy moving and I'm 
going to give them some time to settle before pressing them for more info.

Thanks all,


Bart Daugherty
