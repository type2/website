Hi all
I can see alot of good wisdom amongst the listee's from this thread..
bringing the kids up to enjoy life,... etc
I just wanted to point out that
*I* do not own that bus,, I only found it on ebay,,,, I wanted to Buy it,,
and DRIVE it,, Long distances,, like back to my home!

I  let my kids enjoy the V W experience,, to the point I think they have
been brain washed! hahahaha!
All they know is VW! ,,,

I have one thing to say ,,, and I am not sure how to make it clear,,
some replies were kinda nasty,, and If you really have to express your
distain,, don't shoot me.. I am only the messenger thanks! LOL
:-)
I should have made the fact it isn't my Bus ,, alot clearer!
