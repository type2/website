Subject: San Jose FLAPS? 12V starter motor needed!

Listees in San Jose:

My starter/solenoid decided to fail in an interesting manner: the solenoid
is failed in the start position, and somehow entered that position *while*
I was driving home last night! So I need a new starter and solenoid. I'm
in Cupertino/West San Jose area. Any good VWFLAPS?

Needless to say, it was an interesting ride
down Stevens Creek Blvd for the mile ride. Noisy as heck! Couldn't figure
out what was happening but took it all the way home into the driveway,
turned off the key, and the loud rotating scraping sound kept going, til I
ran back there with key and 13mm ratchet, and disconnected the battery
ground bolt.

For the last few weeks, there was this very intermittent loud
scraping sound for a second or two, every three or four days, while
driving - thought my rear end or generator/fan was going, but decided to
keep using the bus til something really went, as the symptoms were very
few and far between. Then last night happened. So, new starter/solenoid
required.

Thanks!
