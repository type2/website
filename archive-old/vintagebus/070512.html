Subject: RE: [T2] Westy Rear Speaker Location

My solution to this issue was to place the speakers in the back hatch.
It's not the perfect answer but it works for me.
I have a '71 Westy, pioneer 200w 6x9s in the back, a 10&quot; sub w/ a 250w
amp under the jump seat behind the driver, I cut a hole in the side of
that cabinet, and 3 or 3.5&quot; Bostons in the dash.  I pulled the fresh air
vents out of the dash and stuck the little ones in the dash.  Having
them that close and facing the listener allows for a much smaller
speaker up front.
Bass in non-directional to your ear so the placement of the sub was
satisfactory.
The rear speakers were a problem and it took three tries to get it
right.
I used the original panel as a template and cut two sheets of 3/4&quot;
plywood to give myself enough depth for the magnets.  On my first try I
didn't make it deep enough, on the second I placed the speaker on the
passenger side too close to the outside and it struck the suicide
cabinet.  On the current iteration I got the placement correct and
covered the wood with cheap black auto carpet from checker auto before
mounting the speakers.
The last compromise was the whole mess weighed too much for the spring
system to hold it open so I cut a piece of 1/2&quot; rebar to length with a
4&quot; bend on the bottom end at 45 degrees or so, I drilled a hole in the
very bottom of the rear cabinet and stuck the 4&quot; end in the hole.  This
will lay down behind the pad on the parcel deck and when I open the
hatch it's easy to prop it open like a hood on an import.
I also mounted my am/fm/cass/cd controller in the glove box

And the cd changer in with the sub under the rear facing jump seat.
