&lt;&lt; do i have to change ALL the axle beam or only the spindle to get it 
correct to 65+ beam?&gt;&gt;

Hi Mike,
From 1 144 282 AUG63 up to chassi # 215 036 650 SEPT64 the front beams had a 
inner reamed bushing and a exterior needle bearing bushing on each trailing 
arm.  Before this each trailing arm used two reamed bushings.  From chassi # 
215 036 651 OCT64 each trailing arm now had two needle bearings.  These 
needle bearings last just about forever if greased regularly every 3,000 
miles.  Where the reamed earlier bushings ovalize slowly but surely despite 
regular greasing.

&lt;&lt;  is there any help on the web about this swap ? &gt;&gt;
You can check the archives, but the best is the Bentley reprint of the 
1963-67 VW bus shop manual.
