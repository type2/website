&gt; Hi Steve,
&gt; Pretty sure he is talking about the front doors not the cargo doors.  Since 
&gt; the cargo door hindges would be way off.  Eric&amp;Barb
Sorry,

I was using the low hinge/high hinge distinction as a time differentiaton
factor only.

I am speaking of the right and left front doors on my 61 have the
indednted door handles just like all the other front right and left
doorhandles up until early 64. The doors are undoubtedly original as they
have original mango green and grey paint that exactly matches the rest of
the bus. (i now have a digicam so i can take pix and post em if you like.)

Mid 1961 model year they switched from low hinge to high hinge on the
cargo doors and may have indented the front door handles and switched to 
the different handles at the same time.

So, since i have never personally examined an early 61 bus i cannot
comment on early 61 busses, but owning a late 61 bus and having seen other
late 61 busses i can comment on that. Since the cargo door hinges are a
very easy way to distinguish between early and late 61 busses i use that
as a reference point in regards to dating the bus.

take care,

Steve
