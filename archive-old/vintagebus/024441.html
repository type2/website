&quot;on cold mornings of only 40F. Before the oil pressure relief valve the oil
pressure will easly reach over 300 lbs. and learned by having one oil filter
explode.&quot;

What would happen if one of those temperature bypass &quot;H&quot; valves were installed in
the oil lines with good quality fittings?  The filter and/or cooler would be
bypassed until oil temp reached 176 deg, but once the oil got up to temp the
pressures should be more reasonable.
