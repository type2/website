&gt; It's Friday, and here's a trivia question.  Go to 
&gt; http://onearth_dot_com/images/trivia.jpg
&gt; and then tell me where the picture was taken.

Well, it's a right hand drive bus, so I assume that it is in a RHD
country.  The fellow in the picture doesn't look Japanese, so it isn't
Japan.  I don't think that they have chair lift ski resorts in the UK or
Oz, though I might be wrong.  That leaves New Zealand or perhaps South
Africa.  The bus has really wierd louvers on the side, which I think were
Australian, so my best guess would be New Zealand.  My confidence in
this guess isn't too high, though!
