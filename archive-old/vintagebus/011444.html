Dear Administrators of the Vintage Bus List,

I posted a question that I felt was pertinent to the vintage list.  I am
currently on the Loaf list since I have a 74 Westy, but I had a question on
a 66 parts bus.  I was hoping that I could get it posted.  The original
message follows:

&lt;
Hey list,

I wanted to see what possible parts value a 66 might have.  I came across
one that has no engine or seats in the van.  It also does not have any
chrome on the outside of it, but it does have some good parts such as:

Steering wheel
speedo
gas gauge
exterior lights (relatively good shape)
front 2 windshields
sliding door windows and their locking mechanism
interior dash parts (no radio)
tranny (no idea what condition
other stuff that I probably didn't see

I don't know a lot about splittys but I figure that the parts might be
worth more than the $50 the guy wants for the van.  One thing to keep in
mind is that I would have to tow it home and then part it out.  I looked it
over and it's pretty rotted and thus probably not worth restoring (located
in northern Indiana).  However, if someone is bent on restoring this, I
would let them buy it directly from the guy in the interest of wanting to
see another bus get back on the road.

Any input would be appreciated.  Please pmail me since I am on the loaf
list.
