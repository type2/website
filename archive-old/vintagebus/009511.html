Dear Rick
Kevin's not out of line, if he wants to criticize NQ he's perfectly within
his rights.
I happen to think Erin's a great guy, but he does sound a little high handed
on occasion. Kevin still has the right to disagree with him, that's how the
list works.
We all bring something to the table, we all share.
John :-)

&gt; Kevin, you are out of line.  Erin (NQ) has done a bunch to boost bus
&gt; interest all over this country.  When you have done as much as he has to
&gt; better the hobby, then you can critique his methods.
