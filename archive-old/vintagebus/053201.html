Subject: RE: [VB] Re: [BSKA] my new bus/here we go

  This work of art was done over 20 years ago.  The engine has the stock
Chevy bellhousing and clutch and is mated to the transmission with a flat
plate (I could remove it and put a stock VW engine in, BUT WHY) with a
coupler and extented input shaft. Most of the custom treatment was done
using 70's Olds parts, headlight grill, seats and rear bumper, The dash is
uncut and the bus still retains all it's OG glass including the windhields.
From what I can tell the center section of the body was removerd andthe rear
section moved up to the cargo door. No chassis hacks were done except in the
rear where all sheet metal was removed to allow the placement of the Chevy
engine. 
  My plan is to have it running and driving again for the Classic weekend. I
heard a rumor 

  wish me luck   ronnie

ps. I am going to take more photos today in the light to really show off the
beauty in this beast, I just couldn't let it sit and rot anymore!

One word,   YIKES!!!
You are one brave guy.

I had to download the photos and then bring them up in my photo software and
lighten them up to see all the gory details.  It was quite revealing.

Does it now or did it ever run?
Was that engine mated up to the VW trans?
What changes were made inside?  racing seats?
Those tires (the ones still in place) look like its been sitting for years.

have fun,

Scott

BTW ronnie, know of anyone out there in the desert in need of a dump truck?
The college club that I'm advisor for is auctioning a 1965 Ford Dump truck
on
ebay.
We drove the thing a couple weeks ago, the five miles to move it to its
current
location.

&gt;    I picked up another bus today, it's a 1960 kombi/truck powered by a old
&gt; Chevy iron duke engine. A true piece of make what you got work (watch out
&gt; Road Cow).
