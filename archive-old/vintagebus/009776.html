Hi Folks,
I posted to both lists, cause I wanted suggestions how to ship a large
item,, like an engine or in this case the front axle beam from a 74 Bus,
should be same as shipping a early bus beam right?
I plan on putting it on a pallet

I have a really nice rust free,, fresh from West Coast Canada,, Front axle
beam for sale, It is complete from rotors to drag link, and in great shape!
Listee's first,, then Ebay
the problem is shipping,, If I have to, I will take it to Niagara Falls
NY,or Detroit,  and ship it from a US location,,

What I really wanted from this bus was a good set of 1.8 liter heads,, but I
got this beam that is way tooo good to go to the scrap!
If you need this beam, and want to set up shipping yourself,, contact me and
we can make some arrangements
Thanks!
