Subject: Re: [VB] Busses and Harbor Freight

Cal,

Good advice - the original metal fuel line on my 70 was almost cut thru by 
the sheet metal in spite of the original rubber grommet that I religiously 
replaced at each engine removal. I now split a new piece of fuel hose to fit 
over the new gas line and then clamp it in place with a couple of snap ties 
on each side of the sheet metal.

Harbor Freight:

First heard of Harbor Freight when Bob Hoover mentioned HF in his 
posts/sermons so I blame Bob for the $5037.50 (per Quicken) I have spent at 
Harbor Freight  since my first visit in 1999 and the fact that I can barely 
move around in my basement because of HF drill press, hydraulic press, and 
other junk.

Phil
70 type 2 since new

---- Original Message ----- 

&gt; what Curt is referring to, is that I ranted once many years ago, about
 how Harbor Freight was just a chinese importing company masquerading as a
 US hardware store chain. I'm also known as the POR-15 guy, being that I
was the first on the list to begin posting about it, back in 96 or so.

Anyway, old list history. Bus content:
 All newbies, and all others - prevent engine fires: slip a slit 2&quot; piece
 of VW fuelline over your metal fuel line where it goes thru the front tin
 piece. Check that metal line first for the groove cut into it by that tin
 piece before doing so. Replace if grooved or cut at all! Number one cause
 of engine fires!
