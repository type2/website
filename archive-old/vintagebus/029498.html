Subject: Steering Wheel Removal

Another Method and Picasso Restoration link.

This weekend I removed a perfect steering wheel and steering box off of
a 61 Panel, I read with interest last weeks post about steering wheel
removal, This is what I found out by doing myself and another way to
remove the steering wheel:

I was ready to boil water at the junk yard to help remove the wheel if
necessary but didn't have too, what I did was to go ahead and unbolt the
5 screws that hold the steering box to the frame, let it hang from it's
own weight of the steering shaft, put your
puller on your steering wheel and slowly tighten down, what you are
doing now is pushing the steering shaft off of the wheel
as oppose to pulling the wheel off the shaft. It worked perfect both
times this weekend, cause I had my new box and wheel
on the 64 single cab by Saturday evening. Some might say the shaft would
get bent but I can't see how, not enough room for
it to bend, oh yea leave your shaft attached to the parcel tray with the
13 mm screws, undo the Phillips head at the front of the
steering shaft holder and push the collar down a bit.

I also made a puller out of a [_] piece of scrap that I cut a U into to
go around the shaft and to rest on the bottom of the
wheel. Then I took a puller that I have and ran the bolts through it and
the lower puller, then tighten down the big screw with your shaft still
protected by it's loosened nut, when the shaft pushes through the bolt
will help keep it secure.

Some might remember my post about the bent drag link, if you wanna see
how bad check out &quot;drag link&quot; at

I have also posted a few pics on the progress of Picasso, the 64 Single
Cab restoration.
