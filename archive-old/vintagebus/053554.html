Roger,

Though I do not know the specs myself for these screws, I do know where you 
can get the info (and much more).  Contact Henry at:

vdragon_at_concentric_dot_net

He sells complete stainless fastener kits for bugs and buses, and he is sure 
to not only be able to tell you what you need, but also sell it to you.  
You'll find he is an excellent person to deal with.

Richard

Hey all,

	Does anyone know the specs (or VW part number) on the screws used to hold 
the fresh air vent cover plate on?

	I assume it would be the same ones you would use for an ambulance fan, too.

	I looked in my Parts Manual and found nothing!!!!

	THANKS!

Roger N.
