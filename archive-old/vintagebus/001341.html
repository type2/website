Did anyone happen to notice that nice silver single cab from Nevada at the
phx bug-o-rama? I was standin there lookin at it when the judges walked
up.....These are supposed to be pay-for-hire judges im assuming by all the
matching T-shirts (guess they quit the ppls choice). Well anyway, one of
them asked the other about the chrome safaris the guy had installed.........
guy#1 &quot;Are these original?&quot;
guy#2 &quot;No, these are reproductions...........But single cabs came stock with
them so we gotta give him points for that.....&quot;

WTF I thought these guys were supposed to be know-it-all vintage nazis if
theyre gonna judge on stock and purity! I just held my toungue and walked
the other way.  I suppose the chrome gate latches, the metallic silver paint
job, spray-in bedliner, and red vinyl with white piping was stock on all
singles too??? Didnt stick around to find out.
Who are these ppl who judge on the stock class and are they given any kind
of intructions or required to have knowledge before hand?
How are the judges in california? I would hope at least they would be
knowledgable...what about it thom? frankie? I'm not bitchin about the bus
not being stock. It was nice and I give the guy credit.

VW show judges should either be stock judges with possible reference or
&quot;that car is nice&quot; judges, not a mixture of both just makin sh*t up.

end of rant
P.S. What does it take to get your car on the grass area? Ive seen anything
from nice cars to projects in there.
