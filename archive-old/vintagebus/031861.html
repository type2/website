TMI is the originator and manufacturer of all the original (replacement) bus
interior fabrics. The platium (shirt) is actually a Mustang fabric and TMI
found it to be the closet there was to original without having to go out and
make it. They have allready invested a fortune in doing the print and
texture fabrics and felt along with some of the bus GERU's that the platium
fabric would work fine. It is almost an exact match to the platium skirt
material when faded/aged. How do I know, both of my 66 deluxes had the
original material under some funky aftermarket covers to which we compared
the TMI fabric to. I have been told though that if you really want to be
anal about the skirt that Transporter Restorations, aka Upolstery Haus has
the correct skirt material and will also make you the correct covers if you
send your seats to them to have them done complete. They do not sell just
covers.

Wes, What you have there in the pic IS mesh Platinum.
The color on Wolfsburg wests site is called Mesh
Platinum, but their new repro color is a bit more
gold.

Some theorize that they developed their swatch from a
piece of old mesh platinum which sat in  a bus for
years and darkened with age. your sample there has
been concealed under a re-upholstry for several years,
preserving the true color which is more silver or,
well, &quot;Platinum&quot;.

Someone correct me if I'm wrong, are the WW interiors
from TMI?

A quick phone call to them would answer that.

Jason

The solid color of mesh grey is very dark, like
charcoal grey.

&gt; David, this confuses me because the original color I
&gt; see does not even 
&gt; resemble the &quot;mesh platinum&quot; color that Wolfsburg
&gt; West sells.  I don't 
&gt; believe the color around the skirt could go from the
&gt; tannish color of 
&gt; platinum to the silvery color it is now.
&gt; Also, I just got done stripping my front seats this
&gt; afternoon.  Their 
&gt; situation is the same as in the back, so I know the
&gt; van came with this 
&gt; color.  What's the deal?  Is platinum a silvery
&gt; color?  And if so, is the 
&gt; tannish color that WW is advertising incorrect?

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Looks like platinum to me.  A grey might get
&gt; lighter, but it wont
&gt; &gt;generally turn toward a beige tone.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;the platinum will get darker with age, due to dirt
&gt; etc.
