The middle seat will work with no problems. [Unless you are putting a full
width seat in a bus that only has the keyways for a 3/4 seat]  You need the
seat holddowns from the 71 and a 17mm wrench or the original
wingnuts.....like these:

He always has them on ebay, but not right now. See the 4 long studs standing
up? They are for the middle seat. The 2 short ones laying down in front are
for the rear seat.

The rear seat will not be a direct bolt in swap. Does your 65 have a rear
heater log laying across the back where the rear seat sits? [panels and
kombis don't, standard and  deluxe does] If yes, MAKE sure the bottom
section of the rear seat has a short middle leg. Look at the 3 legs, if all
are flush across the front, it will NOT fit. If the middle leg is recessed
about 3'', it will clear the heater log. If you don't have a rear heater
log, either seat style will work.
In order to install the rear seat back section, you will need to make new L
brackets 1'' longer. The bay seat is 2'' shorter than a split seat. You will
have an extra 1'' gap on each end.

&gt; I would appreciate your thoughts on this:
&gt;
&gt; I am getting two bench seats from a '71 for my '65--the middle and rear
&gt; seats.  I really really need the rear seat, and would ultimately like the
&gt; middle seat if there's a reasonable way to make it removable (by me) when
&gt; I need it, or don't.
&gt;
&gt; Can this be done?  How?
