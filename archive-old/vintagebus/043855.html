Subject: Souce for OEM VW filter pumps
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.LNX.4.21.0106111653230.695-100000_at_westfailure_dot_net&gt;

Well,

Many people like the filter pumps, but think the quality of the
aftermarket units stinks... (myself included) The CB one is decent, but I
don't like dealing with CB, and would rather have an original volkswagen
part.

I ran across this link at btlmex for the real deal volkswagen item...

http://www.btlmex_dot_com/shop/?page=shop/flypage&amp;product_id=45&amp;category_id=e79995870ae9b4b727ca909fcc114866

Dunno how BTLmex is to deal with, kinda bugs me they dont have a telephone
number other than a fax, but regardless at least there is now a source for
quality filter pumps again.

take care,

Steve

P.S. i know, i know, the filter sticks into the hot air, but I figure if
VW does it on the beetles from the factory it cant be that big of a deal.
