Subject: RE: [VB] door seals

Ronnie gave good advise.

Also keep in mind that these door seal items tend to shrink (in length)
slightly when in colder weather. (referring to the running length front and
cargo door seals, not the preformed mitered corner one piece seals or window
seals) Use caution if installing while in warmer weather. You might experience
a cold weather seal that is too short if it was &quot;cut to length&quot; for perfect fit
in sunnier times and higher temps.

Just my opinion and from personal experience. I could be totally wrong and the
only one on Earth to have experienced this... but I doubt it. I tend to scrunch
as much seal length into place as is practical and still usable in any temp.
Glue will retain the length only to a certain degree.

You can always cut more off if necessary. Adding length is possible but might
be unsightly (if you care).
