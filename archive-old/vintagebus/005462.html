On the subject of doing non-stock repairs.... has anyone put in/ made to
work a 71 bay turn signal switch in a 66/67? I can get a 71 switch from a
bus in a wrecking yard. Other than it is totally black, I can paint the
housing white, will it work with the 9 pin box? Physically it resembles the
66/67 switch.
