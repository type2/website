Subject: my tranny leaks no more... but...

Hi there.
Well, I got my tranny back from the fix-it guy.  The centre section doesn't
leak anymore, which is good, I guess.  Except from one spot near the very
front where there are 3 little holes that look like there should be plugs in
them... would that be just a plastic plug or???

That's the good news.  Now on to the bad.
1. of course he filled the tranny with GL-5, so I'll have to drain it all
out.
2.  he was supposed to rebuild the reduction boxes, but he only changed ONE
(upper) bearing on each side.  At least they did have broken cages but I
suspect the rest are shot too.  I didn't realize at the time that there are
3 bearings in each box, I thought there were only two.  He said he couldn't
get at the lower bearings because he couldn't get the frost plugs out.  How
hard is that really?  I guess I need to pull the redux boxes back apart and
fix them properly... looks like a lot of special tools are required
according to the official manual...
3.  the axle boots are wrecked.  My local VWflaps sells one size which they
claim fits both bugs and busses, altho last time I tried to use one of these
I could never get it to seal totally (air could be heard entering and
exiting the boot when I squeezed it) no matter how much I tried and upon
examination it appears the new boots are just a teensy bit smaller... is
this the usual or???

So, basically I'm back where I started, except that I don't have a terrible
leak anymore.  Oh, and my bus is in pieces...  Not very hopeful at the
moment.
Diana
