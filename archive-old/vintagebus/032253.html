&gt;I had a good Pomona too.

Was it something in the air? I had a good time too. I picked up a parts
manual (up to 67) for a heck of a lot less than one I had lost on eBay! I
was also finally able to find a good set of the mechanism for my EZ Camper
bed. It's never worked right since some friends sat on the very edge...I've
found tons of Z-beds, but never one of these.
Said hi to Ronnie (you gotta say hi to Ronnie...he drives so far!) Picked
up the 50 year Brekina set and some other smaller items. Passed out flyers
for the Spring Festival Vintage VW Meet coming up at the end of the month
and flyers about our friends stolen bus.
Topped it off with the Charleston Chicken Ranch sandwich combo at Dennys.

Whatta day!
