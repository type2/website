Subject: Stollen bus report

Just a update on my neighbor's bus.  He went out to Pomona to try and
find it or parts of it.  No luck there.  No leads from anywhere else
either.

On a good note, he did buy another bus.  A 65 Deluxe micro walk thru.
Original paint, interior, 6v.  95% complete.  Real nice.  A little more
rust then i would want to tackle, but he is excited.  It hase rusty top
windows and floor.  Picked it up in Chico, CA.

I am still trying to get the VIN of his old bus to help in the search.

Matthew
