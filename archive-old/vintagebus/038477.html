Hi,

You asked for it so...........:)

On Saturday nite the 15th of April  the ROANOKE VALLEY BUS DRIVERS will be
sponsoring a pot luck dinner for the EveryBus campers at the picnic shelter
in our camping loop. Here is how it works: The RVBD are gonna cook up
hamburgers and hotdogs for all. They have the burgers and dogs, buns,plates,
forks, napkins and a lot love in their hearts cause they are doing this for
FREE. 

You too can help feed the masses of hungry bus drivers and their families(
and no doubt their dogs :) by providing a side-dish, drinks, condiments,
fixins, ice, deserts or whatever might taste yummy. It is likely that there
will be at least 150 people to feed this year and maybe more so please
please please pitch in if you can!

Contcat Jeff Burks jeffburks_at_mindspring_dot_com and let him know if you are
gonna bring something so he can coordinate the spread.

As always info on EveryBus can be found at the address in my sigline.
