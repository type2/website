 Bad description, sorry. I meant to say that the shifter wasn't pushing down
 easily any longer.
 Seems to have disaapeared this morning, perhaps I was having a moron
 moment.....Long Tuesday.....
  &gt;&gt;

I would take the shift stick off, there are 2 13mm (or 14mm, depending on 
what year you bus is) on the floor unde rthe mat.  clean the socket and the 
all the spring and ball etc .  Regrease and reassemble.  crud is bad.  grease 
is good.   if you bus is 65 or earlier you will have to prop something under 
the shift rod when you put the stick back together, or have someone hold it.  
If you have a later bus you have to line to pin of the ball with the slot of 
the socket.   The guide plate goes upside down and backwards from the shift 
pattern.
