Subject: dizzy discussion on T2

Hal over on the T2 list recently had a good discussion with jim Thompson
about dizzys... pretty neat info that clarifies a few things. I think :)



I recently P-mailed Old Volks regarding some Distributor questions I had =
about my 71 Bus after looking at their Dizzy interchange charts. What =
follows is the bulk of our conversation, which I found helpful.  Here =
goes:

Me:  I'm looking at your distributor interchange chart and am trying to =
figure out what exactly I can and can't use with my   '71 bus that I =
don't know a whole lot about.  As I understand it, a particular =
distributor was paired to a particular engine based upon the cam and =
carbeuretor that were on the engine.  AFAIK the stock cam was the same =
for all the 1600DP single carb engines, so I'll assume that that is a =
constant I don't need to worry about.  The carb is the 34 PICT 3, which =
was stock for the year.  I'll also assume my displacement is standard, =
but I don't think that should matter. =20
************

Expert: Yep, right so far.  The cam wasn't so much of an item to base =
the distributor on.  The most important criteria was the emission =
standard for that particular model year forthat car, it's weight, =
powerplant, etc.  VW &amp; Bosch were regularly changed on a yearly basis to =
meet the emission standard of that year.
************

Me: Are there other engine factors I should be concerned with or is that =
it? I know my engine isn't the original one (no big surprise), but I'm =
not sure how much that matters.  Still, I'd like to replace the 009 I've =
got with a vacuum advance/retard distributor given the various info I've =
read on reinstalling the vac adv/ret distributor. So, it looks like the =
'71 bus can share distributors with the '74 autostick bug (0231 176 033) =
or with the 72-3 manual bug (0231 167 070).
Am I trying to find the distributor with an advance curve that best =
matches that of the 71 Bus' OE specifications?  If that is the case, the =
070 distributor choice confuses me because it appears to have a slightly =
different advance curve (especially with regard to the initial vacuum =
advance).  Can I take the interchanges to the second tier? For example =
can I use the alternate distributor for the '74 autostick bug? This =
would be the '75 FI Autostick Bug (0231 176 053). In this case the curve =
is even more different. I really don't know if I'm just splitting hairs =
here.  If so, please let me know; I'm just looking for better =
performance (I have a bit of a dead spot right now when I take off).
***************************

Expert: When originally assembling the database, I had documentation =
from Bosch showing the trail of distributor number supersessions =
stretching from 1971 thru 1974 on the upright engine models.  Actually =
all dual vacuum/mechanical distributors were interchangeable from many =
points of view, even with just slight variances in vacuum Hg, mechanical =
rpms, etc. It was kind of a confusing state of affairs.  I could have =
lumped a pile of numbers saying they all fit each other.  But I chose =
instead to list them as they actually were installed originally on the =
vehicle, showing some supersessions along the way.  A careful look at =
the webpage showing distributors by Bosch number will show a trail of =
supersessions from 1971 all the way to the 1974 Beetle distributors, =
which to this day are still the replacement numbers for all that =
preceded 1974 applications. (And people wonder why it took me 8 months =
to put the specifications page together!  As recently as last year, I =
have had to make a correction here, a correction there...it's been a =
work in progress.)

So essentially, you are correct in much of what you feel in the way of =
interchangeability.  It's ideal to use the original distributor whenever =
possible, but sometimes things cannot be ideal, so you use what may be =
available.

Originally, your 1971 Bus was equipped with a Dual Vacuum, Mechanical =
Advance distributor (to over simplify it, a 009 with Vacuum =
Advance/Retard Assist).  So were Manual Transmission Beetles from 71 =
thru 74 (All Calif models, a few Federal Models).  The 211 905 205S/0231 =
180 001 distributor came equipped with a Speed-Limiting Rotor, but had =
the same advance/retard
curves as the 211 905 205Q/0231 167 055.  Both distributors were =
superseded by VW &amp; Bosch in the early 80s to the 043 905 205D/0231 176 =
033 distributor utilized by the California 1974 Auto Stick Trans Beetle. =
 Curves are slightly different, but acceptable by the US EPA as an =
acceptable replacement.  Was it a better distributor?  Probably so, =
parts are more
readily available (relatively speaking).  Would it have met the 1971 =
standard imposed on the Bus?  Maybe not.  But then today's current EPA =
acceptable emission standards verses EPA year-then model testing =
standards are not the same.  California Air Resources Board (CARB) =
standards for emission testing in California weren't even formulated in =
1971, so today's
standards are basically arbitrary, mostly along Federal standards for =
71-73, because California didn't start throwing it's weight around until =
1974 (hence the Cal and Fed models in 1974).

I'm getting off the beaten track here though.  The following =
distributors are definitely useable on your 71 Bus:
211 905 205Q/0231 167 055
211 905 205S/0231 180 001 (you can use a regular rotor BTW)
113 905 205AJ/0231 167 049
113 905 205AH/0231 167 053
113 905 205AN/0231 167 070
043 905 205C/0231 176 028
043 905 205D/0231 176 033

All of the above should be timed at 5 degrees AFTER TDC at about 900rpm =
idle, both vacuum hoses connected and with a strobe light.  To bench set =
a cold engine, align the rotor to TDC #1 Cylinder, then fire up to set =
strobiscopicaly after the engine is sufficiently warmed up.

The following Single Vacuum/Mechanical Advance distributors can be used =
as well:

113 905 205AL/0231 146 101
043 905 205/0231 170 034
043 905 205A/0231 170 036

All of the above should be timed at 7.5 degrees BEFORE TDC at about =
900rpm idle, vacuum hose disconnected and plugged.

Timing figures given here are NOT absolutes.  These figures apply to =
BRAND-NEW engines with BRAND-NEW distributors.  Sometimes you will find =
that with some wear and tear, timing has to be fiddled with for the =
engine to run best.  Take my 84 Westy - it's normally 5 ATDC, but I have =
found it runs best at 0 TDC.

I wouldn't recommend (based on experience) using the 1975-1979 era =
distributors.  They'd idle fine, but would poop out before reaching top =
end (only 23 degrees max verses the 25-28 degrees of the other models). =
Remember, carburetion air/fuel mixture was a higher variable than fuel =
injection air/fuel mixture, and that distributor was designed to =
compensate for it to prevent detontaion (pinging).  FI upright engines =
ran the hottest of all, but the most efficient in power/emissions before =
VW had to give up try to meet US/California specs.

Another thing - Dual Vacuum distributors installed on the Type 4 variety =
72-79 Buses are set up a bit different and don't work well on the =
upright without a lot of finesse.  Any distributor with a VW prefix of =
021, 022, 039 or 071 should be avoided.

Yer not splitting hairs, yer just asking perfectly valid questions with
hopefully good informative answers.
&lt;End&gt;

Anyway, hope this is helpful to you all too.
