&gt;
&gt;Wanted to ask again how to time at full advance. I've read the archives and 
&gt;see that I need a timing analyzer. I take it I can't do it with a standard 
&gt;strobe light. Is this correct?

You need either:

a regular strobe light AND a degreed pulley or degree ring on pulley

OR

a timing analyzer (adjustable strobe light)

A plain strobe light, or a timing analyzer set on zero, will flash
the strobe exactly when the #1 spark plug fires.  This is why you
need the degreed pulley or degree wheel, so you can read the value
on the pulley/wheel at the crankcase seam when it is illuminated
by the strobe light.

The timing analyzer lets you adjust when the strobe flashes relative
to when #1 spark plug fires.  This way, you can use the notch(es)
that are already on your pulley.  Assuming you have a TDC mark/notch
on the pulley, you run the engine at the specified revs, adjust the
timing analyzer control for the specified advance, and adjust the
distributor to line up the notch and the crankcase seam (when seen
under the strobe).  If your mark/notch is something else, you have
to do a little math, but the idea is the same.  For example, if
you have a 5 BTDC notch, and you want to time at 30 BTDC, you have
to set the analyzer for 25 BTDC.  If the notch is 5 ATDC and you
want 30 BTDC, you have to set the analyzer for 35 BTDC. 

&gt;So do I rev the engine to 3000 RPMS and time at 28-30 BTDC ? How do I 
&gt;figure out where on the pulley that 28-30 mark is?

I saw an old Chilton's manual that had a degree wheel that you could
photocopy, glue to a sheet of cardboard, and stick on the pulley.
You could also use a protractor to measure and mark it.  You can
also do the trig - 30 BTDC from TDC will be on the 0.518 * R long chord
with one endpoint at TDC.  R is the radius of your pulley.  Derivation
of other angles is left as an exercise for the reader.  :)

&gt;Since I've got a '75 FI case, with a 34 PICT carb, and a vacume advance 
&gt;disty from a 60's model vehicle (can't seem to figure out what it actually 
&gt;is) , I'm just not sure where to time at idle.

Did you check the distributor listings at 
http://www.oldvolkshome_dot_com/ignition.htm ?

&gt;So I figure the best solution is to time at full advance and let it be 
&gt;where it's gonna be. Does this sound right?

Sounds good to me.  I think the important thing is not having the
timing advanced too far, so if the setting you get by doing this
doesn't make it run well, you might try backing off a bit in the
direction of less advance to see if it helps.  If you can't get it
to run right at all engine speeds no matter what you do, then you
probably need a different distributor.

&gt;As well as what I need to look for in a timing analyzer (if I 
&gt;need on that is).

There seems to be basically two kinds: analog and digital.  The analog
ones have a knob on the back with a degree scale, and the digital ones
have a couple of pushbuttons and an LED or LCD display.  I bought a
fancy Mac digital one (used) that also has a tach built in.  If you have
a 6v Bus you'll also need some kind of separate power supply for the
analyzer.

I hope this helps!
