Subject: Re: [VB] Fuel bulkhead fittings

Al,

I did the following about 11 years ago: I drilled a 1/2&quot; hole to the left
of the engine in the 'firewall' (vertical area dropping down from tank
level), smoothed it out with a round file, slapped some POR15 on the work,
and fitted a neoprene double walled 1/2&quot; OD fuel line from the tank outlet
thru the new hole, into a brass, marine-quality, manual fuel cutoff valve,
and over to my electric fuel pump, mounted nearby on that vertical strut.
From there a VW fuel line goes around and up and over to the carb inlet,
secured on the way, to the roof of the engine room with nylon ties. To
pull the engine, I merely disconnect at the carb, put in the pencil stub,
and go.  There's a small fuel filter in the path as well. When its time to
change the fuel pump, just turn off the fuel with that valve.
