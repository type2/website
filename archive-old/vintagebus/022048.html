All--

Re the interior rearview mirror for a 1967 singlecab:

There doesn't seem to be a reproduction of this particular part.  Or is 
there?  Is this one-year-only?  Any offers to sell used ones?

BTW, I do have the original (?) mirror, but the ball is so loose in the hole, 
that it just flops down and you get a good view of the front seat.--David

yes the 67 rear view mirror is one year only.   the way the base and rotater 
ball are shaped. For a truck it is the same as any 67.   However, any splitty 
rear view mirror would fit exactly the same.   I would use one from a 65-67  
though, if possible, as they are somewhat larger, the offset ones.  but any 
mirror would be more useful than what you describe!!!
