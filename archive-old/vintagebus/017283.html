Bet you'll find that your flasher relay runs *really* fast - more like
a door buzzer than a blinker.  The current draw of the bulbs is an
important factor in the operating characteristics of the system.  Same
idea as why it operates twice as fast as normal when one bulb's burned
out.

The correct solution will involve the LEDs, and also coming up with
some sort of replacement for the flasher relay that doesn't care how
much current is being drawn through it.  I'm thinking there are
definite possibilities in those six-volt flasher units that Herr
Stoermer mentioned.  All we have to do is figure out how to get a
flash/don't flash signal back there to select which way to pretend
that the &quot;on&quot; switch is set.  Probably will involve running an extra
set of wires back.

Hmm.  Really also need the same thing in front in yellow, so we don't
need a flasher relay for the front, and a completely different thing
for the back.

I suppose we could be really evil and keep the current setup, and just
tap off the power side of the rear bulbs for power for the LEDs (which
get their own solid ground connection).  That would require the least
amount of wiring shenanigans.  You do have the problem of finding some
place to mount the LEDs then, though, since the light's still in the
existing housing.

One advantage of this last option would be that the six-volters can
use the unit Herr Stoermer mentioned, and the twelve-volters can use
Herr Margiotti's unit.  Otherwise we have to mess around with voltage
dividers or other things that aren't well-suited to the harsh
vehicular environment.

Since I'm planning on doing some conversion along these lines before
the end of the year, I'll definitely be putting more thought into all
this.
