Message-ID: &lt;36E07459.14336158_at_deltanet_dot_com&gt;

Does anyone have a original front door panel with thrim on it they can
inspect for me?  I am trying to figure out what length's the trim should
be.  I have one 21-1/2&quot; and two 13-1/2&quot; pieces that i think go to the
door's but am not sure.  I need to buy 3 more pieces and am not sure
which i need.

Thanks for the help.

PS.  anyone have the other 3 FS?
Matthew
