&gt; Any suggestions how to get this paint off?
&gt; 
Hi Michael,
Try &quot;3M Safest Stripper&quot; from your local hardware store.  We have used this 
several times to remove coats of later paint from over factory paint off of 
VWs and cleaned vynil visors of spray paint with great success and no nasty 
chemical fumes to boot!  The only hard part is you will have to test for how 
long an application is needed for this stripper to function properly.
