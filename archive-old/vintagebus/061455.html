Patience dear Hoops!~
I only had enough time to offend a certain number of folks and distance another
set and still maintain connectivity to spouse of twelve years as of today.
Celebrated by attending the 12th Anniversary Jerome Jamboree. Was introduced at
least once as the resident schizophrenic. I think that they actually meant
psychotic but I will let it slide~ (for now- Bahahahahaha!) ;-0 !!!!

My mojo bag and muse both told me that last week was not the time in which to
expound on Sky Dog issues. I promise to conjur enough of the right ingredients
from which I will extract the meaning of life according to Gold top Les Pauls.
In a word, Friday only has so many hours in it and I was packing for a road
trip and don't dare draft VanBondoesque diatribes from the work location.
The up side is that I had even more incredible dreams last night. Dang! I'm
surprised that the carbonmonoxide alarm didn't go off in the Eurovan camper and
the &quot;flashback&quot; alarm did not go off in my head.
The family is, by now, used to me waking up screaming at the voices imploring
them to stop or at least assist with the typing! ;-)

On hold until NEXT Friday... Allman's Mansion.
For now I need to catch some ZZZZs with my newly acquired 'New Kids on the
Block' pillow case.
