A few simple questions.

1.  Did brakes and bearings on the 67.  Only grease I had on hand was white multi purpose.  Subsequently realized that there is drum brake grease for wheel bearings.  Will the white stuff be ok, or should I re-pack the the other stuff??

2.  I have a T3 oil cooler that has a threaded boss on the backside of the cooler.  Can I plug the hole and use it in my upright T2 dog house fan shroud?

3.  How many muffler doughnut clamps should come in a typical installation kit?

Thanks.


Steve
