Subject: Pulling motor 1st Time-What 2change
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Well its time to pull my 1st motor. I will be coached along by someone who 
can do it in their sleep hopefully this will help me understand how things 
connect and work, better than reading the bentley manual. God I love that 
book. &quot;Ya know your getting old when automotive manuals become your chice 
reading material&quot;. (LOL) My question is: What replacement parts will I need 
prior to dropping the motor. I can guess manifold seals but what else? Also 
what are things to check out prior to placing the motor back in? The reason I 
am dropping it is I have an oil leak straight up from somewhere in front of 
my air shroud. I'm guessing its my doghouse style oil cooler. Also the P.O. 
didnt reinstall the exhaust shroud for the doghouse cooler and some other pie 
shaped piece of shrouding that most go in the same vicinity.
Wish me luck!
