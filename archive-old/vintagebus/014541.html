&lt;&lt; this first time engine rebuild is starting to turn into a pain in the ass.

Erin,

I know what you mean.  On the advice of all, I didn't casesaver an engine 
(that is in my '59 camper you saw this weekend).  Well, in the middle of a 
marathon 4000 mile month of travel (camping in four different states on four 
subsequent weekends) earlier this year, I had to completely tear down my 
engine, and install case savers, and then reassemble the thing in a week.

Like Kurt Vonnegut says, &quot;so it goes.&quot;

Good luck, but we all know you'll make it!

JP
