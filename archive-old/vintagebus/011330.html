&gt; Anyone know of a source for a parts manual?  I know where to find the Bently
&gt; Workshop Manual, but I am looking for a comprehensive parts manual.
&gt; (owner's manual would be nice too)

I am slowly but surely putting one online along with whatever else I can collect.  I've been privately miffed about not finding them for years, and when I see xeroxes sold on eBay for $50+, and originals for generally exorbitant amounts...I figured &quot;what the heck&quot; and started scanning.

FWIW I photocopied a 72 bug parts list, and the cost at Kinko's was about $75, regardless of the hours it took me.  You can't put the originals through the autocopier as it will mangle the pages and I had to give the original back in good shape.  Yes that is much fatter than the early bus lists, so the photocopying cost for thinner books is less.  Steve Howell on the list was selling xeroxes for about $35, which is eminently reasonable, he had a 71 bug edition, and a 67 bus edition I think.
