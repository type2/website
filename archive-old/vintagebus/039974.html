well, i feel i have to comment on this. i am not commenting to throw fuel on 
the fire, just to present both sides of the Bus Depot story. i have only 
ordered from Bus Depot 3 times, but every time they have screwed it up. and 
the funny thing is, it seemed this was only happening to me :-) everyone 
else it seemed, had great experiences. i have to say after the errors, Ron 
did everything he could to get me the right stuff fast. the problem seemed 
to be with his help. they seem to tell you what you want to hear, and are 
just &quot;yes&quot; people. i think if Ron answers the phone, you'll get what you 
need. its really not his fault he cant get ACVW people like us to answer 
phones and take orders, but come on, he's in Philly! he did post on the list 
for &quot;help wanted.&quot;

the shipping thing bothers me too. some of the time, the stuff you order, is 
shipping from somwhere else! RMM, WCM, whatever. i live in cleveland, and IF 
my stuff is packaged within a day or even two days, i should get it within 5 
days MAX. i've waited three weeks for stuff. so orders must be laying around 
for a day or so. and back ordered stuff, they dont even tell you about it 
being backordered. its a great company, poorly managed. sorry ron. JUST AN 
OPINION! if i need parts to get my bus RIGHT BACK ON THE ROAD, ill order 
from somewhere else. if i need stuff i can wait on, Bus Depot will get my 
$$$... their prices are great!

later,
