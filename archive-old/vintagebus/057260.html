&gt; VW radios should normally be wired to the &quot;battery hot&quot; wire, so that

&gt; it's possible to run your battery down with the radio, so you have to
&gt; get in the habit of checking the radio before you leave the car.  My
&gt; Dad was concerned about this, so I put a lighted switch in the radio
&gt; power wire in his Bug - it lights up when the switch is on as a visual
&gt; reminder for him to turn it off when he leaves the car.

The problem with this is some modern radios draw considerable current in
the &quot;ignition on, radio off&quot; state.  Radios often have clocks and
illuminated displays that light up when the ignition is turned on even if
the radio is off.  If you wire them to an always hot terminal, it is
likely that you will run your battery down.  You can either wire them to
the &quot;key on&quot; terminal and use them only when the engine is on, or wire
them to an &quot;always on&quot; terminal through a switch so you can turn the
display off when you park.  If you're tricky, you can wire
them up with a SPST switch so that the radio works with the ignition and
then works without it with the switch flipped.
