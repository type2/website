&lt;&lt; I searched the archives on this, and couldn't find the answer. Is there a
 seal that goes between the reduction boxes and the spring plates? After
 replacing my tranny some time ago, I've got a leak there on the left side.
 The right side holds fluid just fine. If there is no seal, should I use some
 kind of sealant? It looks like I can jack up the left side, unbolt the redux
 box from the spring plate (maybe remove the wheel first), pry the spring
 plate back a bit, and squeeze some sealant in there. Would this be possible?

Wilder,
As Thom says there's a plug in the back of the reduction box that should be 
resealed, but I've done what you're contemplating, and it worked for me.  I'd 
only plan on the sealant lasting a little while, though.
