Subject: Static timing light (my .02)

Hey folks.
Seems to me it's simpler to mount a lamp on the roof of the engine room
and set up a moveable lead.  when you need to check your timing, attach
the lead to your coil.  When you want light (checking the oil at
night?), simply clip the lead to Battery+ (leave the other side grounded
all the time).  Just be careful how you stow the lead.
Dave
