Subject: Re: [VB] fuel pump placement

This may come from the old days of vaporlock. The fuel lines near the 
hot engine would turn the fuel to vapor just before the pump. Fuel 
pumps do not pump vapor.  The fuel is cool in the tank. So by placing 
the pump near the tank, the pump would be pumping cool liquid and not 
overheated gas vapors. I don't see how this would be an issue on a 
type 2 however.

&gt;i have read that the closer you can place the
&gt;electrick fuel pump to the gas tank the better? what
&gt;is the reasoning behind this?
