I also have a

&gt; space.  Also 
&gt; useful when someone backs out of a driveway w/o looking 
&gt; behind them-   the 
&gt; horn has definately averted a couple accidents.

The 6v horn(we call it a hooter)is a big plus. My '60 has the original in a
12v system and the thing wails. People can't help but notice when I fire off
a blast with it.
