&lt;&lt; My neighbor wants me to buy his 66 panel, but the only problem is that he
is
 having trouble pulling the engine to fix the clutch. Seems he has the bolts
 unbolted, but can not find where to hook the &quot;hook&quot; on the cherry picker. On
 the manifold? Or would this rip out the studs on the heads? Asking for a
 friend. &gt;&gt;
Hi Lyle,
Just in case this is not a joke.  You remove the engine by lowering it and
backing it out on a hydralic jack.  Either you or he need to buy the Idiot's
manual By John Muir and later the Bentley reprint of the pre-1968 bus shop
manual before things or people get hurt.  Eric &amp; Barb
