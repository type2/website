it's friday I have 2 &quot;non-bus &quot; question
&gt; although it is VW related!
&gt; 1 Is there a bug list as good as this bus list
&gt; ??&lt;&lt;

There is a fledgling VW Type 1 list, although it is not near as strong as the
bus lists, it is new and growing with 60+ members currently. There are a
couple of VERY good bug tech info guys on this list (Dwayne &amp; Phil, just to
name a couple). Goto the following link to check it out:

Hope to see you there!
Peace, John Baker
