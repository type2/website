&gt;Sure, used galvanized mechanic's wire (baling wire would work), one
wire to
&gt;each upper door hinge and one to the bumper.

Aha! Of course! Just when you think you're not a newbie anymore
something silly like this comes along that you can't figger out for
yerself! :-)  Thanks, Ken!

 Of course it looks like hell
&gt;but if you saw the bus you would speculate that that might be the
whole
&gt;point of the excercise. 8)


Hey, it's a BUS, not a Ferrari! As long as it's on there, good enough
for me!  Happy Holidays!!!
