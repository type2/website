I thought Thom lived in or near the big Sac?  That's all I'm saying.  Thom
seems to have this reputation of once he starts a resto, it gets completed
(or close to it) fairly quick.  How long did that panel take?  2 weeks for
the outside and a week for the inside?  Seems like the campbox didn't take
that long either.  Ah, the joys of being single...

 WE HAVE THE DOGLEGS FOR $200.00 A SIDE REAR CORNERS FOR $200.00 A SIDE AND
A
 THE WHOLE FRONT NOSE CLIP FOR $500.00.  TAKE IN MIND THAT WE HAVE TO CUT
THE
 BUS APART.  A LOT OF LABOR.

 So that's

 (200 x 2) + (200 x 2) + 500 = 1300 for some parts?  I betcha Kelly could
 fabricate the pieces for less than that.  Granted it's not og, but that's
an
 awful lot for what?  Barndoor parts?  Are we gonna seen the '54 RHD Deluxe
 driving around the streets of Sacramento in about a week?

 Paul &gt;&gt;

I doubt it, very few buses drive around here in Sacramento.
