was writ:

Waited till friday to post this one.  I was in orange county a couple of 
 &gt;weeks ago, and ran into a nice bus owner, he was driving a late '63 kombi, 
 &gt;what I thought was interesting was that it had &quot;innie&quot; vents, but small 
back 
 &gt;hatch, fried egg turn signals, flip out front door handles.  The owner also 
 &gt;told me that it had the bigger later brakes.  I can only remember the first 
 &gt;three chassis #, 114 so I guess this bus was really close to the '64 
 &gt;changeover.
 
 and Taylor writ:

Actually, he's not the only one.  My '63 (1139075, July 3rd) has innie
 vents, small back window, fried eggs, and fridge handles.  I've only got
 bigger brakes and a big nut tranny because a PO put a '67 trans in at one
 time.  So yeah, I suppose it was a late '63 thing for a lot of us.  :)

........................................
switch to innie vents- 6 March 63  vin 1 080 104   (mid 63 model year)
small back hatch through   5 August   63 VIN 1 144 303  (all 63s had them)
fried eggs                    beginning of 62 model year (N American spec)
fridge handles through         18 dec 63     VIN 1 222 026  (early 64 models)

the later brakes was in the 1 ton suspension optional extra.  the 63 version 
has the little nut (36mm), but longer stub axles that take a wider drum that 
the regular 63 drum, and use the same brake shoes as 64-67.  unless it just 
had a later trans swapped in, like Taylor's bus.
