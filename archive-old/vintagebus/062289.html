Subject: Re: [VB] H5 vs B6 engine case


The H and B cases are horrible candidates to build up as a performance
motor.

Small oil passages, single relief, cruddy magnesium blend... Blah blah blah.

Splurge and get a newer case.  Used ones should be around $125 and new ones
$300ish.

********************************************************
I agree with Adrian,
Even if the metal alloy was tuff enough, Mains are softer,  and the oil
passages are too small. The best I would so with the older blocks would be a
mid performance motor with 90.5 and standard stroke (counter weighted of
course) 100 or 110 Engle with a center mount carb and 041 heads with
possible 1:25 to 1 rockers. I would put a thin line oil sump and external
cooler also to give you more cooling oil in addition to the 71 doghouse
cooler adapter 8mm-10mm seals.

Get a newer block, take your time and save for the good parts and then put
together a performance motor.
