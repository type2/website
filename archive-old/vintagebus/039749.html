Let me clarify... extended beyond type 2's


&gt;From: &quot;S Hedberg&quot; &lt;shedberg51_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt;
&gt;Subject: [VB] AIRS and Non-Type 2's
&gt;
&gt;A topic has been brought up on the vintageVW list that perhaps AIRS should
&gt;be extended to all air cooled vintage and perhaps non-vintage VWs.  One
&gt;thread had suggested an AIRS knockoff for non-type 2's in connection with a
&gt;trip that one member was taking across the Northern U.S. but it seems that
&gt;this is reinventing the wheel.  This type of logical extension or expansion
&gt;can only be good, to further the &quot;cause&quot;.  Any thoughts ?  Suggestions ?
&gt;Flames ?
&gt;
&gt;Is there ostracism on this list for going over the top or off the edge of
&gt;the civilized world?
&gt;
