The Hubcap Has  officially embarked on a new journey!
The Great Bus Tour has one more leg added to the journals as of today!

I waited for the torrential rains and the lightning to stop, and
contemplated canceling the trip... then  I was outside in my rain slicker,
cleaning out the downspouts that caused the flooding,,, THE SUN came out,.,,
I checked my email ,as it was safe to use the computer again, and found that
Phil was expecting me, things were set up on his end, and he had gone to
catch some shuteye as he just got home from work.

The Sun gave me the inspiration that I needed.

The event was somewhat uneventful, until I decided to detour off the
Highway, and drive the backroads of Southern Ontario!
The roads being freshly washed, and this area in a Harvest period, the smell
of hay was fresh in the air, there is a lot of potted plant, open field
nurseries that have the flowers ready for shipment, and just the general
slow life of Rural Ontario was real pleasing, This time of year has the
greenest grass,, and the tree's are real dark green, no pictures or words of
mine can describe it.
Either I am getting old or I have found that life IS better in the slow
lane!

Unfortunately I was able to drive right up to Phil's house,,, so I don't
have any interesting &quot;lost in Farmland&quot; stories.
Farmland, Rural, back roads, ,,these may portray a bit toward hillbillies,
but believe me,, there is just enough distance from large urban centers,
which can be seen by the massive new houses in the area!
This is a very nice town / area!

Well,, I arrived at Phil's about an hour earlier than planned,, I had left
time for &quot;expected&quot; things,, breakdowns,,,, wrong turns,, gas stops,, and
even though I slowed down to a crawl, I was there early.

I couldn't miss his driveway, I didn't even need his street number,, as soon
as I seen the &quot;Contraption&quot; I just pulled in right in front!

I think he heard the familiar noise of a VW engine as I was greeted long
before I could get out of the Bus!

Phil and I talked alot of things,, my trip,, our new tires, [conti's]
..buses,, blah blah blah,, and decided it would be great to have a swim!  It
was very warm!
I remembered to take pictures, so did Phil, as we just noticed the camera in
the Tour box........ But... slight dilemma as we had no one to take the
picture! ,,,,,,,, So phil ran to Pete, the neighbour and asked for
assistance.  Phew, that worked out great, and we all went for a swim!

I had commitments at home and planned on leaving after an hour or 2, but
Phil, Pete, Myself have alot in common and continued to Yak!, and swim!  He
offered a libation ,,,
Fortunately this caused me to stay late enough to meet Phil's wife, but now
it was time to get cracking, before I was REAL late!

As I was leaving, some friends stopped by and it didn't take much for me to
stop and show off the Watermelon!  I had to demonstrate my artistic ability
by &quot;painting&quot; the flowers on the Bus


With the magnetic signs I made!   All in great Fun, there is a bunch of one
line jokes, poked at the situation!

I had enough time to give Phil and His wife a Royal tour of the Watermelon,,
the &quot;penthouse&quot; and everything!!
then it was time to split,, I hi-tailed it home in 1 hr and 15 minutes,,
proving that The VW world is truly a small world!

Here's To The Fun!   Cheers!
