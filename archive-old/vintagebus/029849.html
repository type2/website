Subject: Buses and Harleys

 My old beat up '67 westy always gets compliments at the biker saloon
where I hang out.  We have several customers at the VW shop where I work
who own and operate both a bus and a Harley. And, of course, there are
the trike folks who belong in both camps.

The biker community has a &quot;brotherhood&quot; very similar to the bus
community, except older and considerably more established. Political
views tend to be slanted different ways between the two camps (I think),
and I don't really want to get that thread started, but both seem to
share libertarian views, and both take care of their own.

Just musing out loud... How much is a good middle seat from a '73 worth?
