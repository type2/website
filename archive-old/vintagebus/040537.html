If anyone is looking for parts for a travel equipment corp camper, I believe 
a guy in my area is using one for his parts bus.  The pop top is there, and 
looks to be in nice condition, I can't say about the interior, though.  If 
anybody replies maybe I can go check it out.  I didn't chime in sooner, but 
the Elkhart Indiana comment clicked something in my mind.  There's a tag on 
the side of the pop top that says travel equipment from Elkhart, IN.

Said bus is located in Salt Lake City, UT
