&lt;&lt; You wouldn't even need doctored papers.  Make up a bill-o-sale, go down to
 DMV, cry that the title was lost, pay some money, and now you have a legit
 title to a stolen truck.
 
 I recall a story about a bus that was stolen recently in SoCal that someone
 swapped the numbers in.
  &gt;&gt;
Depends on the state/situation. however, a title can be had for any car 
through mail order for $120. all you have to do is write the company a bill 
of sale &quot;selling&quot; them the vehicle and the send you a newhampshier (sp) bill 
of sale. Newhampshier doesnt have titles for cars made prior to some date in 
the early to mid 80s. So you get a ligitimate title.
