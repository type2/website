&gt;I have more than
&gt;once gone to a bus that sat for decades, and camped out for a couple of
days
&gt;and did such a thing and ended up driving 2 buses home.
&gt;
&gt;
Well, I've ridden two bicycles home without breaking my neck, but Clara  I'd
love to know your secret for driving two buses home.

This is a skill I could use ;-)
