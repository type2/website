Subject: Original Paint Dilemma

I have a 67 Pearl White camper that is 3/4 original paint. This bus was in an 
accident many years ago and had the 3 doors on the right side doors replaced 
(new factory when they were still available) and repainted. Over the years 
the repainted doors have  been slowly losing paint due to the inferior 
quality verses the factory finish. Also a couple of dings in that same area 
now require a small bit of body attention.

My problem is I love the original paint and I don't want to paint over it. Is 
it possible to address the needs of repainting the right side of the bus so 
that it can match? the other 75% of the original paint which is in remarkably 
good condition.

Can anyone out there guide me in this area. Body shops that may know? 
Unfortunately I live in North Texas so that also constricts So Cal expertise. 
Any and all input will be appreciated. Thanks.
