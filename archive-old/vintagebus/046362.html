Hi Volks,
Actually it is better to go by load range instead!  There are some LT radial 
tires that have lower load ranges than some P radial tires.  You really want 
at least 1500Lbs. and 1700 or 1800 or higher is much, much better.  
Especially in high sidewinds and/or when a semi passes you!
  Bias ply tires are nice and once one does get used to thier tendancy to 
follow grooves in pavement they work well.  Our main problem with bias ply is 
availability out on the road.  We have tried bias on one axle and radials on 
another axle on our SC and resulted in a sickening wobbly/wandering feeling 
and constant instant by instant steering wheel adjustment!   Eric&amp;Barb
