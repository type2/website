I Know that when I cruise my bug with the rack there is a small lose of power 
with it on, almost not noticeable. I have heard of full length racks taking a 
mile per gallon away on a bus. Word of warning I have run my rack on my bug 
loaded with junk and it does create a BIG wind drag. I mean my bug could not 
break 55 MPH fully loaded rack, it wasn't the weight just the wind drag.
