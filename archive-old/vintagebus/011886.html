&gt; Does anyone know of a good 6- or 8-ply siodewall rated tire in a *15*
&gt; inch?  Preferably 205, but 195 would also make me happy. 215, 225 will
&gt; NOT work. 

Well, here's a 195/70R15 load range D tire.  See:

http://www.sendelwheel_dot_com/n-850.htm

The bad news is that the OD of this tire is only about 1/4 inch larger
than a 185R14.
