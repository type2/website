I'm looking for an original Sigla rear window for my 63 deluxe too.  I measured the one in my bus and it is the same size as your hatch, so you do have the right rear hatch.  It sounds like you probably got a 64 and later rear hatch glass the first time and a non deluxe 62 rear glass the second time.  If no one else has a window to trace I guess I could pull the glass out of my hatch and trace it.  Let me know if no one else is able to send you one.

Richard
