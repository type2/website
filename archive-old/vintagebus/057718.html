Subject: Re: [VB] Daily Driver Poll/Bus Sighting :p

They are also extremely rare in northern Virginia.  I'm lucky if I see
another one (outside of the big VW show in Manassas) per year.  The last
I remember seeing was late summer of 2000.  I was driving the Beetle
convertible on an errand during my lunch break and came alongside a beat
up, working-class splitty doublecab, pearl white, driven by a couple of
grimy working class gentlemen.  We gave each other thumbs up and then
went our separate ways.

&gt; Split busses are VERY RARE around here. Because of me there are now a
&gt; few more in town. But none of those are even on the road right now.
&gt; And all my others are non-running too. So it's just my lonely '59. A
&gt; bus sighting is usually one driving through town. Very rare, but VERY
&gt; cool when I, or someone I know, sees one.
