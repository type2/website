would anyone be willing to tape together some paper and trace their kick =
panels, then fold it up and send it to me?  i am making interior panels =
for my 65 and have an old one of all panels except for the kick panels.  =
im also looking for a front door mechanism, the one that the interior =
handle attaches to.  i am willing to pay for this stuff or im always up =
for trading.  thanks!
