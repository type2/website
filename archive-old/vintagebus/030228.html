&gt; I am looking for something that will generate a stream of smoke (or smoke
&gt; like particles) for testing air flow. Preferably one with a wand or hose to
&gt; put the smoke right at the area of interest. I have an air leak SOMEWHERE
&gt; on the 70's 1600, and am not getting anywhere w/ the usual &quot;spray junk at
&gt; suspected spot and listen for idle speed increase / white smoke in tailpipe
&gt; / can of propane exploding in your hand :)&quot;  I have used incense sticks,
&gt; but they are not reliable...  I know building contractors use these to
&gt; determine leaks in HVAC systems, door and window jambs, etc.
&gt;
&gt; Would even go for a good set of ideas how to build one!
&gt;

I was going to offer use of my fog machine if you are local, but that would be a
BIT too much smoke.

I reread your post first thinking that you were looking for an air leak inside
the bus, then realized that you have an intake manifold leak.

Try WD40.  It comes with the little spray stick and can localize the leak to a
small area.  I have used starter fluid, but don't recommend that due to its
volitility.
