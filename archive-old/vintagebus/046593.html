&lt;&lt; Again the facts are 1600 DP 32/36 Weber Progressive 15 mpg in town &gt;&gt;
Hi Scott,
There are so many reasons for low MPG from not using a pressure regulator on 
a electric fuel pump, bad jetting,bad wheel bearings, too low of tire 
pressure, or too high of RPMs.  We just got back from Sacramento getting 22 
MPG instead of 24+ MPG apparently due to a leaky mecahnical fuel pump 
diaphram (Drat!) with our SP DR 1641cc engine in our 1960 panel .  Weather 
temps down there were in the mid 80s if not higher (Hey Thom how hot did it 
get down there officially?) and we were able to keep our oil temp below 210 F 
by keeping about 2,800 RPM with a 3.88 R&amp;P freeway flier with .82 fourth and 
27&quot; diameter rear tires and 30PICT-1 style of brazilian Solex carb with hand 
choke.  The fronts are a 25&quot; diameter and the speedo reading about 64-65 MPH.
  We used to get only 19 MPG in our 1963 SC (and simular readings in our 1960 
panel!) with stock geared tranny on the same trip and only get 19 MPG doing 
55 MPH 3,800 RPM with 25&quot; diameter tires all the way around and getting 
really low oil pressure (Oil idiot light blinking more on then off!) due to 
high engine oil temp with our big bore 40 HP SR engines in the mountains.  
Once we dropped down to 3,000 for a top cruising RPM and dropping to about 
2,800 RPM when the going got both steep and hot our MPH jumped to 27 MPG, oil 
pressure jumped up 10 Lbs. and dropped about 20 F with the stock 1960-63 
tranny.
