Subject: Re: Removing Speedometer cable from left front wheel

I am looking for one of these rubber sleeve seals that goes into the back of 
the spindle, where the speedometer cable enters. I have been unable to find 
one. Does anyone know a source, or have a spare one?

Is there anything inside the drum that holds the speedo cable in place? 
There
does not seem to be a connector on the back where it enters and I've
disconnected the cotter pin but I can't seem to remove the cable from the
back.  Any ideas?

Thanks
Dave

Hi Dave,
There should be a rubber sleeve-like seal to keep water from getting 
through
the innerside hole into the wheel bearings.  You should dig around  with a
screwdriver a bit to clean off old dried up grease, and still might need  to
just pull hard.
