&gt;I don't know how wide a 15&quot; wheel is but a 14&quot; is not 5.5&quot;
&gt;A wide 5 bug wheel is 4&quot; wide.
&gt;A wide 5 bus wheel up to 67 is 4.5&quot; wide.
&gt;A wide 5 bus wheel from 68 to 70 is 5&quot; wide.
&gt;Are you measuring from the outside lip to the outside lip?
&gt;You measure from inside edge to inside edge where the bead sits. 


I stand corrected.
