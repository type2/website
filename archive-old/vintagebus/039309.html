This morning's exchange about VW keys has been interesting. My '67 requires
two keys, one for the ignition and most of the doors, another for the
passenger side cargo door. The engine lid has a locking latch, but no key.

Is it possible to get them all singing in the same key? Who is the key
person to contact?

&quot;The one constant through all the years, Ray, has been baseball. America has
rolled by like an army of steamrollers. It's been erased like a blackboard,
rebuilt, and erased again. But baseball has marked the time. This field,
this game, is a part of our past, Ray. It reminds us of all that once was
good, and that could be again. Oh people will come, Ray. People will most
definitely come.&quot;
