Subject: Re: [VB] engine question

Cal,

This is quite the stumper.

Sounds like you've got a great, in-spec engine.

silly question:  does the noise change when you depress the clutch?

My guess is that the tapping is due to some metal expanding when the 
engine is hot, and something rubbing up against a rotating part.  Perhaps 
the pully or fan?  

Maybe a good test would be to warm up the engine until it &quot;taps&quot;, then 
shut it off.  With all senses fully alive, try turning over the engine by 
hand (well, with a wrench) and listen for any rubbing whatsoever.  Perhaps 
even going as far as taking off the belt for a second test and spinning 
the generator/fan.

Other possibilities: I assume it's not just your tail pipe vibrating with 
the engine and making the sound?  There are a number of potential places 
for it to rub, and I've had mine make quite a racket before.

Cheers,
	Tom
