it is aesbestos! the whole point is though you don't wanna disturb it by
rummaging around to find out if you guess is right. error on the side of
caution. aesbestos related health issues are very well documented. obviously a
cumulative thing is usually at the root of long term health issues but why not
error on the side of caution? and get those fibres floating all over the place
for you to breathe in. if memory serves vwoa had some obscure &quot;warranty&quot; to
exchange these for non aesbestos versions?? mebbe something in the archives??

m.

If you're looking for asbestos, take off the accordian tube that
connects the heater box to the duct.  Pull out the metal ring on the
end and check out the gray collar inside.  It sure looks like
asbestos to me.  The accordian tubes I've looked at came off a 71 Bus
and a 74 Beetle.

&gt;I sort of assumed perhaps blindly that due to the vintage and 
&gt;appearance
&gt;of all the krap that came out of the blanket and the construction of
&gt;the few bits of blanket that asbestos was used.
&gt;
&gt;I have no lab at my disposal or parts lists. However. I have learned 
&gt;my
&gt;lesson...
&gt;
&gt;1) Don't dive into a convo on a partial quote of the original message
&gt;2) wear a darned mask regardless.
&gt;
&gt;sorry all..
&gt;
&gt;dust bad...bad dust...
