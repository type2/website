Subject: Bus Birth Cert.

 Rec the birth cert on my 1956 bus the other day. Only took about 3 weeks to
get it. I sent a $20 bill with the letter and did not mess with DM
conversion. Beside the cert they also sent me an original 1956  bus catalog
from a dealer in the city in Germany where my bus was delivered to. Think it
is the original selling dealer. M codes were 113 ( safari windscreens for
export),  127 ( tailgate without a window) , 032 (locking fuel filler
cover), and the paint color was undercoat (primer only). Looks like all the
weird safari conversion work was done in Germany before bus was sent to
Africa. Looking for the locking stuff for the filler door as it is missing,
any out there? let me know. See you in Jerome this weekend.
