Does RB have an exclusive right to reproduce VW workshop manuals? 

This may seem far fetched but would it be possible to obtain permission from RB or VW to produce a &quot;vanity printing&quot; of the desired workshop manual. For Instance, Could NEATO (being a legal entity) obtain permission to license a reprint of the workshop manual through another publisher. Pick whatever vanity press you want. The cover might say NEATO commerative addition of the VW 195x workshop manual. To make it look even better to RB and or VW, NEATO could donate all the profits (yeah right) to a charity. I would guess 1000 or so could be printed. And sold through NEATO. 

Just a thought
Chris
