&lt;&lt; When one refers to the inside of the headlight buckets, I think of the

without headlights it would look like two buckets welded into the front nose

Hi Scott,
The official VW parts books list what you are talking about as a head lamp 
housing.  What we are refering to is the part that screws into the housing 
with one screw, and aims the head light bulb.  This item in the bus part 
books is simply named &quot;Headlamp&quot;, and the USA version &quot;Headlamp sealed beam&quot;, 
but out here in the NW USA it has been called a bucket.  Why we are not sure, 
but &quot;Headlamp&quot; makes one think of only the bulb itself.  Headlight bucket 
seems to work well.  Especially when it can be carried around by hand kind of 
like a bucket after only removing one screw.  Were is the head lamp housing 
would be a bear to take off your bus and carry around.   Eric&amp;Barb
