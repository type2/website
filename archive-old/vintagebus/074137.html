Subject: Re: [VB] H case oil pump w/filter

Hi JT,
The only way to find out is to remove the oil pump cover and compare the 
upper gear to a gear from a dished or non-dished pump.  Or just remove the entire 
oil pump and take a look at the cam gear.  Either way removal of the rear 
apron, muffler, lower pulley, and both pieces of rear engine tin is required.
