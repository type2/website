 so that i can grease them or will they seize first? &gt;&gt;
Hi Domonic,
The problem is that if the grease does not get to the bearing surfaces due to 
being too tight, water will.  This will cause rust which will possibly cause 
complete seizing.  If they do not freeze up they will wear out of tolerance 
all too soon from the abrasive iron oxide grit in them.
