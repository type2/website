Subject: Re: [VB] Two trips, not enough gears! (a littl long) / trip
  report (short)

bummer!!!!

FWIW, I just got back from BYOB/ Kelley Park.    Tranny still has all its 
gears, though I think shifting into 3rd is a tad sticky .   Todd Hill rebuild w/ 
~ 25K ??? on it

Stopped at the hotsprings last night on the way back, drove ~350 miles today. 
  Only bus problem was running out of gas 3 miles before the exit I was 
planning to take to get gas (had a can in the bus) For some reason reserve didn't 
work.  I did look at the rear brake shoes and adjust and bleed the brakes in 
CA, brakes really did need adjusting.  Anything to do w/ the mountains?   nah.

Oh, I didn't go to Crater Lake, but I heard there's 28 feet of snow up there, 
and a hole cut in it for you can climb up and see the lake through it.   Now 
that SNOW would be worth seeing

about 2100 miles round trip.   Did add 1/2 qt oil.

Great seeing you JP, and all the other listees who were at the shows last 
weekend

In the last two months, I've made two trips to
California for campouts, shows, and family business. 
Other than the price of gas and teething problems with
my new stroker motor, I lost a gear on each of two
transmissions on each trip!
