Al-
Plug the jets in and try it? I think you want to keep trying smaller
and smaller jets until you go too small (engine &quot;spits&quot; because it
isn't getting enough gas) and then go back up to the next larger size.
Probably the answer is trial and error, I don't think you can count on
the jet sizes that work in someone else's engine to work the same with
yours. I would try a 60 pilot first, if that still runs good then try
the 55. But check the stroke of your fuel pump first if you haven't, I
think too high fuel pressure can make the engine run rich despite
correct jetting. If you are having problems finding mains or pilot/aux
jets I can mail some to you, $2.50 each at the bugshop. They have
mains from 112.5 up to something huge like 180, pilot/aux from 45 to
65 in 5's. No air corrects/emulsions, but I am not that far into the
process.
Good luck,
Joel

Joel and listees,
All I have found so far is 115, 120s, 55 pilot...Do you think I could
go
with a 55 pilot, 50 aux, and 120 main? My plugs are brown at the
electrode area, slight black at the thread edges, I am close to begin
with, and these plugs got fux0red when I first ran the engine with the
old carb from hell. This week end wil see new plugs to diagnose
better,
but I am thinking just the pilot reduced might be fine for me....
Is a 120main 55 pilot (instead of 65) and  50 aux a possible
combination?&gt;
Still learning,
AL
