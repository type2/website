Subject: Crooked door and missing stop? Also wax question.

------=_NextPart_001_0000_01C24A94.0D9551A0

On my rear hatch the striker plate has an angle piece with 2 small screws=
 in it.  It does not come into contact with the latch.  Is there supposed=
 to be a rubber stop there?

Also it is off about 1/4&quot;, meaning the right side is almost touching and =
has rubbed a little on the top.  What would be the best way to correct th=
is?  Should I open it up and just really pull it over?  It is really hard=
 to close with the new rubber and I am thinking that is why its off, it u=
sed to be pretty straight with the old worn stuff, had a groove it went i=
nto.  If you pull on it before you close it, it lines up.

One more question.  Being that my bus is has not been color sanded and I =
want to drive a little.  Should I wax it to protect the new paint?  or is=
 it ok to drive as it, just need to keep it clean?

Thanks,

Bart Daugherty
