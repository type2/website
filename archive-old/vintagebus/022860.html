Subject: If it's not one thing it's another...
Mime-Version: 1.0


So I went down to the my LVWFLAPS (Pozzi's) and bought a new carb for the
bus, thinking that would help it's poor running.  Attempting to adjust the
mixture, I'd put the screw all the way in, and it wouldn't change the
running at all.  Hmmm.

So I put on the new carb  Varooom!  Runs like a champ!  Cool!   I drove
around, did some errands, saw some friends, got lunch, generally havin' a
ball.  Until on the way home, about 2 miles from my house, it seized.
%_at_&amp;*(__%_at_!%#_at_!  (*sigh*)  It's first tow, and I didn't have a camera with
me to capture the moment.   My new engine is supposed to be ready Friday
afternoon or Saturday morning.  I'm getting a 1600 SP, 200mm 6v flywheel,
new case, heads, yada yada yada.  I'm also going with a doghouse cooler,
and *heresy* I'm converting the bus to 12v!   Yes, I guess I'm outta the
closet.  I also bought a 12v Optima battery.

In other news, the steering is sloppy.  Decided to shop around for a new
box; the only places I knew of were Kymco, which didn't have them, and Bus
Boys.  $350 for a locking-column box.  And it turns out it's a brazilian
box, so you have to use a later (73+) pitman arm.  How much to send in my
box and have it rebuilt?  $350.  How much to rebuild a normal box?  $250.
Why?  No adequate explanation was forthcoming.  I need to learn how to do
this.  Any ideas where to get the bushings?  The actual problem is in the
&quot;output shaft&quot; of the box - that's where the slop is.  This is the second
one I've seen like this.  I'm wondering if this isn't a box that was
already rebuilt, possibly poorly, as all of the other sloppy ones I've seen
had the slop &quot;farther in&quot; in the box, and not in the output shaft.
