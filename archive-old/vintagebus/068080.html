Subject: Re: [VB] sunroofs and leakage

My friends used to love slogging around in my bus. I would hit a puddle
in the road - water would come up through the holes in the front
floorboard, up the inside of the windscreens, and get the driver and
passenger very wet. And if it was a big enough puddle, water would also
come in over the top of the bus, down through the sunroof area.
Everyone got wet. It was a lot of fun.

Of course, this did not make my rust problem any better. But my bus
seemed to enjoy the attention.

Who said deluxes aren't any fun!? ;-)
