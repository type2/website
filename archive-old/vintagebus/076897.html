I'll have to see if how much Brax will charge for a used unit and then figure

Hi Oly,
Eric's Sister has gone through three used trannies in the past two years.  
You might want to just have a rebuilt one done and that way have one less break 
down wild card in your bus, and alot less than a towing bill!  Plus the tranny 
should be shipped to your doorstep!
