The knob you refer to is the reserve tank.  When a bus driver is out of gas
(you'll know you're out of gas
when your bus sputters a whole lot and dies...heh heh heh) just pull that
knob and I think you'll have approx 
1 gal of gas left to get to a gas station.  Occasionally the reserve valve
needs to be rebuilt...not to hard though.
best of luck.
