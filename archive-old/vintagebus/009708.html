hey bussers,
I'm wondering if the procedure is the same
as the type 1 for raising the rear end of the bus. Anything 
different about doing this on a bus? Any tips?
I saw a description this in a recent issue of VW trends.
I've got a Westy with an SO34 interior so it's a little back
heavy, especially with the rack and enough food on board to
circumnavigate the globe. I would like to get about 2 inches of
lift back there just to even things out. Also, I was wondering
what the lifespan  is on the Boge shocks. Should a 37 year
old set be good or does the oil in them go bad after a time?
They seem to be ok with 35k miles on them. Just wondering 
if I should grab a set while they're hot. 

Larry
