Subject: Re: [VB] First meeting of North Carolina Bus Club
Cc: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

 From the frosty mid-west Neil reminds us that........

&gt;There is already a North Carolina bus club in existance.

True. The purpose of the group forming is to locally support 
(Triangle and Triad region) Transporter owners. The club is open to 
the entire range of Transporters. We will be meeting locally monthly 
and have quarterly inter-chapter socials (cookouts or picnics). We 
will also be holding local maintenance days and worming our way into 
small town Xmas parades :)

I plan to proudly continue my membership in NEATO and hope to find 
others to join that group.
