Subject: RE: [VB] The Bus Depot's &quot;economy brake parts&quot; anyone tried 'em

 More then likely TVS/India,  none of my importers/suppliers carry this
brand anymore. A lot of times you will find TRW and Bendix wheel cylinders
are TVS or LPR (italy). I have had to warrenty to many TVS and LPR's for my
liken and have discontinued selling these brands. 1 warrenty and your profit
is down the drain.

ps. I have always felt my life is worth more then a few cents and rufuse to
sell anything I wouldn't use myself

Subject: [VB] The Bus Depot's &quot;economy brake parts&quot; anyone tried 'em


Was looking for brake parts &quot;on the cheap&quot; for the
beater `66 s-c and saw bus depot has economy wheel
cylinders for like $6.95...wow that is cheap...my
question is has anybody used these with decent
results...? 

Also anyone know what brand these are?  It says
India-China.  I have used the India brand BI TVS years
ago and they were great....just wondering if it is the
same stuff. I emailed the depot but have not heard
back yet.

thanks
