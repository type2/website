Subject: Torque Spec Question
Date: Fri, 30 Jun 2000 13:07:03 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I was wondering if anyone knew what the torque spec was for the little screw
terminals on the taillight housings on a 58 Binz?  When I was down at Dan's
working on his Binz, I was messing around with the tail lights and for the
life of me, I couldn't find the spec _anywhere_ in the Bentley manual.
Anyone have any page numbers or references for those terminals?

Thanks for the help!
