I guess it depends on the AR factor.  I'm content to do mine in
Krylon &quot;Battleship Gray&quot; which is a little bit lighter, but adheres very
well.

Go to the gas tank section of my howto page to see a comparison.

&gt; Does anyone have a good modern day source for the grey paint originally used on the gas tanks?  Is it flat?  Seems to be, but then again flat paint normally tends to show grease, oil stains and this paint doesn't seem to do that, especially considering where it is.  Rather than search through every paint store looking for something close, I thought I'd see if someone else has done that leg work.
