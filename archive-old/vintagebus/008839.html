&gt; oh yeah, and the bright spot of light i'd get on my resume by working at
the second job also factored in.  after i put in my time there i'll be able
to go anywhere!  i figure in three years time my truck and my cabrio will be
ready for the road in a serious way.  by that time the shop owner will
probably be retired anyway and maybe, just maybe i'll be ready to fly solo
with my vw maintenance.

I'm starting a retirement home for aged VW mechanics at my house...
maybe you could give him my number...?
