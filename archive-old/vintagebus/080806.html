Subject: Re: [VB] Thanks for the starter help... and brakes

Oops! Looks like you've already done that! My mistake.

I&quot;ve had all these symptoms happen to me several times around over the
years. Have you replaced your brake fluid recently, and have you
meticulously bled your brakes all around?  Brake shoes are dry? No fluid
leaking onto them? Brake shoes fit into drums evenly, not just in the
middle or on the ends? What's the condition of the drums? Smooth or
ridged? Pitted out? Brake systems on buses are crazy. Anything can cause
major problems. Squeaking is often caused by brake fluid leaking onto the
shoes. Sometimes by misaligned or mis-shaped shoes.

It occurs to me you could possibly have a wheel bearing on the side that
pulls going out - starved for grease, or worn out. I've had that happen
once, a long time ago.
