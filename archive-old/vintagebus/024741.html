Veronnica,

Glad to hear you made it. Even towing a Bus could be disastrous... glad
you missed the record winds we had a couple weeks ago (110 MPH at the
marina... dismasted a couple boats). It would have been a shame to
damage the body on your bus... our winter salt monster really prefers
eating virgin steel! :)

I think a quick note on a successful trailering is good, it would have
gotten old if you had given the Expedition's mileage &amp; oil temps though!
:)

I'll look forward to seeing you around town, good to have more Utah
representation on the lists!

&gt; For those of you that care, my baby made it out to Salt Lake City.  I
&gt; trailered her from San Francisco, CA to Salt Lake City on a flatbed trailer
&gt; using my nifty new Ford Expedition.  It towed great and she was a saint -
&gt; although it took 16 hours to get there!  Thanks to all who provided
&gt; trailering pointers.  Now, I just need to get there and it will be all good
