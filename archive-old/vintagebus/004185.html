Is this the same bus that was on its rims in Macon in kind of the rough part
of town? I almost bought it about six months ago but was moving, glad to see
that someone saved it, good luck.

&gt; Well today I worked on the Westy's somewhat thrashed electrical.  Now all
of
&gt; the turn signals work (except for the one and it IS a hack job ;-)) and
&gt; hazards, instrument lights, and the headlight relay clicks with the
brights but
&gt; no headlights ever come on.  That's for tommorrow, along with the amazing
&gt; three-wires-into-one right rear light.
&gt;
&gt; I also got my locking steering column switch working.  The screwdriver
operated
&gt; bay-bus switch screwed into the dash really bothered me, so I messed with
my
&gt; nifty non-working one.  The electrical component is fine (so is the spare
I got
&gt; from Dave Raistrick for two bucks, dude I owe you a beer or _something_)
but
&gt; the tumbler was immobile.  Dump some graphite in there, bam, it works with
the
&gt; rusty crusty original key!  Problem: I can't get it to stay in again!  The
&gt; Bentley says to push the switch in while turning the key, and the spring
will
&gt; click back into place.  I do this, but no clickie and no stay innie.
Anybody
&gt; with one of these (I think '67 only option, earlier non-removable?) got a
&gt; suggestion for me?  Another swell as hell thing is that the locksmith is
&gt; making me copies of my rusty key based on the code on the lock cylinder.
Now
&gt; all I need is a good '67 cargo door handle to have rekeyed, and I will
have a
&gt; one key bus.  Anybody got a good handle for me?
&gt;
&gt; I dumped some gas in the fuel tank to clean it out, pulled the bolt out of
the
&gt; hose, nothin'.  Pulled the hose.  Nothin'.  She's clogged, so I pulled the
tank
&gt; out.  I plan on cleaning it with the pressure washer this weekend.
&gt;
&gt; I removed all sorts of PO type stuff from the bus today too.  Yards of
taped
&gt; up wiring, an ignition coil bolted to the roof of the engine compartment,
a
&gt; couple lights, a vacuum gauge and associated 15' of hose, and an external
oil
&gt; cooler.  And some switches and their wiring.  And some other stuff.  It
makes
&gt; the wiring look less hopeless, but there's still stuff not working and
some
&gt; suspicious hanging wires that look disappointingly spliced-yet-stock.  And
man,
&gt; the wiring in the engine compartment is simply just plain NASTY.
&gt;
&gt; Remaining things I'm not sure about are how to test the oil and gen light
&gt; circuits without an engine and being uncertain of what is what, given the
&gt; condition in the engine compartment (ideas?), and how to get off those
&gt; fugly air scoops.  There's this really attrocious set of fiberglass scoops
on
&gt; my Westy.  I'm not sure how they're on, they look riveted one second, then
they
&gt; look bondoed, then they look 'glassed...maybe all three.  Ideas here would
&gt; be appreciated, keeping in mind I can't afford paint for probably a while.
&gt;
&gt; More work to do on Friday!  After classes :-(
