I'll take any non-lemerz ones dated 55-57.
I'll be in Washington two weeks form Saturday.
Yes, different suppliers.

&lt;&lt;$25 a wheel is what I have settled on. The range is from surface rust and 
dirty to primered in DP40 and painted black. Hubcap clips vary widely. Any 
wheels that I would sell have no curb damage and appear round. They all would 
restore beautifully. I have some interest but no definite sales yet. So let 
me know. I do need to
check on shipping for one person and hope to do that today. Has anyone 
discovered the difference in crows foot and non crows foot rims? Were they 
just different suppliers?
thanks
