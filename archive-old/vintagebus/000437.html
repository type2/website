 My '55 has a floppy hand brake lever which isn't attached to the cables. I
 spoke with a guy over the weekend who told me of his recent hydraulic brake
 failure ('58 SC) and his hand brake wasn't working! This story convinced me
 to fix my handbrake immediately. I crawled underneath the bus and found the
 problem. The two cables are dangling out of the conduit tubes, they have no
 retaining nuts on the threaded ends. Before I started digging through my
 nuts and bolts jar, I wanted to make sure the cables would reach the
 equalizer as they appeared to be short. I used a pair of vise grips to pull
 on the cables...no movement on either cable. I assume one of the previous
 owner failed to measure his new cables against the old set, and re-installed
 shorter cables. After threading the cables through the tubes, maybe he
 noticed his mistake and said f*ck it, and left the problem to a future
 owner? Just a guess, but I can't think of any other scenarios.
 I've never installed this cable, so I thought I would get the list's opinion
 on what to do next.
 Should I buy a new set of cables and re-install?  Could these be the correct
 cables and there is an incorrect adjustment in the rear wheels causing the
 lack of slack?
 If your opinion is to buy new cables, do you have any tips on threading the
 cable through the tubes....please say it isn't a royal pita to get the
 cables to the front of the bus :-)
 Thanks guys.

it is not hard to replace bus brake cables.  But it is a pita to get the 
right ones for early buses.   ch # 20-117 902 to above CH # 502 000 or so  is 
what you want - ones from a 67 which go up through the floor dont cut it, 
they are too long.  as yours are too short IO wonder if they are bug?   maybe 
you r levers in wheels are stuck?  you should be able to pull it somewhat, 
know what I mean? 

  One broke on my early 59 i had in 92 or 93 and at that tiome a new cable 
was $35 for that range, and $10 for the later ones.   I hear they are more 
expensive eekk eek   need those hand brakes working.As I had previuously had 
a brake rubber hose pop losing all hydraulic brakes, and had had athe hand 
brake then I wasted no time in hieing myself to a junkyard and wrestling a 
brake cable out of a fifties bus.
