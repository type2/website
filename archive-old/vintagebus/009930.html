 &gt;if
&gt;you transfer ownership, and pay registration due, dmv computers do not
&gt;require proof of insurance. i have slipped this through a few times. this
&gt;only works if you are transfering title though. just a tidbit relating to
&gt;importing, title, etc.
&gt; also this is a California thing


Works in AZ too as well as a few other states. Don't forget to go for the 2
year tag deal though, cause months later, DMV will do an automatic run on
your tags and realize it's still not insured, and cancel your registration.
Of course it doesn't matter cause the purpose of this is for your VW to look
good with tags while sitting in your driveway broken down and fend off those
neighbors everyone is bitching about.Then after 2 years passes and your
ready to REALLY insure it and drive it, you just say it hasn't been running
which is &quot;why you *cancelled* your insurance&quot; and everything is fine.
