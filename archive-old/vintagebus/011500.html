Hi all,

Within the last year or so I seem to remember reading a tech article 
with photo's or illustrations on how to take apart, install a new seal 
and reinstall the split windshield Bus overhead air vent &quot;flap&quot;.  I'm 
not sure whether it was a club newsletter or a VW magazine, but if 
anyone remembers, please let me know which and what issue.  
During the restoration of my '59 Double Cab, I've got my flap out 
and now apart.  My seal was pretty much non existant so I need to 
replace it.  I'll be bead blasting the flap halves, and the article talked 
about rivets and who supplies the flap rubber seal (WCM, I believe), 
etc.  Anyone already do this job and have any helpful tips?

Thanks,

Bill Bowman
