Subject: Busses by the Sea   FINAL INFO!!!

Everything is going as planned.  This weeks tragedy has not changed
anything.

Im all packed up and will arrive at the campgrounds around 10a.m. tommorow
to meet the new arrivals.  If im out scouting about Im sure Dave Parsons
will be around as well.  Look for the split windows down by the water.  Mine
is white over light blue and Daves is full cream.  I may also have a brown
84 westy down there as well.
Please bring extra firewood for the group fire if you can.  

Attendance is looking great, I cant wait to meet all the new faces this
year.

I can be reached by phone at 410 208 0140 this evening or my cell at 443 497
3171 for any questions or concerns.  I will also be getting my email tonight
and tommorow morning and will answer as many questions as i can.

The campsites # is 410-641-0880... just tell them your with the bus group
and they can also help you with directions or any other questions.   You do
not need reservations~!

Happy Trails,
