Hello all,

   Hey, I was wandering around Yahoo his morning and found this site
about a company  that makes a fiberglass kit to turn a bay into a split
window..............I about fell over. What is that all about? I mean at
that point you might as well chop the top 4 inches and put a lift kit on
the bus too.........Has anyone out there seen one of these KUSTOM buses?
I would like to see one up close.......... Hey i wonder if they have a
kit so I can convert my bus to a bay window or better yet a
Gremlin..............WOW! Well to each their own and all, but doesn't
that seem just a bit weird? Oh well, maybe it's just
me....................Everyone enjoy the rest of their weekend and Happy
Holidays!......See Ya!

Shawn
