John, I would certainly appreciat that!  From the descriptons that I'm getting
(Chris Hobbs), it isn't &quot;J&quot; shaped at all, but a straight tube that goes in at
an angle through that oval hole in the rear small tin piece.  Then the paper
hose goes through the tinware on top and bends at an angle to meet the tube. 


Yeah, if you have time, that would be cool

Thanks

I'm all for making one... Does anyone have a picture of one so I could get
some idea of how to start?

Thanks all
