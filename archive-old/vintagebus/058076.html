&gt;Nice job on that dog leg! It's good to hear that paint can hold out for that

It actually doesn't! My paint was in my shop with up and down weather of 
Texas. I shook it up real good before opening. I stuck a stir stick in the 
can and felt some hardened goo at the bottom. I went ahead and used the 
liquid that was there and it seems to have worked fine. But I wouldn't 
count on it still being good. And that's one of the reasons I wanted to get 
it done quick. I am glad what I had was usable though.
