Subject: Re: [VB] Source for ceiling panels

Anyone ever used the Foam insulation.  Seems that would be better and not
hold moisture.

&gt; Be careful if you are using home insulation on a bus.
&gt; I have a remarkably rust free midwest bus that I am
&gt; restoring.  The only major rust was in the doors and
&gt; it was caused by moisture held in by the pink
&gt; fiberglass insulation.  Any insulation should be
&gt; attached to the inner door panels and not the metal.
&gt; I know that you are interested mainly in the ceiling
&gt; panels but I thought that I should give you a word of
&gt; warning anyhow.  INSULATION BREEDS RUST!

&gt; &gt; Hey,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Does anyone have a source for the ceiling panels
&gt; &gt; above the driver and
&gt; &gt; passenger seats?  If nothing else, I am looking to
&gt; &gt; get the correct
&gt; &gt; dimensions for them(maybe a pattern?), so I can make
&gt; &gt; them myself.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I am in the process of putting insulation up in the
&gt; &gt; ceiling to guard against
&gt; &gt; the elements.  Right now to guard against the
&gt; &gt; Florida heat, but I want to
&gt; &gt; insulate against colder climates.  I went to the
&gt; &gt; Depot and picked up a roll
&gt; &gt; of pink panther insulation, and I have the rear
&gt; &gt; sections all figured out.
&gt; &gt; The next challange will be the cab.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Any help appreciated! - Kevin
