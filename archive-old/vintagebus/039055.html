Subject: Custom Wood Panels for Single Cab
Date: Tue, 11 Jan 2000 10:37:24 -0600

Anyone who wants to see my home-made wood door panels for my 58 single cab,
here's where to go:

These are made of &quot;luan door skin&quot; from Home Depot ($6 for 5x7 sheet).  I
didn't have any panels in Zorm to use as templates so I had to eye-ball
everything.  I warped the panels to fit the necessary curves by wrapping the
areas with a hot, wet towel (you can see on the back driver's side roof
panel where I tried to bend it too quickly and cracked the damned thing, but
not too bad).  Sanded them down and stained them front and back.  $20 and 8
hours later, that's what they look like.  And since I made them myself and
they were cheap, I didn't even mind cutting the holes for the speakers.
