does anyone have any tricks on freeing stuck valves in car??
On my 36horse 3 intake valves arent seating. the stems seem to 
be hanging up in the guides ..I'm just dreading pulling the engine 
back out and tearing it down for a valve job before I even know if it's 
anygood(was sold to me as a 60,000mi original been sitting for a 
long time though)

thanks
