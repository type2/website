O.K. fellow listees,heres your chance to get rid of those &quot;Extra&quot; parts
you've got laying around your garages. I'm going to be working in the
Chicago area (Hardware Show at McCormick Place) from Aug 11 thru Aug 20 and,
if you've got anything that may help me turn my '66 panel into a &quot;Camper&quot;
I'd love to hear from you.
    Right now, the van is totally empty so, I need anything I can come up
with ( the cheapoer the better &lt;G&gt;).

Jon
