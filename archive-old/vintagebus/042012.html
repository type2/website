&gt; Choke Adjustment
&gt; 
&gt; My bus stall when the oil get to a temp. around 30 degress celcius (when
&gt; it
&gt; just got hot).
&gt; 
&gt; I have try to adjust it between the 3 marks. It seems that the best result
&gt; are a little further down that the lowest mark. I have also changed the
&gt; choke, it helped a little. The idle got better, but it still stall.
&gt; I live in the mittel of the city so it pretty annoying.

This sounds suspiciously like the carb icing weve been discussing the last
couple of days. The choke adjustment should fall within the marks, I know
it doesnt seem like much adjustment but even that much can make a big
difference. 
I think you should be looking at preheat hoses and risers for a cure.
