After reading the wonderful book entitled OCTO &amp; Classic, words fail
me...  ooops, that's how I did book reports in 6th grade.

What a great weekend! 200+ splits at OCTO, parts galore, then the
Classic with more(?) splits and parts galore +. My '64 DC wasn't ready
for the trip and wouldn't be hurried. It taught me a lesson in
procrastination.... &quot;you coulda been doin this stuff last winter&quot; was
what I heard from the engine, windows, wheels and the hundreds of other
bits.
Our caravan was Karl (legendary parts fetcher from the type2 list,
aufever_at_webtv_dot_net) in a '77 Westy and Craig in Rosie the Rocket Sled. We
passed a couple of split Kombi/campers on 99, but didn't get in
formation. We were holding 70+ waiting for Rosie's oil temp to stay in
line in the 90 degree heat. Surprisingly the Westy dropped to 50 or less
on the killer Grapevine grade, 200' to 4144', while Craig zoomed past.
His oil temp on his 2100cc dropped going uphill. Ruminations throughout
the weekend pointed to the weight difference of about a ton between the
'63 DC and the Westy.  The Achilles' heel of the trip was Karl's
throttle cable. After 250k miles, it was polite enough to fail; off the
freeway after a gas stop, and let us coast into a nice neighborhood for
the repair.
OCTO was amazing, well planned and executed. Plenty of friendly workers,
efficient parking and layout. We met plenty of listees, but never found
Robert Davis. Talked to two groups there who had stopped by the Long
Beach meet. They reported 25 or so buses at 9 a.m. An 'official' count
quoted at the Classic was a total of 47 vehicles!
The brew pub gathering had the Elliss', Kate &amp; Matt(?) from LA, Karl,
Craig, Chuck from Lompoc and another crazee guy from Arizona in the
rustybus. We'll do that again next year, maybe in the hotel parking lot
with a homebrew keg, or at the campsite. Chuck reports that went well
despite the last minute change from O'neill to Irvine Lake. We missed
the toy &amp; literature show.
Classic? Words fail me...
