Subject: NICE Shifter extension for sale 
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com


During my unexpectedly extended period of under-employment I decided to put 
some of my manufacturing knowledge to good use.  I have reproduced the 
accessory double bend shift extension.  They are made of aluminum alloy and 
are polished to a chrome like finish.  I will be selling these on Ebay and I 
am sure they will go for &quot;stoopid&quot; money as those who follow Ebay can verify. 
 I want to offer them to the list folk at a non-Ebay price,  $25 each which 
*includes* shipping.  This is about 1/3 - 1/2 of what they fetch on Ebay.  
Though not shown in the picture, each will include the correct nut for 
tightening the extension into the proper position.

I do not recommend the double bend extension for the earlier (pre '59?) 
shifters which rotate.  I am making some single bend extensions which work 
better for this application.

Thanks,
Dan
