ok.... My story:  I was driving around, went to a game, then to Pizza Hut it was all fine.  I left the Hut to get something and I got to the market and it wouldn't start.  No Battery what so ever. So I popped it, but my head lights wouldn't work.  I couldn't do anything at that time, so I went back to pizza hut and ate with friends.  It wouldn't start again. So a popped it.  Drove down town (this is like 12:30 at night) and got pulled over because I had no lights.  
	I looked down and saw that one of my wires was disconnected from my High/Low Switch, and in fact it was, this was enough of an excuse for the Cop for my lights to be off.  I got out and checked and the lights were on.  When I got back in bus died.  It didn't respond to the gas pedal.  
	After my Breathalizer I popped it again (with no help from the cops.)  And turned the lights on and the van started to die as it did before. I just sat and idled it charge the battery.  Everytime I turn on the high beams lights the van dies instantly.  With the low beams I have about 30 seconds before it starts to die.  I can have the pedal to the floor and turning on the lights put a lot of stress on the engine.  I also don't have any electrical what so ever.  I limped it home with my mom behind me with her flashers on.
	I went out to the bus today. the head lights work fine (with the van off).  When I turn the key and I don't think I hear anything.
