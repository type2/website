&gt; Got my first issue. Very similar layout design and content to 
&gt; Volksworld. 

I bet they'd be amused to hear that as it's published by Volksworlds big UK
rivals, Total VW :)

&gt; I think the magazine itself was kind of a disappointment (unless you 
&gt; like late models), and the last 10 pages of the magazine were printed 
&gt; upside down?

I thought the paper was a bit flimsy, including the cover - and in terms of
models I guess for at least the first issue they have to put in a bit of
something for everyone - I know the guy in the letters page who asks why the
VW LT van isn't included as well - and I suppose if you're going to put in
wasserboxer wedge buses, why not LT's? I took a sub on the first 4 issues
(10GBP), so I'll be interested to see how it pans out.

As for the upside-down I think that was a large advert for the main sponsor
- Just Kampers - and I know some people have had complimentary copies sent
out from them.

Anyway, Happy New Year from the UK - I'm having a party at my house if any
of you are passing :)
