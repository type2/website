Hey All,

Would love to have some feedback on this subject.  Seems like it never gets 
any replies.  I've been wanting to do some empi 5s and have checked the 
archives and all I can gather is Eagle USA made empi's are the best and that 
they will fit the rear bignut with some shimming or something.  Everyone 
else I've pmailed w/ empi's on their bus usually have a IRS coversion or 
something not kickin RGBs.  I found repro BRMs and Sprintstars w 5x205mm for 
$195 each at http://www.wolfsburgwarehouse_dot_com/  Just my 2 cents...if 
anybody knows anything I'd like to read it!

&gt;&lt;&lt; Hello there...
&gt;  How would one go about mounting non stock rims such as empi 5 spokes to
&gt;  a bus?  Are there problems with putting them on the rear wheels of a big
&gt;  nut tranny?  Are there problems with the center caps or anything?  Are
&gt;  there any offset issues with the rims that would pose a problem putting
&gt;  them on a bus?

&gt;
&gt;And would the same thing go for Raders? Theres a set on ebay I might be
&gt;interested in? But thought I would ask before spending all that money.
