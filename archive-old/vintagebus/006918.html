I just got my copy of Total Vw from England, on the cover is Kock's old
Deluxe Limo which now resides in Belguim, the interesting thing is in the
artical about the bus it talks about the owner ( Bob from BBT, the largest
VW parts supplier in Europe) other VW's, it mentioned he had a 55 double Cab
Type 2, I wonder if it's a Barndoor or a post Barndoor bus or a year
missprint ? Somewhere on the web there is a web site of his warehouse with
all of his collection, I'll try to find it again and see if it's there.
