Subject: Re: [VB] Belt-eating crank pulley

hello John  How ya doin well I hope  I would take some sandpaper and a stick 
, start the engine and clean the pulley with the sandpapper on the stick into 
the groove of the pulley.  If you do  change the pulley you can either use a 
puller or take a chisel and tap on the inside of the backside of the pulley.  
The bolt torques to 33 ft-lbs . Also check and make sure that the generator 
pulley is in line with the crank pulley, some generators are longer than others  
later and have fun  Mark Dearing
