Hi Greg,

Great speaking to you today.  As I mentioned we're a small
film/production company in Toronto searching for a VW mini bus (hippie
bus) for a TV infomercial we're producing for a client of ours. The
infomercial is promoting a  10 CD box set music collection called
Flower Power &quot;The Music of the Love Generation&quot; We are shooting May
8,9,and 10th in Toronot0, indoors, at the CBC stduios on John Street.

We would like to find a splity, any shape, without the camper on top,
(more the way hippies used thme in the 60s' and the more psychedellic
the colors the better)....

If you can send this out to your contacts that would be great.  If
anyone is interested have them email me a photo
of the mini bus as we need to make final decsions by Tuesday. The
selected person will be compensated for the rental of their mini bus.


You can reach me at 416-709-3258...
