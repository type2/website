I got a copy of Microzine and a copy of Splitzine in case i'm stuck at a light
too long, a bobbing head dog, air pressure gauge, some nuts and bolts that are
so rusty that you wouldn't have known unless I just told you, pair of shades,
tattoo magazine, an extra parcel tray, dice caps, bearings, pieces of rust,
map to all the local junk yards, breath freshener, hair grease (doubles for
bearings), my Elvis glasses that was a gift before the bus show, fuses, camera
sometimes, door handle, and finally a 1600 long block!
