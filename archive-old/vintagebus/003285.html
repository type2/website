Harry,

I think what you have there is a little number from Kamper Kits in San
Jose. My DD delivery was built out by them. Yours is only the second
one besides mine that I have seen. The tip off is the width of the
side coat cabinet with the mirror. It is a little narrower than what
everyone else put in. You will find that you can slide a 4' x 8' sheet
of what ever into the rear hatch by slightly tilting it as it goes in.
Next time your down in LA area, stop by and take a look at my bus.
Unfortunately, about 20 some odd years ago I removed the rear facing
seat and the ice box cabinet due to the rot. I did keep all the other
paneling and the fold down seat.

Chris

&gt; I just posted 4 pics of my '66 WT kombi on www.thesamba_dot_com/vw under
Campers.
&gt;
&gt; The wood is really thin, cabinet missing behind passenger seat.
Sliding door on rear cabinet, z-bed of some kind. Rear mattress is
glued down, but looks like it has newer upholstery.
&gt;
&gt; Let me know what you think it is. I looked at every camper at BBBV
and didn't see one of this type or quality (or lack of quality.)
There's a few gouges and dents in the woodwork.  I have other plans
for the vehicle unless it's a rare spruce-goose companion camper or
something. The woodwork will be available at OCTO next month.
&gt;
&gt; BTW, I need wipers, outside mirrors, belly pan and pedal pan for my
FM 23 Window. Hmmm, with great detailing and quality pictures, it may
take $8,000 on E-bay, &quot;as-is&quot;? Just need some 1/25th scale Dead
stickers and a throw-down account.
&gt;
