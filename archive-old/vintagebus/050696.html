Subject: More New stuff

   I jusy got in corner window inner frames for those of you that want to
convert to a corner window bus or to repair that rusty inner channel.
  I also just got in replacement corner window glass (with the VW logo
upside down, go figure) and skylight glass.

  Coming soon, skylight inner frame pieces (repair those rusty ones).
