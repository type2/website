Subject: Re: [VB] upright motor and 78 tranny !

I've got a 1600 dual relief engine and late bay tranny in my 66 Splittie.
The transmission is a tight fit and has a wrap around juke on the front
just behind the end selector cover.
I've see several like this so I'm sure its part of a kit.
Think I'd try AA Transaxle

Anyone out there ever try anything like that? His only problem were the 
 motor  mounts--Seems a 78 tranny is a little longer--! , TWWM, uj
