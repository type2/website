Subject: Listee stranded-needs help!!

I just received a call from Jason Upper and Mick
McQuilton who are traveling from Aspen to Reno and are
broke down near Ely Nevada. It seems that Jason's new
engine from Jake raby has broken a rocker stud and
pulled the other.
Does anybody know anyone in the area who might be able
to assist them with anything?
their cell number is   970 948-6198
They are going to try and make it to Ely and figure
out what to do next.


My number is  775 677-0437
