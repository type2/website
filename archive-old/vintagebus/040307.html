Mmmm,

I was thinking pretty much the same.  BUT
I was going to roll some 1/2&quot; strip and weld
it to the end of the bar stock.  Put 2&quot;
(1/4&quot; wall thickness) pipe through this loop
and then weld hitch to tube (with braces etc etc).

i.e., then I have a hitch that will allow some
vertical movement, like a hinge really.  Or is
this overkill?

i just finished welding up a tow bar and
have a suggestion: the frame rails is the
right place to start, but do not use the
original bumoer brackets. they are sheet
metal, and will not support a tow bar.
i used 3/8 X  2  bar stock, and drilled out
the 10mm bolt holes to accomodate 1/2 &quot;
bolts. on the driver side you will run into
interference with the steering box and the
clutch pedal, so i left those two bolt holes
( factory nuts welded to frame) alone and
added two more 1/2 &quot; holes.
the new supports are welded to  a pair of
short pieces of bar stock at the angle of the
bumper mount plates, and bolted to a 40&quot; piece
of 1/2 &quot; bar stock which was bent in two places
to accomodate the curve of the bumper and
can be left in place with the bumper installed..
it is simple enough to unbolt the bumper and
install a tow bar with a couple of angle brackets.

i personally would not choose to tow with a piece of
lawn furniture like those other bars seem to be.
(john yust is dyslexic, i will be giving him back-up
lessons in a couple of weeks 8^)
