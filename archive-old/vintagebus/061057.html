&gt; no dude i was wrong its all new. thats with heater boxes, header system,
&gt; doghouse cooler, muffler, shipping, and its turn key. but i just found
&gt; out i can get a brand new one from btlmex for like 2100...still shopping
&gt; my thougghts tho

It is confusing, but some folks say that there is a difference between
Beetlemex and other suppliers.  The gist is that the Beetlemex engines
are
assembled from parts in the aftermarket while the engines sold by Ronnie
are factory-built engines in the original VW-Audi cartons.

Of course, no &quot;turnkey&quot; engines will be available from VW de Mexico, as
their production is fuel injected these days.  Apparently the FI parts are
rather pricey.
