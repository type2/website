Quick question.  I'm putting my cargo door seals in.  I was sent nine pieces 
for it, so I put four on one door and three on the other, because the left 
one seals against the right.  This leave two seals.
Now for my question, does the long seal above the cargo doors on the body go 
from end to end (bout three ft.), or does it stop about a cm before the 
ends.  I looks like it would stop, because the side seals on the doors need 
to fit in there.
Sorry if this doesn't make any sense...kinda tought to explain.  I can give 
you any info you need.
Thanks,
