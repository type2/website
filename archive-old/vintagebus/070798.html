Subject: RE: [VB] Front Trans Mount Q

Id say to look at any 'pre load' of your trans.  I think I've placed and
removed the trans in the double cab over ten times now fitting different
things and looking into the narrowed rear spring plate project and I
have really come to realize that you shouldn't have to force the thing
to fit nicely onto all three trans mounts, i.e. if you have to push and
pull on it or 'pull it into place' with the mount bolts, something is
wrong.  Get everything in place and then start tightening up all three
mounts equally.

... also, I don't see why you couldn't replace the front mount as long
as the motor wasn't in.  Just loosen up the front mounts and trans
support bracket, pull it forward a bit and replace.



Good luck!

David

1) is there a source for *good* front mounts?  I replaced
mine recently - about a month ago - and the new one already
broke!   

2) anyone ever replace the mount without removing the transmission?
