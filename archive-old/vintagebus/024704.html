Check your dealers for Kats brand heaters. I don't know if they still
make the one I've got, but it's designed to bolt to the oil sump on a
Type1 engine. I'm not using it right now, but I can't part with it until
I come to my senses and quit driving old VW's or move to warmer climes.
I don't expect either to happen soon! :)

I would go out and get you the part number, but I would have to cross
the frozen tundra to the garage! I just got in from thawing the dog
water and beefing up the heat in their doghouses (it's midnight and
about 3F). If I remember, I'll check tomorrow and p-mail.

I know I've seen Kats heaters recently at a FLAPS, but not the aircooled
VW version. I think they still make a dipstick version.

As an alternative, I've hooked a hotplate or heat lamp up to a switched
extension cord and parked the bus so the engine was over it. I would
switch on the heater before putting on coffee. By the time I was
showered, fed and dressed, the engine was toasty.

BTW: neither the sump heater or the hotplate will thaw out your frozen
doors! :) Try paste wax on the door frames and seals. AND... don't open
your front sliding windows during the day... I did that my first winter
in Logan, Ut with my '58 Bus... it was 2 days before the water in the
window track thawed again and enabled me to close it! BBBRRRR!

Good luck,
pd

&gt; ----------Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; On the subject of winter considerations it is going to be -25 tonight and
&gt; the thought occured to me where would one go to find a sump heater?  I've
&gt; heard of them but never seen one.  It is so cold I cannot get my doors
&gt; open,  frozen shut!  If it were not for the sheer beauty of the Rockies i'd
&gt; leave this frozen land.  So anyway anyone know where to get one and how
&gt; much?
