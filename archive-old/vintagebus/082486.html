Subject: RE: [VB] Rubber seals for a 67 waste

&gt;Subject: [VB] Rubber seals for a 67 waste
&gt;Date: Sat, 08 Jan 2005 16:32:04 -0800
&gt;
&gt;Hi All,
&gt;
&gt;I bought a 67 Westy pop top from New Mexico and am trying sort out all its
&gt;various problems.  Needless to say, every rubber seal should be changed and
&gt;my plan is to repaint so, having the seals nearby is helpful.
I have restored three 67 westies and have bought all the rubber from 
Wolfburgwest and have been quite happy with the quality.  I tried Bus Depot 
on the first bus and it was a disaster.  They sent me a small rear window 
seal when I clearly specified a 67.  They sent the wrong window rubber 
peices, too many of one not enough of another, etc.  They backordered some 
window peices that I recieved over SIX MONTHS late, well after the bus was 
finished.  They also managed to lose and not reimburse a money order for 69 
dollars.
Wolfsburg on the other hand has always sent exactly what I ordered and has 
on several occassions suggested corrections I needed to make in my order, 
such as correct seat color material and other items.  They really seem to 
know their busses.
