I would like to talk to any of you who have worked on Motori Minarelli
engines or Puch moped engines or just basic 2 cycle engines in general.
I've got some questions - some of which are moped model specific and others
are general 2 cycle operation questions.  Please p-mail me at
silent_at_beatricene_dot_com if you think you can help me out.  Thanks!

Erin
