Everything I've gotten from Rmm has worked out fine, I agree that VW should 
be helping out, its kinda like they are &quot;forgeting&quot; thier past.  I get the 
same treatment as you guys on not only my pre 1977 vws, but my 81 rabbit as 
well, and the parts guy at my local VW is a real cork screw of a jerk, he 
wouldnt fit in at any parts store (or anyplace that he had to come in 
contact with public society)

Anyways,
Matt in Pa.

Damn - looks like VWoA is going for the juglar veins now.  RMMW does rate
farily high in my book - second to Ronnie's www.oldvolks_dot_com shop.  I just
don't know why VW has got to be such a PITA about things.  They should work
with the aftermarket community and not against it.  By VW refusing to supply
parts and obsoleting them, they've created the market where unlicensed,
fake, aftermarket merchandise is almost a necessity.  T-Shirts and so forth
I can understand but what about those cheap repop parts that I can't get in
original form because VW NLA'd them?
