Our &quot;new&quot; '67 Micro Bus came with a newly rebuilt 1600 DP, which of course has
the infamous 009 and 34 PICT-3 combination.  It also has a breathed-on cam, an
extractor exhaust, and a degree wheel.  I haven't really noticed any flat-spot
problems, but the idle is rough, the engine failed emissions for high
hydrocarbons, and tends to stall until thoroughly warmed up, so I've started
playing around.

I've read that the trick to getting this dist/carb combination to work is to
plug the hole in the throttle butterfly, so I thought I'd give that a try.  The
recommendation is to use a pop rivet, but I couldn't figure out how to make that
work.  For one thing, the hole was too small for a 1/8&quot; pop rivet.  For another,
I'd have to pull the plate to rivet it, but then it would be impossible to
reinstall it in the original orientation, since it fits into a split shaft with
the hole on the far side of the insertion side.  It seemed important to put it
back in the original orientation since there are these semi-circular machinings
near one edge of the plate that look like they might be important.  Finally, I
ended up pulling the plate and cold hammering a short piece of a #4 finishing
nail to form a solid rivet.  Then I had to file down the &quot;heads&quot; of the rivet to
be slim enough to be tapped through the split throttle shaft.  Did I miss
something here?  Was there an easier way?

The other part of the standard 34-PICT carb mod to be compatible with the 009 is
to upsize the main jet.  However, here near Denver, at a mile high, I'm pretty
sure she is running quite rich already (as confirmed by the emissions test and
my senses).  Maybe too rich.

So I put the carb back on and got out the dwell/tach and the timing light.
Turns out the P.O. had set the overall advance to close to 40 degrees (according
to the wheel, anyway).  When I backed it down to 32 degrees, the idle speed
dropped way down.  Now I have trouble getting enough idle RPM.  The engine just
lopes along at idle, firing fairly randomly, missing a lot.  I think this may be
the fault of the (one notch up from stock) cam (but if it gives me any extra
pull in the thin air of the mountains, it's worth it).  Then again, maybe I have
to search for vacuum leaks and such, even though the engine still looks like
new.

I tried to do the standard tunings for the Bypass and Volume screws, but there
is no sensitivity there.  If I turn either one nearly all the way in, the engine
suddenly starts to choke, but other than that, I can move them many turns with
virtually no effect.  Of course, it's hard to adjust for max RPM when you're
watching an analog tach jump +-25 RPM due to random idle speed variation that's
there all the time.  I finally just set the things to the recommended starting
settings, and was barely getting a rough 850 RPM, max.  I found that I could
bump up the idle a bit by opening the throttle plate a hair with the stop screw
(basically negating what I did by plugging the hole!).  If I open it too far,
speed drops back down (losing suction on the idle circuit?).  So I've basically
tried to tune for as many idle RPM as I can, and it's barely enough.  (Note that
this engine does not miss under load or high RPMs.  Pulls pretty well. So I
don't think there are any obvious ignition, etc., problems)

The engine does seem quieter and smoother (or is it just making less power?) on
the road with the timing advance reduced to 32.  However, it's more likely to
bog at low RPM and doesn't idle as well.  Here in CO, I have never heard the
engine ping, even floored heading west (UP!) from Denver towards the continental
divide (at 35-45 MPH) on I-70, even when the overall timing was at 40.  I have
had a bus with a (too) high CR and I know what ping sounds like.  So I'm
considering going back to a higher timing setting, maybe 36 degrees.  Maybe the
specs are different here at altitude;  I know our gas tends to be a couple
points lower on octane (e.g. &quot;unleaded&quot; here is only 85 octane, at all the
stations), maybe our timing should be a couple more degrees advanced too?

Should I try leaner jetting?  Is more advance okay at altitude?  Should I give
up on the 34 PICT-3 and get some dual carbs (since I've got the cam and the
extractor anyway)?  Should I look for a vacuum advance dist?

Thanks for any advice!
