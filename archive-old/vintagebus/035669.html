 So i am cruising down the highway, get to the exit, pop the clutch in to
 downshift, and I hear this agonizing groan/grinding noise, and the oil
 pressure light pops on. I immediately turned the engine off, and hazards on
 coasted into a parking lot down the road. I was about a mile from the
 meeting.
 ...
 I guess what I mean by the flywheel having free play was that it feels like i
 can turn it about 1&quot; before the engine begins to turn, 
 
 ie the flywheel should turn precisely with the pulley on the back of the
 engine? well now when i turn the flywheel there is a certain lag before the
 rear pulley begins to spin. 
  
 ...I don't have the tools to remove the flywheel. So on monday I will be
 heading over to the &quot;best&quot; VW mechanic in houston, to see if he can pull the
 flywheel for me, and then see whats up....

the FW and the crank pulley are bolted to either end of the crankshaft.   If 
you turn one, the other should turn exactly the same.  If it does not, either 
your dowels are sheared or your crankshaft is broken.  I'm sorry.  Not fun.
