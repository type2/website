NQ:

If you are going to replace that swing lever pin and bushing, make sure to 
rent the tool from Bus Boys to do it right.

That bushing will need to be reamed after being installed and that is 
included with the tool. I have seen too many people try to hammer in the 
bushings and it ends up destroying everything.
