Sounds ilke you have a 12-volt, dual-speed motor ('67-only, I
believe).  Seems like it'd have been easier/cheaper to get a simple
on-off-on switch and go with all four wires (since your bus has been
converted to 12 volts), rather than the on-off-half/on switch that's
in there.

Try grabbing a '67 diagram to get the connections for the motor.
