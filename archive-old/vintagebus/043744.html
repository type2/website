Subject: Re: [VB] rings stuck to pistons?

&gt;My guess is that the rings are (still) stuck in the ring groves 
&gt;on pistons #`s 1,2,&amp; 3. I could drain and save my fresh oil, fill 
&gt;the cylinders with penetrating oil and wait, hoping the chemical 
&gt;action would dislodge them. But How long? 

I have a feeling that with the very low compression on those three
cylinders, you'd be able to tell it when turning the engine over
with a wrench - you may want to try this and see if you can tell
when your one reasonably good cylinder is on its compression stroke.
If you can, I'd suggest putting the oil in the cylinder(s) and turning
it over a few revs with the wrench or starter occasionally, then
carefully trying the wrench again to see if any of the cylinders seem
to have improved.

&gt;If it leaks past the rings and into the crank case, will the years of
&gt;gunk come off the inside of the case and foul up the oil passages?
&gt;Would Diesel or Gas be better? (and Cheaper?)

Unless you use gallons and gallons of stuff to loosen the rings, I
don't think you'll do anything that can't be fixed by a few &quot;short&quot;
oil changes over the first several hundred miles.  As to what to use
for a penetrating agent...you can probably get good arguments for
and against most anything: plain motor oil, diesel fuel, gasoline,
WD-40, PB Blaster, Kroil, Liquid Wrench, automatic transmission
fluid, Marvel Mystery Oil, Peruvian snail snot, etc.  If you're
really concerned about diluting the oil or washing stuff off of
the crankcase, try one of the more oil-like substances first
(plain oil, diesel, ATF, Marvel).
  
&gt;Maybe I could fill one cylinder, with about 100cc of penetrating fluid, 
&gt;install the spark plug, then bring that cylinder to top dead center 
&gt;ala valve adjustment procedure and tilt the engine on it's valve cover
&gt;to let the piston soak.

As long as you're careful not to bend the valve cover it could work.
I think you are proposing to turn the engine so the target cylinder is
close to the ground - you could do the same thing with less liquid by
pointing the target cylinder up in the air.  

Don't forget to drain whatever you use before you try to crank the
engine.  You don't want to try compressing relatively incompressible
oil.
 
&gt;How about heating up the cylinders with a propane or map gas torch?
&gt;This would make the pistons expand and maybe give me enough squeeze 
&gt;to start the beast and and knock the rings loose..

The intense localized heat would not be real great for the cylinders
IMHO.  If you really wanted to do something to the outside of the
cylinders you *might* try *carefully* tapping them with a *rubber*
mallet - do *not* use any kind of metal implement!  You don't want
to chip the fins.  Doing this raises the distinct possibility of
mucking up the cylinder-to-case sealing, too.

I hope this helps!
