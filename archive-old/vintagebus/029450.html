Subject: [VB] No rear turn signal lights in a 1967 bus

&lt;&lt;I plan to
build a circuit using off the shelf relays to drive the rear signals.&gt;&gt;

If you are gonna take the time to build a circuit, why not use solid
state switching devices instead of relays? From my AirForce electronics
days, its my experience that there is very little less reliable than a
relay (unless it has gold contacts). And I doubt the solid state devices
would be more expensive these days. After all, there isnt much that is
cheaper than sand.
