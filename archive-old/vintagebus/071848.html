So does that mean I should be scrapping the glue off the inside ceiling in
the back?  How fun :)

I also have one more very puzzling piece in the back.  Under the middle
window on the driver side there is a 1x1 piece of wood 2.5 ft. long screwed
in the wall horizontally.  This really reminds me of what was in my 71 Westy
to mount the Folding table too.  Does anyone know what this is for?

There is also 1x1 screwed to the top of the engine compartment in a H
formation (which could be a bed mount).  Anyone seen that.  I was pretty
sure that they didn't make camper is 56, is that true?

-Wayne
