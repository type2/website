Subject: Re: [VB] 67 bus wheel cylinders



&gt; Bentley calls for &quot;high melting point graphite grease&quot; on the adjuster
&gt; threads.  FWIW, I have some Haynes manuals for later-model US cars and
&gt; trucks.  They variously recommend &quot;white lithium-base grease&quot;, &quot;high-
&gt; temperature brake grease&quot;, &quot;high-temperature grease&quot;, and &quot;multi-purpose
&gt; grease&quot; for the adjuster threads.  They specify the same stuff for the
&gt; shoe-web contact areas on the backing plate, which I don't think Bus
&gt; brakes have - we don't have a spring that holds the shoe down to the
&gt; plate like most American cars do.

Back in the early 70's I worked at a Lincoln-Mercury dealership. Ford came out
and said do NOT use grease any more on the pads on the backing plate. Install
the shoes dry unless a groove has been worn into the plate. Only then use
white grease. Ford determined that the grease retained the brake dust and it
became a grinding compound paste. This wore grooves into the plate faster than
no grease.
