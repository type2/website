Just curious what was this guy doing?  Trying to
&quot;..liquidate buses and parts in an unscrupulous way..&quot;
 what exactly does that mean?  Is he selling stolen
parts?  IS he taking money and not sending out items? 


Also, how many emails about this fellow have you
recived?...sounds like just one.  Is this perhaps an
angry customer taking vengence?

Only reason I ask for detail is I 'may' have a deal in
the making with someone who sounds very much like this
person.  I  would like to know more info before I deal
with him any further one way or the other.

Please p-mail me if you wish to keep this off-list.

I appreciate the info!

&gt; We received email this past week alleging that an
&gt; individual was using
&gt; BuySell to liquidate busses and parts in an
&gt; unscrupulous way. Normally
&gt; we don't try to police transactions on BuySell, but
&gt; the amounts of money
&gt; mentioned in the email were pretty astronomical and
&gt; we felt we had to
&gt; look into it.
