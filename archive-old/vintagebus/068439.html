Subject: Re: [VB] 67 front brakes..

(4) 15mm Bolts hold on both of your wheel cylinders per side. You'll need a flat head screwdriver (to adjust the shoes) A cresent wrench (wheel nut removal), 14mm (?) wrench for the brake line/ upper wheel cylinder, and I think the inner line is a 10, 11 or 12 mm nut. 
If you are in there it's a good idea to replace the rubber brake lines too if you haven't for a while. 
Don't worry about your tie rods, it's not hard. Check your Drag Link too!
