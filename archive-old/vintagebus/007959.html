I was tied up in a 'death match' with my new insurance agent and
underwriters today concerning my '67 (the only way to get unrestricted
insurance with comp/collision on my bus was to in the end  change carriers
on the Ch*vy and F*rd as well, but I digress) and the value of a '67 bus
came up.   The CPI book value of a '67 type 22 bus was as follows:
Fair condition $2375
Good condition $4650
Excellent condition $6800

I am presuming that the 'CPI book' is comprable to the 'Kelly Blue Book'.
The definition of fair, good and excellent is open to interpertation and
ultimately up to an appraiser (which I still must see before I get the full
coverage going).


... not a great help but at least a pointer in the right direction

'67 to be considered (by me at least) in 'good condition'
