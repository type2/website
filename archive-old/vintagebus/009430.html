Hi list!

I have a problem with attaching the front license plate to my bus. I have 
bumpers with overriders (USA) and I have not been able to find the clamps 
to hang the license plate in (with rubber). Does any one know of a shop 
that could send me some of these?
Does any one know of a shop that sells the ECONO license plate frame?
