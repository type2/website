&lt;&lt; I was wondering how you tell if you have a dealer-installed Bus gas gauge
vs. something else?  I picked up a gas gauge at Jerome (which ruled, by
the way). It has the early RES -&gt; VOLL markings, screw terminal connections,
and is dated 1.58.  Someone mentioned to me that it also could be a gas
gauge out of a '58 Ghia.  Possible or ?

Thanks,

I have also heard that they could be out of ghias.  However, the ones I have looked at the part number on the back have said 271 xxx xxx, meaning bus (ambulance) guage.  maybe the ghias use dthe bus parts?  i dunno ghias.   I have seen a couple buses with dealer installed gas guages, but a heckuva lot more guages around than would seem to fit them. THose pre 61 guages are almost a dime a dozen.   Now how many early SENDERS have you seen? Think VW sold the guages so you could put one in yrself.  Hack the dash!  I find that those screws on the right side of the barndoor speedo pod are useful for attaching guage holders, and the barndoor steering wheel doesn't get in the way of seing them.
