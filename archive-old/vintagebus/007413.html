Dearest List:
Is it good to be back in the good ol US of A! We had a fabulous time in Baja
and the mainland, and except for a small problem in Guadalajara with the
shift coupler and frequent need of fuel filter changes, all went very
smoothly. We got some great pics of the bus in various tropical locations,
and will post a ton of them to the VWWO webpage and maybe even send Dave
Easterwood and neato a write up.  5500 miles in a splittie, and burning
mexican gasoline. More to come! Missed you guys.
