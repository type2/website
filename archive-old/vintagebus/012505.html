Re:walkthrough/bench was  Re: '65 Kombi found


Clara commented on the bench vs. walk-through preferences...
The bus formerly known as the Rat '63 has the walk-through feature. The
over-touted '67RFH Westy trophy slut has a bench seat config. Paula and I
laughingly call it the &quot;crawl-over&quot; design. The bench is especially fun for
gaining access to the rear area during twisting downhill Oregon runs. (Is
that your butt in the rear view or Grant's Pass?) Throw the spare on the
roof rack and keep your pile of Zap Comix, stale Doritos, Bugler substitute
and road worn dirty laundry in the spare tire well... The extra narrow bed
limits the left-right sleeping arraingement question to top-bottom. ;-)
I find more leg-room in the walk-through by hanging my throttle-leg out into
the aisle. Makes it harder for the stewardess to get by. Oops,
&quot;Flight-Attendant&quot; Sorry about that Mr. Bowman... Clara'a preference for the
bench is clearly rationalization for not having the aisle-config. Dr. Freud
called it walk-through envy.
I guess this could be a tad off-color &lt;like i care&gt; but was an insightful
device for practicing irritating hyphen-ated words. We vote for the
walk-through and less hyphens.
