Subject: Inner cargo door latch
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I'm supposed to be sending a cargo door latch to someone who posted about 
theirs having a striped screw in it or something similar a few days ago and 
can't remember who it was, I accidentally deleted all the info. If it was you 
p-mail me and I'll get it in the mail. My apologies to all who read this 
needlessly.
thanks
ronnieC.
