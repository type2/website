Subject: Re: [VB] Unearthed a treasure (long)...

That is a funny name for a dealership in my opinion
because auslander literally means &quot;foreigner&quot; in
German.

&gt; I was over at Matt 'n Katies house this Sunday,
&gt; working down through the 
&gt; patchwork quilt of bad paint and found something
&gt; that I thought was both 
&gt; exciting and intriguing. Under the top layer of
&gt; white paint, we found a 
&gt; dealer sticker above the left rear taillight.
&gt; Switching from sandpaper to a 
&gt; softer Scotch-Brite (TM) pad, Matt was able to
&gt; determine that it was from 
&gt; Auslander in New Hyde Park, NY. The M-code tells me
&gt; that the panel came in 
&gt; through New Orleans, but I think (due to some
&gt; unrelated info) that it was 
&gt; owned by this Auslander dealer for a number of years
&gt; before it came out 
&gt; west.
&gt; 
&gt; With this discovery, he disallowed me to continue
&gt; the sanding process so 
&gt; that we could research this bit of history. Here is
&gt; the photo:

&gt; 
&gt; We wrapped up for the day and I hit the sack, eager
&gt; to begin my research. I 
&gt; made three phone calls this morning and got some
&gt; great progress.
&gt; 
&gt; The first call was to VWoA and they had no record of
&gt; the dealer, nor were 
&gt; they very excited about helping out. Big surprise
&gt; there. I asked about a 
&gt; dealer-relations department and was told that none
&gt; existed. Hmm, I sensed 
&gt; futility and rang off from the super-friendly Amy.
&gt; 
&gt; The second call was to good ol' 411. I asked for
&gt; anything with VW in the 
&gt; name in New Hyde Park and unfortunately there was
&gt; only one listed. I didn't 
&gt; know what Volkswagen GC was, but I decided to give
&gt; it a try.
&gt; 
&gt; The last call was the gold mine. I called VW GC and
&gt; talked to Martha, the 
&gt; receptionist. She was helpful and friendly, but
&gt; seemed swamped. It was 
&gt; indeed a dealership and she had been there for 18
&gt; years. Apparently, &quot;GC&quot; 
&gt; was the new franchise purchased from Auslander! I
&gt; started babbling my story 
&gt; and she began to wane. &quot;Just a minute, sir&quot; and she
&gt; put me on hold.
&gt; 
&gt; I figured it was over, but a gravelly-sounding older
&gt; guy named John picked 
&gt; up the phone. Apparently he was the service manager
&gt; and had been there 28 
&gt; years. He was familiar with the previous ownership,
&gt; but was pretty confident 
&gt; that there wasn't any boxes of goodies stashed
&gt; anywhere full of Auslander 
&gt; gold. He went on to say that he had an &quot;old timer&quot;
&gt; working for him and that 
&gt; he had been there in the Auslander days and was a
&gt; real vintage nut. He told 
&gt; me to call back tomorrow (the guy works Tues-Sat)
&gt; and he would pull him off 
&gt; the bay to talk to me. He also said that the current
&gt; owner could be 
&gt; &quot;difficult to work with&quot; (my words, not his), but
&gt; that he would bring it up 
&gt; to him and see if any historical data, files, etc.
&gt; exist.
&gt; 
&gt; After thanking him profusely, I was getting ready to
&gt; sign off when he threw 
&gt; another shot across the bow. Apparently, there was
&gt; an area service rep (Hans 
&gt; somethingorother) that was really involved with the
&gt; dealership. He is 
&gt; retired now, but lives in San Diego. I'm going to
&gt; try and track him down 
&gt; too. Phew, not bad for the first day!
&gt; 
&gt; If anyone knows *ANYTHING* about this dealer, I am
&gt; eager to hear from you. 
&gt; Ultimately, I would like to find another sticker
&gt; like the one pictured, 
&gt; plate frames, dealer literature, vehicle history,
&gt; etc. to create a little 
&gt; info packet for the panel.
