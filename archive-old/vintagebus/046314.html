Subject: 7seater vs walkthough?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Split list, 

So I was looking at Thom's registry, trying to figure out how many 23 windows 
wakthroughs are in there, and came up with a non-archive answered question. 

A model 24x M-081 is a 9 seater deluxe walkthrough, simple enough.  (FWIW, 
there are fifteen 24x M-081 23-window in the registry.)

I had always thought that models 25x (7 seaters deluxes) were all 
walkthroughs.  This is what the SSVC/NEATO/BK spec book indicates on page 7 
as well as Meredith's Original VW Bus on page 123.  However, the registry has 
some model 25x with and without M-081. Perhaps some folks just missed the 
M-081 (but they filled in other M codes).  And why would they need any M code 
if walkthrough was standard for 25x?  What does a 25x NON-M-081 bus look like?

So, are all 25x's walkthroughs?  Maybe this fits the old rule, there were no 
&quot;standard&quot; busses, or just another mix up at the factory. 

Lets get this critical piece of bus history cleared up!
