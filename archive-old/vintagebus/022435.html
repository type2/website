Someone asked about brake fluid yesterday.  What follows is a pretty damn
good dissertation on the subject by Bruce Anderson, famed porsche mechanic
and author of the &quot;911 Performance Handbook&quot;

&gt;Awhile back I had a response to a column in 911 &amp; Porsche World on brake
fluid
&gt;as follows: 
&gt;Notice that in their article that they refer to conventional polyglycol brake
&gt;fluid as &quot;being remarkably incompressible&quot; therein lies the problem with
&gt;Silicone brake fluid it is compressible and gives you a spongy felling brake
&gt;pedal. Yes, polyglycol brake fluids absorb moisture and deteriorate, but
in my
&gt;opinion the pedal feel of silicone brake fluid is unacceptable when brand
new.
&gt;I have always suggested it as a superior product for cars that are static
&gt;displays such as museum pieces, but unacceptable for cars that are actually
&gt;driven. 
&gt;
&gt;Porsche recommends that the brake fluid be replaced every two years. Porsche
&gt;also goes on to recommend that we use only polyglycol, DOT 3 or DOT 4 fluids
&gt;and not DOT 5 silicone fluid. Furthermore they say that we should not add or
&gt;mix DOT 5 silicone type brake fluid with the brake fluid in your car as
severe
&gt;component corrosion may result. Such corrosion could lead to brake system
&gt;failure. 
&gt;
&gt;For the model year 1993 the brake systems in all Porsche models were filled
&gt;with an improved type of brake fluid, ATE type 200. ATE Type 200 fluid was a
&gt;new improved DOT 4 fluid with a higher dry boiling point, a higher wet
boiling
&gt;point which extended the life of the fluid and resulted in longer change
&gt;intervals (every 3 years). This same brake fluid is sold on the
aftermarket as
&gt;ATE Blue and is a superior DOT 4 brake fluid. 
&gt;
&gt;Brake fluid comes in DOT 3, DOT 4 or DOT 5 ratings. The DOT standards for
&gt;brake fluids were established in 1972. When the National Highway Traffic
&gt;Safety Administration, Department of Transportation (NHTSA) set up the
&gt;requirements for brake fluids they determined that there was a need for two
&gt;grades of fluid until an all-weather fluid was developed with viscosity and
&gt;boiling point characteristics suitable for all braking systems. In order to
&gt;provide added protection against vapor locking and fade in severe braking
&gt;service, DOT 4 fluid is recommended. But in such applications it is important
&gt;to note that the same higher viscosity that helps eliminated vapor locking
and
&gt;fade may result in poorer system performance in very cold weather Also, it
&gt;should be noted that the high boiling points are sacrificed in the DOT 3
fluid
&gt;for low viscosities for use at low temperatures. These differences between
the
&gt;viscosities of the DOT 3 and DOT 4 fluids are necessary to cover the
specified
&gt;operating temperature ranges and as such make it necessary to maintain both
&gt;DOT 3 and DOT 4 brake fluids. 
&gt;
&gt;DOT 5 fluid is supposed to be the all-weather fluid that is mentioned in the
&gt;preceding paragraph and it can be used as a replacement for both DOT 3 and
DOT
&gt;4 brake fluids. They test all three fluids for a great number of different
&gt;characteristics, however, the most interesting characteristics to us are the
&gt;equilibrium reflux boiling point (dry boiling point), the wet equilibrium
&gt;reflux boiling point (wet boiling point) and the kinematic viscosities
&gt;(viscosity at cold temperatures).
&gt;Dry boiling point: These are the minimum boiling temperatures allowed for the
&gt;various grades of fluid (this test simulates the boiling point when the fluid
&gt;is new).
&gt;DOT 3 401° F
&gt;DOT 4 446° F
&gt;DOT 5 500° F
&gt;Wet boiling point: These are the minimum boiling temperatures allowed for the
&gt;various grades of fluid when wet (this test is a  simulation of the boiling
&gt;point after the absorption of moisture from air) 
&gt;DOT 3 284° F
&gt;DOT 4 311° F
&gt;DOT 5 356° F
&gt;NOTE: These are the minimum requirements and there are brake fluids available
&gt;that will exceed these minimum requirements. 
&gt;Kinematic viscosities: All brake fluids (DOT 3, DOT 4 and DOT 5) must meet a
&gt;minimum viscosity test of not less than 1.5 centestokes at 100° C (212° F)
and
&gt;must not be more than the following to meet their various classifications
(the
&gt;larger numbers indicate higher kinematic viscosities just like with motor
&gt;oils). 
&gt;DOT 3 1500 Centestokes at minus 40° F
&gt;DOT 4 1800 Centestokes at minus 40° F
&gt;DOT 5 900 Centestokes at minus 40° F.
&gt;
&gt;There are some advantages to silicon brake fluid over conventional polyglycol
&gt;brake fluids. It is permanent, it does not absorb moisture, it does not boil,
&gt;it helps prevent corrosion rather than causing it, it will not damage paint
&gt;and it helps lubricate seals and other components in the brake system.
&gt;
&gt;The disadvantages, though minor, can be very annoying. Silicon brake fluids
&gt;are slightly compressible, or at least they appear to be because of their
&gt;affinity for air, which results in a different pedal feel from that of a
&gt;system which uses a conventional non-compressible polyglycol fluid. Because
&gt;of silicon brake fluid's affinity for air and their surface tension
&gt;characteristics they tend to cling to any air bubbles which get into the
&gt;systems braking making the system very difficult to bleed properly. 
&gt;
&gt;The brake fluids required for our Porsches are either DOT 3 or DOT 4 in new
&gt;and unused condition (that means that the can should be sealed so that there
&gt;is no moisture in the fluid). Porsche recommends that we changed the brake
&gt;fluid every two years because the conventional polyglycol fluids are
&gt;hygroscopic and will absorb moisture. When the fluid absorbs moisture, two
&gt;things happen: the boiling temperature goes down and the absorbed moisture is
&gt;corrosive to the brake components. Minimum wet boiling point is specified for
&gt;DOT 3 is 284° F and for DOT 4 is 311° F and because these fluids are
&gt;hygroscopic they commonly will approach these minimum limits. In contrast DOT
&gt;5 silicon fluids have a wet boiling temperature of 356° F and because they
are
&gt;not hygroscopic they will never approach the wet boiling limit. 
&gt;
&gt;The silicon brake fluids are DOT 5 and as such are required to be compatible
&gt;with all conventional DOT 3 and DOT 4 fluids in order to comply with the
&gt;federal regulations for DOT 5. 
&gt;
&gt;Silicon brake fluid is inert and is the only universally compatible brake
&gt;fluid. However silicon is not miscible and will not mix with other types of
&gt;brake fluids. Although the silicon fluids can be used with conventional
&gt;polyglycol fluids, they will not mix and the conventional fluid still in the
&gt;brake system can continue to absorb any moisture in the system components. 
&gt;
&gt;To gain maximum benefits for the silicon brake fluids the complete brake
&gt;system should be completely disassembled and cleaned before adding the
silicon
&gt;brake fluid. Then because of the silicon brake fluid's affinity for air,
it is
&gt;recommended that a pressure bleeder be used for bleeding the system. 
&gt;
&gt;I have had personal experience with silicon brake fluid in both street and
&gt;racing cars. And indeed have experienced difficulties getting the systems
&gt;properly bled. Even when we were sure we had properly bled the brake system,
&gt;the brake pedal always had a strange, soft feel to it. We attempted to use
&gt;silicon brake fluid in a Porsche 935 race car at Daytona one year for the
&gt;twenty four hour race because of the problems we have in Florida with the
high
&gt;humidity lowering the boiling point of the brake fluid. It probably would
have
&gt;achieved our objective; however, the drivers didn't like the pedal feel and
&gt;requested that we change it back to conventional fluid. In street cars the
&gt;silicon fluid has advantages which may outweigh its disadvantages,
&gt;particularly for older cars that do not get driven very much. Moisture
&gt;absorbed by conventional polyglycol brake fluid cause serious corrosion of
&gt;metal parts and deterioration of rubber seals and hoses in the brake system.
