 Hello All,
  Got a few questions for yall...
 First, Didnt a bus come with storage spot to keep the
 churchkey in? Seems I remember seein one on a rusted
 out westy.. lower left when seated in the drivers seat
 if memory serves correctly... mabey a S/C didnt have
 one?

on bus es w/pockets you put it in the pocket (before april 61).  april 61 and 
later they came with a church key holder that attaches with one of the screws 
holding the drivers side kick panel to the bus.   As many kickj panels have 
been tossed, many holders have been lost.  They are quite convienient though, 
if you can find one.   Doesn't hold the lollipop kind well, seems to be 
designed for the P shaped church key.

......
  Second, does anyone know what went in the steering
 colume bracket in the spot opposite of the ignition
 switch? Mine has a clear plastic plug in it. 
  &gt;&gt;

on a regular bus you have a switch for the rear dome light.  as you dont have 
a rear dome light they put a plug in the hole to make it tidy.
