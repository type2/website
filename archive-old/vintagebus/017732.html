Man, you must be desperate for insurance if you're with Progressive!
They're known as one of the companies you &quot;have&quot; to go to if nobody
else will write you.  BTDT!

Go thru the archives - this subject comes up every few months.  Basically
for &quot;collector&quot; insurance there are a set of guidelines as to condition
of the car, miles driven, storage, etc.  that must be met before they'll
write you.  Each company is different.  Some even require that you
own your house; they won't write renters!

A search on the 'net for 'classic car insurance' will turn up some 
helpful information.
