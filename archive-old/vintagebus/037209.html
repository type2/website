&lt;&lt; I just picked up another engine and the guy I got it from says it's a '53
 25hp.  Number is 1-0545 794      Can anyone tell me what year it is and if
 it's a 25 or 36hp engine? &gt;&gt;
Hi Eric,
Unless this engine was replaced with a later factory case that could have been
stamped with the original engine case number or bored to take the later 36 HP
cylinders, here is the info we have.  It should be a 25 HP engine made between
26 NOV 53  1-0563 195  and  21 DEC 53  1-0575 415.  This info is from VWs
Progressive Refinements...        Eric &amp; Barb
