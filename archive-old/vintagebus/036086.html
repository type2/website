What!?????
I guess im not sure if that makes sense.
Read and reread but I still do not understand.
I need these pieces to get my 57 bus back on the road.
I personally would never even think to charge more than 10-15 dollars for ANY 
piece of glass I have!
here I am, willing to pay what I and probably 99% of the listees would say is 
INSANE and still no luck!?????
