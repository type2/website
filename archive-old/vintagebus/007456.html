I took off Friday at about 7:30 pm for the 100 mile drive from Phoenix to
Jerome.  Surprisingly, I saw no other Jerome travelers along the way until I
got within 2 miles of the campground. Suddenly, a Bus and owner appeared at
the side of the road, flagging me down.  Lo and behold, it was Rusty Van
Bondo, having lost a shift coupler set screw, rendering him gearless in the
mountains of Arizona.  I gave him a ride into the campsite, parked myself,
and spent the evening listening to stories from the local cop about people
wrecking and rolling down the mountain in the Jerome snow and a summation of
the previous days setup from Rex and the Havasu Connection dudes.

Saturday, woke up, cruised around the campground checking out all the Buses
that had arrived so far and chatting with various owners.  Met a few
listees, picked up a few parts from the meager swaps, and watched the
caravan arrive and the people attempt to drive up the hill to the
campground.  Rained a bit in the afternoon, I took refuge in my Bus while
Clara schooled me on her '53 Standard until she needed more wine. :)
Saturday night produced 1 person ejected for attempted vintage cooler theft,
one guy up on the hills screaming and swearing at the campground until the
cops went after him, a lot of people saying 'Dude' and getting ridiculously
drunk to the entertainment of all, and a bongo drum circle of massive
proportions, perhaps to ward off the rain?  If so, it worked.

Sunday saw more swaps, more schmoozing with Bus owners and Barndoor people,
a story of hockey stick breakage on the way to Jerome, and I won &quot;Best
original early Type 2&quot; in the &quot;show&quot;.  Score!  The Bus Farmers bid on and
won the ultra-cool scrapbook of &quot;New Kids on the Block&quot; memorabilia in the
auction/raffle and the Raffle Bus win went to a first time Bus owner up in
Sacramento, CA.

I checked out my Bus for the ride back, tightening the carburetor as it had
come a little loose and removed the driver's side rear shock as it had
snapped off the suspension.  Guess you can't JB-Weld your suspension, duh!
The drive back home I classify as &quot;Perfect Volkswagen Weather&quot; and my Bus
seemed to have more power after tightening the carburetor.  Saw a lot of
Buses on the road and at gas stations, many of which I could not remember
from the show.  Guess that's a testament to the size of it...  My guess
would be around 300 Buses total, I missed the official count.  It was nice
to see so many daily-driver style Buses in one place!

Oh yeah, I slept on my back seat the 2 nights, big mistake, next year I
don't leave my tent on the garage floor!  Guess I earned bragging rights,
though...

Later,
