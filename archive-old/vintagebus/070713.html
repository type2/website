Subject: Subject: Popular Mechanics VW feature?

&gt;&gt;Does anyone know what year and month featured a VW Westy in it?  Seems it
was
a late 50's one.

I have a July 1955 issue here on my desk. It has a bus camper on the cover,
but the article does not mention the conversion company. It might be a
westie.  It is a cool two page article.
