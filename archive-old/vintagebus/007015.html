I now have Masonite interior door panels and kick panels for early buses, we
are currently working on roof panels and cargo area panels. These are made
in Brazil and are a very nice alternative to the cardboard ones currently
available. Those that have seen them and have bought them have had no
complaints so far. The prices are 45 dollars for the door panels (in stock)
and 30 dollars for the kick panels (sold out at the moment) we will have
more hopefully before Christmas along with the roof panels, cargo door and
interior panels. We are also working on replacement pockets for door panels
also, not plastic.

ps; look for a feature on these in the March? issue of Hot VW's in the new
products section.

Does anyone have the phone # or email address of the guy in the Sacramento
area that does bus interior bits?  I lost his card.

Thanks.
