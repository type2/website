 In Texas there's an ole boy named Larry Machacek. P.O. Box 515, Porter, 
Texas 77365, Phone No. 281-429-2505. Larry has a supply of brand new plates 
for every
year. Once in a while he has to have a set restored, but mostly he just 
delivers sets
that they made too many of. There is no question about the plates being 
duplicated. Most were never registered.

What I like about the old plates is that Texas law eliminates the need for 
re-registering a car for 5 years (the car must be 25 years old or older, 
however). Also, one can remove all stickers from the car except for the plate 
designation. If you have a car that needs the space, such as one with a 
chopped top where too many stickers can get in your way, this is the perfect 
solution. Ron Hansen has such a chopped top on his 1963 Bug. All you have to 
do is present a set of plates (Machacek's plates always pass the test) for 
the state to look over and approve. Then 
you are in. Plates earlier that 1963 are the more attractive ones.
