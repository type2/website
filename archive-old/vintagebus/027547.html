 What do you guys use on the bow ends and clamps to protect your roof...
 My fresh SWR paint needs protection!
 I think a plasti-drip product of some sort used to be the talk of the 
list... 
 Procedure? is this the best
  &gt;&gt;

The rack on my shiny 65 westy has little rubber booties on the end of the 
legs which sit in the drip rail.  you could make these out of fuel line or 
some such.

it has clamps which slide under the drip rail have bits of yellow cloth tape 
on them to protect the paint.  You could put cloth tape (choose the colour) 
on yours.

my OG paint 61 has a roof rack with none of these protect the paint frills, 
but the paint is in bad shape anyway.
