Subject: door hinge lubrication

So I just took a look at my door hinges, because one's getting a
little stiff, and couldn't figure out how to properly lubricate it.
By properly, I mean getting the oil between the horizontal friction
surfaces.  Getting it along the shaft of the pin seems relatively
easy.

Any suggestions?  WD-40 is not the answer.
