Subject: roof options
Message-ID: &lt;3784B370.1B5F_at_camtech_dot_net.au&gt;

dear listees, whose opinions I value greatly,
If all goes according to plan, I will be adding my 3rd bus to the stable
this week.
I've found a '61 that has been used as a camper used as a daily driver
until 3 months ago.  The PO has removed &amp; no longer has the camper
interior, infact the bus now has no interior.  This suits fine, as I
intent to use the bus interior from my crashed :( '67.
Being a camper, it has a pop top &amp; because I am intending it to be a bus
I am not going to use the pop.
This is where my options lie and request listees input although the
final decision is mine as it is my bus blah blah.
1. Take the roof off of my '63 standard, which is really only suitable
as a parts donor, and have a hard roof.
2. Do what the PO of the '67 did, and have a removable vinyl section
over the pop top hole for great summertime open air motoring, or
3. Use the roof off the '63 and then install a NOS factory sliding roof
4. Install a modern sliding sunroof complete with electric winder.
Questions are these:
Is it possible to do a roof transplant?
Is there a size difference between a pop top &amp; the factory sunroof?
Does anyone import/stock factory NOS sunroofs to Australia

Input eagerly awaited,  Daniel
