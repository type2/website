&gt; baywindow tank from a 70 bus.  I have some questions that need to be
&gt; answered to help me decide whether or not to go this route.
&gt;
&gt; Will the 12v sender from this tank work with my 6v bus
&gt; guage?  Will a 6v sending unit from a split window bus tank fit in a
&gt; baywindow tank with no mods? Will the stock gas cap from a splitty tank
&gt; go onto a baywindow tank?


I'm late into this thread, so maybe I missed something.  But a brand new
splitty gas tank is less than $150 as I recall (not checking my website
right now but I know I'm pretty close).  What's the benefit of trying to
modify a bay-window tank to fit instead?
