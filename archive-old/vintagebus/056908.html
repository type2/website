Maybe they need a NEW PLACE so we all can get in.

&gt; 
&gt; Hey all of you planning to be in California in
&gt; April!!!
&gt; 
&gt; 	Just wanted to throw out a reminder about the BYOB
&gt; (Bring your own
&gt; Bus) Bus
&gt; Show at The Red Barn, Saturday, April 6th!
&gt; 
&gt; 	See details at
&gt; http://www.redshift_dot_com/~taylorvw/svt/
&gt; 
&gt; 	SEE YOU THERE!
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 	Also, I got some recent details about Kelley Park
&gt; the following
&gt; Sunday,
&gt; April 7th.  Based of the current situation, it looks
&gt; like it's going to be
&gt; very packed again this year.   A new rule for the
&gt; park, this year, NO CARS
&gt; ON THE GRASS!  This was mandated by Kelley Park, not
&gt; by the Golden Gate
&gt; chapter.  ULP!  That means it will be similar to
&gt; what was seen last year on
&gt; the 'rain/wet grass' plan.  Also, The lower parking
&gt; lot will NOT be used for
&gt; the swap.  This was mandated by the City of San
&gt; Jose, not by the Golden Gate
&gt; chapter.  Another, smaller area in the park is
&gt; planned to be used along with
&gt; some of the (former) car show space.  They are
&gt; working on both of these
&gt; issues and plans may change in a moments
&gt; notice...hopefully for the better.
&gt; My suggestion is to get there early!
&gt; 
&gt; 	More info about Kelley Park can be found at

&gt; 
&gt; Cheers!
