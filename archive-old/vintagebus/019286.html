I continued working on the Westy's less and less thrashed wiring today.  I
thought I would be finished up front today, but unfortunately there are still
issues with turn signals and hazards.  I did more testing on the 9 prong box,
and determined that it was bad.  The brake light wire did not get hot when the
hazards were on (54).  So I pulled the Wolfsburg West replacement box out of 
the Kombi and plugged it into the Westy.  Hazards worked on all four lights!
The turn signals, however, now only work up front.  ARGH!  I'm going to do 
more testing Thursday but I now suspect the switch.  Looks like I had two bad
things going on...I went ahead and pulled the indicator switch out of the Kombi
since I knew it was good, and the one in the Westy doesn't like to stay where I
put it anyway.

Frustrated with the front for the time being, I moved to the engine compartment
for the first time.  I've pinned down what wires do what now, and did some 
rejoining of cut wires, cut out and rejoined (and covered) bare sections, etc.
The solder + heat-shrink tubing makes for a really clean looking repair.  

One thing made me wonder back there.  In the Kombi, on the B+ terminal of the
voltage regulator there's a fat red wire that runs back through the same hole
that the positive battery lead and coil/oil wires run through.  On the Westy,
there is a skinnier black wire, with an inline fuse, that runs in front of
where the gas tank was and back up by the driver's side engine louvers.  This
wire is inside stock-looking tubing like all the rest of the compartment wiring
(the black plastic tubing) and doesn't look like a hack.  What gives?  Since I
wasn't sure about it, I spliced 10 gauge wire in with the positive battery
lead, and will also run that to B+ on the regulator.  This is how it is in the
wiring diagram, but not on either of my buses.  Seems ok to me...someone please
let me know if I'm being dumb here :-)

More electrical fun on Thursday, hopefully I'll get it finished so I can start
working on the brakes!
