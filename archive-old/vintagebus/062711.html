Subject: Sender not sending?

I converted to the larger late model tank and my sender was working 
correctly till a couple of days ago.  I was hoping it would start working 
again after I filled up and it did register a full tank, but it never shows 
below 3/4 and I was almost empty.  It's the '66 stock gauge with later tank 
and sender on 12 volts.

Thanks,

Bart Daugherty
