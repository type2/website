Subject: My H-case saga... specs and ideas.
References: &lt;199808061453.HAA00238_at_yiff.azaccess_dot_com&gt; &lt;199808061645.JAA13792_at_yiff.azaccess_dot_com&gt;

I was able to retrieve a lot of stuff i needed from a '64 splitty
basketcase, including the engine, which the PO said was in great shape.
	When i got around to fully disassembling it, I noticed the following:
	(the usual earlier stuff): SP heads, small oil pump studs, single
relief case, 6V flywheel.
	8mm head studs... maybe a more stretchable upgrade from the 10mm? I'll
have to look for case savers.
	The case ID number on the oil filler base had been machined off, maybe
with an end mill, and a cool VW logo with two arrows around it each
coming back around to the end of the other arrow, stamped in it's place.
The logo I take to mean that the engine was factory remanufactured by
VW... and an &quot;H&quot; was stamped after the logo. You can still see vague
remnants of the old case # above the machined-off area.
	The case was amazingly NOT line-bored, as many I have torn down have
been. I was very happy about this. I assume that VW did the stress
relieving operations to it when they rebuilt it... good.
	The crank was ground .020&quot; on the rods, .010&quot; on the mains, with the
thrust standard...
	The heads were also interesting... I tore them down to find that the
valve guides were more worn on the exhausts than the intakes. It was
also interesting to note that the valve guide seals were still
new-looking and flexible (!) on the intake valves, but the exhaust valve
seals had already disintegrated, likely the result of exhaust leakage
through their valve guide/stem clearances. 
	The 83.45 mm (!) (1500cc) pistons have the 2 X 2 X 4 mm rings, and
appear to be in wonderful condition... I plan on getting a new set of
rings to put on them after I clean them up and am ready to balance. It
was also neat that every cylinder had a roughly .020&quot;-.040&quot; shim under
each barrel.
	If it has no case savers, I'll plan on installing them along with the
8mm studs... they will be strong enough for a bone stock motor, I
believe, without risking stud-pulling overmuch.
	It is legendary how long the earlier motors ran and how efficiently
they ran with small oil galleys, single relief, and small oil pump
studs. The H-cases seem to me to be some kind of pupal/larval stage
between early cases and the A's... and perhaps were a metallurgical
testing ground in themselves, but I feel that properly assembled and
treated, they will last a long time. (that is, balanced, with CR and
deck height and all the critical clearances approved... and maybe even a
full-flow and a sand seal...)
	Once I get it built I'll post problems/satisfactions with it...

&gt; H CASES SUCK!
&gt; 
&gt; A case carrying an 'A' prefix would be far superior.
&gt; There are many problems with the 'H' cases. The first
&gt; one is an alloy problem that VW ran into. The 'H' material
&gt; was too soft, so it pulls studs WAY too easy. Not only was
&gt; the material soft, but there weren't any case savers either.
&gt; They had small oil galleys, a single pressure relief, and
&gt; small pump studs just to name a few more problems. I'm sure
&gt; that there is more too, but those are all I can think of right
&gt; now..... Anyone have some more input?
