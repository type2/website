Subject: Re: [VB] VW do Bazil parts CD for trade

Too bad you can't make CD-R copies for anyone on this list who wants one
(like ME!).  If you don't like the idea of selling copies, you could
request that the person wanting the copy be the one to supply the blank
CD-R disk.

&gt;I am currently fiddeling with a VW do Brazil parts CD, and it is
&gt;interesting.
&gt;
&gt;The current South American Bus indeed has the ancient king pin front
&gt;axle. With disc brakes no less.
&gt;
&gt;Since the current mexican Bus Micro Fiche shows the ball joint axle and
&gt;that Bus is also made in Brazil, one might conclude that they produce 2
&gt;slightly different Busses simultaneously.
&gt;
&gt;I also did not know that they sell the Eurovan down there, with the VR6
&gt;and a diesel engine.
&gt;No Vanagon though, they are clever.
&gt;
&gt;Of course some of the aircooled stuff is truely weird. That dual double
&gt;carb stuff and that tuck-away muffler in the left rear fender of the
&gt;Beetle sure is different for a stock guy like me.
&gt;
&gt;The CD contains the following VW's:
&gt;
&gt;Apollo
&gt;New Parati
&gt;Beetle (the old Beetle)
&gt;New Gol/New Saveiro
&gt;New Kombi
&gt;Polo Classic
&gt;Golf
&gt;Caravelle/Eurovan
&gt;Kombi
&gt;New Passat/Variant
&gt;Santana/Quantum
&gt;Passat/Variant
&gt;Logus/Pointer
&gt;Voyage/Parati
&gt;Gol/Saveiro
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;A would like to trade the CD for a VWoA or european one. I am sure there
&gt;are runnable copies out there.
&gt;My emphasis is on TRADE.
&gt;
&gt;If interested mail me directly.
