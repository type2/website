Subject: Re: [VB] Gas Tank Problem

Hi Mike,
You need to figure out which tank you have now.  Check Vintagebus_dot_com website 
for Thom's article with good photos, for installing a post-1967 bus fifteen 
gas tank.  The 1968-71 tank fits easily in the pre-1968 bus and has the 
threaded outlet which the pre-1962 reserve switch can be attached.  The 1972 and 
later tank does not have the same bottom as the 1968-71 and the pre-1968 bus gas 
tanks so needs shiming under it to fit.  Plus somewhere in the later 1970s the 
tank outlet went from the same used from 1950 to a fuel line slip on fitting, 
so no reserve switch can be mounted there.  
  As for your leak problem a pre-1968 bus tank will do the same if not worse. 
 One just has to fill the tank when one plans to drive at least 30 or more 
miles beofre parking.  Also if your parking spot is off the steet, learn to back 
in so the tank fill is uphill.
  We have installed 1968-71 bus tanks in our 1963 SC and 1960 walk thru panel 
camper conversion, and both have reserve switches!  Especially nifty when 
taking out the engine or replacing all the flex fuel when we can shut off the 
flow of fuel at the tank.
  We did cut off the pre-1968 bus gas tank neck to be fitted with the 1968-71 
gas tank which its original neck is connected via large diameter flex fuel 
hose.  Did have to cut reangle and weld the earlier neck to a tighter angle so 
the neck passed straight through the body grommet.
  We have been thinking of installing a charcoal canister and hooking it up 
to the top vent in these tanks to prevent so much fuel outgassing from the 
tank.  Something that is better for not only the enviroment, but will help add 
just a tiny amount of better MPG.
