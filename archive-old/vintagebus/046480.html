Hi Kerry,
Nice full length roof rack!  It is of German manufacture of which there where 
at least two differant styles of this particular manufacture.  The tapered 
sided type you have and a straight down sided one.  Which type was made first 
or at the same time we do not know.  The racks that are going to howl are 
probably USA made with thinner walled thicker dia. tubing.  Have had this 
happen with made for VOA and other USA bug racks and had to weave a bungee in 
amongst the tubes from front to rear to dampen the loud howl.   Eric&amp;Barb
