Subject: What's in your splits ash tray?
Date: Fri, 13 Nov 1998 14:21:41 -0800

All this poking about under the dash and under the seat made me think, &quot;What
the heck is in my dash ash tray?&quot;

I've got this stuff in my 65's ash tray

one rust covered nickle
four pennies
a fuzzy green Cheerio (maybe two, it's gross so i'm not going to check)
three fuses, (1 red, 2 white)
an old gas recipt from 1996
a yellow posty note with the ink bleading (looks like a grocery list)
dirt and bits of crud
and finally a big fat Dubie from 1967!! (NOT ! just kiddin' :-)
