Subject: Re: [VB] lines &quot;swelling?&quot; brake fluid types

They just lose there elasticity and after years of swelling and heat and
cold they lose their stuff.  I don't think I would want to mix brake fluid
type though.  No reason that I know of just can't be good otherwise there
would be only one type of brake fluid.   I am  a mailman so look to some one
else to explain why!!

&gt; So, what makes the swell shut? I topped off the fluid,
&gt; could that be it? Does DOT3 and DOT 4 mixing do
&gt; something? Becuase I put in DOT 4 and I'm not sure
&gt; what was in there before.
