Subject: Re: 6V to 12V

&gt;I have all new bulbs, turn signal relay, voltage drops for wipers, gas
&gt;gauge and clock.

You probably have a 12 V flasher for the turn signals - did you get a
12 V relay for the hazard lights as well?  (On your wiring diagram,
the flasher is item J, the relay is item J1).  If you don't have a
12 V hazard flasher relay, you can make one out of two common 12 V
automotive relays.

&gt;I also have a hard start relay installed already.  Will I need to do
&gt;anything with this?? It worked with the 6V fine.

If you leave it in, it will work for a while and then die.  You can
either take it out of the circuit entirely, or replace it with a 12 V
relay.  If I was doing it, I'd take it out of the circuit and see how
reliable the starting is with 12 V first.

&gt;If anyone knows of anything I left out please pass it on...

Once you have the voltage drop for the wipers hooked up, measure the
voltage at the wiper motor with the wipers on.  Take a worst-case
measurement with the engine at idle, headlights on, brakes on, and one
turn signal on, and a best-case measurement with the engine at around
2500 RPM and everything else electrical turned off.  You want the voltage
at the wiper motor to be around 6 V to 7 V at all times.  7.5 V is
probably a good upper limit.  If it's lower or higher than that and you
have an adjustable voltage drop, adjust it.  If it's lower than that and
your voltage drop isn't adjustable, you may need a different voltage drop.
If it's higher than that and your voltage drop isn't adjustable, you may
need a different voltage drop OR another of the same voltage drop in
series.

Don't forget at least one 111 999 998 - magic smoke, 1 L tin.  I hear
it's been NLA for a long time, though.  :)
