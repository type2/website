A bug sender(113 919 049a) will bolt into you tank and will work as long as
you still have the voltage stabilizer (113 957 099a) on the gauge(this keeps
the needle from bouncing around due to float movement), some of the new bus
senders are float style (same as bug) but I haven't had a chance to check
the ohms on them yet, the old style bus senders (271 919 051b) were a tube
with the float inside.

I have both senders in stock, bug ones I have are manufactured in Mexico and
Germany,the bus ones are still the original style manufactured by Siemans,
Mexico.

ps. my new (coming real soon) online catalog, will list this information
for your convenience.

ps. the bay tank uses even a different sender
68-1/73  211 919 051		
2/73-    211 919 051a
this shows that there are 2 different bay tanks, i will check out the
difference between the 68-1/73 and the later tank, i have a couple of each
here

while every one is focused on gas tanks, Does any one know if I can use the 
late bug gas gauge thats built into the speedo in my 59' bus in combination 
with a gas tank from a 67' bus? If the sender isn't compatible is there one 
that will fit the tank that is? I want to have a gas gauge thats in plain 
view, without cutting a hole in my dash.
