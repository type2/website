Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [T2] gas tank resto  varnish/sludge

So would the tank from the 57 bus have solder sealing the seams? I think I'm
gonna have to go with a hot tank at the local metal specialties and
re-paint. The local radiator shops won't touch it and when I called the
folks at por-15 a bit ago they didn't sound very confident in their own
products ability to remove the varnish build up.
&gt;
&gt; ps. You have to be real careful on older gas tanks. I learned my lesson on
&gt; an old 356 Porsche tank. Had it hot tanked at a radiator shop, came out
&gt; beautiful. Painted it, finished restoring the car 1955 356. Went to put
gas
&gt; in it and it leaked live a sieve. The chemicals in the hot tank ate the
&gt; solder away and it leaked at the seams!!!!
