Subject: RE: [VB] Re: bias plys?

&gt;I'm still running the 25-yr-old Firestone 700x14 8-ply mud and snow tires
on my 67 DC that the PO left on it--there are years worth of tread left
since I only drive it on weekends.
&gt;
When I replaced the 20 yr. old bias plys on my '55 Kombi, the guy at the
tire store said they would have exploded off the rims if not for the fact
that tubes inside were much newer.

Having had the rear tires explode off the rims on a Notchback at 65 mph
(Michelin radials), I think my top speed of 55 mph in the Kombi gave me
some extra miles.  The Notchback Michelins looked brand new and only had
about 10,000 miles on them but were 10-15 years old.

With new bias plys, my Bus drove MUCH better too.
