Well,
I have recieved more than a few responses regarding my door panels. Everyone
has said that the panels neve covered the whole door. I have posted an image
to my website showing a section of the door. You may notice that the panel has
a metal frame around it, that looks a bit more than custom. the window on the
door is a crank out type. (*The image is a bit stretched, and my web page
sucks, but I only use it to show individual images)

Anyway, does this interior look familiar to anyone? I was assured when I
bought it that it was original.

I guess I was tricked, but I still love the bus.
