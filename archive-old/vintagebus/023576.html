&lt;&lt; I checked out that CE safari page and am wondering about the large and 
small
 rear safaris. This means that I also do not know, are the rear windows on
 singlecabs and buses? It seems they would, but I hadnt gotten around to
 asking you all.  Also, are there any pics of how far the rear safaris
 actuate? Or if you can describe how far they open out.
  &gt;&gt;
what I think you are asking is are these rear safris for the rear windows, if 
so it is yes.   The idea being you also have front safrais, and this creates 
the flow through window tunnel I need aviator goggles now effect.

If you use rear safaris w/o front ones open, you will notice a distinct odor 
of exhaust coming into the vehicles.   Perhaps not on a single cab, but the 
first time I drove my 65 it had the back window smashed out., and I opened 
the front safaris up all the way and drove to the car wash to wash the motor 
and mass exhaust came in , and the windtunnel effect was quite noticable, the 
wood on the roff started falling and shredding and blowing out the back 
window.   It was a little hectic.  I think if the back window was open only a 
little that would not have happened quite so much, perhaps.
