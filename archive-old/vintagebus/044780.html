Hi David,
&lt;&lt; The van also has a cab divider that looks to be in very good shape. It does
have a pading over it, so I am wondering if that is the way its supposed to be
or did someone do this.&gt;&gt;
Since there was never a padded version that we know of we would have to say
the padding is not factory.

&lt;&lt; The glass window is there too. &gt;&gt;
Does the window have the Serkerit brand name on it?
