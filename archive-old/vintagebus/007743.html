Hey everybody,
I'm back on the list again, glad to be getting so much bus-ness in my =
email again.

so... my '66 Westy is definitely screwed up.  I took it through AirCare =
(emissions testing) a few weeks ago, and was suprised to find out that =
it failed dismally.  Took it to my mechanic, who said the motor has =
something wrong internally, suggesting either lifters or the cam.  =
Apparently cylinders 1 and 2 aren't functioning properly.  Hmm... guess =
this could be the source of the overheating, although I have to admit I =
really don't completely understand how the cylinders could have good =
compression but not be doing anything.  FWIW, I put on new pistons and =
cylinders and new heads in the spring, but I didn't do anything to the =
bottom end at all, mostly due to fear of the unknown.  I figured that =
was as far as I wanted to go for the time being, but I knew it would =
come back to haunt me and it has. =20

As for the transmission, it's been leaking pretty badly for quite some =
time, the oil seems to be coming from all over the pass. side of the =
transmission, altho I can't say for sure.  I'm wondering about the =
little boot that covers the shiftrod at the front of the tranny, should =
I be able to see shiny metal sticking out at the front of that or is it =
supposed to seal the shiftrod?? =20
In addition to the leak, shifting has gotten really weird.  The gears =
are normally kind of sloppy, but only to a degree I would consider =
normal.  A few weeks ago, suddenly the shifting was really tight, like =
the usual play in the shifter was gone.  Now it's gone back to the other =
end of the scale, so that the shifter is really loose again, but it's =
become very difficult to find 3rd and 4th gears, to the point that I =
would end up downshifting back to 2nd because I  couldn't find 3rd in =
time.  The linkage appears fine, nothing amiss in the front shifter area =
or the rear coupling.  Is this a sign of a dying tranny?
Can anyone tell me what the symptoms of a worn throw-out bearing are?  A =
friend suggested that might be why my engine seems to emit a loud(er) =
thudding sound when the clutch pedal is depressed.
So, I'm thinking I need to pull the motor apart again and possibly pull =
out the transmission too.  I've constructed a rain shelter for the bus =
with this in mind, as we're heading into that lovely vancouver fall =
season of wetness.  Any advice on what to do with the tranny?  rebuild?  =
try to buy a used one?  give up and use the bus as a storage shed?  Just =
kidding.  I didn't bring the bus all the way from Tennessee to use it as =
a planter.
All advice appreciated
TIA,
Diana
