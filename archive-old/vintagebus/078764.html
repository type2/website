Subject: Vent window rivet and OG replacments????????

the vent window latch on the passenger side of my '66 Sc has broke and I
have a repo replacement (Chrome though)

it before I take it apart!?  Also before I do the Chrome replacement are
there any or the OG black one out there in any ones stash so I could do them
