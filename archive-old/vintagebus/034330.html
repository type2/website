Subject: Looking for Tent and Poles for Split 64 Bus

Hello everybody. I just joined the list and I currently have a 1964 Split
Window Bus that is Red and White.

My bus was original a camper but everything has been removed inside. The
only thing left is the flip lid and the mounting brackets on the outside to
add a tent. I have found tons of pictures of tents on buses and have looked
around the internet but can not find a place to buy one.

If you have the complete Tent and Poles (my bus already has the mounting
brackets on top of the bus) or just the poles, and want to sell them, please
let me know. Right now I am looking just for something like the link below

but I am also interested in buying the whole tent set

Please send me an e-mail at richard_at_holdman if you have one to sell or can
direct to place that sells them online.

Thanks
