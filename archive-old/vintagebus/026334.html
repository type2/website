Sounds like a simple hydrogen/oxygen generator.  Take water, run
electricity through it, makes hydrogen and oxygen.  you pipe it to your
intake tract.  when it meets in the combustion chamber and gets ignited
it turns back into water when burned.  just what you need in the engine.

sounds good on paper but you just don't get more energy out then you put
in.  takes electricity to do this.  electricity from your generator
turned by (that's right) the engine.  the quantity of gasses put out by
the system is minuscule and really won't make that much difference in
power output.

you're better off going nitrous of forced induction
