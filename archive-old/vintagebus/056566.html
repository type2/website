Goto
www.mcmaster_dot_com
Then do a search for &quot;Adhesive-Back Damping Sheet&quot;

The mastic ones are what I believe to be the ones that people call 'tar'
mats.

&gt; &gt;Anyone have suggestions on &quot;insulation&quot; for sound deadening?  Is it worth
&gt; doing?  This was on a singlecab at Jerome last year.they claim that the
&gt; singlecab is so quiet that they cannot hear the engine running.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Not for nothing but every *stock* Single and Double Cab I have ridden in,
&gt; you could not hear the engine at idle and barely hear it at highway
speeds.
&gt;  Wind noise drowned it out.
&gt;
&gt; You can barely hear the engine running at idle in my my '55 Kombi (stock
&gt; 36hp) but at highway speeds, it's ear plug time.
&gt;
&gt; I installed some McMaster-Carr sheets behind my rear seat, it did not
appear
&gt; to do much, if anything.  I was considering slapping on another layer.
&gt; Or maybe I just need one of them fancy Buses with a headliner and cargo
&gt; area panels.  ;)
