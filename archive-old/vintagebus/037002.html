Man, that was a brutal message to Michelle.
One must remember the first time we took a wrench
 to our first VW.
We probably did everything wrong, but somehow
 the damn thing ran anyway.
That is the magic of VW's.
It is only after we think we know everything that
 we start running into 'magical' problems.
And, while it is true that newer cars can go faster,
 handle better, get more miles per gallon, and 
 get by with a lot less maintenance, VW's are
 still practical for people (men AND women) 
 who like to tinker with stuff.
I bought my '65 bus for 600 bucks, a used transaxle 
 for 200, and a rebuilt motor for 450. After about a 
 month of weekends, my 1250$ got me a reliable
 utility vehicle that makes for great weekend driving,
 can haul around almost anything a truck can, and 
 gets 21 MPG.
Also, I want to point out that I am not a Hoover-Basher.
That's gone on long enough. Your advice is priceless.
Sometimes we just need to look back at what got us
  into these VW thingies anyway.
PS
    Rock on Michele!
