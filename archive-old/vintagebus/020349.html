I fixed this the other day, but the problem persists.   So unless it came
loose again, it's must be something else.   But I'll check it again before
I proceed with more time comsuming measures...

&gt; &gt;Check the electric fuel cutoff switch on the left side of the carb.
&gt; &gt;Sometimes they get a little loose in the carb body due to engine
&gt; &gt;vibrations. They cause intermittent idle problems when they're loose. A
&gt; &gt;drop of the lightest grade locktite will keep them from getting loose.

&gt; Or the wire does! Is it crimped on tight at both ends?
