Subject: Aussie single cab

VW Buddies and gals,

I was surfing for Aussie busses and found this little potential beauty:  '54
singlecab, with safaris, rusty floor, dents, for $A11,000.  Don't be put off
by the price, as the Oz dollar is only .60 cents.  Best part about this is
that it has the original engine!

Here is a pic:

Sweet if someone wants to spend two grand getting it over here, and don't
forget it'll be RHD.

Best,

Curt
