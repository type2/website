Subject: Re: [VB] Head repair question...

why not get some new heads?  Last time I checked dp were 105 ea and sp were 
125 ea.   may well be cheaper to get new than rebuild.

 I have a head that was ran loose and subsequently, it burned a hole in the

ones.  Looking at the inside of the head on the &quot;bottom&quot;, there is a 2&quot; or so 
neat &quot;burned&quot; groove into the head that follows just inside of the 
circumferance of the cylinder mating surface about a 1/16&quot; deep.  However,

There are no cracks that I see.
