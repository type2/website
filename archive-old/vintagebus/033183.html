It's a groaner...

&lt;&lt;  A man was blissfully driving his Kombi along the highway, when he
 saw  the Easter Bunny hopping across the middle of the road.  He swerved to
avoid hitting the bunny, but unfortunately the brakes needed rebuilding and
the
 rabbit jumped in front of his car and was hit. The basket of eggs went
flying
 all over the place.  Candy and that green stuff too.

  The driver, being a sensitive man as well as an animal lover, pulled over
to
 the side of the road, and got out to see what had become of the bunny
 carrying the basket.  Much to his dismay, the colorful bunny was dead.  The
 driver felt guilty and began to cry.

  A woman, in a convertible beetle, driving down the same highway saw the man
crying on the side of the road and pulled over.  She stepped out of her car
and asked the man what was wrong.

  &quot;I feel terrible,&quot; he explained.  &quot;I accidentally hit the Easter Bunny and
 killed him. There may not be an Easter because of me. What should I do?&quot;

   The woman told the man not to worry.  She know exactly what to do. She
went
 to her car trunk, and pulled out a spray can.  She walked over to the limp
 dead bunny, and sprayed the entire contents of the can onto the little furry
 animal. Miraculously the Easter Bunny came back to life, jumped up, picked
up
 the spilled eggs and candy, waved its paw at the two humans and hopped on
 down the road.  50 yards away the Easter Bunny stopped, turned around, waved
 and hoped on down the road another 50 yards, turned waved, hopped another 50
 yards and waved again!

 The man was astonished. He said to the woman, &quot;What in heaven's name is in
 your spray can?&quot;

 The woman turned the can around so that the man could read the label.

 It said: &quot;Hair Spray.  Restores life to dead hair.  Adds permanent wave.&quot;

 Sorry........

 Happy Easter and Passover &gt;&gt;
