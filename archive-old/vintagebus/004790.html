Subject: Throwout Bearing Fork Angst

Hello!

In my '60 DC, which broke its throwout fork two weeks ago, I supposedly have
an early 67 tranny mated to a Mexican 1600 DP with the standard Sachs 200mm
clutch.

I went to do the relatively simple procedure of replacing the throwout fork,
leaving the clutch disc and pressure plate assembly for another day (why
waste parts that work?).  First problem:  The local VW guy sent me (via
wifey) a Bugpack type1 kit for the throwout fork.  I go for it anyway, and
then find that the slot that is cut out for the affixing bolt is too close
to the spring side, so I go at it with the Dremel, and after getting that
set, noting that the arms of the fork are really heavy duty, and there are
little holes in them for the t/o bearing spring clips.  So far, I'm getting
uneasy, but not so much that I'm gonna give up.

So I put the engine back in, and find that it doesn't go in very
well....seems that all of a sudden there is NO free play in the
clutch...adjusted out all the way, but still not right.  So I fugure that
the angle of the T1 throwout forks is wrong, and take the engine out to see
if I can remedy the situation.  I end up pulling the engine from my '67
(which I was gonna do anyway...more on that story later), and stealing the
forks from that one.

Well, to make a long story short, the engine is back in with the throwout
forks from my '67, my '60's clutch cable seems to have shrunken, there is
still no free play in the clutch with it adjusted out all the way, and I'm
not sure if my tranny is from a bug or a bus.  The PO has not called me back
and I don't know where the numbers are.  (Where should I scrape the grease
off?)

Maybe the clutch was always like that, but it's not right, is it?

Gene
