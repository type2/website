&gt; 
&gt; Sounds good to me. Butt welds are a lot harder to master though. I'd hate
to
&gt; send an apprentice welder off to learn how to butt weld before he knew
how
&gt; to do lap welds.
&gt; 
Like you said...practice...practice...practice, before you start on the
bus.


&gt; Also, if you make the flange so that the seam is &quot;inside&quot; the bus, dirt
and
&gt; such wouldn't be a problem. &gt; 

Well, when I opened my rusty rockers that did not have any holes through to
the outside I took out large chunks of dirt in the shape of the
rocker...could have just been my bus that someone off road'ed. I still have
a chunk sitting on my garage wall.

&gt;When I do a lap weld, I weld the seam inside the
&gt; bus as well as the outer seam.

Wow, that is a neat trick for an outside rocker?  How do you get to the
inside (top part of the lap) when you are welding an outside rocker?  Are
you using the extra tall rockers so that you could get to the top seam from
the inside?  I agree if you can weld the top part of the lap then there is
no chance of water or drit getting in there.  But, why do the extra
welding, when if you do small spot welds (ala http://www.metwiz_dot_com) you
can easily do a but weld? Granted,more time involved in fitting, clamping,
triming though.  

Always more than one way to skin a cat though :-)
