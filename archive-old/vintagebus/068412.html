&gt; Get off the pavement and they're god-awful.  Sand, grass, mud...  But on
&gt; wet or dry pavement they're great.  Acceptable on hard dirt or gravel, but
&gt; don't try anything fancy or fun.  For that, I sure miss the yokohama 370

Oddly, I didn't find this.  They have no &quot;tooth&quot; in loose conditions which
means that they won't dig a hole when they spin.  For someone with a &quot;keep
it rolling&quot; technique in loose stuff they work well on an underpowered
vehicle like a bus.  Here in SoCal, we deal with a lot of sand, but not
much mud.  I don't think that I'd like them in slippary mud.
