Subject: cleaning clutch plates

I have had good results with the NON-factory approved method
of soaking the oiled up clutch in petrol and tossing a match
at it from a safe distance, then letting it burn itself out.
Repeat a couple of times, then wash clutch plate with soap
and water and dry. Roughen up any glaze with sand paper
before reinstalling clutch.

I had a spigot shaft seal blow in my 63 Dormobile back in
1996; dumped gear oil all over the clutch. I pulled the
engine at a campsite and burned the oil off the clutch and
reinstalled. I'm still using that same clutch plate.

AS I pointed out in the first line of this post. This method
is quite successful, but it is NOT factory approved. That is
to say, play with fire at your own risk!

[...]&gt; Clara,
&gt; Do you have good experience with cleaning off clutch
discs? I have an old
&gt; German clutch plate cover with a disc that began slipping.
I changed it and
&gt; put in a diaphram clutch and disc. It is harder to control
and wish I could
&gt; use the original one I have. I'm afraid that the oil
soaked disc may just
&gt; slip again. Is there a way to tell if the clutch cover is
any good besides
&gt; just looking at it closely for wear? Anything else to look
for?

&gt; &quot;I am pulling the d_at_mn motor back out of the 65 as the
clutch is slipping
&gt; and I gotta clean it off.   The first oil change is due,
so I pulled the
&gt; plug when I got home today, and it's dripping into the
bucket. hopefully it
&gt; was the oil pressure weirdness that made the clutch get
icky.   It was a
&gt; lovely clean new disc and 9 spring clutch, too.&quot;
