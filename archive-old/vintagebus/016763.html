Ha! even more reason to buy a dead solid '54 barndoor
ambulance that has been tastefully camperized. Limited
number of ambo bodies were produced from '52-2/'55.
Only a limited number exist in *any* condition in the
world. A fewer number are in North America. One is
ready to run from Arizona to California and back on
any given day ~and~ provide a comfortable nights sleep
while on the road. One has the options that mine have.
Only one is priced in the range that people are paying
for starter deluxe projects of any vintage. Don't
y'all think that train has left the station already?
Get over it for gosh sakes!... What are you going to
do with that deluxe anyway drive it to the store and
back~ leaving it in the parking lot? Pfft! Besides,
how can you camp with all of them silly seats in the
way?
And don't give me that uppity bull**** about
ambulances being on the bottom of the wish list. (I
remember when single cabs and panels were on the runt
end of the trend) This bus is able to do more than
look pretty in some collectors private museum. This
one could make it from Phoenix up to the Seattle
Vintage meet and/or Westfalia Acres given enough time.
(Lord knows I'd love to escape AZ and give it a go...)

I stand firm that my bus looked great next to the over
priced look-alike deluxe barns at the OCTO and held
it's ground amongst all of the 34 barn era buses in
attendance.

Amazingly, this bus still remains for sale.
Contact me if you have interesting partial trades plus
liquid assets to bargain with. Consideration given to
house painters, electricians, plumbers, roofers and
landscape craftspersons.
Straight cash and selected stocks accepted.
