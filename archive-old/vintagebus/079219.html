Craig we'll see you next year in our kid and pet friendly camp!

We had the pleasure of hosting Rachel, the Piqa's, JP, Greg Mogle and Tom
Buese on Thursday. Rob Laffon flew in to PHX and arrived at camp on Friday
nite.
Friday we cooked. Saturday Beto cooked. Sunday we cooked some more. Between
that it's running after toddlers. Chris George from Vegas brought his whole
family as well. Altogether there were 6 pre-schoolers orbiting Tom's EZ-UP for
3
days, with visiting kids from neighboring camp in the mix. They all had a
great
time I think.  Maybe I should cut down my Taquila consumption from 3 to 2
shots next year so I can avoid the unnecessary neon beer sign purchase at the
night auction. Or take 2 more shots so I'd pass out underneath a bus and can't
get near the stage. J/K.. it's great to support a good cause.

Almost got to say hi to Clara - walked past her swap and was gonna exchange
greetings but she's busy talking with someone else. Was gonna try again later
but the thought soon evaporated under the hot Sun. Everett and Greg Noble
stopped by Friday night, unfortunately the skewers were not ready yet. When
they
were, they were gone fast. Will make more next time.

The best part is to see all the friends at Jerome. That one cannot duplicate.
One can only attend.

Ricky
