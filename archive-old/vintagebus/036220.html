Subject: 55-58 Deluxe Interiors, Limited Production 
To: Vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

We are a few short weeks away from having a perfect reproduction of the 
center section of the 55-58 Deluxe door panel material seaming finished.
The seat material has been ready to go for several months. We are just now 
catching up on our restoration projects freeing up time to finish the 55-58 
door panel material needed for the 57 23 window that has finally entered the 
bodyshop and scheduled for completion by the Classic in June. 

We NEED to know how many people are interested in the seamed door panel 
material, this will be a ONE TIME production run. Limited to only those that 
reply within the next several weeks

DO NOT miss this opportunity if you want the real deal, for the finishing 
touch on that perfect restoration. This material is correct in color and 
texture, samples gladly sent on request.
