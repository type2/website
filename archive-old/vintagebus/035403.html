Subject: two tone paint- how do i do it right?
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

I have to get back to my paint shop by wednesday about this one- 
 How does a factory correct two tone paint job work in the sills, door edges,
inside, dashboard, etc.?  I am going with a factory two tone combination and
my bus was originally painted in a single color, so I don't have much to go
by.  Please don't slam me for my paint choices, I wouldn't dream of cutting
pieces off of my bus, but I AM going with incorrect colors.  Please help me do
it right.  If it matters, the colors are the 1961 green and grey combination.
Thanks,
Dan (Annapolis, MD)
