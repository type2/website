&gt; why not have taller reduction gears??  like 1-1
&gt; gears!!!  this sounds good!!and a simple solution???  what if some vw
&gt; shop made 1-1 reduction gears for us bus people who want to cruise at
&gt; 70mph???is this a possibility?? or an oversimplification of a problem
&gt; that will not work?? will 1-1 gears fit right in?? if they will, then
&gt; how tall can you go??
&gt; any thoughts out there??or am i just dreaming--

This idea has come up in the past, and as I recall the big difficulty
was the cost of tooling up to manufacture the gears.  I wonder how
many sets they would sell if the cost was $1000 a pop?  I guess that
taller ring gears are a more viable way to go in this case.
