&gt; Speaking of said latches... anybody need some?
&gt;
&gt; I have a whole pile of them... at least 1 set that is primo and no pits,
&gt; another that is so-so, and some that have the little latch part broke off.
&gt; Maybe a few others as well.
&gt;
&gt; I started collecting them when I thought my 59 should have them but decided
&gt; the through hole types were the correct ones.
&gt;
&gt; BTW, I have no rails... just the latches.
&gt;
&gt; Let me know.
