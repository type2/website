The original pop top canvas is hashed on my 66.  I am looking for a
replacement and have noticed many vendors.  I have seen replacements but

don't care for the bright yellow color.  Any feedback on who might carry
a
more &quot;natural&quot; looking color?
Thanks,

Don Thompson

Don,
I ordered mine from the Guild.  It is no where near the same color of
the original canvas.  This one is what I would call gold in color.  It
is a durable canvas with 3 screens sewn in place and uses velcro to
close them.  I am very happy with mine and it seemed to install easy.
