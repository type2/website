&lt;&lt; A guy named Earl here in town got sideswiped in his '52 Panel (again!) and
 could use the following:
 1. Passenger door
 2. Passenger rear corner or, preferably, Passenger rear side from corner to
 cargo door pillar.  I believe the lower 1/2 is all that is needed.
 
 He would prefer Barndoor panels but will take others.
 
 Prefer location close to Phoenix, AZ, to minimize shipping. &gt;&gt;

Damn, he sure is asking for a lot. What else would he like while i'm out 
there with the saw cutting up a bd with salvageable metal?
