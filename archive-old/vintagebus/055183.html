If JP has a 58 # 272409 then I guess my SC is a 58 as well.
My engine plate Chassis # is 279702. It has the no hump engine lid. I thought 
it was a 57. It came from the Holbrook AZ area with next to no rust.

Thanks to all who attended B&amp;B. you made it a real show.
ABC did start the B&amp;B show. They made the trophies and gave us the nerve to 
do it.
Thank you ABC members.

&gt; Body number 272409 (Behind front seat, passenger side) is October of '57
&gt; production.
&gt; Chassis number 272409 (Engine compartment) is August of '57 production.
&gt; 
&gt; Either way it is a '58 model year so I think it should have the larger round
&gt; tail lights.

&gt; &gt; &gt;    Got a call from JP, he made it home with his new
&gt; &gt; &gt; 58 single cab
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Yep, I got home with a lighter wallet, and the
&gt; &gt; singlecab that John Howard found.  It turns out that
&gt; &gt; it may be a 1957, because it was built before the end
&gt; &gt; of August, 1957, and it should have the earlier
&gt; &gt; taillights, I think (re the spec guide).  Anybody have
&gt; &gt; a better guess?  The id number is 272409.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Got the original title, and the engine is correct and
&gt; &gt; runs!  Gonna get a prestige New Mexico plate with the
&gt; &gt; original plate number, so it will only have had one
&gt; &gt; number ever!  Next up; making it stop.
&gt; &gt;
