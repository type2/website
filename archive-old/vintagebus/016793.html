I had my bumpers galvanized, so i should never have to worry about any rust
with them again. The place I brought them to-sandblasted, then acid dipped,
then galvanized.

I plan on getting them powder coated, when I can afford it. The brightest
white that they have. 

I had the same done to my rims, belly pan, roof rack, and vw symbol.

Now they kind of have that primer gray look to them(a little more silvery)
