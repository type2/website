Hi All,
Who would have thought that replacing your bus front window rubber will make
it stop raining. 
 
Yesterday evening after curing the fresh paint in the window sills with a
portable heater in 40 degree weather. (I had the heater blasting hot air
inside the Panel's cab with the two window openings masked off with heavy
craft paper to stop the cold air from getting in. Took one and a half days
to fully dry. Pretty cool!) 
 
Slicked up the pull cord with a glycerin product and it took three tries to
get the first window in. Dawn and I forgot how to do it, it's been a while.
So, finally got the thing in. Remember to start at the top of the window it
goes a lot faster and easier. Also, cross your string it helps start the
process. We put the second window in. *pound, pound, pound... POP!* it sets
into place. Now to seal the buggers. 
 
Get a caulking gun and a tube of roofing adhesive. They don't call it
roofing tar anymore, it has a new fancy techno' name, 208 Compound Roofing
Adhesive. Just &quot;tar in a can&quot; if you ask me. Cut off the smallest end of the
caulk nozzle and proceed to flatten out the nozzle with a hammer. (this is
so you can squeeze it between the rubber and the window sill. Next take a
super dull putty knife (so you don't scratch the paint) and push a corner of
it in the seam between the rubber and the window sill, pry back the rubber
flap a little and shove the flattened caulk nozzle in the open space. Start
at the top of the seam a slowly run a bead all the way around the sides and
bottom of the window rubber seam. It is really tight and you might have to
do some coaxing with the edge of the putty knife to get it going. I just had
Dawn pull the putty knife in front of the caulk nozzle while I ran the bead
so the nozzle stayed close inside the seam. Don't worry if the tar oozes
out, cause it is easily wiped off with kerosene, paint thinner, etc. and a
rag. Make sure to wear gloves and grubby clothing. 
 
Clean off the mess with a rag, wipe the glycerin from the window glass, and
put the wiper shafts back on, Done.
No sooner than we finished replacing the front rubber in the panel, it quit
raining. That night while watching the news they forecasted clear skies till
Sunday. It has been raining nonstop for the past month. Damn, I wanted to
see how well the new rubber keeps out the rain. (The only time the whole
year I want it to rain cats and dogs!)
 
My conclusion to make it stop raining is to replace your leaking window
seals and get new wiper blades. it's sort of like washing your car and then
it starts raining, but only backwards.
 
&quot;Caulk it up to good karma!&quot; :-)
