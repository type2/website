Subject: RE: [VB] metal flakes in oil! Help! - Painting engine case

There was a shop in Canada during the 70's, (don't know if it exists
anymore), that used to do that with the 40hp blocks. It was quite the
business for formula Vee racers when 40hp blocks were becoming rare and
formula Vee were restricted to that size engine. They exported a lot of
blocks to Europe and Australia for formula Vee also. There is steel stamp in
the case on the front side of the bell housing. You can tell these blocks
when apart by all the welding in the main ribs and around #3 oil path in the
bell housing. If you come across any, please take some pictures for the
website.

&gt;Now as for powdercoating. I don't think I want to use an engine case
&gt;that has been heated to 400 degrees for a couple of hours for the
&gt;purpose of being encased in ceramic, which by the way is a great insulator.

Wilson recommends a cure for warped overheated cases damaged by detonation
or run without the cooling fan:
&quot;Sometimes , such excessive heat practically remolds the case so the bores
are
drastically out of line. To save such a case, torque it together and bake at
425 F
( 218 C ) for two hours. Then turn off the oven and let the case cool to
room temperature.
Don't move the case while it's cooling. Once cool, repeat this heat /
cooling cycle.
This will actually reshape the case to where align-boring the main and cam
bearing bores
is possible.&quot;

Additionally, welding is a viable repair solution to broken magnesium and
aluminum alloy cases.
Welding, as you know, puts intense heat into the parent material in a
localized area.
This is a considerable topic to discuss.

One further consideration to ponder, powdercoat is not ceramic.
