&lt;&lt; I tried to put a header on the motor and they said it was for a 1500 to 
1600 and it is not close at all what muffler can I put on it do they make a 
header for a 1200 or 1300 ? &gt;&gt;
Hi Charles,
Just install a stocker bus 40 HP muffler.  It will run cooler, better MPG, 
and not monoxide you to death which is why stock bus muffler goes out past 
the left rear corner to get rid of the exaust into the airstream after 1958 
instead of a cloud of it behind the bus.  Before this VW had just used an 
earlier type 1 muffler.  Eric&amp;Barb
