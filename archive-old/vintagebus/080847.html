Subject: I'll be on the East Coast [late Friday content]

All,

Starting later this week, I will be on the University of Tulsa's team
at the Tour de Sol, a race for alternative-fueled vehicles, in New
Jersey and New York.  The race Web site is at
http://www.nesea_dot_org/transportation/tour/ .  Come out, look at the
cars, say hi!

Bus content: There have been a couple of different electric Vanagon
conversions through the years at the race.  One was done by high
school students -- most of the race entries are done by colleges.
There are also usually some water-pumper VW diesels running on veggie
oil, both in the original VW bodies and custom-built cars.

Matt Roberds
