  This bus had been for sale for ever for 300 dollars and the PO couldn't
give it away. I traded for it to get the panel doors and some of the other
good sheet metal off of it. So far I have helped 3 buses not counting mine
and will be able to have a few parts made off of the other good stuff off of
it and help a couple more buses including a BD, a worthy sacrifice for a bus
that had it's torsion housing already cut out of it.

Oh, that sounds like a real brilliant idea. You gonna replace those parts 
later?
