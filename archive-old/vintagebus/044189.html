OK, I got the '66 Camper a new carb and now she purrs, well, &quot;rumbles&quot; might be the more appropriate word!  Anyway this bus has a 71 engine in it (I think) and the engine looks exactly like the one in my 71 Super beetle except for the position of the little plastic fuel filter.  I suspect the one on the 66 bus is in the wrong place, but I want to confirm this fact before I go changing it.  On the beetle the filter is on the fuel line between the fuel pump and the carb, however, on the bus it is located on the fuel line between the tank and the fuel pump BEFORE the line enters the fuel pump.  Which of these is right\wrong.  My bet is that it goes AFTER the fuel pump BEFORE the carb, but I want to be sure.  And if it is in the wrong place, is this likely to affect performance at all??
