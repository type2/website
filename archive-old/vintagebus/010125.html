I wasn't complaining about the prices per se, by mentioning the eBay copies
I was trying to justify my placing them online.  It is a bit of a gray area
after all...I figured if somebody can sell a xerox of a manual, it was &quot;ok&quot;
for me to put them online.

Steve doesn't sell his copies for profit, only covers costs -- I gladly paid
him for my copy, and will buy from him again when I have some spare $$ :-)

Point well taken though, copies are expensive.  Luckily, electrons are
&quot;free.&quot;

&gt; FWIW I photocopied a 72 bug parts list, and the cost at Kinko's was about
$75, regardless of the hours it took me.  You can't put the originals
through the autocopier as it will mangle the pages and I had to give the
original back in good shape.  Yes that is much fatter than the early bus
lists, so the photocopying cost for thinner books is less.  Steve Howell on
the list was selling xeroxes for about $35, which is eminently reasonable,
he had a 71 bug edition, and a 67 bus edition I think.
