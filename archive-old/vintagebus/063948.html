Subject: RE: [VB] 50MPH Whine--??

I've seen this on FORD and Chevy rears. When I got my bus trans done, I
specifically asked for new R and P (4.12 ratio), cost a lot to find
them, but the trans is super silent. Now just to stop the damn drip!
I do believe the 'rewear' is a truth, and a possible cause of whine,
also establishing correct alignment with respect to the already realized
wear seems to be near impossible without new gears.
I run into a lot of straightaxle US car rears that whine like this,
until they get new gears, or someone fixes the pinion angle, which I
guess we cannot adjust.

A very experienced tranny builder here said this often happens.  He
claimed that when you re-adjust the R&amp;P to factory specs (ie take some
of the slop out of it) the ring and pinion are taken out of their
'established' wear
pattern
and that some noise results....I am sort of waiting to see whether they

'wear in'
again...............
