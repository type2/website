At the risk of being tied to a stake by the list, enough Bob Hoover. I once
e-mailed Bob, before I knew about the list. I tried to be polite and ask him
a simple question about rebuilding an engine.

In short he was a D**K. He told me I should drive a Toyota and not a VW for
a daily driver and that was what he does. When I got on the list I saw how
everyone praising this guy. Maybe this lead to his arrogance. I can also see
now how he probably gets about a million e-mails a day with dumb questions.
Maybe he was just having a bad day and took it out on me.

But because of his self praise and A**hole attitude, I DELETE EVERYTHING
from, to, or about Bob Hoover. I've kept this to myself for many months, but
with this new thread I just can't take it anymore.

I didn't save the e-mail I got from him so don't ask what was in it. It has
been over a year ago and I can't remember it word for word. I'm sure he may
be a nice guy. But I've had one experience with him and it wasn't a good
one.
That's all I have to say, you will hear no more.

Rick
