Subject: Re: [VB] flipseat

Is there a good way to move the partition back on a bus to gain more leg
room? I am 6'4&quot; and have a 60 non walk-thru bench seat bus, but the
partition has been hacked ( not by me! : ) I could use some more leg
space up front, head room too but that's a different topic. Would there
be a good way to install a donor partition a few inches back and still
structurally fortify that area? or maybe some kinda rail just to hang the
seat back on. just wondering... 

Thanks

&gt; From what we understand from those who have driven a non-walk thru 
&gt; with the 
&gt; cab divider cut out is that cracks happen around the pillars behind 
&gt; the front 
&gt; doors due to flexing there.  Extra central belly pans will not help 
&gt; this.
