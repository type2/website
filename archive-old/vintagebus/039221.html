True, but from my experiences as a carb gets older the richer it runs.  Once
rebuilt it will correct this overrich condition in the wrong time/places.
The last one I had that needed rebuilt did a fuel barf so rich it choked out
the engine and I could not get it started again.

If John is still running rich form the rebuild it should be easy to back in
the mixture screw and adjust the air volume accordingly.

I like my plugs to tell me a story with a gray burn on contact arm and light
black on the OD of the plug base.  I do this perfectly with the 135 main.
You can do 132.5 if you want it a little leaner, but I would not advise any
smaller.  The stock Solex jets are way too small from my experiences.

HUH?  i thought he was already having a black smoke problem and wanted to
decrease it.

&gt; Also at this time it is a good idea to get a larger main jet so the heads
&gt; run a little wetter and cooler.  I recommend a 135.
