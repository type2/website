 I was tied up in a 'death match' with my new insurance agent and
 underwriters today concerning my '67 (the only way to get unrestricted
 insurance with comp/collision on my bus was to in the end  change carriers
 on the Ch*vy and F*rd as well, but I digress) and the value of a '67 bus
 came up.   The CPI book value of a '67 type 22 bus was as follows:
 Fair condition $2375
 Good condition $4650
 Excellent condition $6800
 
 I am presuming that the 'CPI book' is comprable to the 'Kelly Blue Book'.
 The definition of fair, good and excellent is open to interpertation and
 ultimately up to an appraiser (which I still must see before I get the full
 coverage going).
 
 
 ... not a great help but at least a pointer in the right direction

 '67 to be considered (by me at least) in 'good condition'
  &gt;&gt;
there is a 66 standard or kombi here in OLY WA FS for $2000, funky grey 
paint, needs interior, supposedly runs great, didn't look too close, but no 
big dents or obvious gaping rust.  seems fair.
