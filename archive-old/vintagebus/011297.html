&gt;  So the brake pedal's been kinda low lately.  Today it went to the floor.
&gt;  Doh!  Fluid reservoir empty.  Refill, drive home with hand reaching for
&gt;  e-brake.
&gt;  
&gt;  Looked like the left front side was leaking.  Pulled off that wheel,
&gt;  everything looks fine.  Right front side looks really wet from the back.
&gt;  So, pulled off that one too.  Uh-oh.  The nuts that held the wheel on were
&gt;  really loose, I just spun them off by hand.  So I'm guessing both the
&gt;  bearings are garbage?  The drum was really hard to get off, too, it just
&gt;  wanted to tilt back and forth.  An hour or so of hammering and 
sweet-talking
&gt;  later, it came off.

okay, some people may not agree with me.  as Muir said, some people replace 
anything in sight at the the first sign of any problems, which while helps, 
is not always strictly neccessary.   If you have leaks in the wheel area, and 
there is fluid all over the shoes, this may well cause things to stick and be 
hard to remove the drum.  Also if the drum gets that nice ridge just out from 
where the shoes are (you can get around that be undoing the shoe adjustment a 
tad.   Anyway- are you bearings toast?  look at them!!!! clean off the 
bearing so you can see the rolli bits- nice and smooth?  or flakes of metal 
coming off them?  Look at the races( the circle the bearings roll in) they 
should be smooth and shiny.  Pits are bad on bearings or the races.  

are the old shoes scraped from the drum beaing pulled off against them?   

definately when reinstalling make sure you have new lock plates, and the nuts 
are adjusted properly and locked against each other, or if you are using the 
latter kind with the allen screw lock, that it is snugged so the axle nut 
wont loosen (or tighten).

&gt;  
&gt;  Ok, so this is the really bad wheel.  wet black crud everywhere, the rubber
&gt;  seal on the top wheel cylinder is torn and sitting off to the side.  It's a
&gt;  mess.
&gt;  
&gt;  I haven't done brakes in awhile, so I have some dumb questions.  I think 
the
&gt;  correct thing to do here would be to replace all four front wheel 
cylinders.
&gt;  Not to mention the bearings.  But of course this happens at a time when I'm
&gt;  flat broke.  What would be the minimum &quot;just-for-now&quot; fix-it job?  Is there
&gt;  anything I'm overlooking here?
&gt;  ===============
remove the nasty soaked shoes, you need a new set.

remove the piston from the wheel cylinders on that side (I put an oil pan 
under neath to catch the drips)   take a rag and a flashlight and look inside 
the cylinder.  okay, wipe the old fluid out so you can see better.  The 
cylinder should be nice and smooth- no pits./   Pits are bad.  if they are 
very slight you may be able to use a brake hone and rebuild the wheel 
cylinders, but if they are more than very slight you will need to buy new 
ones.  If you can feel the pit with you finger/finger nail after honing, the 
fluid will seep past the seal and make a mess, and the brakes wont worrk right

oh, to rmove the pistons, you may want to have a friend push the brake pedal, 
gently, while you watch the cylinders- the pistons shpould move out- keep the 
first out one from popping out all the way, and the other will move out.  
then you can easiy remove them.   

If the outer seal is torn, it is just a dust seal, dont worry.   If you have 
fluid on the outside of the piston, that means it is leaking/oozing past the 
inner seal (ring) and will shortly spill, so it needs help before it fails in 
an emergency

if the piston is stuck, you can if stuck in no wheres ville, make it round 
with a file and sandpaper (BTDT), but do yourself a favour and buy new

a front wheel cylinder has a piston with a rubber ring around it.  (rears for 
a bus have two pistons) if you look at the old ringskirt, you will see where 
it has been worn.  Okay- rebuild kits are cheap, a brake hone is about $25 at 
schmucks in WA state, it is fun to use, and saves money, but if the old 
cylinders have more than very minor pits, they must be replaced for you 
safelt functioning brakes.   They must be smooth and shiny before reassembly 
with new seals.  

so at a minimum, you need to check that out- if the cylinders look 
salvagable, get a brake hone, rebuildt kits, and new shoes.  And of course 
pull the other sides brakes apart and check them out. 

an accident costs loads more than new wheel cylinders.  Be safe.  Knowing how 
to judge the difference between good used and bad used must be replaced parts 
can save money, but do make sure you see what the difference is, and why, 
which means understanding how the system works.
