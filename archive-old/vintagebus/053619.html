Subject: Re: [VB] bus cover

Hi,

I'll admit to you that this morning I used black plastic sheets taped to 
the front and rear, then covered with a blue neon tarp (held down with 
bungy cords) covered with a tattered cheapo-paper van cover (bought at 
WalMart).

If I could afford a $200 cover, I'd spend it on a paint job!

Conrad

&gt;&gt; i tried to order a cover for my '67 bus from vw california imports but 
&gt;&gt; they
&gt;&gt; said they stopped making them. anyone have any idea where i can get 
&gt;&gt; one-i
&gt;
&gt; Okay, try this:
&gt;
&gt; Goto:
&gt;
&gt; http://www.jcwhitney_dot_com/catsubpic.jhtml?CATID=3004
&gt;
&gt; which is their car cover page. If the above link doesn't work, goto 
&gt; their
&gt; homepage, and SEARCH for car cover, which takes you to above.
&gt;
&gt; Then, goto the bottom of the page, to the WOLF CAR COVERS
&gt; link, and click on:
&gt;
&gt; CLICK HERE FOR PRODUCT AND PRICING DETAILS
&gt;
&gt; Select the year and make (VOLKSWAGEN), then hit NEXT,
&gt;
&gt; Then select the model (MICROBUS)
&gt;
&gt; Then select the fabric type. If you're serious about your cover, select
&gt; one of the top two covers.
&gt;
&gt; Check your order, then hit BUY, and you're on yer way!
