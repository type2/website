Ive dealt with Dan a few times, no problems whatsoever.
Regardless of what negative is posted, it will NOT change my views of dealing 
with him in the future.
Ive had people bitch at me for taking too long to ship stuff, hope I dont get 
torn apart on the list! ;-)

&lt;&lt;Perhaps you two could discuss this over the phone in a mature manner rather 
than post derogatory comments to the list. Sometimes it can be hard to 
describe parts &amp; things through email. Don't forget how much negative 
postings can seriously effect someone's reputation (both the poster and the 
postee).


Just a thought :-)
