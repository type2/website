Subject: Re: [VB] The truth about FC vehicles

Very interesting chat in the lower section of the page.
Consider that it took the Europeans almost 2000+ years to deforest Europe
burning trees for heating and cooking fuel.
The Bubonic Plague slowed things a bit.
We currently have about 10% of the forest remaining in the US after a
mere 300 years.
I'm guessing that out oil reserves are somewhere in the same condition
with only about 10% remaining after only 100 years.
The original Japanese and Asian cars arriving in the US in the early 70s
were small and got good mileage.
It would interesting to see how our fuel requirements may have been
different if they had remained small.
