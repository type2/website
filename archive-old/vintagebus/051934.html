Subject: [VB] Part Needed at Havasu


if anyone out there has a very good 68-71 bus rear engine
hanger/crossmember, i need one for a bus i'm working on. 
it must be straight and not rusted out. mounts irrelevant. 
i'd like to pick it up at havasu. if anyone could bring one along, please
let me know price so i can bring some cash.
thanks,
jon
