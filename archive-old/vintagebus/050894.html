Subject: Re: [VB] Haven't you always wanted a VW Bus calendar?  Here's your 
 chance

Speaking of calendars, anybody heard from Sam Toll after he posted here
last December regarding his calendar?  I sent him a picture, sent him a
check, still no calendar and the check hasn't been cashed.  No reply to
my follow-up email.  Anybody got the birds-eye lowdown on Sam's
situation?

&gt; &quot;Here's your chance to get the 2002 VW Bus calendar
&gt; being created by the Full Moon Bus Club. After never
&gt; being able to find a VW Bus Calendar, we decided to
&gt; create our own. It is a 14-month calendar, which makes
&gt; it good through February 2003. Since this is the FIRST
&gt; year for the calendar, all you have to do is send
&gt; $15.00 for each calendar (including mailing costs) to
&gt; the following address: Rodney Kindlund, RodKraft
&gt; Studio, 477 Panther Branch Rd., Alexander, NC
&gt; 28701-9662
