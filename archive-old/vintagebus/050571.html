&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt; Whoops!  the shift linkage is just above the front beam, not through it so it
&gt; can be left alone.  Though while the front beam is out it is a best time with
&gt; the added working room to take it apart and grease everything.  Plus before
&gt; you install the new front beam it is alot easier to redo the center
&gt; pin/bushings.   Eric&amp;Barb

Nope, you were right the first time B&amp;E.  I was really worried that it
would be the hardest part on my 67, but aerokroil, torch and luck got it
off.  I put antiseize on that stuff when I put it back together.
