Subject: Flywheel oil seal update

Thanks for the infor everyone,

I got the main seal and 'o' ring from German &amp; Swedish (our regular VW
parts shop).
They cost 60p each and did the trick - no more oil leak. The old FW seal
didn't look to bad,
but I guess it could be that combined with a &quot;flat&quot; 'o' ring and I also
found that the crank
was missing it's thin paper gasket (the dowel holed one) which might
also account for some
leakage. I also cleaned the sump with some gas and a stiff brush, it's
nice to have a clean, dry
sump - for a while at least : )

Job done.

Lee.
