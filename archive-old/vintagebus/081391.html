Subject: Small Nut to Freeway Flyer

So ... I have my OG transmission out of my bus and another small nut in it. 
I want to convert the original to a freeway flier and continue to use my 
redux boxes.  What should I consider doing.  Does it make sense to buy what 
I need - and take the tranny and stuff to a shop to have it done. Think any 
tranny shop could do the work - not too many VW tranny shops here in Eastern 
Ontario.  What are my best options?  Ronnie - does one of your combos 
include a small nut tranny?

TIA
