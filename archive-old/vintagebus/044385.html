Subject: FS: '61 DC at Ennis Bug-In

A buddy of mine is planning to bring his '61 DC to Ennis,TX Bug-In on 
may 6th to sell. I don't know how much he's gonna want for it, but 
it'll be there. It's complete with all the gates and everything. 
Rebuilt rear-end, all new brakes front and back....nice non-bondo'd 
nose, body is in primer. Has the little taillights and bullet turn 
signals, bumpers, rear-apron, ect.  Would be a GREAT truck with some 
body/paint work. If anyone's looking for a bullet signal double-cab, 
this'll be the place to find one for sure.
