Subject: screw tabs on popout frames?
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.10.10002081703090.42521-100000_at_users.anet-stl_dot_com&gt;

hi all,

i couldnt find an answer to this question in the archives, so i thought
i'd try here...

the popout frames on my new-to-me 61 micro are all good and more or less
rust free except 2 of em have the tabs that the latches screw on to broken
off.

My 67 kombi has trashed popout frames but all the little latch-attachment 
plates are good.

now, how do i get the latch things from the bad frames to the good ones.
specifically:
what is the best way to get those buggers off, a chisel?
what is the best way to reattach to the frames i have?

Can i drill and tap the frames and use popout frame screws to hold
those mounting tabs onto the frames (not stock, but later on when i
disassemble the popouts i can easily plug weld those holes and have a nice
finished product.)

I was thinking of running a bead with the mig, but that would be uglier
than just doing it with a couple of screws i think...

Brazing is the best option i guess, but i cant do that without
dissasembly...

spot welding is what the factory did???

anyone have any insight? i hope to have this van on the road by spring
camping season... first campout the end of march... tick tick, hehe.

peas,

Steve
