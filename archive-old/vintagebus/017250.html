&gt; &lt;&lt; I went the same route as Paul, I have my bus for
&gt; fun and a New Beetle for
&gt;  &quot;necessary transportation&quot;.
&gt;  And for a couple of different reasons. First of
&gt; all, I think of my bus as a 
&gt; unique
&gt;  vehicle with a finite lifespan.
&gt;  I save it for weekends and the days I do drive it
&gt; to work are &quot;special&quot;. 
&gt; People
&gt;  see it parked outside and usually mention it.
&gt;  The NB is nice, but it's &quot;just another production
&gt; car&quot; and therefore if it 
&gt; breaks
&gt;  or gets trashed I can replace it pretty
&gt; effortlessly. &gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt;         Well, hey, I'm not the only one!  Kudos for
&gt; the post, I think that it 
&gt; works perfectly. :)

I drive a 00 GTI 1.8t most of the time. but when my
bus is running i'll probably be driving that almost
all the time. it think i have the fastest VW model eer
made, and the slowest.
