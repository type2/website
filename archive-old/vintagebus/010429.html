I'm just entertaining ideas right now to help me get thru this awful winter.

What would the nearest commercial airport be for Lake Havasu?  Is it big
enough that it has one?  Are there any listees that would be willing to be
my transportation while I'm down there? Maybe someone has 2 buses and they
can't decide which bus to take so they could use a driver for the 2nd one?

Keep me posted...
