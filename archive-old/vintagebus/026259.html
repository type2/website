By the way. . . the law man cannot simply tow away your auto to the
crusher without giving you fair notice. . . that is clearly
unconctitutional (my laymans opinion). I know this because the city of
College Park, Maryland once towed my wifes car without giving her proper
notice. At the time she wasn't yet a practicing attorney. . . just a
young law student. But she put the fear of God into the Mayor of that
city (something about unlawful seizure of  property and the bill of
rights) and he had me come down to get the keys. Once there, I asked if
they would be so kind as to let me see the mayor. When I went in, just
for grins, I told him he still owed her an apology!! :) His blood
pressure skyrocketed, just as I expected it would. His face beat red, he
ordered me out of his office. . . and I calmly left with a bigassed grin
on my face.

When I went down to the impound lot and got the car, the big fat tow
truck drivers were installing Jensons in the tow truck. One of em got
ran over. Whooooooops. :)
