Subject: Re: [VB] Concerns of heat, gearing, and big engines.

&lt;&lt;At 55 you are not loading the engine as highly as at 65. Wind
resistance goes up with, I believe, by the cube of the speed.  That
means your primary drag (wind resistance) has increased by 1.65 times
from 55 to 65 mph. That is a large increase in engine load. That is
why you don't overheat at 55 and do at 65.&gt;&gt;

So then, I guess the fix for this would be to mount a giant sryofoam
cone to the front of the bus, eh??!!
