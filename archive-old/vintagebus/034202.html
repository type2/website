Darn, getting two parked-for-2-year VW's running (that had various parts
removed for other VW's &lt;grin&gt;), and moving out of a major 2 car garage was a
lot more effort than I anticipated.

We aren't leaving for Lake Havasu until today.  So if you see a 1967 Westy
heading down I5 with Washington plates in the next 36 hours... could be us!
Blue tackle (parts) boxes on the rear roof rack.

Thanks to all for support.  Current ETA in Lake Havasu is 9:00pm Thursday.
Had hoped to make it sooner to help ronnie with the fire, but we did our
best and it was just a ton of work.  Having to give up a 1400 square foot
house and move into a 200 square foot storage unit... not fun!

Should be on the road at 1:00pm.  No e-mail for next 36 hours...  Will be in
Havasu most of December.  Hope to meet some more of you great volks.
