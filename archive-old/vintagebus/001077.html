Hi All,

ebay must bring out the impulsiveness in people... why else.  (I have to
admit to a few dumb buys in the past and then realized that the description
wasn't exactly what I thought it was).

But, to jump on the other side of the fence, I can say that if you want the
part, and can't find it, ebay may be the only choice.  I have listed parts
that I need for my restoration in the wanted sections on places like
type2_dot_com only to get absolutely no responses.  So you say &quot;Go to a swap
meet&quot;.... well, I for one, live where there are no swap meets.

To alleviate this problem, how about if some of you that have the
opportunity to go to the meets, when you go, look for a few parts for me!!!
I'll send you a list and would be glad to pay you for your troubles.

BTW, any NW listees that are reading this, are there any meets coming up in
Boise, Portland, Yakima, or Seattle???


So, in the end, to the person that paid the ~500 for Gregs fans, I hope you
like them.
