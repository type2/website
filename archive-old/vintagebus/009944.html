I'd say if you can install it and make it look good (like a factory
installation) without rivets and screws sticking out all over the place, go
for it!  Save the piece of metal you cut out so that should you ever want to
patch the hole, you've got a piece that you could tack weld some tabs to or
at least use for a template simply but scaling the size up an inch.

I would normally tell you to do whatever the heck you want but since you
asked the list.....  :-)
