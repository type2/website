Hi Scott-

As far as I know the brass plate that you are referrring to did indeed begin with the So-42's. I have never seen a similar plate on so-23's, 33's 34's etc.

And yes that farbrik number is indeed the number yours was in the whole westfalia schema, i.e. how many had been made.

Trivia time my 65 westfalia has fabrik number 0014 making it the 14th so-42 westfalia ever made.

Does anybody know when the brass plates at the bottom corner of the z-bed
where started?? Is this an SO42 and up practice only, or does it date back
to SO23s and SO34s?

If I have a '66 Westfalia with the Fabrik # 5000 engraved on the plate does
this mean that it is the 5000th Westfalia of the SO42 series?

Trivia: Based on Thom's registry of Westfalias the Fabrik # would indicate
approx 70 a day where made at the factory. Sound right?? Any Westfalia
historians in the crowd care to voice an opinion.....

Thanks in advance for any info you might have....

Scott
'67 Westy
