Subject: How'd they keep the louvred windows sealed?

How were the louvre windows sealed? On my '67 Westfalia they're just glass-to-glass, and leak air like crazy. Was there a seal in there originally?

Eventually trying to keep the heat in - yeah, you don't need it much in San Diego, but hey, it does get a little cold at times. How do you do it in the colder states?
