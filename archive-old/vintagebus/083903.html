&gt; Can anyone with a part number available, tell me about
&gt; this transmission?  113 301 263 This number is stamped
&gt; into the rubber close to the mounts.

That's the part number of the rubber mount.  If there is
no letter after the &quot;263&quot;, Google says it's a mount for
Bug/Ghia up to '72, all splitties, and Type 3's to '68.
If it fits the transmission and fits the car, then there's
a reasonable chance that the transmission was originally
in one of the above vehicles.  It doesn't tell you much
about what the gear ratios are, though.  The transmission
case part number should be cast into the metal and will
_probably_ be something like 113 305 0xx or 113 305 1xx.
This should give you more of a hint as to what the
transmission was when it left Germany.  To get the gear
ratios, the most reliable method is probably to spin the
input shaft by hand 10 or 20 times and see how much the
output shafts turn, in each gear.

&gt; Further more, should a 1500 SP from a 66 bus bolt up?

Maybe.  Probably the most likely thing that would stop
them bolting up is if the engine has a 200 mm flywheel
and the transmission case hasn't been clearanced for it.
Easy enough to check with a ruler.
