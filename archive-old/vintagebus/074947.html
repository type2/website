Subject: RE: And the saga begins

  The bus is going to John Jones for rust repair and paint. I am sure he
will be contacting you for outer belly pans, inner c channels, front
outriggers and the front c channel, otherwise it is a very clean bus. I will
try to take photo's of the foam filled rockers and the beautiful fiberglass
work done by the PO to repair the existing rust problems!!!
  The goal is to have this DELUXE totally RESTORED by the Christmas
holidays. Parts are allready being ordered, as is the interior and other
misc. parts to help expedite the restoration.
