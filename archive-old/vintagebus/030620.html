&gt; Hi all,
&gt; I would just like to inquire from all you knowing minds....
&gt; Does ANYONE know the source for the &quot;Shade covers&quot; that someone is making
&gt; for the bus cargo doors ??Its mostly a fancy cover that sits on top of the
&gt; cargo doors when they are partially opened...I believe that there is also
&gt; tent of some sort being made for the rear hatch.....
