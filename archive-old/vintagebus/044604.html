Hi Isaiah,
It does kind of sound like a problem with the coil or condensor.  
Unfortunitly certain problems are not easy to just figure out.  Doubly so 
when it is intermintent kind of trouble.  Then it is just a matter of 
replacing one part after another with known good parts until the problem goes 
away.   Eric&amp;Barb
