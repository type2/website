Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Maaco Paint job

&lt;&lt;I hate to admit it, but back when I had a few bucks in my pocket, it
was
really easy to get good service by the bribe method.  Does this say
something
about our service economy, or are people just really lazy without
incentive?&gt;&gt;

I think maybe it says more about corporate philosophy. That painter is
probably bairly making a living. Wouldnt it be great for the consumer
and for the worker if there was an inspection following the paint job
and a bonus to the painter on each job done to inspection standards. Too
many companies wish to keep all the profits rather than rewarding
exemplary performance.

I have a friend that owns a sub shop. What she earns off the place is
obscene. Yet she won't pay her employees more and is constantly
lamenting the poor quality of employees and the constant turn over.

I guess its up to us to bribe these people to get what we deserve in the
first place.
