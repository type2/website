AFFECTED???  She, it or whatever....RIPPED OFF several of my good friends.
she took their mone and never gave em the time of day when the approached
her personnally at later Bus events.  Not even so much as an apology and
attempt to make things right.  If she has your money and her business
happens to get &quot;affected&quot; again......
later
