Subject: Roof Rack Locks

Hiya list,
Does anyone know of a lock for the early bus racks, the ones with the
horseshoe-type clamps?  Since they have a wingnut bolt that screws down into
the clamp, I can't use the normal types of locks.

My son's 66 Sundial has a half-rack, the same kind of early rack as mine.
It has a link of chain welded to each of the wingnut screws, and a lock
placed thru the link of chain and locked onto the foot of the rack.  Pretty
simple, but it works.  I'd like to be able to disuade thiefs with bolt
cutters as well.  Any suggestions?

Thank you,
Ed
