Quit trying to find it in parts stores, and go to The Man:
almost any size town will have a dealer for petroleum products... Austin
has maybe 4. Even a small town will have one for the tractors, etc.
Get either a bucket or a barrel :)

Price will be cheaper, AND they will know what they are talking about - I
learned WHY not to use G5 from the guys at Arnold Oil here in Austin: &quot;Ya
got yeller metal in that tranny, eh? Yeah, 5 will eat it hehehehheh.&quot;
