Hi all,

I was wondering if the only door that will fit the &quot;Crew&quot; door on my 66 Crew
cab is another crew door from the same year.  Esentially, I am having a hard
time find a straight, fairly rust free third door, but I have been able to
locate many cargo doors from same year Kombi's or Westies.

Thanks!
