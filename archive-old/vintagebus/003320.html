Since we're on the topic of beams, does anyone know how much a beam weighs?
I'm considering one from a fellow listee thats a couple-few states away.
Also a question of how they're shipped.  The last time I mail ordered a
type1 beam, the shipper just slapped an address label on the beam itself and
dropped it off at UPS.  Could it still be this simple?  Any info would be
appreciated.
