These new GPS chingaderos . . . Global Position System . .

As in &quot;I know where I am&quot; . . . :-) a concept I find 
very hilarious but we won't get into that . .

This friend has one in his brush-buggy . . .

It quit working last week while we were out . .
I imediately proclaimed &quot;oh my god, we're lost!&quot;
which is very funny to me . .

Bud then goes into long and concerned lecture on how 
we're not &quot;too&quot; lost . . which had me even more hysterical.

I finally explained to him that I don't get lost . .
Second Lieutenants get lost . .
Been confused for a couple days but not lost . . :-)

These GPS's tho . . you can set it at camp, like push a 
button . . that's base-point . .

Now you go out chasing foxes and other random events,
stop at one point and say you want to come back here
again . . poke the GPS and it sets this as a POI  . .
Point of interest . . I'm making up these words so don't
start using them as grail at the bar . . :-)

So you finally run out of foxes, events or day-light. . .
Haven't got a clue where camp is . .
You are not lost babe, camp is lost . . :-)

The GPS has this piped . . just poke another button and
it shows you shortest way back to camp, base-point you set
before leaving . .

You can set this up at home and it will plot your course
all day . . which is how the gold-miners use it . .

Come home, pipe it to the 'puter and lay it all out on 
a local grid map . . or it will give the coordinates in
latitude and longitude so you can mark on map by hand.

For a prospector, this is hog-heaven . . locating on the
map accurately every pot-hole you pulled color out of is
a PIA . . and you don't even have to keep track of where
you are . . :-) 

I can think of a time in the desert when one of these 
that could tell you the quickest route to &quot;Louies Bar &amp; Grill&quot;
would have been real useful . . :-)

You know how us guys hate to ask directions ?   :-)
I get lost in strange towns on their inner-city transit . .

Picture you're from &quot;No-nothin', Mississippi, first time
in New York City and you want to go for a walk . .

This will get you back to the hotel . . unless somebody
mugs you . . :-)

In which case the bad guy now knows the shortest route
to your hotel . . this I do not think is a good thing . :-)

This is the closest you will probably ever come to being
lost . . it won't last . . a cop will be along to arrest
you for loitering . . :-)

Bud payed about $80 for this marvel of technology . .
I find it strange that it would even operate strapped to
the dash as it was . . as for why it quit . . probably
vibration . . it's an outfit in Washington State so it won't
take long to get it fixed . .

For $80, I'm impressed, and I do quite well with a map and
compass . . . a few memory cells . . :-)

For $150 there seem to be a number of decent names . .
Could be worth it under the right circumstances . .

One problem with Bud's  . . batteries . . seems these things
will burn up a set of batteries in less than 24 hours . .
four AAA's . .

In his case, it's plugged into the cigarette lighter . .

It's good that it quits once in a while . . might blunt
your survival instincts . . :-)

Murphy got a Stealth Fighter . . totally foo-proof . . .
