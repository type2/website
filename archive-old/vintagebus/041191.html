Does anyone have any experience with fixing their own flats while
travelling? I've heard about &quot;plug guns&quot; (Inuvik trip reports - thanks
for telling me about them) but I have never seen one. In India they
still use inner tubes in the tires, and that makes them simple, but
not easy, to fix.
