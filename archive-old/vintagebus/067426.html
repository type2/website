&lt;&lt; Hello everybody,
 
 Could someone tell me how to remove a semaphore from a 1952 barndoor when 
this
 one doesn't work anymore?
 I have the old type of semaphores, is it possible to fit a newer one in my
 bus?
 &gt;&gt;
 p E7 - 5 from 1953/54 workshop manual.   (for buses through 54)

I recommend buying the Bentley reprint for the 50-62 bus which includes this 
manual as well as the 55 edition and the 59 edition... you get three in one!

1.  raise indicator arm to horizonatal position
 (you can do this by gently pulling out the arm at the bottom.  this 
shouldn't damage anything, but I dunno if yours are rusted all to bejeebus)
2.  release fixing screw in door pillar
3. remove indicator arm form door pillar
4.  disconnect cables

I think you can use the later ones in a 52 bus.

Jeff Slater rebuilds semaphores.  He did the ones for my 53 bus.   don't have 
his contact info offhand though.
