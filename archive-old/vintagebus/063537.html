Subject: Bus and a BUG question

Howdy Y'all,
First of all since this is a BUS list, here's the bus question: I noticed on
my '71 Westy (1600 DP) that inside the gas filler door there is a little
sticker that says &quot;Oktan Min. 91 ROZ&quot; I am assuming that this is german
recommending using gas with a 91 or higher octane rating (A genius, aren't I!)
Anyway here's the question: Would using a lower octane rating (economy 87)
cause a very faint, almost un-noticable pinging when the engine is under load
at higher RPM's (i.e. climbing a hill in 4th gear just before downshifting)? 
I have always thought that the higher octane rating gasoline was just a
money-making scam, but after having used the higher octane gas, It seems to
have erased this previously mentioned &quot;pinging&quot;. Am I mistaken, wishful
thinking, or is this probably true?
Now for the bug owners: Anyone one know if the length of the shift rod
selector shaft (the rod that goes from the bottom of the gear stick back to
the tranny) is the same length for a '66 as it is for later bugs ('72), or is
the '66 a different length?

Peace, John Baker
