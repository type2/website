Well, I can assure you that VW's legal vultures are swarming the So Cal
area as we read/write/speak.  I have it on very good authority that several
outfits have been canvassed by VW employed persons traveling &quot;incognito&quot;.
Often they are calling ahead as a customer, asking if certain items are in
stock, what kind of logos are on them, the source of the products in
question, if they are in stock, etc.  They come in a day or so after to see
the goods, leave, then show up again with &quot;cease and desist&quot; paperwork.
Unreliable reports elsewhere (hearsay) have implicated they will show up
with federal authorities with court documents to confiscate inventories
(for either evidence or destruction or both, who knows?).  Again I say this
last sentence is unsubstantiated.

As an example, Sean at Vintage Parts (Glendale, CA) was called by someone
who had been hit (so to speak) and warned him ahead of time that may be
coming his way.  So any repro parts with logos (mudflaps, horn buttons,
etc.,) have been removed from display throughout the store (maybe even from
the premises, he did not say).  Items that are Genuine VW is still on
display AFAIK, I guess if it can be proved they are.

SoCal Imports is no longer manufacturing/selling the license plate frames
with the VW logo/Mr Bubblehead along with the year on the frame.  Y'know,
the Vintage VW Year Frames, right?  The bigwigs there would only hint as to
why.  Get 'em while you can, they are no more.  WCM's been dumping them at
blow-out prices for the past month to their wholesale accounts REAL cheep.

For the past month, Mid America (The Real Source) has been faxing each and
every one of their suppliers/manufacturers requesting copies of licensing
from Volkswagen regarding anything being made/supplied with logos.  The
letter goes on to say that if such proof cannot be provided the
supplier/manufacturer is requested that all products in Mid America's
inventory be returned for immediate credit.

No Quarter's comments regarding &quot;going after the jugular&quot; is apropos.

I guess since VW has become a little smug in their success with their new
models and are proceeding to step on their d**ks again like they did back
in 1986 when I had a run-in about OVH.  A little crazy, their legal
vultures said it was OK as a product line, but not as a business name,
hence the Sherwood Auto since then.  It was a fine line after that, but I
didn't get bugged (pun intended) after that.  They'll prolly get around to
trying to close the site, but that's the least of my problems right now.

They only have their reputation to suffer and it will as we are all seeing.
