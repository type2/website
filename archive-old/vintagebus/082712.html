&gt;Yes, at least in AZ and CA, almost _all_ mild vw street motors, no matter
&gt;what they consist of, can be smogged.  Even the 110hp 2376 torque monster
&gt;Dean Lowry motor topped with Weber 40's in Dr. Mac's old ghia that I get
&gt;to humble the beemer crowd with at an occasional Solo II race.

Another data point in this direction... My friend Jim drove a restored
'65 Must_at_ng in Michigan, which has smog tests.  It had a V8 and a
2-barrel; not sure if it was a 289 or 302.  Anyway, on a two-year-old
tune-up, it passed the smog test for a _1986_ model year car.  On a
fresh tune-up, it would pass the 1989 tests (and probably later, as
this data was from 1990).

Disclaimer: I have never had to take a car through smog.  I think the
California way (mandating stock equipment) is dumb; it should simply
be based on a sniffer, possibly under load, and if you're under the
readings, you're good.  However, Congressmen are too expensive for
most of us, so sub-optimal smog legislation will probably continue.
