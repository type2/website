June 4-5, 1999

If there is only one universal truth in this plane of reality, it is that
even if the KC folks held the &quot;Bug Blitz&quot; in the middle of January, it would
STILL be 105 degrees outside...  Celsius, Fahrenheit, doesn't matter - HOT.

It's been quite a while since I've attended a Bug Blitz.  I used to go every
year, even back when it was at that community college campus out there.. the
one I filled a dumpster with late-model bug parts that didn't sell at the
swap.  It was even this show where I traded the &quot;black death&quot; 84 Scirocco I
had to Jon Christensesn for the best VW I've ever owned in my life - a
Sahara Beige '67 Beetle.  Then, because year after year it was hot enough at
the show to smelt iron, they moved it from mid-July to the beginning of
June, which conflicted with the greatest bus camp-out on Earth - Busses on
the Blue Ridge.  So, needless to say, I haven't been there in a while, not
till this year when Neil decided to cancel BOTBR.  And hey, I ain't got
nothin' better to do.. let's go to KC!

So the deal is, the show is at Argosy Casino now.  We are supposed to camp
at a campground nearby, but Punk informs us that the grounds are flooded.
The casino stepped up and offered to lets us all crash on the parking lot
for the night.. they're even feeding us Friday!  Woohoo!!  A bus trip AND
free Casino food!  Things are looking up!

Come Friday, it's just me, Curt and Shannon heading out together, and it's
REALLY hot....  No time is wasted getting on the road.  We head out 70 by
about 4PM. At our 1st rest stop, Shannon points out that my rear tires (the
ones that used to be on  the FRONT of my old Deluxe) are so worn on the
outer edges that the belts are exposed!  Zoiks!  So, lucky me, I get to
spend the rest of the trip obsessing over my rear tires.   After a rather
uneventful (except for Shannon's non-functioning brake lights) drive, we
finally are within site of the Casino.  For a few miles up to it, I'd been
hearing a strange 'whumping' noise bouncing off the guard rails back to my
ever vigilant ear...   what's up with the bus eh?  So, as we make our exit,
I notice the bus is REALLY hard to steer.. al tight and 'lumpy'.  Did I blow
a font tire?   I jump on the CB, and ask Curt for a visual confirmation.
Curt radios back that all my tires are holding air...  what up wit dat?

As we pull in to the casino parking lot, we are greeted right away by Pink,
and I jump out for a closer inspection of my tires....  The rear ones are
OK.. I go up front, they look OK.. my new Trail-Handler is fine.  I go to
the other front tire (the best out of the 3 old ones I'm still running), and
have a look.  It looks fine, until I run my hand around it and get poked
with a few dozen stainless steel wires... OUCH!!!.  There is a GIGANTIC hunk
of tread separating from the tire! And here I was all worried about my rear
tires!  Well, not wanting to deal with it now, we set of in search of food.

Pink tells us that the casino had its fares spread out over 2 hours ago, and
now it's all gone!  What a gyp! Lesson one for the weekend: Never trust s a
Vanagon driver who tells you he's got free eats lined up.   So, we go and
check out the casino, but find only a Blues Bar with totally obnoxiously
loud music blasting from it, and a buffet with a mile-long line that ain't
moving.  We decide to go back and ask Pink what the local eateries have to
offer.  Pink leads us to some country-style restaurant, where they have lots
of kewl vintage stuff all around -including a very old Harley- and we order
up a feast.  I had chicken-fried something, and Curt had chicken-fried bits
of stuff, and a side order of corn with a pubic hair in it (free of charge),
Shannon had something else that was chicken-fried, and they also gave us big
rolls, potatoes, salads, macaroni and cheese in the shape of a bowl, and we
washed it all down with chicken-fried Coke.  Mmmmmm,mmmmm good!!!

Back at the casino parking lot (after Curt got us lost), we set about
selecting spots that would ensure that stinger-equipped trailer-queen
baja-bugs wouldn't make us move at 3AM.  We grabbed us one of those little
grassy-islands out in parking lots ya know... with the light posts in them?
Surrounded it with our busses, and lounged out for the evening.   Finally
about 2AM we were wound down enough to attempt sleep, but it was still
pretty hard with the parking-lot cheesy 80's rock music blasting at me.  KC
must be big on parking lot music... everywhere we went, there was some sort
of mu-sak playing over loudspeakers. Anyway, another problem was that I
still don't have any sort of bungee to hold my curtains up against the side
of the bus, so they hang back away from the windows a bit... and the gaps of
course line up perfectly with the flood-lights and my eyeballs... no matter
how I positioned myself in side.  I tossed and turned for a while, and got
myself yet another one of those headaches...  and just hung out by myself
for a while.   About 3-3:30 or so, someone pulled in in a late Westy, and
started setting up all these little red cones around his bus. What a goof I
though!  Well, as it would turn out, that goof was Pete Sottnik from Broken
Arrow, OK.  ;-) If I knew it was him, I'da gone over and shot the shit for a
while!

The next morning, I awoke to the stench of Curtis's coffee pot, and the
sound of a few stingered bugs pulling in.  I dragged myself outta bed, and
set off to the swap area.  It was a bit cloudy and cool in the morning, but
that would all change soon enough.  I was yet again unsuccessful in locating
a Sahara Beige radio block-off plate, and bus bumper guards, and a SO-33
table.  Well, I'm done, so I set back to the bus for a bit (but not before
running into Pete).   Back at the bus, Curt and I set up the Missouri Micros
banner, and I flew the colors of Der Fatherland.  Not long after that,
Glenn, Mike and Will showed up, and we had us a good ol time making fun of
my Trail-Handler, and watching me swap tires out.  It got REALLY hot, and I
consumed an astonishing amount of that Lipton Brisk iced-tea stuff.  I had
brought along my new but old-looking Murray, and we all took turns riding
around the show on it.  Inspiration struck me, and I bunge-strapped my video
camera to the back of the back, and got motion-picture footage of the show
&gt;from the &quot;Bike-CAM&quot;.  There were more trailer-queens at this show than I
have ever seen in one place. And the worst of it, most were baja-bugs!  Who
the hell makes a trailer-queen BAJA???!!!  Santa-Claus was there with a
Corvair-powered sleigh, and a really butchered late-model bus.  There was a
Binz double-cab parked in the swap area, which was my favorite vehicle
there.  Some schmuck parted out a near perfect condition, nearly totally
complete split-oval bug in the swap, and that made me pissed.  Curt bought a
bunch of hippie stuff in the swap area, but we won't go into that.  The
kewlest score of the day was that Jon Christensen handed me a owners manual
for a 67 beetle, which upon closer inspection later in the day, turned out
to be the ACTUAL ORIGINAL MANUAL to my bug!!  Wow!  Is that freaky or what?

There were some nice bugs and busses there, not a whole lot of stuff,
basically cars I'd seen a dozen times or so already, so the actual show
didn't interest me all that much.  And man, was it ever hot out on that
black-top! About 2 or 3 or so, Curt and I decided it was time to get on the
road, and we started packing up to move out.  We took a cruise through the
show area in our rusty bio-hazards on wheels, and hit the highway... in the
wrong direction... oh wait, it WAS the right direction.. DOH!  Where are we?
Man, the highways in KC SUCK!  The exit we needed to take was closed, we
turned down another road which turned out to not be finished yet!!, and
finally about an hour later we were driving east down I-70.

We had a ferocious cross-wind, and my huge trail tire on one side, and the
dinky spare on the other side sure made my life difficult. The worst part
was the sun.. I had the hatch open on the drive home, and a beam of sunlight
was coming right through it and shining directly onto my right foot, for the
entire drive home.  Man, do sunburnt feet hurt like hell !!! we made it back
in pretty good time, the gas mileage was pretty crappy though, I guess due
to the cross-wind, but still within acceptable limits I guess.

The worst part of the whole trip is now I guess  I'll have to buy all new
tires - an expense I could really do without at this point in my life...
that Trail-Handler wasn't cheap!  But we all agree a full set would look
pretty cool on the ole Turk.. so who knows..

The next day (Sunday) there was a show in St. Louis at Southland VW, but I
skipped it since I slept till about noon, and for a St. Louis show, I KNEW
there would be nothing but crap there anyway (like all those gateway guys
with &quot;Muholland Look&quot; bugs and a more trailer-queen Baja's. )

I spent my time getting the bus rims ready for new tires, and TRYING to find
a tire shop that can balance wide-5 rims.
