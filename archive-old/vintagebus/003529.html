This sounds like a good find. My '65 SC is my first type II in about 20. I would like some help from the list please. Of the following list of parts, what could I use from this find? And what would the esteemed list think would be fair pricing for these parts? 

engine lid
gates
chest door latches
headlights
belly pan
