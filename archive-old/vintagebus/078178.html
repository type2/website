Subject: Re: Adhesives from May 1959

Could be as simple as a double sided masking tape.
I have a pie plate with a piece of masking tape
on it that includes a great aunt's name. She
probably put the tape on there 40 years ago,
and it has survived many pie baking and dish
washing between then and now.

Check with old-school woodworkers, they like
to use the old style adhesives.

Jeff  - just enjoyed a peach pie from that plate

Accordingly, I figured I'd ping the list and see 
if anyone out there could dream up a thought as to
what other type of adhesive they might of used.
