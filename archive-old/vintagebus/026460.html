&gt; Back when I had a '80 Vanagon (aircooled) I
&gt; rigged up a water misting system using a new
&gt; 1 1/2 gallon garden sprayer a length of drip
&gt; tubing and a mist head.  I had the sprayer
&gt; between the front seats, and with a fully pumped
&gt; tank it would spray for just over an hour, the
&gt; length of my commute. I hung the mist head just
&gt; inside the left air intake vent louvers.
&gt;

    Last year a buddy of mine rigged up a 2 gallon ultrasonic vapor
humidifier under the rear seat, had a small 1 1/2&quot;  plastic hose off the
output side thru to just behind the cooling intake screen, then a smaller 1&quot;
hose to the heater booster fan on the Alt.  This is on an '81 Westy.  The
humidifier ran off a 600W inverter ($50-$60 at Advance Auto).  Used this
set-up on his around the US year-long tour (Sept '97- Aug '98).

    Engine ran in the 195-215 degree range even thru the Desert in the summer
and he had almost as much heat as a wasserboxer.

    The way he had it set, it would run for 6-8 hrs between refills.

    Just recently he fabbed up a rabbit radiator fan motor that I had laying
around into a front booster fan for his Van...

    He took a Alt.-mounted booster fan and housing, attached the squirrel
cage fan to the radiator fan motor.  Then he cut the feed tube from the
heater boxes just above the spare tire and pop-rivited the feed tube to the
former alt.-mounted fan housing (sealed with silicone and duct tape).
Secured the whole thing to the body with aluminum angle brackets.  For
switching he modified the fresh air fan switch so now it has 3 fresh air fan
speeds and a heat booster speed...  Gets so darn hot in there now that we
usually turn off the booster within 10-15 minutes on the road.

    If anyone is interested he has also done a water heater that runs off the
exhaust from the Aux. gas heater, a shower system that can be used inside the
Van, and made his own roll-up awning...

    Using all salvage yard VW parts and a little Yankee ingenuity went a long
way...

    Take care...
