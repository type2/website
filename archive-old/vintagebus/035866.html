&gt; Hello all...recently I have experienced the &quot;I don't have time to help you&quot; 
&gt; ordeal.  I have been trying to get new suspension installed on my 67 kombi.  
&gt; Unfortunatly the mechanic I have been patiently waiting for finally told me 
&gt; that he was not going to have time to work on my bus.  So I have been 
&gt; frantically trying to find someone else to help me.  As my luck would have 
&gt; it, the Kelley Park VW show is 2 weeks away and all VW repair shops are 
&gt; booked until May.

SO...what is wrong with your suspension?  Missing, bad steering?  what is the exact problem?  Where are you- seems like somewhere in the bay area?

I started working on my VW when I took it to a shop and they charged me $180 to not fix it.  I felt a bit ripped off.  Besides, now that I have older buses (mine was only 13 years old at the time) there is no way I could pay shop rate to have a nice running bus, cause they seem to have a certain amount of wear and tear and delayed maintenance.  It is my own personal biased opinion that if you don't have a good paying job you need to be able to do some stuff,  even if you do you should be able to do things like change a fan belt and a blown fuse.

  So my only alternative is to do it myself!!  I feel 
&gt; pathetic being 22 years old and having 8 years of VW history under my belt 
&gt; and totally lacking the knowledge of how to fix anything myself, not to 
&gt; mention that I am a girl.  So would somebody...anybody offer me some advice 
&gt; on how to get started and exactly what to do in order to fix my front 
&gt; suspension

Well, I have never been able to figure out what differnce it makes what kind of privates you have to be able to fix a VW.  I can't imagine what use they can be for that, and possibly painful to use them. 

Do you have an idiot book? (by John Muir)  get one if you dont, and sit and read the section on steering (shimmies and shakes)  tells you how to figure out what is wrong with steering, and easy to read and understand for the non mechanic.  Also it is very good to have the Bentley reprint of the 1963 ed Transporter Workshop Manual, excellent and comprehensive info on 63-67 buses (also much applies to earlier ones)   Also, friends are invaluable.   Friends with VWs are usually happy to help, and often have tools you don't have.  Some stuff really is so much easier with more than one person.

Hope this helps.  Do post what is wrong with your suspension.
