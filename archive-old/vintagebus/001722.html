the crane box is available locally here a BAP
for the same price(with your bus club discount)
I ran one in my 240z for over a year without a hitch.
they come with adaptors for all 4,6 and 8cyl engines.
they work real well as long as you keep dust and water
vaper off of the optical sensor.
a magnetic pickup is much more reliable.
just my 2 cents.

&gt; They make them in 6v and 12v so since I got some emails from you guys and
&gt; gals asking about it, here's some info for you.

&gt; Produces up to 50,000 volts on coil (not included)  (My Note: This is a
coil
&gt; assist setup - you still need a stock or Bosch coil.)

&gt; Assures easier starts, better mileage, smoother operation.
