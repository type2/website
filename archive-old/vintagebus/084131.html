Subject: Tachometer Install?

I got this nice VDO tach off of e&amp;%y and went to install it and it looked pretty simple. The directions were really strait forward. Got everything hooked up and cranked the bus up, tach not working. Tach was hooked to coil negative terminal. Turned on the headlights and got allot of white smoke, shut it down. Looked under the dash and the wire for illume power was fried. It was hooked to the same terminal on the headlight switch that the dash lights are as directions stated. Now the rheostat in the headlight switch is loose feeling and touchy in the sense that if you jiggle it the lights flicker, but it still works. Wondering what the deal is, any input?
