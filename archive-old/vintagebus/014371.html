In my 66 Deluxe bus I just got, there is what looks to be a complete tool 
set inside of a shreded tool pouch. It looks like its made of little strips 
of material, but coming all apart. What tools should be in there and does 
anyone make repro tool pouches ?

I also need some sun visors and on the jail bars for the back hatch, I need 
the piece that goes in the middle of the window and connects to both jail 
bars. I also need a radio and maybe a clock (might have the clock, but I 
have to dig for it)

Thanks,
David
