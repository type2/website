It's either a Bay Window gate or a nice hack.

A Bay Window DC owner once told me it was so you could see the taillights
if the gate was down.  His gate holes did line up with the taillights.

 i used to own a '63 single cab and the rear gate had 2 holes in it so
 that when the gate was dropped, you could still see the tail lights. it
 looked stock, but i've yet to see that type of gate again. did i have
 something ultra rare or just a good hack job?
 any info would be appreciated. i no longer have the pickup, but have
 wondered this for some time now.
 thanks
