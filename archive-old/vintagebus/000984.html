I want an advice here|!!

Im going to get  my splitti this weekend !!

i never towed with a dolly, and for economic reason i will use my Westfalia
1973 to tow it!!  I know you will say ...man your engine is gonna blow up,
man your tranny will blow....  !!

its 210 km from here, but my engine is a big bore 66 mm (1915 cc ) with
weber, and the weather is around 36-40 F those time!!
I also know a split is lighter in weight than a baywindow!!  The splitties
is having all tire inflated and no brake is seized!!
Do you think my tranny could keep up ??  no major hill , almost flat land to
cross!!   i plan to travel at 45-50 mph...

The reason i think its possible, i saw few image from split towing light
camping trailers in the sixties... and it was 1600 cc...then a 2000 cc
should easily handle it!!

no ?
thx

PS i will take pictures!!!
