ps. my elderly Austrian neighbors are selling their 83 Westy. It is in
outstanding condition !! They approched me to see if I was interested.
Believe me its tempting, until I say how much parts are for them suckers.
Maybe if I bought it my wife would actually enjoy camping enough to come
with me.
Two problems though;
1) it's an automatic
2)it's a v---gon.




&gt; Who will be attending this show?I will be there with my 59 single.I just
&gt; picked up my gates and yet to paint to match the truck,something about a
&gt; brush painted vehicle.If any wants to get ahold of me you can call,page,vm
&gt; or text page me to hook up.
