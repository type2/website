All cool buses....are they worth it or not??? who
knows and I don't really care myself...If they get
their price more power to 'em!....I still would not
trade my $1000 safaris for &quot;any&quot; of them!

&gt; I have been busy on the delete key ( keepin up with
&gt; three lists) and
&gt; notice that the stripped SC in sacramento is making
&gt; everyone slaivate
&gt; over the prospect of driving the shell onto their
&gt; current
&gt; drivetrain...the 59 micro of Moe's is making
&gt; everyone scoff at the
&gt; price, and here comes a 64 11 window (whats that a
&gt; kombi or a standard?)
&gt; in the far east, sposed to run good, for $2000....
&gt; 
&gt; I notice however, that the single has no gates or
&gt; doors. :( and what is
&gt; the price? Might still be a few hunnerd, and then a
&gt; front beam, rear
&gt; end, engine, gates and doors,,,,then and only then
&gt; you start where most
&gt; folks start the resto. 
&gt; 
&gt; Moe's bus is a 59.  Now everyone except Thom and
&gt; Mark Lapriore and
&gt; Charlie Hammil think that is kinda early. And he is
&gt; asking $1750, but
&gt; maybe he will take $500 when no one jumps at it for
&gt; the big bucks...
&gt; 
&gt; Personally, I think I would take $2k and fly to
&gt; North Carolina to get
&gt; the 11 window. But then I'm not currently in the
&gt; market....
&gt; 
&gt; No real point, except to maybe discuss all three
&gt; buses at once?
