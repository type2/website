  You have heard about it, some of you might have allready seen it. Be the
first on your block to own it.
  I just got confirmation and I will be recieving 15 (all I could get)
copies for sale. There were 700 copies delivered in this country and they
were all pre ordered from Motorbooks.  They are being shipped to me tomorrow
so I will have them in a couple days, price to be determined upon arrival,
list price is $29.95 and I will be offering them for less then list price.
  If you have pre ordered please call or e-mail to verify, as this was so
long ago I can't find my list.
