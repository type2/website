Subject: safari window parts

With this talk of safari windows i's thought i would put this out
there.  If anyone is in need of replacment latch bases for Original
German Safari windows let me know.  I reproduced these a few years back
out on one piece of steel.  No more breaking or bending with time.  You
can actually crank down the handles to try and keep the water out
without breaking the base.

If anyone is interested, let me know.

Thanks
Matthew
