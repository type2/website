Hey all,

Just wanted to let everyone know my bus is up again!  He was down for about 
3 weeks just trying to work out the brakes.  I wished I had remembered that 
you have to prime a MC!  But on the bright side spacing that cucial step I 
found a hair line crack in the metal brake line that bridges my 2 wheel 
cylinders on the passenger front wheel!  The spindle on the drum just wore 
into it.  Got the duel circuit MC kickin and it stops pretty well.  It was 
pulling both ways at fist but now it only pulls REAL hard to the right when 
my wheels are slightly turned that way.  I've got new flex lines all the way 
around so I think I can adjust it out.  Does anyone with this conversion 
find a drop or 2 here and there of brake fluid on the bottom of the casting 
of the MC?  Might be due to messy filling and bleeding.  Thinks to Eric&amp;Barb 
for the MC conversion tips at the library (Might want to mention priming a 
new MC for the newbies!) and thanks to KEN for the newton bleed!  High 
Country in around the corner!

Eric
