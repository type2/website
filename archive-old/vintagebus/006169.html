Well, I guess I can now officially say &quot;Change the stats&quot; as I acquired a
'54 Single-the-Cab a few weeks ago.

Someone recently accused me of being &quot;secretive&quot; about it so I thought I'd
formally announce it since I added pics to my site today (see below).

It's currently parked in my garage as I broke the crappy non-German exhaust
(woops!) while beating on it.  Parts on the way...  Luckily I have that
other Barndoor to drive, ha-ha.

Go look at pics now or else!
