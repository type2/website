CDI was added in??
what type??

This reinforces my argument

(Re Subject:  Re: [VB] Distributor list? posted concurrently on vintagebus)
Also had a big deal about CDI add-ons
There was a guy who sells them who made a claim of horsepower gain.
IMHO
false...
lower maintenance yes HP increase, doubtful.
I say high maintenance is good.
The more you have your head inside the engine compartment
for routine maintenance, the better.
It gives you an opportunity to discover potential oversights
that could lead to bad things like fires and other safety concerns.
Bond with your bus!
