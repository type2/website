I thought como green only came in '64 standards and '64 deluxes. Am I

April 61 they started como green interior.   I want a 61 model non sunroof
deluxe microbus with the turquoise bluewhite exterior and the comogreen
interior.  available for 4 months.   Never seen one.   I want one.
  Corner windows, little lights, green.  
Just like candles and icing on the cake.

and.............
someone said that H cases suck.   No they dont suck.   They are great when
used, but they do not stand abuse as much as the later alloy used in the A
cases.  B cases are H cases with the bigger oil passages, BTW.   If you
overheat you H case the studs may pull out.   They don't if you don't.   (Or
the DPO).  Yes, an  A case is sturdier.  But Not all have factory installed
case savers, either, just certain ones (is it the AKs).    Yes, I would prefer
an A  case, and that what I have in my 61.       I have driven many a mile in
a H case, and proud.
