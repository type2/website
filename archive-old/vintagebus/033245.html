&lt;&lt; -take both rocker assembly pieces to get acid dipped, and then galvanized. 
 Would the galvanization make it harder to weld them back on?  I'll be using 
a standard 110 lincoln gasless mig, if that means anything.  &gt;&gt;
Hi Mike,
The only problem with this is the zinc when it is heated off turns into a 
vapor which just like burning aluminum can easily kill you due to attacking 
your lungs!  Zinc is the way to go for rust protection but has to be handled 
properly.  We are looking into this right now.  Will be stopping by our 
friendly welding supply shop Tue or Wed to see what they say about 
resperators or perhaps a fresh air hood.  Maybe we can pick up a M-18 gas 
mask and using a long piece of tubing with an adapted and well cleaned 
vaccume cleaner make the latter!      Eric&amp;Barb
