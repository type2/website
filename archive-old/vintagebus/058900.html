Subject: RE: Fw: [VB] vacuum dizzy upgrade problems

There  are some dizzys that when installed will have the number one position
at approx 2 o'clock. Just set it up that way. You do not need to move the
dixxy drive. 

ronnie

ps. there should be a scrib mark in the dizzy at the 2 o'clock position
which would be number 1`

I checked the distributor drive and its &quot;correctly&quot; positioned 
(according to the bently) when the engine is at top dead center- its 
side-to-side and the slot is more toward the rear of the car.  Some 
better questions:

Should the radial mark on the distributor casing (that line) always be 
pointed more toward the back of the bus? (it was on the 009)
Is there more than one type of dizzy clamp- mine has the bolt on the 
right hand side of the dizzy?
Can the rotor position be changed relative to the protruding slot in on 
the bottom of the shaft?

Thanks again,

&gt;&gt;You can pull the distributor drive and turn it 90 degrees to accomodate
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;the
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;vacuum can. Muir suggests a method using a pencil that worked for me.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;Don't
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;just jump into this though, read the manuals carefully and know what you
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;are
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;doing.
&gt;&gt;While I don't and haven't run a dual vacuum dizzy (vacuum advance and
&gt;&gt;retard), I have heard negative things about them. I think they were one of
&gt;&gt;those things VW did for smog control, not performance. Got to make up your
&gt;&gt;own mind on that one.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Chances are higher that the dizzy drive was
&gt;turned to accomodate the 009, and you
&gt;should now put it BACK by following the
&gt;orientation procedure in the Muir.
&gt;You can also run the dual vacuum distributor
&gt;with the retard unplugged.
