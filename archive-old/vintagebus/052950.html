Subject: Re: [VB] hard starting

&gt; I've really been having a tough time starting my bus these days.  I just keep turning it over again, and again and again and again and again and eventually it starts.  I set the points, the timing, etc.. it just takes a long time to get it running?  I drove my bus last winter on occasion and it wasn't near this tough to get started and it was much colder than these last couple of days.  Once it's running and warm it will restart ok but it's that initial started that's a b*tch. I'm running 20-50 oil and I'm thinking about going to 5 - 30 for the winter (not that I'll drive my bus much anyway in the winter).  I wonder if that will help?

Could be flooding. Thats the symptom anyway.
Does it smell gassy? After you shut it off do you smell or see any gas
wetness around the carb.
Seems to ne this ios typical of a leaking cutoff valve in the carb.
Ive seen it caused by a funky vlave itself, deformed washer under the
valve or a leaky, heavy float valve.
Quick and easy to check out.
cheers
