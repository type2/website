Well, my personal children never cried, or at least I have removed those
incidents from my memory.

Best thing we ever did was to buy each daughter a cassette player and
headphones of their own.  They have a box of tapes, and since each has a
player there's no argument about what is to be played.  Daddy is usually
up front listening to that horrible-sounding ham radio anyway.

Good music for children:
&quot;Harmony Ranch&quot; by Riders in the Sky
Disney movie soundtracks
&quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot; by Weird Al Yankovic and Wendy Carlos
Raffi (but not for grownups, after 20 minutes you'll need a diaper change)
Wee Sing (ditto)
Yellow Submarine by the Beatles
Marilyn Manson (just kidding)
