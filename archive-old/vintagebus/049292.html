List:

Sorry for this post, but I need help in making the '59 Westfalia a reality at the OCTO/Classic weekend (Kelly Park is out of the question).  Here's what I need, even willing to pay above reasonable prices:

6 volt Bosch coil - screw on connectors
6 volt Bosch regulator - generator mounted 130 watt
Inlet metal fuel line to the fuel pump - 6mm
Outlet metal fuel line to the carb - 6mm

As always, thanks in advance.

Robert
