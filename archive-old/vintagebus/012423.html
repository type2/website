There are 6 buses in the NEATO Registry with M-Code 372, the
earliest made in 1959 and the latest made in 1963.  The 360/370
(and into the 400s) codes are generally thought to be for North
American usage with several M-Codes grouped for shipment here.
Sealed beam headlights, laminated windshields, bumpers with
overriders and all red taillights are most likely the options
grouped in the 300 group.
