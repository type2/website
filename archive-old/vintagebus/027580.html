Subject: NQ--can't get mail through to you
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

For the rest of the list, sorry.  Mail comes back to me saying &quot;data format 
error.&quot;

NQ--
Anyway, composed a reply offering to send pix, just let me know what doors.  
Bounced right back to me.  Tried to forward the whole mess to the list, that 
bounced back to me.  If I can't send a simple e-mail to your address, I 
certainly can't send any pictures.  Do you have access to another e-mail 
address?  Any other ideas?--David
