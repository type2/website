 I will be putting one in the 64 Single cab &quot;big nut&quot; soon and wanted to get
 the list opinion, I do very little freeway travel, mostly around town, so I
 should go with a stock set up, not a freeway flier, right?
 
 I think my redux boxes are good and have had no problem but was wondering if
 I should go ahead with the turn key tranny, rebuilt tranny with the redux
 boxes attached? &gt;&gt;


Me I would go with the 4.12 for a 1600.  If you have a larger than 1600 motor 
you may want the 3.88,  

If the RG are good, why fix it?  Unless you have much more money than time, 
and you are just happy to pay now.    Or you could figure than if you inspect 
bearings.  3 out of 4 are accessible w/o removing the plug/stub axle.
