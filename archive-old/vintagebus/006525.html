Subject: [VB] No-oil-pressure culprit unmasked...
Message-ID: &lt;006401bf37bc$3de8a7a0$a9650a3f_at_pavilion&gt;

'70 Bus suddenly with no oil pressure upon startup.
Figured it was the oil pressure control valve, pulled it and the oil
pressure relief valve out to clean/inspect things... nada.
???
Then surmised it might have been a tang/slot relationship gone sour between
the oil pump drive gear and the camshaft...
But they were alright.
Hmmm...
So I tried air pressure through the *low* side relief valve outlet of the
gene berg relief-style pump cover... as this apparatus is a kind of check
valve, none should have gone through. We had flow...
A little piece of rubbery stuff had lodged between the ball and the seat...
it looked like the equivalent of casting flash from the o-rings that go
'tween the case halves, one on each of the six big studs...
that's my guess, since i used no sealant or gasketage of that type...
might want to make an addition to the mental trouble-tree... ;)
