&quot;WHO CARES!!!! LIKE TO STIR SH%T UP HUH? THAT AD IS
PROBABLY 20 YEARS OLD!
GET A LIFE!&quot;

...in response to my previous post about an old Gene Berg magazine ad. Well, 
that was not the reaction I expected, but we are all entitled to opinion.

The fact is, the ad is almost 30 years old. It appeared in the October 1970 
issue of Hot VWs magazine which was about the same time that  the Doghouse 
cooler equiped VWs first hit the U.S. shores.

It just goes to show that Berg in fact DID do research throughout the 70's 
and 80's and discovered that VW had designed the most efficient cooling 
system available. The remote cooler kit was abandoned by Berg not long 
after.

In the early days of VW off roading, racers discovered that vibration from 
solidly mounted engines and transaxles would break the mounting tab on the 
early VW cooler. This was one of the reasons why so many people installed 
remote mounted coolers back then. The Doghouse cooler is far less prone to 
breakeage compared to the early one.

I have to agree with the other people on the list that believe in the 
quality of Berg products. He may not have been a snappy dresser, but he knew 
how to manufacture parts the right way.
