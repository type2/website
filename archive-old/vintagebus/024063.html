Hi Darin.  It's quite possible to retrofit an older 66&lt; master
cylander.  Check 'the sermons' for details.  I believe St Muir devoted a
section on this too.  As far as upgrading to a 68, the process should be
similar, you'll just have to be creative, or maybe someone else who has
already upgraded theirs can guide you.  I retrofitted mine until I
gather enough info to upgrade to disc brakes.
