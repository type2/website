Hmmmm.  Remember that statement old timers, I think my dad had a key
chain that said that in the late 60's??  Funny how small minded

&quot;IT&quot; was founded on descent.  Be a sheep and follow the corporate heard
if you want, just don't call me un-American for questioning the

Post to me directly if you want to continue :-)  Freedom ain't it great!!
