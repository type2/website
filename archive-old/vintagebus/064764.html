Hi Tom,
There are such, but if you read the directions you have to remove the 
majority of the rust so you can convert only a thin layer of iron oxide.  The 
problem with this is of course how much to remove and even when treated if 
the area is subjected to scratchs, dings, or chipping the rust blooms once 
again and runs in vein like tunels under the paint. 
  If instead you remove all the rust and high contant zinc primer (Make sure 
it has at least 85% zinc content!!) with a couple of coats of paint and the 
area is later scratched, dinged, or chipped the rust is contained  to only a 
very small area.  The zinc primer acting as an anode will not only contain 
the rust, but slow it to a glacial crawl on the exposed steel and not allow 
the rust to vein under the paint.
