Hi Gary,
Other than being a little hard to clean off there is nothing else we have 
heard of in the way of problems.  It acts as a sound deadener, repels rust, 
acts as a good glue.  For us in the North we not only need it for sound 
deadening (Which a well balanced engine goes a long way toward!), but for 
glueing thermal insulation in with no risk of rust forming between the sheet 
metal, and insulation.    Eric&amp;Barb
