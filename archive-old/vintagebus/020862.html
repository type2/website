Subject: Re: [VB]  Cheap Taiwan/China parts screw me!!!

I've had the same experience a number of times, and I think I finally
solved it.  (Thank goodness - having to toss a perfectly good alternator
because the keyhole is rounded out is expensive.)  

Check your belt tension about 50 -100 miles after you adjust it.  I've
only had that problem on one vehicle.  I've stolen the alternator
assembly from both Horst and Jessel, but only Gretchen throws the key. 
Somewhere in the mismatch of OEM and aftermarket whatevers, Gretchen has
issues with tightening the belt.  I was rounding the keyway about every
thousand miles.  Since I double-checked the belt after tensioning it (and
found it very tight - two shims worth!) I've put on about 4000
troublefree miles.

Does anyone know if the old style pulley (with the two arms from the back
half that go through the slits in the front half) will fit on a modern
alternator set-up?  It seems to me that would hold up better.  VW had to
have had a reason to change it, anyone know?

Wouldn't a splined alternator shaft be a great fix?
