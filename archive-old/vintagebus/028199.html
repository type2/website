OK - So I am frustrated that everytime I fill up, and I don't mean
top-off, my tank leaks out the filler cap when I park. The streets in
Minneapolis are graded pretty steep and it can be kind of embarrassing
not to mention dangerous with a puddle of gas by the rear tire.

The obvious is to stop before the pump does, but I'm wondering if a
different cap might help, or perhaps a different tank, I need to remove
mine eventually to replace the level sender for the guage.

 Any ideas?

Thanks - Tim in Minneapolis
