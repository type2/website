Here is a story of shipping and handeling charges I deal with at work.


This morning I have just recieved in the mail a PCV vavle I requested
removed from a high mileage test vehicle and the bill for the shipping and
handeling was over the top.This is the breakdown on their S&amp;H,$40.00 for
removal from vehicle (5 min job),$40.00 administration fee and a $40.00
shipping fee(the part traveled 10 miles).I thought this was a good example
in light of what has been discussed in the last few days.Yes this is
outrageous but it goes on all day long.
