I've had a few people ask me why I'm even allowing discussions
of the new bus as a non-friday topic.  I felt it was a big deal,
and I knew there'd be a lot of people bursting at the seams to
get their thoughts out on the ether, and it would make for
one pretty crammed Friday.  Once everyone gets it out of their
system, it will become a Friday topic again, and the inevitable
newbies that show up on the list can be referred to the archives.

For a bit of fun, I uploaded pix of some 50's bus clones placed
alongside the NM for comparison:

And Jerry Jess sent in some cool photos of some of the same cars; I
especially like the Deluxe version of the Goliath!
