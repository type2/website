there was a c hoice of colours.  If he looks at he M code tag behind the 
passenger seat, and feeds the data into the vintagebus_dot_com m code decoder, it 
wlll tell what colour it was painted when new.    The colour code is the 6 
digits in the middle on the bottom line of the tag.  My 65 westy also had a 
paint sticker stuck unde rthe m-code tag, that says the colours (Samtgru:n/ 
Blauweiss) and the L codes for the paint mixing. 

Bumpers and wheel were painted Silver white.
