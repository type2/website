&gt;I want to take the whole rear axle of the 70 and put it on the 65.

Go to http://www.creative-engineering_dot_com/ and click on IRS kits. I havn't 
installed this, but it looks like the best way to go to me. There are other 
options out there, but this one just seems to be the way to go. You end up 
using a bug style IRS tranny instead of the baywindow bus one. Sell the bay 
window tranny to someone and you'll make some cash. The drag guys like them 
and the rail guys like them too. You won't need that tranny and the bug IRS 
one should end up being nice for your '65.

You should be able to get the kit from Ronnie at http://www.oldvolks_dot_com . 
Get his number from the website and call him.._dot_definatly the best way to go.

At this point I'm considering this setup for my 23-window.
