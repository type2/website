Subject: Re: Single &amp; Double Cab Tilts~ minutia detail
Cc: &quot;Robert Davis&quot; &lt;RDAVIS_at_cottagehealthsystem_dot_org&gt;

VanBondo was the owner of a 1957 Single cab for six years. The truck had a
complete OEM tilt and canvas. All of the details described by R. Davis are
correct. One additional detail which has not been mentioned is that there
were two small canvas socks which slipped over the ends of the center flat
stock strap support. Each &quot;sock&quot; was made of the exact same canvas from
which the tilt was made, the width of the flat stock and approx. 2.5 inches
in length. This sock was secured to the tilt frame by the screw which
secured the outer most wood slat.
When I got the tilt they were in rough shape so I never put them on the
truck. I will do a cursory recon in my black hole mess of a garage and
forward a scan if if if...

If anyone reproduces this detail it should be remebered that the sock was
turned in side out so that all of the seam edges are on the inside and the
finished edge &lt;hem-like&gt; seam is looks finshed during installation.

Betcha didn't know that!

I recommend that if you have an original canvas that you place a smallish
hunk of duct tape over the screws that hold the end caps and the center
metal strap to the wood bows. Once the canvas is installed, the tape won't
show and it will reduce the chaffing of the canvas on the screws. Old
weathered wood will saw right through old canvas. Don't drive with the OEM
canvas in place! I ruined one &quot;back in the day&quot; by not realizing these
things. Five miles down the freeway turned it into ribbons. =( I still see
it advertized for sale occassionally for higher and higher prices.
