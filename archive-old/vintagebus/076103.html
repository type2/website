Subject: 1960 Double Cab... 6-20-03

Didn't get to work on the double cab until around 7:00 PM today. So I 
went ahead and sprayed the rest of the primer and finished the first 
coat of flat black rattle can paint. It got dark on me but I more or 
less finished what I started yesterday and got one coat with a good 
amount of coverage over the whole bus. It's a good base coat for 
sure, but will definatly need another.

My wife called and said she'd be coming back home tommarrow night 
instead of Sunday night, so that kinda cut down on my work time. I'll 
get up early tommarrow and try to finish up the paint stuff. Then 
spend the next part of the day working on the electrical system 
again. I'd love to have the truck back to where I can start it with 
the key and drive it. That will be a major thing that keeps me from 
getting the wrath.

After my shower tonight I polished up the chrome emblem I grabbed off 
the 23-window. It's in pretty darn good shape. Not perfect though. So 
it won't end up on the Deluxe. Therefore it makes it's way to the 
Truck.

I also took apart the headlights and repainted the parts, polished 
the chrome, changed the bulbs, and put them back together. They look 
incredible!

Having these little chrome parts really shine will make this Rat Bus 
really have character.

What color should I paint the bumpers? Is flat black too much? I 
don't want red. How about white?

Better go to bed. Tommarrows a big day!
