Subject: Splitty lower nose panel repair

I'm in the process of ordering parts for my '63 resto.

I'm having some difficulty finding the correct lower nose panel.
The part I need is this:

http://www.wolfsburgwest_dot_com/cart/DetailsList.cfm?ID=211703073a
Part Number: 211 703 073 A

I need the section thats 2&quot; above that &quot;seam&quot;.
This is the rusted bus's nose:
http://www.gacker_dot_com/bus/pics/small_pdr_0131.jpg

The WW part is flat and needs to be curved. I don't know about that. 
Anyone done it?

Bus depot doesn't have this part and can't get it, CIP1 and others sell 
this same flat
section.


I helped a friend replace this exact same section a few years back and 
he got a hold
of a reproduction panel that was like the above but pre-curved and 
excellent quality. I was
very impressed with how well it fit. I want to say that it was a das 
bulli haus panel...thats where
we used to get most sheet metal panels.... but i don't know where to 
find those anymore.

I also saw that ahschofield.co_dot_uk has what I'm looking for in a few 
different formats.
Does anyone know a reseller of this part here in the U.S.?

thanks
Eddie Goodwin
