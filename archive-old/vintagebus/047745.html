Subject: my '59 panel progress
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hey list---
With the recent popularity of bus updates, I thought I'd share a bit of my 
story with you!

I've had my '59 panel since Oct. '98 and it really got me into the vintage 
thing. So it sat in my garage for a few months while I admired the PO attempt 
at a house on wheels. We are talking hacked corner windows (not the VW, but 
the bubble '70's windows), a hacked bubble window hatch, an air conditioner 
on the roof, a skylight vent, hacked flared wheel wells, hacked late model 
taillights, a smashed rear bumper/apron/corner, newspaper filled rockers and 
the list goes on . . . A big project huh?  Thank god my buddy Neil is a body 
man and he decided to take on the resto as I'm not a body man(You'll prob 
give me some grief but I'm learning!)  Anyway----

With 9 months on and off of metal work and block sanding (and ALOTof working 
for the $), finally the bus is paint ready. So off to the paint shop we went 
last week. I about had a coronary when I found out the price on my PPG 
products. Oh my goodness is Sealing Wax Red expensive(thanks for the PPG code 
lou (vwdragon)!
I left w/ 2 gallons of Sealing Wax Red, 2 gallons of clear, 1 qt of 
silver/white, 2 quarts of grey for interior, 1 qt of black, and all the 
neccessary reducers/hardeners. . . Even the guy at the paint store looked so 
suprised at the total that he cut 15% off of the cost so I wouldn't choke!!:)

So now the time has come to have the fun in the resto------

I'll keep you posted and hopefully get a small pic site up when it's 
complete!!!!

Sorry for venting but I needed it and I like reading about others restos
BTW----Thom? How the hell do you do it ?  You've whipped out 2 before mines 
even painted!:)

Take care everyone---
Pete
