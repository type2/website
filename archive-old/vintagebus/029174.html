&gt; This is a message I attempted to post to the type4um - a website driven type

Erin,
It would take just a minute to register so that you can post there.  It's
painless too.  I happened to register last week and filed a trip report from my
first long distance drive in the type 4 powered '60 DC.

&gt; I've got 3 T4 blocks sitting around here with one complete 914 engine/tranny
&gt; combo.  I'd like to make a powerful and reliable T4 engine to either put in
&gt; my 1967 bus or 74 Super.  Either way, it would be great to take these T4
&gt; cases and put them to use.

Sounds like you have an embarrassment of riches to me.

&gt; I've read a lot of Gene Berg's information on
&gt; the use of the T1 engine and am a firm believer in building engines like
&gt; tanks so you don't have to tear them apart all the time or ride on the edge
&gt; of your seat worrying that something bad might happen. [...]

&gt; .  Further I ask:  How big of a P/C combo can you go with a T4 and still
&gt; maintain reliability for daily

&gt; driving, remove any low miles blowby problems, and still go with some higher
&gt; performance parts for extra power?  It's a long drawn out question I know -
&gt; but I want to build a powerful T4 with reliability in mind.  Thanks for
&gt; reading.

Not sure just how big you want to go, but I can tell you that I am more than
happy with the power that the type IV is providing my DC.  I built it stock 2L,
7.5:1 CR, stock hydraulic cam.  The mods that I did do were to send the heads,
crank and cam to Bob Donalds at Boston Engine.
http://www.bostonengine_dot_com
His work on the heads was fantastic.  I cc'd them when I got them back and I
could not measure any differences between any of them.  When I bolted everything
up, I checked compression with a high price fairly accurate gauge and found no
more that 1.5 lbs difference across cylinders.

Bob enlarged the valves from stock and if I remember right they were in the 914
range for size.

&gt; I've also talked to my brother and he seems to think that the 103mm bore is
&gt; the biggest and most reliable bore to run.

Remember, that these engines sometimes have blowby with the stock bores.  Look
at heads on the ground in the junkyard and you will see what I mean.

&gt; I've checked out the T4 websites but all I see is, &quot;More power with
&gt; reliability, no longer do you need to start out in 1st gear in your bug, get
&gt; a big bore kit, etc. etc.&quot;

Stock engine, and its a piece of cake to pull away in 2nd from a standing
start.  I use 1st to roll and immediately shift to second.  I use 3rd from 20mph
to 55mph (if needed).  4th from 40mph to 75.  I have wound the speedo all the
way around to the zero peg and the GPS registered 86.9 mph.   3rd is real nice
for LA style bumper to bumper traffic.

I would be concerned about going as large as 103mm in a bus due to the load and
heat factors.  Just how much power does one need?  Don't get me wrong, there are
limitations to everything.  I did have to slow down to 55 to cross the grapevine
(0-4000 feet in 8 miles and then up/down for the next 7).

Down sides?
I just blew out the type 1 thing trans that I had put in there.  It had
undergone a stock rebuild before I put it in and it looks like I blew out the
spider gear/rear differential.  (This tran was the emergency one that I put in
there when Todd Hill flaked out on me and I had a week to get it on the road or
loose it to the city)  I don't tear around town and haven't even done or
attempted a single burnout.  That extra torque and the weight of the truck got
me about 2000 miles on the trans.  Pulled out of the parking lot from the
college the other night and clunk.  No warning, no nothing.  Since I only live
1.5 miles away, I was able to limp home.  Was hoping that it was a bad CV, but
crawled under there today to find the CVs ok and chunks of metal attached to the
drain plug.

Any money that you would spend in going larger than 2L, I would redirect into
beefing up your trans.

My  truck will have to sit for a spell while I gather up the bus repair funds.
I'm going to take the opportunity to redesign the intakes &amp; throttle body for
the fuel injection.

Scott
