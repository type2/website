&lt;&lt;Right turn signal will work. I turn on left turn signal and no lights, but
I can hear the relay clicking. Although not as loud. Try the right one again
and it is the same as the left, no light but it is clicking, softer than
before. Wait about five minutes and the right will work again. The front
turn signals are disconnected. I am only worried about the rear ones. The
bus is a 1967 Kombi. Has anyone experienced this before?&gt;&gt;
 
This sounds exactly like the turnsignal problem I had with my Panel. Only
thing wrong was that the taillight bucket was not properly grounding. I
properly grounded the bucket and the indicator light in the speedo light-up
and the left side taillight/blinker started to work. Check to see if all
your connections are clean and you have a good ground wire directly from the
bucket to the chassis.
