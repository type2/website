&gt; i'm installing new intake manifold gaskets on single port heads. what is

Seems like I do it backwards.  My reasoning is that the seam would
possibly cut in to the aluminum head, but not the steel manifold.  Just my
own reasoning, not because it's supposed to be that way.
I use a little bit of silicone sealant on them too.
If VW didn't mention it anywhere, it probably doesn't really matter.
I hope.
