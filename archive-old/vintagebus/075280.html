Subject: Re: [VB] Gas gauge installation

The way things stand with my '67 panel, the gas guage
&gt; on it has been busted.
&gt; It has no glass &amp; the needle is missing as well.
&gt; I'm considering blocking the hole with a flat metal
&gt; plate behind &amp; putty on top, sanding it to contour to
&gt; the dash &amp; then using a VDO or Speco aftermarket unit


Andy-
Would not it be easier (not to mention better looking) to just replace the
stock gauge w/ another stock gauge? 6 volters work fine w/ 12 volts and they
are pretty plentiful. Seems like alot of work to plug a hole when mounting a
guage takes 5 mins. and then the hole plugged properly to boot.
