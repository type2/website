Hey all,

I installed a sony headunit in my 66 dlx about a month ago and have had no 
problems.  Yesterday coming back from the Tocoa, GA show it started cutting 
out.  It only does it had highway speeds in 4th and at the end of the lower 
gears when the engine is reving high.  I figure my generater is producing 
the most amps in that situation, however the engine rpm requires more spark. 
  The headunit power wire is wired into the 2nd to the right fuse on the 
fuse box so it's only on when the bus is.  The memory wire is on the right 
hand always hot fuse.  The ground is screwed to the parcel tray.  Any ideas?

As always thanks,


Eric
66 ugly dlx
