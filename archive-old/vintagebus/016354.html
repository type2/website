Could be a rod.  Could also be a piston losing it.  I had one doing
that that multiple mechanics had told me was a rod that didn't sound
worth the effort to fix yet.  Driving home one day, it turned into a
jack hammer.  When I tore the engine apart, most of the piston skirt
was gone.  The rest of the engine would've been fine if I'd just done
a top-end rebuild on it when the ticking started....
