Subject: ShiftRod bushings???

hello all,
 I picked up a baggie of shift rod bushings and a
coupler for my truck and the baggie has more bushings
than i can shake a shifter at. I recognise the one
that goes on the front with the shift rod guide and I
recognise the small one that goes on the late model 
however i cant figure out where the others go or if I
even need to use them. there are 2 that are cone
shaped, one of those has a wire ring inside it and
there is a bushing that is made of clear rubber rather
than plastic like the rest.
My Bently says nothing about these and I couldnt find
any thing in the library.
Any one have any ideas?
Thanks in advance,
Bryan
