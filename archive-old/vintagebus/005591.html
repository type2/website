Hello fellow listies

after months of friends and other nice people attempting to keep me
connected to the list after I had been removed I have decided once again to
reply to the list and have joined again.

I did know that when I went into business that my life was to change so much
a couple of years into running a business.  nor did I know that once you run
a small business that your life no longer is personal but now public domain.
But here I am and now here it goes once again for all to talk about for
months to come.

Back in September an major unexpended life change happened.  I moved to
Arizona, got a divorce, had child custody issues that had to be addressed,
in all this new confusion and changes I was very delayed in getting orders
and responses back to people, I apologize to all I have delayed in orders.
Currently I have refunded several orders, with a check in a stamped envelope
for Stephen (I do need a new address as I am aware that you moved from
Seattle?)  there has been a delay in this refund as it was quiet a large on
and the funds originally given to me were used for the materials.  I have
been attempting to get the funds together and have now done so.  All other
old delinquent orders have been refunded or completed, except 2 canopies
that will be sent out by next week.  I apologize once again for this matter
but sometime you have to get your personal life together and business does
fall second.  I do not wish to defraud anyone or delay orders that was not
the plan the plan was to take care of things that were of the most
importance and anyone in a divorce, child custody or major life change
experience I hope can understand.  PLF has always been my business although
my ex-husband was highly involved for the time we were together when we
split I fought to keep the business had I not done so he would have been
owner not ever sewing a thing  for PLF I do believe business would have been
much worse.  In the divorce  I received PLF, the business vehicle-panel with
graphics, and after much negotiation and more joint custody of our son.  My
ex took custody of the camper in question, the furniture and household items
and much of PLF property that has not been turned over to me.  When I took
possession of the Panel I also took the remaining debt of $900.00 due to the
original owner still.  My ex took the Camper and any debt of which it
initialed the &quot;Spice Rack&quot;.  I have to pay remaining debt to the panel the
ex is to pay the remaing to the camper.  Which was a part of the deal we
made with Clara Williams in trade for a SO-44 camper interior.  this is a
legal and binding divorce agreement and debts should be taken with the
responsible party.  Clara I though maybe of all people you might be a little
understanding being you are in Seattle you could see what was going on and
you also had a not so good brake up with Rain and had much confusion then.
I apologize I no longer live in Seattle for the time being and no longer
have control over Steve and cannot get him to respond to you but since you
have not been able to contact him here is his email sonder44_at_ireland_dot_com if
you need his phone please p-mail me.  I have taken full responsibility for
PLF all debts and other, although Steve profited and help use all PLF money
to live on leaving PLF in debt during the end of that relationship. I have
finally cought up paid off all bad debt and as of this next week should be
up to date on all delinquent and overdue orders, I plan to continue on with
PLF and hope that this will be the source of income that helps support my
family allowing me to spend more time with my son not having day cares raise
him, also allowing me to attend all shows and restoring my favorite vehicle
vws.  I apologize I do not fit everyone's perfect business persons profile,
I have had to learn a lot recently -new time management running a 2 person
business with one person, learning web design and lots more, I know a lot of
people talk about me on the list and have issues with me although they have
never interacted, I now people have vented about me with good reason, I only
hope that maybe someone will still give me a change because I dont plan on
going out of business anytime soon and hope that after all of this I may
have started to prove that to you disbeliveers.

I want to send a special thankyou to all of you who responded after my last
email in January there were far to many to reply to but all were greatly
appreciated. I have them all saved.

I hope I have not wasted your time or email space and that maybe I have
cleared the air some I hope.
