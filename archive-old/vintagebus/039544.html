&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I was browsing through the Muir Idiot manual and found that he
&gt; &gt; &gt;eliminated his electromagnetic cut-off jet.  Muir claims that VW sold a
&gt; &gt; &gt;screw in jet to take its place.  Does anyone know what this PN# is or 
&gt;where
&gt; &gt; &gt;to order one?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I wouldnt if i were you.
&gt; &gt; But if you want to it really is easy. A bit too easy. Take the device 
&gt;out.
&gt; &gt; Take a pair of snips and cut the plunger off. Pull it out and cut it 
&gt;off.
&gt; &gt; Thats it. Reinstall.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Where is the logic here? You wouldnt do it the correct way with a part
&gt;designed for just such a purpose but you would advise a kludge as a better
&gt;solution?
&gt;

The logic is that you dont need a special part. Correct way? There is no 
correct way, altering the design of the carb by putting any plug is 
incorrect. I am merely stating how to do it, but I am not endorsing it.

The reason why this way is better is that its free, and accomplishes the 
same goal.

A &quot;jet&quot; is incorrect, there is no jet, just a plug either way.
