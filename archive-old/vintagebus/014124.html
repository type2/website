These damn busses are way too confusing. I got my gasket info from the
wolfsburg west site. It corresponds to what Frankie is saying. Well basically
it only mentions gaskets for the years 59-67, then 68-72. So i imagine earlier
years are either different or they didn't even have them.

I don't know about the gasket between the splash pan and the bracket, but on
my '65 it is just a square piece of rubber(actually it has tiny grooves cut in
it, but i aimagine a plain old piece of rubber should work fine)

Am i right or wrong?
There are also gaskets that go between the splash pan and the bumper bracket 
on my 57.
Do they have these too?
