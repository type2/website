Check your local yellow pages for rubber
(and not the ones found in drug stores!)
There are glues, super and otherwise made
specifically for rubber. Find a commercial
rubber supply company. They are also the
folks who supply the fire department with
hoses and gear also.

I had a turntable belt made from o ring rubber
that came in a large roll, cut to length and
glued together. Woulda worked if the rubber
diameter had been metric as the original.

&gt;these seals are sold as circles-   extruded rubber glued at ends
&gt;into a circle.

I wonder what they use to glue the ends together.  If it's something
that mortals can obtain, maybe it would help to separate it at the
joint and install it on the glass to see if the ends overlap.  If
they do, cut maybe half the overlap off of one end and glue it back
together, making the seal smaller.  Just thinking out loud.
