Subject: Re: gas heater install plus...

&gt; The knob for the gas heater has a tiny set screw in it. I believe the
&gt; threads are stripped the know(not the screw). So I was planning on
&gt; filling the hole, then re-drilling and tapping. Any suggestions on what
&gt; to fill it with? JB Weld putty.?

Is there a metal insert in the knob that has the threads for the screw,
or are there just threads in the plastic?  If it has a metal insert and
it's thick enough, you might be able to drill it oversize, tap it, and
use a slightly bigger set screw.  Or maybe they make really really tiny
Helicoils.  :)

If it's just plastic, you could try drilling that oversize as well, but
depending on how the knob was molded, this might be less successful.

As far as filling it up, JB Weld is probably a good choice.  You might
try cleaning out the hole with at least a blast of air and maybe some
alcohol before applying the JB Weld, so it can adhere well.  Normally
I'd suggest brake cleaner for this application, but it might tend to eat
the plastic knob and the alcohol is much less likely to do that.

If you want more time to ponder, Radio Shock sells set-screw knobs that
fit on 1/8&quot; and 1/4&quot; diameter shafts.  If one of these fits, you could
use it for a while while you fix the OG knob.
