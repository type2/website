Subject: Steering column switches

So now that I know that that little broken switch on the steering
column in my 66 is supposed to control the cab lights, where is a good
source for small parts such as this? Or is this one of the &quot;holy
grail&quot; parts that I should keep an eye out for? 

Just when I was starting to get the knack at finding parts from my bay
I buy a split :)
