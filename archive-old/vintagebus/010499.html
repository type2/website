&gt; hey,
&gt; i was watching my speed and rpm last night and this morning 
&gt; and heres what i 
&gt; cam up with. all are 4th gear:
&gt; 40mph  3000rpm
&gt; 50mph  3750
&gt; 55mph  4000
&gt; 60mph  4500

Wow I thought I was being conservative by never running my small nut '60 d
cab with its spendy motor at more than 55mph. I will have to rethink or
accept a rebuild sooner than I like.

Later
