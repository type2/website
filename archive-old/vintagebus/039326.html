My wife just told me she saw a Bus in my neighborhood (Benicia, CA) last 
night around 9:30 or so.  To paraphrase her words:  looked like it had just 
been done up with all the bells and whistles, red or a variation thereof, 
also says it had some kind of top (Camper ?), and she seems to think there 
was a roof rack.  Anybody know anything about this one?
