Yeah I've been meaning to tell you you needed to ad a coffee exhaust can to the stock exhaust on
the panel.  That would be soooo phat man.  To really complete the look though you need to put a
sav- a -spare tire on one corner, cuz ya bent one of your 600 buck a piece rims the first time you
hit a freeway expansion joint.  That, and you need to ding the front end really good cuz ya hopped
up the motor and forgot all about the brakes.   The first time you raced some other skin headed zit
popping teeny bopper and came to a corner you realized you ain't going to stop in time.

You'd really be in the &quot;in&quot; crowd then baby.  ;-) !

&gt; current standards, stands out like Kate Moss at the Playboy mansion...
