More often than not..endplay is first measured with the motor completely
intact.
Then removal of the flywheel/gland nut/etc. and THEN use a good micromete
to measure the ACTUAL thicknesses of the three shims that were in place.
Using the original measurement..the measured total/individual thicknesse
of your old shims...then find out which shims are available for
replacement...do some math to see what can be replaced which will put you
in the recommended ballpark for specs.
Put it back together and measure for endplay again.  Be sure to use the
correct torque specs!
It isn't unusual to have to go thru this procedure more than once.  
Or is it just me?

&gt; &lt;&lt; I just measured the end play on my 1600 DP.  It measures .7 mm.  How
&gt; That is without any shims, correct?  If so then you need three shims adding 
&gt; up to a total of .023&quot; or .024&quot;.   You should try some of your local tool 
&gt; stores for a metric/english conversion chart!  Eric&amp;Barb
