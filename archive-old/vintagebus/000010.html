The Split Bus Club will be camping at MacKerricher State Park in Fort Bragg, 
Northern California on Friday, November 5th thru Sunday, November 7th. All 
bus enthusiasts are welcome to join us. We'll be having a &quot;Peddle to the Pub&quot; 
on Saturday to sample the beverages at the North Coast Brewery,  a raffle 
will also be held. The park has 140 campsites and can hold 3 vehicles per 
site so there will be plenty of room. Reservations are not taken during 
November so plan on getting there early to get the best spots. 
If you have questions you can call Jethro at (916)-971-0677 or e-mail me. 
Come for the day if you can't spend the night!
