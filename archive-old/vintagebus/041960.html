I used outdoor carpeting (the green felt stuff) to cover the springs and
frame, attached with hog rings.  Then I used 1/2 inch stiff foam on top of
that and trimmed the edges to give the seat the proper contour.  Worked
great!

ON a previous project I used 1&quot; foam, but it was too thick, which for a
tall guy in a bus makes a difference!  I ended up having to duck my head
to look out of the side windows!

&gt; I didn't have much luck with the WW horse hair.  On the '55, I used
&gt; a layer of denim glued to the springs, then a layer of this brillo-pad
&gt; like stuff, about 3/4&quot; thick, on top of that, then 1&quot; (I think) 
&gt; upholstery foam on top of that.  They came out sweet!  When I did the
&gt; 60, they were out of the brillo stuff, so they sold me this felt padding
&gt; instead, which I think works even better. 
&gt; 
&gt; It took me about 30 - 45 minutes per seat half, which doesn't include
&gt; prep work like removing the old stuff or painting the frames.

&gt; &gt; this may be a chickensh*t answer.  i reupholstered the seats in my '67 beetle.  i got burlap sacking stuff, wolfsburg west horsehair pads and tmi seat covers.  i took the seats down to their components - back separated from seat.  i spent a weekend on the project - prolly 10 to 15 hours.  it was a pain in the ass.  my hands were sore and raw from about a week afterward.  having a day job as a librarian does not lend itself to work of this nature.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; two weeks ago i took the seat from my single cab to a local upholstery shop.  for $180 i received a reupholstered seat that is, in my opinion, a work of art.  the professional used the original as a pattern and material that very closely approximates what had been on the seat.  for the older vehicles, he seems to take a &quot;restoration&quot; approach.
