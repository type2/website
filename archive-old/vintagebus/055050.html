Subject: Re: [VB] Thread pitch of redux box bolts.




&gt; Bad day in progress....I guess I was due for one. Crosss threaded a redux
&gt; box bolt hole. Need to confirm that it is a M12 1.5 25mm deep. I figure it's
&gt; that or 1.25, need to confirm to order the chase and bottoming taps.

Match it up to a spark plug and a wheel bolt.
Spark plug is 1.25.
Wheel bolt is 1.5.
[diameter doesn't matter, the amount of threads per mm is a constant]
