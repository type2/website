Importance: Normal

I'll be out of the country this Thursday thru Tuesday (10th-15th).  Of
course it will be business as usual at the Depot while I'm gone.  However if
the shop gets unusually busy, it may take a few extra rings before you get
an answer, so please be a little patient, or try again half an hour later if
you can't get through.

Email to sales_at_busdepot_dot_com will continue to be answered by Jerry De Baun in
my absence.  However, I will not be checking e-mail sent to my personal
accounts, busdepot_at_email_dot_com and ron_at_netcarrier_dot_com, between this Thursday
and next Tuesday.

I will be in daily contact with the shop just in case of any emergencies,
but I'm confident that the folks here will do just fine (if not better :-)
without me.
