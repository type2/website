I too am using all the lanes I pay taxes on (because of a sloppy steering
box). Mine is leaking so much that it looks like it has puked oil onto the
horn wire and now I have a horn that works full time. For sanity reasons, it
is unplugged till I find out why. (just bought the bus, in &quot;discovery
 mode&quot;).

Sending out for the great rebuild???? Thought aftermarket rebuilt was only
answer. Do you propose local rebuild?
