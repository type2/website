My 66 Kombi has the ID number 226161705 on the title and on the overhead fan,
yet all the numbers I've seen printed for 66 busses start with 216. Am I
getting my numbers mixed up? 
 - -- -  -- 
the lists list them as 216 xxx xxx etc.   The first three digits are type-
model-year (as in 2-type 2; 1 for panel, 2 for standard micro, 3 for kombi
etc;  and the third for last dgit of the year 6-for 1966.   The 9 digit system
was introduced I believe for the 65 model year.    Look at the last 6 digits
in the list for you serial number.
