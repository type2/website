Has anyone on the list attended this show before?  It's gonna be held near 
Atlanta, GA on June 25 and I was considering making a road trip out to it but 
have never heard of it before.  Is it a big event?  Is it the next big thing 
after Everybus (which I am sorely missing)?  I'd hate to get all fired up and 
drive all day for a handful of beetles.  Somehow I believe it's going to be 
huge (c'mon, it's Atlanta!) and hope to do some mountain traveling before and 
after the event.  Maybe hook-up with some fellow bussers and cruise a little. 
 There are some really nice campgrounds near Atlanta and the Southern Smokies 
are so pretty compared to flat scrub Florida.  If anyone plans to attend this 
event (which I found on the SEVWC_dot_com Website) please post and maybe some of 
us can hook up before or after the show and hang out.
If any Florida or South Georgia listees plan to attend maybe we can cruise in 
together?
Just a thought.
