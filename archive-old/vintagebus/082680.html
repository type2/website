&gt;[jets for dual Kadrons] What motorcycle jets were they?

Archive and library http://www.type2_dot_com/library/fuel/jetss.htm says
Mikuni - try a Japanese bike place.  Ronnie at Old Volks said he stocked
Solex jets, but that was a few years ago.

&gt;I know that when I pull the carbs and take out the jets they will have a
&gt;number on them, what is the correct number for my 1914cc dual kadrons
&gt;78.4x88 with a mild cam? I have no reduction boxes and I have a 412 ring
&gt;and pinion trans from a 68(?) bug.

I don't know the answer to this.  I would suggest reading
http://www.type2_dot_com/library/fuel/jettype.htm and looking at page 22 of
the '73 Without Guesswork at http://failsure_dot_net/oacdp/ for the late
Bus engines.  The numbers there are for a 1700 but they will be in the
direction of what you need.  Maybe multiply the stock jet sizes by
1914/1700 and see what you get?  You might also look at the Solex manual
on that site for more advice.
