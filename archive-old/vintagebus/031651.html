Why is everyone seem to be so anti-Kustom. Go buy a 32 F_at_rd for 5 g's
(stock) or buy a 32 Roadster for 50 g's. Customs are cool to those that like
them and are valuable to those people who build them and sell/buy them. John
did excellent work if he painted and finished it should be worth 20 g's or
more. 
  Why is your Honda lowered with fancy wheels or your 35 g SUVA with custom
tires, lcd TV etc. etc.. I guess Scott Frazier's Type 4 Double cab would
fall into the Custom category, my 58 BD/Binz copy is a Kustom, Howards
chopped single cab, Kyles Limo and the countless other Kustom type 2's out
there. I love stock, but I also like Kustoms (just an extension of the bus
owners personality), Value, who set's that? Type 2 for 45 g's or a driver
for 2 g's. 
If John finished this bus, got it on the cover of Hot VW's, won a couple
shows, then sold it for 40 g's, bye bye stock resto's and break out the
Kustom's. This happened back to the Porsche 356's back 15/20 years ago, I
was an original member of the 356 outlaws, how dare we customize a 356, now
it a whole big deal with people paying more for an OUTLAW 356 then a stock
one.

Ronnie  do it YOUR WAY

Amen brother Jim! While I appreciate the fact that this bus was apparently
cobbled together from a bunch of buses that would normally have seen the
crusher I still couldn't see it being worth more than a couple grand as a
novelty. I'm sure the work is fine, I'm not criticizing what I haven't seen
in person, but we all know that to get what you want out of a bus in this
price range (i.e. as an investment) you have to be either bone-stock, or
front cover material. Otherwise, you've thrown a lot of money into a hole.
It's might be a hole that's a labour of love, but if so, then why sell?
Sure, sometimes you have to scrape the money together, but as the saying
goes &quot;an emergency on your part doesn't constitute one on mine&quot;. I hate to
see people get into the position where they HAVE to sell a bus, but if you
think you're going to ever be there, you can't expect to get crazy prices
on something. The Campulance was a different beat altogether. I can't
believe it stayed in Jim's driveway long enough for the ink to dry on the
For Sale sign!

I sincerely wish the guy selling the bus good luck. But, if it were at a
show...I'd keep on walking by it personally.

But, what do I know...none of my buses are bone stock.
