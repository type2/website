The timing of these magazine threads is amazing!

No, I'm not trying to instigate a heated debate - but
I woke up this morning thinking about the magazines because I am
planning my rust-o-ration of my deluxe and am gathering my info now...
I have successfully used articles and ads to assist me in previous projects
and
was thinking about asking the group for input.. and you had started
already!!! Thanks!

In the past I really enjoyed VWTrends for the simple reason that they had
more
articles on our aircooled busses than HotVWs... which tended to showcase
bikinis.
VW Custom &amp; Classic also ran some great how-to articles that were helpful...
But I'm aware that the 'new trend' may be for the water-cooled, it's just
not going to help me
out too much. Even if I do buy a new beetle (doubtful since I think I'd
prefer a '60s era) I
wouldn't be reading about them in rags anyway - I'm just not into custom NEW
cars
-not very exciting - but that's me.

So, which magazines do you think best showcase the vintage bus -even if only
the sano?
Was it VW Custom &amp; Classic that just resurfaced from 'retirement' or was it
another one?
I think even the clubs ought to be included here - VVWCA's home-grown
publication is fun but rarely delves into busses.

Feel free to p-mail me with your thoughts...
Any suggestions for shops for body work/ restoration located in CA also
apprecated-
I am much better at the mechanical than the cosmetic.

have a good weekend!
