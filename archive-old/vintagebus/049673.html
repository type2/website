&gt;&gt;SOME ONE IN SACRAMENTO AREA
&gt;&gt;PLLEEEEEEEEEEEEEZZZZZZZEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE  get this - even if you
&gt;&gt;don't want it - and I will figure out a way to have it shipped to me!!!!
&gt;&gt;The favor WILL BE REWARDED!

OK - Rex R and I agree - this is TOOO nice a piece to go to the junkers!
SOMEONE has to take this, whether or not you store it for me until I can
find a trucker, take it to a swap, whatever; you Californicators have NO
idea how hard it is to find clean metal on a bus that IS OTHERWISE
unsalvagable. Our local VW yard CRUSHED every NONcamper bus (pickups,
highroofs, a rumoured barn) a few years back' San Antonio ships everything
they find down to Mexico. The few p/us I see for sale here are too nice to
hack up like this.

Even if I can't find a sane, affordable way to get this to Texas, it is of
use to SOMEONE besides the scrap man...............
