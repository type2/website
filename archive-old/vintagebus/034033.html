I just bought Type 2 micro deluxe.
I believe it is 1967 model, but not for sure.
It is cover with the rust entire body and I found small plate which
shown some numbers.
Due to the rust I could only read &quot;Typ 24&quot; and the number 246174383.
I am not sure if it is a chassis no or not.
If not where can I find chassis no?
Could  some one help me to find out how old is my Type2?
 -- - --- - 
the type 24 means a deluxe, the 3rd digit in the chassis number, 246 xxx xxx, 
is the year of manufacture, so yours is a 66 model.

If you look behind the passenger front seat for a 2&quot; by 3&quot; tag, and post the 
info on it, those codes say more about your bus.. exact date of manufacture, 
optional extras, original colours
