&lt;&lt; so...what's easiest if you have to start from (almost) scratch. 
 i have to put an engine in my bus, if everything has been converted (i 
 haven't checked) it will be easier for me to leave it that way, yes? 
  &gt;&gt;
my 61 and 65 are both 12V .  they were 12V when I got them.  

It's easiest to go with whatever is there already.      But the 63 rattruck 
is going 6V (it's 12V now)  to be cheaper as I have more spare 6V parts.   so 
it's easier on the pocketbook  well, it doesn't have a motor or battery 
either, so the only difference is changing the light bulbs and  checking 
blinker boxes.  

if it has been converted to 12V, definately check the dome light bulbs.  If 
they are still 6V 5W, or if they are 12V10W, they'll melt the covers.  Your 
need 5W of the right Voltage for them.  

yes, at that point you can say  do I want lots of 12V accessories?  Do I want 
to use a 6V sapphire radio.... do I have more 6V or 12V parts ...  etc....
