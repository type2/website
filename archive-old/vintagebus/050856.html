Subject: Re: [VB] iceRe: [VB] Carb and manifold take-outing

ya- never got the thermostatic thing on an air cleaner figured out, though I 
think it is a nice idea.  the way i understand it, when the thermostat is 
closed, the air cleaner pulls air ONLY from the pre heat system.   This is 
only on aircleaners with he 2&quot; diameter preheat tube (68 and late).  2&quot; 
diameter in cross section is 4 times that of the 1&quot;  dia. tube.  think it 
would not be good (air starvation) to have  this set up on a air cleaner with 
a 1&quot; pre heat.  anyway, if it is sucking in the warm air (do you have the 
pick up pipe, think that helps, but should work anyway) it should de ice the 
carb.  I'd try staring it up, watching it, and when it starts icing let it 
run at about 2K rpms and watch the system.   does the air cleaner etc start 
warming up?   you may need to get the accessary firewood chunk to lean on the 
gas pedal.   It does de ice faster/better above a normal idle speed.

The thermostat theoretically keeps the flaps nearly all the way closed when 
the therm is closed, and the engine warms up faster (&amp; more completely) that 
way.  it helps in winter as well as in summer.   I have had to waller out the 
hole on the bracket or not screw the thermostat onto the rod as much to 
adjust the thermostat to close stuff all the way.  the bit on the flaps where 
the rod goes on gets mushed up, so if you have that fan housing off, check 
that out .  Eric says you should fit a popsicle stick under the curve (not 
the thin way, but the wider way).  Factory spec = popsicle stick width.  :)   
Think I have some extra flap bits, if you are going to be at spring meet I 
could bring them.

The mystery motor in my 65 had that extra hole in the rear tin, and a metal 
tube (small) from the intake manifold going through that hole, no clue what 
it is, I swapped out the tin and blocked off the hole in the manifold.  think 
the guy said it was from a 73 or 74 bug.

 &gt;what is your pre heat system like?
 
 i have what i guess is a slight mishmosh... mostly FI.
 
 i have the little thangies that cover up the heatriser/muffler junction,
 the ones that go just in front of the riser tube and screw onto the
 cylinder tin. FI stuff, i think,
 i have a FI doghouse with the thermostat and flaps; tho due to a likely
 tweaked fulcrum on the righthand flap, the flaps never close more than
 halfway. you can't move the thermostat enough on the bracket to close em. i
 twisted the fulcrum into a better shape oncet, but once tweaked they tend
 to stay that way - the curve has to be   j u s t   right for the flaps to
 work properly. need to get another flap set!
 
 have a preheat hose going from the pushrod area on the right side, up thru
 the rear tin, and into the early-bay aircleaner's preheat snout. the
 aircleaner has a little thermostatic pushrod for the main intake flap, and
 i adjusted it to be nearly closed... thermostat might not work, looking for
 a spare one. tho that would just be a prob in summer, really.
 the rear tin has an extra, 1/2&quot; hole just in front of the preheater hose,
 which i think is another FI doodad that i don't have/need? so i gotta plug
 that hole.
 heat riser has the two gaskets, little hole one on the left.
 seals have seen better days, and are needing replacement, but are 90% there
 - 1&quot; hole on left side where it meets the apron.
 
 
 so basically i have a COMPLETE, if needing-adjusted,  preheat system.
 
 need to straighten it out before it gets damp/cold again...
 i had ice above the throttle plate... hell, the carb bolts had ice on em!
 was kinda cool, in a physics-demonstration way.
