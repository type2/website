You're going to have to drill/cut the welds - I think they're spot-wleded

You want to re-weld it.  A screw won't be strong enough, and there isn't enough room inside the frame for a very big screw at that...

&gt; My 67 kombi has trashed popout frames but all the little latch-attachment

&gt; 
&gt; now, how do i get the latch things from the bad frames to the good ones.
&gt; specifically:
&gt; what is the best way to get those buggers off, a chisel?
&gt; what is the best way to reattach to the frames i have?
