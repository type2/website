The pictures look like the contents of an obsolete parts room at an old
VW dealership. Although the room looks bigger than most that I've seen
in the past. The contents are exactly what I've found in the past,
especially the Type III stuff and the backup light switches.
If you have never been privy to a stash like this, the dealer in the old
days would move slow moving parts inventory to an old room out back or
upstairs to languish until somebody got close enough to the parts
manager ( or asked the right questions) to to be able to &quot;rediscover&quot; it
after it had sat for many years.
If you know of any older VW dealerships in your area you can go in and
ask them to see this room if it hasn't already been &quot;rediscovered&quot;. They
are happy most of the time to clear the stuff out at a great &quot;take it
all&quot; package price.
