Wise and Holy list,
                            At first I too thought of the possibilities of the 13 to 21 conversion, restoration and fabrication is my trade for 20+. The roof is an easy graft if you take the time to drill spotwelds correctly. But then came the relization that any 21 exists in its own place waiting for a aresto and the 13, as clara points out does not have a big hole waiting for water to enter.  So back to the secret decoder ring, where do I find the key to unlock  M-codes? 
  Another area of question is deluxes have heat front and rear, and it appears that po has capped of one tube. The center forward tube has  a pvc tube replacement. The biggie here is right rear floor has a gaping hole where i would assume the rear heat vent to be. Why would someone cut this out? does it take floor space.? Bus came with no rear seats but i have in short time found correct rear seat w/ bars white/acqua and the elusive middle seat 2/3 white/acqua for the happily paid amount of 50 bucks :&gt;) Get this,  seats were 50 miles apart and surely not from the same bus. As the po had black seats upfront, they sprayed the seat back vinyl black, a little lacquer thinner, voila, ACQUA! 

Any body have the rear heat vent assembly? Another look for part,
i assume there are bows for the headliner on the 13, any bows or at the min. a length and bend measurement. Thanks for this purely bus
related messaging space...
