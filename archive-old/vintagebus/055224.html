Subject: Original?

I was just thumbing through one of the new VW rags and
stumbled upon an article that left me with a question.
What would the definition be for an &quot;original bus&quot;. I
would assume that an original bus would be unrestored.
That means cleaned up and displayed. It doesn't seem
right to have had the vehicle painted, re-upolstered,
accessories added and then displayed as original. The
bus in question is a VERY nice bus but as far as i am
concerned NOT original. Stock yes, original no. Am I
off here?
