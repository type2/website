Jim et al,

Since I've got to replace the underside and the topside of my cargo floors in my deluxe, I've thought of an even different use for this area: stowage. I've thought of putting in a spare fuel tank, water storage, etc. The problem is, I can't do any of this without significant access holes in the top floor panels. Anyway, I just thought I'd toss this out; people already think I'm insane, so I have nothing left to prove.

I wonder if thicker, stronger panels below would provide added rigidity enough to compensate for the loss of contiguous surface area up top?


Thanks! Joe
