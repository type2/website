Well yes, I never suggested scanning and burning the originals :(

I've been trying to buy all the early lit I can to scan and put on my
page.  There have been some choice pieces that I didn't win on [auction site]
that I really would have lived to put up on my site, like the barndoor
safari window installation manual addendum.  Unfortunately, the winner 
refused to scan it for me.

OTOT, scanning these and making them available &quot;devalues&quot; the originals,
but oh-well - I ain't in it for the money.

&gt; paper has kept better. Moral is, keep the hard copy.     Then again, most of 
&gt; use can't find a copy of this, hooray for making it available!!!!
