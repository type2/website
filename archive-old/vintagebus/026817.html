Subject: Oil pump vs case

Hey y'all
I'm starting the assembly process and thought I'd check the oil pump
port against the case (new brazilian universal) openings.  The oil pump
(melling) intake port's fine.  The outlet port only opens to about half
of the case port.  Is it ok to open the oil pump port to better match
the case?  The only problem I see (besides having to &quot;modify&quot; a new
unit) might be leakage back into the case.  I don't believe this will be
much of a problem.  I plan on going full flow remote filter anyhow so
should I just leave it alone?  If I don't go full flow remote then I
have a restricted oil pump outlet.  Can you say expensive grenade?

Please advise me o collective of arcane VW knowledge!
Dave
