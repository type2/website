&lt;&lt; The other question is about the woodruff keys on the crank.  One large and 
one small.  Can these be re-used?&gt;&gt;

Hi Steve,
As long as they have not been deformed they can be reused.
 
&lt;&lt;Again, anyone have a good straight long 8 mm stud laying around I can 
have(buy)?? &gt;&gt;

Can you give us a length?  There were many lengths for the 10mm ones and at 
least three for the 8mm.    Eric&amp;Barb
