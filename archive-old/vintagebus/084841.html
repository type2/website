&gt; I then slid under the bus and with a big screw driver connected the
&gt; two post.  All I heard was a whirl.

If the whirl sounded smooth and not grindy or gritty, this is the
correct response.

The starter solenoid - the little cylinder on top of the starter motor -
has two jobs.  One is to make an _electrical_ connection between the
battery and the starter so the starter motor can turn.  The other is to
make a _mechanical_ connection between the starter and the flywheel so
the turning starter can turn the engine.

When you bridge the two big posts with your screwdriver, you're simulating
the electrical half of the job.  The starter motor will spin, but not
engage the engine.  You'll hear the starter motor running, but not the
usual engine-cranking sounds that you hear when you use the ignition key.

If you bridge the big post with the battery cable on it to the small tab
with the (relatively) thin red wire on it, you're simulating what the
ignition switch does.  The solenoid should do both jobs - start turning
the starter motor and engage the starter motor to the engine.  It should
sound just like it does when you're sitting in the cab turning the
ignition key.  It will be a little louder because your head is right
under the engine, and because most people shout when their Bus runs them
over.  Remember to make *sure* it's not in gear...
