Subject: Hydraulic lock; was: water hammer?

I was mistaken. It was gas and it drained down a high fuel line to the right carb. after the
engine was shut down. I have rerouted the line and no more problem. Now both my lines come
up to the carbs so they won't over flow the bowls and run over the vents down the intake
into whatever cylinder has an open valve. Thanks to those who tried to help me with this.

Mike
