Subject: Re: [VB] questions about taller tires with IRS

Not to start the dreaded tire thread, but I have a question about some
tires that were on the Dana Nye full tilt 67 double cab...tow hook and
cyclone aircleaner and all ;-)

The truck was running some Continental &quot;conti&quot; something tires.  I did'nt
get a good look at them.  Too busy running around looking for OG safari
parts (who spent C note on the two NOS latches?).  Anyway, they looked
really good on the truck....more ahh truck like...if there is such a thing.
  They had a bit more agressive lug than the standard bus tire I have on my
truck.

Thanks for any insight.

Steve
