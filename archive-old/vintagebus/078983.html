Subject: bus sighting in La Grande

I was driving west bound on island ave in La Grande Oregon on Monday.
about 8 pm and what do I see but a chestnut over red deluxe driving in
the opposite direction.   I started stammering and the wife and boy
started looking.  I quickly turned around to watch it turn right and
appear to enter back onto the I84 going East toward Boise.  Had a brake
light on the decklid but to tell the truth, in my amazement to simply
*see* another bus in La Grande I can't say much more about it.  Stock
height, not polished, but looked reasonably nice.  . We were all too
tired to follow and chase it down on the freeway from a weekend of
camping and hiking up the Lostine River (ref. for all the wetwesties :-)
)

 

 

Anyone have a clue who/what it was?
