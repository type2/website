Subject: Archive of old VW articles needs home.

I have just finished a 4 day project of scanning and archiving old VW
related articles out of Popular Science and Mechanix Illustrated articles
dating hit or miss from 1951 through the late 60's early 70's.  I don't have
all the issues of either mag but I went through a stack of about 30 of them
page by page and tagged all the VW related info.  There is some awesome
stuff in there!

I've named all the files appropriately and written up a bibliography for
every photo.  The majority of them are B&amp;W photos and they are already for
use on a website.  I've reduced color photos to 256 colors and B&amp;W greyscale
stuff to 16 colors which is a pleasant compromise between file size and
legibility.

All but 4 of the photos I scanned in.  Thanks to the listee whose name I've
already forgotten for scanning in the 1954 review of the 54 Kombi.  I have
in this archive (3.26 megs of legible scans) articles reviewing the
Notchback (where they say it has an OHC design and is destined for the USA),
detailing changes between the oval window and square window beetle, articles
featuring panels with ads on the side, blurbs about shockless and springless
beetles (special wheels), VW adding a fuel guage to the beetle, and the list
goes on and on.  This is good stuff.  Mainly Splitwindow Bus and Beetle is
featured in these articles.

Would someone like to host these scans?  I'm sure the list would appreciate
having this available.  Some of it may even be worthy of submission to
www.vintagebus_dot_com as well.  I'm kind of hoping that the guys that stepped
forwards and hosted the article called Europe's Model-A (featuring the oval
window beetle back in the 50's) would like to host more of these articles
but I understand of web space is an issue.  3.26MB is a lot (and that is in
zip format but there is little compression due to the jpg format)

Lemme know if you'd like the archive.  I'll gladly email to you - even if
you can't host the pictures, I'll still send you a copy...
