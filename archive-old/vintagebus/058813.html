Subject: RE: [VB] Has anyone noticed the new MacDonald's commercial?

  One of the things that always happens in my house when watching the tube
is to see how many VW we can spot in a TV show or movie. It seems my 6 and 9
year old or my wife seem to spot them before me. It's amazing how almost
every movie made will have at least 1 VW in the backround, somewhere.

ronnie   

ps. now if I could only spot them that easy when I'm out on the road.
pps. finishing up the parts stash find this weekend. I also got a 63 GHIA
out of there, steam cleaner, Honda trail 90 and am going to try and get all
the EMPI stuff tomorrow.

Sounds like my wife whenever my VW-radar picks up any old veedub on TV. 
Especially when I proceed to tell her what year it is.
