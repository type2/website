Subject: Re: [VB] #1 California VW show?

Well,
for an all around good time...err, best bang for your buck...that would be the Classic weekend.
VTO campout friday, OCTO show on Saturday, and the Classic on Sunday.  With lots of other stuff in between if your game.

Should be sometime mid-June---check thesamba_dot_com for dates.

&gt; List,
&gt; 
&gt; I just moved to California and would like to invite my brother, who
&gt; surpasses me as a VW nut, to a VW show in California.  What are your
&gt; recommendations?  He'll only get to come once probably, and he's a fan of
&gt; all vintage and race VW's.  What show would be the best to fly him in for?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
