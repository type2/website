It's more of an opportunistic philosophy than a physical list..

I saw bullet-light sheetmetal sections listed on ebay last week as &quot;rare&quot;

&gt; What is this rarest of the rare list and where can I get a copy? Ive seen it 
&gt; referred to on ebay multiple times but the parts that are listed w/ it are 
&gt; things such as doors, spoon popout latches, and stock gauges(kinda suprising 
&gt; because of the number of vehicles it came on?)?
