&gt;This is something I've often thought of doing.  Go to an event where people
&gt;
&gt;have to walk quite a ways from the parking area to the event.  Cruise around
&gt;
&gt;in your bus or bug with a sign that says, &quot;Rides $1.00 ea.&quot;  Might not make
&gt;
&gt;a killing at it but you'd meet a lot of people and see a lot of smiling
&gt;
&gt;faces. :-)

When my wife and I got married, we used my 58 15 window to &quot;shuttle&quot; people 
down the street to and from their cars.  We live at the very end of a narrow 
dead end street and it was the only way we could keep traffic jams from 
happening.
My wife was also delivered to the house in a friends 51 split beetle just 
before the ceremony.  Everyone smiled when they got out of the bus.
