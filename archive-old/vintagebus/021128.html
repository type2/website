Subject: Re: [VB] undercover cops at jerome

Maybe you should tell
&gt; your friends to smoke there dope at home, not out in
&gt; public. 

Mike,

Rachel WAS asking for her friends.  I know her, and
KNOW that dope smoking is not her interest.  But you
are right, there are people smoking in too many public
situations at shows, and I know that this year at
Jerome (undercover cops or not) I'm going to ask any
people breaking the law to find another area to camp,
or to find another campfire to hang to hang out at.

At the Corona de Tucson show this year, the vets told
us if they smelled the evil weed again, that they
would call the cops, and I don't blame them.  I smoked
more than tobacco for many years, but I hope I never
brought anyone else's property into jeopardy.

Anyway, if there are undercover cops at Jerome, I hope
they'll stop those underage drinkers from keeping an
ex-hippie awake past his bedtime!

JP

PS And this year, if anybody keeps me awake too late,
I'm going to turn my firepit upsidedown!
