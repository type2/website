&lt;&lt; cleaning out the grease and replacing with fresh really helps.  &gt;&gt;

Hi Volks,
Absolutely!  Though make sure to use a light grease such as white lithium and 
only fill the gear box no fuller than 1/4 to 1/3!   A must for any and all 
wiper motors that have not been done this to in the last ten years even if it 
is NOS, or if it is a mystery wiper motor.    Eric&amp;Barb
