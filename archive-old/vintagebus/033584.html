Subject: Another gone, Havasu

   This weekend Matt, Katie (1959kombi) and there friend Rich came to Havasu
and purchased Matts (original LBB member) 1960 DD panel. They left Havasu in
100 plus heat for the drive back to Cali (300 plus miles), the 60 DD made it
back with only a couple little problems, which were solved on the road. The
bus had a NEW 1776 with less then 50 miles on it when they left, what a way
to break it in, a major road trip in 100 degree plus heat. The bus went to a
good home and am looking forward to seeing it at all the Cali shows, Rich
just got one heck of a nice, rust free bus.
   The buses in Havasu are dwindling, guess VWHoward and I will have to go
find some more to bring the Havasu population back up.
