&gt;Can you elaborate on the differences SwepCo 201 made Thom?  That's
&gt;pretty spendy for something that just _might_ do something a little
&gt;better.

My other car is a 1977 911S widebody targa
(http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/porsche.html) whose transmission is getting long
in the tooth (arf!).  The first time I changed the oil in it, the oil was
way too icky, and I got 4 pieces of selector ring in the magnetic plug.

The symptoms of my transmission problem are a stiff second gear, and an
occaisional steel wall trying to get into first.  You move the lever, and
it feels like it's not supposed to go that direction. If I put it in
neutral, let out the clutch, and then try, it goes in.

Changing to SwepCo 201 has made it much easier to get into first, although
I still get the steel wall every now and then, but I'll hazard it's 90%
better.  Getting into 2nd and 3rd is much easier as well.  Porsche people
swear by swepco.  The swear *at* redline MTL.  

Unfortunately, I will still need the transmission gone through, and SwepCo
201 is not some magic fix, ala Slick50 (arf!) so I still have a $2500
rebuild hanging over my head - thats the price to pay when you run with the
big boys.

Here's what I'll do: tomorrow, if I get a chance, I'll order 2 more gallons
of the swepco juice, and do the '56.  The tranny in the '56 is fairly good;
it's a rebuild by carters, although it's still a bit sticky getting thru
the gears.  Right now it has StaLube 85/140 in it.  After I do this, I'll
let the list know what I find out.  Cool?
