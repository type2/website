Subject: Bus wheels question

I just uncovered a large stash of old VW wheels,
supposedly there are some 15&quot; bus wheels.  I would
like to sort them out, but I'm not sure how to tell
them apart.  What are the measurements that
differentiate bus wheels? Also, if I do come across
some of these wheels, what is current market value?

Thanks in advance
Matt
