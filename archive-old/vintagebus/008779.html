Here's the later fuel tap with it's little &quot;arm&quot;:

It has a choke cable-style cable that hooks up to it via the same clamp that
is used for the accelerator cable at the carb.

The only thing you would missing is that there is a big bracket underneath
the tank that holds the end of the cable in place.

&gt;Do you really mean BD?  Or just the later fuel tap?
&gt;
&gt;The Barndoor one has a little lever to turn it on/off/reserve, here's a
&gt;pic from the owner's manual:

Yup, I meant BD, as that is the style reserve tap I bought... what I DIDN'T
know is that there a few diff styles of actuating the tap!
Everett's photo shows a neat pic of a bus w/ a hole in the passenger side
-  you could stick a churchkey dealie in there and use it to flip the tap
lever around.
Thom kindly sent me some pics of BDs that  showed a different set-up

 where the tank is mounted in the engine bay, and the tap is reachable by
opening the hatch.
Thanks guys!
THEN there is the post-BD way, w/ a cable from the cab. So I guess what I
need is pics of THAT set-up, and I'll see if it's feasible to juryrig
sumpin.
Otherwise, I'll just poke a hole in that rusty side panel and stick a
wrench in there :)
