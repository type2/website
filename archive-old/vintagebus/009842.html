Hi,

I forgot the starter!!!! Gosh, the engine turns over so fast that it starts
before I can let go of the key! Its great! I have however replaced a couple
of starters over the years.

&gt;&gt; Hi all,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I have been running my 6v wipers on 12V for about 20 years. No Problem!.
Now
&gt;&gt; they are fast enough to keep up with a real rain storm. The motor doesn't
&gt;&gt; even get hot. Soooo, don't worry, run your 6v motors on 12V! As for the
&gt;&gt; radio, it may burn out on the extra volts. The gas gage just pegs. What
else
&gt;&gt; is there? All the light bulbs are replaceable with 12V units.

&gt;me too, about 12 years. Starter as well... I keep expecting them to burn
&gt;out. I have a 12v wiper motor to swap in when it finally goes, but the
&gt;damn thing refuses to break. I may go ahead and put a 12v flywheel and
&gt;starter in at next engine-out, but then again, I may just run the 6v
&gt;starter until it fries too. I like the !whiiiing! sound of a 6v starter
&gt;under 12v. Sounds like home to me.
