 &lt;&lt;  Is the alternator THAT much better??? &gt;&gt;
 Hi Mark,
 It depends on how much wattage used over how much time while camping, and 
how 
 many miles of driving between, how many batteries in your camper, and what 
 type and size of batteries to really figure out if an alternator would be 
 absolutely nessasary for you.  We have had friends go to alternator to find 
 they are more likely to burn out due to wiring problems/mistakes, but if you 
 make sure your wiring is in good condition that should most likely not be a 
 problem.  Also the alternator requires a special fuel pump which you can not 
 rebuild, a special shorter fuel pump push rod, alternator stand and probably 
 the fanshroud to alternator tin.    Eric&amp;Barb

i didn't think the alternator takes any fuel.   :)

I do have a nalternator in my 65, but just cause it came on an engine that I 
aquired and it works.   Use a regular fuel pump on the motor.   left the VR 
and bus wiring to it in pplace and made a couple wires that jump over to the 
alternator.   I have a generator on my bug, have left the lights on for a few 
hours (oops) but it still started with my cheapee battery.  

if it aint broke dont fix it
