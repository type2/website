Subject: Upholstery work

Hi list,
I'm rebuilding the camper interior in my Sundial Camper, and it's time to
start thinking about the upholstery work.  I need to do the 2 cushions on
the Z-Bed, the 2 cushions on the jump seat, (I have a walkthru), and the
cushion behind the Z-Bed that goes above the engine bay.

I've already purchased the materials, and I'm wondering if anyone on the
list has had this work done and can tell me how much the labor for the
upholstery work might cost?  Also, living in Southern California, I'm
considering going south of the border to Tijuana to get the work done.
Anyone one the list done this?

Thanks,
Ed
