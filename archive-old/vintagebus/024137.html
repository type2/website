&lt;&lt; here is an ad for them on vwplanet under accessories for busses if i am bot
 mistaken- i have the guys address at work otherwise. $5 for 2 arms so they
 ain't cheap. good point re: the mirrors- then again are the mirrors that
 different from the round ones that are being repopped? what makes the mirrors
 different??
 ===================
the mirrors are rectangular with rounded edge, not circles.  They are also 
larger.   They do not use the clamps like the circles do.  the arms slide 
through a mounted hole in the mirror, there is a set screw.    Have found 
some at swapo meets $10-$20, but real uncommon.   THey weren't a big drool 
item with people pushing, just real hard to find for the person who recogises 
it and wants it.

why are they reproing the arms and not mirrors?   silly

 Who is selling them?  Where?  We were hoping they would be wider to give a
 better view especially the passenger side.

 &gt; &lt;&lt; speaking of mirrors has anyone seen the repro'ed &quot;harp&quot; mirrors (the
 ones
 &gt; w/
 &gt;  the diagonal reinforcement?)The mirrors haven't been re-produced, only the
 &gt; arms. The actual mirrors
 &gt; themselves are the hardest part to find.
