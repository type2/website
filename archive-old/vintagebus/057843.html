Subject: RE: [VB] Westy Paint-Sikkens or Special Kolor

Sealing Wax Red Trucks are one solid color and they are SK654E.

- Everett

&gt;I was thinking, if SK did in fact mean special kolor, and that is based
on
&gt;Kombi's being one color, except in the case of early Westies when they
are
&gt;painted in the two-tone scheme, then maybe the we should look at what is=

&gt;on the M-code plate for a Dove Blue Westy?  It's still a Kombi, but in
this
&gt;case it is the typical single color.  If the M-code plate still has the
SK
&gt;identifier in front of the color code, then one could assume SK refers
to
&gt;Sikkens paint.  If there is no SK identifier, then one could assume that=

&gt;it does in fact stand for Special Kolor, as in the case of a Dove Blue
Westy
&gt;(Kombi) it isn't a &quot;special color&quot; and the SK is not there to represent
that.
&gt; Good logic???
