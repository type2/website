&lt;&lt;  For 65 with emergency flashers is unavailable but the listed price was  
$130!!! Any reason why such a big jump.  Will anything else work? &gt;&gt;
Hi Snoopy,
Would help if you had a part number for what you were looking for.  The 1965 
an earlier signal, and E-flashers should be the same.  Only in 1966-67 did 
the all in one big boxes with nine wores going into them as far as we know 
end up way over $130.00.  We do have a NOS 1966 six volt blinker/E-flasher 
box for sale if anyone what an original.   Eric&amp;Barb
