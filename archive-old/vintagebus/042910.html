My folks live in Coeur d'Alene and I have seen a really nice Blue/white
21-window around town, but never got to chat with the owner.  With no VW
club in the area it's hard to know all the VW drivers in the area as hard
as I try to meet everyone I see that drives an old bus (or bug).  If
anyone on the list lives in the Coeur d'Alene/Post Falls or even Spokane
area and wants to get a club started let me know!

&gt; Is it a listee?  It's White over Blue, looks to be in mint condition.
&gt; Bow-wow sticker on the back window, among others.
