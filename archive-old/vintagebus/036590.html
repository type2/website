Hi Volks,
Definitely!  We helped a gal who showed up at our local bus club in Seattle 
with the same problem.  She complained of the engine running too hot in 50F 
weather.  Opened the engine compartment and reached around to the fan with 
the engine off.   Found a sheet of notebook paper had been sucked through one 
of the engine air intake slits and in to block the cooling fan!  Eric&amp;Barb
