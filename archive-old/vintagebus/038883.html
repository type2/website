When I bought my 62 Single Cab, Neither the Vin behind the seat, the one in the
engine compartment nor the one on the title matched. And It wasn't that hard to
get it cleared up. I went to the DMV bill of sale and title in hand, they gave
me a bunch of forms and sent me to the Oregon State Police. I made an
appointment, the sheriff inspected the vehicle with a wire brush, flash light,
and scraper, once satisfied he had all the numbers he plugged them into his
computer to do a title search. Oddly all three of the numbers came up clean, He
removed the Vin from behind the seat (it was a 63 anyway) punched the one out of
the engine compartment (only 3 numbers still legible) and assigned me a new
Oregon Vin Number, stuck the plate on himself, The DMV sent me a clean title.
However its registered as a 63 not a 62 but who's complaining, the e-flashers
work and the mice are gone (for now)

Just be polite and follow their processes
