&gt;   The silicon based DOT 5 will gum up your brake light

&gt; there that is attached to the frame rail and actuated by 
&gt; movement in the pedal arm. Lights go on before the brake 
&gt; travels through its free play, it's great for telling 
&gt; tailgaters to back off without actually braking.

DOT5 fluid may or may not be compatible with all the materials in your
brake system.  No guarantees!  Also, DOT5 fluid will not absorb water,
which sounds good, but consider that any water that ends up in the system
will go to the lowest points, the wheel cylinders, where it will do its
corrosive evil if you don't bleed then now and then.

I play it safe with DOT3 and DOT4
