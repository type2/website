Subject: Re: [VB] Flipseat westies

  They were made out of walkthrough buses, not bench seat buses, which changes the structurality.  

I don't think the flipseat westies give much back support in case of an accicent.  

well, they didn't have seat belts or headrests either  around 1960, so safety... well, probably has been improved since then.

No, flip hatch westies didn't have subfloors.   Only the buses with the sunroof or double doors both sides.   Small pop top and hatchtop westies still have the frame reinforcement for the roof... (where the rear interior light goes) and so they figured the subfloors weren't needed.

&gt; seriously reducing the strength of the bus - ie removing the bulkhead?
&gt; 
&gt; Did they just do it without thinking about it or is it safe 
&gt; to have a bus
&gt; without a bulkhead?
&gt; 
&gt; This particular one didn't have belly pans either.
