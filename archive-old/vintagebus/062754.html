Subject: New to the list

Hello one and all,

I just bought my first Bus, a 1966 13 Window Deluxe( #169,938) and it was
truly a dream come true for me.  This is my first ever air cooled VW, I have
owned 11 A1 VW's so my learning curve is a tad sharp. I will lurk the list
learning new things everyday.  I am so appreciative of the sharing of
knowledge on this list.  So I will start off with my first question, I tried
adjusting the heater cables last nite, but it seems the flappers in the heat
exchangers are just not too effective at blocking off the flow of warm air.
It's hot enough in Austin with out heat coming thru the defrost ducts!  So I
made alum. caps and closed each end of the heat exchangers heading forward
of the motor.  Question is, are the flaps inside replaceable? repairable?
without replacing the entire heat exchangers.

Thanks for your time,

Gary P Alexander
