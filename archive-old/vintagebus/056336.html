&gt;
&gt; &gt; The MVVC has an idea on how to get VW's attention in regard to the
&gt; &quot;Trademark Issue&quot;, and we need your help. We have come up with a on line
&gt; protest letter. Please go to www.mvvc_dot_net , click on the Protest Letter
&gt; icon, and fill out the boxes. We at the MVVC feel that the ONLY way anyone
&gt; is going to get VW&quot;s attention on this matter is to demonstrate how their
&gt; current actions WILL affect future sales of VW's. We have heard thru
various
&gt; channels that there is a small minority at VW who realize the stupidity of
&gt; the company's current actions. The demographic information compiled from
&gt; these protest letters will enable that minority to show corporate the
&quot;error
&gt; of their ways&quot;.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;The MVVC plans on presenting copies of these protest letters to VW at
the
&gt; end of our May 19th show. We also plan on providing this information on CD
&gt; to anyone, and everyone at VW that might be interested. Board members,
&gt; advertising agency's ( got a contact idea, name, whatever, contact
&gt; ernie_at_mvvc_dot_net , ron_at_mvvc_dot_net or ed_at_mvvc_dot_net
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;But, in order for this to work we need honest, truthful responses, and
as
&gt; many as we can get. 500 responses would be good, 5000 should really get
VW's
&gt; attention. As time is getting shorter to our show date we need you to
spread
&gt; the word, not just to the enthusiast but anyone you know that is a fan of
&gt; VW, or anyone you know who might be interested in purchasing a new VW.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Dean Kirsten and his editorial was great, Bill Collins letter to VW
said
&gt; it all, now it's our turn. Go on line and fill out the letter. Help us
show
&gt; Corporate how the VW hobby really feels about this.
