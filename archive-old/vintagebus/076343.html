Subject: Oil leak from nosecone

My bus is a 66 model built end jan beginning of Feb 66.  According to the
Bentley only buses after Feb had a seal on the nosecone so therefore should I
expect an oil leak from where the hockey stick goes into the nosecone?

It is not a really serious leak, after a week of no use I get a small oil
patch around 2&quot; in diameter.

If I shouldn't have this leak is the problem due to wear in the nosecone
bushes?  If so where can I get these from - can't see them at any shop here in
the UK - but maybe someone can recommend someone over in the USA who can ship
them to me.

Thanks
Paul
