&lt;&lt; Where did VW put the stock antenna on busses with safari windows? And what 
kind of mount was it? (the long, single mount at the bottom? or the one with 
the
 two circuler mounts?) &gt;&gt;
Hi Jason,
Here in the US at least VW was not legally allowed to import radios in thier 
new VWs so no stock ones from the factory floor.  It was felt that USA radio 
manufactures would have much less chance of sales if brand new imports came 
with a radio.  Which in turn is the reason that antennias were also a dealer 
or later installation.  VOA to supply radios contracted with Motorala AKA 
Bendix for inexpensive domestic dealer installed radios.
  So to ansewer your question as best as possible would be all of the above 
and many more!  Eric&amp;Barb
