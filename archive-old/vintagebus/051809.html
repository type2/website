 Hi Thomas,
 You do not need to get the axles level to install the axle boots.  The main 
 thing is to install the split boots with the seam 30-45 degrees from TDC.  
If 
 you have the seam on the forward side of the axle you can replace it later 
 with the engine in easily.  Well fairly easily.... &gt;&gt;

and the screw heads pointed down where you can get to them easily with engine 
in.
