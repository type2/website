Subject: Wolfsden Imports?

Hi list-

Anybody know what happened to Wolfsden Imports - specifically Jonn 
Flores?  The email address and phone number I have do not connect. 
He was in Poulsbo, WA.

I am finally getting around to installing the TMI seat covers I 
bought from him (who knew the bodywork was going to take 7 months!), 
and have discovered that the ones for the rear seat were not included 
with the order!

Any help in chasing this down would be appreciated.
