&gt; hey all, i have a couple questions...
&gt; i have been driving my bus for almost 4 months since the snow stopped flying 
&gt; and have a few questions. (1) im only getting about 17 mpg, whats the order 
&gt; of things i should check to improve? carb? points? plugs? my mechanic says 
&gt; thats ok, you guys all seem to get 30!!

Asking someone about their gas mileage is a bit like asking them about
their sex life.  The only person who is likely to tell the truth about
either subject is a priest.  I'll pretend I'm a priest, but I'll only tell
you about my mileage, not the other thing.

I get a truthful 18-20MPG in my '71 bus running a fresh Mexican engine.  I
got about the same with my tired original engine.  This is over typical
Western terrain of flat deserts and mountain passes and cruising at
57-60MPH (actual).

IMO, it is possible to get better mileage from a bus, but it would take
good tuning skills and careful driving.

If you were to go to a well-engineered closed-loop fuel injection and
ignition system, then 30 would be possible.  The cost would pay for a lot
of wasted fuel, though!

 :) (2) this is puzzling to me... i 
&gt; have a small nut tranny in my EARLY '66 converted to 12V. while cruising 
&gt; down the freeway on this newly paved stretch (flat) i look down and im doin' 
&gt; 70, easy.

VW speedometers can be very optomistic.  My speedo reads 75 when I'm
actually going 58.  I use a GPS to get the true speed.

My odometer is also a bit optomistic, due to modern tires being a bit
smaller in OD than the OEM tires.  This would make your mileage seem a bit
better than it really is.
