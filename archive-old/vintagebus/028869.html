&gt; &gt;     making the vehicle stop as fast and as safely as it did when it left
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; showroom is IMHO logical.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Naturally. Turning the drums is just an unnecessarily expensive way of
&gt; arriving at the state.

so don't turn the drums... but neither can you expect your bus to stop as
surefootedly or as safely as it did when coming off the boat.... slapping a set
of shoes on your bus just doesn't make everything all brand new... this work is
not for the unsupervised novice, but it is not hard to pick up...
it takes two surfaces to come up with the coefficient of friction. the lining is
but one.

&gt; A brake system is not automatically better because of having the drums
&gt; turned, or simply because a certified mechanic did the work.

of course... it takes more than checking and renewing just one part of the whole
arrangement. bush-league mechanicking will get you bush-league brakes,
regardless of who does it..

&gt; Most shops hire one or two certified mechanics
&gt; and then fill the bays with pointy-headed parts changers.

    your fears are likely as unjustified as your hasty and derogatory
generalizations about the automotive maintenance industry.
    i think the &quot;loose drain plug&quot; story is probably on an urban legends website
somewhere... though i am sure this happens from time to time, it is still a
classic paranoia-inducing tale.
    did you ever hear the one about the ASE-certified technician with a hook for
a hand?
    there are dishonest customers that loosen their own drain plugs soon after
an oil change and claim the shop did it/get the new engine or tranny or
whatever... for shame.
    If you cannot speak directly to the tech who is about to do your work, i'd
think about going somewhere else... it is very important to do this, and a lot
of times the tech will pick up on things that service writers won't.
    It's *your* choice who works on your vehicle... like clara said, &quot;how many
people are going to care as much about my bus as i do, ayways?&quot;..... if the
choice is yourself, great... just do it by the book, sans shortcuts. If you want
one of the shop's brakes-certified techs to do your brake job, that is your
option also...
    If you don't do it... find a technician or shop you trust to do the work...
but verify that the work has been done and done properly.
    trust, but verify...
