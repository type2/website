Subject: Sorry, but...another gear oil ??
To: VintageBus_at_type2_dot_com

Sorry to bring up an old subject (one I didn't pay complete attention to), 
but I am faced with replacing my tranny (soon, Ronnie, soon) and need to get 
re-educated on gear oil.  As I recall, GL-5 is bad, GL-4 is good.  I called 
my oil supplier that I use at work and asked for a gear lube with only a GL-4 
rating.  They could not come up with one.  They did, however, come up with a 
lube saying it meets GL-3 and GL-4 specs.  Would this be acceptable?  The 
person I spoke with read some of the label for me over the phone and it says 
that it is for &quot;older&quot; manual and &quot;semi-automatic stick shift&quot; transmissions.

Comments?

TIA
