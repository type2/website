&lt;&lt; I was going to post a general oil pump/ filter question to the list, but I 
guess
 you'd end up answering any way.  Here goes.&gt;&gt;
Hi Steve,
    Hope you do not mind that we will post both your questions to the list 
and our ansewers.  After all someone else might some other pointers on this 
subject.  

&lt;&gt;
     Okay first you need to see if any of these you have are for the early 
cam or the later dished cam.  Plus it would be best to have a new or good 
used stock pump in hand to compare.  First to make room inside of the pump 
casting for the outlet passage that has to be now completely seperate from 
the gear bores in these filter pumps the manufactures have to make the pump 
gears and bores smaller in diameter.  If they left these smaller diameter 
gears the same length as stock gears the filter pumps would not pump as much 
and not as high of pressure through the restriction of the oil filter as the 
stock pumps.  So the manufactures make thier gears longer.  This means that 
they have to make the pump body deeper both into the engine case and out 
toward the rear.  Not too much out the rear though or the filter casting will 
push the engine tin in front of the lower pulley into the front side of the 
pulley.  So they make the gears deeper into the pump housing and engine case. 
 Now take out the upper gears out of one of the filter pumps and the stock 
pump you have to compare these gears.  You will see that the shaft that these 
gears are pressed on is also the bearing surface for these upper gears.  
While the lower gear rides on a steel shaft pressed into the oil pump body.  
In other words when the upper shaft and/or the bore they ride in wears these 
upper gears get pushed out farther and farther upward and begine to cut the 
upper side of the gear bore.  Which in turn reduces the output due to worse 
and worse wear and tolerances.  Since the filter gear is longer than stock 
this means that the bearing surface of this upper shaft is reduced in the 
filter pump and thusly may result in wearing out faster than the stock pump.  
Also if you just use an aftermarket larger stock style or filter pump this 
may just cause the relief valve to be open to the sump due to oil 
overpressure most of the time.  So the longest and biggest diameter geared 
filter pump might not be the best.  Due to lack of bearing surface for the 
upper gear and maybe putting out too much pressure that is not needed which 
will just waste HP.  So you might want to go with the filter pump that has 
the shortest gears and see what pressure you get while driving, but before 
installing it make sure to create a pump puller bracket (Stock pullers will 
not pull out bigger stock style or filter pump bodies.)for this pump body so 
if the pressure is not enough you can pull it and install the next filter 
pump.  Also check these things out before installing any oil pumps.  There 
must be less than .008&quot; play between the pump gears, in other words you 
should not be able to fit a .008&quot; feeler gauge and it would be better not 
only to be only fit a .006&quot;, but .004&quot; would be far better.  Next not only 
check that the both the inlet and outlet passages to the pump will be matched 
up to the passages in the engine case, but that the inlet passages are of the 
same size.  Going from a small diameter inlet passage in the engine case to a 
large inlet passage in the oil pump is Okay, but going from a large engine 
case oil inlet passage to a small inlet in the oil pump case is not 
acceptable.  It is then important to drill/grind out the smaller oil pump 
inlet passage bigger to match the later engine large diameter inlet passage.  
This all is done easier with the engine apart, but can be done fairly well 
with the engine not only together, but in the VW if you take you time!  The 
best oil/filter pumps we have found so far are vintage EMPI pumps from the 
late 1960s.  They were for the single relief valve engine cases and thus have 
to have thier inlet passage drilled bigger for the later dual relief engine 
case.  Plus the upper gear is supported by a bearing surface in the 
filter/cover side of this gear.  Making the gear far more resistant to 
getting pushed up and away from the lower gear.   Eric&amp;Barb
  
PS Recently got to see the inside of a brand new Bugpack's filter/pump.  The 
upper gear was not only way out above .008&quot; play between the gears, but the 
upper gear shaft was loose in it's bore.  Plus the overall machining was 
garbage.   EEE&amp;B
