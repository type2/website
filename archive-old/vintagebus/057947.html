Subject: Pulley diameter math

Clara made the mistake of asking the following question:

&gt; Re Pulleys-
&gt; 
&gt; I know there are a number of different diameter lower pulleys out there, but
&gt; has anyone actually measured them and know what comes from what, what sizes
&gt; there are?  Or, actually, what diameter is the lower &quot;2:1&quot; pulley?  And where
&gt; are you measuring them?

I've been wondering about this too, so I decided to check into it. It's
even easier than the master cylinder math, so let's get right to it.

Since the pulleys are connected by the belt and the belt isn't
stretching or bunching up, all we have to do is compare the pitch
diameters of the pulleys to get the speed ratio of the pulleys. The
pitch diameter is pretty hard to measure.
What it is, is the diameter in the pulley that matches up with the part
of the belt that is neither stretching nor compressing as it wraps
around the pulley. The part of the belt outside the pitch diameter
stretches a little as it goes around the pulley and the part inside
compresses a little as it goes around. How did I find the pitch
diameter? I guessed, but I think you'll agree that I got close enough. I
just eyeballed the middle of the belt as I held up my tape measure by my
pulleys.

Here's what I found:

Crank Pulley: D stamped in it, 7&quot; OD, 6.25&quot; pitch dia.
Gen Pulley: 4.38&quot; OD, 3.75&quot; pitch dia.
circumference of any circle: pi*dia.

Crank circumference: pi*6.25&quot; = 19.64&quot;
Gen. circumference: pi*3.75&quot; = 11.78&quot;

ratio of crank to gen. : 19.64/11.78 = 1.67:1

To get a 2:1 ratio you would need 11.78 times 2 for the circumference of
the crank pulley or 23.56&quot;.
Dividing by pi yields a pitch diameter of about 7.5&quot;. The OD of that
pulley would be about 8 1/4&quot;. Anybody got one like that? I looked
through my junk and all of my crank pulleys measure about 7&quot; OD. I found
one aluminum pulley that measured 6 3/4&quot; OD, but I think it was still
about 6 1/4&quot; at the pitch diameter.

It looks like 1.6:1 is the standard setup.
