 only going 40mph! when i get out after a long run on the highway at about 
 55-60, she doesnt seem to be that hot. one time, while fueling up returning 
 from the Detroit show, i checked the oil and the dip was pretty f-in hot 
 though. i could just barely stand holding it. for a summer driver like me, 
 maybe an external would be the ticket.
 who knows,

ya- sounds like you have the 4.37/1.39 gearing, for the little motors that VW 
recommended not to drive above 50mph I think (3700 rpms?)    SO ya 40 on the 
freeway don't work too well.  when I had Truck I kept it to 52mph on the 
freeway, winding it up to 60 it screamed.   SO I didn't drive it on the 
freeway much, big deal.  But you know, touching something above 180 degrees F 
is pretty hot to touch, did the spit sizzle away when it hit the case-  that 
is my scientific Spit Test for is the motor too hot.  If it sits and sizzles 
its okay, if it steams away immediately too hot.

Perhaps a big nut tranny would be nicer for freeway driving?   Big PITA to do 
that though huh?
