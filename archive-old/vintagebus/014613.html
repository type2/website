 I need a stock shifter that will fit a '56/'57 bus.  And what years of
 shifters have the right diameter ball to fit into the shift linkage
 socket?  If anyone has a shifter that will work I would be glad to pay
 what its worth.
  &gt;&gt;
which exact part do you need?    I had previously posted some parts w/numbers 
and the chassis numbers they were used on.
