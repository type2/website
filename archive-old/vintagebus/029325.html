Hi Steve,
 I believe my speedometer is fairly accurate. I went by a couple of
the hiway &quot;Your Speed Is&quot; signs that sit by the side of the road. I read
57-58 and the sign said 57. I expect the same accuracy from the
odometer.
My motor is a 1200cc bug motor w/P&amp;c's to make it about 1400cc's. Pic 28
carb, original dizzy and bugpack muffler. Close to original 205x14&quot;
tires. As
far as speed goes I had the advantage of no headwind as we crossed
Northern Mo. It was more of a quartering or tail wind. Hiway 36 is not
flat by any means but it is not huge hills. I had never traveled in the
bus, the motor had about 600-700 miles on it when I left Omaha so I took
it easy. On the flats 55-60 tops and 50 up hills. On the return trip I
was running a bit faster, 60-63 to keep up with NQ and Robert Laffoon.
They could easily have outrun me but we were a team and stuck togeather.
I swear every mile the motor felt stronger and happier. I recorded all
my mileage on the inside of my windscreen and after the 3rd fill up I
also recorded the fuel purchased. Most fills were at about 140-150 miles
and 4.5 to 5.5 gallons. If I had not refueled several times I would have
suspected short fills, but every tankful seemed to get better. I also
only used regular gas not ethanol blend even though the octane rating
was lower. She seemed to run a little stronger.
I wish I had recorded the gallons purchased for the first couple of
tanks cause even though I ran the numbers then the weekend is a blur
right now.
Dick Bozarth of Omaha built me a fine motor and for that I am most
grateful.

&gt; Ok Terry,
&gt; 
&gt; I need to know the details here.  How do you drive on the freeway?  What
&gt; speed (and is your speedo correct)?
&gt; 
&gt; I have a 1600 dual port and my 67 westy gets 18MPG on long highway trips.  I
&gt; drive at 68 to 70MPH... so I know that hurts, but I've also slowed down to
&gt; 60 for 1 tank and saw little improvement (maybe 19MPG).  I've also run stock
&gt; carb and now Dual Kadrons (known for good MPG)... and almost exact same
&gt; usage.
&gt; 
&gt; Seeing someone who gets 28MPG with a 65 Westy... I know I must be doing
&gt; something different.  Not like I slow down and accelerate a lot on the
&gt; freeway... I just go a steady speed (wind and hills permitting).
&gt; 
&gt; Is this very flat land?  Windy conditions?  Tires you use?  Transaxle?
&gt; Whatever you can tell me.
