Subject: Re: [VB] Underdash gas heater question

My understanding is the underdash models were meant for Trucks since there
was no way to run the ducting front to rear without losing space in the
treasure chest as you would have to do if you ran the rear mounted style.

&gt; I have one of these heaters in my 65 Kombi....   and this past summer I
did
&gt; about 13000 miles from July untill about end of October- mid November...
&gt; many miles were with a friend of mine who is about 6'...   he didn't
&gt; complain about lack of leg room...
