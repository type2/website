&gt;perhaps a lifter is hitting something; or while the pushrods are not
&gt;FLEXING as bad as EX #1 once did, but still one is not right in the
&gt;lifter cup, and is rattling around.

Goofy idea: pushrod too short, therefore rattling around between the
rocker arm and lifter?

&gt;if i take the pushrods off of each cylinder in turn, the noise should
&gt;go away IF the pushrods are the problem (do i pull the sparkplug on
&gt;that cylinder for this test, or just the wire)?

Just pulling the wire will be quieter (easier to determine noise) but
it seems like it would also load the engine a bit more, working against
a closed-up cylinder.
