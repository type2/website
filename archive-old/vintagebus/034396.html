This is not relevant to short term savings but
I thought I would mention a wheel cylinder
option - particularly as they will become rarer
and go up in price (probably more of a problem
in Aus rather than the US at the moment).

It is possible to have your cylinders sleeved
with a stainless steel insert.  Here in Aus the cost
is equivalent to that of a 'new' brazilian cylinder but
a marine grade stainless steel sleeved cylinder will 
last for many many years, irrespective of the amount
of use it gets.  At the same time you can set the cylinder
up to use more readily available rubber bits ...

I bought new brazilian cylinders for one of my buses
some 12 months ago.  The bus hasn't been used much
and I 'went through' the brakes to clean and check - I
was dumbfounded by the amount of pitting that had
occurred in these components in this relatively short time
- they were junk.  

Stainless steel sleeves for me (and rebuilds in the future)
long before I'd spend  money on more new Brazilian cylinders!

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;kits for these things? What is the part number if so, and where can I get
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;these if I need them? Just a few questions I know somebody else is
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;wondering about too.

&gt; t, another friend got some rebuild kits
&gt; for his 51 split window bug from them too, he was the one who told me to
&gt; check
&gt; them out.
