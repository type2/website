Help!

Does anyone know of a source to purchase spot weld cutting bits?  I know
that they exist, because I've been using one to take apart a cargo
floor.  For the life of me though, no one seems to carry them near me.
Most people say that there is no such thing, let alone replacement
bits.  BTW this is the type of cutter that looks like a mini hole saw
with a spring loaded retractable pin in the center.  You use it with a
hand held drill motor.

I picked up the one I have from some no name tool importer (ala Harbor
Freight), but now can't find them any more.  Can't believe what A-holes
some of these tool houses are around here (O.C.).  If the brain surgeon
at the counter hasn't ever seen one before, than in his mind it doesn't
exist.

 I'm in the L.A.  Thanks for any help.

Steve
