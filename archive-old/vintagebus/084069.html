&gt; Hi Mark,
&gt; We just wanted to mention that info would be for the bug.  The  bus here in 
&gt; N. America used the 1500cc from 1964 still used the return  spring on the 
&gt; accelerator cable till engine # H 0 085 360.

Hello Eric&amp; Barb  How ya doing? well I hope. Yes that is right that was done 
on the bugs . I think the first year for buses was around 1966 . At least my 
66 OE hardtop westy with the governor came that way. later  Mark Dearing
