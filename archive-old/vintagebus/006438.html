this months (nov) volksworld has an article on julian hunt's '52 panel resto

well worth the price just for that.

tho you might still be shocked at the work shipped out.... (bit of a half
self/half trailered out)  but isn't it better *sometimes* for somethings to
be done by a competant person?

oh,  and there's sort of a mention of thom's wiring diagrams in there being
the source for solving his wiring mare....   doesn't give it name tho.

Glynn...  54 camper- doing it himself -- but taking soooo long about it.
