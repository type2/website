I have two elephant ear side view mirrors just waiting to be installed on my

66' bus, however, the pins that are currently in the hinges are completely

rusted in.  I have attempted to knock them out but no luck.  Instead, I have

decided that my best bet it to find a set of hinges for both front doors and

simply swap them out with the existing ones.  Any idea on where I can find

these?  I have checked with WCM and other after market shops but they don't

seem to be in production.  If anyone has a good pair of hinges, I am

interested.  Thanks.

When I got my 61 it had no side view mirrors.  My boyfriend at the time found
this annoying and drilled out the drivers side round topped pin to put an
elephant ear on it.    Some years later, the door gets munched, and I replace
the drivers door, now it has a broken off mirror arm there, which ould not
budge with normal mean (penetrating oil, vice grips, rubber mallets etc)  .
So I drilled that out carefully to try not to round out the pin hole.
Switched the mirror over.    Easier than switching hinges.
