hey,
yesterday i removed and replaced one of my headlights and later when i 
turned on the parking lights the switch began to smoke. P U ! didnt get a 
chance to look at it while painting, but could the hot parking light wire be 
grounding on the inside of the bucket? anyone ever have this happen? ill 
check it out later.
thanks!!
