Subject: Re: [VB] Stainless Metric Hardware
Cc: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

&gt;&gt; I wasn't asking about the 8.8.  I was asking about the grades which the
&gt;&gt; metric stainless bolts come in, and which of those is comparable to the
&gt;8.8
&gt;&gt; often used by VW.  At Fastenal, metric 8mm bolts come in '18-8' and '316'.
&gt;&gt; Do you know what these numbers mean?  It's hard to tell which number is
&gt;&gt; &quot;higher&quot;, since they seem to be from two different rating systems.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Unfortunately, for the most part stainless steel fasteners are not available
&gt;in high strength grades. 18-8 and 316 refer to the stainless steel
&gt;composition and only describe the corrosion resistance. 18-8 is the basic
&gt;designation for 300 series stainless, roughly the same as 302. It has good
&gt;corrosion resistance under normal conditions. Tensile strength of these
&gt;fasteners is about 100,000 psi, slightly less than an SAE grade 5 alloy bolt
&gt;(medium strength). 316 stainless has a higher corrosion resistance, it is
&gt;intended for applications with exposure to organic acids, specifically
&gt;hydrochloric acid. The strength characteristics are the same. It is possible
&gt;to find stainless fasteners in the 400 series, which can be hardened for
&gt;higher strength, but the corrosion resistance is lower as well as the
&gt;availability. The price would  make your jaw drop. In short, use plated SAE
&gt;Grade 8 fasteners where strength is an issue, otherwise, 18-8 stainless
&gt;steel will serve for other situations. Be sure to use some anti-seize
&gt;compound when you put them in to keep them from galling and seizing. Use
&gt;copper or brass nuts on the exhaust system. HTH

OK, now we're getting somewhere.  Kudos Craig for the stainless info, but
my original question remains unanswered:

How does the strength of the stainless hardware compare to the 8.8 which is
often found on VWs?  Is there a conversion from the SAE grades to the
European system (which is where the 8.8 comes from, I'm assuming)?

Oh, here's another question for the stainless guys:  When stainless
corrodes, what does the corrosion look like?  I know copper corrosion is
green, iron makes rust (we all know so well), aluminum makes the whitish
aluminum oxide (very abrasive - that's why distributor caps with aluminum
terminals inside are to be avoided), but what does stainless oxidation look
like?

TIA,

Kabayo
