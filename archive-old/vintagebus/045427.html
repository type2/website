&lt;&lt; Ok, here's what I think.  I've seen a shorty split bus, bay window bus,
 double cab, and now single cab.  Please, anyone that wants to do this to

 that they dri &gt;&gt;
For anyone who likes em, I have a 56 singlecab project about as long as the 
red duracell truck. $400 buys it. batteries not included.
