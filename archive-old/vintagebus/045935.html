First I think you have to divide SOTO up , the Jeff Walters years and after

If it was not for Jeff there would never have been a bus club this big, or 
coverage of buses in Hot VW like there is today.

Jeff put alot of time and effort into the club, the news letters were great, 
not a folded single sheet.......

the shows were fun, the best one had 450+ buses

Soto made buses popular.....

Then there is the Dave years.......................

and my mother said if you cannot say something nice, don't say anything at all
