Well, I guess it wasn't much of a &quot;trip&quot; per say, since we only had to drive 
about 30 minutes from home to get to both OCTO and the Classic, but we had a 
great time nonetheless.  OCTO was it's usual plethora of reasonably priced 
parts, and Matt and I got a few things we needed for the new 65 Sundial.  We 
also found Axle (sp?) from Germany, who had more NOS parts in boxes than I've 
ever seen at one swap space.  While others were throwing out hundreds (even 
thousands for a few) of dollars, we spent a meager $35 and got a brand new 
German front hood seal for the notchback.  We always manage to find type 3 
parts at the bus shows....
After OCTO it was over to the brewery for some beer with fellow listees.  We 
met Harry, who bought the first round, Craig, Chuck (who informed us he's 
only been on the list for a couple of months and changes his screen name so 
we can't keep track of him...lol), and Karl from the Type2_dot_com list.  We 
chatted for a while and then Richard (rustybus) and Jim and Paula Ellis 
showed up.  We ate, drank, and were merry, and then Richard asked Matt and I 
to navigate for him in the Gene Berg Rally.  We had planned on going to the 
toy and literature show, but decided that the rally sounded much more fun, 
especially in the rusty bus. 
It must have been quite a site seeing a multicolored, super rusty bus with a 
light-up neon VW emblem on the front coming toward you with Matt standing up 
out of the ragtop looking for clues.  : )  Anyway, we had a blast on the 
rally and only had to double back a few times to find things we completely 
missed.  We stuck around at the restaurant the rally ends at until about 
10:00 PM, and boy are we glad we did, because we came in 2nd place!!  We got 
a really cool plaque with a Berg shifter knob on it.  
The next day we headed out to the Classic, and, as promised, we were the only 
late model notchback there.  We spent most of the day wandering around the 
swap meet looking for the elusive Sundial camper windows that crank open and 
have the single pane of glass (not jalousies) that fit the stock window 
openings (not panel openings), but it was futile.  We did get a few leads on 
people who may have a set, but nothing too promising.  So....if you or 
someone you know have a set, let us know.  We left the Classic around 2:00 
and headed back home to Torrance.  
All in all it was a supah-dupah weekend, and meeting listees we usually don't 
see around here was really great.  It's nice to be able to put faces with 
names.  
Ok, that's it, I'm done.  Off to Home Depot to find bolts for the new roof 
rack clamps we got this weekend.  : )
