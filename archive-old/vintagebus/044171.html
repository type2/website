&gt;&gt;what is everybodys 
opinion on trying to sell it on ebay?&lt;&lt;

Matt,
I just parted out a bus and sold alot of stuff on ebay and It went great!!  I think selling bus parts, you're obviously going to be dealing with &quot;bus People&quot; and I have found most bius people to be honest, friendly, and &quot;straight-up&quot; so to speak.  This is probably why it was so positive for me (made a good deal of $$ too!).  If your selling to the population at large different items,WHO KNOWS WHAT YOU'LL GET!  But with the VW folks, they are almost ALWAYS a pleasure to deal with!


Peace, John Baker
