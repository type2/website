Subject: Re: [VB] Got my birth certs! time to start cutting in the walkthru


 Interesting to note that
&gt; nowhere do they refer to
&gt; 'dove blue' or duvblau, they only call it
&gt; 'Taubenblau' (the whole list is
&gt; all in german btw). yet on my birth certificate they
&gt; call it dove blue.
&gt; 


I have also heard it refered to as Pigeon Blue.
 Mike
