I see a LOT of stuff advertised on ebay as being barndoor that is NOT.
Barndoor is one of those magic words that people search for, like
&quot;NOS&quot; and &quot;Empi&quot;, and cojures up dollar signs in people's eyes.

Furthermore, there is widespread misinformation about what really is &quot;barndoor&quot; - people need to learn the difference between &quot;barndoor,&quot; &quot;wolfsburg&quot;
and &quot;hannover&quot; buses.  There's also &quot;European&quot; parts which go up
to '60 or '61 (I think it's '61 upon futher reflection, to
coincide with the end of semaphores)

To me, a &quot;barndoor&quot; part is a barndoor-body specific part.  Ie 
&quot;barndoor&quot; engine lid, apron, pedals, dash, windshields, switches,
taillights, front beam, transxaxle, front seat, steering components,
and probably a couple others I missed.  These pieces will ONLY fit
a REAL barndoor. Spare tire tray.  Gas tank.   Bck seat top half.

Even the early barndoor-era pickups and ambulances had an engine lid 
which was significantly different than the later, non-barndoor style.

A *wolfsburg* part is in a set that *includes* barndoors and early '56.
Examples of this are bakelite dome lights and six-leg middle seats.

*European* parts consist of such diverse elements as semaphores and
symmetrical bulb headlights.  These went to '61 on euro-spec buses,
yet are *constantly* being touted as barndoor.  Ribbed semaphores
are 53 and earlier barndoor and split bug.

Hannonver parts are just about everything else, mid-56 -&gt; 67

(I'm starting to go into RT mode here...)

Maybe I need to do a page outlining this stuff...

&gt; So not only was barnoor spelled incorrectly, the items

&gt; than NOS, it's restored&quot; they just plain lie?
&gt; 
&gt; I'd be pissed if I didn't know those weren't barndoor
&gt; headlights (pre-60's that is).  I guess the seller can
&gt; get out of it by saying &quot;Yeah, I said they were
&gt; 'bandoor' headlights, not 'barndoor' ones!&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; I learn more everyday from this list.  Thanks.
