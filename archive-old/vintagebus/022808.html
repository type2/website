Subject: &quot;Banjo&quot; (harp) mirror arms
Mime-Version: 1.0


I bought a set of repro &quot;banjo&quot; mirror arms, and they came in the mail
today.  I dunno why they camm them &quot;banjo&quot; when they look more like harps.
I bought them from Peninsula Automotive.  They look nice, although I've
never seen the originals in person, so I don't know how close they are.
Much better than the rusty crap that was on there, so I'm thankful for that
much.  

Anyone wanna buy a set of repro Elephant Ears?

I think I've snatched the &quot;Frankenstein&quot; title away from FrankieHill: repop
safaris, taillights and mirrors; patched cargo doors &amp; nose, home made
solid rear hatch...
