Hello all,

Yesterday, with not a lot to do, I headed out to the Pick-n-Pull (a do it
yourself junkyard) to see what there was to see.  I didn't get much, but I
did come across a windshield washer bottle with motor from a Mazda, which is
going to go in my '67 Kombi camper.....I don't like the looks and the parcel
tray space required for the stock squirters....not to mention the
price.....and this one will fit in the small, flat space I'll be making for
it in the passenger side kick panel.  I'll probably mount the switch under
the parcel tray.

Now for the question:  There is a 1971 Kombi with a complete upright
(probably 1600 dp) engine including air cooler, and although the tag by the
door sez 1971, it looks like a '68 or '69....the reverse lights are separate
from the taillights.....what's the deal with this?  Anyway.....here's the
question....should I buy the engine for about $130, rebuild it (it my or may
not need it...there was compression in all cylinders, but the whole thing
was covered with oil...I'd rebuild it anyway!)  and keep it as a spare for
my '67 Kombi, and possibly the '65 or '66 Deluxe I'm hoping to aquire??

Thanks, Gene
