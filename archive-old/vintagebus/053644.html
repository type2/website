Subject: Re: [VB] No GL-4 tranny fluid to be found.  Questions




&gt;Looked ALL over town and haven't been able to find any GL-4 &gt;Gear oil for my
transaxle.  Only thing I have been able to find is &gt;the multi-grade stuff GL-3
thru GL-6 and synthetic stuff for GL-&gt;5.  Will any of this work or do I have to
mail order some in?
&gt;  ....Anyone ever used Redline products?  Heard good things &gt;about them on the
water-cooled side.

Only GL 4. Stay away from anything that mentions anything else along with 4.
Stay away from 5.
Here is the Redline site:
http://www.redlineoil_dot_com/whyredline.htm
Scroll down to Product Application. Then down to MTL and MT90.
MTL is GL 4 in 70W80 weight.
MT90 is GL 4 in 75W90 weight.
