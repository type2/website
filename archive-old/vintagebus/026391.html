when bought new, the stereo system probably ran be about $2000, no idea
what it is worth now that it is 3 plus years old.  i also got to keep my
1.4:1 ratio rockers out of it too.  kept some other stuff from it too. 
i at least dont have to buy tunes for my next &quot;project&quot;.  i feel i did
alright.  best i could hope for.

unfortunatly, it doesnt look like the next project will be a bus right
now. my father is going to give me a great deal on his euro 59 bug with
ragtop and semaphores, 71 pan (for the irs), ghia disk brakes, set of
porsche alloys, full velour interior, filled dash with custom vdo gauge
set, two-tone paint (the love of that probably comes from my love of the
two tone bus's).  it needs an engine and a tranny, brakes gone through,
and minor stuff.  the deals too good to pass  up.  i'll be going big 
two liter in it for fun.

the bus gets picked up on sunday afternoon.  the new owner is going to
do to it, what i could not have done for quite a few years. it will
recieve a complete restoration (body and paint, mechanically, it was
new) then shipped off to his dealership in japan to sell.  like many of
you said, the people that would buy it over there are not going to be
young punk kids that will trash it, rather mature people that will buy
it as (do i use the word &quot;collectors item&quot;?) and treat it with great
care.  i drive rush hour everyday, 33 miles round trip, and part of me
wonders how soon my luck would run out, and i would get hit by someone. 
the traffic is horrible in this town (las vegas), and it would be a
matter of time before my number was up.  its going to a safer place (i
hope), or at least i keep telling myself that. :I

  my hearts going to break, but this will give me the chance to put some
money towards credit cards. soon as those are paid off, i can afford to
buy another bus, and start doing a good restoration on it.  this bus was
my daily driver, and i couldnt park it to do serious body work, i didnt
really have the money to buy all new rubber for it, i could keep it
mechanically well, but that's about it.  

i will get another bus, i just have to wait until i can afford to park
one in the garage, and really take my time with it, and make it as nice
as i want to make it.  no rush to get certain parts in desperate
measures to get it running.  a total restoration.  thats what i want to
do.  i cant do that unless i have spare money coming in, and the ability
to park the bus for long periods of time without having to drive it.

i would still love to come to busses by the bridge, if i can come, even
if i dont drive a bus there.  can i come guys?  i still want to be
active in the bus scene, i just wont be able to &quot;participate&quot; as well as
i would like to right now.

i love buses.

66 Westy (until sunday)
