Ah, wondered if anyone read that.  It reflects the cynic in me (1%), and my
like of percentages.  Don't know how long I'll keep that going.  I bought my
bus in Honolulu when I was living there.  Not much to choose from as far as
jewels in the ruff.  Didn't know what I was in for...

Now, 18 months later, I've replaced the driver's side window section metal ,
beltline to roof, and passenger side, with donor metal (thanks Ronnie),
driver's floor pan, inside rocker, left side cargo floor, outriggers, parts
of the cross beams, etc with new metal, the lower front with new metal and
donor from a '66 I found here in rustville, and the lower ends of all the
posts (thanks Kelly).  And of course there was previous hack work.  (not to
be confused with my hack work.)  I wonder what I bought sometimes- a
pattern?  Its all fun though.  I figure that when I'm done, I'll be around
50%.  Not bad considering what it looks like Kelly's had to do to fix some of
those buses!  Just sometimes wish I had started this on a 23-window or
Westy.  But then maybe that will be my next project...  But as I'm moving
back to Hawaii in October, I'll have to come back to the mainland fo find
that one!

&gt; So if it's 57% '65 Micro, what is the other 43%?  Air,
&gt; different year, Deluxe, rust???
&gt;
&gt; It's amusing to see that each time you post, the
&gt; percentage changes.
