&gt;  Hi Bill,
&gt;  It does sound like you have a M215 option 1963ish only rear axle.  Which is a
&gt;  little longer than the 1955-63 lower axle, so requires a spacer under the
&gt;  axle nut to use the earlier brake drum.  If you do not have the same axles on
&gt;  both sides this will most likely mean you will have differant gearing in each
&gt;  reduction box.  This can lead to over time damage to the ring &amp; pinion.
&gt;   &gt;&gt;
&gt; that's interesting.   did the 63 optional 1 ton get 1.26 reductions?   Or did
&gt; it have 1.39 reductions like the 55-63s?   Remember Moselle the 61 standard?
&gt; It had one (1) 63 only M 215 stub axle, with the 55-63 brake drum and thick
&gt; washers to take up the space.
&gt; 
&gt; so, gearing...
&gt; 
&gt; yes, the regular geared 63s would have upper gear w/ 18 teeth, lower with 25
&gt; 25/18=1.388889
&gt; 
&gt; m 215 63 would have differnt upper gear, w/ 19 teeth, and the lower  on that
&gt; special stub axle  would have 24.   this is the same gearing as the 64-67s.
&gt; 24/19=1.263158
&gt; 
&gt;   yup.  kinda funky to mismatch them.  Of course, you want to rush out and
&gt; play reduction box this weekend right?  But have you changed your gear oil
&gt; lately?


Well you were both right!

The boxes are torn down and the SC has one m215 axle, ~3/8 inch longer with
24 teeth. it was mismatched to a 18 tooth drive gear. So if it was ever run
this way it must have been noisy.

The boxes were clean with new oil and the bearings are in very good shape. I
don't think that it was ever run since it became a project for 2 or 3 DPO's
back. 

There is a mish-mash of spacers, washers and &quot;O&quot; rings. I will be ordering
the rebuild kit with seals, washers and gaskets as soon as I can get into the
BD site. Thanks for the stash announcement today, RON! As soon as the
replacement Axle and kits arrive I will get them reassembled. Not that I
don't have anything else to do.

Thanks for all the Help!

Bill
