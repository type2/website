&gt;&gt;   1) Is the ONLY place that the heater boxes exit heat the two vents below
the windshields?  Are there no ports in the back seats or on the floor
in
the front? &lt;&lt;

Stephen,

On the wall that separates the front seat from the rear there is an
outlet for the back seats.  Just above the floor, there is a curved
inset area that goes in about 3&quot; or so and runs the width of the bus. 
On the passenger side of that inset area there is a bracket about 2&quot;
wide that covers the inset from top to bottom.  If you look behind that
bracket, you will see a small hole about 1&quot; in diameter which comes
directly from the heater tube under the crewcab.

Also, I seem to remember reading that the crewcabs had heaters mounted
in the engine compartment with two holes in the metal for combustion air
and exhaust air.

Finally,  Jeff in Long Beach has that gas heater that is still in its
original box that he is selling with his crewcab.  It might be worth a
call to him to see if he'd part with his heater.  Besides, there is much
more need for the heater in your area than down here (unless you don't
have heater boxes, like me).
