Subject: fuel tank sender

I am pretty sure my fuel tank sender is bad. I just hooked up a spare
fuel guage I had laying around and it still says that I have a half a
tank when it is full. Do I have to pull the tank to replace the sender.
I was told by one parts place that I had to, another said I didn't, and
a third didn't know. I need to pull the engine to change the throwout
bearing, and I figured this would be the best time to do it, but the
tank is full. There is about another 20 things busted on the bus right
now, so I can't drive the gas right now. Bumming a ride stinks.
