&gt; Well that is good to know because I was thinking of putting up a 3 car garage (polebarn) at our place near Spring Green,  WI.  The metal barn seems to be the fastest and most econimal to build, especially on a larger scale.  A 20'x20' (2 car) wood garage costs about $7k to build in Chicago, but I am sure that would be less in WI.  Any suggestions on any good prefab non-metal ones to store and work on buses?

&gt; The problem is here in the midwest, with high humidity and cool nights the
&gt; inside of the metal barns will &quot;sweat&quot;. Even my metal carport this morning
&gt; was dripping from the underside. Compound the problem if the barn or
&gt; storage unit has a concrete floor that also will get damp and retain
&gt; moisture.

The culprit isn't the metal, it's the lack of insulation.  The roof is
exposed to the low temperature of the sky, so it radiates heat and lowers
its temperature below the dew point, causing water to condense out of the
air inside the roof.

The solution is to:

1. insulate the roof.  an insulating coating on the outside would be best.
2. Paint the roof white.  White surfaces radiate least.
3. put a dehumidfier inside the space, if it is well-sealed.
