Subject: Adjustable Beam and interchangability?
Date: Tue, 28 Mar 2000 22:15:47 -0600
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Last September, I purchased a brand new adjustable front beam from a guy for
dirt cheap (he did it as a favour to me to help me with the bus project).
This thing is so new, it still has the paint and a couple stickers on it
still.  Since I've secured my grandfather's shop starting tomorrow (YEEHAW!)
evening, I jacked up the bus and got underneath it just to see what I'm
going to have to do to remove the beam.  Then I noticed a subtle difference.
The adjustable beam I have has a plate welded between the upper and lower
torsion tubes.  It's got a large hole with 4 evenly spaced smaller holes
around it.  I'm pretty sure this is a beam for a baywindow bus because this
is the bolt up for the MC/powerbooster setup.

From past reading, I've read that a baywindow beam will bolt up to a splitty
with the only problem being the wheels sitting out another what is it - 1/2
inch, inch, or inch and half from where they currently are at.  I also think
that plate where the MC bolts up on a baywindow will have to be ground out
to allow the clutch cable freedom of movement.

I got this beam cheap and I'm really tempted to use it since it is in such
nice condition and the fact that it's adjustable means I don't have to be
riding around with the front end up in the air - I can certainly turn that
sucker down to where it needs to be.  My biggest concern is this width
thing - does it cause the bus to look like a goon-wagen?  Will narrow tires
counter that problem or will offset rims be needed to make the bus look not
necessarily correct - just better?  Does anyone have pictures of a splitty
bus with a baywindow beam on the front so I can see how the width affects
the look?

One more note - I don't have to use this beam but it would sure be nice
because I've been told now by several people that lowering the front end of
a bus just a little bit helps with the stability at highway speeds.  Since
I'm going to be putting a 1776 and freeway flier in this bus eventually, I'm
sure I'll enjoy having an adjustable beam.  I'm pretty sure the swingarm on
my current beam in the 1967 is in good shape and if it isn't, well it sure
can be rebuilt while the beam is out of the bus.

Thanks a ton for the input on this.  I open to any and all suggestions...
