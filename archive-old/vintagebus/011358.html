Hi everyone, 
I am Jamie Auch's wife.

He went to Litchfield, made it 800 miles and broke down in Cape May
Courthouse, South Jersey.

HELP!

He's got the '60 Panel Van/Bus.  HE ran rough once, stopped roadside, had
help replacing the points and then was driving fine to 3200 RPM and then
the tachometer started bouncing and Sparky died.
Towed him to Cape May Point,and his parents' house late Sunday night-
Replaced points a 2nd time, started right away, drove a few hundred yards
and died again.

Can anyone help identify trouble/locate a trustable VW expert...help in any
way?
I'll check back tonight around 10 p.m. or you can call Jamie at his
parents' house at Cape May Point
609-898-9753

Please don't call after 10:30 Eastern time

We're trying to get him back to Virginia to begin teaching again for the
summer school Wednesday-
Thanks for your help

Christina Auch
