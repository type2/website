&gt;
&gt; One thing I did was a &quot;Poor Man's Compression Test&quot;: pulling each
&gt; spark plug wire out of the dizzy cap to see if the RPM changes, i.e.
&gt; see if that cylinder is firing.  When I did this, there was no
&gt; noticable change on cyls #2 and #4, making me think that they
&gt; weren't firing properly.

Some random thoughts...

This would make more sense to me if #3/#4 or #1/#2 were broken (left or
right half of the engine) rather than #2 and #4 (*back* half of the
engine).  Uh, not to teach my grandmother how to suck eggs or anything,
but if you're standing behind the Bus, #1 is the front (FRONT) right, #2
is the rear right, #3 is the front left, and #4 is the back left.

Is the mixture different for the back half of the engine?  The usual
suspects for a left side/right side difference would be one of two carbs
misadjusted (but you only have one) or a leaky dual-port intake manifold
boot (but you don't have those).  Beyond that I'd wonder if there is a
problem where the manifold seals to the head, or possibly a crack in the
intake manifold - either problem would allow extra air in and lean out
the mixture.  Maybe the manifold-to-head gaskets aren't quite right and
are blocking off the rear side of the intake port a little more than the
front, leading to reduced flow to the rear cylinders.  You might pull the
carb and manifold for inspection.

Another possible problem is that the air+fuel is getting into the
cylinders just fine, but can't get out for some reason, like the exhaust
is restricted - either something in the muffler/heater boxes or maybe a
bad gasket or connection where the flanges bolt on to the rear cylinders.
The simple (but noisy) test is to drop the heater boxes and muffler and
see if that improves things.
