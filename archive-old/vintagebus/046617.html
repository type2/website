&lt;&lt; when did the side view mirrors switch from the round type to the elephant
ear ones?&gt;&gt;
Hi Jeff,
They never did change.  It seems to be that the round mirror is the one that
would have come from the factory on the drivers side.

 I'd like to buy a original round driver's side mirror with the arm, I
believe that's correct for my '62.  The mirror that is currently on the
driver's side is an elephant ear one
 stamped VWOA on the back&gt;&gt;
Well you could buy the VOA (Stamped on the front not the back!) elephant ear
one at the dealership in the early 1960s.

 &lt;&lt;but I would guess It's not original, since there was a nice rectangular
truck mirror pop-riveted to the passenger side. &gt;&gt;
Is the upper hinge pin still in the passenger door?  If so the stock round or
dealership accessory mirror on that side was probably never installed.  So
later someone instead of taking the time and trouble to remove the upper
passenger hinge pin decided to mount the screw on aftermarket truck mirror.
