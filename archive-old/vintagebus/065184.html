&gt; The first thing you want to do is get all the rust out.   You can use a wire

&gt; there are holes you can stick something through, you should get a patch piece
&gt; and weld it in.   You'll find the metal is pretty thin around the rust hole.
&gt; I think repro pieces are made, but I have no experience with them.   If it is
&gt; the flat area, you can use a middle bar off a dead bus for patch pieces, but
&gt; usually any bus with good window ledges is restorable, so it's hard to find
&gt; that corner curve as a patch piece from german metal.   I've used spot filler
&gt; to fill in rust dimples to get a smooth sealing surface before painting.

I think Kelly repros the lower window sections.
