Subject: RE: [VB] door pocket rivets souce?

Hey Greg,

My mantra was never NOS.... 'original' yes.  There are actually very few
*NOS* parts on the double cab.  I'm opting to restore or refurbish
things, much more fun in the long run and you don't take that gigantic
hit when you finally install that nos goodie.  I'd much rather find a
good og '59 era part than to use nos  ... yup, I'm trying to think of
any nos parts.... ah yes, the vent wing rivets only because someone gave
two to me...  the one eyed duck (but restored bushing and screw), the
drivers side front kick panel is nos but needs work just from shelf
wear.  I may end up using some nos empi shocks if I cant find some used
'70, or '71 date stamped koni bus shocks to restore (remember this is a
period correct '72 hotrod).  The wheel cylinders and mc are nos ate
(current production) parts simply for safety as are the seals and window
rubbers.  Gosh, help me out here, I cant think of any other parts.  Oh
wait, the nos speedo but it's date stamped 1-60 which really makes this
may 59 truck a hack LOL.
