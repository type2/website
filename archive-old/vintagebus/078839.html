Subject: RE: [VB]gasoline etc

Hey Clara, I have a CRC and an Aldrich Chemical catalog that I use for
reference... always too cheap to spring for the merck index :-O   The
crc does have lots of tabular data about elemental and common substance
(water) info, so, maybe the merck index would have expansion
coefficients of expansion of neat compounds.... its been too many years
for me to recall and plus, even though I have a phd in chemistry, I
*hate* chemicals :-)  ... give me computers, physics, and math any day.
Chemistry is everywhere which is why it's so valuable to understand.

So, if you're planning on changing temperature or altitude quite a bit,
just don't fill up the ol' tank so much... and go read that solex manual
on vintagebus_dot_com and this whole thing will become crystal clear ;-)
