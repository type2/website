&gt; So tonight, I went out to the shop and proceeded to spend about 5 hours
&gt; assembling the bottom end.  I'm ready to put the case-halves together but
I
&gt; don't have a spool of silk thread.  I'll have to go pick up a spool

    silk thread? for what? i guess i must have missed something &lt;vbg&gt; if
it's for the distributor drive gear, there are better and easier ways to do
it.

&gt; this?  It would seem to me the sealing nuts would be the more leak-free
way
&gt; to go but then again, how can I argue with his 'hundreds of rebuilt
engines&quot;
&gt; vs. my 1?

    &quot;hundreds of rebuilt engines&quot; can be meaningless if the builder has been
doing it wrong the whole time... the rubber o-rings do the sealing inside
the case halves, so the metal side of the nut needs to be against the case
half for proper torque setting. lightly oil the o-rings when sliding 'em
down over the studs. this will help prevent pinching of the o-rings when you
put the case halves together.

    did you check to make sure the cam gear is the correct size? check to
see that the cam doesn't jump out of the case half when rotating the crank
in the opposite direction... there should also not be too much free play
between the two gears.

    after you have bolted the two case halves together, make sure the crank
rotates freely. it should turn very easily, if there is any binding you'll
have to find out why.
