Hey list,

Hope you all can help me out!  I'm trying to put new shocks on the front of 
my 66 deluxe and when I took off the old shock the race/hollow tube stayed 
on the steering knuckle (not sure what to call it the lower shock bolt) and 
the old shock now just has the delabitated rubber donut with no metal 
spacer.  Any Ideas on how to get this off.  I'm equiped with a phase I tool 
kit.  I'm gonna drench it with liquid wrench and try ye ol vice grips but I 
don't think they grab.  I'm hopin to get this resolved tonight I don't feel 
like the old shock is a safe way to go for now!

Thanks for any help

Eric
66deluxe
