Subject: Truck rear emblem Question

Ok, I have a question for you truck owners.  I was trying (in vain) to
mount the rear &quot;Volkswagen&quot; emblem above the engine lid on my '64 SC last
night.  After losing about 5 of the mounting washers in the &quot;black hole&quot;
which doubles as the crossmember/hinge carrier piece, I gave up.  Is there
some better way to attach this thing?  A 3 or 4 inch length piece of small
diameter vinyl tubing pressed over the pins perhaps?  I'm curious what
others have done...

Thanks,
