Subject: SPAM - Carbs

I'm cleaning out the parter Vanagon for its final journey and I came
across a handful of 'almost complete' carbs. A couple 34PICT3s, a 30/31
PICT (Borsal) and a 30PICT3.  By &quot;almost complete&quot; I mean that each of
them is missing something... Throttle arm here, fast idle cam there,
accelerator pump linkage on that one over there... Anyway, the throttle
shafts are reasonably tight on three of the four...  All of them are
dusty, but here in the PNW desert there ain't no corrosion.

Anybody want the pile for $25 and the cost of postage?

Jim
