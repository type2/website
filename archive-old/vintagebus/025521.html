Hey Chris,

I'm here, but  I had a no bus weekend! :-(((  [is that a long enough sad face?]

I had hope when I found out that my daughter's volleyball tournament was just
five minutes up the freeway at Fullerton JC.  Usually they play, have a 2 hr
break, play, 1 hr break, play, afternoon break.....  Anyway, the pools had
changed around and there were no morning breaks for me to slip away.  Got down
there at 1:30 in time to see the last of the buses pulling out of there.  I ran
into Kyle, Everett, Rich (rustybus) and Jim &amp; Paula Ellis and in the few minutes
I was there that's all she wrote.  I figured, OK, SOTO is next door to my house,
let me zap home quick and check them out.  They were going to have their raffle
at 2:30, maybe everyone is still there.  Same story.  Big line of buses pulling
out as I pulled in.  Just turned around and went home without bothering to get
out.

I went home and did a bunch of welding on the new exhaust system.  Finished it
up and put down a nice coating of POR-20 yesterday.

I tried...  but I guess it wasn't in the cards for me.

Thanks for asking.

Scott
