&lt;&lt; The '67 should have a 12 volt nose cone with the
 back up light switch &gt;&gt;
Hi Todd,
Only the latter half of 1967 bus production had the reverse lights.  So the
early half of this production year probably did not have the reverse switch in
the nose cone.  Have to agree if one does not know the bus's history first
hand anything could have been done to it internally.   Eric &amp; Barb
