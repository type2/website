Subject: Cam plugs and Rimco

I'm building a stocker 1600 with a brand new case.  I forgot to get a
cam plug when I ordered most of my stuff.  I looked at the case, and it
is not machined for a grooved cam plug.  Are the &quot;glue in ones&quot; good
enough?  Or, should I take it (the case) back to have the grove machined
into it so I can use the a cam plug for the &quot;groove&quot;?

Also, anyone in Southern CA have any recommendations for a machine shop
OTHER than Rimco (AKA Riddle Machine Co.)?  I've come to despise there
attitude toward the customer.  They act like they are doing me a favor
just by accepting my order!   If I can at all help it, I don't want to
give them any more business.  Anyone else have the same experience?

Thanks!

Steve
