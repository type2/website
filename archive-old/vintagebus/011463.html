&gt;Diana,
&gt;
&gt;Stop being so silly.  Fix your bus.
Hmmm, everyone else has been telling me I'm silly to try to drive this 
poor veedub. (those who have seen it) but I haven't listened yet...
&gt;You need the help of friends and chances are you have plenty of them 
out here
&gt;although you don't know it.  You need someone with a MIG welder and 
space to
&gt;work on a bus.  
Well Bob, I've needed all those things for about six months and I've 
been talking to everybody I know constantly about it.  All I've had so 
far are empty promises from people who say they can get access to a 
welder but never do.  I'm 23 years old and most of my friends can't even 
afford to buy a car, never mind a welder.  One of my dad's friends with 
an ARC welder is the closest I've come, but from what I hear that's a 
bad idea.  True?

&gt;You also need a couple of threaded steel barrels for the new
&gt;shock mounts (the lack of shocks is probably what lead to the 
structural
&gt;failure) and about one square foot of .050&quot; (or close to it) mild steel 
plate,
&gt;common stuff at any sheet-metal shop, welding shop, scrap metal yard, 

This all sounds way more costly and difficult than the repair I had 
envisioned, which I couldn't afford.  Other IRS converted busses I've 
seen had a new home-built shock mount which looked virtually identical 
to the stock one (albeit sloppier), just in a different place on the 
frame rail (which didn't seem to be reinforced). I don't even know what 
a threaded steel barrel is. 
I realize that the lack of shocks has been killing my bus, and six 
months of unsuccessfully trying to find a solution has just about worn 
me out.  The local VW bodyman just looked at my bus and told me not to 
bother, that the best thing to do would be to try to sell for about $500 
or less.  Another couple of shops wanted $300 for new mounts fabricated 
and welded on, bare minimum.  
I paid $500 for this bus (sans motor) because it's no beauty and that 
was all I could afford.  It's got two BIG dents (front and rear pass. 
side corners) about fifty smaller dents, rusted out rockers, no back 
bumper, broken front bumper, plywood back floor over the gaping holes, 
oven-rack patch on the front floor to keep passengers from falling 
through, bungee cord holding the driver's door closed, hole the size of 
a 10 CD changer where the stock radio grill would be, camper stuff from 
various '70s busses, no pop-top canvas, ugly driver's seat from an old 
porsche that I can't reach the shifter from if I lean back, ignition 
switch from a bug mounted to the parcel tray, lacks the correct axles, 
is guarded against bus-robbing junkies with padlocks attached to the 
doors, and cruises around town in three colours of tremclad paint, 
including a giant green Marijuana leaf which wraps around the bus from 
the rear passenger wheel to the front driver's window and an amazing 
array of deadhead stickers.  
That said, I LOVE my bus.  She is beautiful, she is what everybody sees, 
she strikes awe into the hearts of all my pothead friends and shelters 
me from the rain.  But my bank account balance hovers around the zero 
mark each month, although I have stubbornly persisted in paying $105 
each month just for insurance to keep her on the road.

&gt;Dismantle &amp; inspect your CV's before putting everything back together.  
If
&gt;you've been running without shocks you've probably ruined a lot more 
than the
&gt;swing-arm.
The CVs were toast before the shock problem, as the axles are wrong and 
there is a block between the CVs and the wheels, placing the CVs on a 
funny angle and wearing them out very quickly.  Thankfully, I do have 
access to cheap parts through a friend who has helped me out many times, 
so I just replaced the whole axle assemblies on both sides about 2 
months ago.  I've had those axles out about 5 times trying to fix them 
and I've only had this bus a year.

&gt;You broke your bus.  Now it's time to fix your bus.  Or go buy a 
Toyota.
This bus was broken when I got it.  It'll still be broken even if I fix 
this problem.  I'd like nothing better than to restore her and drive 
around a sweet, shiny '66 camper, to prove all those bus guys who told 
me my bus was was a POS wrong.  But unless I win the lottery it's never 
going to happen.  I don't want a toyota, I want a bus.  I want my bus.  
But sometimes the practical side of me has to win.  This might be one of 
those times.
I haven't totally given up.  It's not that simple to just decide to fix 
the problem while ignoring the simple reality that I don't have the 
skills or tools to do welding work.  I am not abandoning my bus.  I 
can't imagine giving it up, even though if I pull the motor out there 
will be virtually no useful parts left over.  Anyway, I don't see 
anybody else begging for the chance to own my butchered bus.  I am now 
overwhelmed with guilt, but I don't know what the final result will be.  
I guess I will do what I have to.  Most likely, the bus will sit while I 
try to find ANY solution, as NONE of my options seem realistic to me at 
this time.
Diana
