Hi...here is some Camper info...

[....]

&gt; I've figured out that my 56 is a camper not just a Kombi. All it has right now is the flip top, wood panels in the back, and the base something. What pieces am I missing?

There were 2 interiors available for this year Westy `56....the Standard
Camp box and the Deluxe Export...I won't get into specific details on
these and waste tons of bandwidth...you can pmail me for details...


&gt;  I've heard that even big window westy parts are the same is that true? 

Absolutely NOT...not even `64 and later interior pieces will fit
&quot;correctly&quot;


&gt; Does anyone have the measurments forthe pieces I need?

I just sold a `57 Deluxe Export that you might be able to get the new
owner to take measurments of...pmail me for his email address

 
&gt;I think it would be cheaper to make them than try to dig up a 56 westy interior.


Correct, they made only 1,000 westys from `51 to `59....estimate that to
about 100-200 produced each one of those early years...you can come
across a dozen or so barndoor deluxes before a barndoor westy...only 2
are currently known to exist....one in Florida and one in France...like
wise the early 50's era westy are also extremely rare.
