&gt; I think the Clear Lake show is on Father's Day, and is that June 16th.
&gt; If so does that match the Clear Lake show and is there a site to get
&gt; directions?

The Clearlake show is actually on the 22nd (Saturday) followed by a cruise
on Sunday. We have a bunch of people heading up Friday afternoon and are
setting up camp at the State park nearby so we can make a weekend of camping
out of it too.........
