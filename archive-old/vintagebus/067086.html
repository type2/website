&gt; The $20 question is, do I pull the trans back out for this?

Hi Thom,
No.  Just unbolt the RGB and swing it to the rear to clear the spring plate.  
Try using left hand drill bits if you have a reversable drill motor.  When 
drilling with these the torque of the drill will actually try to turn out the 
broken bolt.  Be very carefull of using easy outs, if you break those off 
there is no way to just drill them out.  In that situation you would have to 
visit your local dentist and beg/buy some diamond tipped bits to grind the 
bolt away from the easy out for hours till you can pry out the broken remains 
of it!
