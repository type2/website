&lt;&lt; Does anybody have a 15&quot; tire brand/model to recommend? &gt;&gt;
Hi Mario,
We just got a pair (See info below.) of these about two weeks ago and have 
installed them on the rear of our 1963 SC.  They have worked very well under 
heavy loads and do not produce the tire noise/whine that some of other tires 
we have previously tried.  We also had them swedged for more traction.  
Bought these from Discount Tires for a little over $100.00 each and they are 
warrentied for 40,000 miles on a much larger heavier vehicle which should 
mean they will last about 60,000 - 80,000 miles on a bus.  Eric&amp;Barb

ST 205/75R15  For Trailer Use Only  Load Range C
Max Load 826 KG (1820 LBS.)  At 345 KPA (50 PSI) Cold
Carlise Radial ST  Tubless  Made In USA
4 Plies Under Tread (2 Plies Polyester, 2 Plies Steel.)
Sidewall: 2 Plies Polyester.
They look to be about 26.5&quot; in diameter measure at the shoulders of the 
tread, the websight for this tire company lists them as 27&quot; diameter mounted. 
 The profile looks to be very flat sided so these probably will be very good 
for use in pre-1963 bus shorter and narrower rear wheel wells.  We will be 
checking this out on our 1960 panel bus sometime soon to see how they work on 
both the front and rear axles.  EEE&amp;B
