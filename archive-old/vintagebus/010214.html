Well boys and girls, I'll be heading to Omaha this evening in a couple of
hours for the Buskatiers campout around Gretna and then the show tomorrow.
Originally I had planned to stay all weekend but I've opted to come home
early to get the post holes drilled for my shed.  I'm sure there will be
pictures and posts about it with Terry Wolfe bringing his computer along.
I'll get to see how the bus really runs on the highway as well.

See you all when I get back.
