Green Montain VW Club
Sixth Annual All-VW Car Show and Swap Meet
September 13, 1998
Lamoille County Field Days Fairgrounds 
take Route 100C east from Johnson, Vermont toward North Hyde Park
Show-$10 Sell-$10 See-$4 (kids free)
info: VWSilver_at_pwshift_dot_com

AFAIK, this is the Green Montain VW Club's only scheduled public event. (ie. I
asked about joining the &quot;club&quot;, but they didn't need members).  Not a big VW
show, but it is only one in Vermont ALL YEAR LONG!  As this is my home state,
I am compelled to assure a splitty appearance.  Hope others can help out.
About 5 to 10 vendors and 30-40 vehicles last time I went 2 years ago.
Tourist Note:  IMHO peek leaf peeper season is usually 2 weeks later, after
the Autumnal Equinox.
