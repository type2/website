Well it was a busy and fun 2 days out in Colorado.  Kerry and I arrived home
around 6:30 this evening.  I met with and spoke with Clyde Berg and got
pictures of his drag bug.  I also saw Dee Berg and some of the family.
There was way too much to see and I missed out on more than I saw but I did
talk to some old pros and gathered information from them on hi-po VW stuff.
I learned a lot - even how to properly tune my Webers for better
performance!

Despite what people say about Gene Berg and his cocky attitude, I found
Clyde to be the most friendly Berg.  I had spent the weekend asking if
anyone had an AN-8 fitting that I need for my oil filter setup and it was to
no avail.  Finally late in the afternoon on Sunday at Bandimere, I spied an
old faded Ryder truck with some tents around it, California plates, with a
big Gene Berg sign hanging on it.  I didn't really pay any attention to who
was under it, assuming that Bergs would have elected to send representatives
on their behalf.  I walked up to a group of 4 guys and apologized for
interrupting them.  I explained my problem and that I needed a 90 degree
AN-8 fitting like what I had in my hand.  I was willing to buy a used one if
they had it.  This guy jumps up out of his lawn chair and climbs in the back
of the Ryder and drags out a beat up red tool box and starts rummaging
through it.  He's pulling out trays and looking around and I take the
opportunity to introduce myself then and he said, &quot;Nice to meet you Erin -
I'm Clyde Berg.  I about fell over backwards!  I asked him, &quot;THE Clyde
Berg?&quot;  Yep.  It was like I had met a celebrity.  I wanted an autograph but
succumed to the &quot;not worthy&quot; syndrome.  Anyway, he didn't have a fitting but
he asked if I needed it in order to get home.  I told him that it was for a
project at home but he seemed most willing to jump in and lend me if I
needed to hack something together.  We shot a the breeze briefly and then
went on to tell me about his mixture meter was reading lean on the drag
passes and when he put in larger jets, it still read lean.  He said
something like,. &quot;That bung is probably all plugged up giving me bad
readings.&quot;  I actually knew what he was talking about because I have the
same meter that I bought from them a couple of years back.  So here I was
talking racing stuff with Clyde.  That was an experience I'll treasure for a
long time.

I've got lots of photos and so did Rob so I'll see if we can combine efforts
and get this pix up for you all to look at.

Another highlight of the trip was meeting JP from New Mexico.  We hung out
at the Rainbow Falls campsite with the bus group and it was fun playing
guitar, singing, talking VW, and hanging out with the most die-hard VW bus
nuts you will ever meet.  I met a lot of cool bus people and hope to meet
them at the BNNTA event.

I've got lots of unpacking to do so I'll tell you all more later...
