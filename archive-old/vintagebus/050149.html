The bottom line is that there is ONE political party (and this is definitely a political problem) which believes in property rights - the Libertarian Party.  All of the other parties I know of are perfectly willing to abridge your rights for the sake of the collective.  The Republicans are total impostors and claim to stand for property rights, but have compromised and given ground to the Democrats on every issue for years, so that the Communist Party platform of the 1930s has now been implemented in every detail except for completely socialized medicine (though we are halfway there also).

If you want to live in an antiseptic neighborhood, fine!  That can be accomplished without government coercion.  All it takes is title covenants, which are agreed upon before purchase.  Everyone agrees.  No coercion.

When government gets involved, it uses what it always uses to accomplish its ends - force.  Deadly force if necessary.  And it changes the rules and forces them upon people who have owned their property for years.  And whose standards are then applied?  Those who find it worth their time to lobby and scheme and bribe to get their way imposed upon those of us who are just trying to live our lives in peace.

Is this democracy in action?  Yes.  But the U.S. was not created to be a democracy.  The founders knew that a democracy crushes the rights of the 49% or fewer who don't prevail in an election.  The members and supporters of the Nazi party in Germany were in the majority, to give an extreme example of what pure majoritarianism (democracy) can do.  Democracy is just a formalized version of mob rule.  Might makes right.  The U.S. Constitution, as it was originally written, called for a very limited government, and left few things to majority rule.  This protected minorities from majorities, and we are all in the minority on many of the positions we hold.

I'm rambling, and this could go on for pages and pages.  Sorry about that.  I'll try to get to my point.

I have a fundamental right to do anything I want with my own property, free of zoning laws, OSHA laws, drug laws, gun laws, or any of the other trappings of a police state.  I do not try to impose my views on others, forcing them to live by my version of morality, order, cleanliness, etc.  If you want to be a communist, you are free to start a commune when you live in a free country.  If I want to live as a free man in Klinton's Amerika, and I'm not secretive enough, I will wind up like those poor folks in Waco.  Free thinkers and especially those who live as if they are free are a threat to those who would rule every aspect of our lives, including fixing old VWs.  Al Gore wants to outlaw the automobile, and confiscate every car.  He wants us on mass transit, where we can be herded around and monitored by those who know better how to manage our time and energies for the good of all.

I know that most folks aren't very political, and don't see how owning a VW requires any political thought.  Well, a wise man once said &quot;The price of liberty is eternal vigilance&quot;, and this country has become over 50% socialist because that vigilance was not maintained.  The price was not paid.  It's a terrible shame that the sacrifices made by the Minutemen and others have been squandered as many of us have gradually surrendered our liberty, exchanging it for promises of security, promises which we depend upon known liars such as Clinton and Gore to keep.

Zoning laws and housing code are related to no-knock abductions of little immigrant boys in defiance of court rulings.  Related to members of Christian sects being burned alive.  Related to poor souls in foreign countries being blown to bits by unseen high altitude bombers on the eve of Clinton's grand jury testimony, or on the eve of his impeachment vote.  Related to a woman in a remote Idaho cabin being shot through the back by a government agent while holding her baby.  Related to a thousand other infringements on our liberty every day.

This isn't a political list, and I've refrained from getting involved in this thread until now, but if the moderator is going to condone a political discussion, I'm game.

Want to be free?  Follow the links in my sig line.  Your votes will help.  Over 2000 Libertarians are expected to run in this fall's elections, including a majority of congressional seats.  Putting up yard signs or displaying bumper stickers will help more.  Contributions will help even more.
