The latest I have heard is that VW is having real problems with
getting the correct look for the front end and still meeting
the front end impact crash tests.  You need the length of the
hood to have something to crumple to meet modern codes.   This
has been a major stumbling block for the retro style bus.

I don't think it will be a great hit, too many compromises to 
make it either look good enough for the 'style' conscious, and 
too little real function for the rest of us.

Another story I heard is that the next generation of bus will be
a front engine, rear drive version.  Also available in the states
as a truck, 4WD, and of course a camper.  If this story turns true,
I'll be first in line for one.  It sounds more like what the
split was, a utilitarian vehicle.  That's what I like about busses.

.....I received an email from a guy
from Business Week magazine a couple days ago wanting to ask questions
about our beloved micros. .....He told me VW is coming out with a New
Micro? He wanted to know what made the original so popular and what I
thought about a New bus coming out..... kinda cool..
