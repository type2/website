Subject: Re: [VB] Distributor Questions

On a long hill climb, during 100+ temps, my bus began
to get very hot. Had recently tuned it &amp; was certain
all was good there. What I didn't suspect was a broken
dist, clamp,causing the dist to move &amp; throw timing
completely off. Couldn't see it was broken.
