I painted my case and cylinders black, in accordance with the teachings of
St. Bob of Hoover. Caught hell for it from my heathen friends, but that flat
black Rustoleum/thinner mix just looks cool. Does it work? I leave that to
the theorists. Does it look cool? The enlightened think so...

&gt; In reading up I ran into Bob Hoover's posts on painting the P&amp;C's, and I
&gt; certainly intend to do that, after washing them :-)  As I stare at it,
&gt; tho, I think of the posts I have read thru the years on heat transfer in
&gt; air cooled engines.  The gist of half a dozen posts I have read is that
&gt; the sump is a major cooling area on the air cooled engine.  I know that
&gt; the P&amp;C's is where most of the heat is generated, so getting rid of it at
&gt; the source is a good thing!  The other source tho, and the other sink for
&gt; its disposal, is the oil.  Especially the oil in the sump.  I am thinking
&gt; that painting the sump flat black would help disperse heat from the sump.
&gt; I see plusses and minuses with this tho, and would love any advice anyone
&gt; has to offer.  As I see it:

It is harder to disagree with St. Hoover than it is St. Muir, but I have
to put in my 2 cents.

It is proven that a black surface radiates better than a surface of
another color.  What is not proven is that a painted black surface will
radiate better.  The paint may provide enough of a insulating layer to
negate any radiation advantage.

I used to race motorcycles, and it was common practice to paint the
cylinders and heads black.  We never knew if it worked, but it looked cool
and made us feel racey when the competition had aluminum cylinders.  After
a while, the manufacturers caught on and started coloring the cylinders
and heads black, but by anodizing, not paint.  Anodizing is much thinner
than paint, so no insulation problem.  We felt vindicated by the factories
going to black engines, but that changed when Honda started painting their
engines red with no apparent heat problem!  Oh, well...

Keep in mind that the primary route of heat removal from the cylinders is
not radiation, but forced convection.  Convection doesn't care about the
color of the cylinders, only about the airflow and temperature difference
between the hot parts and the air.

Also, the cylinders are already colored pretty dark, if they are anything
like mine.  Painting them black won't make much difference in emissivity.

The sump might respond better to paint then the cylinders.  At least here
there is somewhere for the heat to radiate to without running into tin.

 &gt; &gt; Plus:
&gt; Better heat radiation from the sump area, lower oil temps.
&gt; Paint protects against corrosion and this case has some already.

Good points.  I'm not sure if the mag case can be anodized or not.  If so,
that would be the route to follow.  Anodizing can't insulate heat, resists
corrosion, and won't peel or flake.

&gt; Minus:
&gt; Greater temp differentials between different parts of the case, more
&gt; chance to crack the case.

There's already a fair difference between the parts of the case.  Picture
the temperature differences between the mains and the sump on a nice
January day in International Falls, MN!

Another minus is that it's difficult to make paint stick to the case.  My
ill-fated GEX engine was painted (badly) and the paint peeled from the
sump in strips.  You really need to properly strip, prime, and paint the
case to do the job right.  Don't forget to mask off the gasket and sealing
surfaces!
