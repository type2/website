I know this is not a beetle list so please dont chastise me for being off
topic here.  Besides, a lot of you bus guys have beetles as well I am sure.

I have too many cars so I want to sell my wifes '70 Beetle Cabrio.  The car
runs well and looks great from 50 feet (cheap paint job), but needs
restoration.  I will throw in floor pans, heater channels, convert
reinforcements and perhaps a Rottweiler.  (I cant do that really...I talked
my wife into selling the car now I cant give away her dog.  Wishful
thought...)  I will sell the car for $4200 obo.  I would love to trade for a
bus but the wife would have a fit.  I dont need 2 cars to restore as the
pickup will keep me busy enough and I like it better than the convertible
anyway.  Do I sound p-whipped here?

The only negative thing about early Typ2s so far is that I have a hard time
seeing stoplights.  I am 6'2&quot; and I sit so high that I find myself crouched
over the wheel all the time when i drive in the city just so i can see high
enough to catch the lights.  If I sit straight, the top of the windsheild is
at eye level.  Nothing I can do.  I will blame the truck if i get hunched
over as an old man.  Other than that , I love it.
