Subject: Re: [VB] Daily Driver Poll/Bus Sighting :p

Well, Lovey and I stopped driving the bus regularly because it's so gosh-darned slow, don't you know.  In fact I'm not sure when was the last time we took it off the 
trailer.  I DO loathe getting those little stones between the tire treads, and then of course there's the GHASTLY lubricant film that gets on the engine when one has 
run it.  And don't even talk to me about heat.

At night, though, sometimes I have the most disTURBing dreams in which my muscles grow to the extent they rip through my shirt, and I'm somehow in an altered 
state wherein I find that regular driving of the bus feels like a VIRTUE.  A VIRTUE, by God, do you hear that, Lovey?  A Howell saying that, good God.  In this 
dream I'm so convinced at my own rectitude that I SNEER at anyone who doesn't meet my virtuous standard, and by God THAT makes me feel like a Howell again, 
and I wake up.
