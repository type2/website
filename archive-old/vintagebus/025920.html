The Ronnie says:
&gt;An old timer once told me that the best way to revitalize rubber was to
soak it in Coca Cola, not Pepsi, but Coke, there is some ingredients in Coke
that will absorb in and soften the rubber back up
&gt;
Oooh, this doesn't sound like a good idea, for the following reasons:
1. Coke can generally be used as a cleaner, I suspect it would be
detrimental to the mat.
2. Although it is not generally publicized (witness the New Coke fiasco),
the recipe for Coca-Cola has changed at various times over the past 15
years.
3. You know how much Coke it would take to submerge a floor mat?  What a
waste of Coke!!!

I've always wanted to take one of those Coke vs. Pepsi challenges, anybody
who cannot tell the difference between the 2 products has some serious taste
gland problems.
