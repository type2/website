Subject: Re: [VB] fililing the tank

I've put that much in a couple of times. Usually, the bus sputters a few 
times as you pull into the station when you get that low. You probably 
had still had a teaspoon or two of gas in that tank. Why'd you stop for 
gas so early?

&gt;Anyway I managed to put 11.2 gallons in. I didn't know this
&gt;was possible. I was thinking the pumps were not calibrated correctly. Could
&gt;the hot weather affect those readings? I have the original tank, whichI
&gt;thought was 10 gallons. I could imagine putting in a little over 10...but
&gt;11.2?
&gt;
&gt;I don't want to give the gas station a hard time by calling an inspector-but
&gt;11.2 gallons seems like way too much.
