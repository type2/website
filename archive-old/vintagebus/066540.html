Subject: all explained

i now truly understand why i was meant to screw up my starter.

tonight i went out to run pick some stuff up in my '67 rusty squareback. on
my way home, while stopped at a traffic light-i got rear ended. quite
shocking. the guy was definitely drunk. i called the cops right away. when
they showed up, we noticed an empty beer can at the pedal cluster of the
car. the guy couldn't start his car again-because he was too drunk to
realize he left it in reverse. he blabbered on and on about his inability to
restart his car...never once apologizing for wrecking my car. the cops let
him off without a breathalyzer-just by testing the guys eyes. the cop got
quite offended when i questioned his determination that the guy had not been
drinking.

anyway i think my squareback which was in pretty rough shape now appears
totalled. i was hoping to be able to restore it enough to be able to drive
it this winter-to spare my bus from the winter salt.

the good news:if i had not screwed up my starter-i would have been driving
my bus tonight, and the guy would have rear ended it.
