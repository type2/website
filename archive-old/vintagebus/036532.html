&lt;&lt; The air cleaner is the same as 36 motors...maybe a differnt
 sticker on it but that is it.  I have pictures and original owners
 manual if you need proof. &gt;&gt;
Hi Todd,
The problem of using the owners manuals for exact info on the engine
especially right after a major change is that the bus pictured often was a
proto type for that model year or pictured before the particular part was
manufactured.  Remember that these owners manuals had to be made before the
bus was produced since they had to photograph, set up the owners manual and
have it printed,   Plus the added mess that VW wanted to save money so they
did not reshoot all of the photos used in each years manual and so used
photos of earlier engines.
  Definitely interesting to hear that the engine in your 1960 has the 36HP
style, but it could have been taken off during engine removal for clutch
replacement and mixed up at the shop with the earlier air cleaner.  Also when
was your 1960 westie actually manufactured?
   If you have that bus book from England that recently came out with lots of
wierd European campers shown.  There is a neat factory color drawing of a
Bastard 40HP engine.  You can tell it is a Bastard 40HP engine by the raised
areas of on the head tin where the #1&amp;2, plus #3&amp;4 are stamped in the sheet
metal is raised about 1/2&quot; like a bad set of shoulder pads in a good suit.
The air cleaner is the correct one for the Bastard 40HP engine and is not a
36HP aircleaner.  We will see if we can find more info on this later this
week.   Eric&amp;Barb
