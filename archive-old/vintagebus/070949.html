Subject: Door Panel Patterns??

Anyone have a set of door panels they'd be willing to make me some patterns
of?  A course I'll pay for the material shipping and whatever is a reasonable
fee.  Of the 2 other Splitwindows here locally neither have door panels on
them.  I'm getting close to needing to make some but have none to copy.
