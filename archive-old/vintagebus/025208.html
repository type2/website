&gt; Hi all. I have finally gotten some time and energy to work on Lucinda, my
&gt; poor suffering 67 Deluxe. I am stuck on the front inside brake lines. I
&gt; have some that are bent to approximate bendings, but they do not sit flat
&gt; on the backing plate and the springs rub against them. Can I drill two
&gt; small holes in the backing plate and run wire ties in to pull the brake
&gt; lines flat to the palte? Or is there another way to get them flat?
&gt;         TIA

Keep working on them...after a lot of work, they will sit where you want
them to.
One note of caution.... dont forget to leave room for the drum and seal
to sit flush against the backing plate. I know of at least three
occasions where folks have forgotten to do this, ( me being one) and
have pinched the line flat when setting the bearing play.
Next time you stip a bus out, or are at a junk yard with a severe parts
car, grab those lines for spares! I have several, and man do they come
in handy.  I wish I had had them when I did my last bendo-job.
