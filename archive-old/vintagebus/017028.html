Ted,
Thanks for the response, but this isn't the style of
shift  rods and couplers with the 2 set screws. On my
truck, the front, shorter shift rod fits over the rear
shift rod, and a short steel collar with one screw
goes over the joint.  My problem is that where the two
rods overlap, they fit so tight I (so far) can't pull
them apart.  The joint is less than 1&quot; from the heater
pipe (actually has rubbed on the insulation when
shifting), so there is not much space to work.
Thanks.

Jim
