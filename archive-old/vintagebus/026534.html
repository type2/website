Bosch is no longer rebuilding ( nor making new) the sr-17x &quot;automatic&quot;
starter, so this may not be an option for long.
Also, always keep in mind that although you dont need to match up the
correct bsuhing size, since the &quot;auto&quot; starter is self-supporting, it
will still ruin the flywheel of a 6-volt engine. The teeth on this
starter are still matched to the teeth on a 12-volt flywheel. I have
seen several 6-volt flywheels ruined when someone slammed in a sr-17x
starter. It worked for a while. Then it was a starter and flywheel
replacement problem.  The sr-17x is NOT a panacea.
