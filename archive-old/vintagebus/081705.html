Here's pictures of the accessory boat that fits on top of a bus:

Also for a short time VW actually made some real boats with inboard VW engines in them called the Volksliner.  Do a search for Volksliner on The Samba and you will find 6 pictures of one there.  For better pictures go to
http://www_dot_edu-television_dot_com/gallery/album21/aac and you can scroll through a series of 10 pictures in better light (being towed by a microbus too).

&gt; Have been offered a blue and white VW boat, fiberglass, fits on the roof
&gt; What are they worth ?

VW made boats? Or are you talking a high top like mine?
