Depending on your location this might be a alternative.  I have a old window
swamp cooler and you would not believe the cool air that comes out of it.

&gt; Thanks for the replies. I can figure out where/how to mount a compressor,
&gt; radiator etc. I am not sure where/how to install a heat exchanger, ducting
&gt; and all  the interior stuff so that I have cool air blowing around inside.
&gt; Any thoughts as to where to put the interior items? I am not too good at
the
&gt; aesthetic stuff. I have a kombi with the 1/3-2/3 seating up front. I would
&gt; like to have cooling both in the cab and in the back.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Chris
