Hi Andrew,
Interesting!  Which Bentley?  Our official VW 1960 through 1970 Without 
Guesswork for Type 1, 2 and 3 says 6 ft. lbs. for type 1 and 2.  For type 3 
it is 14 ft.lbs..
Thanks, Eric&amp;Barb

&lt;&lt; Bentley, Volkswagen Official Service Manual for Station Wagon/Bus 
1968-1979, 
 copyright 1979, 10th printing. &gt;&gt;
Hi Andrew,
Our copy is the 1978 printing.  Yup, it shows the torque _at_ 14 ft. lbs. on 
page 15 for the manifold to the heads.  Interestingly the 6mm bolts for the 
preheating pipe flanges are to be torqued to 1.0 mkg (7 ft. lbs.).
So is this a missprint since 14 ft.lbs. should only be used on the larger 
studs of dual port heads?  If you torque the sump studs so much you are most 
likely to break them off and since the 6mm head studs are the same material 
they are not going to be differant.  If you want, post these Pmails to the 
list and see what happens!   Thanks,   Eric&amp;Barb
