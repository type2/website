I was looking at a british website when I found a picture of a mass of buses
on the factory parking lot. None of the buses has overriders on the front
bumpers. Is the overrider a US safety option or what? Some of the buses in the
picture were deluxes so it was not a factory deluxe option.

the reason is that the overriders are not on my front bumper and the parts are
in the garage. Should I fix the overriders or leave them off.
