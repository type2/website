Subject: SP vs. DP... was:Re: HIPPY BUS, engine runs (my bad speleng)
References: &lt;199810240511.WAA30818_at_yiff.azaccess_dot_com&gt; &lt;199810240847.BAA06702_at_yiff.azaccess_dot_com&gt;

I dunno... but I'm pro-SP... It seems that every DP engine that I've
torn down has had cracked heads. The norm is that DP heads crack twice
as often as SP heads... and at close to $300/pair for new heads, plus
your labor/time involved in lapping the valves, matching the CC volumes,
and getting the valve stem heights equal, not to mention more articulate
headwork.... they are expensive items. 
	So you can save a little money by having them rebuilt or doing it
yourself... and since SP heads have a longer service life, your
investment is tangible for a longer period of time.
	Besides... I think that anything much larger than stock on a splitty is
overkill, since the redux boxes compensate for the smaller motors
inasmuch as they also limit top speed. I have had plenty of power with
the plain old 1600 cc motors, though they aren't stock-issue for my
splitties.
	I am currently running a SP 1600cc, stock cam, 6.6:1, 009'ed (30
degrees total advance), stock exhaust, 30 PICT-3 (?) on my '70 Westy...
and I am not really thrilled with it right now. Perhaps it is because I
built a DP 1641 mit der Kadrons, stock cam, and extractor for a friend
of mine for his '71, and miss the way that it ran and the power that it
made. I was hoping that mine would be a little more peppy than it is
now, but it isn't. Enlarging the main jet to a 132 size (i.e. #55 drill
bit) helped immensely, but it just isn't the same... though it does run
cooler and I have *some* more power on the interstate (50 to 55 now on
long inclines, 60 to 65 on the flatter areas).
	So... I do see your point about the restrictive SP heads... but I feel
that it is even more of an issue with the owners of the &quot;in-between&quot;
(68-71) breadloaves...??? maybe?, just my opinions... but I'd think
again about those DP heads if I were building the engine for my '70 over
again... that extra power would help out with the non-redux setup and
cruising at a safe and comfortable speed, IMHO.

&gt; Please ezcuse my ignorance, but what is the point in building such a
&gt; nice engine only to restrict the air flow by using single port heads?
