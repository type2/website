Subject: Re: [VB] Tire Report:  Yoko 370's

For the record, I run the Yokohama 356 tires (light truck tire) on my Kombi,
and with the exception of the one mounted on the bent torsion arm (my bad
:-P) the tread looks almost like new.  I have slightly less mileage on mine,
though, and 356 != 370 of course :-)

Handling is improved ridiculously much over the old passenger tires,
incidentally.

There sure seem to be a lot of issues with tires these days.  First
Firestone/Ford, now I've heard that Continental AG (who made the original
tires for old VWs if I'm not mistaken) is voluntarily recalling a model of
tire.  Turns out they were also OE supplied to Ford.  The feds are already
sniffing that one, too.
