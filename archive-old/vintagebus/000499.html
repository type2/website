 So further diagnostics: shorting across the big terminals on the (Ford)
 solenoid makes the (starter) solenoid clack with a satisfying sound.
 
 Shorting across the big terminals on the (starter) solenoid makes for
 showers of sparks but the starter does not spin.
 
 Starter is bad?

sounds like it.  BTW pulling the starter and bench testing it is okay as long 
as you put it in a tranny bell housing to support it.  Bench testing the 
automatic/self supporting starters bare is okay though.

did you cross the terminals on the starter itself though?   Do this w/ 
starter installed, unless you have a spare tranny/bell housing lying around.  
 Or put a thick jumper wire from the push on connector on starter, (you know, 
like wher ethe wire from the ig switch goes) push that into the engine 
compartment, and w/ bus in neutral, touch the jumper to the battery.   should 
spin, even w/ ignition off.
