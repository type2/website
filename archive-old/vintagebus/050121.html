Subject: Web Page Upgrades


The web &quot;reflectors&quot; for both lists are now searchable, making it easier to
find a message you remember but can't quite place. The web reflector
archives the 1000 most recent messages (for the sake of reference, that is
about one month's worth on vintagebus and two month's on type2).

There is also a link to Stephen G.'s uber-archive which has everything in
it back to 1994.

It's all kinda &quot;open-source-looking&quot; but it works and it's fast. Making it
un-buslike WRT two of those three criteria. =^ )

Unfortunately it is still possible for a message to be in *neither* archive
for some period of time, perhaps for a long time, because of the logistics
involved. We'll try to improve that situation.

As usual, David Raistrick took the time to make this possible so if you see
him you should buy him beer and give him a kiss on the nose.
