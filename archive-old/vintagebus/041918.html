&gt; During my 4 month honeymoon VW bus trip, I
&gt; didn't have a place to properly unload my
&gt; used oil, so I used the local Qwiki-Loob 
&gt; wherever I was.  I was a fun seeing people's
&gt; reactions in different places around the country.
&gt; I always provided them the tools, spread out
&gt; my floor mat, lay on the ground behind the
&gt; bus and gave them step by step directions.

When i start a 4000 mile summer trip, I pack 6 quarts of oil.  This is
enough for two oil changes.  The used oil goes back in the bottles and
goes along for the ride.  If I have a mishap that drains my oil, I'm not
going to be very picky about the fact that the oil I have already has 2000
miles on it!

The oil and drain pan live in the engine bay, opposite the battery.  With
a roll of paper towels, fresh gaskets, and a pair of latex gloves, I can
get through the oil and valves in about a half-hour with little cleanup.
The owner of the &quot;Cactus Motel&quot; in Thermopolis WY recognizes me each year
as &quot;the guy who's always working on his car.&quot;  What he doesn't know is
that
oil changes are about the only work I do on the road and that his concrete
parking lot is a particularly nice place to work, so I fudge the mileage a
couple of hundred miles one way or that other to do the work there.
