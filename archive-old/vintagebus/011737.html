I was recently going through the maintenance procedures, as in the idiots guide and have run into a few problems/questions.

I am working on a 1965 bus

As to the Transmission fluid change, I see two hex nuts on the bottom of the engine, I assume these are to drain the transmission fluid.  My question is where to put the new fluid in.  

Also while draining the oil, the pan was held on by a combination of acorn nuts(two of which were stripped leading to a real slow leak) and what I believe were bolts with 'acorn' type heads.  I thought that the engine should have had studs sticking out, that the acorn nuts screwed onto.  Is there some way to rectify this situation.  I think if I keep screwing these bolts in and out of the aluminum block I am looking for trouble(ie stripping).

Any suggestions appreciated.
