Owning a Splitty Bus in the words of  The Bus Guru--Micheal Steinke a
good friend of mine and co-author of the new &quot;The VW BUS the 1st 50
years&quot;    { ps- buy it!}
&quot;You can always do 3 things in a VW BUS,--eat--sleep and make love!!
with comfort!&quot;
While in California in 1960s,  I did those 3 things in an 58 MGA a
couple of times,  on the beach in Los Angeles--but not in all that
comfort!------uj
