&gt; Yes, the BG on top of the SWR, you can see it where the Beige Grey has worn
&gt; off in places on the roof.&gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; My 1965 Westy two tone was painted the same way.

My '65 Deluxe was also painted on the bottom first and then on top. I
have a lot of SWR showing where the BG has worn off on my roof. Maybe
they changed their minds at VW about how to paint a bus again sometime
after Clara's bus was painted. Maybe some of you '62 - '64 owners can
fill us in.
