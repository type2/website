I would guess that the Split Window size is a fluke that someone realized 
and cross-referenced after words. I say this because my '61single cab 
currently sports a 1984 Audi 4000 locking gas cap and before that it had a 
BMW 325i non-locking cap. I don't know if the Bay's use the same size or 
not, but if looks aren't important to you just start looking at all the gas 
caps in the bone yards (they charged me a whole dollar to get the BMW one 
when someone ripped-off my original cap at a gas station)

&gt;71 yet, but do plan to.  I dunno why but im guessing that they dont have
&gt;it.  But i would have guessed they didnt have one for the split either...
