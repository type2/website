almost free (notoriously inaccurate, of course!) junkyard VDO gauges to the 
fuse box of my 65 bus.  I go to pull a connector off the  back and the 
fitting comes apart - two pieces: one with tangs for the faston connectors, 
one with a tang for the fuse.  Looked like the two pieces were supposed to be 
 stuck together, so I went into the shop and plugged in the solder gun. &gt;&gt;

HI Joe,
For post-1960 fuse boxes the tang for holding the fuse and the tang for 
attaching the wire/s to just each side of each fuse are held together just by 
wedging these tangs in the fuse box at the factory!  Which allows corrosion 
between these tangs to cause voltage drops and heat at these points to occur. 
 This especially seems to happen to the far right fuse which is the main 
supply of electricity from the battery and generator/alternator to the 
starter up through the fuse box to everywhere else.  In our 63 SC the lower 
tangs of the far right fuse had heated up so much due to this flow of 
electicity and heat caused by corrosion between these tangs that the part of 
the fuse box that these tangs were pressed into had partly melted the fuse 
box body!  Causing these tangs to loosen and even more problems with 
conducting the electricity.  Once we found all this ut we have soldered the 
tangs in our post-1960 VW and have soldered the riveted parts of the pre-1961 
fuse boxes to prevent corrosion causing voltage drops in the fuse boxes.
