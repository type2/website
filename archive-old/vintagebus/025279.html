Rob and the list,
    Kudos to Diana and those who have helped and encouraged her in this journey.
I'm sure it will be one that she will remember and treasure the rest of her
life! About girls.....we have ten fingers, just like you guys....they work just
like yours...unfortunately, society has discouraged us from using them for
purposes other than the traditional &quot;girl&quot; tasks. With a little gumption and a
few tools, see what a girl can do? :-)  I know quite a few men who would not
even consider attempting what Diana has! I've done a fair amount of
wrench-spinning myself, but Diana is an inspiration. She has that &quot;just do it&quot;
spontaneity that many of us wish we had. She was even a topic at our club
meeting the other night.
    Diana, here's to good, safe travels and more of that rare gumption!  :-)

&gt; Hello volks!
&gt;
&gt; I had a visitor yesterday evening.  You may remember a girl named Diana from
&gt; Vancouver who was traveling down to Tennesee to pick up a bus and drive it
&gt; back.  Well several weeks ago she posted an itinerary for her return trip.
&gt; It sounded like she would be passing near Bartlesville (NE Oklahoma) so I
&gt; e-mailed her and told her if she got close and needed anything to give me a
&gt; call.  Well, she called while I was at church and my son told her to call
&gt; back in a little while (he didn't know anything about her).  She did, and I
&gt; told her to come on by.
&gt;
&gt; She is driving a '66 Westy that she got from a list member in eastern Tenn.
&gt; (sorry, can't remember his name for certain).  Her story is that she had a
&gt; bus but it got wrecked (not her fault) and was looking for a replacement.
&gt; She is a &quot;poor college kid&quot; 24 years old.  She made the trip down with four
&gt; friends in a converted school bus along with her dog.  She pulled the motor
&gt; from her wrecked bus, by herself.  Stipped it down so she could stow it in
&gt; the school bus and came on down.  When she got where her &quot;new&quot; bus is, she
&gt; put the engine back together (gen, fan, exhaust, etc) and put it in the bus
&gt; with a little help from the guy she was getting the bus from.  Pretty
&gt; impressive I think for a girl.  Yeah, I know, I'm being chauvanistic, but
&gt; you don't see girls everyday who can or want to do this sort of stuff.
&gt;
&gt; A neat thing, the guy she was going to buy this bus from originally wanted
&gt; $250 w/o motor.  It turned out that he gave her the bus.  I told her that
&gt; there was a precedence for this on the list (Charlie).  Anyway, she is
&gt; traveling back with just her dog.  She had the fuel pump and coil both fail
&gt; before she got out of Tennesee.  She was able to get the parts she needed at
&gt; a NAPA store (electric fuel pump and Honda coil) and get back on the road.
&gt; When she got to my house I asked if she needed anything and she said no.  I
&gt; gave her a place to camp for the night and let her take a shower and clean
&gt; up.  We stayed up late visiting and she left this morning.  I didn't see her
&gt; as I had to leave for work before she was up.  I hope she has a safe trip.
&gt;
&gt; Another neat Listmember encounter.  VW Bus people are great!
