&gt; 1. Will the '58 parking brake cables work?

Hi Duck,
No they will not.  You will have to use the 1964-67 cables and shorten them.  
We used cable U-clamps to do that.

&gt; 2. Will the motor mounts work? Are poly mounts OK?
&gt; 3. How about poly springplate bushings?

There are no motor mounts.  The rear tranny mounts are the same from at least 
1955-67.  The front mount will be a problem since you are putting a tunnel 
tranny in a split tranny case bus.  Have heard that some places are making a 
converter front mount for this or you could make one yourself if you have 
fabricating skills and welder.  Stick with stock rubber mounts and bushing 
where possible.  Poly ones transmits way too much road/engine noise.

&gt; 4. Are there other 'land mines' I should be concerned about?  The tranny has 
&gt; already been set up for 12volt flywheel and starter, and the RGB's are in 
&gt; fine shape.

You really should upgrade to the later 1964-67 front beam before installing a 
later tranny.  Otherwise you have bigger brakes on the rear and in panic 
situations on slippery/icy roads you will have the wrong braking ratio and 
spin out easier.
