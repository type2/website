You mean in addition to the parts, you expect to carry tools as well?

I personally ont tote as many spare parts around with me, and have even been 
known to drive around w/o a tool box in a bus, bt if I'm going on  a road 
trip, II check and repack the tool box and have a box of spare parts in the 
bus that I go through before setting off to make it more likely that when 
(not if) something goes funky I have the tool and part to fix it cause it 
would likely be unavailable where a mishap may be, and there are not many 
people I would like tinkering with a bus of mine, picky that I am.   What are 
you going to do if something breaks 50 miles from a town in Montana?  huh?   
where no one seems to drive vws or work on them  (okay, a very few, but how 
long am I going to wait for help? right)
