&gt; What are folks using to seal between the Westy Window and the Frame that
&gt; attaches to the Bus?  The Material that was in there looked like
&gt; something we, in the Autobody field, use to call Dum Dum Putty.  I
&gt; thought I had heard of someone here mention that before.  Lowes doesn't
&gt; seem to carry it.  So I guess it will be Silicone Chalking.
