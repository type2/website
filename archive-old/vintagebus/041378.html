  Mike, sorry about that. I don't think I was clear enough.  Plenty of
busses showed up and were out in the lot, I was just suprise to see so few
busses being presented inside the show area, wherein as years past we'd
have more then just 3 or 4 busses at the show area(granted this isn't a
classic or OCTO where busses abound).  So, just in terms of the show area
I was unthrilled, but outside the show plenty of busdrivers made the trip
in their bus! If my bus(ses) had some paint on them(one is down to bare
metal right now!)  and some added parts on the 63(still getting front
floors in and I'm about get the drivetrain up again..but the hardpart is
over for the standard sunroof!) then of course I would have made it in my
bus! Yet, neither of my two busses will be used for hauling(or the type of
hauling I was hopefully planning for). Still, I had a great time pickin'
thru the swap and seeing the lot.

cheers,
lincoln
63-23window walkthru(baremetal)
