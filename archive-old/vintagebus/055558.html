&gt;According to one of Kabayos old posts the 205/75/15 is one of the most
&gt;accurate sizes. Anyway I do not want to start a huge good tire bad tire
&gt;thing...All I want to know is has anyone put a set of 205/75/15's on a
&gt;stock height early bus.

I have a set of Goodyear G64s (195/75/15 8ply) on my 63 camper.  Recently 
I've had a slow leak in one of them and the Goodyear near me said they 
can't get the G64 anymore, so I'd have to go for a Dunlop if the tire 
needed replacement.  I'm assuming these are the same Dunlops.  I think that 
size would be fine on a stock bus.
