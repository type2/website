Subject: Re: [VB]dating/generator differences

Ah ha- you found the date code.  Now I'll see if I can dig out the date 
coding info ... here it is!
The letter refers to the year :
A 1945
B 1946
C 1947
D 1948  etc so

U is 1963

the number in 5U or 8U is the month, so 5U is May 1963

THink this dating system is used on Distributors as well.

&lt;&lt; Thanks for the response.  I will look more into it.  I have another 
generator laying around.  It a 6V that I had rebuilt about 10 years ago.  I 
think the numbers are the same, but there is one additional number directly 
adjacent to the tin above the long numbers.  My existing generator says 5U??  
and my other rebuilt says 8U??
