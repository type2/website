Subject: RE: [VB] front end question-related to my steering problem


You said you had a lot of play,this leads me to believe that you have a problem greater than interference with the steering assembly.

If it is the rod in the center of the vehicle and it still shifts and the swing lever is in contact with it the most likely cause is the center pivot mount has rusted off the axle beam,a common problem in the midwest.Time for a new beam or a very good CERTIFIED welder and a lot of labor time.

Subject: [VB] front end question-related to my steering problem


i was looking under my '67 bus today to see if i could see what was causing 
my steering problem when i saw something abnormal. there is a rod that runs 
over top of the tie rod ends from the steering box-all the way to the 
engine-what is this tube called? i am slowly getting more familiar with bus 
anatomy but could use some help. any way that tube is loose and resting on 
the bolts of the swing arm/tie rods- and not letting me steer normally-
is this a major problem? would it alone cause my steering to be very loose 
and creaks and pops when i steer? any professional diagnosis out there? 
thanks for you help.
