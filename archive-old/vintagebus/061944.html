Subject: Re: [VB] Slash rear bumper

It seems that the rear bumper was changed partway through the 65 model year.  
  I've seen VW pics with them both ways.

&lt;&lt; I am still reviewing all my parts I got with my 65 DC. I am in bumper mode 
now.
 
 I have a slash front bumper, which I think is correct, but I have a pointed 
end rear bumper. I think
 this is a 66-67 part based on what is on Wade's site.
 
 Does anyone have a slash rear bumper they want to sell or trade for a 
pointed end?
