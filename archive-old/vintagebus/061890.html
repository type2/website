Subject: Re: [VB] Theft on Tucson

This proves criminals are STUPID!  You risk going to jail for a set of
Bus Boys's safaris???  You'd think they'd at least go for the CE's or OG sets.

&gt; on this list so I am asking them to keep there eyes peeled for a freshly
&gt; painted (by the thief's I'm sure) set of Bus Boys (same as Wolfgang)
&gt; safaris,
