Subject: Re: [T2] New carb woes...

I would jet the carb like i had no idea what was in the old one.  If the old 
one was worn out, could be that the jetting was to compensate for some of 
the wear.  Who knows, this new one may have a slightly different design 
internally.  Also, if it did the same before and after the jet swap, i might 
look into anything else i did.  Anything different beside the carb?  Mess 
with the points?


Could you have moved your distributor during all of this swapping?
