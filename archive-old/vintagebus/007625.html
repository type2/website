The Sixth Annual Northeast Classic Volkswagen Festival is this Sunday and it
is on the way. The rest of the East coast shows are listed at
http://members.aol_dot_com/CommonGear/Calendar.html

I'll be wearing my AIRS tee so have them introduce themselves.

&gt; Just a little update on the guys that stopped by here a week or so ago
&gt; from Nebraska.  They and they're 71 bus are in New York today and should
&gt; be to Maine during the day some time.  They're doing well and haven't
&gt; had any more problems, but they say something is rattling in back,
&gt; probably engine tin or something of the like.
&gt;
&gt; Does anyone have a list of shows coming up on the east coast?  Anywhere
&gt; from Maine down to Florida.  I'd like to get these guys a list as they
&gt; were wanting to attend some shows/campouts while on their trip.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks!
