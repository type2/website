 I've seen two types: one that takes a domelight-type bulb, for the license 
plate
 light, and one that takes the same bulb as the later license plate lights.  I
 have no idea which is which, but I generally see the domelight style on the 
 earlier cars.  I think they're interchangable.
  &gt;&gt;

both 56 and 58 parts list show 

211 945 309- housing stop and liscence plate light
and
211 945 309 A housing stop and liscence plate light (for USA only) M164

for the lens , one version is shown for till ch 20-041 711, one after

I  remember there being dif kinds of brake light bulb holders,    but forget 
the difference.  If someone really needs one, I believe I still have the 
original one from my bus, which I replaced with the NOS one.  It was 
functional I think, just not perfect.  then again, maybe it's garbage.

cross check w/ engine lid:
  
211 927 025 deckel hinten (post barndoor/truck version)

271 827 025 deckel hinten bis 20-117 901  model 271-271 (barndoor ambo lid)
211 827 031A    regular barndoor engine lid


note the A version w/o the plain version- this from 56 list, the lid was 
superceded already- ? at ch 20-41 xxx when lens was changed?

the 58 ed list also has 

211 827 025B  which would be the flat decklid used from mid 57.   so what 
happened to the A version?  there are two slightly dif versions of the post 
bd/truck brakelight decklid.  early one used through Wolfsberg buses?  I have 
found a couple on post BD 55 buses.
