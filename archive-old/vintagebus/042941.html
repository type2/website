I've welded my clips on a few ocassions cuz I'm a poor college student and
don't want to fork out the money for rivets and the tool to put them on
and my roommate just happened to have a MIG wirefeed welder.  Worked fine
for me!

&gt; I would highly advise against welding.  I'm sure it's been done before but I
&gt; can almost guarantee you'll break clips.  I insisted that I never would -
