Subject: '59 Single Cab...driver's rocker replacement

I worked on the driver's side rocker on my '59 SC last weekend and 
finished it up this weekend. Worst part was cutting out all the old 
rusted stuff. But I got it all done and welded in a new inner rocker 
and full bus rocker section from Wolfsburg West. All in all it seems 
to have turned out pretty good. Pictures posted here:

Next on the list will need repairing or replacing a section of the 
driver's dogleg and repairing/replacing the rear corners. The corners 
are gonna probably be the hardest part of the metal fixes on my truck.
