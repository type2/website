Subject: BBBB Memorial Weekend

If you are anywhere close to the midwest, you don't want to miss the BBBB
show and campout coming up on Memorial weekend.

We have busses coming from TX, OK, KS, NE, IA, MO, AR, CA (that's right
CALIFORNIA!!) and hopefully from NM and WI.  These are just the states that
I know about, there may be many others when Memorial weekend hits.

We are going to have a blast, you don't want to miss it.

Please pass this along to other VW lists, thanks.
