Subject: Solex/Bocar 30 PICT 1 rebuild questions

Hello all!

I am in the process of rebuilding the Solex/Bocar 30 PICT 1 that
is on the '68 Beetle 1500 in my '64.  The last time I ran it on
the Bus, it was visibly leaking around the throttle shaft and
from the air horn/body seam - a fine mist of gas formed on the
outside of the carb in these areas.  I noticed this after trying
to adjust it so it wouldn't run so rich; there was lots of black
smoke and soot from the tailpipe and it seemed to get poor gas
mileage.  My theory is that it had been set to run rich to try
and compensate for the leak around the throttle shaft.

When I first tore it down, the little brass kitchen-sink-faucet 
accelerator pump squirter, at the very top of the body, just
came out with finger pressure.  There is a little flange around
the bottom - I am assuming I can just press this back into place
with a screwdriver or similar on the flange?  Should I use any
sealing/locking goop on this?

I had the throttle shaft bore rebushed at a local shop.  When
they did this, however, they just machined off the peened portion
of the throttle plate screws.  I could easily back out the screws
with a small screwdriver.  This means to me that I need to get
some longer screws and properly peen them - Loctite would _probably_
work but it costs a piston or a valve to find out for sure.

For grins I went ahead and removed the throttle plate and took out
the throttle shaft.  The brass bushing on the left (throttle lever)
side stayed in the carb, but the bushing on the right (accelerator
pump) side came out with the shaft!  It is steel and knurled on
its OD; the shaft bore has obviously been drilled for it but it
wasn't seated down.  Can I just tap this back in with a suitable
drift or is this likely to cause me problems?

I checked the body/air horn mating by putting the air horn on the 
body with no screws or gasket; I could see a little bit of light
in the gap.  I screwed the air horn down with 5 screws (still no
gasket) and tried some feeler gauges in the gap; I can fit an
.004 inch gauge in the gap on the left side and front of the float
bowl, and an .006 gauge in the gap under and just behind the fast
idle cam!  Will the gasket take up this slack, or is more gap than
the gasket can fill?  Would Permatex on the gasket or instead of
the gasket help?  Or should I be looking at lapping (?) down the air
horn or body to get a flat fit?

For now I am going to run with the jets that were in it, because
I want to see how fixing the other problems this carb has helps
before I fool with the jets.  I am running the stock oil-bath air
cleaner and a stock late-model exhaust (single outlet on the right
side of the muffler instead of the left, with damper pipe and
tail pipe running to left rear).  Right now it has an 0120 main,
g55 pilot, and 125z air correction/emulsion tube.  The Without
Guesswork and Bentley manuals suggest that there is also a pilot
jet air bleed, a pump injection tube (aka?) fuel jet for pump, and
a power fuel jet.  I think the pilot air bleed is the little brass
disc just above where the pilot air jet screws in, visible from
the top of the main body.  The pump injection tube is, I think,
the kitchen-sink-faucet bit that sprays down into the throat.

The only jet I'm confused on is the power fuel jet.  When I look
down into the float bowl, I can see a brass thing pointing down,
just inboard of the right wall where the accelerator pump is.
It has threads inside it.  When I look into the hole in the 
accelerator pump cavity, I can see the &quot;nose&quot; of this brass bit.
Is this the power fuel jet?  Is it supposed to come out?  It
looks like I would need to thread something down into the top
of it (inside the float bowl) to pull it out. 

I know this is long, but this is the first carb I've done that
needed more TLC than just a trip to the Berryman Spa and a gasket
kit.  And I've already gotten lots of good help from the list
with my earlier questions about it.  Thanks for your continued
help!
