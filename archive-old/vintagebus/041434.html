Sounds like you made yourself some good Carma.  It's just old bus stuff.
Busses are what I like to drive, bugs too.  Don't take it too
seriously.  I think the people that get too wrapped up in it for the wrong
reasons loose out on the enjoyment of it.  I hope a bus with a two piece
windshield will come your way and you won't care much about a seat that
didn't have a bus.
I was thinking when I read about that seat that I would take a Dodge 
minivan seat and put it in my bus and feel a whole lot better about it.
I think the back of my 67 was mainly for dog transport.  There's still dog
slobber all over the back popouts, nobody would want to sit back there
even if there was a seat.  Maybe if I cleaned it up some.
