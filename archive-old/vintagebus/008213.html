Subject: Re: [VB] loose Flywheel?  [WAS: A New *dunk* sound]

Not necessarily.

Our old '68 Westy had a loose flywheel, unknown to us as it made no unusual
noise, etc.  Our first clue was when the engine died at a stoplight and made
horrible noises when we tried to restart.

Had it towed to the repair shop, and when they pulled the engine the
flywheel fell out on the floor!

After close inspection the engine appeared unharmed  -  even the threads in
the crank and endplay were OK.  They reinstalled the flywheel with a new
glandnut and we got another 25,000+ miles out of that engine.

FWIW.....

&gt;&lt;&lt; loose flywheel? &gt;&gt;

&gt;That would be a possibility, but the engine would run (If it would run at
&gt;all!) for only minutes before destroying itself.
