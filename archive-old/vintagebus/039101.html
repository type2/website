I would call Greyhound. The bus company. Not too many people I have run
across know this, but they will ship damn near anything for very little
money. They ship the stuff in tho bottoms of the passenger busses when they
dont fill up. A few years back I needed to send a ghia windshield from New
jersey to Texas. UPS fell off the chair laughing at me and the postal
service wouldnt even consider it. I called Greyhound and they said no prob,
and even let me insure it! The only catch is you have to drop it off at a
gryhound station and the other person has to pick it up at his local
station. They dont deliver to houses. Im not sure about the hoops size, but
I would guess that if it fits in the bottom of a bus then they can help you.

Does anyone out there know of a way to ship a canopy (tilt). I'm selling
one to a guy back East but it's been difficult finding someone to ship
the hoops. The wood and canvas is not a problem. Just the hoops. Any
ideas????

Thanks,
Greg
