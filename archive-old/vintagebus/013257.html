&gt; I have a faint memory of an antenna that consisted of a fairly thin 
&gt; strand of copper wire wound on a length of nylon line, making it
fairly 
&gt; easy to set up the antenna at night, and to real it in when making
camp. 
&gt; But I didn't see such a thing at Radio Shack.  Does anyone know
where to 
&gt; get one?

Try Amateur Electronics Supply.
