&gt; Hi Sunbuggy,
&gt; Take it to a wash rack, not one of those car wash places where it just gets 
&gt; towed through a wash system.  At a wash rack you handle a pressure washer 
&gt; sprayer wand, feed coins into the machine and you crawl around while cleaning 
&gt; your VW.

And for goodness sake, be careful not to aim that spray at any place
where parts move relative to each other, like where the swing axles pivot
on the axle, the ball joints/link pins, tie rod ends, etc.  You won't like
the results if you blast a quantity of alkaline soapy water into the front
axle.  Rust and frozen bearings soon follow.

I prefer more subtle methods.  The high-pressure spray can just do too
much damage.  It's OK if you are going to immediately tear down and
rebuild the parts you're cleaning, but otherwise it's dangerous.
