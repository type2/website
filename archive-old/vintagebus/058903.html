Subject: [VB] Interior sources


A buddy of mine has just sent his 67 Double Cab off to the paint shop.
This means he needs interior stuff soon. He really wants to have the
black and grey salt and pepper seats. They don't have to be exactly like
original, just give the same feel as original salt and pepper. Anyway I
was thinking about Doug Denlinger (I hope that is the right name) or
someone like that. He is planning on putting the covers on himself but
could be convinced otherwise. Anyway does anyone have some good leads
for seat covers and interior stuff or Dougs number.
thanks
