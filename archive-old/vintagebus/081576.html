Is it not the same door... just flip it around for the other side?

mmm,

I don't think its Oz specific - South African Crews
are the same.  I think all RHD split crews had the suicide passenger
door
until the end of production.....don't know why ... possibly
cos the rear cargo door on a bus provides the 'standard' part
needed and that just the way the 'hingeing' works out...
(although the front
cargo door on a bus would go very close to providing a 'standard' part
for a non-suicide door - the middle lip would have to be changed)


&gt; .......
&gt; We still have the suicide style passengers compartment door too!
