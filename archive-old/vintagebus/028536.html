Subject: Bowden Tube

A few on the list were helping me with this, but didn't know the answer
so I'll post to everyone.

Was there ever a change in length for the bowden tube?  The one I took
off my big nut tranny (in a 62 crew cab) seemed to have too much swage
in it.  Almost an inch more than the Bentley said it should have.  I
couldn't find anyway to adjust it out, am I wrong?  I could see how
adding washers would induce more bend in the tube, but the one I took
off didn't have any in there.    Anyone know how long in inches the tube
should be?

BTW my parts book only shows one tube with no years designation.

Sleeve - Clutch Cable 311 721 365

Is this correct???
