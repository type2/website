I second that,
*ENOUGH* of these people who have something for sale but won't name a price!
Greg
57 standard (for sale, 100K)
56 westy (for sale, 65K)
Above prices are firm, in U.S. dollars and do not include delivery.
Will not answer any questions about above vehicles without a copy of W2, a 
credit report, and a 25% non-refundable deposit.

&quot;Taking Bids&quot; but he reserves the right not to sell it to the highest 
bidder?!?

  Screw that, he obviously has a price in mind, just ask that price.


Neat tent, though.
