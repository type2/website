Subject: Re: [VB] Rear Shift Coupler Screw


There was a post fairly recently stating that you could get the correct size 
square socket at sear although I don't recall the size.  Will advise if I 
find the post but try searching the archive... it should be there.

&gt; &gt; I need to buy a new rear shift coupler for my '67

&gt; &gt; The problem is I can't remove my old one because the
&gt; &gt; screw has a square head. There is an image of the
&gt; &gt; screw in
&gt; &gt; http://www.wolfsburgwest_dot_com/cgi-bin/wwshowpn.cgi?PN=111711189
&gt; &gt; Is there any kind of special tool to do this?

&gt;Ricardo,
&gt;I have used a 9mm 12pt. socket to do this.  Local VW expert told me of
&gt;a 5/16 star socket Snap On makes that works better.  Think it cost me
&gt;about $5.
&gt;You can also usually get an open end wrench in there but sometimes it's
&gt;hard to get leverage if the grub screw is really frozen in.  Spray some
&gt;good penetrating oil on for a couple days if it's frozen up, try heat etc.
