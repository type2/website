   Does any one know who was selling a bunch of body panels last week.
   I believe they had gotten the inventory of a business that closed down 
and they were offering like 50% of to list members,I forgot to save it so if 
you have any idea let me know.
                                                           Carl,
                                                      freezing in alaska
