Subject: Judson SC project.  Finally installed and running

Well,  I finally got the Super Charger in today.  Took about 6 hours
because i forgot to get a few things in advance.

I bought 2 40 HP Judson's about 2 years ago.  Over the last year, I
built a new 40HP motor for my bug and rebuilt one of the Judson units. I
also aquired and rebuilt a 010 dizzy to compliment the Judson.  It went
on last week.   Going into the project, i thought i knew what i needed
and how to install it.  Well, i learned alot more today that i did not
already know..

I recieved a Marvel oiler with the unit also.  In trying to find a new
glass bottle, i contacted Marvel and they volintered to give me a new
bottle and also rebuild and recalibrate my oiler. For free.  Very nice
people over at Marvel.  The cared about my oiler that was bought 30+
years ago like i bought it yesterday.  (Plug aleart)

Anyway...

In putting it together, i found out that you need a spacer for the carb
and a replacment front piece for the generator.  Well, i found the space
(i did not even know i had it) and ended up shaving off the front lip of
a extra generator pulley.  Worked very nice.  The rest of the install
went well.  Judson instructed me to remove my coil and remount it with
only one of the mount bolts.  Kind of rinky-dink, but it worked.  I had
to get a new Main jet, but that was not problem.  The other thing i had
to rig was the connection for the accelerator cable.  I do not know how
it was done originally so i made it work my way.  Anyone know how it
worked originally?

Once installed, the engine fired up right away.  Sounded very nice too.
The engine definetly has more power and was pepier (SP?)  Drove it over
to a fellow listee to pick up some Bus parts he had for me.  The bug
drove very nicely on the freeway.  I was at 65 MPH in no time and was
not into the gas pettle like i normally would be.  I did not push it
though.  I do not really want to go any faster, just want to have a
little more if i ever need it. (Some yahoo who pull's in fornt of me or
??)  (A statment i heard about VW's and Judsons came to mind:  &quot;Install
it Friday night and Rebuild the motor Sunday&quot;.  I do not want to do
that.)  I can realy feal when the engine get's that extra fuel and also
when i take it away.  The car kind of surges.

Other things that i found out were that it is real tight in there when
you try to close the engine lid.  The Judson's upper pulley cut my
license plate light wire in two almost immediatly.  I will have to
re-rout that.  Also had to cut the center screw for the license plate
mount.  Pulley still rub's on the deck lid when i accelerate but that
will go away once i get the support bracket in there. (something else i
did not have)  The engine is noisier.  The Judson clicks alot as the
vanes slide around.   There is also alot more vibration in the car.  I
think this is becase i do not have the support bracket, but don't really
know.  I have a feeling that i will be getting real BAD gas milage
though.  Putting in that 135 Main jet and then sucking more fuel is
going to make my 20mgp go down.  Oh well.

Overall, i am happy that it all works.  I hope that i can take care of
these issuesand keep the unit on the engine.  If it fights me too much,
well i will take it off and only intstall it for show's and the such.

Anyway, another Judson back on the road. (for now)
