Yes, yes....that 3-speed system for using a Ford or something switch for
using 12 volts to give a 6 volt wiper motor 3 speeds....I thought I saved
that post, but anyone care to direct me?  I can't find it...JP?

&gt; Yes, this popping out will happen with a 6V wiper on a 12V system,   It is
&gt; not designed for that speed.   I suggest a voltage drop, easy and cheap,
less
&gt; hassle than swapping motors, no denting of defrost ducts needed.
&gt;
&gt; You could even try JPs interesting system of using a switch which will
allow
&gt; you 3 speeds.
