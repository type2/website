Lazy Americans. Why I oughta get outta my barco-lounger and whup your
ass, 'cept I don't feel like it right now.

The Urban Legend as I heard it from an Austrian Mechanic I knew was that
German specs required the engine to be at or near 100 degrees Ferenheit
when the valves were set. Well, you can imagine the confusion that
caused all mechanics everywhere, especially the 'Mericans who couldn't
deal with more than a single variable in any equation...so them who make
such decisions decided that it was nearly as good to set them at a
Stone-Cold John Muir ( Not Steve Austin!) and make it .152mm ( or .006&quot;
if you are on the mars probe). I have always set my intakes to either a
very tight .006 (or .005 if I have that feeler gauge), and the exhausts
to a looser .006&quot;.  I aint never yet seen intakes tighten up that much,
even after some serious overheating it is usually the exhaust valves
that are needing adjustment.

Or have I been smoking the idiot guide again? Anyone else notice how the
older editions were easier to use as rolling paper? Maybe it is all the
grease stains.
