Subject: steering box

Hey guys, it's been a while since I posted on the list. I am slowly in the 
process of restoring my 1960 SO-23. Tonight while removing the axel from my 
1960 parts bus we decided to remove the steering box also, unfortunately 
after removing the four bolts on the box it would not come all the way out 
to separate the steering wheel from the box. How do you separate the two? 
Any advice is much appreciated.


Thanks,
Nathan

60 SO-23
85 Westy
85 Cabriolet
