Are these harnesses from Wiring Works totally complete?  Are the dome lights 
included?

No

In regards to the fuse blocks, I remember a post a while back saying that 
some (all?) of the repro'd ones were set up backwards.  Is this the case.  
They might work, but I really dont want a backwards one.  
&gt;&gt;

I thought it was just the numbers on the plastic lens cover that were 
backwards?
