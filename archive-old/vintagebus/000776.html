&lt;&lt; what are all the things that could make an engine cough? &gt;&gt;
Hi Isaiah,
If the engine is warmed up after about 15 minutes of driving and still has 
this problem then here are some of the more likely possibilities.
1.  Crud in the accelerator nozzle circuit.  Which when cleaning a carb for 
the first time means almost always redoing it again if not a third time to 
get all of the crud out of inside of the passageways.  
2.  Too big of pilot jet and/or adjusted fuel/air mixture screw.
3.  Way too big or small of main jet.
4.  Wrong distributor for carb.
