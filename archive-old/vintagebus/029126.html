Why?  IMHO--The -BBB - OCTO - Jerome Bus Shows feature Driven Buses--I think these shows stand out because the vehicles are unique--and driven--This is what sets us, VW Bus owners, apart from the &quot;Other&quot; Car shows--If an owner of  VW Bus wants to step up and enter a Concours Show--there are plenty of those around--I once owned a 68 bus that
won 1st place in its class at &quot;World of Wheels&quot;--it had 100,000+ miles on it  But still all original--&quot;Bambi&quot; beat out a Big Bird, and a Barracuda that were fully restored--The PO of Bambi deserves all the credit
for maintaning the bus--I think the VW Bus shows are what the VW bus owners are all about--
Driving and keeping on the road one of the most unique vehicles ever made--&quot;The Splitty&quot;
Vintage VW?-Drive-um--!
