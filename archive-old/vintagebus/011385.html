&gt; DON'T BUY BUGPACK!!!!!

You sound surpised.  I *never* use bugpack stuff.  It's all (or a good %)
made in Taiwan and points east, and I have yet to see any of it actually 
fit.  Another example of *crap* out there, and the only way they stay in
business is that people actually *buy* the stuff...  As P.T. Barnum said...
