 &gt; Geez I would love to get out of town and go on a big

 Clara, I've seen pictures of your junkyard trips. Buses strapped on top of 
 buses.  You could probably tell some folks how to drive down mountains
 using engines and brakes with a double high center of gravity.:)

I hauled that down and up a big hill, went in 2nd gear up the hill at close 
to 100F outside with a non advancing distributor I manually set to 30 advance 
to get home on.  then over the cascades.   drove slow, took a long time, got 
home safely, about 250 miles  :)   that was my 65 westy, pre shiny paint, 
corners were a bit odd
