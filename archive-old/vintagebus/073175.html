Subject: Re: '65 Wiper Motor

Thanks Matt. I pulled it apart last night and discovered that the armature had been jammed and would not turn freely. I fixed that and after a little troubleshooting of the wiper switch wiring, all is working properly now! That's a good thing too as I see thunderstorms are possible this weekend in Jerome!
