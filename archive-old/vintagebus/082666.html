Subject: Re: 36 hp Engine Number

&gt; Got a bus with a 36hp engine in it. Engine number is: A030268X.

I seem to have absorbed the following from somewhere: the &quot;X&quot; at the end
means it is a rebuilt or exchange engine.  The &quot;A&quot; at the front means
that it was rebuilt to the specifications of an &quot;A&quot; engine, which
according to the 1969 &quot;Without Guesswork&quot; manual was a 30 HP (DIN), 36 HP
(SAE), 1192cc engine that was installed in Beetles from December 1953 up
to July 1965.

The only flaw in that logic is that if the 030 268 is the original case
number, that would put it before '53 (according to the chart in the Idiot
manual) and make a 25 HP (DIN), 30 HP (SAE) engine.  Another possibility
is that somebody at the factory didn't stamp the leading 1 once they got
past 1 million engines and it's really 1 030 268, which would put it
between December 1954 and August 1955 according to the Idiot manual.  Yet
another possibility is that rebuilt/exchange engines had their own serial
number series and yours is about the 30,000th engine that was rebuilt.

I can't, at the moment, find official VW sources for any of this.  I've
checked the '50-'62, '63-'67, and '68-'79 Bentleys, the 1954 and 1967
parts lists available online, and the '69 and '73 Without Guesswork
manuals available online.  I think I've read it in some official VW
publication; maybe the Bentley for 70s Bugs (which I don't have handy).
Or maybe I just absorbed it from the list.

I hope this helps!
