&lt;&lt; Then the bus died on me, in a very electrical system type way. I quickly 
discovered the problem. My coil had slipped and the positive side was 
grounding out against my oil filter. I pushed the coil back into position, 
and everything seemed to be running fine. &gt;&gt;
Hi Arron,
That is bad.  The wire to the coil is one of the few that is not fused.  So 
there could be damage to the wiring and/or ignition switch!  Check how much 
voltage is getting to the coil.  Eric&amp;Barb
