Subject: Friday Bus  Fun

Howdy!

Just wanted to share a Friday Bus moment with the list, I just took myself
and 8 co-workers to lunch in my '66 Deluxe.  No problems at all, even made
it up the on ramp and onto the freeway to cruising speed.  I think they all
secretly now want a Bus.  After re-doing all the brake lines this week, I
can't think of a better way for a test drive!

Have a great weekend,
Gary
