&gt;Measuring the surface area of the front tin, leaves me with just a bit more
&gt;area than the stock louvers provide, effectivly doubling the avaliable
&gt;airflow to the engine bay. Hmmm. Must be why it runs so much cooler on the
&gt;highway than when I had that piece of tin in place. I'd be willing to bet
&gt;that I have very little, in my engine bay with that much intake area for the
&gt;fan to pull from.
&gt;
&gt;The stock louvers may have been enough for small motors with small cooling
&gt;fans, but putting in larger engines, with larger cooling systems will find
&gt;the stock designs limits.

one thing to keep in mind - the VW is a &gt;compromise&lt; between many 
demands... cruise 60kph for 8 hours, not have a radiator to boil or 
freeze, carry 4 fully-loaded wehrmacht members -er, deutsche 
pikinikers...   :)
i'm willing to bet that the front tin also PREVENTS too MUCH air from 
getting in in colder climes, causing reduced temps/efficiency.
as you up ccs and carb size, yes, the AF/H is gonna  have to go up. 
but unless you live in AZ, i would leave the tin on and think of some 
other way to increase air to the fan.
'course, you could simply do  a seasonal pull - spring, metalmesh tin 
goes in; fall, the standard tin.
