&gt;Don't forget a cell phone as well, unless you're good with smoke signaling.

I think the original poster was contemplating a trip to Alaska, where
the cell coverage may be something less than continuous.  For that situation
I would suggest at least a CB radio and maybe a &quot;linear&quot; for it.  Yes,
before the hams flame me, I know that the 500-watts-for-$50 linears
really suck and splatter all over and so on.  What I mean is for the
linear to *only* be used in case of emergency.  An even better solution
if you have the license for it would be an HF-band ham radio, where
you can (legally) talk further with lower power.

Also, one way to acquire spares on the cheap is by regular maintenance.
If you change your fan belt before the old one is shot, the old one can
be your spare.  If your old spark plugs aren't totally trashed, clean
them up, re-gap, and put them in the spares box.  Etc.
