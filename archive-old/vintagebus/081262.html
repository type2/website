Subject: Re:67 Westie Sheet metal

Clark, Yes that floor section is different stamping, has been that way with
repops for years, most all the suppliers I have seen have that very panel.
If anyone else other than me does the drivers side with the correct pattern,
I would love to know it. Pmail me if you interested or I can help with any
metal questions.
