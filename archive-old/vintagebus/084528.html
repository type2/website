Thanks,  but why only after a good long high speed run?? Works great for
quite some  time.



Hi Chris,
We think that when cool there is fuel condensed on the walls  of the 
manifold/s.  When well warmed up there is none.  So when  you let up on the gas pedal 
increasing vaccum, there is no fuel to  evaporate and even out the fuel/air 
mixture.
  Anything else we can think of (loose tranny mounts, loose electrical  
connections, etc.) would not be affected by engine temp.
