Subject: Re: [VB] gas tank resto  varnish/sludge

Ronnie,

I'm in the middle of this right now with a T3 tank.  Car sat since 1980!
 Man that smell is bad. I had a POR 15 tank resto kit sitting around
that was for my Westy resto, but the T3 needs to get on the road.  I did
as the directions say, and their &quot;Marine Clean&quot; didn't even come close
to cleaning it out.  I used chain/rocks along with it to bang all the
loose stuff out, but still it was heavily encrusted with varnish and
surface rust.  I then used the phosphoric acid that came with the kit
and while it works wonders on surface rust, since the caked on varnish
was still in the tank the acid could not get to a lot of the rust.  

One minor note on the acid though, it is a FANTASTIC rust stain
remover!!  I accidentally spilled some on the bed of my truck which is
heavily stained with rust.  30 minutes later when I realized the tank
(T3) had leaked on to the bed I was shocked to see unbelievably clean
original paint!  I used some more with the same results.  I'll be using
it on the rest of the bed and all the other rust stained paint else
where on the DC.

Regarding the current tank project, I ended up taking it to a local
radiator repair shop (no easy feat to find a shop that would do it) that
said they would acid dip it.  I talked to a shop that wanted to cut it
open and then blast it, weld it up, and coat the inside...$150! I'm sure
this is the best way to go, but at a third the price of the car....no
thanks.  The acid dip will run me about $50 but I have to have a tank,
and early T3 tanks are not showing up at my local pull a part :-(

&gt; Finally made time to work on getting the 57 on the road. It's been sitting
&gt; since 88 when it was driven down to one of the so cal shows and back and
&gt; had been parked for an unknown amount of time prior to 88. You can smell the
&gt; varnish when you open the tank. fuel resevrve switch was completely clogged
&gt; and gummed up to the point that I had to remove it to drain the tank.
&gt; Looking at the por-15 kit they claim their chemicals will clean this out but
&gt; the hot rod guys I've talked to say nothing will and I should have it sand
&gt; blasted inside. Anyone have hands on experience with cleaning out a tank
&gt; with 10-15 years of varnish build up? Using this product or any
&gt; other?http://www.por15_dot_com/tankseal_fuelpreserve.htm&gt;
