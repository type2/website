Since my Leatherman has several blades &amp; tools broken, I went to Sportstown 
the other night to step up to a SuperTool, since they had them on sale for 
$39 (regular $59).

I got home &amp; looked up their website and there is a vintage bus reference 
on the site.  Go to http://www.leatherman_dot_com/default_frame.html 

and scroll down to the sales pitch on the Leatherman Flair...

I'm more of a Guiness man myself, so I did not need the girly corkscrew...
