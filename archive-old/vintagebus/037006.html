&lt;&lt; Work has been hell lately, so it has kept me from bus work.  Todd Hill is
 moving away, so we have some transaxle work to complete... driving down to
 Olympia to meet with him today.  Hope to meet Eric of &quot;Eric &amp; Barb&quot; on this
 visit. &gt;&gt;
Hi Steven,
LOL when we read this upon getting back to Barb's dad's place.  Had to take
his blood sugar level before dinner so we were in a rush when we saw you.
Good looking double cab and it was good to meet you even briefly!  

&lt;&gt;
Correct!!

&lt;&lt;Anyone done a swap of a &quot;front beam&quot; (assuming I'm calling it the right
name) -- my steering is pretty bad and I have been told the tie-rods look new.
From what everyone says, rebushing the front steering is a pain... would this
1960 part go on my 1963 without problem?&gt;&gt;
What rebushing?  Just the center pin and or the king and links?  Would highly
reccomend instead to install a 1964-67 bus front suspension it has 20% bigger
brakes and they feel more like 50%.  We installed on both front and rear
suspension of this kind in our 1960.  Made a real improvement in stopping and
now does not have the brake fade problems which it had even when the lightly
loaded on steep hills in and out of Seattle.  We even installed only a front
1964-67 suspension in a friends 1959 DD panel.  She noticed a big differance
immeadiately after when she moved to New Mexico.  She was very happy that we
had made the suggestion to do the change.
