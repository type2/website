Everett, 
Are you looking for a divider for a panel van?  The panel vans had brackets
that ran up the sides and some trim across the top to hold the divider in
place.  They also have threaded holes in the edge of the seat bulkhead to
attach the bottom.  I don't know your bus so I don't know if that applies to
it.  I bought a cab divider from a friend in Washington and it didn't survive
the UPS trip.  It was an original '58 divider (i think..) and was quite
brittle.  When he accidentally shipped it to Texas, then back to Washington,
then to me in Maryland it arrived in 3 pieces.  So I bought a sheet of
masonite type stuff and went to work with an electric jigsaw.  I used my bits
as a template and swapped the hardware (2 metal vertical supports, window
glass and seal) over to the new one.  It turned out really nice, but due to
*standard measure* (yuck!) it is a little thinner than the original.  I was
thinking that in the future I would like to make a slightly thicker one and
maybe ad some 356 porsche or similar headrests for some anti-whiplash
protection.  If you would like, after I test fit my divider and make sure that
my top radius is correct (my original was really rough by the time I got it),
I can lay it down on some huge newsprint and make a template and mail it out
to you in a tube.  I can send pictures of the hardware that you would be
missing as well as a tracing of the glass... or you could always opt for a
*custom* sliding window for a little air circ...

I have shipped a couple dividers, but included a piec eof plywood sheet to be
sturdy!!! If t did break, no one told me.   Yes- the divider can be cut out of
hardboard, which does not come n metric sizes, (:().  But you can also hang a
curtain from the sides of the bus, ties it to the rear of the fresh air vent,
oops, sorry, well, sure you can figure a way.    Use a piece of rear curtain
rod from a bay window bus, so it sproings against the roof for maximum
reduction of drafts, screw it into the holes where the roof panels went,  and
use something thick as a curtain.  Rear view mirrors?  hah!   We don't need no
steenkin rear view!!!!
