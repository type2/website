I have been in california for 1 day and have seen one bus.  It was a grey and 
white standard parked on the streets of NAPA where I am visiting for the week.
One bus is more then I saw here in Napa three years ago.
I hope to see more buses as the week unfolds.  I am going to visit with Mike 
Brown in sacramento on sunday.  Anyone else care to come out?
So Bay area bus drivers, get busy and drive those buses.  I need something to 
look forward to while im in the area.
