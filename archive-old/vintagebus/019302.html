Hi Les,  

Do you mean to say that you currently own the exact VW Splitty on the cover
of the May 1972 issue of National Geographic?  If so, that's awesome!  For
those who don't know, the cover photo shows a Pearl White after market VW
Splitty Camper with a canoe on the roof stopped on a forest road with all
sorts of very stupid tourists who are WAY too close to, and are checking
out a wild bear. Les, what's the story, are you sure you have that exact
Bus?  And did you say that you just got a copy of that issue, or are you
still waiting to find one at a reasonable price?  You really need to post
current photos of that Bus so we can all enjoy the before and after!  

I have several copies of that issue in my VW literature collection.  Neat
cover shot!

Who knows of other photos of Busses or other older VW's in other issues of
National Geographic.  If you know of any, e-mail me personally and the
entire list on Friday...  Congratulations Les!

Bill Bowman
