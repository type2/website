Subject: identifying pulleys

Hey, thanks to whoever it was that mailed me the Feb 1997 pulley article out
of Dune Buggies and Hot VW mag. My daughter opened the mail an threw away the
envelope. It went a long way in helping identify some of these odd pulleys I
have laying around. I didn't realize that I still had half a doz 40 hp pulleys
left. I also have a few that I have filed a 0 degree notch in when timing was
set up on the open case half. I think that anyone who has questions on pulleys
would find this article of great use.
