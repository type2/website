Subject: 15 window hit in record time

My friend was takin his 1960 15window out for the first time the other day,
when it stalled out in traffic in a single lane street. Luckily (or
unluckily, depending on how you look at it) his wife was behind him. He
couldn't get it restarted and there was no pulloff, So since he hadnt
mounted the bumper yet, he lined up her car with the bus bumper brackets, so
she could push him out of traffic. Everyone was honkin and goin bezerk, and
as she pushed, the bus pulled away from the car as they rounded the top of
the slight incline, so she pannicked and gassed it and slammed into the back
of the bus, crushing the newly painted apron and decklid and crushing the
bracket down.  So if anyone happens to dig a rear apron or decklid out from
their stash, lemme know. All the junkyards and parts houses around here dont
have anything.
