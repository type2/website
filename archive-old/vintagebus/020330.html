i just got done overhauling my drivetrain on my 59' bus
this was supposed to be my weekend toy but this past 
weekend i had to return my company car. so this week 
since my bus is still in the works ive been forced to 
drive my 63' bug... gosh how i forgot how much fun it 
was driving from san jose to san francisco in the early 
morning. i had a smile on my face the whole way there.
yes waterpumpers are sometimes needed becouse they are 
fast , have a.c , heat , and comy seats. but i rather 
freeze in the winter , melt in the summer, and everytime 
i get out of my vw having spring imprints on my rump.
