Yes, those are the preheat pipe cover plates, which I had on my list. 
They bolt to the rear cover and to the cylinder covers.  Inside are
some fiberous seals that stop air from coming in around the preheat
pipes.  You're right in that these are often missing, but I feel that
they must be important. VW went to a lot of effort to design and
install these little bits.

Often, the captive nut in the cylinder cover that are used  by the
preheat pipe cover plates is missing.  I like to braze these nuts in
place to ensure that they don't fall out.
