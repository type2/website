Are you going to the &quot;50 years of the bus&quot; show in Auburn Hills, MI on May
19-20?  i think thats the date... someone will take it! maybe one of us DBGers
here in WI/IL?  I'd take it...but Stella is in dire need of a new motor...I
changed the oil and the oil was glittery with metal shavings!! eek!  maybe it
was from the bad head I had?  I replaced it already...when I took out the valve
on #4 exhaust..the guide fell into my hands :(  but she runs ok now...but I
think the rings are shot...as smoke comes out of my exhaust...

oh well...
anyways...who's all going to the MI show?


&gt; can anyone help me with who gets it after the last
&gt; Michigan bus hands it off?
