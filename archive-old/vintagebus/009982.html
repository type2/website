If you don't remember me, I'm the guy in MO/KS that lost my 4rth gear. Well
it has since been returned to me..... It is finally time to leave Kansas
after 4 days of greasy oily work on putting in another transmission (not to
mention free use of season tickets to Sundays KC Chiefs game, and a steak
dinner tonight). I managed to find a used one a little ways backwards
somewhere in MO. Made a little trip out of picking it up and bringing it
back. It turned out to be a small nut, with reduction boxes and drums......
I proceeded to spend the first day taking the new transmission all apart, as
well as removing the engine and transmission from the bus, and pulling the
reduction boxes and axles tubes off. All went well (except I broke that
little shifter coupling thingy).... Day 2 saw me put my old axle tubes and
reduction boxes onto the new tranny. And tried to put the new tranny in. The
nose cones looked about the same, but they aren't ...... so out comes the
tranny and on goes the other nose cone (without regard to looking at what
gear it was in or where I placed that shifter thing)..... Hook up the
shifter only to find 2 gears ..... ponder at the old transmission, see how
things work, think that new transmission must be in a gear..... without
actually taking the transmission out of the bus, I got the nose cone off and
popped the little lever out of the gear it was in ...... back it goes.....
all four gears, plus reverse.... Put in some tranny oil ...... watch it pour
out one of the reduction boxes all over the floor ....... seems I messed up
a seal pretty bad between the reduction box and the shaft the drum goes on.
(The little metal thing in-between the shaft and seal was frozen on the
shaft and thought I good get the seal over it and work ...... wrong
answer)....... Pull it all apart........ try a bunch of different things
..... none work all leak ....... RMMW and a few other places don't carry
this seal, and plus I don't want to be here forever waiting on the mail. End
of day 2...... Day 3 .... not having anymore fun ....... more leaking fluids
all over ......... finally after much pounding get the metal thingy off the
shaft....... Take an old seal from the small lug discard pile and try to fit
it in place (this seal is not the same as big lug seal) anyways, If you put
the small lug seal just on the tip of where the seal is supposed to go, it
actually works and holds back tranny fluid.... Spent most of all day on
this..... Took Sunday off, had great fun at Arrowhead Stadium in the pouring
rain....... Day 4 ...... finished up all the tranny stuff, got the engine
ready to go back in ....... doesn't want to go all the way in .... hhmm....
pull it out, huh it looks like it rubbing the on some parts of the
transmission ...... look at the old one, sure enough it had been filed down
in some parts.....  get out a chisel and go to work ...... five trys later
it looks like it fits....... goes in all the way, tighten everything down,
hook everything up ...... engine won;t even turn over its in there so tight
..... back out more chiseling ...... and so on, till it finally went it
.........

So now the bus runs like a champ at 55 again ..... much quieter actually
(old tranny trying to tell me something before it died) and a much more
confident owner, not afraid to take on big repair jobs......I did this
mostly myself with some help from my girlfriend and great hospitality from
my aunt and uncle. Thanks to all those who offered help and instructions on
how to do this little project. It wasn't too rough, just took a little
longer than I thought... We shall be leaving tomorrow and heading towards
Colorado and after that who knows.... If you see an ol blue and white 66
with to smiling passengers and 2 bikes hanging off the back be sure to
wave........

Tim......

Oh and the shifting coupler that I broke, it being held together with a pair
of vice grips which are tied by string to the bus, just in case they fall
off.....
