Subject: Re: [VB] which shift lock?

yeah, i was told that they where an early ghia/bug lock.  but gabe has one
listed as fitting buses and there is a 51 bus with one installed in the david
eccles spec guide.
is a b/d shifter smaller than a 55-65?

  I'm not totally sure but I think the Wasco locks are early bug/ghia models.
I used the WW model in my bus which is modeled after #2 though you do have to
use a quick shift kit with it.
