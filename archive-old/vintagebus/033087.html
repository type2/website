&lt;&lt; No, you just don't have the shoes adjusted right on all the wheels.  Air 
bubbles tend to manifest as a change in pedal resistance.  No braking at all 
until the pedal's way down means the shoes aren't contacting the hubs until 
they've moved quite a ways.  &gt;&gt;
Hi Volks, 
Plus not having the shoes adjusted properly will not help in gettting all the 
air bubbles out!    Eric&amp;Barb
