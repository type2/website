Subject: Busbones revisited......one month later
Date: Wed, 28 Oct 1998 09:24:27 +1100

On the 25th Sept Kevin Murray of Busbones emailed
a 'parts for sale' post to the Ghia list which ended up
being cross-posted to the bus lists (and others).....

This caused some consternation amongst the bus
listmeisters (both present and past) because
Kevin was regarded as having a somewhat chequered
history, partly as a result of my (well-documented)
dealings...

Basically, some 18 months ago Kevin posted a similar
message to the bus list and I negotiated to buy certain
parts for my deluxe, sent Kevin a cheque and never saw
the parts or an often promised refund.  I actually gave
up chasing my money, until the latest post caused me
to comment to the list on this situation again (cc'd to
Kevin to be 'fair' as he's not on the bus list now..)

I received the reply below, which again is a nice email
and a promise to make good. I emailed him back the 
same day saying that I would like him to airmail
me a refund and I would really be delighted to straighten 
this out on the list.......

AND.....no reply and no refund (yet again).

I guess people may well be getting sick and tired of 
this saga, so to those of you who are I apologise.
But I work hard to earn my bus money, and I guess
I'll post once every time something like this comes up
 ............

Robert:

It is no easier to say this in writing, than it would be in person, and
either way it will still ring hollow in your ears I'm sure.

I remember a year and a half ago, when you were still in the states, we
transacted an agreement. I to deliver parts, and you to pay for the freight
and purchase price.

Through no fault of your own you did not recieve what you ordered, and yes,
as a matter of normal business we cashed your check promptly, prior to
confirmation by you that you had recieved what you ordered.

I owe you an apology without excuses.

I do not have, at the moment, copies of our previous eMailings, nor do I
remember with full clarity what it was you originally ordered, but if you
would clarify what it is you wish me to do at this point I will do whatever
I can, within reason, to comply.

again, I apologise for your inconvienance

regards

kevin murray
