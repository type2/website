If they sit for a while sometimes they get a little cranky. Have you checked 
the restart switch? With the fan facing you and the top off, there is a clear 
plastic &quot;box&quot; that has a red switch on the right hand side, push it it back 
and it should spring forward. I would also check the in-line fuse.

As far as the pump goes it has a set of points under the plastic cap where 
the hot lead connects. The point gap should be set at 1mm. connecting 12volts to 
the terminal and a ground to the body itself should tell you what you need to 
do with that. 

Restart switch is good. 
In-line fuse?  Enlighten me on where this might be located.  This could be my 
problem, but I don't see one readily visible.

I pulled the fuel line off and it was bone dry.

It ran for a few minutes last week and quit.

Thanks for the info
