Subject: NOS repro? Mettallurgy Q? 40hp fuel pump

Hey Volks

I recently scored a pair of &quot;NOS repro&quot; 40hp fuel pumps for the equivalent
of a few dollars. They are an identical copy of the stock Pierburg pump, but
instead of the Pierburg brand on the base it says &quot;MCR Torino&quot; in a
crennelated logo, with &quot;Made in Italy&quot; underneath.

I notice that the castings are cracked on almost all of the edges, the
cracks going quite deep into the metal. Is this a result of age or an
original casting fault? Are these things useable? The cracks look quite bad,
though the various parts all seem to be holding together. I found a used
MCR pump (slightly different design) among my parts stash and its casting
looked good. Anyone have any experience of this?

Another thing about these pumps is that they are covered by a plastic
shroud, looks like a heat shield. The shield is held on by a wire circlip
round the base of the pump. I notice on a used Pierburg that it has the same
channel for the circlip. Is this a heat shield against the dreaded 40hp
vapour lock, and were Pierburgs originally fitted with them?

That's quite a few questions for the list ...
