Subject: RE: [VB] Harry's amazing seat of cool

That's exactly what it is, cold water. Air would be 
great going into a helmet and suit, but I wear shorts 
and t-shirts. Thanks for the advice on the peltier 
devices, Scott. I've decided to use a network of storage 
facilities that will supply me with the heat absorbing 
materials at regular intervals. That means I'll buy ice 
at gas stops. 

There are racing suits cooled like this, just t-shirts 
with the tubing sewn on, they get $400 and more for 'em.

Biggest problem is that the circulating water is TOO 
cold! Condenses a lot of moisture out of the air like 
the outside of an ice tea glass. If I keep it at 60f it 
won't condense and also won't numb my back. Will test it 
in the back yard this weekend.

&gt; You could adapt this to cool a seat by running coils of flexable tubing
&gt; throughout the seat and pumping the cooled water instead of the cooled air.
&gt; The flexable tubing ahould not be felt under the padding of the seat. Kind
&gt; of like radient cooling.

&gt; Harry has a real neat idea here.  I've seen his &quot;contraption&quot; and if it 
&gt; works, he and karl should stay quite a bit cooler this year.  Hope for no 
&gt; leaks!
&gt; 
&gt; If Harry's water cooler works, he could keep the water cooler on the cold 
&gt; side with a big batch of peltiers used to cool the water.
