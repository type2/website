Subject: Re: [VB] FW: Early Door? whens the last time you oiled your hinges?

Wayne,
Easiest way to tell- Just look at the hinges. do they have a round hole
drilled on them on the backside for oiling, on the middle hinge finger? or
do they have a square notch on the upper most finger? Barndoor had the round
oil hole style. Since your pic is so poor quality, i cant tell if it even
has the whole hinge assembly, which in that case, the round hole hinges had
the hole drilled on the hinge part that attaches to the bus body, whearas
the square hole hinges had the square hole on the part of the hinge that
stays attached to the door if you pulled the pin on either style.

There is supposedly a jan55-feb55  '2 month only' sqaure notch door since
they supposedly started the square hole in december of 54, but me and many
others with Jan/Feb55's with original doors, have the round hole styles so
they prolly never got around to really implementing it until the new style
doors came out. That would be an ultra rare door if it does exist =)

&gt; Can someone look at this attachment and tell me if this is the early door
or
&gt; the later model?  I am a little dyslexic -- Which causes me to mistake to
&gt; very similar items.  I believe that this is the early 50-55 barndoor
driver
&gt; side door from the scalloped handle.
