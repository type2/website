That means you probably have a non-vented gas cap.

That is a bad thing, either get a vented one or drill a tiny hole in the
one you have.  I recommend getting a vented one as they let air in but
dont let air or gas out... 9 times out of 10 i have pressure in my gastank
as when the sun comes up it heats up the gas and it expands, but when i am
driving as the fuel is sucked out it is always replaced by air through the
vent.

take care,

Steve
