That's what I thought at first, since there
is what looks like an air horn under the passenger
side. I removed the pedal pan, to see, crawled
under and had my wife hit the horn button. The noise
is definitely coming from the left side. I tested the
wire going into the steering box, and it's hot.  The ground wire
from the horn does not go directly to the streering box. It goes
up into the front panel. The power wire to the horn
has no juice. The wire connected to the box does have
power. I know there has been some rewiring done, I just have
to pull the kick panel and see what's going on here. I would like to
get the air horn working if that's what it is. Maybe I can't drive so fast
but I can honk loud! :)

&gt;
&gt;Sounds like you have a compressor for an air horn wired in there somewhere.
&gt;Are you sure the thing the wire goes into is the steering box :) ?

&gt;&gt;&gt; ...when you push the horn button on my 62 westy, a loud whirring sound
&gt;comes out of the steering box. &lt;&lt;
