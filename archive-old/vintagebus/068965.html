Subject: Re: [VB] re: Keeps eating wheel bearings?

&gt; The front beam is actually from a '68, and it has that
 funky nut with an alan key to tighten it down.  Nice
 to work with, but I've noticed that the nut may have
 hit the inside of the (dented) cap, possbily causing
 metal shavings.  If anyone has one of these nuts, I'd
 appreciate knowing which side should be toward the
 washer, and which side toward the outside.  This time
 around I'm going to have the 'larger' side outward.
 
The small side [looks like a hex nut] goes outside, away from the bearing.

It shows up clearer in the 68-79 Bentley, section 2, page 8.
