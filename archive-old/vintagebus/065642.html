Subject: Going to Pomona??

I'm cross posting this in case T2 people have some T3 stuff :-) 




Anyone going to Pomona tomorrow that will be selling a CLEAN T3 (what
ever fits a '66) gas tank, would you please drop me a note so I can pick
it up from you there?  I've tried everything with this tank to no avail 
(even had the radiator shop go at it and they gave up). I'm also looking
for a good 6v? sender locally.  Thanks in advance.

For the bus crowd, what type of pressure sender do I need to get to fit
my T3 cooler (for the conversion) that will work with a VDO gauge.

Steve
