made it out to the bus rescue, with only a couple of problems,
 vw howards alt. went out in his chevy truck about 60 miles out of havasu,
 maybe before, we left at 4 am for this road trip, not to be stopped took
the battery out of corys fo#d van, put it in howards truck so we could
continue
our journey, vwhoward drove between corys for# and my f#_at_d truck without his
lights on to save battery, plus the sun would be coming up soon, got to the
first gas
stop, only my fo#d needed gas (why would they build a 4 wheel drive big V8
truck
and give it a 15 gallon tank when you get 8 miles per gallon) went to start
my truck
battery dead, gave it a jump and off we go again, a few hours later we pull
up to
the vw yard from heaven, lots of dirt and more dirt, looked through the
fence for
my 6 buses i purchased and saw 2 plus a line of bubbles and a vanagon, they
moved the wrong buses, but heck how would anyone know as there were so many
(buses)
there, started the loading procedure we had 3 trucks and trailers, generator
and torch set but never enough tools, got 1 loaded  complete 60's kombi
(fs)with a non bastard
36hp in it then looked at the complete sundial with wacked nose, we'll load
it later
then moved over to the others, loaded my early double door camper ( anybody
got
a couple of single pane pop out windows, without cranks, they have a notched
arm to
hold them out, need 2) got it on the trailer, looked at the other kombi,
parts donor
then moved over to the westy and single cab, removed all doors etc off the
westy
cut the roof off at the belt line, need the wood and the pop top opening for
a templete
for my 66 hardtop, soon to be pop-top walkthrough westy, and a guy from
hawaii
needs all the window openings to repair all his rusty windows, pulled the
tranny
then moved on to the single cab proceeded to cut the cab off of it, has
almost
perfect bed , corners and chest door,  then the cab had a good front end,
steering
gear and nose panel (bullet), this was a low mileage bus that drove under a
semi
trailer, the gates and engine lid were gone, then proceeded on a on the
ground parts hunt, and found a few items, all said we came back with 3 1/2
buses and i'm going back to get the sundial and the parts off the other
buses, every thing is going to be crushed thats left, but thay are moving
out the good stuff, not much left, then the drive home, everything went
smooth, looked cool on the highway seeing 3 1/2 on the rescue wagons, a lot
of thumbs up on the road, stopped to eat halfway back, my ford wouldn't
start again, jumped it, started, off we go again, almost to havasu the truck
starts acting up get all the way into town hit a red light truck dies, no
start, vwhoward and cory left me thinking i turned or something, as i'm
stuck on the major road through havasu, so i got
out the trusty cell, called my tow truck buddy, he got right there, gave me
a guick charge
followed me to my house truck died going down my street, coasted into my lot
next to house, lucky or what, a major road trip and broke down at my own
front door
good karma? even with a good alt. the truck wouldn't run with a bad battery,
the battery
feeds power to the computer on it, what's going to happen in y2k, put in a
new battery
problem solved

today the listy from the furthest showed up, drove all the way from hawaii
via a boat
then seattle, l.a. to havasu on to some god forsaken place back east, what
men will do
for a women, leave 80 degree year round to 4 seasons, nice to see another
listy and there bus, helped with a few parts, opened the shop on sunday to
help him out and off
he went with a smile and a long road ahead of him
