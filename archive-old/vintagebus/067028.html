Subject: Re: [VB] Wiper Arm Question

there are more than two versions.

the latest version the screw is a bolt sideways and pinches the base onto the 
wiper shaft.  the earlier ones the set screw screws onto the shaft.  the 
later ones are 65?  66-67 and work best.  These bases are larger as well.   
If you just want wipers, I'd used those.   

If you want to be anal retentive about correct wiper bases, I think we need a 
website, they are hard to describe, but pictures are easy.  Don't forget to 
get the right colour wiper.

&lt;&lt; I have several wiper arms laying around I pulled off busses. Some have a 
longer &quot;base&quot; than the others and are overall (tip to tip) about 1inch 
longer. 
 
 Question is, when did the wiper arms change?  Should a 61 have the longer or 
shorter ones?
