hose is a lot less than the cost of replacing your bus.

Do NOT install a fuel-filter in the engine compartment between the fuel pump
and the carburetor.

why not?  It seems to perforn an important function.   I haev seen them fill
up with stuff- easier the change one than clean out the carb.     Having one
between the tank and the engine compartment may be out of the way of
electrical stuff, but much harder to keep an eye on to see when it needs
replacement.     I always use hose clamps on the filter, it is under pressure,
actually all pieces on the &quot;out&quot; side of the fuel pump get clamps.   It is
more likely for the metal tube to pop out of the carberator than a filter to
leak or whatever.
