Subject: Re: [VB] Junkyarding Story

&gt;  I don't know what it is but there is this thing with people that 
&gt;don't know VWs to say that this VW or that VW was a special year.

I have seen this exact thing as well. REALLY turns you off. I don't 
know who they think they are kidding. A VW person is gonna know 
better and leave laughing. A non-VW person isn't gonna care. All the 
bugs or busses look the same to them. So it really does nothing but 
help the Vw to sit there and rust away.
