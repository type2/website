&gt; &gt;O.K. list, here's the situation.  I have a generator fuel pump that seems
to
&gt; &gt;be sealed, no way to open it.  I have suddenly developed fuel delivery
&gt; &gt;problems.  No fuel for a while and then fuel again later.  I have an
in-line
&gt; &gt;filter so I can see what is going on.  Is there any way to open this pump
up
&gt; &gt;and clean it out?  I'm sure that there is some type of blockage that
comes
&gt; &gt;and goes in there.

Clean the screen in your tank outlet and replace your fuel hoses.

The first is because that is quite probably the problem, the second is
because that is the right thing to do while you're at it. Only you can
prevent bus fires.....
