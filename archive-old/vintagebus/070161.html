Subject: Re: [VB] more engine tin &amp; now alternator question

the tin on drivers side looks to have been trimmed, usually you can tell
when you go to line up the screw holes that attach them. You can see the

rearmost tin. One thing that jumps out at me is the amount of RTV still left
on the case-gets into oil passages and does bad things.
