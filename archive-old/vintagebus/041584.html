&gt; During the 15 minutes or so at ~2000rpm, it developed a minor trail of oil
&gt; along the case, just to the rear (FIF) of the oil cooler.
&gt; 
&gt; Removal of the shroud and cooler sucked, this aftermarket (all tagged with
&gt; &quot;MADE IN TIAWAN&quot;) tin has .very. sharp edges.  And the rear seam on the
&gt; fan shroud does as well.  Turns out that the rearmost seal owas slightly
&gt; cockeyed in in the hole.  A 1 hr trip to my place to get new seals, (and
&gt; 
&gt; The holes in the fan shroud for the accel. cable tube seem to be slightly
&gt; off rom where they should.  With the shroud seated right, the tube hits
&gt; the oil cooler bracket.  And the hole in the firewall tin is even further
&gt; off, toward the drivers side.  1/2&quot; or so.  Makes for an interesting
&gt; install.
&gt; 
&gt; I mentioned no provision for the hoover bit earlier...I was wrong.  The
&gt; shroud does indeed have the slot for the bolt, but there is .no. hoover
&gt; bit installed.  They do have a (very) thin layer of foam glued over the
&gt; cooler..my personal prefernce lends to something a bit thicker here, for a
&gt; better seal.

I have never found any Taiwan tin that is anywhere near as good of quality
as the original VW tin.  I've spent a lot of hours brazing up original tin
when I could have just bought new, because I didn't want to go through the
hassles of modifying the new stuff to fit.

One of the worst problems I've found with taiwan cylinder tin is that they
lack the little dents that allow the flap levers to swing.  I wonder how
many engines have been fried by folks who didn't check their flap travel?

Your experience seems to reinforce my general negative feelings about GEX.
You've done more work on this one than if you had simply bought a
longblock and parts.  Slapdash work and cheap parts seems to be the norm
for them.

&gt; We seem to be getting a lot of .bubbles. in the oil. (up to now we

This might be normal.  The oil gets a lot of agitation in
the sump.
