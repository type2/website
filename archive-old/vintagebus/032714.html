I don't understand the fix.  When you disconnect the choke, the
engine starts.  But the position of the choke doesn't change because
all you've done is disconnect the heating element.  

I sounds to me like the choke heating element is grounding the coil
when the element is cold.  After you disconnect the choke, no more
ground.  Once the engine and carb warm up, the bi-metallic strip
moves slightly and the short no longer occurs.

&gt;Adrian,
&gt;
&gt;Sounds to me like your choke is adjusted all of the way shut, 
&gt;meaning no
&gt;air. Thus no spark, no fire.  I used to be a devout &quot;no choke&quot; kind 
&gt;of guy,
&gt;but my mechanic steered me toward the other way(This is for a stock 
&gt;carb
&gt;right?).  I now run a Progressive with no choke(Just because I 
&gt;haven't
&gt;looked into the correct way to set it up), but when I had the stock 
&gt;carb, I
&gt;followed these steps:
&gt;
&gt;Check to see if the choke is all the way closed when the engine is 
&gt;cold.
&gt;
&gt;1. make sure the power is connected correctly
&gt;2. With the engine cool, take off the air cleaner, and loosen the 
&gt;choke hold
&gt;down screws(3).
&gt;3. I believe there is a notch in the white choke body that needs to 
&gt;be lined
&gt;up with a hash mark on the &quot;hold-down&quot; ring.
&gt;
&gt;This forces the choke to close at a certain amount, until the engine 
&gt;warms
&gt;up and makes an internal spring inside the choke mechanism to grow, 
&gt;opening
&gt;the choke.
&gt;
&gt;I can get more specific when I get home, and take a look at my stock 
&gt;engine.
&gt;
&gt; - Hope this helps.

&gt;Subject: [VB] Choke n me out!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Here is a very odd choke problem I would appreciate some assistance 
&gt;with...
&gt;
&gt;When the vehicle is cold and the choke power wire attached it will 
&gt;not
&gt;start.  Pull the choke power wire off and it will fire up and run 
&gt;instantly.
&gt;Reattach the choke power wire and it runs fine like normal.
&gt;
&gt;I am stumped as to why this would happen?
&gt;
&gt;Right now I am leaning towards just disabling the choke altogether 
&gt;like St
&gt;Muir advises :)   I am not sure if this would affect drivability 
&gt;that much?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
