Hey all,

Just wanted to kick some gratitude for all the helpful replies.  I have 
readjusted the timing and he is doing better.  I failed to mention that my 
heat exchangers are clear and are wired completely open.  My heat is great!  
However on the way back from dinner in the original post my heat at the 
front vent was SUPER hot so i phreaked out and pulled over and did a 
dipstick test and he was cool as could be.  Seems when timing gets out my 
heat disipates the extra heat instead of my engine I guess thats a good 
thing.  However I drove my bus all summer w/ a shady deck lid seal and no 
engine bay seal whatsoever and my dipstick always stayed cool all summer on 
a full tank hot run on the high way.  I have a original oil bath w/ no pre 
heat tube....guess i should get one.  Have no knowlege of the thermostat 
flaps but will look into that as well.  I may have to drive him 500 miles 
one way up to central IN from SC for the holidays so I will explore all 
these variables brough to my attention.  Thanks again you all are great.

&gt; &gt;Friday nite went out to dinner and the bus did alright, on the way home
&gt; &gt;supper slugish loss of power and the outside temp was probably 50 degrees
&gt; &gt;(I'm in SC).
&gt;
&gt;Adjust your choke.  Let the Bus sit all night in its usual condition
&gt;(if you park it inside, leave it inside, etc).  First thing in the AM,
&gt;*don't start the engine or even turn on the key*, and go to back.
&gt;Pull your air cleaner off and loosen the three screws holding the
&gt;choke cover down (the round thing, usually on the right side, with
&gt;a wire going to it).  Pull the throttle lever back with your left
&gt;index finger so it is well clear of the fast idle cam and start turning
&gt;the choke cover back and forth with your right hand.  You should find
&gt;that one way opens the choke (that round plate in the top of the carb)
&gt;and the other way closes it.  (If it sticks, take the choke cover
&gt;completely off and hose down inside there and around the choke plate
&gt;with spray carb cleaner.)  Move the cover to where the choke just barely
&gt;closes and no further, and tighten the choke cover screws.  Put the
&gt;air cleaner back on and go up front to start it.  Come back and make
&gt;sure you have voltage (use your test light) between the electric
&gt;terminal on the choke cover and ground.  If no voltage, find out why...
&gt;probably a broken wire either at the choke cover or over at the coil
&gt;(this wire is hot with key on).
&gt;
&gt;You may find you have to readjust the fast idle with the screw in
&gt;the end of the throttle arm after doing this.
&gt;
&gt;Also, don't forget to readjust when the weather changes significantly.
&gt;
&gt;Good luck!
&gt;
