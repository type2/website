Subject: welding posts to inner rockers?
Date: Fri, 18 Dec 1998 12:52:14 +1100

Greetings,

In relation to Josh I must say that I am not very good 
at writing/relating my personal thoughts and feelings
and have struggled with the subjectand fear I could
be clumsy.  However, let me
say I feel 'strangely' effected and saddened and Josh
'travel well' wherever you might go.........

 I was visiting Metwiz's pages and had a look
at the work he is doing on Rob B's camper (very
nioce be the way).  See

http://members.aol_dot_com/METwiz2/page2.html

Anyway, I noticed that Metwiz
welds the bottom of the vertical 'posts' (vertical
bit that supports the panel on the side of the bus)
to the inner rockers.  I've never done this, and have
never seen them attached in this way in any of
the buses I have worked on (but on the other hand
they could have been attached and the evidence
has just flaked away with time...).  I always assumed
this was to allow a little 'twist to occur in the body...

Can anyone shed any authorative light on this?

Thanks

RobK
