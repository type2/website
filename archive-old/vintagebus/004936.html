I've owned a 71 beetle, (parts car) a 68 bug and a 70 Ghia. I was looking
for another Ghia or a thing. and I stumbled across this 59 panel. A friend
of mine had it and I got it for a sweet deal. At least I think that...... my
wife that is a different story.  My question is what should I do first? I
know I need to fix the Fred Flintstone action, but what should I start on
until I can afford to fix the pan? Thanks in advance
