Subject: '79-&gt;'60 Brake Swap; I have Brakes Again!

Some of you may remember my note about dealing with two runaway vehicles on
saturday, on of them being my '60 DC.  The seals gave out on the Master Cylinder
and the brakes went with the brake fluid, out.  I made out of it with no
vehicle/property damage and just a sore arm and chest, where I slammed into the
building (runaway #1)

Thanks to those who have pmailed notes of concern.  You can count on the fact that
I will never jump into a moving car again in attempts to stop it.  Let it go, just
let, it, go.

Since I have been gathering up parts for this swap for a while and had everything
ready to go, it made since to do the swap now, rather than fix the MC and then do
the swap in a few weeks when I out on summer break.

So,
I started with the beam from a '69 camper.  The camper went to someone else's
project for his handicap son in Hawaii.

In the junk yard I pulled the fronts off of a '79 Bus from the torsion arms out.
At the same time I also pulled the rear hubs off the same bus.  The entire set of
four wheels, hubs, brakes, wheels, tires, servo and hardware cost me $125.

I procured all the rebuild parts from Bus Depot and rebuilt the entire beam last
summer.  It has been sitting there waiting for me ever since.

Sunday afternoon, I headed over to Bill &amp; Steve's, and got the new hoses, a bunch
of brake lines and a few pieces of hardware that I needed.  At 4:30pm, I started
removing the old beam.

The old beam came out fairly easily, it would have been real nice if I had
remembered to remove the clutch cable.  Once the beam let loose and put tension on
the clutch cable, there was no way to reverse the process.  Out came the cable
cutters.  Got a new cable today and in it went.

I cleaned up the frame and gave it a protective coat of paint.  Once the paint
dried, I covered both the beam and the frame with a light film of wheel grease,
thinking it might make my alignment process a little easier.

It could not have gone up any easier.  In all of two and a half hours, I had the
old beam out and new one back in place.

Now came all the &quot;fun&quot; work.  I went through the calipers again, since they had
been sitting for a year.  Then went to work fitting the servo and at this point,
I'm a bit fuzzy on what else I was working on.  Suffice it to say, I ran out of
gas around 3:30am

Went back to the shop this afternoon after work and put in another 5 hours tending
to all the little details, checking tightness on everything, bleeding the brakes,
installing servo vacuum line and  safety wires where needed.

The first drive was surprising.

I was taken aback by the ease of braking and the stopping power.

My eyeball wheel alignment will do for now until I get new tires all around.  I
can let go of the wheel and it drives straight.   Stomping on the brakes, result
in a quick and straight stop.  I tried with very light pressure on the steering
wheel and had a nice straight stop with no pulling to either side.

Two things I have to fix/look into.

I have to hook up the speedo cable (was missing the outside cover that the cable
hooks to, I think its in my workshop somewhere) .  The right brake is making a bit
of noise, It sounds like the pad in need of seating in.  It goes away real quick
when I apply the brakes.

There you go.  Subtracting a couple of meal brakes, all total of 15 hours on this
project.
Having access to the lift help immensely, but having a second person, would have
sped that up too.
