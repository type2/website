&gt;Has anyone put Christmas lights on their bus with any success?

I put a couple of short strings of battery-powered Yule lights on 
my Ch_at_vy a couple of years ago.  I think I got them at Wal-Mart.
The strings were about 5 feet long with 10 or so lights on them,
and they took two &quot;D&quot; batteries.  I only ran them at night, and
I think I used two sets of batteries over the season.  One set
was inside the rear window and the other was out on the front
grille--I stuck the battery box behind the front license plate.

You could buy four sets of these, cut off the battery boxes, and wire
the strings in series to get a 12 volt set.

For a little more work, you can do the same thing with a regular 35,
50, or 100 light string.  Cut the 35-bulb string up into lengths of
4 bulbs, or a 50 light string into lengths of 5 bulbs, and wire
these lengths in parallel, to get a 12v set.  Usually the 100-light
strings are just two 50-light strings joined in the middle.

The inverter idea is probably the simplest, unless you have a 6 volt
Bus.  The inverter may also interfere somewhat with AM broadcast or
CB radio.

Good luck!
