Sorry guys, this has very minimal bus content, and on the surface might appear as a spam.  But all of you who know me realize that this couldn't be the case.

I've run out of decent bus parts to sell on eBay, so I've thrown up two of my treasured Coca Cola coolers to be auctioned.  I only need a few dollars more to guarantee that the Westy will now be painted, so I'm digging into the &quot;I love this but don't really need it&quot; boxes.

Anyway, the coolers are on eBay and us bus folk love an old cooler to compliment our vehicles, so check 'em out.  Sorry to say I had to put reserves on them.

Thanks for tolerating my auctions and advertising.  My ramblings I'm sure go unnoticed.

Robert
