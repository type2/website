Some friends of mine have been using the bases from their broken safari window latches as spacers when they install the new ones.  They swear by this.  Just grind off whatever is left on the base until it is just a flat piece of metal with the two holes in it.  Then put that under the new latch when you install it.  Less tension=less breakage.  We have some generic aftermarket rubber here the guys say is a lot better than the regular stuff.  It doesn't rain much here but they say it works well.  It has a metal reinforced channel that slips over the window frame (on the bus) and has a round squishy gasket sort of thing that is compressed by the window frame (the actual safari) when the thing is closed.  It was like $1.30 a foot at the local auto upholstry place (they also sell window rubber).  I could scan a picture if anyone was interested.
