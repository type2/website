Subject: Tie Rod fun!

Well the left side tie rods are easy at least :)

The right side (no adjustments) is completely baffling to me.

The right side tie rod ends look pressed or crimped into the tie rod.  How 
do the old tie rod ends come out?  Also it appears that there is no threads 
to screw into?

Thanks!
