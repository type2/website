Actually, CW is right, to some extent. Rather than
preventing the engine from reaching operating
temperature, it prevents the engine from reaching
operating temperature as quickly. In a cold climate,
this could conceivably mean the motor only reaching
operating temperature after extended periods, and
maybe not reaching it at all. 

I tested this theory by doing the following:

I drilled a hole in a sump plate, and fixed a digital
temp probe through the hole with some silicone. I then
attached this gizmo in place of the sump plate on a
motor without flaps or thermostat. 

I set a &quot;goal temperature&quot; of 170 degrees, a number
I'll admit I pulled out of my butt, but seemed
reasonable.

Started the motor, ran it at idle until this
temperature was reached. 

Installed a thermostat and flaps on the same motor,
and changed NOTHING else, and then ran the same test. 

I've since forgotten what the actual times were, but
the motor with the thermostat and flaps reached 170
degrees significantly faster than without. On the
order of 50% faster, but don't hold me to that, I
don't remember for certain.

&gt; Some conventional wisdom holds that lack of properly
&gt; working thremostat and
&gt; flaps keeps the engine from reaching proper
&gt; operating temperature. Check
&gt; your oil filler cap for a white foamy substance.
