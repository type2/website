&gt; Hey all,
&gt; I'm going to be picking up some middle seats soon, and I don't want them
&gt; to get beat around in the back of the truck...or up on the roof rack...
&gt; so I decided I'd take the bus and clamp them down as they were intended
&gt; to be.  Thing is...there are 2 seats.. and I only want to make one
&gt; trip.  If I take out the rear seat, can I put in a middle seat in its
&gt; place?  Will it fit ok?
&gt; This is in a 62 bus...and the seats are all splitty seats..

I don't know about the rear seat situation, but you could put both
seats into your bus facing each other.  Use a clamp on the normal &quot;rear&quot;
position to secure the front of the rear middle seat, and a clamp on the
normal &quot;front&quot; position to secure the front of the front middle seat,
which will be facing backwards.

got that?

Now explain it to me!  :)

    1    2   3        4

1 - stock rear seat, in stock position
2 - new middle seat, pushed back so that the normal rear clamp engages the
front of the seat base.
3 - new middle seat #2, positioned facing backward and clamped with the
front seat clamp.
4 - Front seats, the only ones that will actually hold people in this
configuration (at least people with legs!)
