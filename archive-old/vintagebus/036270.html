&lt;&lt; She feels it's time we own something that can tow any of
 our VWs if they breakdown.  There are 4 people in our family, so we gotta
 keep that in mind.  But I know a lot of listees have haulers that,
 naturally, we all stay quiet about. &lt;g&gt;  But give us some
 recommendations...what do you own? what do you like? &gt;&gt;

I towed my Barndoor from New Mexico to Missouri with an '85 Jetta.  Not the 
most ideal tow vehicle but it works in a pinch.  I think a VR6 Passat would 
be a great one.  If you are looking for something a little easier on the 
pocket book  any 60's - 80's full size station wagon would do the trick.
