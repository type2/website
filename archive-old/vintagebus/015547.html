Subject: Baltic Birch Panels
To: vintagebus_at_lenti.type2_dot_com

Jamie Auch advised all of us of a great source (Home
Depot) for 5' x 5' White Baltic Birch panels.
This is great but two things:

1.&gt; Double check the actual sizes needed for the
headliner prior to purchasing wood.
2.&gt; I have found two kinds of Baltic birch panels.
First is the kind that is all wood &lt;no masonite&gt; with
at least a 1/16&quot; of the Birch wood on both sides.
Supposedly popular with the &quot;scroll saw hobby craft&quot;
crowd. These folks need both sides to show for their
cut outs of animals or whatever. The other product
that I have seen and bought from HomeDepot is masonite
with a microscopic paper thin veneer of &quot;Baltic Birch&quot;
on one side only. It's great if it has been found in
5x5's I have only found it in 4x8's. Try to use all of
the same kind of material as I have found that the two
types as described above will stain differently. Do
tests of stain color to match between products.

Splitties use the 5'x5' and I don't remember if I used
the same size or the cheapie 4x8 stuff to redo the
interior (headliner)of a '83 Vanagon full-westy
camper. I think it was the 5x5. I have no experince
regarding the width span measurement of the bay window
headliner.
Good luck!
