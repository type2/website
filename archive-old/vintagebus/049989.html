Subject: Re: [VB] 66 only 6 volt gererator wanted

&gt;I am looking for a good used or rebuildable 66 only 6 volt generator for
&gt;my daily driver bus.  I have my reasons why I do not want to convert to 12
&gt;volt, so don't even try to sway me.
&gt;as long as I am asking, does anyone have any new or good used 66 only
&gt;voltage regulators too?
&gt;contact me off the list please.

&gt;currently putting out 5.34 volts and charging the battery every other day
&gt;in the Chicago area.


On this subject:

I've been accumulating parts for the eventual conversion of my '66 back to
6v.  I have a genuine Bosch rebuilt large diameter 6v generator (NOS in
Bosch box!), but I'm a bit stumped as to what regulator to use.  I bought a
NOS Bosch 6v regulator, a blisterpacked one on a bright yellow card, like
they used to sell in Checker Auto Parts and other places.  Now that I read
the fine print, I see that it's not the correct part for a '66 Bus.

Can anyone tell me the correct part numbers (VW and Bosch numbers) for the
regulator I need?

THANKS!
