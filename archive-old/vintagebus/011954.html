It's called trailing throttle oversteer.  Try decreasing the tire
pressure in the front tires to induce more understeer, or try
a heavier swaybar in the front.  It also helps to try following a
longer line into the turn, hitting the apex later.  Use more trail
braking to set the car up into the turn...

Oh wait, this is the *bus* list!

I'd check to make sure your tire pressures are correct, make sure
you're reduction boxes are tight, check the front end or slop or
bent components.  The tranny mounts in and of themselves wouldn't
do this.
