Besides, it's not a Mutant Honda like you were trying to connect here, don't

Don't you forget that the Volkswagen of today is NOT the Volkswagen of old...not even close.  That Volkswagen died stopped supporting the older cars and completely divested themselves from their past.  Well at least until they could exploit it for the NB.
