&gt; --- jim &lt;jiminwis_at_yahoo_dot_com&gt; theorized:
&gt; &gt; Moral of the story: Let the kids help, start them
&gt; &gt; young, even if they make mistakes; keep them
&gt; &gt; interested.
&gt;
&gt; I fully agree!  My older daughter (5 years old) can
&gt; tell the difference between a barndoor and a
&gt; non-barndoor bus

I agree with what you guys are saying, my 15year old son and 7 year old
&gt; daughter are both encouraged to get in there and at least try, no one
&gt; expects them to be perfect, and if I let my daughter polish the paneling
on
&gt; the inside of my Westy then she has something that she has accomplished
and
&gt; can feel like she has &quot;ownership&quot; of the bus just like her brother and her
&gt; dad. One of the worst things a parent can say is &quot;It's just easier to do
it
&gt; myself&quot;. Well, what does that teach your kid...that they're not worth the
&gt; effort to bring along? But we're missing the point here, that guy is just
an
&gt; a-hole, and if his 18 year old won't give the bus the care it
&gt; deserves...well who's fault is that anyway???
