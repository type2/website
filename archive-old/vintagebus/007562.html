&gt;Hi NQ,
&gt;NO.......  When in doubt with electrics ground the chassi/body of the item,
&gt;and apply positive to the wires!  Here is the wire ID for Saffire radios.
&gt;One for the positive to the radio.  One for the positive for the interior
&gt;light of the radio.  And two that should be together for the speaker.


Hot Dog!  Thanks Eric&amp;Barb.  I was excited to read this but figured I had
done my radio in by hooking it up wrong.  I didn't have enough time to work
on it this morning before I left for work but as soon as a delivery came up,
I grabbed it so I could run by home.

I hooked up the black and blue wires to the positive lead (after the
resistor drop) and the negative lead to the chassis grounding post on the
back.  I hooked up a wire for an antenna, and used another speaker I had
grabbed out of the electronics junk box.
I flipped on the switch, the lighted dial came on, and bingo, the speaker
was abuzz with radio static!  Tuning around a bit, I pulled in the local
radio station and heard some old muzak crap but man, I couldn't believe it!
This radio has sat unused since about 1980 and it works!!!

So you know what I'm going to do tonight?  I'm gonna wait until after dark,
then go out to the shop and shut the garage door, turn on the Sapphire, turn
off the shop light, and sit there with nothing but the glow of my propane
heater and the glow of the Sapphire while listening to some AM station with
it's static speldor.  There's almost nothing better to do on on overcast
October evening. :-) Oh and what makes it even better - that it's a 6v
radio - cool!!!

I'll get some pictures of this whole thing if I can.

NQ
