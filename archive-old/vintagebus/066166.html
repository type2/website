Subject: South-West area camper warning

http://www.rangemagazine_dot_com/stories/fall98/caught_between.htm

Just an interesting article about wolves and camping.  All you VW camper 
people in the south-west just keep an eye out when with little kids.

Anyone who thinks that wolves around farm animals or human children is safe 
you have a lot to learn.  I hate to see some of these tree-hugger groups go 
off half cocked like that, it only discredits thier own position in the main 
stream where they could do the most good.

Anyway just be careful especially with kids (read: prey).

Take Care,
Adrian
