  So anyway, on Wednesday I came home from work and ground the caliper
casting until it no longer interfered with the wheel. Straight forward, no
complications, easily done. No one around to help me bleed the damn brakes!
Rolled Rosie back into the garage until Thursday.
  On Thursday, my good friend Chris showed up to assist with the brake
bleeding. Started at the front just to get some fluid into the calipers,
then moved to the right rear to begin the actual procedure. Opened the
bleeder screw while Chris pumped the pedal. Nothing! The brakes were working
just fine before, what could be wrong. Possibly the connection at the MC?
Moved to the left side and tried again. Ah, fluid!  At least it's not the
MC. Moved back to the right side and tried again. Still nothing. Removed the
bleeder screw and probed with a small wire. Nichts! Disconnected the brake
line at the cylinder, still nothing. Disconnected the line at the upper end
of the flex hose. Fluid at last! Flex hose so bad it  wouldn't allow fluid
through under pressure. And yet the brakes had worked fine just a week
before. Called the local FLAPS and, wonder of wonders, they had the flex
hoses in stock! Drove down and picked up two (do them both now, you're under
there anyway) and drove back home. Replace both hoses while Chris and Carmen
entertain each other on the surface. Now, back to the bleeding. Do it all
again, this time with positive results. After the full bleed, there still
seems to be more pedal than I would like, but perhaps a little time and some
use will coax the last of the air out of the lines. Time for a test drive.
Put everything in the garage, fire up Rosie, and off we go. A short drive
around the block, several stops, some normal, some hard, reveal that the
brakes are working smooth and straight. Chris reminds me that until the pads
are broken in, the braking will not be all that impressive. Happy to have
them working at all.

Will report further after I have had time to fully evaluate
