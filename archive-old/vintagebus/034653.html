Hi Volks,
Good points.  Also take turns slower than normal.  When we tow type 1s with 
our split screens you forget due to it being so easy on the straight parts of 
the road.  You have to pay attention, and keep reminding yourself that you 
are towing so you do not come up to a stop light, curve, turn or stopped 
traffic ahead to quickly!
