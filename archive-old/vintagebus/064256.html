Subject: Re: [VB] Tips on nose replacement needed

Nose was hit on the driver's side mostly and that's where all the mess is. &quot;A&quot; pillar has not been
fixed right..... as Ronnie described it &quot;A-pillar was sculptured out of bondo&quot; so it clearly can not
hold the weight of the door.... hinges were bent for some reason. I think that I should just take
nose skin off to inspect it further. &quot;A&quot; pillar has to go - easier done when nose is off.... and
then it will be a lot easier to measure everything out to make sure door fits right.
right?

It's not just about driving it no matter what. I enjoy my Bus a lot but I would also like it to be
&quot;perfect&quot;. It just doesn't feel right for me when I know there are things that are wrong with it. It
must look good, perform well for me to feel good in it.

| If the nose skin is crumply AND the frame around it is bent, it makes sense
| to replace the skin and frame in one fell swoop.
