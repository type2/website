Subject: Damage done by loose heads?

After hearing the muir engine sounds, I'm looking at loose heads as the 
culprit of the sounds I've been hearing.  I'll be investigating fully, 
and torquing them tonight to spec if they're loose, but I'm just 
curious as to what damage is caused by running the engine like this, as 
the p.o. had this dc registered for the past year before I bought it.

-Thanks
Don
