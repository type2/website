&gt;I am trying to get my semaphores hooked up but can't find out where
&gt;the wiring runs to and from.

There is a wiring diagram at http://vintagebus_dot_com/wiring/bus-57-61-euro.jpg
but I think you are asking about the physical routing of the wiring.
I would _guess_ that it goes up the B pillar, along the roof, and back
down the A pillars to behind the dash, but I don't know for sure.

&gt;Is it natural to have to use force?

I don't think so.  The one I've had in my hand (off the car, from a
Bug) could be opened fairly easily by hand and as far as I know it
wasn't broken.

For some reason I think you probably have a copy of this message
already, but Thom described getting into a semaphore in
http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/vintagebus/057327.html .
