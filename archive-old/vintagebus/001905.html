Subject: loud wiper motor

Hi List,
Hope everyone's well. The wiper motor on my 63 DC is all of the sudden
extremely loud. Is there anything in particular that I can look at to see
what the problem is? The truck has been converted to 12v and so has the
wiper motor.

Besides all that, I'm hoping that some day I can make the trip to Jerome. It
sounds like alot of fun and I'd like to meet some of the ol' bus people that
I read about. It sure would be a long trip from the East coast of Oklahoma
though. Do people travel that far to Jerome?? Gotta go. Thanks again list!!
Pete
63 DC, Buck
