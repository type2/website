BAck many years ago (about 15)there was a local Recycler and parts supplier(and I use that term lightly,more like paying over dealer list)in the Detroit area going by the name Recycled Bugs and he got hit by VW so he became The parts Place for all Volkswagens and got hit again and has finally settled on The Parts Place.He fought VW doggedly each time and lost each time.So this has been going on for a very long time.

I received a certified letter today that said im a bad boy because I am 
using the word BUG. It looks like they are saying they OWN that word. Anyone 
had this problem? I wonder if they are going to go after Disney world for 
making the movie....A BUGs Life ?
