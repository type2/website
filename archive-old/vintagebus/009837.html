The fuel fittings for outboard motors are the &quot;dry break&quot; type, and are very
inexpensive.  When the connections are locked together, the hose will fail
before the connectors will pull apart.

Different manufacturers have used different designs over the years, but
they're all very durable and you can use whatever setup you want if you're
building your own system.

The older Mercury/Mariner fittings are metal, and very robust.  Some other
systems use plastic or nylon for their fittings which would not fare as well
in a high heat environment.

A valve at the tank outlet would allow flow to be stopped while lines are
replaced.  I asked quite a while back about a fitting that would allow a
valve to be mounted directly to the tank, but never saw a response.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt; You might also want to check out the &quot;dry break&quot; quick-disconnects that
allow you to disconnect the fuel lines.  The connectors automatically seal
themselves when you disconnect them.  They are available from
racing suppliers, AFAIK.

My problem with the disconnects, valves, etc. is that I usually replace
rubber lines while the engine is out.  No matter what kind of valves I have
in the system, I'm still going to have to open the lines to replace them.
The only solution I can think of is the old-style reserve valve on the tank.
