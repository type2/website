&lt;&lt; Will a later 3.88 bug R&amp;P go in the  tranny reasonably 
 painlessly and work with the existing ratios to be nicely driveable 
 with a sought top speed of 60 mph with the early reduction boxes?  &gt;&gt;

In my 1959 Westy with small nut reduction boxes and (I believe) a 4.12 rear 
ratio, I got a ticket this weekend for 65 in a 55 (oops!).  Stock single port 
pulls just fine and wants to go faster than the indicated 60 (actually 65) 
with 205/75R15's.  Also, Clara, in 90 degree temps this weekend for a short 
(150+ mile) jaunt, the oil temp never got over 210 at 90 degree ambient temps.
