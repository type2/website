&lt;&lt; Jon is good folks and would charge a fair
 price.  I keep thinking of that bearing puller though.  &gt;&gt;

Yeah, it's a lot of money, but if you compare what Hazet tools cost to 
Snap-On, it's amazing.  Not everyone loves Hazet, but I've been real happy 
with what I have gotten.  

Also, I'm not sure the bearing puller is a Hazet tool.

Hope to see you soon, John!
