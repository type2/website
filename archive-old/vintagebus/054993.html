Subject: Re: [VB]Factory Tools (Clamp for Red. Box and spring plate...)

Does the &quot;local manufacture&quot; only cover tools that are supposed to fabbed =
locally via a pattern (as the name would imply), or does it cover all =
those crazy items that pieslinger (sp?), matra, gedore etc. made specifical=
ly for vw over the years?

Thanks

&gt;I knew that it wasn't on VintageBus.  I haven't been able to find it, =
anywhere.


Odd. The Obsolete AirCooled Documentation Project IS on VB, but the Local
Manu is only reported as &quot;waiting to be scanned.&quot;

Anyways, on Thom's site click on the &quot;NEW! PARTS MANUALS&quot; link and get the
other docs in the program  :)
