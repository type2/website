Hi Daniel,
The M-code plate was installed in 1961 and later buses on the front side of
the bulkhead behind the passenger seat on bench seat buses.  On walkthroughs
they are on the right side of the overhead air intake vent.  On the SO-34 &amp;
SO-35 Westies built from 1961-65(?) the plate is under the passenger end of
the flip bench seat bottom.  So you might have to look a couple of times to
make sure you plate is not in other places, or better yet take the front
interior out and clean thoroughly.  This should turn up the M-code plate
location one way or another.  Eric &amp; Barb
