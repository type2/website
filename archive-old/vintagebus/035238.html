Find the oldest glass shop in town, bring the frames , let the owner see what 
you are trying to do .....
they have years of experiance making things like this work, 
and they have there own rubber seals.....

or maybe I am just lucky and have a great 80year old guy who owns my local 
shop, 
he even cuts me side window glass when I need it  and gets it tempered........
