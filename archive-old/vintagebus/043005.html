I have mor things hidden away in my bus than VeeWee listed, and my bus is
the most maintained unit on the road. I have all this space! And that is
what I fill it with. The feeling of security I have when I start a 3000
mile trip can't be matched by any diligent maintenance. What about the
poor guy who I stop for who needs something I happen to have? 

No such thing as overkill in my book. As long as I can hide it away in
some orderly fashion - in it goes!

A wire broke off inside my distrib once in Pasadena while it was raining,
a mile from home. I popped in a previously tuned spare, with bracket - one
13 mm nut and I was on my way. Love those spares! Three bucks at the
Irvine Classic.
