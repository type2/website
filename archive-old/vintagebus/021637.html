&lt;&lt; Do you feel a pulsing in your brake pedal when you step on the brakes?  
 That's a big hint that the drums need turning.  Maximum allowable drum 
 diameter can be found in your Bentley, mine's in the Tinkertoy and not 
 r &gt;&gt;
I am not sure what that pulsing feels like.

for a reminder, the bus pulls to left when you step on the brakes.  
inspection of the front wheel revealed non leaky cylinders, good front hoses, 
has new in spring M C, clean fluid.  adjusted and bled well.  all in all it 
looked good.  which is confusing- so why does it pull?   I had put all new 
hoses in when I goit the bus about 4 years ago, I took the front ones off teh 
other day, they were still clear inside, so I put them back on.   new shoes 
in front a year ago- I had a leaky front wc then a rebuildt the front and put 
new shoes on.   nothing looks wrong.  had a friend press on brake pedal with 
right drum off and I saw the pistons push out of teh cyls, and they snapped 
back.   I hear them do that. in the wheel when the brakes are pumped.  but 
louder on the left. 
 lying underneath I can reach the brake lever with one hand and spin &gt;the 
&gt;tire with another (when it is jacked up) and it seems the right &gt;wheel just 
&gt;doesn't stop so good.   which makes sense with it pulling &gt;left.

SO maybe the right springs are weaker, but that would not make them not stop. 
 I think I will try the turning.
