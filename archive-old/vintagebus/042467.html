Subject: GL4 saga comes to fruition
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.10.10003311311591.19356-100000_at_users.anet-stl_dot_com&gt;

well,

I had originally posted that jiffy lube had GL4 in 75-80 weight.  I called
them to check this as thats too light and had em look at the drum.  It was
80-90... Guess they dont sell it too often.  I probably had em check 3
times just to be sure, they were very helpful given the small size of my
purchase.  More helpful than i had any right to expect (given that i'm
such a pain in the ass sometimes. When it comes to VW's i tend to be
persnickety in my own way.)

Anyhow, i now have a gallon of high quality pennzoil gl4 80-90 tranny lube
for a whopping $6.80.  I am extremely happy with this outcome :) I can put
into my transmission that which volkswagen has deemed appropriate.

And to those who offered to buy a gallon or so at pep boys and mail it to
me, my heartfelt thanks :) 

take care,

Steve

p.s. as i mentioned before you have to bring your own container... Make
sure its clean
