If I take off the stock overhead vent plate, cut a couple holes in it, mount 
some directional vents from a 80ies DODGE van at the junkyard, I bet I could 
break even! ;-) (INCLUDING SHIPPING!!!!!!!!!)

Seeing as there's another deluxe next to this one, I'm guessing he stripped

this one for parts, and put the shell up on ebay.  Clever trick - someone

else has to deal with disposing of the carcass!


The bidding is _at_ $500+, but I can't see $500 worth of parts on this car,

even if you cut the whole thing up and ebay'd it a piece at a time...
