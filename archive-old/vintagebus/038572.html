&gt; Hey everyone--
&gt; Any creative people have some good ideas of what I should do w/ the interior
&gt; of my restored '59 panel? I had a SO-42 westy interior that I was gonna use,
&gt; but it was for a wide hatch bus so I sold it to someone who needed it for
&gt; their westy... 
&gt; Right now it's grey metal (stock), but I want to have something a bit more
&gt; user friendly which looks Really nice to compliment the rest of the bus!
&gt; This may be a bit off topic, but i'd love some ideas!!!
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks alot-Pete

You should build a booth-type setup with a camp box built into the rear
bench (above the engine compartment) containing stuff like a stove, sink,
and maybe a top opening fridge. The booth could have a table that extend
from the wall and sits down flush with the benches to make one big bed.
here's an illustration:
                _____               __
  back of bus&lt;--|    \    _____    / |
             ___|____ \___  |  ___/  |--&gt;front of bus
             |  ___  \   |  |  |     |
             | /   \  \__|_____|_____|


I was going to do this in my Dormobile, but I decided to make a side-facing
bench that runs the length of the bus, behind the driver's seat. This way I
can rebuild snd use my original Dormobile campbox that sits above the
engine. The bench seat will flip out to make a double bed with the back
cushion.
