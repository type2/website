&gt; The &quot;vintage plate&quot; rules are different in every state, but I can't
&gt; think of a single state that would let you have a different plate on 
&gt; the front than the back, vintage or not, show or not.  I saw a 930
&gt; in Carmel one time with a standard serial plate on the back, and
&gt; a personalized plate on the front; I wonder how long he'd been doing 
&gt; *that*!

A few states do not require a front license plate, so owners can put
whatever they please on the front.  Often the state will issue a front
plate with some catchy statement like &quot;Arrive Alive&quot; to use on the front.
