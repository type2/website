Last week end I finally finished up the 1600 as a replacement motor 
in my 1961 221. I had a few problems to sort out but nothing too 
severe. First off, the generator in the new motor was dead. So I had 
to do a quick swap to set that right.

Next, he cold snap that hit Denmark on Tuesday gave very rough 
running: icing of the carb. I had tried to clean out the manifold 
preheater pipe during this engine build but apparently wasn't too 
successful. So I looked through a few back issues of VolksWorld and 
found the add for the IMDU. This device could be described as an 
electric blanket for mice. It also looks like a little blood pressure 
cuff that just fits nicely around the manifold neck below the card 
and has a 12 volt heating element that draws power from the 
carburetor's choke.

Called to England and spoke with the fellow behind this little 
device. Sorry but in my haste I didn't get his name. Anyway, within 3 
days the little electric blanket was in my hand and as promised it 
took all of 15 - 20 minutes to set up. The IMDU was an immediate 
cure. All the stumbling was gone and the engine has been purring 
since. The good folks at IMDU set me back about 30 pounds in all, 
which in northern euro prices seems reasonable (24.95 for the IMDU 
and about 5 for shipping). The fellow who makes this device has been 
trying to get a web page up though isn't quite done, so I called him 
directly at +44 115 976 3129. I can only give this fellow a 
supporting endorsement. It worked as promised and for the price has 
saved me an engine pull and a hunt for a replacement manifold.

By the way I did a quick search at the Bus Depot but couldn't see the 
IMDU listed.

The photos of the Eriba that I posted drew a big response. I've found 
another eight pictures and local adds of other 50s and 60s trailers 
common in these parts. If you're interested take a look, just follow 
the leads to Eriba.
