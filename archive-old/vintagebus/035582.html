I had a problem in my 67 where I had flickering lights and it wouldnt start 
very often at the switch and would sometimes just competely die while driving.

One day on the way home of the freeway at 2 in the morning my lights went out 
and the bus died.  Pulled over and checked everything out.  Ended up being 
the headlight switch had a broken terminal inside.
