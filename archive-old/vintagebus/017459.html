Do you non-California folks get to opt for &quot;vanity&quot;
(i.e. personalized) plates?

We get seven spaces.

I'm going to be registering my former Wyoming (thanks
Ginger) bus in a couple of weeks and I'm contemplating
the plate. It's a 21 window 1967, gonna be titian
red/beige grey

What do you think?

Beats me. 
ANd I suppose I have to do the bumper sticker thing
now. I had a 66 bug, lowered and all primer in the
80's (I was 17). It had a Jesus fish where the &quot;1300&quot;
emblem goes on the decklid, but the license plate
frame said &quot;play with my dick, not my mind&quot;. 

Yikes. The stupid things we do when we're young.
I blame the era. Too much Miami Vice and Beverly Hills
Cop II. It got ripped off one day.
