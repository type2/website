Hey Kevin, thats a great colour.  What you can do it take the code L380 and 
the word Turquoise down to your local good auto paint store.   The one I went 
to had the old mixing codes.  I did this to get BlueWhite and Velvet Green 
from the PPG place.  I have seen PPG turquoise, it's good.  You could also 
take a sample of colour, from some where that was out of the sun.

 Hey all,
 
 I have a 63' panel, and I am looking at all of the color options for that
 year.  I have decided upon L380 Turquoise.  Anyone know how to tell a paint
 shop what color I am looking for, in terms they will understand?
 
 Thanks for any insight.
