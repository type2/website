Check the wire for a short somewhere.  Also another indicator is if you
disconnect the wire from the sender and the gauge still reads full then the
wire is grounding somewhere.  A good location to do a quick visual check is
where the wire passes up through the body into the tank area.

Subject: [VB] Fuel sender question...


Does the fuel sender need to be replaced during a 6 to 12 volt
conversion? I'm trying to figure out why my fuel gauge pegs to full when
I turn on the key.  A 6 volt sender on a 12v system seems reasonable
since I've tried multiple gauges. Any ideas?
Thanks as always!!!
