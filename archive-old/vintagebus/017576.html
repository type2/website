Subject: Double cab rear seat belts
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I'e been thinking about this  for years, and may
actually do something about putting rear seat belts in
my 65 double cab in the near future.
Has anyone done this, and if so, what is the best
method to use?  I did some looking in the archives but
found nothing useful.

Any suggestions would be appreciated. I  want to make
as little change to the truck as possible.
