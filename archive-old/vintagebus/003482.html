Subject: Horn Button Clocks for buses
Date: Sat, 29 Jul 2000 21:18:14 -0500

I've met a guy in Witchita, KS who won an ebay bid from me a while back.
We've been in touch and it seems this guy is quite the bus accessory maker.
I've encouraged him to join the list.  Here's an excerpt from his message to
me:

===================================================
Have three heaters, various conditions, will look tomorrow to see if I
can get some numbers off them, a couple are a kind of tube shape which
looks like it should fit into the driver's side opening next to the
engine.

When a friend had a broken horn button, the black part, I was switching
my plain black for a Wolfsburg crest button from an early bug and so
swapped him out the button.  Next borrowed the button back, went to a
friend who's a dental tech and had him make me a mold out of some king
of a rubber silicon stuff, a perfect mold of the face of the button.
Then cast them in dental acrylic, very strong stuff.  Next cut out the
proper sized hole to accomodate the clock, a push in battery operated
kind, silver bezzel, if that's what they call the trim ring, and a white
face with regular numbers, 1, 2, 3, etc.  The clocks are around an inch
and a half or so and seem to be just about the perfect size.  If anyone
needs to reset it or change the batteries, a finger nail will pop it up.
Personally I'd originally put a clock in a suicide wheel spinner but
kind of like it in the horn button a bit more.

While on the subject of stuff I've been working on, found a kind of
vallet, out of a kind of rayon, or something like that, material, black,
with velcro on the back which fits the angled space in the roof vent
perfectly.  I've had on on my bus for a couple of months and it's
perfect for holding your sunglasses, wallet, registration, etc.  If
anyone's interested I've got about 5 of them ready to go.

Am also working on a cassette tape holder which will fit in the parcel
tray just below the radio.  After a couple of attempts have determined
it will hold around 12 tapes, 15 tapes was just too far for my short
arms to reach.

If you know anyone interested let me know as I'm making them out of wood
so they'll look nice.

Also have some of the steering wheel spinners with the VW logo inside.
Have one on my bus and just love it for whipping around those corners.
I mounted mine on the upper top so that when I'm driving straight it's
out of the way, got about 5 of those too.  My buddy told me it should
have a pinup girl in it, but don't think the wives would appreciate it
as much as he seemed to think.

Well, enough babbling, if anyone's interested just let me know.  BTW,
have a few little bus face pins, acrylic, 4 different colors, blue,
green, red and yellow.  About an inch across, either a magnet or a push
back pin.  Put a magnet on mine and it sits just in front of the
steering column under the speedo.

Take care, cya.
=================================

I'll be posting his email address for any interested parties after I secure
my own spinner knob, &quot;vallet&quot;, and horn button clock. :-)
If anyone is really interested, I will forwad your messages to him and let
him contact you. :-)

Later!
