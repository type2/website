Subject: My Factory Data Sheet
Mime-Version: 1.0

Ooooh *squeal* I was so excited yesterday when the mail lady managed to
shove my factory data sheet thru the mail slot!

It pretty much confirms everything I already know about the Bus...funny
that they can't identify M-code 425...isn't that the seat belt mounting
points?  My bus (1139075) was built on July 3, 63 and hungout with his buds
for a couple days before leaving the factory on July 5th bound for
Jacksonville, FL.  I'm amazed to learn I still have the original engine
case and it is an optional 1500cc!  But a recent trip to the shop revealed
three stripped head studs, so I doubt I'll be able to use the case again.  :/

Just had to share the freude. :)
