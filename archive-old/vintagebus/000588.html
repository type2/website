&lt;&lt; I was reading through my old Hot VW's and found in June 1981 a section
 on building a &quot;water injection system&quot; for an aircooled vw engine. &gt;&gt;
Hi Jack,
We have talked about doing something like this for summer heat long hard 
trips.  If you ever have gone through a hot spell and suddenly driven through 
a rain shower with gauges.  You engine oil temp drops and the power does go 
up!  All those droplets of water helping to cool the engine surfaces.  The 
real question is wether water mist gets through the stock oil bath air 
cleaner to be turn into steam when the air/fuel mixture is burned, or is it 
just a matter that the air has been cooled and thusly is more dense.  Not a 
huge increase of power but a definite bit.  The idea of ours would be to 
install a machinists cooling spray system on the non-battery pan and use it 
only during the hot summer weather.  That way you can see if it would help to 
cool the engine more, get a bit more HP all while not having to modify any 
engine parts.   Eric&amp;Barb
