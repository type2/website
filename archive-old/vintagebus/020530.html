To: VWlist &lt;vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

I keep promising myself that I am going to lay back
and quit posting to the list. It drives me nuts to not
see the answer or close to the correct answer
posted...
---------------------------------------
Stock Westy config is to use special &quot;T&quot; bolts with
the top of the T on the floor inserted into the seat
slots. Length of this bolt is long enough to extend
from the floor up through metric equivalent of .5&quot;
plywood plus the thickness of the vinyl flooring and
the thickness of the base of the Z-bed base cabinet.

Yes, use washers similar to fender washers with innner
diameter holes to accomodate diameter of the T bolts.
Seat belts in the back were mounted via stock mounting
holes/nuts welded as part of the body.
Use caution if thinking about drilling holes through
the rear most quasi-vertical surface by the seat back.
**Remember that there is a gas tank right on the
otherside of that surface (give or take a minor
distance)!!!**
