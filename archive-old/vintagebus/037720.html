If the bus is totally rust free, and dent free why do you want to paint it?

I wasn't the one to post originally, but the main reason I painted my 65 westy
was to keep it sealed up against rust (and cause it had real ugly paint).  The
body was in better than average shape for this area, actually.  My 59 SC needs
paint- to keep it from rusting, it is primer outside, with surface rust
showing through in places.   But a lot of work, time money energy.   but
Hooray for painting buses.     AN unexpected side benefit was that other
drivers beame much more courteous.

I dont know that sandblasting is good, (warpage?) not that I know much about
bodywork, but I would sand the nose to bare metal, as it will probably have a
million tiny rock chips with spots of rust starting to creep under the
original paint.    On my bus we used an air powered longboard on the sides,
roof, etc - 80 grits then 180 grits sandpaper.
