Subject: Hello and Parts for sale

Hi Everyone,
  
  I've been a long time lurker here, used to be more active ages ago but  when I sold my VW's to make way for the progression of life I my emails  trickled away.  And as life has progressed my inventory of  parts  sat waiting for me in my parents house.  Well they are  selling the house and I have no idea if there will be time for a VW  project (or at least on a large scale) in the future so I'm looking to  get rid of everything.  For the most part I've worked on 69-71  campers so that's what most of the parts are.  Everything is  located in Lawrenceville NJ (near Princeton).  I'll be up there  moving them out Aug 5-6 and would like to had them over for a decent  offer.  Here is a partial list (I know I can't remember  everything).
  
  Interior wood panels
  front bumper
  lights and lenses
  set of pistons and jugs*
  long block*
  dash with gauges
  sliding door
  2 louvred (sp?) windows
  4 rims
  2 tires (New)
  engine mount bracket
  stool
  tent that attaches to side of camper (excellent condition)
  engine lid (at least one)
  the little piece of body that slides in after the engine (at least one)
  back door (at least one)
  glass (back door, side back windows (with vent window), and front doors (I think those are still there)
  gear shift (new)
  
  There are a lot of odds and ends as well like a new 1300 cc muffler and  various beetle, and squareback parts.  I'd like to get rid of  everything as a whole and not sell separate pieces here and  there.  If you're interested please let me know
  
  Erik Burtis
