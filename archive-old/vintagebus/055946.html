Subject: Re: [VB] re: Tent

Just one more note on the tent. issue... I have a friend in Minnesota who is
the third owner of a C42 ( no tent or rack )Westfalia. The original owner
had 5 kids and this Westfalia was purchased with the tent and correct
aluminum brackets. He has talked with the one of  the sons of the original
owner who has confirmed this.

A club member here in Fresno, Vince Corral,  is the original owner of a '67
HT Westy that has the brackets on the roof for the big tent, but has only
had the foyer tent.
Not sure of the M-codes, he'll be at BYOB and we can check them out. He's
easy to spot, velvet green with a Dormobile top that was installed in
Germany when he picked it up for a year long tour of Europe. It's been
completely resto'd with the unused brackets reinstalled and the same cracked
passenger windshield that appears in dozens of snapshots of the tour.
