&gt; &gt; I have been wondering the same thing.  The only problem I've
discovered is the
&gt; &gt; options for colors is far more limited with p.c.  I figured the
options were to
&gt; &gt; p.c. the bumpers and rims (should be the same color, silver white
right?) or
&gt; &gt; paint.  I can get the right color paint, but not the right color
p.c.  If you can
&gt; &gt; find silver white in a p.c. color, please let me know.
&gt; 
&gt; Contact WORCO Powder Coating.  Their list of colors is longer than I
have ever seen
