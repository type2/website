&gt; &gt; i have figured out all of the codes except for 374 and figured that was the

&gt; I think you're probably right.  My 1961 Flip-seat Westy has an m-code of 347 
&gt; which I don't find listed, but it must be a group of codes (like m-367) 
&gt; because there are things about the flip-seat camper which aren't covered by 
&gt; the rest of the codes.  For example, the front left pop-out is installed 
&gt; backwards (hinge on the front) from every other pop-out I've ever seen except 
&gt; on SO-34's.


Hmmmm.  374, eh?  My 66 so-44 has this.  (german delivery to a US soldier
stationed ther for a dozen years...small poptop, side tent, and he gave
the OE (from what my liturature says, included with all so-44 kits..)
roof rack BACK to the dealer cause he didnt want it..as per the original
owner whom i got it from..)

This bus ALSO has both the left and hte right front popout's backwards.
both open witht he opening toward the front of the bus.

Hmmm.

FYI heres my plate...

16 2
374 025 036 119 181
 2312 523320 6106935

titan red, beige gray...

I decoded this once, and iit matched what i know of the bus...but i forgot
what was what, soo.;)

anyway, gas heater, locking column, etc...

later...david
