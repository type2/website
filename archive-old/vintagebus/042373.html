&gt; Seat belts are a MUST (feelin STRONG today).  Think

I have a friend that was in a 55 mph plus head on collision in his 67
panel.  He was not wearing a seat belt.  He was thrown free of the front
and thats about the only thing that saved his legs from being hamburger.

Im hip on seat belts in the back, but im not too sure i want to be
strapped in with my toes 2 inches from the front bumper.

peas,
