Subject: Re: [VB] re: Early bus DISTRIBUTOR  Questions

Hi, what is your serial number on case? Does it have
all the bastard goodies...ie BIG rear main
seal...strange heads ect ect...

Do you have the bastard heads with the small 2 bolt
cover just under the intake manifold holes right above
the valve cover?  Mine where missing and glued shut
with gasket maker yearrrrrs ago. I am looking for to
buy a set or borrow so i can fab some for mine.  Heck
even detailed pics would suit me.  Its all my orig
engine was missing.

A wood splitter huh?  HA HA HA!  Be very
careful...bastard engines where noted to make it much
past 40,OOO miles before total destruction.  If yours
is a bastard and still alive it may be on borrowed
time.  Would advise a tearn down ect before putting
into full use.  Once the bastard goes it 99% of the
time sends a rod through the case...breaks cranks cams
ect...its just a boat anchor then.

My bastard had 42K orig miles.  I took her down to
crank and went through the whole thing with NOS
everything. I was lucky my case was still tight.  I
figure I have another 40K of babying it to shows!

Would love to hear details and see pic of your engine.

Todd
