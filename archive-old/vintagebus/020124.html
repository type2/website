i've got four, three of which run, and always have my eyes open for more.  my sister thinks it's cool and calls the four my &quot;babies.&quot;  my mom has framed photos of her granddaughter (my sister's offspring) right next to photos of her &quot;other daughter's (me) children.&quot;  both my mom and my sister introduce strangers to the whole family - german metal and german flesh alike.  my brother humors us but doesn't seem to get it.  so i guess in a way, they can become more than just a car, something like personalities.  i don't see that it's a masculine sport.  my mom recently told me that she wanted a ghia, single cab and a squareback and that's not family making but pure perversion.  i wonder if i got it from her?
