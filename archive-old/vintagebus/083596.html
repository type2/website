Subject: Re: [T2] Am I wasting my time&gt;

Hello MUD    It is  not the side that normally cracks. Just about all that I 
have seen have been on the 3,4 side, not the 1,2 side . Not saying it cant 
happen just not normal Also the crack tends to go in behind the flywheel also.    
What I would do is to put the manifold and carb on it and start it on the 
floor without any tin so that you can see if it is going toleak and/or if it 
really is a crack.  If it is a crack you might be able to slow it down using J B 
weld.    You are working at a parts place so check to see if they can get you 
the dye kit for checking for cracks.  The Formula Vee guys use this stuff to 
check their front spindles .  later and have fun  Mark dearing
