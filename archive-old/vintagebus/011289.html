Hello everyone, My new to me crew cab has some serious electrical problems.

The factory harness does not appear to have been hacked really, there is

just alot of stuff unplugged. It has a standard relay, but I see no &quot;black

box&quot;. Should I have one? It is a 63 model that has been converted to 12v.

I'm ready to spring for the Bentley manual, where do I buy one? Can I look

at my 67 Westy and copy the wiring? My buddy has a 63 SC, can I rob the

&quot;black box&quot; from it or does it need to be a 12v model? Thanks once again!

black boxes were introduced in 66- rejoice- you dont need or want one!!!!

go to vintagebus,com for Thom's on ine colour wiring diagrrams.

plug the stuff in like stock, and go from there.  Cleaning grouds on 
taillights etc does wonders.  

6V or 12V does not matter to the wiring (you do need the 12V components, 
including a drop for your wiper motor however)
