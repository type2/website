I disagree.  All that is needed is to put the swap down in the parking lot.
Plenty big.  This is what the Northwest Vintage show did, and it worked very
well.



&gt;
&gt; As far as Fords + Chevy vans + pick-ups, if you want to buy parts people have
&gt; to get them there somehow,  not to many people want to put all the junk in a
&gt; restored bus (well Howard + Ronnie did)  and if you think they are going to
&gt; unload their parts and park the Fords/Chevies in the back, no way.....you
&gt; will just get less stuff to buy....
