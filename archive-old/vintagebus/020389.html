Just in case anyone suspects me of being cheap....

I've always been the type to do *everything* - Me, personally, I would
have replaced all 6 cylinders, soft lines, shoes, and master cylinder at
pretty much the moment I decided the car was going to be a keeper, but I
have to respect the fact that not everyone is as anal about replacing stuff
as I am.  On a small-nut bus, this will run ~$300-$400!  My brake bill for
the panel was well over $500, but I also did the master cylinder res., pedal pads,
wheel seals, bearings etc.   OTOH, I can lock all 4 wheels pretty much at will.
I'm also anal enough to keep a set of replacement shoes, master cylinder and wheel
cylinders on-tap at home.

&gt; &gt; The best fix if you're short on dough would be to buy a rebuild kit and fix
&gt; &gt; the cylinders on that wheel.
