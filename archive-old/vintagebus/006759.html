Rancho now has a machine shop use a mill to open up the trannys for 12 volt
very nice and clean, this way you can use it in either 12 volt or 6 volt
mode depending on which flywheel you have. My new 3/88 with 77 4th gear has
the 6 volt cut to 12 and it's real nice, now no more flywheel swaps when
trying different engines out, &quot;the under a load test bed&quot;.

&lt;&lt; Here's my question, where's the best place to get a new rebuilt tranny
for 
my 64.  Im still 6volt so I'm wonderin if i should make the 12 volt 
conversion at this time and get a 67 tranny. &gt;&gt;
Hi Emmet,
Rancho seems to a be a reputible place.  Best to list your area and someone 
around there maybe able to tell you of a more local shop to you.  Always
nice 
to be able to drive over and be in thier face if there is a problem down the

road.
  We would suggest using a 1960-66 tranny and just grind out the bell
housing 
if you really want to use a 12 volt FW.  We just use a 6 volt 200mm FW, 
starter and a 12 volt solinoid.  Makes for a real good turning engine in
even 
the coldest weather here in the NW USA.  The 1967 and later tranny have a 
very small hole for the starter bushing.  This means an even thinner 6 volt 
bushing that is almost paper thin if you decide to use a 6 volt starter.
