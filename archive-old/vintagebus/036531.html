Hello Jack,

Long time no see!

OK- for starters you'll be able to access both outer bearings 
fairly easily.  The upper ball bearing should be a 6305 type
and the lower roller bearing is an 'I dunno right now' number.
The upper axle support bearing is a 6306 type ball bearing
but you cannot pull it out of the housing due to the stub 
axle gear covering part of it.  To get to that one you'll have
to remove the large plug on the back side of the inner half
of the reduction gear box and press out the stub axle.  Be
very careful in removing the plug as it is NLA and you'll have
to reinstall it.  The stub axle inner support bearing is also a
6305 type ball bearing I think so it will be easy to locate a
replacement.   Run either a FAG or SKF brand bearing and
stay away from Chinese no-names and L&amp;S brands. 

Good luck and have fun!
