&gt; So I should adjust the front shoes tight and pull the e brake and 
&gt; loosend 
&gt; all bleeder valves?  Is it necessary to snug up the rear cylinders 
&gt; with the 
&gt; ebrake pulled?  Also, I don't need to put a block on the brake 
&gt; pedal?  

Eric,

On your gravity bleed how many times did you fill up the reservoir?
make sure you bleed all four.
I don't  block the pedal
atmospheric pressure seems to be enough to move fluid past the check
valve
 or at least move the bubble around enough to make the twoman more
effective. 
adjusting the whl clys to the drums also helps the two man by taking out
flex
 ebrake application may be enough  
but I tighten them all to make the final adjustment easy. 
(after a full bleed and tight pedal just back off  the star adjusters
evenly 
untill the wheel turns by hand with a slight drag)

laters

Ken
