Eric and Barb
many thanks for your input regarding the mix-up with my reserve gas lever.

I removed the valve assemble from the tank and removed the strainer just to
eye ball the overall mechanics of the switch. All looked well, so I wrapped
it up and kept it out of harms way until the assemble.

My first reaction on identifying the problem was as you suggested:  the
assemble being out of position by 180 degrees. But, from what I could make
out from the shop manual, 1959 ed. page K-4, (5), I've got it aligned right.

Or do I? The diagram on this page shows the swing of the arch (A, B, C)
towards the back of the bus. That is C position is downward, B is 45. to the
rear and A is upward, precariously close to the starter solenoid. Is that
correct?

When the tank was out I tried to eye ball inside, looking down the fill up
spout and into the hole for the value. From what I could see within that
narrow angle, everything looked nice and clean. No rust or flakes, and I
likewise I saw no filth in the gas when drained the tank. But, perhaps I
shouldn't be so sure. You suggest varnish clogging up the mechanism.
Do you think I might be able to blow this out with compressed air or am I
back to another disassemble?

I'll try the air first. I quess I'll need to run the tank near empty and
then try to borrow an air line for the gas line.

When I get this sorted out I'll definitely keep in mind your advice about
using the reserve now and then. I rarely, if ever used this position, which
may have contributed to the problem.

But what is the source of the varnish? All this started with an engine bay
fire which had the bus sitting in the barn for three months before I could
get to it. Could gas break down so quickly? My image/notion of varnish in
fuel is a sludge. But perhaps this is misleading as I was only looking for
an obvious build up of gunk on the value.

&gt; First if you have installed the switch backwards then to make it run in

&gt; non-reserve running.
&gt; If you had the valve out and did not rebuild/clean it.  Then it is very
&gt; possible that it has clogged up from fuel varnish.  Same thing happened to my
&gt; dad in his 1957 Non-sunroof delux due to not using the reserve on occasion.
&gt; Because of this we like to run the fuel through the reserve for at least a
&gt; couple of minutes every couple of months or so in our 1960.   Eric&amp;Barb
