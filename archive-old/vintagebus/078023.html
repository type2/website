Subject: reduction box rebuild, rear nuts

Volks,

I'm still puttering along at my reduction box rebuild on my '67 
whenever I have the time, and after this weekend, I have some questions:

1) Bentley states: DO NOT REUSE the nut beneath the welsh plug on the 
spring-plate side of the reduction box.  Is there a replacement nut I 
can purchase for this?

2) I would appear that I do not have a magnetic drain plug for my 
reduction box.  This has resulted in metal flakes all over the interior 
of my reduction box.  Is there a good way to get all of these flakes 
out?  I'm thinking lots of clean rags with solvent to wipe down and 
wipe down again until I see no more flakes...

3) Is there a preferred method of pushing the rear axle stub out of the 
reduction box so I can get to the circlip and bearing behind it?  
Bentley shows a VW specific tool.  I expect that I could tap it out 
with a block of wood placed between the axle and the hammer but I'm not 
sure how well it is in there.  Similarly, I could use a 3-arm puller, 
but i'm concerned about damaging the sealing surface on the RGB half 
(even if I placed a rag or something else between the puller arms and 
the case half).  thoughts?

thanks,
    Tom
