hey,
i know it gets to my finace sometimes when im spending a lot of time on the 
bus. the last two weeks have been real bad, getting her ready for the 
detroit show. but the other day she asked me, &quot;when can we take a ride in 
the bus?&quot; and it felt good. cuz i know she really doesnt care what shes 
ridin' or drivin'. also, we plan to drive away in it after the wedding and 
ive heard her tell a few friends she excited about that.

last night i had her TRY to help me put the back window back in... that was 
useless. she gave up after two tries. i was trying to explain the process, 
pulling the string and all. she got frustrated and took off. i wanted to 
strangle her, i could have drove it to work today. she has no patience. i 
have all the windows in, looks good! im gonna wait until after detroit to 
tar the front windows. finally put the SO-44 interior back in, left out the 
rear view blocker cabinet. this interior is way more useful for camping and 
stuff than the SO-42. the bench is HUGE. i have to put the rack back on 
tonite, i was thinking of wrapping the feet with pieces of an old bike 
innertube to avoid paint rubbing off. any ideas??
see ya in detroit....... barring a breakdown ;)
