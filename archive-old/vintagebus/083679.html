&gt; I just recently installed a 205M distributor on my '67. My in-town gas 
&gt; mileage dropped from 16mpg to 11 mpg. The previous dizzy was a 009. The 
&gt; 1600 engine has a 30/31 carb. I have the vacuum line connected to the 
&gt; port just above the fuel shut-off solenoid. Points are gapped at .016, 
&gt; timing is at 32 degrees at full advance and TDC _at_ 800rpm with the vacuum 
&gt; line unplugged at the dizzy. The timing advancement seems real smooth, 
&gt; not jumping around. Could I be using the wrong vacuum port? I am no 
&gt; expert on the 30/31. Thanks for any ideas.

what is the rest of the distributor number? looking on the oldvolks
site there are several 205M. seems to make a difference in what you
time to. Also check the dwell, having the points gapped to .016 is no
guarantee the points are just right. doesn't the 30/31 only have one
port?
