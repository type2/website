Subject: Help!  Door Window assembly seals

Hi!

I really need someone to write me or call me (collect if you wish) with
advice on this rubber that is seemingly impossible to make fit in the door
window assembly.  Felt channels are in and good, but the vent wing seal is a
problem, as is the seal between the window assembly and the door.  I need to
get some seals in these doors ('60 DC) today, as rain is threatening..



(707) 874-9730

Thanks!

Gene
