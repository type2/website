Hey Volks

I'm back from the Africa Beetle Rally. Those who followed the rally at
www.beetlerally_dot_com will know that our bus was the first of the 10 starters
to retire from the event, after a total engine meltdown about an hour after
the start on 1 July! The rally involved driving 7 000km around South Africa,
Swaziland, Botswana and Namibia over 15 days. Start and finish at Durban on
SA's east coast.

There's a long story behind our ignominious exit, so let's go back to the
beginning. Five weeks before the start of the rally, towards the end of
June, my girlfriend Brigid and I dropped our idea of entering the air-cooled
VW rally in my beat-up and butt-ugly panelvan, and instead bought a 1975 VW
Fleetline Kombi, which needed a complete overhaul. For those that don't
know, a &quot;Fleetline&quot; is a Brazilian split-screen bus, assembled in South
Africa one year only, 1975, from a run of 789 RHD Brazilian CKD kits. They
came in three guises, panelvan (like my beater panel), Kombi, which had
standard kombi spec but with windows all round, incl corner windows, but no
skylights or sunroof. There was also a wide-bodied pick-up. They all had
split-screens, and had big-nut reduction box trannies, with sway-bar
late-style kingpin and drums front beam and DP 1600 engine with 12V
alternator. A real mix'n'match of old and new.

Anyway, our &quot;new&quot; bus arrived home in the last week of June. It was finished
in two-tone white over metallic pink (yuk!) which was flaking all over. A
pair of really crusty fibreglass scoops had been moulded onto the body with
loads of filler. Engine had seized sparkplugs and probable burnt valves,
reduction box bearings were in need of replacement but not yet critical, and
I drained barely a pint of oil from the trans. We must have been totally
crazy to even consider totally rebuilding another bus when my panelvan,
despite its crusty appearance, is at least mechanically sound and
roadworthy, and my Dormobile is travel-ready and was probably champing at
the bit to be let loose on the terrible roads in Botswana and Namibia that
the rally traversed.

But we weren't into being reasonable and building a vehicle especially for
the rally had a perverse kind of appeal. I had already sent one of my
engines in for rebuilding. I had given the engine builder an uncut Mexican
universal case with a work-of-art counterweighted crank I had recently
picked up cheap. I asked him to build me a fully balanced and blueprinted
engine with all new pistons and cylinders and new cylinder heads.

We immediately set to work stripping the bus, removing all interior panels,
lights and windows, bumpers etc, then had the shell towed to a backyard
panel shop for a cheapie straighten and respray. Went for non-stock colours,
with the whole bus finished in a blue-grey white, with black bumpers and
window frames. We then added black zebra stripes below the waistline, to
make it look like the old safari tour buses I remember from my childhood. We
didn't manage to finish the zebra stripes for the rally, so only the front
and cab area were striped, but everybody who saw it thought it was
intentional.

We got the new engine and the painted car back on the same day, nine days
before the start of the rally. Then followed day-and-night slaving to
assemble the car in time. I completely overhauled the brake system and
fitted new front wheel bearings. Fortunately king and linkpins and steering
were all tight. Reduction boxes were rumbly, with lots of filings in the
oil, but I opted to do them after the rally, as I didn't have time for them.

The new engine was fitted and fired up and never have I had such a crisp and
smooth ACVW engine. I had built the engine for longevity, but had not been
able to afford a full-flow filter system on top of the new top end and CW
crank ... this was to be my undoing ...

We had planned to leave Johannesburg for the start in Durban, some 600km
(350mi) away on the Indian Ocean coast, before dawn on Friday 30 June, but
Friday found us still dealing with bureaucratic details such as getting
police clearance on the new engine number and getting a roadworthy
certificate. I managed to put about 200km on the rather tight new engine
before we left for Durban on Friday after sunset. We were supposed to have
registered for the start of the rally on Friday and were also missing the
pre-race briefing and dinner, but the organisers told us it would be OK. We
drove slowly through the night running in the new engine. Brigid drove the
first shift while I slept, after working on the car till 3am the previous
night.

After I had dozed for some time, B woke me to say the car's lights had gone.
The engine was still running as we sat at the roadside in the middle of the
night in the middle of nowhere. It looked like a flat battery so I suggested
she turn back to the last offramp where there had been a garage, &quot;but
whatever you do don't stall the engine&quot;. No sooner had I said that than B
dropped the clutch too fast on pull-off and stalled. I managed to push-start
the bus, before taking the wheel and heading back in the dark. Our lights
cast a yellow glow, but soon the engine started misfiring badly. Switching
off the lights altogether freed up enough power to keep the ignition going
and we limped back to the 24/7 garage with me holding a powerful torch out
the window to see by. It was a freezing night and my hands were numb by the
time we reached the garage.

We called the AA but they said they could only send someone out in about an
hour. But the filling station attendants said they could call the garage
owner out immediately so we got him on the phone and he agreed to be there
in 15 minutes. Half an hour later he arrived, apologising for taking so long
but he had had to move a herd of cows out of the road ... He parked his
battered old Ford F100 tow truck behind us and began checking out the
electrics. The Zebra bus had been a nightmare of spaghetti wiring,
insulating tape, bad connections and defunct circuitry when we got it and I
cleaned things up sufficiently to make the car roadworthy, but had been
unable to get the oil pressure and charge warning lights working before we
left. This had made me very uneasy as I would not normally drive a car
without warning lights, but it was either that or miss the start of the
rally.

Anyway, the bush mechanic taught me something new ... that an alternator
won't charge unles it is receiving power, which it gets via the charge
warning light. He jimmied up a solution to get the alt charging, which
involved hard wiring it to the coil, and sent us on our way for less than
US$50. I was very concerned about his gyppo wiring, but it caused no
immediate sparking or melting and the alt was definitely charging so we
pressed on into the freezing night, me at the wheel. I chugged slowly down
the back roads to Durban, pushing the car up to 70km/h and then letting it
fall back to 60km/h, then pushing it back up to 70 and letting it slow
again, and repeating over and over to bed the rings in nicely. B was snugged
up under a pile of duvets and sleeping bags in the back, while I was
freezing at the wheel, in jeans and long johns, vest, corduroy shirt, two
jerseys and a heavy jacket. Outside temp was about -5C. No heating and lots
of draughts in the Zebra Bus.

Even though we were driving slower than 40mph we covered ground steadily.
Then just before the town of Harrismith, about 350km still to go to Durban,
and the speedo started shrieking and then it packed up. At Harrismith we
stopped for petrol and coffee and I handed the driving back to B. Then the
bus wouldn't start. Totally dead. No juice at all. I eventually traced it to
the plastic part of the main fuse melting due to resistance from a poor
connection. Replaced the fuse and we were back on the road.

I awoke in the dawn to find us stopped at the side of a freeway, B saying
two guys in a passing Beetle had flagged her down, pointing at one of the
tyres. We got out and found the left rear tyre partially deflated and
smelling of burnt rubber. Just then a patrol car stopped and two traffic
officers got out and asked us if everything was OK. When they saw we were
equipped to change a tyre they went on their way. Driving on the partially
deflated tyre had damaged the sidewall and the nearly new tyre was scrap.
There was a large wall nail in it. We put on the spare and continued on our
way, now only about 50km from Durban.

We arrived at the Durban drive-in at 8.30am, half an hour before the start
of the day's festivities. The VW Owner's Club was holding its annual logo
day, involving making a giant VW emblem with parked cars, all VWs welcome.
The Rally was due to kick off after the logo photographs, around 1.30pm. The
morning was spent cleaning the Zebra Bus and applying rally and sponsor
signage. I also located a shop who could repair my broken speedo cable, as
nobody had one available. I didn't get time to do the first oil change that
I was keen to do, and the charge and oil warning lights were still not
operational ... (insert Jaws theme)

But then we had to take our place in the VW logo, right after which we took
part in the Le Mans-style start to the rally, with all drivers and
co-drivers lining up and running for their cars. I figured we'd change the
oil at St Lucia, our first overnight stop.

But then disaster struck. Barely 60km out of Durban our fantastically smooth
new engine started running rough and labouring a bit. We were on a gentle
incline driving into a headwind so I thought the engine was struggling
against that. With about 900km on the new engine I was pushing it up to
90km/h (55mph). Then there was a sudden power loss and smoke pouring from
the engine. We stopped immediately to find the engine locked and incredibly
hot, with oil smoke coming from exhaust and crank breather. Bad signs. The
fanbelt was still intact and I couldn't think why the engine would have
overheated so suddenly with all cooling tin and rubbers in place and in good
nick. I strongly suspected a burnt piston, but why?

Other rally participants stopped to see that we were OK, before moving on
when the sweeper vehicle arrived (back-up vehicle was an Isuzu 4x4 loaded to
the gunwales with ACVW parts). The sweeper towed us with a chain to a
filling station off the freeway. By then the engine had cooled, but it was
still very tight. It was starting to look like more than just a heat seize
... with a tight crank it seemed likely that a bearing had turned in the
case. It didn't bear thinking about, but we realised we were out of the
rally and arranged a tow back to Durban.

... to be continued ...
