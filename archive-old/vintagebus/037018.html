One unique thing about this bus is that it came with a factory installed 
Deluxe clock, but no grab handle.  One of the m-codes could be that.  It also 
has the Deluxe Westfalia interior (with ice box), maybe that's the F in F23.  
Anyone know of another source for m-code interpretation?

dash grab shandles were not standard till 62, on deluxes 61, so no handle on 
a 58 that is normal.    I have seen one  maybe two buses non deluxe with 
stock original clocks (one the clock was missing and the holes was painted 
inside edges, original wires to it, that bus had many options(clock, 
ambulance fan, two tone, so 44, steering lock etc), but was in junkyard, 
mashed and stripped)  anyway, maybe that's m544.   I didn't know about m 
codes plates when I saw that one bus, or i'd have checked.    F probably is 
the version of the so23 kit.
