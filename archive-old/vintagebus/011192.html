Subject: Re: [VB] Burnt Clutch??

back to gripping with time.... OR am I now in line for a clutch 
replacement??? &gt;&gt;

Hi Scott,
If you just glazed the clutch disc it will come off in a week or two of 
carefull driving.  If you over heated the clutch pressure plate it will not, 
though usually if the pressure plate was toasted it affects all gears 
especially third and fourth on even slight hills.  Eric&amp;Barb
