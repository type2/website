&gt;&gt;Small pop top should be no problem.  Large on the other hand....   Which is
&gt;why Dormobiles apparently had belly pans under them!   Eric&amp;Barb
&gt;
&gt;Didn't dormobiles leave the womb as sunroof buses? Thom FitzP
&gt;

Westy Dormers may have been built on sunroof buses, which might explain the
different positioning of the dormer top on westies as against Martin Walter
Dormobiles.

My 63 Martin Walter Dormobile, however, is built on a non-sunroof Kombi. It
has no belly pans.

As for structural integrity, my Dormer is definitely &quot;looser&quot; in the body
than buses with intact roofs. I have personally driven this bus very hard
over 35 000 miles and the excessive body flex is visiible where the body
side panels join inner panels -- pulling against the spot welds is visible
as rows of little dimples.

Hope that clears this issue up.
