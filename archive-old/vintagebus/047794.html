I saw a 58 deluxe on EP_dot_com
Looked half way decent.
Asking price was 20K.
Whats up with these prices?
I think hornbeckers bus needs to be 100K in comparison.

&lt;&lt;&gt;I was just cruising everett's site, and saw the '58 deluxe FS,

&gt;$18,700 - lowered, fancy kustom paint.

&gt;Now the punch line: SEATS AND BUMPERS ARE EXTRA!  Oh my!

&gt;

Jeez, wadda ya expect for $18k?!?  ;)


Anyway, that Bus will be removed from my site, it's sold.  I believe it was

sold at auction for a bit less but I was not there.
