Subject: burnt piston

well volks...I think I found a burnt piston.
The shop that the guy took it to to have it timed and tuned up etc... I
found out last night they set the timing at 27' BTDC...or so the guy
says...because &quot;it ran best there&quot;.  On an upright motor?? who's he
kidding??
well.._dot_compression test today shows 120 on 1,2, and 4...but #3 is 0.  A
big fat 0.  so...I think that he burned a hole in the piston...
Does he have any recourse to the shop that did this??  It was a costly
mistake....and it turned out it wasn't mofoco's fault!!  but the motor
only has 200 miles on it...so I'm sure mofoco has screwed up something
and it will show up later on...

well...thats where I'm at now...
