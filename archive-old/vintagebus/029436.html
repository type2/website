This is what I did and it's the cheapest way to go. Get a bottle of Muratic acid
and a gallon of laquer thinner from your hardware store. Start with the acid and
swoosh it around very carefully to remove rust. It does an amazing job and you'll
see instant results. Don't forget heavy rubber gloves and don't let it splatter.
When your satisfied the rust is gone enough, rinse the acid with water to
neutralize and flush out the tank. Get as much water out as possible then flush
with laquer thinner to dry out the water. The thinner will actually pull the
water out of the small pores in the metals surface so you won't get any rust
forming. Use a strong hairdryer cause the heat will also drive the water out.
Keep flushing with thinner till your satisfied. This took me all of 30 minutes,
then I let it sun dry. It's been two years and works great. I did this to my ghia
and I can see inside the tank enough, and it still looks clean. Total cost is
between 12 to 16 dollars.

&gt; Since my engine is out, I'm gonna take the oppurtunity to swap it out

&gt; ahead and do this swap since I've got all the stuff already.
&gt;
&gt; I've read some in the library and in the archives. So what's everyone
&gt; think is the best affordable way to clean out the tank and prep it
&gt; for use?
