country.

Ok, I've run across a strange bus.  It has a split-window front-end,
a narrow-hatch back end, round taillights, and a sliding door!  It also has 
baywindow-style side windows - the long ones.  It also has push-button 
front door handles.  To top it off, it has deluxe skylights, but no sunroof.

I couldn't get inside to get the mcodes.
