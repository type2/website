 Driving in to work tonight my gen light came on bright as the sun.  I've not 
time to work on it at work.  I checked reg. wires and gen wires and all seems 
good.  Any ideas?  Should I attempt the 35 mile drive home in the dark (with 
lights.  Will my new 12V batt make it that far?  Last time I looked the 
brushes on the gen. looked good.  All is clean and in good shape.  
 
 Thanks! &gt;&gt;

check the brushes again.

if the light is brighter at lower rpms i tend to find the problem in the 
brushes

if the light is dimmer at lower rpms I tend to find it is an evil regulator.

batterys drain pretty fast with the headlights on,   but you could make it.
