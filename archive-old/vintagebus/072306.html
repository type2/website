&gt; That's one of the things that should always be a no-no on these little

&gt; compression and some blow by.

Hi Ray,
That is what we thought and additionally since nobody has invented a self 
repairing mechanical engine........

&gt; Oh, also I checked a couple of my dog house oil coolers. One is definitely 
&gt; out of a 71 bus, but the others were from late model bugs.  The bus one had 
&gt; only the remainder of foam on the front side of the cooler (flywheel), and no 
&gt; indication any was ever on the top or back side. The two bug coolers had old 
&gt; foam debris all the way around them like you said.

Very interesting!  Since the doghouse bus engine was (at least for the 
American market) a one year only item we will figure that VW decided it was best to 
increase sealing around the cooler!  Would be fantasic to find an OG 1971 bug 
engine that had never been removed since it left from the factory and see if 
it had the same lack of foam as the bus one you have...............
Tanks,
Eric&amp;Barb
