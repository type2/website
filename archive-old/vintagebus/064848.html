Subject: TorqueMeister

I ordered a TorqueMeister directly from Kymco a week ago 
and received it yesterday. It's a funky online ordering 
system with no feedback, but it worked for me this time. 

This is an amazing tool! If you can't afford the $150, 
hold a car wash with your VW club and share it. 
I put some grease on the 12v gear, grabbed an 11mm 
endwrench and headed for the rustiest flywheel in the 
boneyard. Without too much effort it came loose nice and 
easy. Engine stayed on the driveway.  I'll use a 3/8 
socket next time. The gear &amp; arm has a 9:1 ratio, 30 
ft/lbs to loosen a 270 ft/lb nut! Amazing. 
You see them on a popular auction site occasionally, but 
not much of a price break.
