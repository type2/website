&gt; there is a 53 ed (barndoor, although mine has some post bd photos in the
updates)
&gt; 55 (for post bd 36hp buses)
&gt; 59 (through 62)
&gt; and 63 (through 67)
&gt;
There is a 53 only and a 53/54.  I've only seen 1 53 only, it's on the bookshelf
of a lurker listee.  Perhaps more scarce?  I'm assuming there's an earlier
one too, maybe 51/52 or so?

Another listee had a '56 parts book at BBBV, I'd never seen that one, slightly
different than my '58 copy, awesome condition too, pardon me while I wipe
the saliva off my shirt.

If anyone is interested in some 60s Bug or Type 3 Big Blue VW shop manuals,
I have some of those for sale too, most are $100 each.
