After what seemed like forever I finally got my 67 westy home. While
dispersing with 16 years worth of nastyness I noticed that the VIN plate had
been removed. I bought this knowing that i would have to do a title search
so now i have to locate the #s on the body. My question is where are the #s
stamped at?

there should be a plate riveted in on the right side of the over head air
vent, as well as the one screwed in behind the passenger seat (not sure which
you mean is missing, or both)  also stamped in the metal near the battery n
the engine compartment (where it's horizontal)
