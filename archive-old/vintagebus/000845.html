I'm new to the list, and I have a question.  While removing the driver's
side e-brake cable, it got hung up on something in the frame (I think).
Short of cutting the frame to free this up, how can I get the cable out of
the truck and put a new one in.  I figure if it's difficult to get out, it
will be even more troublesome to put a new one in.  The passenger side came
out and a new one went in with now problems.

Thanks!

Paul
