WOW, that bus is trashed!! the floor has to be non-existant. front 
suspension crusted SOLID. how did you get it to roll on the flatbed? NICE 
score on the hanging lamp though... the plug for those is a strange one. 
there is a recepticle on the side of one of the SO-44 cabinets in my bus. 
get out the simple green ;)
