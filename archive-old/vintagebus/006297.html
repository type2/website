&gt;I think it may be going the same way as the '56 hearse that was on eBay
&gt;recently..........Japan.


Oh that is just purely disgusting.  I thought for sure that someone in the
U.S. would buy it and use it at some of the big VW shows.  Many I've gone to
have sucky PA systems and having a roving sound bus would have been really
awesome.  Oh well...
