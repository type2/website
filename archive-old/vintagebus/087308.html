Subject: Re: [VB] Wiper motor

Hi Busbaby,
Definitely see about going through your wiper motor, or having an electric  
motor shop take a look at it.  Having spare parts for any older automobile  is 
a must.  Having a few boxes of them really helps down the road.   Try 
thesamba_dot_com for a search of the &quot;Classifieds&quot; there for &quot;wiper  motor&quot;.  Found an NOS 
one there that is not too far from you.  Still  it would need repacking with 
new grease....
