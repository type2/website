&gt; Like Boo Radley (Were you written by Harper or Truman, Boo?) I write ad copy
&gt; and own a 66 micro. I'm still working for the man, though. Bradley sounds
&gt; like he was inspired by fine literature, I was inspired by &quot;Lemon,&quot; &quot;Think
&gt; Small&quot; and all those great VW ads.

&gt; Though this has nothing to do with vee dubs, I think Truman wrote it.  Mind
&gt; you, nothing against the capabilities of women writers.  Nice to see another
&gt; writer out there with a bus.
