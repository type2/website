My name is Marsha Roper, my husband Steve is restoring a 64, 21 window.
We are located in Little Rock, Arkansas.  I realize that you are in
California...........but ....we were looking for someone in our part of
the country to put in a headliner.  VW shops are not common around here
and we have had a bad experience with a headline on a 59 european rag
top.  Have you by any chance heard of any good VW shops for busses in
the Oklahoma, Texas, Missouri, Tennessee, Louisiana or Arkansas areas?
Thank you for your input, and we have enjoyed you page since the summer
of 98, when we downloaded a wiring diagram that was of great use to
us..........Thank you for all you help.           Marsha Roper
