I'd asked him for pix and the chassis # (to validate the year)
and he told me I'd have to come down and look at it myself.

&gt; &gt;Does anyone know anything about a 52 bus in Montclair, CA that's for sale?
&gt; I've only seen one picture, but was wondering if anyone had seen it in person.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; If this is the one on eBay, someone posted some negative comments on my
&gt; site about it:
&gt; 
&gt; ----------------
&gt; '52 Barndoor On Ebay / Vwmotors_at_aol_dot_com Warning 
&gt; vwmotors_at_aol_dot_com seems to have the same 2 people. sonicvw and jonny5111
&gt; &quot;shill&quot; bidding on his auctions. All of them!! Take a look and be warned!!!
&gt; Do a &quot;sellers search&quot; for vwmotors_at_aol_dot_com and check all completed auctions
&gt; and you'll see!! 
&gt; ----------------
&gt; 
&gt; So buyer beware, check your references, your mileage may vary, do not open
&gt; before christmas, do not use electrical appliances around water, do not
&gt; taunt happy fun ball, the math can't be done to prove me wrong, etc., etc..
