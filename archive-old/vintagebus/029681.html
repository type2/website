Subject: Re: [VB] carb spacer
References: &lt;39F99603.4E4C34C2_at_vbe_dot_com&gt; &lt;00d401c0403a$9a09fac0$02872a3f_at_renoir&gt;

I put this spacer on a 40hp engine that I stuck in the 62 bus.  The
reason for it was that I needed to lift the carb up so that the
accelerator pump linkage would clear the generator since I converted it
to 12V.  But.._dot_using a governor as a spacer, the carb would sit too high
and I could not fit the air cleaner....so i needed something there to
lift the carb...yet not so high that I couldn't get the air cleaner
on...so I went and milled up a spacer.
I think when I'm just going to put a 28PCI carb on it so I don't have it
on there...plus i had to rob the carb off of it last night to put on my
71.  Thats ok though...because that 40 horse in there sucks.  it burns
oil...leaks oil...and throws oil all over the engine compartment....plus
the tags ran out and its getting stored for winter so its alright.

Thats that though...

&gt; Great milling job and pics.
&gt; Humbly, what is the reason for the spacer?
&gt;
&gt; More volume for mixing?
&gt; Or?
&gt;
&gt; thanks
