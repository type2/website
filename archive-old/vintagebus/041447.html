&gt;   To each his own, but I honestly don't see any
&gt; advantage and several drawbacks to using a deep sump.

Advantages- more oil.  Less contamination between oil changes.
Less likely to pump foam.

Disadvantages- One more place to leak, they hang down and could possibly
be knocked off, they cost extra, and if you are going downhill in the
winter the oil may not heat up for at least 25 miles.

My opinion is that they do some good, but really aren't necessary.
Some of us like to spend as much money as possible building engines.
I figure if it costs more it must be better.:)

I certainly wouldn't go to the trouble of taking one off if it was already
on unless I was going boulder hopping.  I've been down some fairly rough
jeep tracks with my bus with sump on it.
