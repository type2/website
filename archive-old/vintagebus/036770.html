&lt;&lt; The bad: the new style heater boxes do not heat the air, so
 I have more air, just not as warm.

Hi Thom,
Right the replacement heater boxes from Denmark are actually 1963 only heater
tubes in 1964 on heater sheet metal.  The 1962 and  earlier the J-tubes for
the type 1&amp;2 were of round tubing.  In DEC1962 to the end of JULY?1963 the
first fresh air heat exchangers were built with this same round tubing cast
into a aluminuim finned jacket to help increase the outer surface area of the
heater tube.  Then finally AUG?1964 on, the tube cast into the aluminuim
jacket was changed from round to a kind of finned inner surface to increase
the cooling of the hot exaust gases.  The inner shape looks like.   
                                (  )
                                (  )
                                (_)  Which was definitely a interior increase
of surface area over the simple &quot;O&quot; inner shape.  You can see this if you look
into the exaust end of the heater box with a flashlight held near your face so
both you and the flashlight are looking into the tube at the same time to get
a glimpse of the fins farther in.  This increase of surface area on the
interior of the heater tubes also cool the hot exaust gases to prevent too
much back pressure and thusly overheating.  When we last went through
Sacromento CA we stopped by Wolfgang Int. and talked to the owner Steve.  He
said that he had trouble with his bigger engines (Type 1&amp;2 1600-2000+cc)
overheating and having too much back pressure even and hotter running at lower
RPMs.  Especially during the summer, when using the modern Denmark replacement
heater boxes instead of the original German 1964-67 heater (type 1&amp;2) boxes.
When we explained and showed him the internal differance he was surprised but
said it made perfect sense to him.
