&gt; A quick note...Tempered glass CANNOT be cut.  The slight amount of
heat
&gt; differential, as well as the spreading of the crack, will cause the
whole
&gt; piece to explode.  Dont believe me?  Find an old, fogged, piece of
&gt; tempered glass you dont care about.  Take it to your belt sander, and
&gt; slowly begin to try to polish the edge.  Be sure you wear gloves!

&gt; My boss explained the exact why and how, but I have forgotten that.;p

I hate students who don't pay attention in class!  :)

Tempered glass is made by heating a piece of glass slowly to plastic
(slow-flowing) temperatures, then cooling it rapidly.  The outer layer
of glass becomes rigid first.  The inner part, being insulated by the
outer layer, cools slower and contracts.  This puts the inner part of
th e glass under tension stress and the outer layer under compression
stress.  The inner core of the glass &quot;holds together&quot; the outer skin.

Tempered glass is much stronger than untempered glass, as long as
nothing happens to the &quot;core&quot; glass.  If you scratch the outer
surface, the defect will be held together by the core glass so a crack
won't form.  If the scratch gets into the core glass, then the core
glass will come apart on its own, as it is already in tension.
Grinding on the edge of tempered glass or drilling a hole in tempered
glass will cause its destruction!

Windshield glass is made of laminated glass, which is layers of glass
and plastic.  The glass isn't tempered, so it will crack readily and
expensively.  This is why you often see cracked windshields but seldom
see cracked side windows.  Some vehicles have been manufactured with
tempered windshields, but no current vehicles are, at least in the
first world.
