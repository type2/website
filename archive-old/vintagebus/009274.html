Actually, that construction approach sounds like typical RV joint &quot;custom
cabinetry&quot;.  All stuck together with staples and very flimsy and flexible.

They defend that technique by explaining the flexibility protects it from
damage when driving on rough roads, and the light weight optimizes fuel
consumption and reduces wear and tear on the drive train.

If they forget to glue plumbing joints they use the same excuses.  When it
falls apart and dumps sewage all over that merely &quot;demonstrates the ease
with which the system can be serviced&quot;.

Right.....

Heaven help us if they ever start building chassis and drive trains.....

&gt;&gt; Someone just used some kind of paneling and some 1X2 and 2X2 strips to
come-up with something that looks like sort of cabinets. &lt;&lt;
