I finally scored a chemical toilet for my '59 Westy.  And it has a wooden seat to boot.  I remember Thom's had a black plastic seat, and I've also seen them with wooden seats like the one I bought yesterday.

Does anyone know if there were year changes with the seats on these?  Or did VW just commission two different companies to make them?

Now I just need an Enders stove....................Todd??????
