Subject: Show report for Milan Michigan Show.

Well, here is a quick note on the Milan Michigan show.  The show was July 
28th 2001.  The gates opened up at noon and we showed up just after the 
gates opened.  I headed directly for the VW swap vendor area and my wife 
headed for the show cars.  Not too much interesting in the swap area.  But 
as I was finishing my first pass though the swap area I found a vendor 
taking out a type 2 tent.  I immediately went up to him and talked to him 
about it.  Unfortunately it was a tent from a 70 camper.  But, it did have 
all the poles and tent bags and was in great shape.  The vendor was asking 
$300 for it.  Which I thought was well worth it, but without the wife around 
to &quot;bless&quot; the purchase I offered the gentlemen $200.   He came back with 
$250, but anything over $200 I would have to check with the wife.  So then 
vendor said he would hold it for me for 20 minutes so I could go and get my 
wife.  I quickly went to find my wife in the show area and we headed back to 
he vendor.  When we got there, another group of bus enthusiasts were 
checking the tent out.  Heather then told me to get it if I wanted it for my 
61 panel (converted to a camper).  So I quickly paid the vender the agreed 
$250 and we are now the new owners of a standalone tent in excellent shape.  
I have pictures uploaded to www.Vintagebus_dot_com for all to see.  Just search 
for Michael Lynch.  I cant figure out what the address line is for a direct 
link. :(

Anyway the show was really good.  Lots of VW friends and plenty of great 
conversations.  The drag racing was also a lot of fun to watch.  Maybe next 
year I will get the 67 baja ready for drag racing!
