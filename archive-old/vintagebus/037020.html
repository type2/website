&lt;&lt;  OK, here's a problem that I bet none of you have to deal with!  I am 4'11&quot;
tall and have a problem reaching the pedals.  I can either sit on the edge of
my seat to reach them, or slide the seat up so far that the steering wheel
crams into my stomach.  Does anyone have any suggestions on how to remedy this
problem? &gt;&gt;
Hi Rebecca,
First you should check your seat to see if someone over padded it.  Removing
the extra padding will help.  We also due to my hieght like to remove the
upholstery from the drivers seat and trim a coil off of the seat springs to
lower my 5' 11&quot; hieght.  If you still have problems then just make bolt on
shims to raise them and the gas pedal to a hieght you can use.  A little of
both will probably result in a bus you and others can drive with ease.   Eric
