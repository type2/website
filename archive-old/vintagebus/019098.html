To all that are trying to resurect a gas heater:  

Look in the T2 website library under heating.  There is quite a bit of great knowledge to be gleened from all the articles and pictures that have been posted.  Look here 
http://www.type2_dot_com/library/heating.htm

===================================
but the fuel pump did not pump.    I tried with the other one and same deal, 
blower goes, not fuel pump action.  Am I missing something here?   hopefully
===================================

There are a few things that it might be.  The pumps are notoriously sluggish if they have been sitting for long periods.  They will often take more than the stated voltage to get them going after a long sleep.  They usually need a rebuild too.

Also, the heaters have specific cycles in their operation.  Especially the pre BN4's.  Sometimes the blower will operate a certain amount of time(for combustion chamber cooling) before voltage is supplied to the pump again.  Check the library for specific details.
