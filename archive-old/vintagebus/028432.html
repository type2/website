I have to second that!  Harry even bought a round for my neighbor who tagged
along with me!   I owe ya one Harry.  By the way guys, he (my 75 year old
neighbor) was very impressed with all of you and the show in general.  He
couldn't believe that people would fly in from all over the world just to
come to a VW bus show...let alone drive from all over the country.

If people haven't seen the steering wheels Chris is producing, you are
missing an amazing product.  They are every bit as good as NOS.  All the
ribs and finger bumps are there and fully reproduced.  Great job.  At $295
(show special???) he has got the others out there beat by a mile.

&gt; First, Thanks Harry for the beer at TJ's. The rest of the
&gt; bunch, including Thom, it was a pleasure to see you all
&gt; again and for the first time some of you. Had a great time
&gt; at both shows. Maybe I will get a few hits on my steering
&gt; wheels.
