&lt;&lt; Therefore the 111Q motor is 2 speed since all 66's and 67's use the same 
switch???? &gt;&gt;
Hi Karl,
We are not as good with minuta of the post-1963 buses, but we can give it a 
try.  1965 wiper motor is one speed, but used the two speed switch, and had 
one year only pivots.  1966 wiper motor was standard 6 volt and two speed.  
1967 wiper motor was 12 volt standard and two speed.  Both 1966 and 67 used 
the same frame and pivots.   Eric&amp;Barb
