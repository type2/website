Hi!

www.everybus_dot_com  VW  Bus, Vanagon, Eurovan Camping event - coning soon!

Time is ticking away and a few important changes have been made on 
the web site.

The carabus page has had quite a few additions. Check it out and add you info.

Chilli judging now starts at 5:00. This will allow the judges more 
time to carefully select the worlds finest chilli.

T-shirts, t-shirts, t-shirts.  I know that at least 100 people will 
come up to me at EveryBus and ask to buy a t-shirt.  PLEASE 
PRE-OREDER. This year the shirts are the coolest yet! Go to the web 
site, follow the link and send Richard your order.  Order a shirt now 
and avoid spending EB sulking :)

We are working on something big and fun for kids of all ages. More on 
that later.

See you there
