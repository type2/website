Subject: shifter fork seal?
To: bus list &lt;vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

I am in the process of doing a side by side of the old
transaxle and a rebuilt transaxle for my 66.  I needed
to use the old nose cone.  So I wanted to renew the
shift fork seal.  When I got back from the the parts
store (a real VW place not Pepboys) the seal they sold
me came with a new seal housing/carrier/thingy.  Well
the old housing has an od of .715 where it goes into
the nose cone.  The new part has an od of .605.  So as
you can see they ain't going to work.  I'll probably
have to change out the the nose cone so the new
(smaller od) housing will work.  But it sure would be
nice to go educate the parts guy about shift fork
seals.  Could any one out here on the list give me the
low down on this.
                      Thanks 
                      Doug
