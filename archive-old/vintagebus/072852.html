&gt; So remove the glass and old seals, 
&gt; 
&gt; then clean up the windsheild area so it is smooth.  This may involve welding, 
&gt; or merely wire wheeling off old rust, and re primering, spot putty, paint to 
&gt; get a new smooth painted surface.   a few vehicles just need cleaning of the 
&gt; metal with a soapy cloth, but those tend to be desert buses.  You can't tell 
&gt; till you take the windows out, though.

My apertures were restored in 93 I believe, obviously not well enough though...  Does it only really need welding if there are actual holes?  If there are holes should I cut out around the hole and let in new metal or is there another technique I should use?


Thanks for the help
Paul
