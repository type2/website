Can anyone tell what the material looks like that VW used for foot rest
area's?  I am trying to match the material the goes in the bottom foot
well area on the rear side of the cab partition.  There is a resesed
&quot;foot rest&quot; area that some black rubber material get's glued to.  From
the floor to about 6&quot; up.

Anyone have a source?

Thanks
Matthew
