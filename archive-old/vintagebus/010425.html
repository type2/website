Subject: Re: [VB] To avoid legal action, I publically declare I will NEVER distribu 	te a CD-ROM or ZIP of type2_dot_com archives

And this is what I suspected would happen.  I'm on other lists (non-VW)
where are archives are passed around on CD to each other and everyone is
happy as can be.  I was ALWAYS under the assumption that my articles being
posted on the list was &quot;sharing&quot; and that you could always do with them what
you wanted.  It was my contribution, my freestyle writing, free for the
masses, my donation to the VW community.  It's a shame that this putrid
&quot;legal&quot; air has to smudge the list.  You can always legally push any issue
to the max and ruin a good thing and I have to agree that Bob Hoover got the
ball rolling that caused the whole stink.  What ever happened to us sharing
articles with each other?  I thought we gave karma and received it all the
time.  Now that the clothes have been washed and the dirt exposed, I too
find that I'm going to have to drastically reduce the amount I post to the
list in protest of these actions.

Currently, I'm investigating the use of a server where my brother works that
could host a VW list where everything is &quot;run&quot; by the people who sign on to
it.  My goal is to have freely distributable archives to the members of the
list and they will understand that whatever they post will be put on those
archives.  If the idea of freedom appeals to you, please email me.  I'll put
you in my &quot;interested&quot; folder and keep you posted on how things go.  I think
the boys at type2_dot_com do a wonderful job with the lists and I no doubt will
be forced to continue to subscribe in order to hang out with those whom I
consider my friends.  I just strongly disagree with the fact that if CDs
cannot be made, then NO archives should be maintained anywhere at all -
period.    This whole issue of the archives could be solved once and for
all.  If Ken is worried about legalities, then he should delete his copy of
the archive.
