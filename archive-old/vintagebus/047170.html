Hi Jason,
You might be able to retorque most of them with a torque wrench and the 
others by hand if you are good at feeling how much pressure you are applying. 
 If not or it does not work then you need to remove the engine and tranny.  
Once you are that far it is best to just remove the RBGs and axle tubes and 
go through it all and install new side plate and axle tube gaskets and 
inspect all parts and thier sealing surfaces.
