Hi Stephen,
We went up to Canada a couple of years ago for the Pink Floyd concert up in 
Vancouver BC.  Traveled in caravan with Eric's mom, and step-father in thier 
1977 Riviera high top camper, and us in our 1960 panel camper.  Result they 
went through first with no problems.  We pulled up, and the lady asked us, 
where we were going.  Then how many cigarettes did we have.  When we told her 
none she asked again, and a third time when she got the none ansewer.  
Finally she had us pull over to the inspection station, the inspector there 
asked us to get out of the bus, and stay out of the way.  The only thing he 
did wrong was to open the cargo doors at the same time the front passenger 
door was ajar, but he was nice enough to let us stop him before he bumped the 
forward cargo door into the back of the forward passenger door.  He took a 
few minutes to look around carefully, and nicely.  Then sent us on our way.  
The concert was great except for the huge amount of cigarette smoke, and yes 
a little of the funny stuff could be noticed.  Guess that the cigarette 
industry in Canada is doing well up there dispite the huge tariffs at the 
border on this product.  Hack, gag!   Eric&amp;Barb
