&gt; Water!  Oye!  I musta splashed it on when I was doing the wet sanding, and

Most likely that came from water in your air lines.  How big a compressor do
you have?  The small ones (under 5hp 60-80 gal t that are working all the
time will create lots of heat which will then condense the water out of the
air and form in the lines and tank.  Even the best filters can't keep up
sometimes.  Don't be suppressed if you find them elsewhere.  The piping
system you're using should be cast iron  or copper pipe (although I'm running
PVC) run as high as you can right off the compression and then slopping down
to your filter.  This helps keep water at the tank and out of the line.  The
metal piping also helps condense the water out of the air.  Water traps,
filters and of course a disposable filter at the gun will all help keep the
nasty water out of your paint.
