&gt; NQ, a special thanks for everything.  Looking forward to Sundays posts...
&gt; next year ?

Every event I go to turns into a must do event.  I'm finding that the
&quot;shows&quot; don't interest me much anymore.  I like hanging out with the bus
crowd for camping type events such as BBB V.  Those are the daily driver
crowd and the people who know what it's like to slave and toil over your
ride in order to keep it running.  I relate with them a lot better than
those who pay to have it all done.

NQ
