Subject: Re: [VB] How do you buy a new/old Beetle from Mexico?

----- Original Message -----
  They say they
&gt; aren't making them anymore .  as of Wednesday.  boo hoo.
&gt;
&gt; bus content:
&gt;
&gt; how will this affect supply and price of 1600 engine parts?
&gt;

Not much for the next 10 years, as long as they stick with the 'rules'. OEM
parts must be made avaliable for 10 years after the end of production.
We'll see how that goes though.
