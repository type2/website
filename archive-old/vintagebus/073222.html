Subject: Re: [VB] And the saga begins

Sheesh, where do you come from? Lighten up. This isn't
the R&amp;R Forums.
In a way, you are jumping on a non-thinking bandwagon
that accepts anything as a resto. Yeah, &quot;Resto-Cutsom&quot;
would be a better term for all this, rather than
straight out &quot;restoration&quot;, since (again) even Ronnie
isn't even calling it a restoration. IF (and that's a
big &quot;if&quot;) Ronnie was to enter it in a show, in a
&quot;Restored&quot; class and won, imagine how upset the people
who actually had a restored bus would be. Wouldn't
you? I hear it all the time, peole bickering about how
custom stuff gets thrown in restored classes and they
win because people think that a pretty motor and fancy
interior work is original. 
My dictionary (Webster's Unabridged 1989 edition,
definiton #3) states: &quot;restoration&quot;: a return of
something to a former, original, normal, or unimpaired
condition.
Maybe, in general, it would be a good idea to look at
the way other groups of automotive enthusiasts applies
the term &quot;restoration&quot;, and get away from the &quot;Hot
VW's&quot; definition of things. 
Eric, I'm not flaming you and I really don't care what
you think or how you feel about it. 
*I'm just glad that Ronnie is getting a DC like he
wants it.* 
baaa baaa baaaa :)

&gt; Wow, guess what? I still call it a restoration, do
&gt; you know why? Because
&gt; where I come from, there's different kinds of
&gt; restorations. That's just how
&gt; it is up here. It's called &quot;not being a sheep&quot;.
&gt; Think for yourself. Just
&gt; because a group or a majority throws thier voice out
&gt; there, doesn't mean i'm
&gt; going to jump on the bandwagon just to fit in or be
&gt; accepted (the biggest
&gt; problem with the VW community). I've pissed of
&gt; enough people doing that, and
&gt; i'm sure i'll piss off a bunch more.
&gt; 
&gt; So to me, yep, I sure do consider it a restoration.
&gt; Technically correct, no,
&gt; but tough **** if you don't like it. I do call
&gt; things custom or vintage
&gt; resto's, and you don't. Sorry you don't like it. Oh
&gt; wait, no i'm not......
