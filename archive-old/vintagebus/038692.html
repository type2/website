The bus has been out of commission for a week now, waiting for it to get
above 25 degrees, so I could put a new alternator in.  Backing up a bit,  a
week ago, I got in the bus and it barely cranked, but it did start.  As I
was driving home, the lights kept getting dimmer until I had to pull over
and call my GF to come get me.  I got the bus home, and after checking it
with a load tester, it appeared that the alternator was bad.  I am running a
1600 DP out of a 74 Super, and had an alternator with an ext. reg. cobbled
into the bus.  

So I replaced the alternator with a new Bosch internally regulated one, and
thought all would be well.  Not so...  Still not charging!

I have to admit that I hadn't gotten around to getting the red/green warning
lights working, and the gen light wire appeared to have melted at some
point, possibly taking the oil and fuel wires with it.

Could these wires be the source of my problem?  If I have a new alternator
on there, and it's spinning, and it's hooked to the battery, shouldn't it be
charging?!  

Any help greatly appreciated, and quick help appreciated even more.  My GF
is getting tired of driving me to work...
