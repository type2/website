 hola,
 speaking of interior lights... i cannot seem to find where the front lights 
 over my head get their power from. i have gotten new bulbs and such, but no 
 luck. anyone know... and what color is the wire and where does it come out?
 thanks first,
  &gt;&gt;

the power wire goes from somewhere to the switch on the sideof the speedo 
pod.  It bounces from there up the side of the bus, and through the channel 
reinforcement for roof and the red wire pokes out and into your switch.  For 
a better explanation that this consult a color wiring diagram, such as can be 
found on Thom's webpage.

take off your light cover and look at the bulb holder.  have a test light 
with you.  do you have power from that wire.  It does happen that the bulb 
holders go bad.  like the bit can break.  Then you need to get one at your 
next VW show, which gives you an excuse to wander around the swap meet.  SO 
powere or no power to the bulb holder?   How about corrosion?   clean the 
connection wher ethe little metal handle conatcts, where the powere wires 
screws in (careful if it is hot, maybe take out the appropriate fuse 
temporarily?) where the light bulbs contact the bulb holder.   Sometimes 
someoone wires it backwards at the switch at the speedo, and the switch 
activates both the front and back lights.  Well, hope this makes sense, and 
gives you a place to start looking.

both the roof bulb holders in my westy were bad when I got it.  You could see 
where the metal was broken and how that would not run electricity through the 
bulb.
