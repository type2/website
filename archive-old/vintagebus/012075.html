Mime-Version: 1.0

not to jump on the paranoid thread but certain mice (deer mice can't recall mice aren't my specialty) carry the &quot;hanta&quot; virus which can't be caught through the droppings they leave behind..

might want to think twice about diving in and cleaing out those nests (believe the virus is transmitted to humans via the air/fumes whatever..
