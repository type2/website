Subject: Hazet

hello there...
I found a few Hazet wrenches at the MI show this past weekend... and
want to know what they are originally from... years of toolkits etc.
anyone?
They are all the little blackish wrenches.

2 Hazet DIN 885 with sizes 13mm and 10mm
Hazet V-10 with sizes 8mm and 13mm
Hazet V-10 with sizes 12mm and 8mm

They're no high ticket items or anything...i just thought they were neat
:)
