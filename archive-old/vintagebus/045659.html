&lt;&lt; Just did my valve adjustment for the first time the instructions I had 
only had one spec .006&quot; for all the valves. Is there only one spec or do the 
intake and exhaust have different specs?&gt;&gt;
Hi Scott,
This more depends on what type of heads you are using than engine type/year.  
Since you have a dual port adjust them to .006&quot;.  If you are not a newbie to 
adjusting your valves and are not driving through outside temps of well over 
85F you can get away with .005&quot; which will give you a tad bit more HP.
 
&lt;&lt;I'm trying to get my engine temp down  and someone suggested retarding the 
 timeing. I can't find a code anywhere on this engine. &gt;&gt;
The engine case has nothing to do about the timing.  The distributor does.  
Check out  http://www.c-zone_dot_net/jim96003/oldvolkshome/ignition.htm  for you 
particular distributor timing and parts.  Once set recheck how much it fully 
advances the timing with a timing light.  Full advance should be around or no 
higher than 28-30 BTDC.
