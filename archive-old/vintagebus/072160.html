Subject: Re: [VB] '56 Single Cab and observations

that floor is to drool over.  and salt and pepper seats.  not thrashed.  wow

I was just gabbing with a friend and saying how I'm good at keeping my buses 
running and the doors opening and closing right (pet peeve of mine), like all 
the mechanical and driving stuff, but I am slow as all get out about making 
anything look pretty, ie body work and paint.

I pretend it's for various reasons, but it's probably cause I hate bodywork 
and it costs so much to get it done.   Any helpful suggestions?   Other than 
&quot;attach hosepipe to wallet and smile&quot;.   I'd like my 53 to look that nice.

&lt;&lt; This 67 DC sounds comparable to mine; I didn't pay anywhere near $14500 
 for it in 1998.  The 'Old Cars Price Guide' says the ballpark value 
 should be around $15600 in 'trailer queen' condition, or $10920 in 
 'superior resto/excellent original' condition.  Then down to $6240 for a 
 'older resto showing wear/operable original'.
