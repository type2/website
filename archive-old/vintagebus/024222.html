Most vehicles have personalities, VW's just seem to have
them at the extremes.  My history of VW's: My '64 was a 
delight, slow, reliable, easy to fix, never let me down.  
My '67 always broke down, and always a major brakedown.
I had it for 3 years, probably drove it 1500 miles.  The '64
for 4 years, drove for at least 60000 miles. The '67 Sqbk was
a very reliable vehicle until a few years ago, then parked.

The '80 Westi, while I kept driving it, it seemed to be
constantly needing expensive work.  Some are good
vehicles, some aren't.  By keeping at it and doing the
proper maintenance, you can get the bad ones better,
but it's a frustrating journey.  Haven't driven my latest
'67 enough to form a driving opinion yet.  It sits on the
driveway well though!

'67 Deluxe Hardtop (needing brake work)
'67 Squareback (waiting ressurection by son &amp; self)
'87 Subaru (driver until Deluxe ready)
'97 Quest (SO's)
'64 Ford F100 Crewcab (backup for ALL the above)

&gt; &lt;&lt; reading some of these stories really scares the sh*t out of me 
&gt;  :)  Never
&gt;  leave home without the trusty F**D. &gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; I hope your not serious......if maintained and built properly, busses 
&gt; have
&gt; crisscrossed the country many times, and how about when they were 
&gt; new? Keys to
&gt; a Ford didn't come in the toolkit, last time I checked. I feel a 
&gt; little miffed
&gt; about this, because of the people I know who have put in the serious 
&gt; miles,
&gt; with nary a problem (this is where i should pat myself on the back 
&gt; for all the
&gt; miles I've done without incident, but there's too much of that already). 
&gt; If
&gt; done right, you don't need a support vehicle.
