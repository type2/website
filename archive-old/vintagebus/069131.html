Hi Ed,
A kind of felt is what they seem to be.  We use folded pieces of tar paper 
under the tank.  Why?  Because the two plaes that bus gas tanks rust out is:
1.  Where theses felt strips hold water like sponges under the tank and rust 
through.
2.  The area near the outlet tube in the bottom of the tank traps water and 
gunk in the bottom of the tank.  To prevent this cut the outlet tubing as far 
down inside the tank or if using a reserve switch remove the shorter tube 
completely.
