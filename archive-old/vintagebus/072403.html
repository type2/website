Subject: Re: [VB] I need to idle

Help, its been 10 years since my last vw experience, and last fall I
bought a 64 standard, which now is not idling properly.
----------------------- Clip ------------------------
I had calcium scale in my carbs and jets partially clogged.
Cleaned them with Lime-A-Way runs fine now.
