What are the correct bolts to hold the belly splash pan in place?  The parts

book says they are self tapping hex bolts but I pulled a few from a 62 and

they were machine thread hex bolts.

- - - - - - 
there are some of each- the machine thread ones are the same thread as the 
engine tin screws but use the ones with the 10mm hex head for ease of removal.

also- you dont actually NEED to have all the bolts in to hold the pan in 
place, which is good as it seems that often there are some broken off and 
filling up the holes
