Sure you can.  It's the other direction (12V flywheel, older tranny)
that causes problems, because the bell housing's not large enough.
The tranny itself doesn't care what voltage the vehicle is using,
since it's a purely mechanical device.  Thus, as long as the mechanics
line up and clear each other, you're fine.

Now, you *do* have to use a proper bushing and such to provide support
for the end of the starter.  I used a 6-volt starter with a &quot;12-volt&quot;
gear on it for several years after converting one bus to 12 volts.
