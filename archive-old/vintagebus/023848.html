...Having been a westy freak for many years I have come across the &quot;shrinking plastic trim&quot;
more then enough times...here is what I have done on many a bus with great results

I found...
-that if you carefully remove the very stiff deformed plastic...
-boil a large (as you can) pot or basin of water
-remove the water from the heat
-slowly emerge the stiff plastic into the hot hot!! water
-as the plastic hits the water you will find it slowly becomes very soft and pliable again!!
-all of the warped and deformed sections should smooth right out!!
-the plastic is now very very pliable and can be stretched...... if shrunk from years of sun
damage
-I use a light coat of epoxy in the grooves on cabinets were the trim goes
-then quickly stretch and fit the plastic trim into place
-a couple helpers maybe good to hold the trim in place while it cools
-act quickly, as when the trim cools it will rear harden into whatever shape it current holds
-NOTE you can do this to a piece of trim as much as you want if you find you were not quick
enough with your application
-any questions feel free to contact me

GOOD LUCK and have fun

&gt; Sorry Steve and List, I wasn't clear. My Westie does have beige plastic trim around
&gt; the cabinet openings. My friend told me about a guy that makes aluminum reproductions
&gt; of the plastic trim. Sure its a cheat but all of my plastic trim has shrunk after 34 years
&gt; and aluminum painted beige might be the way to go. Any thoughts???
