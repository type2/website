mmmmm,

Sounds like one is a leetle too tight and one is
a little too loose?

In my experience when fitting *new* pins and bushes
the bush is a tight interference fit but installed using a drift...
i.e.,  moves in quire smoothly but is tight.

The bearings and pins (greased) slide in (no tapping required)
but are tight and have no perceptible up and down play.
I'm wondering whether the bearings are actually going
to roll in your 'tight' side.

Aas a qualifier, my experience is limited to the earlier (21mm) link
pins and OEM parts.

&gt; 
&gt; im installing rebuilt spindles in my 66,  i had new bushings put in and i
&gt; have new linkpin kits, when i put the pin in the bottom on the drivers
&gt; side
&gt; , i really had to tap it hard to get it in there with the needle bearings
&gt; on
&gt; it, it went in fine but very tight, the top on the drivers side just slid
&gt; right in and feels loose, even has a slight up down play in it, so my
&gt; question is how exactly is it supposed to be?
