Subject: Parts and 2/3 front seat clip picture

Hi Steve,

My 67 tipper had the left side clasp broken off when I got it but luckily,
it had fallen in the hole under the seat so I was able to weld it back onto
the body.

When I read your original post, I recalled that i had a picture of the seat
clasp and I thought that it would be nice to post these for those odd times
people want to see a specific part.  Accordingly, I put a new page on my 67
tipper page to hold odd ball pictures...

For you, i'd search out a bus being parted out and get the
clasps/clips/whateverUwant2call !

I am installing a 2/3 passenger seat in my 66 bus.  When I bought the bus
the seat was in it but just kind of laying there.  I see there are two pins
that hold the front of the seat but what holds the seat bottom down.  There
is a small hole below the frame on the right side and a short platform on
the left side.  Is there a special clasp to secure the seat?  Anyone know
where I could find a diagram of the seat hardware or where I could find the
fittings?
