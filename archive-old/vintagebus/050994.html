Subject: Re: [VB] New Listee Sticker Submission

The OCTO is Sunday 10 February you will have to work very fast, maybe
someone in the bay area will bring them down. LOL
P &amp; C

I am having 100 made to start out, and will have at least 50 for OCTO.
I
would like it if some OCTO attendees would post comments once the
stickers
are seen in person. I am likely looking at selling them for 3 bucks....5

tops.._dot_dependent upon the final price from the vinyl guy.  They are a
two
color sticker and have to be layered...thus the higher price.

They are approx. 5&quot; wide by 2.5&quot; tall.  Black and white.  They actually
came
out pretty cool because the windows are cut out so you can see through
them.
