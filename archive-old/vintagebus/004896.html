FYI
   The hardcore Bus scene has known for the past few years that SOTO became
just a front for Dave Heard to collect cash and score the good parts from
the classifieds before they were printed (most times the newsletter was
never printed).

   Finally somebody stepped to the plate and called his bluff and now he is
scrambling to make SOTO a legit cause again. Like get in free with a can of
pet food, nice try but to little to late. So if you want to hang with the
hardcore guys go to OCTO show if you wannabe a wannabe go see Dave at the
SOTO show and tell him i sent you.
