 Clara im still wondering, If my 55 manual (&quot;1955 edition&quot;) was printed  in
 Nov of 57, How can it cover late 57 up to 59 models? What about the
 dissasembly of the mid 56-59 air cleaner or the mid 57-59 decklid, or the
 new taillights started in mid 57? Surely there must be yet another manual
 covering mid 56 (57?)  up to 59?
  &gt;&gt;

well,it's like this:   let me use the 59 edition I have as an example.   It 
was published in 5/59.   so how does it cover through 62?   cause the central 
VW intelligence agency sent update pages to each dealership.  many of the 
pages are are dated 5/59.  but there are quite some that have later dates.

I no longer have the 55 edition, so I cant comment on that.

my 63 edition is dissimilar to the Bentley in that there are multiples of 
pages.  It is weird- they just added in all supplements and some section are 
confusing cause of this.   how can a book pub in 63 cover a 67?  cause it has 
all these pages sent out as things changed on the bus, and the dealership 
added them in.

they did the same thing with parts lists, excpet it is all those pages at the 
front.  And a mid sixties ed doe not cover a 57 bus as well as a 58 ed does ( 
supercessions)

does the bentley reprint have that little chart I wrote before, that says 
there are 4 successive volumes/edition of the Transporter Workshops Manual?  
THat is why I think there are 4.  I could see that there could be say a 55 
edition that did not get all the updates.   It is not uncommon for there to 
be multiples of some pages, and some pages missing from the originals.  And 
of course the dates on the pages in the book would not be all the same.  does 
the Bentley have dates on each page?
