Subject: Re: [VB] Flipseat westies

part # A 57  in illustration 38 of 63 ed parts list (on OACDP)

Bow - roof, center   pn 211 817 323.  the metal brace across the middle of 
the roof. behind cargo doors.     came on kombis, standards, non sunroof 
deluxes, not on trucks or sunroof buses.  The rear interior light screws to it.    
Keeps the roof skin from sagging.   at least somewhat.

the sunroof buses and big poptop buses either don't have that center metal 
bow, or had cut it.

Flip top westies *also* came with wooden bows for around the flip top.   
boxes it in, supports it.  the hatches are not light, and would buckle the roof 
there without additional support.   I've started reproducing these wood bows..

light goes) and so they figured the subfloors weren't needed.
