AAAAAGGGHHHH!!!! Now my Todd Hill tranny's 3rd gear sounds like a blender
full of wing nuts as I release the clutch and does not engage and when it
does it pops right back out ( Warning, some curse words are coming up ) Son 
  of    a    bitch!  (Sorry for the lack of control).  The old tranny that
this one replaced was fine so could I scavenge parts from it in a pinch or
do I need to send this POS to a rebuild shop to replace the crappy stuff
inside.  I don't know what else to do!!  I've checked the shift selector
plate, couplings, fluid level and prayed to the VW gods but still no
results.  Todd, if your out there would you please.... oh never mind, I'll
find another source of info.
Words cannot describe my frustrations.  Any serious advice would be
appreciated.      JIM JAMES
