Subject: Anyone in Reno Nevada..want a club?
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Ok I'm still trying to form a club here in the Reno area..I would like to set
up the first event after Thanksgiving but before Christmas.... I would like to
have a dinner/gathering someplace then a cruise through Hidden Valley and look
at the lights. I have all kinds of ideas for a club and have a homepage set up
with some pics of people that have shown intrest in the club. If you are
interested please stop by the page and sign the guestbook/e-mail me. I also
need some more local links so if you have a page even non-vw send me the link
(must be reno related) I would like to get out and get some more pics and get
a club started! Also since we made coverage in HOT VW's per &quot;Transporter Talk&quot;
and Hot August Nights.
