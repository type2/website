I have something called a &quot;TOUR-DE-BED the cartop sleeper&quot;.
Its about 4 feet wide by 7 feet long.
Made out of aluminum.
Has some clamps that fit in the rain gutters of a bus, they are adjustable 
and would fit pretty much any car with raingutters that was that long.
It happened to fit PERFECTLY inside the &quot;CAGE&quot; of my steel roof rack so i 
removed the clamps.
It just sits inside there.
Folds up about four feet tall like a &quot;TENT&quot;. Has a matress in there.
Kinda cool (I thought)
I brought it out to the JEROME JAMBOREE last year.
Did anyone happen to like it enough to take a picture?
I forgot to with all the rain and all.
Id love to have a picture of it setup.
Regards, Greg

&lt;&lt;Since were talking tents today, here's a question that's been bugging me 

for some time.  I've got some old original VW camper ads circa 1964, 

that shows a splitty camper with a tent on the roof.  The tent is only 

accessible from climbing a ladder on the rear of the bus, and the tent

is mounted on a roof rack.  I've never seen one for sale, and never seen

one at a show, or anywhere for that matter.  Have any of you ever heard

of or seen this tent?  The ad says to get the &quot;upstairs&quot; option, you

have to get the &quot;Super De Lux&quot; kit.  I reckon not many of these were

sold.
