&gt; Which brings me to a question. What's the best thing to use to protect the
&gt; wood slats from the elements. Some kind of shalak? Or Thompson's? or what?

Rex,

I did it the hard way on my rack. I put three coats of varnish on them,
sanding between coats. It was slow going, but I really like the way it
turned out. The varnish hasn't cracked or flaked anywhere yet and it's
been two years since I put it on there. My rack stays on the bus and
gets used in whatever weather happens when the bus is out. The bus
*isn't* my daily driver, though. So the rack doesn't get exposed to the
weather that much.
