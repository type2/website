A few to ponder.
 
For a homemade alarm.  Hidden toggle switch, alarm and 
ignition kill activated with brake usage.
http://www.harry-the-planet_dot_demon.co_dot_uk/alarm.html
Uses three position toggle.  On Off On, second on is
to bypass to allow someone else to drive.
Add an electronic solenoid activated engine bay lock
and I'd be happy.  Looks pretty good, and cheap if
you know how to solder.  Could use type of switch
used below for the stealth switch.


Another device is one that has a touch panel switch,
that can hide behind a door panel, defaults to ignition
switch off, touch to engage, has mode for a garage to
work on vehicle.  $99

Beware of wear patterns, same goes for magnetic reed 
switches.  Touching same spot over and over again.


This one applies pressure to brakes after brakes applied,
using one way valve, locking brakes. 
No price, if you have to ask . . . .

There is always the Mr Bean approach:
Remove the steering wheel!


Personally, I'd start with an ignition kill (homemade above)
then one that simply notifies me
that the car has been moved, and it's current
location (GPS).  I'll take it from there and call the
cops.  A system like this is out there, just haven't
found it yet.  Found a GPS on a chip company that
foresees this product, SiRF.

Gotta lock engine bay, as it's WAY too easy to bypass
the whole front end of the bus!
