Speaking of mirrors, I just received a set of mirrors I bought off a guy in Cypress(the country)!  They are round and of similar design to the stock early mirrors, but they are about an inch or two larger in diameter.  The mirror glass is the cool part.  They are slightly convex and have a larger field of view.  They were said to be for busses, but the mounts are slightly too large.  

Not sure if I'll like them, but the black will look good on the commercial double cab.  Check them out at RB/KP.

speaking of mirrors has anyone seen the repro'ed &quot;harp&quot; mirrors (the ones w/
the diagonal reinforcement?)

thinking of getting a set..

m.

Ronnie's statements mirror my own sentiments, and reflect a good image of the
guys doing the repros.
Looking back, I wish I'd bought a set of these for the '55, but then again,
not
every project has a silver lining.
