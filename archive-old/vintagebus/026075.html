&gt; I am wondering has anyone compare there speedo reading
&gt; to 'actual' speed via other means.  This maybe due to
&gt; using smaller then stock, radial tires in the place of
&gt; correct monsterous height bias plys?
&gt; 

i used my friends GPS to check the accuracy of my speedo.  with
195/75r14's it was dead on all the way up to 80. (and i was flooring it
to do that!)  just for informations sake, i have the original spare tire
to my 66 westy, and the 195/75r14's are the exact same diameter. 
although 185's and 165's look better (to a lot of people, myself
included), and are really popular on bus's, if you want exact same
height, 195's are the ticket.


&gt; My speedo is dead on the nose correct with 6:40-15&quot;s
&gt; bias plys and is exactly 5 mph too fast with 195-75's.

5 mph at what speed?  its not going to be 5 mph off at all speeds, it
will be a ratio.  if its 5 mph off at 60, it will be 2.5 mph off at 30.
195/75R14 is the exact same diameter as my original german spare.
