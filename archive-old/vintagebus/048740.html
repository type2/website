Subject: Carb vacuum hoses

I'm finishing up the assembly of my 1600cc DP engine to go back in my 
'59 Kombi.

As i've said before, a lot of little stock parts were missing from 
this engine. I've replaced all of the engine tin pieces. I've also 
replaced the J-pipes with full heat boxes. I've removed the 
block-offs on the fan shroud and will get the hoses to go from it to 
the heat boxes tommarrow.

I'm gonna use an oil bath air cleaner with the engine. It's got a 
34-pict carb. I've got the distributor vacuum line hooked up. There 
are 2 other vacuum lines coming out of the front of the carb. They're 
plugged right now. What are these supposed to go to?

There is also a vacuum line coming off of the intake manifold that is 
also plugged at the moment. What should this go to?

If it matters, this engine case is from a '75 fuel injection beetle.

I think after I'm done this time the engine will stand a better 
chance of running at the right temperature.
