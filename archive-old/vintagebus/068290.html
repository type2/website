Subject: Re: [VB] Can you tell from the pics?

Well its a 68. odd combination of mix and match interior.
Looks like a european/canadian small poptop on there which could possibly
be a graft. looks to have westy type wood kick panels but an assortment of
passenger interior panels and seats.
Did you get a bad deal?
well the parts I see arent in too bad shape visually....
If its not rotten in the places you cant see and if most of the parts are
there to reassemble it then maybe its not such a bad deal.

&gt; Im trying to identify this bus.  I just bought it, more or less sight
&gt; unseen.  All i have are these pics.

&gt;
&gt; &gt;From the best I can tell, it's a '67 (the yard boss thinks).  I think
&gt; its a westy from pic 2 and pic 3.  you can see the short pop up
&gt; housing and the roof rack.  he also thinks it runs, but he does have
&gt; all of the 5 lug wheels and the engine appears to be complete.
&gt;
&gt; i paid $500.  did i get robbed?
