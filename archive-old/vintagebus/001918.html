&gt;I'm running a 009 and my exhaust is really hot as indicated below.  No
&gt;matter how I tune
&gt;the carb, I can't get a bit of soot to appear in the tailpipes.  My oil
&gt;temp is pretty high as well.
&gt;
&gt;It was also suggested to me by the engine builder to put 135s in the
&gt;main (I think I have 132.5 or
&gt;something like that - 34pic3).  I haven't done that yet but I'm sure I'm
&gt;running lean.


I'd go a bit farther than that if conditions are as you indicate. Also check
that your mixture and volume screws are adjusted right. Seems to be an
epidemic of lean running buses lately. Hmmm, probably something to do with
global warming.
