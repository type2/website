&quot;Take a gander at some of your 911 receipts some time...&quot;
I probably have a whopping $300 in it over two years.  Granted it is not a
DD...  I would like to dump a lot of money into it though :)

I am certain that the bus has cost more in the last two years than the 911
(not including the stereo which I went nuts on).   Granted that could change
at anytime if something expensive breaks on the 911.

It is amazing how many people think the 911s are money pits, but in reality
they are probably the least expensive &quot;exotic&quot; car to drive.  Probably
cheaper in the long run than the BMWs and M-Bs, no timing belts to change or
vacuum systems.  I can do a cyclical 10,000 mile service for less than $50
on the 911 if I do the work myself.  Last time I checked the Honda 15,000
service cost about $150-$200 at a dealer and the 90,000 timing belt around
$700, I will take the 911 any day over any Honda.

Air-coolers rule in all shapes and sizes!!!

&gt; ???  $8K!!!  Without paint!   Come on now.  There are not that many parts
to
&gt; a Thing.

You'd be surprised.  A top-quality engine rebuild, using
mostly new components and top-notch machining can run about
$2k.   To completely go thru the brakes on an early *bus*
will run you about $700, don't know what it is on a Thing.
Body pieces for things are getting expensive because they
are getting popular now, and never were numerous.   Bodywork
is expensive, figure at least $50/hr. 

Oh, and Harry's Thing was electric, so I'm sure there's
some extra expense there, ie batteries, motor, whatnot.

The money disappears like you wouldn't believe.  Take a gander
at some of your 911 receipts some time...
