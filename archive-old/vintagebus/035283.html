Subject: Safari Window PROBLEMS!
To: VintageBus_at_type2_dot_com

The safaris that I purchased from Creative Engineering have decided to take a 
crap on me.  The hinge where it meets the frame has separated.  So whats the 
easiest way to fix this?

Diagram:

-o=--
- is the hinge to body
o is the hinge
= is where the hinge meets the frame
- is the frame

it separated at the = causing it to bend and flex.  So is there a cold weld 
solution or am i stuck trying to find someone to spot weld this?
