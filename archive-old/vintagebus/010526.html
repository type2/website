For some reason, Dan Kinsey couldn't make this post to the VintageBus list
so on his behalf, I'm posting this for him.  DO NOT REPLY if you want to
talk to him.  Make sure you email HIM and NOT ME.

Subject: [BSKA] Binz restoration, &quot;T&quot; minus 30

Only 30 days until I hand my Binz over to John Jones for paint and body
work.  Most of the Binz remaining are in the &quot;long term project&quot; stage.
There are about three, including mine, seriously underway in hopes of being
completed in time for a Binz gathering at The Classic in 2002.  The Binz
gathering should be way cool.

Here are the few parts I still need to finish the truck:

Nice front floor mat
Passenger side, '55 - '58, truck bumper splash pan.
Straight painted hubcaps
Single or Double cab tilt canvas


Have the following to trade.  Trade only, not for sale:

'55 - '58 Deluxe bumpers, front and rear, with trim, bumper brackets, and
splash pans.
13, 21 and/or 15, 23 window deluxe Belt line trim
13, 21 and/or 15, 23 jail bars
Bay window crew cab tilt, complete.  Fits Splitty as well.
Bus Crank tin rear apron, Crank, &amp; Crank nut
Rear seat kick panel(s)
Muti-band radio(s)
Lot's of misc.
South African Vanagon grill complete with H4's
