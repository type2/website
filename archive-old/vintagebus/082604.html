Subject: Bosch 021 distributers timing question?

Ola Splits,

  Well I installed the Bosch 021 distributor yesterday and tried to set
the timing. It seems that the metal pot pie (vacuum advance) won't allow
it to turn around so the notch on the rim is at the 1 cylinder firing
position, so I need to either re-arange the wires (1&amp;3, 2&amp;4) or change the
valve setting 180 degrees apart (probably the wires!) This distributer
seems to be the one for 71 engines and I've heard that the Mexican Engines
are similar to these.  Anyone had any experiance with the Bosch 021
Distributor?

Best,
joe

&gt;   Today, it was warm (high 40's) so I went to my VW guru Larry and he gave
&gt; me a 021 distributer. I've been running 009's on both of mine for so long
&gt; I didn't really see how that part vacuum advance of the engine compartment
&gt; adds eye candy...although I hav'nt gotten it started yet (fuel tap leaking
&gt; from being too rough changing the starter on the solenoid) it looked
&gt; pleasingly retro with the mini pot pie hanging on the side of the
&gt; distributor and I felt enlightened by the original design added
&gt; complications instead of simplicity.
