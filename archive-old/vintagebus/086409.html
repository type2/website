Subject: Need some wheels

Anybody know where I can get some wheels in or around the Orlando area ?? My 
son has a tire store .. his supplier says I need to order them .. which I 
will unless I can find some great deal ..
As for my wheels .. Two of them are missing the clips that hold the hubcap 
.. [in case anyone is interested once I replace them all .. ]  Want 
something colorful !!

Diane
