 Sigh, I know this has been beat to death, but know I find myself the victim
 of the wont start syndrome. '66 Sundial, when I bought it, it had a 8volt
 bat and a Ford relay for a hot start. 'Course I want it correct so new 6volt
 bat. ditch the Ford relay, new solenoid and rebuilt starter. Wont start,it
 does if I cross the solenoid, faint click as the key is released from the
 start position. Trying Eric &amp; Barbs tip, I've been cleaning the fuse box
 terminals. Still no go, any thoughts ?

electric path to start bus up:

electricaity in battery wire to starter (13mm mut place)
from starter to fuse box
fuse box to headlight switch'
headlight switch to ig switch
through ig switch when turned to ' start'
from ig switch to push on terminal of starter.  
ground through trans to body to battery.


Cleaning fuse box is good, but if you look at the above list or a wiring 
diagram the fuse box is only one stop along the way in this circuit) (still 
good to clean it up, use that dielectric grease too, supposed to keep 
connections clean of corrosion)
you should also clean all the above connections.  Sometimes just cleaning the 
ones at the battery and starter and ground makes it work.

You said it starts if you cross it at the starter, so there is a problem 
somewhere in the system.  Corrosion that blocks electricity flow.        This 
happens to 12V buses as well, I have had to clean connections on 12V VWs to 
get things to work.   Then again, I have also sometimes cleaned everything 
and had it improve but not start with the key 100% of the time, and that 
makes me suspect corrosion in the old OG wires.
