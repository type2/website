&gt; So the wife's gone to bed early and I figure it's
&gt; prime time to sneak out to the garage for some late
&gt; night fiddlin' with ol' DARTHVW.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, I figured I would align my inside cargo door
&gt; handles the right way (both pointing up when closed
&gt; and latched, right?). Sure, I went out there to change
&gt; the tranny oil, but you how you get staring at
&gt; something and all of a sudden plans change....
&gt; 
&gt; so lo and behold I get the inner handle off the rear
&gt; door (the one without the outside handle) and the
&gt; threads for the screw to hold it in are stripped.
&gt; 
&gt; Now what?
&gt; 
&gt; Can you rethread these? Or should I get a new
&gt; mechanism?
&gt; 
&gt; Do I have to get it with the long bars which go into
&gt; the roof and floor? Or can I easily swap out the
&gt; center piece.

I'm pretty sure that the thread is in the shaft of the outer latch. So the
inner latch attaches to the outer latch. So if you can't rethread it, you
can probably just replace the outer latch. Anyone, feel free to correct me
if I'm wrong. I just remember not having an inner door latch for a long time
and I had a hard time keeping the outer latch in there when opening and
shutting the door!
