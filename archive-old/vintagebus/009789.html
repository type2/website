Well, at least my wife understands why I keep &quot;an old Bus&quot; in my garage and
Bimmer in the driveway. Last time I mentioned selling the Bus she just said,
&quot;Don't do it cause you know you'll buy another one next week. If you're
happy, I'm happy and best of all our kids love it.&quot; That keeps me going.

Later,

&gt; &gt; She just looked at me and said, &quot;Why not just leave it off?&quot;
&gt; &gt; I looked back at her with a buslier than thou smirk and asked.  &quot;Why
would I
&gt; &gt; leave the top off a poptop bus?  She calmly replied, &quot;It would make it a
lot
&gt; &gt; easier to pour you money into it&quot;, and walked away.
