Just my thoughts and I'm not &quot;officially&quot; on the AIRS list because I 
recently got a more permanant address and just signed up for the AIRS 
list-it hasn't showed up for 2-3 weeks yet, but anyways..I don't know if I 
speak for anyone else out there, but I'll be glad to offer help to anyone 
out there driving driving a bus (or just about any VW for that matter), 
whether or not they're on the list, or on a long road trip or just going 
home from work.  I'm newer to the bus world and my total knowledge and tools 
are limited, but if one of the many quarts of oil I have behind my seat will 
help, I'll gladly stop on any road for them. I've gotten much help from bus 
folk and hope to return it someday.  As far as SPAM goes, I have the ability 
to delete it at no expense to me, so there's one vote from me to keep it as 
it is.  If someone doesn't really want to help busses and their passengers 
in time of need, why be on the list? (not intended to be taken offensively)  
To me giving a helping hand to someone in desperation is worth deleting SPAM 
every day.  Take it as it is with the knowledge that I may be opening my big 
mouth again without fully knowing all the facts of what's going on.  Happy 
driving--Chet
