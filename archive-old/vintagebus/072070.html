Subject: Re: [VB] 60 single cab wheels Q

the 15&quot; bus rims have 4 sort of rectangular gaps around the center of them.  
The 15&quot; bug rims are smooth, and slightly narrower.   if you look at the rims 
for size it's in a little circle on there somewhere.

I am looking a a 50 sngl cab thats 4 sale but it looks like it has bug wheels 
on it. Can someone tell me what is the correct size wheel for that year? I'm 
guessing 15 inches.

Thanks,  Ken Linoski
