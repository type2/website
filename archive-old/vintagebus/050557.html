Subject: RE: [VB] drafty front floor  :(

im just doin my 1960 mcrobus, i dont want it to be a show winner but at
least keep rust away.

As im not as equipped as other, where i cant get sandblasted, i clean =
and
apply POR15, as i did for my front floor, i cut the rustes through, i =
clean
the rest of the front floor and applied POR-15 over and under the =
floor,
then ill need to put a ne passenger side floor section later, the =
driver
side could be salvage with minor patch welding, but at least POR-15 =
prevent
the rust to make more damage.
ill suggest you the same, scrub most of the rust, clean all grease/oil, =
then
paint the floor with por15... it will remain at least forever in this =
state!

Hi, ya I do have the underfloor pan.  The draft I plugged was to the =
left of

the pedal pan.   Crawl under your bus and look to the driver side door =
from=20
the pedal pan- that is where the hole is.  you could just about put a =
foot=20
through it.

Don't be such a freakin' resto purist.   This bus needs ENTIRE front =
floor,=20
not just what the patches cover, capiche?    It came new with leaky =
safari=20
windows.    Remember where it got hit on left drivers door and the =
front=20
floor is bent?   This would take more than 2.5 hours.  Thom has a =
Central CA

bus.  it's not the same as a western Wa bus.

Ideally this bus would turn into the perfectly rust free straight =
painted=20
sealed bus. Ya, right, and I just have not spent the time &amp;money on the =
full

resto.   Haven't painted the barndoor either.  In fact, now I am doing =
the=20
student thing again, I wanted to take a bit of time to plug a draft to =
make=20
it more comfortable to drive the bus.  Duh.  I said that in my first =
post on

the subject.  It's a stop gap measure.  I want to keep my beautiful 61 =
on
the=20
road and fairly comfortably drivable.   And it is, with original paint =
and=20
original trinkets on it.  Hm, need to powder coat 15&quot; rims.

 I was thinking about checking the insulation on the long heat tube as =
well.

Next I'll put a rust cover plate on the other side, replace the seals =
over=20
the cab windows, on the cab window scrapers, and roofing tar the roof =
to
make=20
it warmer and keep it from rusting... =20

 But some of us that *do* have shiny, reasonably straight, rust-free
 restored buses have them because we spent the time to replace the
 floor pans and rockers and whatnot.

 The passenger side floor section took me between 2 and 2.5 hours to =

 on the '60.

 Also - do you have the pedal pan on your bus?  It makes a *huge* =
difference
 in draft reduction!

 Although I haven't done it on this bus yet, I found that replacing the
 factory heater tube wrap with foam pipe insulation, as well as =
insulating
 the curved sections fore and aft that are not normally insulated, =
helped
 considerably with heat.
