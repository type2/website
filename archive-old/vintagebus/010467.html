&gt; ...Well, it might be significant, and it might not. At the bottom of the
&gt; adjusting stars are spring clips that keep them from un-adjusting. Many a
time I
&gt; have seen these bent or broken off, so it may be that the one you hear
clacking
&gt; is the only one that has the spring-clip.

And for what it's worth, I've become very adept at fixing these clips by
using spring steel banding material.  I cut out a clip, bend it in the right
places, drill and tap a hole and use a small machine bolt to hold the clips
on.  Almost every clip on my bus is done that way and one for sure on the 74
Super.  It works great!
