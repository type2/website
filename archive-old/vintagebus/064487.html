Subject: Re: [VB] VW Bus Calendar(s)   I need your BEST VW BUS photos 
  and 2003 show details 

Also if you have any dates for your local VW shows please include them and I
will get them on the calendar.   Send your best VW pics (I have to use
submissions) and give me those VW show dates and any details that you have.
Also tell me where the show is!

&gt; The response to the VW calendar that I did for the www.Buskatiers_dot_com has
been
&gt; great  http://204.26.80.78:8084/buskatier2003.pdf    I would like to offer
my
&gt; services to the Vintage Bus group and the Type 2 group.  If you have some
very
&gt; photogeninic VW busses I would love to see them  captoaster_at_cox_dot_net  and
see
&gt; if I can work them into a calendar.  The calendar would be free for the
&gt; download but I would like you to think about donating to the list through
&gt; here.
&gt;  Vintage Bus and Type 2 donations here......
&gt; http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/donate.html   Hope the Admin's don't mind!!   I
am
&gt; hoping they will host it for me!!??
&gt; Thanks and Happy Holidays
