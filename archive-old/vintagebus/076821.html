Subject: Re: [VB] Front door pull handles

I have never broken a pre 66 door handle... the kind you pull the door closed 
with.   However, the pull handles for the 66-67 I find not so sturdy.  Maybe 
becaus ethe plastic was 30+ years old.

I like functionality. It has been stated that the pre-66 opener-handles break 
off after continued use as door-closers. Don't like that. The pull handle is 
simple and practical.
