Hi Edith,
Check out :  http://members.nbci_dot_com/Urapente/5867part/285.png
As you can see the rubber stop drawing part # 8 is pushed and twisted at the 
same time onto drawing part # 43.  If your rear axle tubes have #43 part it 
is a good idea to scrub out as much dirt/rust as possible in around the stem 
piece that the rubber bumper slips onto.  Then coat this area lightly with 
grease to help slip on the rubber bumper and hopefully keep the rust under 
control there.   Eric&amp;Barb
