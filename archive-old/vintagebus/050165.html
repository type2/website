Subject: Yet more WEB SITE updating...


We got in! Yay! The web page I was serving has been pulled down so I don't
get my account cancelled and the official type2_dot_com web page is currently
being synchronized with the new &quot;type2 annex&quot; site. When the ftp finishes
it should all be competely updated except for the library and we'll finish
that up as soon as we can.

As always my profound thanks to Marc Edwards and Arizona Access for putting
up with us.

It shall all be revealed:
