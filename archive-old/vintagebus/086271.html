 &gt;Hi Guys,
 &gt;Here is an adventure. Does anyone have any ideas what they would
 &gt;recommend? My 38 amp generator appears to have malfunctioned. I took a
 &gt;long drive on the freeway for a few hours. I looked down and saw the
 &gt;red light on on the dash. I didn't smell anything so I just pulled off
 &gt;the freeway exit, came to a full stop, ran back to the engine to take
 &gt;a look-see. Nothing was out of the ordinary. The fan belt was fine.
 &gt;The engine temp was normal. The dip stick wasn't too hot to hold. All
 &gt;the wires appeared to be connected. I had replaced the voltage
 &gt;regulator a few weeks earlier as I had upgraded the engine to 12 volt.
 &gt;I removed and replaced the brushes. They appeared to be fine. They
 &gt;were almost the length of new brushes. The commutator was shiney.
 &gt;Again all the wires appeared to be solid and good connections. The red
 &gt;light stayed on. So I bought a rebuilt generator. It came in the mail
 &gt;yesterday. But now the generator light went out and appears to be
 &gt;working fine. The light comes on when
 &gt;I turn the key to the first notch. I start the engine and the light
 &gt;goes out as it should. I did try a test: disconnect the two wires from
 &gt;the generator. Connect a voltmeter to the generator. They registered
 &gt;zero volts. I haven't reconnected the voltmeter to the generator yet
 &gt;again now that the red light has gone out. If I do, I expect it to
 &gt;read what, 13 or 14 volts? Do you think there is a loose connection
 &gt;inside the generator that has reconnected for a while? Is an
 &gt;intermittent charging generator something that anyone has encountered
 &gt;before? Should I just replace the damn thang now, let it fail, or
 &gt;what? Maybe if I hang with it a little longer, I can learn something
 &gt;more about generators. As long as the battery stays strong I'm not 
too worried.
 &gt;Any advice would be appreciated.
 &gt;Thanks in advance,
 &gt;Dave in Pacific Grove, California

I had a problem like that once and it turned out to be a bit of sand 
inside the voltage regulator keeping the little relay from closing 
all the way.  Actually I just replaced the voltage regulator with 
another but went ahead and looked inside the original &quot;bad&quot; one and 
found this.  Not sure how the grit got in there but a bit of cleaning 
and it was good as new.

Anyhow, Speedy Jim has a good generator troubleshooting page:
