Rich brought me down by saying:
&gt;Anyway I went down to Sears and spent $8.95 for a 17mm
&gt;allen wrench.  The problem I had was that I  _could_not_  get an angle to
&gt;get
&gt;it open; I fought with it for a couple of hours before I finally gave up in
&gt;disgust. 


Uh-oh, vv
Where did the Sears allen wrench not fit, Tranny fill plugs or RGBs? Will
the nightmare ever end? :)
