&gt; just go to home depot and buy a heating element for an
&gt; electric hot water heater, or better yet buy a small electric hot water
&gt; heater
&gt; and instal a recirculating pump (also available at home depot) an low
&gt; and behold a hot water parts washer and you control the heat!
&gt;

    A buddy of mine did this...

    For a parts washer, he modified a Harbor Freight bench top sand blast
cabinet for better sealing and a wash wand.

    He uses the hot water heater to circulate Kerosene, most times he sets
the heater at 105 degrees F.

    Works almost as well as the BIG kerosene-fired steam cleaner we used to
have at work, with the enclosed cabinet alot less messy...
