I should have been more clear in my description:) The duct is present
however it is currently capped off with a hose clamp and flexible foil lid
from a can of peanuts. The issue that I am up against is the that the duct
that comes thru the hole in tin is about 2&quot; in diameter ass opposed to the
inlet on the stock 1967 oil bath air cleaner is about 5/8&quot; in diameter. I
need to find a way tho step down the hose from the large size to the
smaller. I guess duct tape would work but.........)

hm, what I would do is feed the small diameter hose down through the metal 
tube.   Make a rubber grommet around the small tube that covers the top of 
the hole and a bit of the rear tin, and make --hm hard to fit something under 
that you could screw the rubber to.  Okay I would super glue the rubber 
grommet to the rear tin.    Cut a circle of thickish rubber, and a hole in 
the circle.  This way it will not fall off the paper pre heat tube.   I would 
leave the metal pre heat pick up in place unless you have an early one.   I 
dislike duct tape in engine compartment- fear it will come loose and get 
sucked into the fan.
