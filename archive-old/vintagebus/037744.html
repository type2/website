&gt; If anyone out there has any ideas on how to make the Sigla emblem
&gt; please email me.
&gt; 

Phil, if you have a copy of the emblem it isn't that hard. You can by the stuff to etch glass at the craft store, the have a kit that you can use to make a template,  I've done it with the chemical method and also using a sandblaster.
