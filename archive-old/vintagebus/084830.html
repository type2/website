&gt;
&gt; I just checked and vwsucks_dot_com has been taken, and is really active.  :(

I think it's the ethylene glycol fumes.  Clearly it is affecting the
engineers and managers at VW AG, and has done so for a long time.  If
they'd leave that nasty stuff out of their cars, they wouldn't have so
many problems.

&gt; toyotasucks_dot_com, hondasucks_dot_com, and nissansucks_dot_com don't exist.  An
&gt; indication of the relative quality of their current products?

All three names are registered, but they don't point anywhere.  One of
them has clearly been registered by a squatter and the other two are
registered to a company in New Jersey that has also registered other
(brand)sucks_dot_com domain names.

Some large companies pre-emptively register (brand)sucks_dot_com names for
their brands.  fordsucks_dot_com is owned by Ford.  gmsucks_dot_com and
chryslersucks_dot_com are owned by the same New Jersey company as above.
