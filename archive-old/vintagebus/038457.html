I didnt' see this posted on the vintagebus list...

Yikes, that casts a new light to think that his bus might have been the tool

Found this in the Ponca City News Online and thought I'd share it. It
doesn't answer too many questions, but it does fill in some gaps.

  Ponca City Man Found in Garage

 ... The body of a 25-year-old Ponca City man was found Monday night in the
garage
  of his home in the 100 block of Warwick Road.
  According to police the body of Josh Rodgers was found after they received
a call
  from a woman at 9 p.m. stating that she had found a man unconscious on the
floor
  of his garage.
  Preliminary police investigation reports state Rodgers apparently died
from carbon
  monoxide poisoning.
