4 Buses?  I missed the rush.

When I swung by, there was *one* - and that was DH's.

I really hope Dean puts on that swap again - it kicks some major ass! (hey,
can I say ass on the computer?)

&gt;On the Saturday of Memorial Day weekend there are head to head SOTO-NEATO

&gt;looked at busses, spent money at the swap, bugged Dean Anderson for a
&gt;Sacramento Samba Society T-shirt (the NEATO chapter) bought raffle tickets
&gt;and was invited to eat with some fellow bus owners.  My Dad wanted to check
&gt;out the Ancil Hoffman meet so we cruised over there.  There were four busses
&gt;at Ancil Hoffman.  Four.  Maybe there were some there earlier, but I could
&gt;never find anyone who would admit to it.
&gt;BTW: The NEATO chapter, Sacramento Samba Society, are the same guys who used
&gt;to be the Sacramento SOTO chapter that hosted the Ancil Hoffman picnic.
