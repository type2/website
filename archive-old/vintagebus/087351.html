&gt;&gt;  A friend just acquired a 67 DC.  I spotted a bug  like break fluid 
reservoir attached to the panel behind the driver seat, just  bellow the VIN Plate 
(it's a RHD, type 268).  Is it stock? Does 67 bus  use different break master 
cylinder than the older ones?   &lt;&lt;
Hi Kermal,
Not stock.  Sounds like a bug or 1968-70 bus MC is being used.   1967 had a 
one year only MC that mounted tot he top of the MC.  You can  also use a 
1972-79 MC, see the type2_dot_com library on how to do that.

&gt;&gt;On the rear gate, there is something attached to the inner part  of the 
gate that when it is open, you can use it as push-step (or it is) to  climb-up 
the bed.  Does this explain M-code 363?   &lt;&lt;
Since that is stock on all rear tail gates it is not an Mcode item.   Yes it 
is a step up into the bed.
