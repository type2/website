He, Soon they'll gone, and you'll be worrying 'bout them! It could be
worse.

&gt; Had a bit of a scare when one of
&gt; the studs turned into the case because the nut was hanging on it, but I
&gt; fashioned a grabber by cutting a slit out of a spare nut and clamping it
&gt; to the stud with vise-grips (to avoid mangling the threads).  Backed it
&gt; out and cleaned it up, reinserted with loctite.

You sure you're NOT a pro??? It's taken me thirty years to be able to
figure out creative solutions to problems! (but I haven't done too badly
along the way).
