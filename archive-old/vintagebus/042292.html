Got yetanother odd one.

Its been happening since I started running this bus, generally randomly.
But today I was able to do it on demand, and found out when it does it.

Ok, what it does:  The damn silverbox relay will start clicking
occasionally.  Sometimes completely randomly, othertimes when....

I hit 3900 RPM.  Today, everytime I hit the ol mark below 4 grand, the box
would start clicking.  Anbd the futher up I went the faster the box
clickclacked!

No lights are affected during these tantrums, just the box
clackclackclickclicking.


It still does it randomly at other times, though only with the engine
running...


any ideas anyone? (all stock 6v.....)

thanks...david
