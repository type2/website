First off, the color swatches on my site can only be considered a slight
approximation of the color.  By the time the scanner, jpeg compression,
your video card and monitor are done with it, who knows what you have.

BTW, I didn't see your bus listed in the registry with the color.

&gt;The guy at the paint shop where I ordered 3 quarts of a match to the radio
&gt;blockoff plate  (Pearl White) (oh, and it wasn't faded or oxidized) told me
&gt;that it would be better to go with a base/clear coat system as it is harder
&gt;to screw that up.  But the one of the colors I wanted could not be made in
&gt;base/clear, so he said I'd have to go with single-stage, which is harder.
&gt;Why is it harder, and are there any pieces of info that I can let my mind
&gt;chew on while I'm prepping?  How can I avoid screwing this up?

You can screw up basecoat clearcoat.   It's just slightly easier to recover
from.  The screwup would be getting orange peel.   Trust me, I'm the king
of orange peel.  A clear coat gives you something to wet-sand.

You get the same benefit by putting on more single stage.  Painting a bus
is a LOT of work.  You have to do it TWICE using base/clear.   I only
recommend it if you're really going for the last inch for a show car.
