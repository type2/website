Tristan and I took our first camping trip in the '67 Westy!   Just a 24 hour
trip... Went 65 miles East up on the Cascade mountains...  Left town at
10:00pm and were at our camp spot 1:30am... fired up the white gas stove and
had a great steak at 2:00am ... nothing like hot food in absolute silence
and 30 degree temps :)

I was going to visit Home Depot and see if I could come up with a
inexpensive solution to replace my bug screens with Plexiglas ... I notice a
lot of drafts in the bus at 60 / 65MPH... especially in the mountains with
side winds and 30 degree temps :)  Anyone have advice on this, done it
yourself?

My engine is breaking in nicely... third oil change (now at 1800 miles) and
set valves before trip.  Engine is no longer doggy and gas mileage is up a
bit... but my fuel gauge went out (so now I am looking for two good 12v fuel
gauges... my truck one is missing.... anyone going to the show next week
that has some for sale at decent price?).  On level ground oil temps are
steady 225 at 65MPH... on mountain hills they go up as high as  248... these
temps might sound high, but I've been doing a lot of study on oil temp over
the last 6 months (with three different engines) and I find again and again
that these seem to be pattern for 1600DP (doghouse cooler) engines when you
are at 60 / 65MPH for AT LEAST 30 MINUTES...   it takes that long before it
really levels off.  And this with a VDO dipstick sender that is reading oil
temp with mix of before and after oil cooler... so it tends to read hotter
than some other senders.  My goal is to get those temps down another 5 to 10
degrees... I have some tin enhancements and seals to work on.
