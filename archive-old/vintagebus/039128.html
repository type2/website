Subject: [VB] turning over but no start

i'll try to lay out all the pertinent facts and information.  i do hope that
i've not left anything important out.

after starting my single cab several times and driving it around and then
finally driving it home a few weeks ago i have been unable to get it to
start.  first the problem was with the starter.  it sounded to me as if it
were dragging.  i hooked up a starter relay/booster and that improved
matters a bit but not enough.  then i installed a new starter along with the
relay (might as well, i thought) and cleaned the grounds at battery/body and
tranny/body (prolly should have done that first).  wow what a difference but
still no start.

so sunday morning a buddy and i tried a more cooperative approach.  i'm sure
that the gas tank is empty and the filter was pretty dry so we poured gas
into the carb but nothing - not even the gas fart that it should have had.
we checked the distributor and it's firing as it should.  so my buddy
checked to see if there was spark coming through the wires to the plugs.
this appears to be where the problem lies as there is no spark at the plug
end of the wires.  but i'm not so sure this is indeed the problem:  the
thing we can't get over is the fact that i drove it home.

the only thing that i've changed since driving it home is the late model
(water-cooled?) distributor cap for a correct cap just this past saturday
morning along with the starter and addition of the relay.  the engine has
about 20,000 miles on it and was newly converted from 12 volts to 6.  all
the 6 volt stuff (with the exception of the choke), wires and plugs have
about 15 miles on them.

of course i'm still pumped up from driving it home and i almost don't mind
the fact that i can't get it started now but every so often i think that i
could be driving it right now and how good that would feel.

it's got a few of us stumped.  any ideas?

cheers,
