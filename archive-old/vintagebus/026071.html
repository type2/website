It is my understanding that auto glass is not available in the correct
thickness... Is this not so?

I have had experience with new ones from Wolfsburg West, and unlike most
of their products, I was unimpressed. They were a hair too short and a
hair too narrow, when we compared them to the originals. Thickness was
fine, but they just didnt fit right.

I have &quot;blindex&quot; windshields in my 65, and have been lead to believe
these were a replacement available for a time in the 80's. Anyone know
for sure?
