Subject: SS brake lines for a 66 bus????

I'm a firm advocate/believer in SS brake lines to replace the OEM rubber
lines that often cause problems with age.  Rob Kuhn of the VintagVW list
kind of got me turned on to them and I'll never go back to the OEM ones.

I was looking in the bugpack catalog for the lines (since I can get anything
bugpack shipped to me within a day) and didn't see them.  Phil Cram of Cram
Foreign Auto in Omaha verified that Bugpack doesn't make SS lines for a bus.

I was wondering, if the metric fittings are all the same, would a person be
able to compare a set of OEM '66 bus rubber brake lines to a set of bugpack
lines and use a set for a bug that closely matched the length of a bus?  I'm
unfamilier with how a bus is setup so maybe there are some greater lengths
involved than what a bug ever had?

Anyone have any ideas on this?
