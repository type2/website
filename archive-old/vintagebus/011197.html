Subject: Where is the pre 66 In-N-Out bus?

Reading my stepdaughter's work mag from In-N-Out;

&quot;Jon has been a part of In-N-Out Burger since 1966, when Harry Snyder first 
contacted him to make signs for the company.&quot;
&quot;Jon's first job was to put a sign on Harry's old Volkswagen work truck. 
Harry wanted the letters printed backwards on the front so that when he was 
driving behind cars on the road they would be able to read the sign in their 
rear view mirror.&quot;

So In-N-Out had a VW truck (singlecab)? Pre 1966, where is it now with its 
neat decals?
