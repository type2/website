&gt; friday topic i suppose. I lived in Oregon for a short time and i was aware of
&gt; their gas pumping situation, you cannot pump your own gas. Attendant must do
&gt; it. I was curious to any stories the list have about how they deal ,     &lt;snip&gt;

I'm sure they would not mind if your opened your own engine lid (if ya got a
barndoor) and point to the gas cap.  They do let you out of your car.  A local
told me once they have mandatory gas attendants as job security.  Creates jobs.
Makes sense I guess.
