Subject: RE: [VB] Pointers Needed

Hey, if you want one of them weimaranererer things, come and steal the one
from my neighbors as they keep it out side and it barks all night long....

As per the front end shim alignment, either get a short digital level that
measures degrees or a plumb bob.

Anyway, this weekend i'm going to install new spindles, link pins, tie rod
assemblies and possible change the torsion arm seals. The bentley looks
pretty straight forward but I am a little confused about the shim/degree
measurement thing. What do I need to do all of this?
