Part of finding the deal is knowing enough to ask. OK,
Greg. I will give you $400. &lt;bus and tent&gt; and pick it
up myself thereby saving you the hassle. Pmail to
confirm our deal.

How does this benefit me?? He *gave* me his running
'65 DD, walk thru EZ camper. It needs some body work
on the drivers side. But that's about it. I'm going
down to pick it up Sunday. I'm giving him $300 and
he's throwing in the tent as well...
