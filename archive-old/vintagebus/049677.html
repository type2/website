Subject: jetting a 30/31

OK, i have been tuning the H30/31 I RE installed in the bus, and have some
more questions for the List...
I HAD a 28Pict1 which I LOVED, but it began to leak too much air through
the shaft. I had this same 30/31 in before, and was getting TEN mpg, so I
yanked it; have cleaned and scrubbed it, jets are as follows:
main 112.5
air correction  130z
30/31s have TWO extra jets, an idle and a pilot. They sit one behind the
other on the right side, noone seems to know which is which, or what the
pilot does. For now, the forward jet is 91.65, other one is 91.5.
1600 SP, 009 for now, stock muffler. Fuel pump rod is SLIGHTLY below stock
height to lower pressure a tad - recently done, as it was the first thing I
thought of when I saw i was using too much fuel.

Car runs OK (once I fixed a head intake leak), BUT pours fuel into the
exhaust at idle, and gets 12 mpg. This is unacceptable. Esp. since my tires
are 10% too small, so that mpg is 11.
Lewis maintains that a 1600 shouldn't even MOVE on 112.5, that a 122.5 is
better - I just see more gas being dumped.
Now, VWs actually CRUISE on the idle circuit, so I would assume that too
small a main would make it too lean at speed, but I drove it to 72 mph with
no trouble, no overheating, no stumbling. Perhaps the 130 emulsion tube is
masking that (spec should be a 140 emulsion... the higher the number, the
more AIR the emulsion tube flows; this is the opposite of the main jet).

I need to check the pump pressure this wekend... anyone running these carbs
wanna report theit jet sizes/mpg?
