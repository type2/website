&gt; &gt;I wonder if the answer to your desires isn't a wasserboxer bottom end?

&gt; no. i HAVE a nearly-complete (and unassembled) 1700, but the effort
&gt; to get it in a baywindow or a split is more than i want to prank with.
&gt; not to mention the glories of all the head troubles the T4 crowd moan about!
&gt; what i want is an indestructable bottom end, to which i can attach
&gt; the relatively-inexpensive consumables of T1 p/c and heads!

The wasserboxer case can have the water jackets cut off and then be used
with type 1 pistons, heads and cylinders to build a type 1 aircooled
engine that bolts right up.  IIRC, the cylinder stud holes have to e
relocated (though I think that offset studs would be easy to implement)
and an external oil cooler has to be plumbed for the aircooled
application.

Food for thought.
