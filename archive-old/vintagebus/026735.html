&lt;&lt;   Also how much have people seen side steps going for.  Sorry for that
question, I'm sure I'll get heckled, I just haven't been to a swap meet or
ever seen one for sale but have one!   I've heard they've never been
supplied by the aftermarket..

You heard wrong, there are a few repros.

Last time I had some originals, I sold them for $75 each and they were sold
before I pulled them out of my car, this was about 4 years ago.
