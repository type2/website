&gt; I guess I have been lucky, I took a deposit for the 62panel and gave them 3

&gt; clearly defined as non-refundable. I also sent a deposit to the gentelmen I
&gt; bought the 59 single cab from and he assured me that not to worry as he's
&gt; had it for years and will not sell it to another buyer. The same goes with
&gt; my other recent purchase I  sent a good will deposit as I bought this bus
&gt; site unseen and the owner honored his original selling price even though he
&gt; was informed it was worth 2 to 3 times the selling price by others who tried
&gt; to purchase it, my point, there are still good and honest people out there
&gt; who honor their word, but we will see what happens as I need to make 2 major

I've noticed that VW folks tend to be more honest and reliable than the
general public.  Unfortunately, with the increasing value and rarity of
our vehicles, more shady characters are coming into the picture.  Residing
in SoCal doesn't help my impression much either!

A lot has to do with the person on the other end of the transaction.  If
someone is known to me (like a long-time list member) I would tend to
trust them a lot further than a random phone caller.

My basic philosophy remains the same though.  I don't like to be keep
transactions half-done for very long, and I doubt that anyone else likes
it either.  Cash makes no enemies!
