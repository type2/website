Sean,

Gimme a break.  I loved that Bug put tons of milage on it and it went =
through 5 sons, actually 6, because one of their friends drove it for 8 =
months too. =20

My Sweet Bus is a '66 Body with a '63 sunroof and the PO stupidly put in a =
second set of cargo doors on the driver side.  Not purrfect, but decent =
job, decent body.  I am trying to get a set of Kelly's belly pans welded =
in, but it is a major job.  I thought the price included labor, but Kelly =

&gt; Muh 20 year old just called me.  He has been using
&gt; my '74 Burnt Orange &quot;Phoenix Red&quot; Bug that I
&gt; restored back in 1990, because his '97 Buick Skylark
&gt; won't pass emissions.  He just blew a rod through
&gt; the side of my 1600 dual port.

&gt; RATS!  I do have the old 1600 dp out of my bus when
&gt; I put in the 1835 Bergmann.  But still, the thought
&gt; of it!  Now we have to fix up the old 1600, I am
&gt; sure it needs new rear main seals.  It leaked oil
&gt; like a sieve.  It could have been the dog house
&gt; cooler though.
&gt;=20
&gt; sympathy, anyone?
