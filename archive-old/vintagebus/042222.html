Hardware:  Stock '71 bus electrical system.  38amp generator.

A few days ago I had a generator light, so I replaced the brushes.  I
though this odd as the brushes were only a year old and about half worn
out.  The new brushes fixed the light problems, so I counted the problem
as fixed.

During the 400 mile drive yesterday, I noted the voltage as being rather
low, dipping as low as 12.0V (measured while driving from a circuit direct
from the battery).  Turning the headlights on made no difference in the
voltage, so the generator was putting out.  The night section of the trip
came along and the voltage increased to 12.7V.  Upon getting to Carson
City (and my Dad's house) I was shocked to see voltage of 11.7V, but the
generator light was still out.  I checked the generator, and the brushes
were almost completely worn out!  I shut the engine down and restarted,
and now the generator light stays on.

Review of symptoms:
1. Low voltage (12.0-12.5V) but still charging.
2. Very rapid brush wear.

Any list wisdom on a possibe cause?

I was planning to switch to an alternator, but I was saving that job for
the next time the engine was out.  It looks like I might be doing that job
a bit sooner than expected!

I'll have to resolve this before I go anywhere, but I have a week here to
work on it, and I have transportation.

Any suggestions of VW parts places in the Reno/Carson City Nevada area?
I'll probably need a complete alternator conversion kit and the tool to
remove the filler from the generator stand.

Any suggestions welcomed!

George Lyle
