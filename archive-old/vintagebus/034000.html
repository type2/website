&lt;&lt; First off, how does one remove the key cylinder from the ignition switch?  
 Ive pulled mine off, and looked all over for little screws to loosen, but I 
 can't find any.  I need to find out the code so I can get a key made. &gt;&gt;
Hi Mike,
The code should be stamped on the base of the ignition switch.  Never on the 
tumbler, this is even true of the exterior locking handles.  Eric&amp;Barb
