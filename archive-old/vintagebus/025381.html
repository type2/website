       To reiterate one more time, you need to set the 009 to at least
10 degrees BTDC initial advance, and you need to either (a) buy a crank
pulley with degrees on it (make sure it's the stock diameter), or (b)
measure out the degrees and file a new notch or make a paint strip on
your old pulley.
      Stock pulleys vary as to timing notches -- but I think 3 of them
should be 7.5, 5, 0, reading clockwise. So you need to make a make
counterclockwise from the first one equal to the distance between the
first two, or 2.5 degrees left. Then forget the timing light, just set
it statically -- pull the coil wire off the dizzy, turn on the
ignition,  have the pulley lined up exactly with the new 10 degree mark
at the case center crack, and turn the dizzy back and forth until you
get a nice spark from the coil wire.
