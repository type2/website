Markus,
Deck height is the distance between the top of the cylinder and the top of
the piston at the top of the stroke.   There is usually on a stock VW engine
a small
area of dead space here.  About .035-.045&quot; on stock motors from what I've
seen.  It can be alot different if the spigot holes have been decked etc.
Every engine is different so you have to measure this everytime you put one
together just to make sure.  There are several ways to measure it.  The
cheapest is to lay a vertical piece of metal across the cylinder and
measure.  You can slip various size gauges in until you determine the gap.
This isn't very good though.  The best way is to clamp the cylinder in place
under a normal torque setting.  There is a tool I use that is fairly cheap
that is a thick square metal plate about 1/2' thick.  It comes with a screw
that can be used.  THe screw turns a certain amount of a turn per .005 or
whatever.  I use the tool using a dial indicator, subtract the amount of the
plate and that's it.  I guess it's just called a deck height measuring tool.
They aren't very expensive as I recall.
This is only half of the measuring you have to do.  You have to measure the
amount of volume in each of the heads.  This is usually done by using a
plexiglas plate in the bore of the head and filling the void with a measured
number of ccs of water or whatever.  I usually use isopropanol/water as it
wets the surfaces better than just water.  Then you are able to know the
amount of volume that your stroke is compressed into.  Not to get off topic
but there used to be a very good article about it with all formulas on this
on site.  You can get the same information pretty much from the Berg
technical articles but it's going to cost you some.  Money well spent
though.  You have to have the tools to do it, but they aren't real fancy
stuff.  There are formulas to do this and you can just plug in your numbers.
I would never build an engine nowdays without setting up the compression.
In older days you could get away with it more easily.  If you have a new
case and new heads you probably could get away with it, but you never know.
You can punch in the numbers at that website and see, but I'm thinking that
would be making some assumptions about your engine that may not be true.
