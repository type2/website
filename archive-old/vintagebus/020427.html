Did I miss the group picture of all the tools and spare parts? I was
mostly interested in seeing all the pullers. How many different ones you
use or need, which ones they are, etc. Is hazet the best brand for
pullers? I'd like to get a few for general bus maintenance and would like
to know which ones are neccessary. ( for RGBs, tie rods, steering
wheels,etc.) Thanks

&gt; i carry just about any tool i may need to rebuild or fix anything on 
&gt; the
&gt; bus, minus the tranny itself.  i have pullers of all kinds and 
&gt; specialty
&gt; applications, and all socket/wrench sizes for everything on the 
&gt; entire
&gt; vehicle.  i usually have a large floorjack, but right now it is 
&gt; broken.  i
&gt; also carry a large plastic crate full of every imagineable spare 
&gt; part--all
&gt; wheelbearings and reduction box bearings (enough to do the entire 
&gt; car if
&gt; they all went at once), generator bearings, an extra oil cooler, a 
&gt; spare
&gt; generator (complete), spare coil, spare carbs, brake cylinder kits, 
&gt; fuel
&gt; pumps and rebuild kits, brake hoses, triplicates of all needed 
&gt; gaskets and
&gt; seals, fuses, bulbs, even a few distributors too.  one thing i 
&gt; hardly hear
&gt; anyone mention is an OIL PRESSURE SENDER.  if this starts to leak or
&gt; breaks, you're dead in the water.  carry a spare!  i also carry a
&gt; tach/dwell meter, a MAC oil pressure gauge, compression gauge, and a
&gt; volt/ohm meter. i've even carried spare tie rod assemblies when i 
&gt; used to
&gt; go to Utah alot. plus the usual dash tray full of hose clamps, 
&gt; generator
&gt; brushes, wire brushes, screws, spare lengths of wire and terminal 
&gt; ends.  to
&gt; me it's better safe than stranded.  i'd rather have to fix my bus on 
&gt; the
&gt; side of the road than have to pay to have it towed to an unknown 
&gt; shop and
&gt; &quot;fixed&quot; by a local &quot;expert&quot;.

&gt; &gt; I bet there's a lot of other stuff I am not thinking of. Please 
&gt; fill
&gt; &gt; me in so I don't need to go bugging the AIRS types along the way. 
&gt; They
&gt; &gt; will appreciate it, and so will I,
