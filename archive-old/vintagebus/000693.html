&lt;&lt; What color was the front turn signal inner lens for 1962 and 1963 model 
year 
 USA spec splitties? &gt;&gt;
Hi Tom,
Good question.  Our 1962 SO-34 has clear, and our 1963 (DEC 62) has yellow 
signals that are painted yellow inside.  Pretty sure these are the originals 
for these two.   Eric&amp;Barb
