Just wanted to invite any and all in the Phoenix area to Southmountain Park on
Sunday.  The Arizona Bus Club has 'Ramada 3&quot; reserved (with a beer permit) and
we'll just be getting together to &quot;eat, drink, and be merry&quot; for a while.  We
have about 25 pounds of ribs to cook but those who come need to provide side
dishes and such.  Oh......and....drinks of your choosing.  We've got the place
reserved from 9 AM on but aren't really planning on being there until around 2
or 3 PM.  So,,, if you want to get out of the seasonal shopping madness for a
bit, you're more than welcome, even if you aren't an ABC member.
