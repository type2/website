Hi Michael,
Yes, and no.  The Judson worked all of the time due to it's mechanical 
nature.  If you are going to use an electric motor instead it is very much 
more likely to have problems running much sooner.  Which is a big reason why 
we do not have electrical cooling fan for our engines.  Also since Judson was 
used all the time you had to increase the main jet size to keep up with the 
larger air flow.  If you use the electrical supercharger off, and on you will 
either have to run the engine very rich and suffer bad MPG and lower HP than 
stock, plus possibly washing out the rings while it is off.  Or have it run 
very lean when you run the electrical super charger causing burnt valves and 
detonation.  Or come up with some way to change the fuel output of the carb 
when you engage/disengage the electrical supercharger from the drivers seat!
