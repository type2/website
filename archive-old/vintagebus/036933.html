&lt;&lt; Was working on the 67 pop top westy and it ate up a wheel bearing.  
Outside 
 one on drivers side.  The inner ring on the bearing decided to become one 
 with the spindle.  I've been working on cutting it off but then my grinder 
 broke.  So now im at my house with no grinder and that damn bearing ain't 
 coming off!  My brother was hoing to take it to BBBIV which would be his 
 FIRST bus event.  Just trying to find someone in Phoenix who would be 
willing 
 to come over and help if possible.  I'm desperate!
  &gt;&gt;
hope you have sorted this out by now.   I get the races out by using a flat 
punch and a hammer and tap from the other side- there are two gaps where you 
can access the edges of the race.   Wipe grease out to see.   Hope this helps
