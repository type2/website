Barring any instrumented evidence to the contrary, I'd be skeptical.  The
stock shrouds show a lot of effort in directing the air to the places
where it is needed.  Lots of little fins, vanes, etc.

The Porsche shrouds I've seen lack thise refinements, so I suspect that
they rely more on the brute force approach which can lead to overcooling
of certain parts of the engine.
