Subject: Schofield sheet metal problem.

Hi,

Just finished cutting off the lower nose sheet metal on my
64. I purchased the
Schofield metal hearing that it is good quality. Well. The
lower piece that fits behind
the bumper is about 2-1/4&quot; shorter than the original piece
in my bus and it has a lip
that is supposed to attach to the the lip on the upper
piece. The original lower piece
fits up behind the nose sheet. The original nose sheet has a
lip at its lower edge. Then
bent around the lip is another piece that then extends
another 1/2&quot; or so down and is spot
welded to the face of the lower sheet metal.

Anyway, the Schofield stuff just doesn't look right.  Is the
Wolfsburg metal a better
reproduction of the original stampings and foldings?

Thom, you just did the nose on your bus ( the pictures
encouraged me to finally
dive in and start the job ). I think you said that you used
Wolfsburg metal and that you
were happy with it. Is it a repro of the original or does it
just look close when it is
all welded up?

Chris.
