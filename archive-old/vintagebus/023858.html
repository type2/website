I definitely have to agree with Clara on that one.  I have been in search of  a
speedo with trip odometer for my '65 Single cab for quite some time and I can't
remember all the people (some on the list) who said they had one or knew where one
could be gotten from only to get no where.  One things for sure I'll definitely
cherish that puppy when I finally get it.
