actually they now have DISPOSABLE INSTANT cameras. They go for about 20
dollars and  picture comes out the side and then you just chuck the whole
camera.

(I'm game if my single gets done in the next month like its supposed to)


&gt;&gt; Anyone know how much those instant polaroid cameras cost?  Maybe we could
&gt;&gt; all chip in and buy two of them to be passed from bus to bus (heck, use
the
&gt;&gt; cameras as the baton).  That way, 1 or 2 pictures could be taken of the
&gt;&gt; participant and their bus for each leg of the rally and passed along.
