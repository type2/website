hey all,
not to bring up a sore subject or anything, as I hear he was a wonderful
guy, but I've read some of his postings in the library and was
wondering....
who ever got Josh Roder's bus? and are there pics up on the net?

I think I got into the whole VW thing just after he got out :(

thanks
Isaiah
