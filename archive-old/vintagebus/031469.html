Subject: Re: [VB] jalousie window seals / westy cooler

weekend I hope to pick up a '67 Westy interior (minus the cooler). If
&gt; anyone has a westy cooler/ice box/fridge laying around that they would like
&gt; to sell, let me know. It doesn't have to be the exact year.
&gt; 
&gt; thanks,

Wayne,

There is a difference between walk through and bench models.  Which one
do you need?  BTW unfortunately I don't have an extra right now.

Steve
