Subject: re truck bumpers

Yes;-- there is a truck and a bus rear bumper, but not for all years and
not for all slash bumpers--hard to tell the diff unless you put it on a
truck or have the two different bumpers on top of each other like they
were making little bumpers!! vw part numbers i THINK are the same
--truck or bus-- i THINK all pointed rear bumpers are the same--
but then i have been wrong before--i THINK it was in 1979 when i moved
to Phoenix--BUT if i am wrong--i KNOW for sure i'll hear about it from
the vintage list!!
you can with a little help from a grinder &quot;convert&quot; a bus bumper to a
truck bumper,  on my Hearse i'm told the rear bumper is incorrect!! it
is a bus bumper!--yet from what i'm told from Germany where &quot;Drakula'
came from--this IS the bumper that was on the truck when it left the
factory in 1963!!  my feeling --blame it on the vw guy who hung it on
the truck to start with--or &quot;EL NINO&quot;      uncle jerry
63 vw hearse &quot;drakula&quot;
67 hippy bus  &quot;bessie&quot;
vintsge vws--drive um!!
see ya-all jan 23-24 BBB3
