Hi Walt,
While I fully support that you can paint your own bus any color you darn
well please...if you're planning on selling the bus quickly, you might want
to consider going with a stock color. When I see buses for sale that are
freshly painted and custom colors, I wonder how much of the price is in the
paint job that I don't really want. You could save that paint for the bus
you really want. Just a thought...meant to be helpful!
