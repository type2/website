&lt;&lt; Until, of course, said brakes overheat and lose all stopping power.  &gt;&gt;

This is known as &quot;brake fade&quot;, and is a very real phenomenon.  Once your 
brake drums overheat and expand to the point that the shoes can't touch them, 
you're in real trouble!  I had this happen to me when I was driving my father 
and other family members down a long hill in a 1964 Rambler Ambassador, and 
it's no fun.  Use your engine as a brake on long downhills unless you don't 
value the contents of your vehicle!  I even had to stop on a long hill 
outside Los Alamos years ago in a Volvo (with disk brakes all around) 
carrying my favorite nephew and niece, a canoe on top, and my sailboat on a 
trailer behind when I could smell my brakes.  Safeguard your loved ones; use 
engine braking in severe situations!!!!
