Subject: Booger in nosecone, still picking at it...

Hello again Volks,

After doing a little research in the library and reading some old posts in the archives, I am almost convinced that my tranny problem is due to a misalignment between the hockey stick and those thingies in the nosecone. I haven't actually done anything about it, because it's pretty cold and nasty out there and I'm still waiting on some advice, but I'm running out of time.

I was just wondering if it is possible to loosen up the mounts, lift the engine and tranny on a floorjack, and get to the nosecone without actually having to pull EVERYTHING out...

jes wunderin,
dave
