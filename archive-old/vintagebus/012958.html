&quot;Wife says I can work on my VW's but, She gets equal time and money.
Saturday is mine Sunday is hers.  I spend $500 on the bus, she gets $500.
It's all fair in love and VW's&quot;

if that was the case i would be broke! you would finish your bus in half the
time if it wasn't for this... not really FAIR, more LOVE on your part.
sounds like you r wife is a little teeny bit jealous. she should be just as
excited as your are about your VWs. she's gonna love when you need that new
GEX motor :)
