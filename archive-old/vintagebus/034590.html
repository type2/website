 Could I just use the stock oil cooler for a 1500, just to keep things simple?
 I live in NW Indiana where it rarely gets over 85 degrees, would this set up
 work well enough? &gt;&gt;
Hi Jeff,
Well if you said that it never got over 60F we would say &quot;Yes.&quot;.  The
advantage of using the doghouse cooler is that the cooling air to #4 and even
more importantly #3 cylinder is not preheated by passing through the earlier
oil cooler.  The early oil cooler is designed to drop the oil temp by up to
50F and that adds up to alot of hot air.  If you are going to drive only
around town or to shows occasionly then you might do all right, but if you are
going to do some serious driving of your bus on highways and byways then the
doghouse cooler is the way to go.  Once you get all the dog house pieces
together it will not be that more difficult to work with than the earlier set
up.  The only difference is when installing the engine we leave off the two
exaust tubes from the dog house cooler and then with this space available
install the upper left nut that mounts the engine to the tranny.  Once the nut
is tightened then you install the exaust tubes that need only a bolt on one
and a nut on the other.  Pratice first this exaust tube installation when the
engine is out of the VW and then when you mount the engine things will go
easly.  Eric &amp; Barb
