Subject: listee meeting report

curt conklin, fellow listee, and i were both attending functions put on by our work-related association.  we were going to have dinner together but failed to connect after i got lost and disorientated in the rain.  however, we did get together the next day for breakfast.

we talked shop and people (work) and talked vws and vw people.  we also shared photos and stories.  for having a non-show bus, curt's bus sure is nice looking not to mention an interesting feat of engineering as it's a '66 with a 23 window section made into a double door walk through.  curt as gotten belly pans from kelly (metwiz) which will make the bus less wobbly once they are welded in place.

after curt feels his bus is safe to drive, i hope that he'll bring his bus and himself to one of the campouts.  curt is a delightful man despite the fact that we share the same occupation.  &lt;grin&gt;  meeting him and sharing food, stories and pictures became the high point of this business trip.

cheers,
Rachel, Monterey CA			http://www.stanford_dot_edu/%7Erahaha/pig.html
