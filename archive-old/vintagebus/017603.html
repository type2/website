Subject: Split bus windshield wipers
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

This is something that has been bothering me since I
first got a VW with the early style windshield wipers.

Has anyone come up with a good substitute wiper arm
that can be used on a split window bus that would
accept readily available (meaning cheap or affordable)
wiper blades?
I really hate to spend $30 or so every couple of years
to replace wiper blades just so I can see where I am
going when it is raining, especially when I may only
need them a couple of times in the life of the blades.
 I bought some cheap blades once, and the rubber
rotted away over the winter while it sat in the
garage, so I have gotten German blades since then, but
they seem to get more and more expensive every time I
need to replace them, and of course aren't something
that a local FLAPS would stock if you needed some
right away.
I'd keep a stock set up hidden away to put on the bus
whenever I went somewhere that I felt the truck should
look proper, but I'm looking for a substitute for
daily use.
Any one with experiences to share?
