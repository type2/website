&lt;&lt;  and all these people are as unique and diversive in their interests as 
everyone else I know (of). &gt;&gt;

Yeah, I have a friend who used to star in a series on TV who casually asked 
about buying a bus a while back.  If he'd kept up his interest, I would have 
been glad to help him get one.  What's the big deal?

We might love 'em, but they're still just vehicles, and you can do whatever 
you want to a vehicle if it's yours.
