Subject: Fog lights wanted
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com


I would like to find some amber (preferred) or clear fog/driving lights.  
Since it is for my Binz I'll be a vintage nazi, so no reproductions 
considered.  Prefer Hella or Bosch but any 50's or 60's light considered.  
Cash or parts to trade including some cool stuff.  

Thanks,
Dan
