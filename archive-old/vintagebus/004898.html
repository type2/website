&gt;Go back and see if there is a sending unit on the speedometer where the
cable
&gt;is attached.  Sometimes it has HELLA stamped on it.  When this unit senses
&gt;the speedo cable is rotating in the reverse direction it activates the
lights.


Hot diggity!  A few years ago I snagged some reverse lights from an early 68
bug and I have since sold them to a guy in California.  To my knowledge, the
bug still sits in the junkyard almost totally plucked of everything.  I
never did check the speedo but I sure will now.  Thanks!
