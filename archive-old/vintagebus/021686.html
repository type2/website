Fellow Listees -

Since I have been trying for the last few hours to get to type2_dot_com for the
archives and been unsuccessful, I will ask you all directly.  I have
completely dismantled the rear brakes on my 66, and was wondering since I
had everything apart, if I should r&amp;r the reduction boxes.

not unless something is wrong with them.    What sort of pplay is there in
them?  if any?   with the wheel s off the ground rotate the wheel- feeel
smooth or some play?   lift the axle at the nut up/ down- it should not
wiggle there.

  I plan to get
some major transmission work do in the next few weeks, but that should not
affect the workings of the redux boxes, should it?

if you are getting a tranny swap the axles will have to come apart and off-
so that is a perfect time to replace anything that needs it.

 I plan on keeping them,
but I want them to be prepared for the high speeds (60-65 mph) at which I
will be travelling.

what gearing is in your tranny?   what tranny work are you getting done?
Driving with the others splitties in a caravan Sunday afternoon at 65mph I
could hear some whining of motors, especially the one with the low profile
tires.  I was at 3300rpms.  But the lower gearing is better on hills.

  Essentially, I was going to replace the metal brake
tubes, but the discovered that the cylinders were not functioning, so I
removed the drums to take care of the cylinders.  When I got the drums off,
I discovered that the emergency brake cables were not connected properly, so
I decides to fix that problem as well.  Now that I have gotten so far as to
take the backing plates off to get them sandblasted and recoated (power
coated? or zinc coated? or POR15?), I thought why not go the whole way and
take care of the rb's too!

because then you pull the engine and tranny and it is a real PITA and you
have barely started.  Get out your bentley manual and read the tranny removal
section, and the section on removing the RGBs/axle tubes/axles, and look in
the archives and read what I did to my 65 westy in November.
