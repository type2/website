 I've noticed in past postings (and associated Sermons) you've mentioned
 sourcing parts from JCW.  Have you had any experience with their rebuild
 kits?  Prices seem reasonable, but I'm worried this might be a case of
 &quot;You get what you pay for...&quot;, rather than &quot;They're a great value...&quot;
 (whatever that means..??).
  &gt;&gt;

Nick,

Don't buy a VW engine overhaul 'kit' from J.C.Whitney... nor from anyone else,
for that matter.

Read the ad more closely.  The operative word is 'STOCK'.  (&quot;Stock Replacement
Rebuild Kit') and 'std.'  which means &quot;standard&quot; and speaks to your connecting
rod, crankshaft and cam bearings.  The 'gotcha!' is that you can only use
standard-size bearings in a new crankcase and on a standard-size (ie,
unground) crankshaft.  

So... what size are the journals on your crankshaft?  Howzabout the main-
bearing bores on your crankcase?  Do your rods need to be rebuilt?  Howz yer
cam?  Is the distributor-gear worn?  Any of your lifters gone flat?  (Does the
sun rise in the east? :-) 

Being 1,300 miles from you, I can't say precisely what those sizes are but I
can tell you what they ARE NOT... they are not 'std'.  Which means the thirty
bucks-worth of bearings in the rebuild-kit won't fit your engine.  

(Except for the cam bearings.  Your cam turns at one-half the speed of the
crankshaft.  Chances are, your old cam bearings might still be within spec and
could be re-used... in a pinch.  But since a set of cam bearings only costs
five bucks it's standard practice to replace them.) 

The JCW overhaul kit includes four new intake valves ($4 each), four new
exhaust valves ($7 each), and eight valve guides ($2).  (And the odds are,
your old intake valves are still within spec, needing only a re-grind.)  But
before you can use any of this stuff you must dismantle your heads and check
them for cracks between the spark-plug hole and the valves.  If you have dual-
port heads they are usually cracked in this area; if single-port, they are
cracked about half the time.  That means you need replacement heads, which
means any money spent on valves or guides is wasted. If you buy new heads
(about $125 each), they come complete with new guides, new valves, new
springs, keepers and so forth.

Even if your heads are NOT cracked... are you equipped to replace the valve
guides?  Do you have the set of stones and tools and the diamond facer needed
to regrind the valve seats?  Simply replacing the valve will do no good at
all.  In fact, it would make matters worse.  The valve, the guide and the
valve-seat form a set.  The seat is ground concentric to the guide and the new
valve is lapped to mate with the re-ground seat.

The chances of finding a 'std-std' crankshaft in a used engine are roughly the
same as for finding lips on a chicken. So don't waste your time on the
overhaul kit from J. C. Whitney.    

Their ad states &quot;ALL parts needed for a professional rebuild...&quot;
Unfortunately,  JCW's definition of 'professional' is rather shoddy.  The kit
does not include a new oil pump.  It also does not include new cam-followers,
valve springs nor even the main oil seal.  In a truly professional overhaul,
those parts (and many others) are alwaysa replaced.  Here's why:

Having no oil filter, the oil pump in VW engines wears quite rapidly.
Standard practice with a truly professional overhaul is to replace both the
pump and the cover plate.

For proper operation, your cam-followers have a crowned surface (ie, slightly
convex). The crowned surface wears quite rapidly and replacement of the cam-
followers is standard practice in a proper overhaul (as is checking the cam
for wear).  (And don't consider using re-ground cam-followers unless you can
verify that the re-ground surface has been re-hardened after grinding.)

The strength of your valve-springs changes as they age, especially the springs
on the exhaust valves which run much hotter than the intakes.  For proper
operation of the engine it is vital that the valve springs have equal tension
which usually dictates they be replaced as part of your overhaul.

Worst of all perhaps is the fact the price J.C.Whitney charges for their
overhaul 'kit'.  In the catalog I have, they offer the kit for $214.99, plus
shipping.  But look at what the kit contains.

 A set of stock jugs $100 (all of these prices are taken from the same
catalog)
 A gasket set - $10
 A set of main bearings - $17
 A set of rod bearings - $7
 A set of cam bearings - $5
 A set of pushrod tubes $9
 Two sets of valve guides - $16
 4 exhaust valves - $28
 4 intake valves - $16

I come up with two-hundred and eight bucks for the parts in the kit... for
which JCW will happily charge you $215.  (The catalog is #58J, prices good
thru 31 October 1998).

In several of my articles I mentioned parts from J. C. Whitney that were a
bargain, such as their non-metallic silicone spark-plug leads (seven bucks in
this catalog).  But in another article (&quot;Cows&quot;) I made it clear that I thought
JCW's major advantage was their ubiquitous nature rather than the quality of
the things they sold.  I buy a lot of consumables from JCW because of the
convenience of mail-order  -- gasket sets, manifold boots and so forth, things
I know I'll need in the future and like to keep a stock on hand.  But as
illustrated by their overhaul kit, their ads can be misleading and their
pricing policy questionable.

--------------------------------------------------

Now for a reality check.

Your basic question implies you're planning to ovehaul your engine.  If that
is true then you're going about it ass-backwards.  As it now sits, your engine
represents a number of unknowns. You must start by tearing down your engine,
cleaning it, then determining what machine-work is required to return it to
spec.

Your basic question also implies that you're trying to get by on the cheap.
Life don't work that way, at least, not with engines.  At a minimum, your
crankcase will probably need to be align-bored, your rods rebuilt, your
crankshaft reground and your heads rebuilt.   What's that going to cost you?
How long will it take? 

Once those things are done you will have the information you need to order the
proper bearings.  But before you do anything at all you should understand that
a proper overhaul will probably cost about a thousand dollars for parts and
machine work and will take... as long as it takes.  You must then justify that
time/cost against the fact you can buy a brand-new, factory-built 1600cc
engine for about the same amount.  

With factory-built engines available, it's extremely difficult for the first-
time rebuilder to justify doing the task yourself.

------------------------------------

Three closing points worth mentioning:

Would I buy a factory-built engine?  Of course!  A brand-new factory-built
replacement engine is the best idea since canned beer!  It would cost me more
just to buy the unassembled parts.  But after buying one, the first thing I'd
do is take it all apart... I have a shop full of engine-building equipment,
all of the required tooling and forty-years worth of experience.  By paying
closer attention to the details of the engine's assembly -- and taking all the
time I need -- I know I can produce a better engine than anything Volkswagen
ever built.  That's the pay-off of experience.  But it's also a case of apples
vs. oranges.  Your question sez you're not an experienced engine-builder. What
works for me may not work for thee. 

Point Two is that there ain't no such thing as a free lunch.  A cheap overhaul
will leave you with an expensive, unreliable engine that will be lucky to do
12,000 miles before it craps out. 

Finally, a lot of people want to overhaul their engine just for the
experience.  If that's the case, consider doing this instead:  Put an ad in
the local paper saying you're a student who needs junked lawnmowers -- that
you'll haul them away for free.  In a week you'll be up to your eyebrows in
old lawnmowers.  Now start taking them apart.  You'll find the Haynes manual
for small engines to be a good guide.  

Once you figure out how they work, MAKE them work -- in a lot of cases all
they'll need is a carb-clean and a new spark plug, mebbe a new pull-cord.
Sharpen up the blade, haul them down to the swap-meet and each one of your
clean, running mowers is worth a twenty-five dollar bill.

Why lawnmowers?  First, because they're cheap (free is cheap, in case you
hadn't noticed :-), secondly because they're small -- you can hold a one-
lunger in your lap, you won't need a lot of shop space.  But most importantly
-- and read this twice -- because 'genetically' speaking, the 'DNA' of a one-
cylinder engine is about a 95% match for a Volkswagen engine (!).  The
knowledge you gain in learning to repair and tune a one-cylinder engine may be
transferred directly to the repair and maintenance of your Volkswagen.  And
you can even earn a little money in the process :-)
