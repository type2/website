Subject: single wheeled trailer

Someone posted an ad about a single wheel trailer from the nickel in the
Redding area a couple weeks ago. Does anyone still have the guys contact
number??
I was going to take a look at it but have no way of getting ahold of him
and it's no longer listed in the nickel as far as I can tell.

Thanks,
Greg
