Any one that went to Bob Baker happen to go into Encenits??  Did you see the
all original green '60 sunroof bug for sale?  Anybody buy it.  $2800  very
straight....sigh, and I need a commuter car.  Too many busses though...no
room left at the inn :-(

The show was small but great!  Perfect CA weather...sunny and 70.  No
swap...never is anyway.  A tad disappointed to see cal look notches and bugs
in a 'vintage' show.  They were tasteful at least.

&gt; Hey Aaron,  probly is the same bus.  It was in the auto trader,  It was
&gt; $750 the week before when I called him.  In encinitas right?  Ryan said
&gt; something about a flip seat in the front.  So it was a Sundial, I thought
&gt; so as per the extra vents in the loading area.  No hard feelings man,
&gt; maybe I could just see it sometime?  Are you in the sv2s club and did you
&gt; go to the bob baker show sun?   Good luck    Happy to have a 65
&gt; Sundial!!!   Jon in la mesa
