Subject: RE: [VB] Front engine compartment seal

Well, lets just say that my 67 SC has a 1600 DP w/doghouse and thermostatic
flaps, just as the maker designed for the engine, and it snuggled right up
against the seals just like it should. Now if I can get rid of the big hole
'71 rear tin and get a small hole heat riser rear tin to match my air
cleaner!

So the seal should ride on the top edge of the front tin?  Is there any
problem using this seal with dog house tin?

Thanks,

Thomas

Well, I have no idea how the book calls out for it to be installed. But from
working in this little airplane company here in Seattle I have found the
gaskets that things need to seal against are pointed towards the item that
will rest agaisnt it. I have always pointed all three seals down and when I
jack my engine into place the seal presses down against the sheet metal
forming a tight engine compartment seal. Never had exsaust leaks in my
engine compartment from the seals. Now, the pre heat tubes, that's another
subject.
