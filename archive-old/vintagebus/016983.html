Brake fade occurs when you overheat the pads/shoes to the point that the
material turns to gas, and creates a cushion of gas that gets in between
the drum and shoe or pad and rotor.  That's why they cut slots in the
rotors on the faster cars.  You will also heat up the brake fluid to the point
where it becomes compressible, giving you a soft pedal.

&gt; This is known as &quot;brake fade&quot;, and is a very real phenomenon.  Once your 
&gt; brake drums overheat and expand to the point that the shoes can't touch them, 
&gt; you're in real trouble!  I had this happen to me when I was driving my father
