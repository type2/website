Subject: 65 rv identify please.
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hoping someone could identify this beast for me. I've been sitting on this 
for a while and have decided to get rid of it. If you've seen these sell or 
just have an opinion, I would appreciate an Idea of how much to ask for this 
thing. last run in 94 when po's got too old to use it. also if you have any 
idea what company(s?) was doing this to buses that would be great to know 
too.
