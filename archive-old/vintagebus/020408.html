You need to ditch the &quot;quiet pack&quot; muffler - the 'quiet' only means
it's quieter than a dual exhaust.  Kiddies buy these things *because*
they're noisy!  Go back to a stock muffler.

Now, on to sound deadening.  Check out 
http://www_dot_calweb_dot_com/~thom/cgi-bin/gallery-search.cgi?string=sound+dampening

for the stuff I used on my panel.  It's probably the same stuff RMMW sells,
but oodles cheaper.  If you really want it quiet, put it above the engine and
all over the engine compartment all the way to the front of the gas tank,
and on the roof as well.

You didn't mention what model bus you have; if youhave a deluxe or standard, 
put your headliner back in.  If you have a kombi or  panel, you're kinda
screwed.  Ifyou have a single cab - what's your daughter doing in the back in the
first place?

&gt; Anyone have any luck quieting their bus?  I added a quiet pack muffler and 
&gt; it's still loud.  I was looking at this noise reduction paneling stuff in 
&gt; the Rocky Mtn catalog, does that help.  I would like to be able to hear the 
&gt; radio w/o turning it all the way up or hear my daughter talk from the back 
&gt; of the bus.
