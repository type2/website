Ok I was searching the net on this subject and went to Valvolines web site 
(personal Oil choice is Valvoline) and searched through their gear oil and 
found one just for VW's or one of the few applications. It's Valvonline 
Hydro-Lube Gear Lube SAE 80W-90 5 Gallon Por-Pail 538. I was at the former 
Grand Auto now Kragen and he was pretty sure they could order it. It looks 
like a current product that is available but only in the 5 Gallon size.
