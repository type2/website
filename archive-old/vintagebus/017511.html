Hi.

My 67 deluxe has really nasty rust in the top of the
door thresholds. That &quot;L&quot; or &quot;G&quot; - shaped lip that the
weather strip mounts into on the body of the bus, at
the top of the door opening. They're pretty-much gone.

Would it be worth welding in a cut section from
another bus (yours?) OR do you think it would be
bettter for a good body/fab. person to weld in a
channel made out of new metal.

&gt; cut em off.
&gt; if you have needs let me know i will be takin the
&gt; stuff to sac on the 3rd, 
&gt; but if i cant make it for some reason i can ship
&gt; most parts. i am selling 
&gt; stuff cheap just so i can pay for the tools i got to
&gt; take the metal.
&gt; cool
