&gt; Does anyone else not use the hammer sockets that take a 1/2&quot; break over?  I

&gt; sledge.  I have yet to have one whip me since I bought these.  Only about 7
&gt; bucks!  I hope I'm talking about the same thing everybody else is(axle nuts)
&gt; because I thought everybody used these.  Peace!

I have one and I've used it on a bug, but I didn't have a good feeling
about it.  Wanging around on a nut that is closely associated with
bearings with a big hammer just doesn't seem like a good idea.  I've no
evidence that this is damaging, but I don't want to hit things with a
hammer if I can avoid it.  I went the socket-and-slide bar route (though
from Sears, not Snap-on) and have been very happy with the results.  The
other nice thing about going the socket route is that it is easy to torque
the nut back on.
