You  can attempt to do three things that may isolate where the problem is.
At the starter motor are to points that can be jumpered from the large +
lead that comes from the battery and attatches to the starter motor.
&gt;From the hot lead you jump to the (usually) spade connection on the
solenoid.  It should produce a resounding thunk, click etc.  If not, that
component is suspect.
The large hot lead can be jumpered to the starter motor and the motor
should whirrr...if not suspect that.
If you turn on the headlights and then they go completely out when the
ignition key is turned to start...loose terminals or corrosion.  But, if
the lights are bright when key is turned, jumper terminals 30 and 50...if
the starter operates then most likely an open cirquit.
Lots of reason for a starter motor not to spin, and a couple of reasons a
solenoid won't work.  Most of those problems can be repaired by the do it
yourselfer...altho it seems more and more folks just replace the whole
thing for new if part/all of it goes bad.
Good luck.
later
