I figure I have 15 VW's, plus some assorted american iron  (I consider these
the eye sores) laying around.  I also have a very tall fence.  One thing in my
favor is that 3 of my neighbors are VW owners.  If fact I sold VW's to two of
them.  As for here in Oregon I do not believe their is a law restricting the
number of cars one person my own.  I also live in the city limits, but am
lucky enough to be in an area zone as agricultural.  Figure if any one gives
me trouble, I'll tell them its a Volkswagen farm.
   Peace, Love, and if the farm gig don't fly I try the ART THING!!!
