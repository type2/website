I think split and bay are different.  I have one just like the one Thom has on
his '60.  It is on my 62 truck.  Thom's was made in the early 60's I think while
mine has a build date of '71.  So, I think that the bars that fit the earlier
(post round tube tranny support) were made up into the 70's.  Still, with the
change in transmissions, rear motor hanger, bumper, et. al. I think bay window
tow bars would be different.  That said, I've never seen a bay Westfalia tow
bar.

&gt; &gt; Can a trailer hitch that is currently on a 65 be put on a 71?  The PO said
&gt; &gt; it is a Westy hitch, and it has a funky little gear mechanism(frozen) right
&gt; &gt; behind the ball.  I'm currently locked out of the 65 (Marital issue) but if
&gt; &gt; I pulled up in front of the house in my 71 with a little h*nda atv on a
&gt; &gt; trailer for her birthday, all would be forgivin' and the 65 would then get
&gt; &gt; the new brakes which are currently in hiding;)
