&gt; Just saw on tv (and we all know how reliable THAT is),
&gt; that Flagstaff has just set a new record with 18
&gt; straight days of measureable precipitation.
&gt; Does this mean Jerome will be a mudbath/swamp this
&gt; year? 
&gt; Anyone in the area with an accurate update? 
&gt; Wanna know if we should pack the waders.
&gt; 

Normal proceedure for Jerome is to pack for the heat, AND pack for the 
cold/rain.  It has been both, in the same event, but is usually somewhere in 
between.  What it is today has little to do with what it will be tomorrow.

Hope any of that made some sence,
