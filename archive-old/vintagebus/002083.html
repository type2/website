Subject: Oil cooler

My question is this: were there &quot;heavy duty&quot; oil coolers available? I just
got an oil cooler that I bought on eBarf and it fits perfect on the mount
and the holes line up perfect but two of the bolts are simply too short!!!
Original cooler as I remember was a bit thinner. This baby is like 3.25&quot;
thick, 3.25&quot; wide and about 10&quot; long. Does that sound right?

Help me here solve this puzzle.

Andre
