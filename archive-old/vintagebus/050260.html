Subject: stretching aftermarket safari seals?

I've got a set of aftermarket safarti window seals. They came with a
complete used set-up I bought a while back. They are the seal for the frame
to bus window opening. They are too small for the window opening. They are
one piece and made from a rubber type of material.

I was wondering if anyone has ever heated seals like this up either with
water or hot air and successfully stretched them to fit, or even get close
to fit?
