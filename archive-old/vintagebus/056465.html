Subject: Re: [VB] Run the thermostat or not?

&gt; I have never seen an unslotted bracket, did they make fixed hole brackets
ever? I am looking at 7 of them right now from various years and they all
have slotted block mount holes.
&gt;
Yes, the bracket on my '67 Squareback is solid, I just had it off yesterday.
That actually surprised me, I expected it to be slotted as indicated in my
shop manual.

My NOS 36hp/40hp brackets are all solid.
