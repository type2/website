&lt;&lt; How much oil into each box to get it up to the axle housing? Then you fill
 the trans to its proper level, drive it,  then check it after they have had

Hi Sonney,
Till they are full and then replace the fill plugs in each reductions and 
fill the center section.  All together it should almost take a full gallon of 
85/90 Wt Sta-Lube GL-4 gear oil.   Eric&amp;Barb
