Subject: RE: [VB] Insulation/sound deadening

Most of my engine noise comes from the air vents and at this time of the
year I don't want to stuff anything down my vents !

   Everyone is looking up the wrong alley for sound deadener. Go to any high
end auto sound site and look for deadener material. They have stuff that
will block the sound of a firecracker (or louder). When I'm at one of the
many trade shows I attend I am always amazed at the stuff these stereo guys
come up with. I know Dyno Mat used to be one of them, but there are products
now that far surpass Dyno Mat.

Goto
www.mcmaster_dot_com
Then do a search for &quot;Adhesive-Back Damping Sheet&quot;

The mastic ones are what I believe to be the ones that people call 'tar'
mats.

&gt; &gt;Anyone have suggestions on &quot;insulation&quot; for sound deadening?  Is it worth
&gt; doing?  This was on a singlecab at Jerome last year.they claim that the
&gt; singlecab is so quiet that they cannot hear the engine running.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Not for nothing but every *stock* Single and Double Cab I have ridden in,
&gt; you could not hear the engine at idle and barely hear it at highway
speeds.
&gt;  Wind noise drowned it out.
&gt;
&gt; You can barely hear the engine running at idle in my my '55 Kombi (stock
&gt; 36hp) but at highway speeds, it's ear plug time.
&gt;
&gt; I installed some McMaster-Carr sheets behind my rear seat, it did not
appear
&gt; to do much, if anything.  I was considering slapping on another layer.
&gt; Or maybe I just need one of them fancy Buses with a headliner and cargo
&gt; area panels.  ;)
