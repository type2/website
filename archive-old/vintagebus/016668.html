Something bothers me about this whole conversational
thread. Are we talking VWs as commodity trading or
cool old vehicles that we actually enjoy drive and
enjoy? Sure, I'm selling my barn but enjoy driving it.
Several times during the Classic Weekend I looked
around the bus and thought that I might take it off of
the market because I think that its cool as hell, a
solid driver and pleases me. The wife agreed that we
could take it off of the market if we want to continue
living in an unpainted house in disrepair and cut back
on paying the pediatrician's bills and lower any
anticipation of potential longterm intimacy.
Whoop!, barney remains but might be pulled if I sell
another vehicle or two.
The '54 is not &quot;original&quot; as far as being a 100%
complete Ambulance nor is a &quot;correct and original&quot;
Westfalia. I bought it because it is bitchen the way
it is. F all of this anal to a fault chit. The 54 is
&quot;original&quot; in drivetrain, safaris, bumpers, cab
divider and a hundred other aspects. I am glad that it
isn't an ambo. A correct ambo to me is like a
quadriplegic nymphomaniac. The concept might be
intriguing for a split second and then is not
appealing at all. =) On the otherhand a cool looking,
mechanically solid~ solid driving, usable, old school
and unique badazzed camperized bus is *very*
desirable. My personality is strong enough to make my
own choices based on something other than what the
trend of the week is.

The bus is in fact being offered for sale at a super
cheap price for what it is. Anyone who buys it because
they like it, intend to use it, properly maintain and
improve it will be pleased with the purchase.

If you are a foreign broker or a pimp for one looking
to fill a specific &quot;order&quot; for a customer then you
probably wont be interested because your customer wont
have knowledge of (or deserve to have) a unique
bitchen bus. You will probably be shopping for just
another cookie cutter template. If you are a foreign
broker or a pimp for one and want to buy a dead solid
EZ Camper then I can hook you right up. Potential
trade for GMC Suburban 2500 on either vehicle. The
enthusiasm for VWs is dissipating by the day.
Write for photos.
