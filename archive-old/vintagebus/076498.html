Want my suggestion? Dump the wife, keep the VW's. It's cheaper.

I hear ya James.  I was actually drooling the other day when my Dad 
mentioned he wants to sell his cherry '93 Expl*rer -- cruise, AC, auto, 
*towing capability* ...  And the wife has me on a two-cars-in-the-driveway 
limit, which I'm about to reach when the '65 beetle vert rolls out of the 
shop and joins the '65 neunsitzer.  Gee, which child to sell?
