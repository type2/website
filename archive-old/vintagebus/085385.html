 White with tan uph and the factory yellowish combo. Generally all there,
most parts and panels. Uph in pretty good shape.

Has sink, water tank, the usual closets and nooks and crannys. Has no
engine, brakes will need some fluid and bleeding. Batty  dead. Had been
sitting in the weather for 10 years before I found it. 

Looks like can come back to life without too much hassle..OR use for it's
many parts.It

is not a rust bucket and all the documentation I have in from Arizona. 

Thanks for your help and hope we can find it a good home in your club. I am
only 150 miles from Phoenix, so not too far away.

Please let me know and many thanks.
