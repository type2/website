Its not a barn door.  I have to crawl under there this weekend and check it
all out.  I guess I should invest in a manual.

Hey Paul,
&gt; &amp; a 99 New Beetle already.
I don't know if you should have mentioned this.:)

Sounds like a really nice single cab.

&gt; it is one of the smoothest running VWs I have owned.  I had problems
getting
&gt; it into reverse at first and the seller told me that it needed a shift
&gt; bushing &quot;same as in my beetle but easier to get at&quot;.  Now I lost 4th gear.
&gt; :-(  So I am going to change the bushing and hope it is not the trans.
It depends.  I converted my 58 panel to the bushing type.  It originally
had a kind of spring pushing down on the rod to sort of guide it.  No real
bushing.  Do go under and check it all out.  check your trans
mounts.  Can't hurt.  Do you have a splitcase or tunnel trans?

&gt; Also, how rare is a 55 pickup and what is the range of prices, before and
&gt; after restoration?  Even in its current state it still turns heads here in
&gt; Chicago.

Can't help you much, but is it a barndoor type? (no overhang of the roof
over the front windows?  I don't know much about single cabs, but a 55 is
a good thing!  I know buses that partway through the year they changed
over from the barndoor in 55 and barndoors are usually more valuable, but
any 55 is a find.  Have fun.
