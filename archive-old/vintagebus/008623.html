Greetings and Felicitations, all ye Transported Ones,

Some time ago, during a busy/hectic period, I saw, but lost the message from
a rubber/seal supplier who is on the list.  This person mentioned a listee
discount, and also a possible quantity discount.  As I am facing the
replacement of almost every piece of rubber/felt, etc on two Kombis, I am
thinking that it would be good to order everything I need at once.  Our '66
Westy, Clara Nugget, is going to get the house paint stripped off this
weekend, and I'll need to remove the windows....what a great time to replace
seals, eh?  The other bus, a '67 named Mathilde, will not be needing
anything soon, as she is still in many pieces, but to have the stuff ready
is good, methinks.

Who was this masked supplier, and what do you think?  At one point, I
calculated a list of needs, and it came out to around $800....

Gene
