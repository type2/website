Hi all, 

I just got my '64 Sundial back from the mechanic, who installed my rebuilt
transmission

A couple of observations / questions:

1. 	I'm getting a short grinding sound upon acceleration after shifting from
2nd 	to 3rd, and to a lesser degree, 3rd to 4th, just after the shift though,
then it's 	gone.  The mechanic will have another look, but I'd like some ideas
if you have 	any.  Clutch was replaced during trans replacement.


2.  The gear ratio on this rebuild seems WAY lower (especially 4th)
	then the previous trans, which I assumed to be original.  I'm told that the
	rebuild is from a '67 Bus but had a taller 4th gear installed, but it seems
the 	opposite is true (this thing SCREAMS at 50mph)  My question is: Could a
	mistake in the clutch / redux. boxes etc. replacement / assembly process
	cause this, provided the gear ratios are as claimed?  I spoke with the
	rebuilder and he was puzzled but offered to exchange the trans for another
	and eat the $200 in shipping.  So now that the $550 I paid the mechanic is
	blown. I suppose it's time for me to take the big plunge and consider doing
the 	next replacement myself?  Get a better paying job? I need a drink...

	Trying to be optimistic,

	Jeff
