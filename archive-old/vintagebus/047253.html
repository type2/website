Anyone else feel that we should give this topic a break for awhile?  Maybe 
get back to the REAL busses at hand.  And how about the fact that Havasu, 
only the coolest damn bus campout thats out there is coming in a week!   =)

We should be talking about prepping the busses, John Howard's apron, Kyles 
tequila, what we plan on bringing to trade/sell, how the heck to bug Thom for 
not going (if he doesnt), etc...
