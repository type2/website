Make sure you get the correct bellypans.
There are 51?-58 and 59-67 ones!
Only repops I've seen are the late style.

&lt;&lt;The belly pans are welded on.  The only way to get to the insides would be 
to 
remove (cut) them, treat, then re-weld.  Perhaps a better solution in the

would be to check all the little drain holes and make sure they're not 
plugged.

Maybe you could put plugs in all the drain holes, and fill the cavity with a 
thinned
POR-15 solution.  Of course it would take a few gallons of this stuff, and 
POR-15 is
~$35/quart...

&gt; I have a bunch of POR15 that I plan to use to keep my bus from ever rusting 
&gt; away. I've heard that the belly pans are good for water to sit a possibly 
&gt; start rusting. I would like to coat both sides of the pans, frame rails, 
&gt; outriggers, etc... I don't want to have to pay Kelly (Metwiz) to fix all 
this 
&gt; stuff in the future.
