So sorry folks, but the bench rules!

I don't have to toss my spare on the roof rack that I don't need to
carry all the time.  It doesn't cover up the way nifty NON CHROME VW
emblem up front.  I can stash coveralls, my spare dizzy (thanks Andy!),
survival rations and a space blanket (never hooked up the heat) under
the seat.

The dog doesn't try and sit on my lap giving me kisses in the middle of
Miami rush hour (closest thing to a foreign country while in the
continental USA).  When traveling I can pile the coolers and necessities
against it, and put the old SONY speakers on top to drown out the kids
fighting.  If I have to stop hard (yeah right) I don't end up with all
that stuff up front with me.

Ghidorah the Iguana has decided that the bench back is her seat and is
quite happy watching the world go by with the whistle of unsealed doors
in her tympanic membranes.  The bird can rest safely behind the divider
secure in knowing I can't thwack it when it squawks.

If there's something in the back I need, why I just pull over, get a
stretch, and go get it without trying to become an accident statistic
when the missus puts her well shaped butt in my face to fetch,
distracting me from the important task of ensuring the tinkertoy is
going where it (I mean I) wants to go.

And those are just what immediately comes to mind.  I'm sure I could
come up with more.  (is this friday?)
