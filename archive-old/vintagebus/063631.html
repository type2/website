&gt; Thanks for the reply.  I'm not sure if I should include the whole list on 
&gt; this or not.  Anyway... people may want to know.

Hi Duff,
No problem, we will just send this to the list!

&gt; &gt;&gt;both of the bushings pressed in far enough&lt;&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; I have made sure that both bushings are to the specification of the Bentley
&gt; manual.  I have also been told that I can hammer the wavey washer so it's
&gt; not so wavey.  That may help but I'm not sure if that's a good idea or not?
&gt; I've got about an 1/8th of an inch before the bolt will line up with the
&gt; notch.  Too much?

Sounds like a badly machined center pin!  Take out the warpy washer and see 
how far off the bolt notch is off.  Measure just the thickness of the warpy 
washer not its warp.  Add this washer thickness to the first measurement.  If 
this equals out then flatten the washer some, if still too short you need a 
new center pin.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;mismachined center pin&lt;&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; The center pin is brand new.

Even NOS can be bad!

&gt; 
&gt; Thanks again!
&gt; Duff
&gt; 

No problem!
Eric&amp;Barb
