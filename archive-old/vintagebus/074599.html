Subject: Re: LED taillights

ive used them... they are nice as they can be seen in DIRECT sunlight, where 
the 1156 bulbs are almost useless in bright sun. but, i didnt like the fact 
that they made the lights blink so fast, like when a bulb is burnt out. i 
could never be sure that all the lights were flashing... and i didnt feel 
like MacGyver-ing some relay to slow them down to normal speed :-)
