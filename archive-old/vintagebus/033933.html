Subject: the sinlge cab box
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

It took 3 days to build. Cutting and all kinda stuff. It was harded then i 
had tought it would be. Fits good now behind the seat, doesnt hurt any thing. 
It sounds really good, and doesnt look bad either. Now all i have to do is 
carpet it or somthing. 
Does any one know who the guy is that bought my old 67 single cab? Yellow and 
white convertable.

Steve M AZ-4-BANGERZ  v.p.
58 single cab
