&lt;&lt; There did not seem to be much interest in this back in 1998, but I told 
 Richard that I would see if any interest has picked up.  The price seems 
okay 
 for me, and I would be willing to spend even a little more for repop trim.  
 It's just finding the demand that is a problem.  So is there any interest 
out 
 there? Reply to me (solohobbit_at_aol_dot_com) or the list and I will tally up the 
 results and post them.  FYI, Richard's address is Oldred62_at_aol_dot_com.

Robert Summers in Florida (941-699-2287) has been producing these for years. 
He's quite an interesting character. Has an old orange packing plant full of 
VW's and parts. His collection includes an ambulance, high boy, and many 
bugs. The last time I was there, he had probably 50 engine cases and 
transmissions laying around, roof clips, fenders, AC units, everything. The 
coolest thing is his aquarium which was is about the first 2 feet of a split 
nose clip with the fish swimming behind the windshields!
