 Glynn - burning his hard copy 
 
 &gt; The Obsolete Air-Cooled Documentation Project is proud to announce the
 &gt; newest addition to our on-line library: the 1954 Type II parts manual!
 &gt; Over 500 pages of every single piece that goes into a Barndoor, with
 &gt; text in English, German, and French!  Also, all illustrations that were
 &gt; originally in color are presented in color.
 &gt; 
  &gt;&gt;
funny about that,  I was listening to NPR yesterday and there was a guy 
bemoaning the Library of Congress'  and others rush to store things 
exclusively in microfilm/ computers, and not keep books, and finding the 
paper has kept better. Moral is, keep the hard copy.     Then again, most of 
use can't find a copy of this, hooray for making it available!!!!


**Now what was that URL again?
