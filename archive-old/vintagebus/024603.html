Subject: Rare Westy Tumblers FOR SALE!!! READ!!

Hi guys..

Anyone out there with a early westfailia will know what these are!!! 
This is the rarest of the rare as far as VW Westfalia parts...or any bus
parts for that matter goes!!

These are the 6 small aluminum tumblers glasses found in the `59-`61
Westys.  I have been lucky enough to buy the remaining New Old Stock
from the Original Equipment manufacturer.  These were found sitting in a
warehouse in Germany.

The large cups were completely gone and not available...but similar
larger size cups seem to be quite easily found at antique stores and
flea markets.  The smaller size have been all but impossible to
find...until now!

-Each set of 6 is still factory sealed in its original papers.
-Each set contains 6 different and factory correct colors.
-These are NOS and from the OEM manufacturer.
-100% Satisfaction Guaranteed!!! Money back if not pleased with them.
-VERY Limited stock is available...when they are gone, they are gone!!!

For more information and pictures I have added a page dedicated to these
on my web page.  Check them all linked on my site..at

Thanks Todd S
