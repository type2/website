Subject: Stiff Shifting on a 66 split
Date: Mon, 9 Nov 1998 23:28:16 -0500

Importance: Normal

I have been driving my 66 bus for about 6 weeks now and I have noticed that
my shifting has become much more stiff than it was.  I do not pop out of
gear at all and have not heard any wining or groaning from the tranny.  I do
not seem to have any problems finding gears either.  I do, however feel that
it is becoming increasing stiff and am concerned that this trend might
continue.  I also hear a rubbing or crunching type noise just behing the
bulk head when I move the shifter around into all four gears.  Kind of
sounds like rust.  Any help is appreciated.

Thanks,

Todd H.
