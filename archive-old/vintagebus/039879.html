How fast in a bus? ... a contradiction in terms.

A friend of mine did this in a 23-Window that the family had picked up in 
Europe and driven down through Jordan and Syria to some archaeological digs 
they were working.  Headed towards Palm Springs (CA) when a wind gust 
suddenly came up and broadsided him without warning.  The Bus shimied, spun 
sideways and laid down since it couldn't cope with the break dancing stuff 
very well... it finally just slid down the road on its side for awhile.  
Needless to say, a beautiful Bus destroyed. Jon (Hazetguy) is right... nuts 
to do this kinda thing, defeats the purpose of owning a bus I'd say unless 
you are trying to cash out an insurance policy.  I still miss that Bus.
