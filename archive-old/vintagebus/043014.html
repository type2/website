Not sure why this didn't seem to post, but I'll take the liberty of
re-posting it to the list -


The following is my own opinion gleaned from participating in the
restoration of my own beloved 67 deluxe:

Find someone else!  Your assumption regarding pickiness is correct. I
spent hundreds of hours around the shop working on my car, and seeing all
the othre customers come and go for a year and a half. I was picky and
anal, and the shop owner thought this was *really* neat. His other
customers ranged from casually picky to far more than myself, and I was
being *real* picky about certain details.  The work got done as I wished
in most cases, and my pickiness and detail-anality paid off well. 

You will feel a whole lot better about the work, in progress, as well as
when it is finished, if you find someone who encourages your pickiness.
The first shop that my bus went to (long story) initially tolerated my
detailness, then turned on me, and made it so I had to remove the car from
his shop, totally stripped down, and search for what turned out to be a
far better situation. 

Find the right situation *before* you have to tow your bus home as a
taken-apart shell!
