hey...
i just did this sunday. let me first say i HATE dealing with the engine 
compartment seals... the ones you slide in with the apron SUCK too! i 
sprayed the channels with this white lithium grease i have in an aerosal can 
and they literally slid right in in like a minute! it was the coolest thing 
ever. a friend was helping me and i was telling him what a b#tch these seals 
are... and next thing i know the're all done. get some compressed air and 
blow oout the channels and give it a shot.

later,
