Subject: Re: [VB] gen brushes...was  Electric vs Mechanicle?

Re: worn out brushes causing arcing that damages the comutator which makes the gen eat brushes up in a vicious cycle.
 
... I don't know... the bus I had .... after I changed the brushes, it charged fine and didn't eat brushes at all.   It was a daily driver actually, too.
Since then, I have always checked the brushes on new to me engines, and if I have the engine out and the brushes look marginal I'll changed them while the engine is out (easier).  I also carry brushes in my spare parts box in the bus on road trips.   That was the only time I have driven much at all with worn gen brushes...  and in that case there were no lasting effects.  
 
????????????  whatever.
