Well, it appears that this will be a bigger project than we expected to take
on, so plans have changed. Now we are gonna just cut the roof section off of
his and weld it to my 65 which has a great frame aside from the very end of
one outrigger. Any points to ponder on this note? Also, Is there any special
reinforcement on the ragtop bus to make up for lack of structural strength
in the roof? We are still gonna have to replace rockers and dog legs, and
also rear corners. Still gonna be a huge project but he is determined. I
would personally try to find one in better shape, but I really hate
bodywork! Gonna have to get used to it though I guess. Can't alway find
deals like my 67 westy(Thansk again Dave!) that need virtually no bodywork
and just the mechanicals reworked. Thanks for the replies everyone!
P.S.-He doesn't care about originality or resale value on this bus, he is
trying to build a safe daily driver for him and never plans on selling it.
Just thoguht I'd point that out before I got an inbox full of &quot;you can't do
that!&quot;'s Thanks again!

&gt; It's not right.  And then some.  Basically, I screwed it up
&gt; seven ways to Sunday when I put it in the first time.  The main
&gt; rails are shifted 3/4&quot; to the driver's side, and the passenger side is
&gt; higher than the driver's side.  This was complicating matters when I
&gt; was doing the driver's side Big Panel replacement, the doglegs, etc.
&gt; And the belly pans wouldn't have been able to go on correctly either.
&gt;
&gt; Last Friday I got a massive shipment from Alan Schofield - new
&gt; frame center pieces, I-beams, outriggers, corners, battery trays, etc.
&gt; This metal cost more than a lot of people have paid for their cars!
