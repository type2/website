Subject: Tire Sizes (again, sorry in advance)

I've checked the archive and technical articles but drew a blank.

Someone fairly recently posted recommended tire sizes fro splitties but
I lost the reference.

I'm running stock 14&quot; rims and currently have 185/75R14 Pirelli which
aren't bad on road
but absolutely SUCK on snow or sand.

If memory serves, a light truck tire will have the load ratings I
require, but I can't find any
in the 185/75R14 size.  205/75R14 are no problem to find.  Will these
safely fit on my rims?

Things I'm looking for in the tire include:
-good load rating
-stiff side walls
-aggressive tread for decent snow and dirt traction
-fit on my stock rims

If anyone has info or specific tire recommendations, please let me know.

Thanks,
...Markus (and Tardis)

ps:  humble apologies for yet-another-tire-posting
