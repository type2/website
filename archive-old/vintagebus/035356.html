 &quot;Give SUVs a break.
 I find the furor that many anti-SUV Kuddites

perhaps he meant Luddites?
-----------------
bring up to the most amusing,
 as are the many &quot;facts&quot; that they pull out of the air to prove how
 deleterious a sport utility vehicle will be on Earth. Well, excuse me for
 living.
 I used to drive an early 1970's Volkswagen van, not unlike some of the aging
 relics seen even now around the Willamette Valley. I've enjoyed the economy
 of movement, not to mention the acceleration, these vehicles employ.
 My point? The SUV I own now has comparable, if not better, gas mileage than
 the old clunker had. Even when I gave my VW van the best tune up I could
 give it, drove with a tail wind and kept it unloaded, its mileage was not
 better than my much reviled current vehicle.
 Only now, I have the option of having my feet warm and keeping the
 windshield defrosted on a cold day. I can accelerate much better now, thank
 you very much.
 So, for all those blowhards who are constantly whining about the evils of
 SUVs, get a life! Get rid of your clunky Volkswagens. Put forth an example.&quot;

sounds like the writer just wanted a new car.  Didn't want to fix his bus up, 
beyond a tune up.  My old 65 bus defogs like all get out, in on defog it 
blows so hard it annoys  I kick it to foot heat in a mile, once the 
windsheilds cleared. and warms up fine.     But I also did work to keep the 
heat in- rust repair, insulation, nice new paneling, replaced seals around 
the doors.   Of course, a new car comes with all these things nice and new.  
I don't blame anyone for wanting comfort.  With 30 years newer technology, I 
would hope they would have made a better heater, and some other improvements. 
  It's okay, don't feel bad.

But wonder why the writer now resents VW drivers. For a 30 + year old car 
getting  roughly the same MPG as your new SUV is hardly something you can 
point a finger at.  Also, the production process eats up a huge amount of 
resources engery and creates pollution, so the old VW is creating less than 
yours, all things factored in.  What evils of SUVs do people &quot;whine&quot; about?   
Drivers not paying attention while they talk on their cell phone.   That's 
not whining.   Bad driving in dangerous, no matter what you drive.

I liked the point that using a cell phone and driving cause more accidents 
than drinking and driving.     Should make people think.
