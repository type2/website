Subject: [VB] bus sighting in Nov 2005 issue of Car &amp; Driver

Secod to last page of November 2005 &quot;Car &amp; Driver&quot; magazine features the 
back of a well known bus ( well at least one I have seen ).  The caption 
is very flattering... Hint the bus is a small hatch with 67' style 
reverse lights and &quot;40hp at work please pass&quot; on the back
