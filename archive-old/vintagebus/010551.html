&lt;&lt; If we were to have a roof rack that had some buckled legs, is it possible 
to 
 straighten these?  People have over riders straightened right?  seems like 
it 
 should be possible to have the bars of a rack straightened as well.
 
 What kind of place would we go to for this type of work?  Can anyone 
 recommend a place in so cal?
 
 Thanks

I second that except this rack i have is a 66-67 poptop westy rack.  I have 
to replace the cracked wood but wonder if someone can straighten the legs.  
They arent buckeled, just a little tweaked.  Maybe cheaper than replacing the 
legs?
