Some VW shops and FLAPS up here have confirmed a suspicion I've had for
several years about genuine BOSCH starters and generators.

They're sold as &quot;New&quot;, but are in fact totally rebuilt by BOSCH from used
units.  They are still higher quality than the cut-rate &quot;rebuilds&quot; from
generic FLAPS, but they are not factory new parts.

In years past I've written about bad experiences with genuine BOSCH
replacement starters, either &quot;New&quot; or openly identified as BOSCH rebuilds.

On the other hand, the BOSCH generator on our Westy is the original
factory-installed part, as verified by documentation.  When we bought the
Westy it had ~125,000 miles on it.  At 206,000 miles we had the engine
rebuilt, and while it was accessible I took the generator to a local custom
rebuilder that I've used for 20+ years.

I asked them to disassemble and rebuild the generator even though it was
working just fine.  They found no measurable wear on anything except the
brushes and commutator.  After going over all the components with the shop's
owner, I settled on a commutator tidying up and a new set of brushes.  There
are now ~19,000 miles on the &quot;custom rebuild&quot; and the generator still
operates perfectly.

The regulator on our bus is the factory-installed unit, and it also
functions perfectly after ~225,000 miles.

Some more of that dumb luck I mentioned previously, I guess.....
