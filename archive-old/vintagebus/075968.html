&gt; that.

Hi Jason,
Do you have the section and page/s that is on??  As far as we have ever heard 
all makes of gas heater that exited the engine compartment we on the left 
side of the engine.  So all 25, 36, &amp; 40 HP bus air cleaners (Except for the 
40 HP oversized bus air cleaner that was right side located to begin with.) 
had to be reslung over to the right side with a special bracket that bolted 
to the generator area.
