Subject: Re: [VB] Re: door panels

I know when I print those wiring diagrams I print them out over a few 
sheets of paper on a regular inkjet printer. Then I tape them together and 
&quot;laminate&quot; them with 3M clear packing tape. I don't know if some method 
like this for printing the templates for interior panels for personal use 
would work or not. It sure wouldn't use much ink, but you'd have to be REAL 
sure everything was to proper scale and lined up appropriatly.

Maybe some kind of permanant marks on the individual pages to make sure 
they are lined up correctly.

Of course we could leave the execution of getting them back into the &quot;real 
world&quot; to the individual and maybe worry about getting the patterns into 
the computer world first I guess. But it would sure be nice to have an easy 
way for people to get access to interior panel templates.
