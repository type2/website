Subject: Cruise control in a splittie! (long)

Well gang,  I'm almost done fitting a cruise control unit to my 64 =
delux!
I had always thought about doing it, and looked at the kits that are =
offered at the autoparts stores, but never took the step of trying it =
until I read Donald Gibbons page listed at type2_dot_com.    Seeing that he =
had sucessfully installed it into a 75 Bay window with FI (not sure if =
he has the 1.7, 1.8, or 2.0), I figured, I've been doing enough out of =
state driving, that I could benefit from something like this.

The module itself has over a half dozen little switches that are used to =
'program' the unit to fit a specific vehicle, and that has taken a lot =
of trial and error to get it to work right on my litte 1600DP.   Also, =
figuring how to get the module hooked up to pull the accelerator cable =
and all that took a while with some trail and error action going on =
there too.  But a test drive this morning, has shown me that i've =
finally got it working, and boy is it sweet!  It's actually freaky =
having it kick in the first time, like the bus has a mind of it's own, =
and powers forward!  Weird.

Anyway, the only glitch I've run into now, is the spring on the carb is =
too stiff.  The cruise module can only pull so much (I think it used =
manifold vacuum), so if I hit an uphill grade, the unit will kick off, =
as soon as it can't pull the throttle anymore.  I pulled the cable by =
hand, and it is suprisingly tough.  I have an idea for it, and i'll get =
to work on that later this morning to see if it works.  Trick is, I have =
to find a spring setup, that is soft enough that allows the unit to pull =
me to full throttle, but stiff enough to pull the throttle back closed =
for idle.  The gears in the head are spinnin........

Anyway, the unit is the $100 item from PepBoys, made by Audiovox, model =
CCS-100.  It's pretty neat, and easy to use.  and it has three different =
way to turn itself off!  the two obvious ones are, to hit the off button =
on the dash, and to press the brake, but it also will turn itself off if =
you press the clutch in (senses the rpms going up) and I tested it this =
morning, and it works great.

so anyway, after I get this throttle return spring figured out, i'll put =
up a page on my website showing where and how I mounted everything, what =
mods I had to make, and what settings I have the module set on for =
anyone that wants to install something like this in thier bus.  The =
instuctions that come with it are good for hooking up the electircal =
jank, but I think a lot of time and frustration could be saved for =
anyone that installs it on thier bus, seeing how someone has already =
done it.  A LOT of trial and error to get this stuff working.  So far, =
I've only had to drill one small hole in the carbs throttle arm, and =
that's all.  Even for the dash module, no drilling!
