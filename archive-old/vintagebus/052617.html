Dave,

Torsion bars can break/snap.  Had this happen to me in a type 3 once.  Bar 
broke, and front end just squatted with wheels having way too much camber 
steering virtually gone.  Nasty moment.

The leafs can also become stressed and break, but since there are a number of 
them it doesn't have the same instant effect as a torsion bar.  When we raced 
Formula Vees we use to have a leaf spring set up where we broke every other 
leaf and then reinstalled.  We use this set up for racing in the rain where a 
&quot;soft&quot; suspension was beneficial.  It worked great, but was borderline 
illegal.  

Have you checked your shocks and all other movable parts etc?

Good luck with it
