Subject: RE: [VB] 59 Westy in Houston

I've talked with a few people about the bus but never the actual owner...
supposedly it's been on ebay a few times and the reserve keeps going down.
I'd bid but shipping up to Oregon would out weigh any good deal that you
might be able to get on it... (anybody willing to drive it to Oregon for a
few 6-packs? ;-)

Is anyone familiar with the 59 Westy FS in Houston? It
was original SWR/BG but is all painted up hippy style
now?  Has anyone looked at this bus?  It looks to have
it's interior there.  Rusty rockers.

thanks for the help
Matthew
