&gt;   Since the move from BD to non-BD was so huge a change VW was probably
&gt; beginning to do the planning, producing press dies and testing of the new
&gt; prototype VW bus by 53 or early 54.

They wouldn't have had to go to all of that trouble. The new engine
compartment design came from the ambulances and singlecabs. They probably
had plenty around to shoot pictures of. Maybe even Ellis' '54 Barnambulator,
for instance.
