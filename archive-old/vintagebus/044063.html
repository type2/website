Hey John,

Have you spammed us?  Hardly.  &quot;Officially&quot;, spam is not only unsolicited,
but almost always off-topic as well (when it comes to mailing lists and
newsgroups).  Spam is also usually cross-posted to multiple newsgroups and
email addresses, as well as considered to be of a &quot;dubious&quot; (usually
commercial) nature.  If I was trying to contact an old high school buddy
and sent emails to a half dozen people in the world with the exact same
name, it would not really be considered spam by most rational people
(especially if it was short, sweet, and to the point).  If I had posted a
URL to a paid adult XXX site to VintagVW, most people would consider that
spam (strangely, a post such as this made to the many adult USENET
newsgroups would not necessarily be considered spam-- this is where the
on-topic/off-topic part comes from).

Yours was neither unsolicited or off-topic.  When someone subscribes to a
mailing list or visits a newsgroup, they are opening themselves up for
unsolicited mail.  How else does a mailing list or newsgroup work?  You
simply CANNOT say &quot;only answers to MY posted questions&quot; are solicited.  If
you wade into the Amazon, don't blame the Piranha...

If we use an even broader definition of spam, I still wouldn't consider it
spam &quot;per se&quot;.  I, for one, was certainly not offended by your careful and
considerate approach to your post.  The post was certainly on-topic, since
we had just recently had a small discussion regarding the unwritten rules
of this list (I speak of the unwritten rule regarding buying and selling
stuff on this list).  The only think that I might suggest in the future
would be to put a little more detail into the message header.

Spam is usually a bigger deal in Europe, where most ISP time is paid for by
the minute.  Every minute downloading unwanted email is costing people
money.  There are similar global &quot;rules&quot; against phone solicitors calling
cell phone numbers because it cannot be ruled out that the receiver will
end up paying for the call.

OTOH, I'm sure you helped out more people than you offended.  For those
people whom you offended, I'm pretty positive that they probably don't make
a habit of complaining to all the companies that fill up their snail mail
boxes with pounds of paper per year.  You were offering a service, nothing
more.
