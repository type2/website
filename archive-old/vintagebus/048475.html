Subject: Josh R - new location &amp; info.

Due to a much larger number of people attending the funeral for Josh, the
location of the service has been changed.  As per post from Rob Dahlgren,
the new location is:

First  Baptist Church Assembly Center
located at 6th and Central
218 S. 6th
Ponca City, OK   74604
(580) 765-4427

Sorry for the change in location.  If anyone sent something to the Four
Square Church, the church, or someone will have it delivered to First
Baptist.

Also a memorial fund has been set up and will be administered by:

Chad Cantwell
#2 Longview
Ponca City, OK   74601
(580) 762-3972

You may direct any questions, cards, or gifts to Chad and he will get them
to Rachel.

A number of the bus group will be getting together after the funeral at Chad's.
