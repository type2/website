Subject: Re: [VB] pics...now engine light

While you're at the salvage yard, look into Datsun 260 or 280z's for their bullet shaped engine compartment light screwed to a fender. Switch on the back and the front light unfastens to reveal a 6' cord and a hanging hook.

&gt; I have a VW 181 (Thing) dash light that is switched (on-off) with the sliding
&gt; cover. Picked it up years ago always intending to install it in the, now sold,
&gt; 67 Westfalia.
