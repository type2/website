It's not right.  And then some.  Basically, I screwed it up 
seven ways to Sunday when I put it in the first time.  The main
rails are shifted 3/4&quot; to the driver's side, and the passenger side is
higher than the driver's side.  This was complicating matters when I
was doing the driver's side Big Panel replacement, the doglegs, etc.  
And the belly pans wouldn't have been able to go on correctly either.

Last Friday I got a massive shipment from Alan Schofield - new
frame center pieces, I-beams, outriggers, corners, battery trays, etc.
This metal cost more than a lot of people have paid for their cars!

&gt; &gt; second time &lt;*sigh*&gt;).  What might be the trick for his bus is to replace
&gt; So,
&gt; 
&gt; thom why do you have to re-do the frame?
