Subject: Stuck drum

My rear right drum is stuck on the splines.  I have a puller on it right
now, and it hasn't budged.  Been cranking it down slowly, hoping it will
crack it free.  I've banged on it and heated it, and made sure the brakes
are backed off.  Was going to try parafin wax, but don't know if that would
work, nor where to get some.  Any help would be most appreciated.
