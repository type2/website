&gt; Hi All,
&gt;
&gt; My 1500 motor for the tipper is almost complete starting from a 'no number'
&gt; case, rimco cw crank, rods, etc, and correct tin from Ronnie (oldvolks)...
&gt; inside it won't be as correct as maybe I'd like (it's actually a 1600 due to
&gt; shear bull headedness of Glenn who is building it... &quot;No one will be able to
&gt; tell except you on all the mountain passes around you&quot;) but from the outside
&gt; it will look as stock and og as possible... and if not, I'll change what
&gt; ever people complain about ;-)
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, I'm tempted to stamp the case with the original serial number and a
&gt; few people have told me this is highly illegal(!)  Accordingly, I called
&gt; both the DMV and the state police here in Oregon and both referred me to the
&gt; other... typical bureaucracy :-)   I explained that this was a restoration
&gt; process and I wasn't doing it to hide anything, just to be retentive.  They
&gt; both responded that they didn't see anything wrong with it since they look
&gt; only at the chassis number of an older vehicle such as this.
&gt;
&gt; Any thoughts, suggestions, insight, or previous experience?

It's perfectly legal unless you have an intent to defraud.  You're just
replacing parts after all!

What is illegal is altering an existing number.

I'd leave it blank.  You never know when some draconian law comes down the
pike requiring you to have a specific age engine or somesuch.  Leaving it
blank leaves your options open.
