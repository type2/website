Hi Diana,
You should look into a filter/oil pump to keep out the crud from the 
bearings.  The only problem with these is with the stock muffler you have to 
bend the heat riser tube coming out of the left front side of the muffler out 
of the way, and/or have this tube cut, and lengthened out of the way.

&lt;&gt;
Could mean anything!  Take a good look at the rod bearings that come out, for 
wear, and tear.  The PO may have only installed a set of P&amp;Cs, rebuilt heads 
on an old short block, and called it a rebuild.  The rod bearings could have 
been replaced at the same time or not.
   You probably can not afford much more time, and money right now, but we 
would just take the case apart at this point.  That way you can figure out 
how good or bad things are in there.  Especially the crank, and it's main 
bearings.
   If not then you really should start to put together a short block ASAP in 
the near future, and build it up to a long block when you can.  This way you 
can have it as a backup.  
    The sealing ring you mention sounds like a shim.  These are not a good 
idea between the head, and cylinder due to doubling the sealing sufaces that 
can go bad.  Best to shim only between the cylinder, and engine case instead!
