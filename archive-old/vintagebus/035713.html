Subject: Jerome as scheduled


There has been some question as to whether Jerome Jamboree will be canceled 
in light of today's insanity.

Well, I am only one on the ABC board, but as far as I am concerned, there are 
too many people with too much invested in making this Jerome Jamboree happen, 
to cancel it now.  In fact, if anything, it is times like this that folks 
need a plesant distraction and reason to live.  Besides, the mountains may be 
the only safe place on earth!!:)

Once all of the board members can get together, we will discuss the 
possibilities and options open to the ABC for helping the NYC and Washington 
victims.  The Red Cross is probably the best candidate right now, but we'll 
see.

See you at Jerome,

Jon
ABC
