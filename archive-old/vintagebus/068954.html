&gt; &gt; I'm using wheel bearing grease.

&gt; Hi Markus,
&gt; Good!  We use lithium front suspension and bearing grease.

&gt; &gt; I'm wondering about the tightening tho.  I tighten it sung, but so that I ca
&gt; &gt; still move the washer with a bit of force.

&gt; That does not sound so good.  We put everything together and then spin the
&gt; tire to help seat the bearings and snug the locking nut down till you feel
&gt; the bearings stopping the nut from snugging down anymore.  Then we turn the
&gt; nut back off 1/8 to 1/6 of a turn and lock it there.

Well, as I remember Bentley, you snug down the nut, spin the wheel back
and forth, then back off on the adjuster so that you can _just_ wiggle the
washer behind the lock nut with the tip of a screwdriver.  I interpret
this to mean that you don't have to pry the screwdriver against something
else, just push radially on the washer.

Another cause might be having one or the other outer race installed
crooked, which could happen if a metal fileing or somesuch got caught
between the hub and race.  This would probably show up as tight or loose
spots as the wheel is turned, though.  You could also have a bent spindle
which would have the same symptoms.

About the only real advice I have is to

1.  Take everything apart again,
2.  Make sure the hub is totally clean (as in solvent followed by alcohol
to the point where a white paper towel stays white when rubbing the
inside of the hub),
3.  Examine the hub surfaces to make sure that the outer races will seat
properly,
4.  Install the outer races with the proper driver (an old race
ground slightly small on the outside is fine)  You will hear a change in
the &quot;ring&quot; sound of the hub as the outer race seats)
5.  Install a new seal.  The old one is probably fine, but you can't tell
if it's contaminated.
6.  Grease the new bearings (since you're chasing a problem, I'd recommend
buying new grease and tossing the old, just in case of contamination)  Put
the proper amount of grease inside the hub too.  VW doesn't require as
much as most cars.
7.  Adjust per Bentley.  Remember that slightly loose is better
than slightly too tight, but take time to get it as close as possible.

George
