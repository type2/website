Hopefully summing up this thread...
now..if he stuck a cheapo motor in it and made it drive and put some glass in
there, he'd be in bidness :)  hell, even half as* pull some of those dents in
there to make it look a *little* better...then it MIGHT be worth
1750...MIGHT..in WI..thats what I think anyways...
I picked up my 63 with full length rack, 3 motors, 16 tires and rims..some
15&quot;ers in there, extra doors, extra front beam, extra trans, extra glass,
extra seats etc etc etc...and my frame is PERFECT. not a rust hole in
it...the rockers are toast..and some of the floor is iffy...but even the
crossmembers and jack points are PERFECT.  the nose has some dimples...but i
have an extra nose that came with it....all for a grand total of...get
this... $600.

Now really folks...do you think it would be worth that much if he made her
run, drive, and look half way decent?..I do..or close to that value depending
on the frame...he could do that all in a day anyways.

just my input..but as someone said before..what do i know..I'm just a kid.
