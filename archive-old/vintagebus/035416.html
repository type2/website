Subject: Re:  [VB] rear cargo door latch mechanism
To: mayesd_at_dsquared-dev_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com



My rear passenger door lock mechanism in my 59 double cab is shot...  The

part that the handle goes through with the square hole in it is wore out and

wobbles around.  The rest of the parts look OK.  The latches I have found

all have the little lock lever on it.  Mine does not.  Does anyone know if I

could get one of these other mechanism and scavenge internal parts from

it???

you can install a later latch mech with the lock rod in your earlier bus.   
If having the wrong version of the part in there bothers you, you can look 
for a good early one while you have a functional later one in situ.
