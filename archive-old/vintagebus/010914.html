Subject: whiring sound
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

    The dormobile is making a whiring/rattlie sound from the alternator/fan 
housing area, sounds kind of like a throw out bearing making its final spin 
but less harsh. It does it most when I engage the clutch or driving in high 
RPMs, it worsend considerably when I tightend the belt. 69 motor that looks 
to have a stock fan housing an alternator that looks fairly new, no obvious 
external cause. Could this possibly be something in the housing 
(cracked/flexing fan?) or am I buying a new alternator? any advice/tips are 
appreciated.
