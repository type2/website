Subject: Re: [VB] Jerome as scheduled

I have been sitting here all day watching the news wondering too about the
Jerome meet and affects of today's incidents.

I would like to suggest a way to help this tragedy we have all been watching
unfold in front of us today.  Last year I am aware that the chosen charity
was unable to take full advantage of the donations collected at the Jerome
Jamboree.  In the event of this again this year I thought that the overage
could be donated to the cause at hand.  This would bring such a positive
light to an event so close to this tragedy.

My 1.5 cents

&gt;
&gt; There has been some question as to whether Jerome Jamboree will be
canceled
&gt; in light of today's insanity.
&gt;
&gt; Well, I am only one on the ABC board, but as far as I am concerned, there
are
&gt; too many people with too much invested in making this Jerome Jamboree
happen,
&gt; to cancel it now.  In fact, if anything, it is times like this that folks
&gt; need a plesant distraction and reason to live.  Besides, the mountains may
be
&gt; the only safe place on earth!!:)
&gt;
&gt; Once all of the board members can get together, we will discuss the
&gt; possibilities and options open to the ABC for helping the NYC and
Washington
&gt; victims.  The Red Cross is probably the best candidate right now, but
we'll
&gt; see.
&gt;
&gt; See you at Jerome,
&gt;
&gt; Jon
