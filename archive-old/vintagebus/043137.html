Primer/surfacers are very porous.
BUT!  If you apply a catalyzed epoxy primer over the bare metal first OR
after you have prime/blocked the primer/surfacer....no problems at all as
long as the surface is not scratched.

&gt; a couple of years.
&gt; NB:  Things may have changed since I last investigated primers, but
&gt; that was the situation about five years ago.
