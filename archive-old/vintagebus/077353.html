Subject: another RGB question

I 'm almost ready to install the transaxle assembly in my '63, however I just noticed that the service manual shows that there should be spacers to the inside of the axle stub outer bearing?  I just replace these bearings, and there were no spacers.  
  Any ideas?  If I need these spacers, does anyone have a set they will sell to me?  I would hate to put this back together to find that I missed something that was screwed up by the PO.  I don't know if it makes a difference, but these are the big nut RGB's.
 
Thanks in advance,
Matt
