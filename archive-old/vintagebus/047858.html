I had the throw out arm in my bug (okay wrong type but same stuff as in a
splitty) throw up on me one day.    I speed shifted it directly home,
omitting the errands I was in process of running.     Thought it was the
cable, but 1) didn't want to change it where I was  and 2) ended up not being
the cable anyway.  I replaced the arm and shortly thereafter it had clutch
problems in downtown Oly.  Though hardly a metropolis, I didn't want to speed
shift  around downtown with all the traffic and top signs and stop lights and
steep hill to the west side with stop sign at the bottom so I speed shifted
it to a legal parking space and called for help (friend with bus and tow
rope).  The circlip had fallen off the arm and the bit the cable attaches to
had come off the arm.   Put it back together and it has held (so far).  moral
is...

no idea.
