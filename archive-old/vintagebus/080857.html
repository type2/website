&gt;curious, would those folks with bigger carbs or aftermarket
&gt;aircleaners have potential issues with the carb scavenging air FROM
&gt;the amount available to the cooling fan, or would it be vice-versa?

The best each cylinder in the engine can do is to suck in its whole
volume once every two revolutions.  Since there are four cylinders
on the engine, two cylinder volumes get sucked in on each revolution.

On page T-1 13 of the '63-'67 Bentley, it says that the engine is
1493 cc, and that the cooling system air output is about 550 liters
per second at 3800 rpm.  550 l/sec * 60 sec/1 min is 33,000 L/min,
or about 1170 ft^3/min, for the cooling fan.

The engine will be sucking (1.493 / 2) L/rev * 3800 rev/min or
2837 L/min, or about 100 ft^3/min.  This is a maximum number;
it will actually be sucking less than this.

So, the cooling fan is sucking at least eleven times as much air as
the engine is.

Based on this, my guess would be that nothing you could do to the
intake system would make it take enough additional air to detract
much from the cooling system.
