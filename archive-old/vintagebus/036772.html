&lt;&lt; 1) Tranny has 4th pop out.  Hopefully I can rig it in for long Interstate
 drive.  In spirit of good Karma, I'm already checking on getting a rebuild
 (2 weeks lead time). Todd Hill tells me he is short cores on '63 and down
 tranny.  I presume I want to stay with the original style (&quot;small nut&quot;?).
 Is this sensible?  I will be running 1600DP, so not stock engine... and I
 plan on having Todd go with the better R&amp;P. &gt;&gt;
Hi Stephen,
Make sure you take two gallons of tranny oil and change it after the first 100
mles and have the other gallon just in case.  We use Sta-Lube 85/90WT with the
easy fill pump you can buy seperately.  You really should consider going to a
1964-67 front and rear suspension for safety with 20% bigger brakes that feel
more like 50% bigger.  You can also use the 1967-68 tranny center section for
either way you go with the modified tranny.   Eric &amp; Barb
