OK, enough of the Japan bashing, first of all they DO USE them like us, look
at the pics of a Japan camp-out on Thom's and/or Everetts site. What would
of happened if the Germans decided to export to Japan and not the U S, we
would all be buying our buses from Japan and they probally would be saying
the same thing about us. At least the people from Japan are buying the buses
MOST of us couldn't afford anyway and helping to fire up the market to help
sell buses. Now if I was worried about buses going overseas, I would be
bashing the ENGLISH, they buy up all the parts and buses we can afford and
ship them to England!!!!! really inflating the market on POS buses and parts
which in turn goes down the gauntlet and affects all of us more then a
Japanese purchase ever would.


ronnie,  (your still my friend John?)

 let whoever wants to buy them buy them, most of the buses going overseas
weren't wanted by anyone here anyway. I sold a 66 HT Deluxe to England
because nobody here wanted a rust free bus for 800 dollars!!! and I tried to
sell it here for 2 months before it was sold overseas.

hide all the busses, especially from the aliens and their pesky ufo's. 
then burn all the rest and crush the carcasses into new sardine cans.
i don't know the site my old bus wound up on, but many people told me about
it, and i did see it.  this was last summer.
beware of so-cal middlemen and guys at shows with briefcases full of money.
(i'm not joking about this, it does exist)
