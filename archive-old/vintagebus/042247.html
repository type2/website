Subject: Great Race hits Santa Clarita

The Great Race (the History Channel one, not the other one) passed through
Santa Clarita (next valley north of LA) today.  I didn't know it was going
through, but on the way back from breakfast I glimpsed the Hebmueller with
&quot;Great Race&quot; insignia on it going the other way down Soledad Canyon road.
By the time I got turned around he was long gone, though, and I quickly
discovered that a '49 356 engine in a Heb can outrun a Mexican engine
in a loaded bus.  Ah well, at least I got to see it!
