 Well, Ive struck out at all the local service yards.   Does anyone have any
 interior door handle assemblies for sale.  I have a 64 but its an early
 model with icepick outside handles, so it uses the flat pull bar inside, NOT
 the round one.  I just need the ratchet and cotter pin assembly that
 attaches to the bar.  Handles would be nice too.
  &gt;&gt;
you just need the part that the inside handle goes to, not the bar or the bit 
that the outside handle goes to?  Yes, got one, 

Clara
