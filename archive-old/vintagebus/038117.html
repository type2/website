&lt;&lt; Then in
 1968 VW introduced the type 4 as the notch/round/square backs using the same
 engine that was installed into the 1972 and later buses.  Unfortunitly VW
had
 redesigned the type 3 body designs for the type 4 with what amounted to
using
 an ugly stick and square bumpers on them.  The type 4 VWs were a extreme
 dissappointment for VW due to low sales and about 1974 they discontinued
 production of this line of VW.     Eric&amp;Barb &gt;&gt;

Actually the 411 &amp; 412's had very little to do with the Type 3's.  The Type 4
was pretty much built from the ground up as a new idea.  Though they did use
Type 3 rear brakes, the Type 4's are wider, longer, and quite a bit faster
than the Type 3.
  The Type 4's engine has more in common with the 914 engine than the bus and
even where availiable from the factory with a very hefty 80 horse power.
As for being a disappointment for VW, this is pretty agreed upon, thou the
car did sell rather well overseas.  The good old USA just wasn't ready for a
$4,400 VW (the original sticker price of my 73')  These cars today are
actually becomming somewhat rare, but can still be picked up for next to
nothing.  I paid $800 for my 412 with a little over 60,000 miles on it, the
car is almost like new, even has killer A/C!!
   Peace, Love, and you may laugh all you want at the Type 4, but when your
done--go price an Edsel,
