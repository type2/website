Subject: more carb questions

anyone run a 28 PICT carb on a 1600 DP engine? I got done putting a 
30 PICT-1 on there, but the little idle cut-off valve is loose and it 
seems the threads might be stripped on the carb. I could probably fix 
it, but I've got a 28 PICT that I could clean up and put on. Any 
reason not to do this?

My reason for switching carbs is the 34 PICT carb I've got is really 
dogged and I'm not comfertable with it. I don't know how much more it 
will last, and I'd like to go to a simpler type of carb. I know other 
people have run the 30 PICTs on their 1600 DP's and that was my plan. 
But if it's OK to use the 28 PICT, I'd probably like to go that 
route. Very simple carb. No idle cut-off valve. Basic

The 34 PICT on the other hand seems to be difficult to adjust and 
never seems right. Always seems to be running rich. Don't trust it 
either.

Any experiece out there with experimenting with all these different 
carbs on a 1600DP engine?
