&gt;I joust bought a 67 Deluxe and before I drive it any where I must 
&gt;replace the brake shoes.  I ahve never done this on Drum brakes.
&gt;Does anyone know if is it any more difficult or easy than chnanging
&gt;brake pads on a mid-70's baywindow.

It's more difficult but still doable.  You have to take the drum off
and unhook some springs.  (This also means you have to adjust the
front wheel bearings when you put the front drums back on.)  

The Idiot manual has a fairly good procedure.  The Bentley manual has 
pictures that show how everything goes, which can help if you get lost.
Working on just one side at a time also lets you use the other side as
a reference.  http://www.type2_dot_com/library/reading.htm has more on manuals.

The adjustment procedure in the Library
http://www.type2_dot_com/library/brakes/brakeadjust.html has a bit on the
replacement procedure and a lot of good info on how to adjust the brakes
after replacement.

Good luck!
