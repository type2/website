Subject: Re: FW: [VB] Trailering Bus

How does it compare to towing, I would think it would
be better to have all the wheels off the ground for a
distance of 800 miles.

&gt; The best way to get a bus from point A to point B

&gt; bar and in the last 2
&gt; years we've towed probably at least 10 different
&gt; buses for various reasons.  By far one of the most
&gt; valuable tools I've seen
&gt; for bueses.  It's a one time investment for
&gt; a lifetime of care-free bus-towing.
