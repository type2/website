Drivers, I'd be walking if I didn't drive one of my buses daily, If your bus
gets totaled it's still cheaper to replace then that new SUV or fancy
Pick-Up most people seem to drive. Complain about bus part prices, try to
replace any part on that new vehicle you drive! Headlight assembly 375.00,
or how bout a tail light assembly? New jetta a good deal is 175.00, more
then those 58-61 bus ones. If you got it drive it, don't be afraid to, I put
20,000 plus miles on my buses a year, been lucky I guess I haven't been in a
wreck, but if I do I hope it's the other persons fault so at least I'll get
paid off on my bus, so I could get another. I have dinged and scratched my
buses but that's all part of driving, NO TRAILER QUEENS for me, Soon I will
have my 66 Deluxe on the road and then my 63 Double Cab (fs). All my buses
get a complete mechanical going over to assure safety, my 62 panel was done
3 years ago, at least 40,000 miles on it and all mechanicals are all still
in excellent shape, so the one time investment does pay off in the long run,
you still have to maintain them, but a new car will also brake if not
maintained properly.

My point, drive them if you have them, it's the joy of driving not the
rarity, heck my 1961 notch Porsche 356, was rarer then any bus I own and I
drove it daily in the BIG CITY.

When I heard that most accidents happen close to home, I moved...

&gt;In light of the evidence posted, and the apocraphal stories not posted,
all accidents are close to home. That's where we do the most driving. When
we and the opposition are in unfamiliar territory, we pay attention to the
Usual Nonsense going on.  Yeah, it's the usual drive
to-work-listen-to-the-local-morningjerks, or it's We're Driving To Our
Vacation Destination! Which has the adrenilin? Which has the rewards of
lower risks? Yep... get on the road and go.
