Subject: paint / chat / roof dents
Date: Fri, 3 Jul 1998 11:45:35 -0500

first let me thank eric and barb - for bursting (my fix the roof dents bye
(sp) adding a sunroof)  bubble (i must admit it did seem too easy). so i
guess that means i either find an old roof or *gasp* try and fix those
dents and the support pieces.

today's problem tho is the unavailability of paint - it appears that it is
not possible for me to obtain mango green and sea gull grey in canada - (i
must confess to not being completely excited about mango green anyway) -
but if anyway knows of where i could order it from in the US please let me
know.

wouldnt a list chat room be handy - i mean i could simply go there and ask
my simple niave questions with out revealing my ignorance before the entire
list - does anyone else agree - there is a vw channel on efnet - but it
really sucks - i suppose becuase so few people go there - anyway - i think
it would be useful
 
again thanks to eric and barb - it would really have been aweful to attempt
a sunroof and ruin my bus
