Subject: stock height non-flipability

Hi,

In my &quot;what-was-I-thinking&quot; days I put my bus on the line many times.

I once raced my neighbor who had a 914 and kept up with him around the 
corners &lt;lots of second gear&gt;. Granted he pulled away on the 
straights...but I never did flip (thank you). And that was on Sears 
Treadmaster 145's!

By comparison the 78 GREEN Westy I had - talk about top-heavy loafs. [I 
love Westies by the way, just not that one.]

Conrad
