Thanks for the details, I ended up leaving my bus at home.
Had a great time at OCTO, met Thom and a bunch of other wild
and crazy guys and girls. Advertized my steering wheel
restorations. Many people liked what they saw and made nice
compliments. As always money talks, and b walks.

&gt; My brother, a San Jose cop, got back to me and said this
about safari windows:
&gt;
&gt;     &lt;&lt;There are a few codes that apply.  One is
&quot;windshield requirements&quot;.
&gt; Yes,
&gt; there is a windshield there, but it is in the up position
which makes it
&gt; useless for its purpose as such.  Another is, &quot;defective
vehicle equipment&quot;,
&gt; which is a catch-all to any part of the vehicle.  That can
be used because
&gt; the windshield is up and is not being used as it should,
to deflect road
&gt; debris, insects, and wind which can distract the driver to
safely operate the
&gt; vehicle.  Another is if the safari window is half-way up,
&quot;view obstructed&quot;,
&gt; which can be used just like an air freshener tree or
parking placard hanging
&gt; from the rear-view mirror in the way of the driver's clear
view through the
&gt; windshield.  Another is, &quot;windshield wipers required&quot;.
Yes, you have two
&gt; windshield wipers, but if the windows are up, usually the
wipers are folded
