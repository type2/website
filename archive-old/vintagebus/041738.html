&gt; &lt;&lt; On Ronnie's advice, I used a Brazilian PICT30/31-3 Brosol with the
&gt; included adapter on my Mexican engine in my '71 bus.  It worked fine from
&gt; the get-go with a .009 distributor.  &lt;Snip&gt;  The tailpipe is running black 
&gt; even after a long highway run, so the power loss isn't due to a lean mixture.

&gt; Hi George,
&gt; Did you try a bigger air correction jet?  Is this on a SP or DP engine?

Dual port with adapter.

I haven't tried any jetting changes yet.  I'd just as soon have it a bit
rich than too lean!

George
