Subject: Foobared brake on the 66!:(

Hrm.  went out to look at that 65 for Chris, and just before i got there,
hit the brakes for a yield sign.....thrphrmp!  First thing that poped into
my mind as I grabbed the e-brake was that the master cylinder went out!
(6 new w/c's, 4 rubber lines, yadeya) Old shoes though.  Pressed the pedal
again after I pulled over, and had about 1/4 of the brakes I should.

Hrm, says I.  Wierd.   Less then a mile from where I suspect the 65 to be,
so I head on.  On the way, the front sorta kerthunks, and I tap the brake.
Full pressure again!  Wierd.

Check them again in a few, and they work, then they kerthumpht.  Hrm.
Kinda tries to lock up the wheel.  Hrm.  Left front.

So, I suspect that perhaps the old shoes (looked good, solid, plenty of
pad..) decided to come apart on me.  Doesnt really explain the lack of
pedal at the one point, though.

50 some odd miles home, and tomorrow after work, i'll check it out.

Still, one problem in the first ~490 miles since '76 aint bad....

later....david
