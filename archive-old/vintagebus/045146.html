&lt;&lt; Anyone have any luck using their AAA plan to move a project car around, 
i.e.
 bring one home from a shop?
  &gt;&gt;
As long as it looks road worthy (glass, a muffler hanging out the back, air 
in most of the tires etc.), and has current plates(ie; the plate off your 
other ride) they don't usually hassle to much. if it is obviuosly a project, 
they call it a courtesy tow and won't want to do it. although I have managed 
to get them to tow a bus without an engine a short distance with some 
creative story telling. I've been wanting to make a deal that would hang a 
muffler out under the bumper with no engine in the bus, just for this 
purpose. it helps to have a second person to drive the other car home, so it 
looks at least somewhat like you may have broken down. strangely some of the 
drivers actually do care.
