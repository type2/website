OK...

Thanks for the input, E&amp;B, Clara, Robert...

I removed the zerks, and cleaned out the grease with Q-tips, and found that
the bushings had been drilled.  So far so good.  Still can't get grease to
go in.  I have feeling that when I call Bus Boys, I will be told that they
need to seat and wear in....they did mention in their instructions that they
are gonna be tight, and to grease them in 100 miles, and again in 500.  No
problem there, as long as I can get the grease to go in then!

Also, this message serves to set the record straight...I don't like implying
a lack of attention to detail or carelessness, especially without full and
accurate data, and as far as Bus Boys is concerned, they did everything
correctly as far as I can tell.

Now to drive down to a flat parking lot to try to get my toe-in set
correctly.  I don't have room enough to roll straight for 20 feet in my
drive (gravel, rutted)...just the 12 feet of garage.  My test drives were
uncomfortable....something is definitely off, and the bus tends to jump and
wander...not what I expected!  Hopefully all will be OK...just gotta get the
bus into town for a real alignment (I hope!)
