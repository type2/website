Thanks Eric and Barb for the info on solderig the contacts in my headlight
switch. I had heard that mentioned a couple times, but didn't understand until
you mentioned drilling out the rivets...I thought the problem was the conacts
of the wires to the switch.

I just finished putting it back together. i used #6 x 1/2&quot; bolts and nuts to
hold it back together...for future reference. Some questions regarding:

&quot;For pre-1961 light switches clean and solder the rivet connections inside,
for post-1960 do the same and also solder each of the two pieces of brass on
the outside/forward of the switch together.&quot;

My bus is a '65, i couldn't figure out what you meant by the two piesces of
brass on the outside/forward part of the switch. I soldered all the brass tabs
that were riveted to the black plastic part.

One other question...I only drilled out the two rivets that held the whole
assembly together...there was a third rivet i  noticed, but i didn't think i
needed to drill it out.

I have reassembled everything, my headlights seem white now(as opposed ot the
dimmer yellow glow of before...I am pretty sure i need to adjust the bulb
position. I know which screws to adjust, Bentley refers to some wall chart
(which i don't have)for adjustment and Muir just says aim 6&quot; below horizontal
for low, and aim for horizontal on high...my question how far from a wall
should i be?

I will be taking it out on the road soon, and see if i notice a difference.
The switch seems cooler already, but i don't think i will know until i take it
for a drive. 

When i put on my high beams, i can really see the blue light glow! The red
light in the speedo which used to glow faintly whenever i turned my lights on,
still comes on, but is barely perceptible...until i rev the engine a little. 

If you haven't done this to your bus yet...do it today it is much easier than
i thought.

Thanks again
will report more after road tests...
'65 kombi
