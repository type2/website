Subject: Re: [VB] packing oil pump for easier priming

Don't know if this will help you but I prime my engine by removing the plugs
(or at least loosening them) and then I have a big bar bolted to a stock
pulley.  I put that pulley on the crankshaft and then I insert a stubby
screwdriver in a hole that I drilled in the end of the bar and basically
make a big crank out of it.  Then I just crank by hand until oil comes out
of the sender hole.  That way I know I've primed the pump.  Put the sender
in and crank some more to fill the cooler and you're set!!!
