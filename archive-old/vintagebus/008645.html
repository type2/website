brake fluid is hygroscopic.
it absorbs water from humidity in the air.
when the brakes get hot, this heat transmits to the fluid,
the water  in the fluid boils, and vaporizes. this makes bubbles of
oxygen and hydrogen , trapped in the brake lines. these bubbles are
compressible, and pressure on the pedal becomes spongy, or soft.
this is brake pedal fade. compounded with the glazing of the brake
material surface and the gasses  coming from the binder material,
or glue, from which the pads or shoes are made, all leads up to
very poor performance.
brake fluid should be changed regularly. pay attention to the color of the
fluid when new, and notice the color as it ages. also note the discoloration
coming from deteriorating rubber seals in the brake master and wheel
cylinders. bleed your brakes when the pedal feels spongy, and adjust the
brakes when the pedal is low. this is not rocket science, brakes are pretty
basic on your bus, and with reasonable attention will perform adequately.
