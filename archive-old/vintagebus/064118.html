Subject: RE: [VB] With the exception of David Mayes . . .

Well, I just have to respond....  :-)

I make sure that the part going back on is 'VW' made and if i'm trying to be
more picky, its to try and find a part that is of the era...  i'm not german
biased, just og biased.

Now, on the other hand, i've collected parts for the 59 double cab from:
Australia, Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Canada, Belgium,
France, England, US, Philippians, New Zealand, etc.

Hey Curt, you should have him come back with a few canisters of *german air*
for the tires ;-)

&gt;&gt;&gt; twas rit:  . . . I think our air-cooleds are truly the &quot;international
vehicle.&quot;  Parts from everywhere, . . . Poland, Denmark, Israel, Italy,
Japan, Korea, Taiwan, U.S.A. France, Mexico, Brazil, Australia, South Africa
and, . . . oh yeah, . . . Germany.

My son is coming home Wednesday from East Germany.  He's been working over
there for an industrial organization that represents manufacturers of
electric
&quot;e&quot; bikes, . . . fairly big over there.  I told him not to come home without
a
cache of semaphores.
