Subject: RE: [VB] 2.1L on 1600 case engine/carb ?

For type 1/2 up to 1910cc I'll stick with a center mount re-jetted 2bbl
Weber progressive with modified 1 3/8&quot; intake runners into off the shelf 044
heads. Seems to work fine for me.

some people like dual carbs, but from what I hear it seems you have to mess 
and tinker with them a lot.   I have never done a fat motor, so I dunno, but

am sure it'd be fine to use what you have.  I am surprised that some of the 
fat motor folks have not responded, maybe retitle the post to get their 
attention....

think veewee111 thought you were using a pancake (72-79) motor

 &lt;&lt; is your 2110 on a later (type IV) or earlier (upright) style case?
  
  ya, think your question is a bit vague,   myself I like to keep it simple 
(1600sp), and that way it's more reliable.   So maybe I don't have much to 
offer you for advice, anyway &gt;&gt;
 
 yea its a upright 1600 case as-41 bored and stroked to  2110
 im usually quite happy with a 1600 or maybe 1649 but this just sort of fell

in my lap and i was wondering how to make the best of it and use it in the
DC.
 I was looking thru my carb stash and i have a set of brosals and a set of 
kadrons
 and was wondering if these are suficient for this motor?
 i also have a set of 44mm ida's         would these be better suited to the

motor?
 for the ignition i'll probably go with a Jacobs pointless system.
