Subject: RE: Tube vs Tubless (was tires, i will have the answer)

George Wrote: 
&gt; 
&gt; Well, tubes are a lot easier to fix in the bush than tubeless, and
&gt; also seal well no matter how dirty or rusty the rim bead area might
&gt; be.  Also, cars sold outside the US might not be equipped with DOT
&gt; rims that have the tubeless bead retention groove.

Be aware that the older VW rims don't have bead retention grooves either
(little bumps inside the sealing surface of the rim). You run the risk
of a quick flat with a blow to the sidewall running tubeless with these
rims. I'm at work, don't have my reference mat'l, so I can't say what
years. Specifics should be in the archives in a post on rims or tires,
as I recall.
