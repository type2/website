Too cool!  I just went over to the local dealer and
picked up the Bus and they also had a Signle cab
version with a surfboard in the bed.  With the two
bodies, the &quot;guts&quot;, two batteries, a radio, and a
charger, the whole deal came to less than $250. 
Pretty cool, they also had a late 60's Baja Bug
displayed as well.  They guy at the store said that if
you don't have experience (or lots of time), just go
with the electric.  The gas powered ones are fairly
new, and the advances in gas powered R/C stuff is
happening quickly these days.
