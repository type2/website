Hello All...
 Tonight I got the feul tank &amp; started cuttin out the
bad rusty spots... It actually rusted from the outside
in, where the felt stuff us between the tank &amp; body.
 Anyway, to the questions... first after I weld in the
new plates to cover the gappin holes that are now in
it, whats the best way to seal it back up? Will the
stuff that you put in your tank to slosh around (I
forgot the name) do it, or is it just to seal the
inside up to keep it from rustin? Im a pretty decent
welder but want to make sure its sealed right... I
went the FLAPS &amp; they had a cheesy repair kit, but
didnt get it... I want see what the experts have to
say first:)
 Second, when I cut the tank &amp; got to lookin around in
there for... well, whatever.... noticed there is a
rubber line stickin up from the outlet on the inside
of the tank..Make sense? Its a good 3 inches long,
reaches up the center of the baffles inside... This
would mean that at 1/2 to 1/4 of a tank, Id run out of
fuel! It could be in there to help keep trash from
goin to the pump.... Ideas?
 Please no flames... I realize a new tank is only
around $125, but if I can fix this one for $20, and a
few hours of work, thats the route to take:)
Thanks,
