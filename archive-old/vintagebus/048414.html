Subject: re:Ignition Switch/Headlight Problem

If that is still my old 55 single cab it has a starter relay up next to the
starter, outside of the engine compartment, and next to the tranny. If I
remember right those wires could definitely use some cleaning and
tightening. You really do need to unhook the battery. I almost burned up my
crew cab a few years back from wiring malpractice. I bet if you clean and
rejoin everything things will come around. How is the truck doin'?
