Subject: Fitting my Thermador cooler to a bus?
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Okay, this may not work because of the door design, but I wondered if anyone
had ever fit a Thermador cooler to a splitscreen bus... How did it work?  Was
it worth the trouble?  If anyone needs them I have a copy of the original
instructions to a Sea Aire evaporation cooler from 1959.  Does anybody have
similar information for the Thermador?  One last question... Anybody out there
interested in a pair of NOS amber or clear vent wing air deflectors?  I can
send a scan of them if you are interested.  These are not German, but were
made in the 1950's.
