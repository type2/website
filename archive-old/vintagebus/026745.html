Subject: update and parts

It has been awhile since I have posted anything to the list.  I am
currently in the process of getting my front bumper reworked.  I
purchased a decent front bumper from a local VW mechanic.  I then
decided to get it straightened with a local bumper place.  I told them
just to straighten it and that is ALL.  A couple weeks rolled by and I
called and they said that it was ready.  I go to the shop and the guy
asks what did I want done to my bumper.  My first response was, &quot;what
did you do to my bumper?&quot;  He stated that they just can not &quot;straighten&quot;
it.  There are too many ping marks so they have to grind it down to make
it a smooth.  My heart just sank.  Well, not too much into the bumper so
no big loss.  I walked to the back of the shop and I was amazed.  The
bumper looked like it just rolled of the production line.  Amazing!  A
little thinner metal but straight as an arrow ( curved arrow that is).
Next, finding a place that uses Glazurit paint or something close.

I have a couple parts that I need for my 66 deluxe hardtop.  I do not
have much to  trade but the green stuff seems to work.  Not looking for
NOS.  Restorable works for me.

1.  The bent metal piece that goes between the walk thru seats that
holds down the mat.  There is two of these pieces.  I need the one that
goes towards the back of the bus.

2.  Slash style aluminum trim for the rear bumper. 2 pieces.  (I know
that I have a 66 which came with point style bumpers but I have a slash
style in the back.)

3.  End caps to the jail bar that is located above the rear seat.  I
think that they are plastic but not too sure.
