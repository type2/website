&gt; Mark,
&gt;      Answer, YES. The generator is a sort of analog function, going up and
&gt; down in effectiveness as revs change and load varies.
&gt; Alternators are more yes/no affairs. they come full on at just off idle and
&gt; stay there pretty much regardless. This is better, Go get it.

But if you don't need the additional amperage to run a big dumb thumpin
stereo, you may want to keep the generator. They last longer. No diodes
to poop out. (But then with a gen you have a voltage reg to poop out,
but it is easier to fit in the spare box than an alt) 

I have alternators in each of my vee wees at the moment, and they are ok
too.
