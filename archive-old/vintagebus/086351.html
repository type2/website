Subject: Clutch Pedal Doesn't Return

About a week or two ago my clutch pedal started to feel a bit more  
&quot;tight&quot; when I depressed it.  It was also a bit jumpy coming out of  
gear.  (This is on my '67 Freedom Camper)

I imagined that this might have something to do with the cold weather  
(lubrication not cutting it at low temps?) but wasn't sure.

Well, yesterday on my way into work it got significantly worse and  
when I depressed the clutch pedal, the pedal did NOT return (come  
up).  I could pull up the pedal with my toe and the clutch would  
disengage (allowing me to drive) but it wouldn't come up on it's own.

I tightened the cable (it seemed loose even though the freeplay had  
seemed about right when checked before tightening) and now the  
freeplay seems &quot;more right&quot; but the clutch is hard to depress - it  
feels like it's binding.

I also verified that:
   (a) the spring on the throw-out bearing arm is in place and  
working, and
   (b) the bowden tube is tightly attached to it's mount and has a  
bend in it.

My next step is to pull the clutch cable. I expect that I'm going to  
find it's frayed somewhere in the middle and as a result, binding in  
place.  Hopefully it'll come out without any major problems.

Any thoughts, however, on other things I might look into would be  
welcome.

Cheers,
