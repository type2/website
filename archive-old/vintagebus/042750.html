As for airless compressors...

they are junk, but they will work for a while.

HP ratings are all a bunch of lies nowadays.  Comapre how many amps the
motors draw and you will find out that just about any 110/115V compressor
has the same rating, they just lie more on the ones with bigger tanks so
you will be parted from more dough.

Basically, they overload the motor until it siezes, the HP rating is how
much it can pull just before it turns into a boat anchor.

So check the amp draw.  (i think for the math inclined there is a way to
figure out HP given voltage and amps) its the only number on those things
that tells you anything.

I bought an oilless compressor because my current
garage has 110v, but when i build my own garage it will have 220v.  I dont
see any point in buying a fancy 110 compressor when in the future i will
have 220 available. If this one survives it will end up being my basement
workshop compressor for airbrushing and small stuff like that.

So oilless will get you by, but consider it thrown away money.  Eventually
the thing will fail and probably not be worth fixing... but you can keep
the tank anyway... if industrious you could put a real motor and
compressor on top of it.

take care,

Steve
