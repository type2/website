Subject: [VB] Painters, ever experiance this? (Paint trouble on DC)


&gt; Anyone ever experience this?  I painted the interior
&gt; of my DC 2 weeks ago.  Turned out great.  Paint flowed
&gt; well with only a few runs.  Painted the exterior last
&gt; weekend and man....  It defiantly did not turn out
&gt; well.  The paint went completely flat.  Everywhere.
&gt; Not a spot of shiny paint on it.  The paint did not
&gt; flow great but i think that is because i did not put
&gt; enough on the body.  the places were it did flow it is
&gt; still flat.
