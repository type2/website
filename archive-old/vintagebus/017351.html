Hey Rex
Let me relay a new angle on your rod knock problem. 
Along with my Splits, I have owned a 73 Super Beetle
for 17 years. I bought the car from the second owner
who had it a couple of years (happened to be a sister
in law)so I know the history of the bug going back to
the beginning. The engine is still the original engine
that HAS NOT been rebuilt! The engine still runs
strong and passes smog.
Now.....About ten years ago, I went out and started
the bug to go to town and heard a god awful sound that
I knew to be a rod knock, bummer. I was afraid to
drive it for fear of impending doom, but, I drove it
to the store a couple of times without problems,so off
to longer drives, and getting bolder, driving it to
work.
Well, ten years later,and about fifty thousand miles,
the engine still knocks like hell, but, still running
well. Sounds like a knock, feels like a knock???
Running good and strong, so how much longer before the
explosion, time will tell.

Maybe you should get a second opinion before you tear
it down for a rebuild.

Good luck
Chuck Notmeyer
