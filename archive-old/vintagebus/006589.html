OK, but we allready have the Red Barn swap and Camp-out the day before Kelly
Park and Split Bus Club has there pre KP camp-out the night before. Why
don't you get together with whoever does those and help expand that, the Red
Barn was a blast and I wouldn't want to miss it, as was SBC/VTO camp-out, 2
not to miss events.

Ronnie,  loves the pre show camp-outs, especially wouldn't want to miss VW
Howard in action.

And I'll just mention quietly that the Silicon Valley Chapter of Strictly 
Vintage 2s hopes to put on an all-Bus meet somewhere in the San Jose area 
the day before Kelley Park.  So if you are still hoping to make KP with the 
new regulations, consider coming up the day before and attending our show.  
No guarantees it will happen for sure, but it's definitely something we're 
working hard on.  :)
