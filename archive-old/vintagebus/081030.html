&gt;I think what Dave meant to say was Radar Electronics. I get a lot of my
&gt;wire and various piece parts for electronic projects from them. You

the problem comes down to cost piecemeal vs bundle... several places 
on the web (and around phoenix) sell wire by the foot, but after 
adding up each size and length i am usually no better off than the 
cost of the bundled wire - plus i get to wrap the damn thing myself! 
:)
trailer companies here want nearly  $100, since they add in custom 
labor; most bulk wire sellers here won't sell retail. auto and 
hardware stores rarely have 8+ gauge, and then you  are back to 
nearly $1/ft.

that's why i am hoping someone wants to go in on the PREbundled 100ft 
spool - 3 people = ~ $35_at_ shipping included.

part of my frustration is that i was SPOILED in austin - i lived next 
to 2 scrapyards (3, if you count the packrat neighbor) and 2 surplus 
houses. i could prolly find all the wire i needed just lying in the 
streets; heck, we'd find whole CARS abandoned by the driveway! sadly, 
they were all compacts, and none of the harnesses i stripped out of 
them are long enough.......

here in phoenix, by the time i find someone who has what i need, i 
face a drive up to 70 miles, so add nearly $10 for gas :P
