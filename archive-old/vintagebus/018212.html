It's for the accessory rear speakers.

&gt; Hey all. Can anyone tell me what the extra wire leading all the way back
&gt; along the roof line and down out near the rear hatch hooks up to. This
&gt; is for a 58 Deluxe. Is it for a heated rear window? It is a factory wire
&gt; and I have seen them on other buses but was just curious cause I've
&gt; never seen it hooked up. Also there is no mount for an extra dome light
&gt; so I figured it wasn't for that.
