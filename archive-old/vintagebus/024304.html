Subject: petrol heater

Hi Gang,
Can anyone tell me what a petrol heater out of a 69/70 camper would be
worth $? I have not seen it yet and owner wants to get rid of it.
he took it out of the camper and sold the bus without it.
Now he want's to sell it.
It has a vw part number and is supposed to be working.
also is this heater different from split screen buses? from bay window
buses?
Any info would be great,
Thanks
