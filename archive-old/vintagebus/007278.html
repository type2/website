There was a website that I checked out quite some time ago that actually
told of one guys' exploits of cutting down a bay windows camper interior and
fitting it into a splitty.  The only thing I can remember is that the closet
had to be shortened - oh say about 3 inches or so.  There was more involved
I'm pretty sure.  Can anyone come forth with this web page?  I seemed to
have failed to bookmark it or simply can't find it in my pile of bookmarks.
I think Andre could really use this information...
