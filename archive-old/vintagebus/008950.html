the vanbondo sez:
&gt;I hold cardboard on the off/on ramps to the Phoenix freeways.

Wow, that was you?  You owe me a large letter Sekurit Barndoor windshield,
it's all bubbly now.  :p

Me?  I don't do anything, I just work on a web site.  I have some hidden
JavaScript that charges your credit card every time you look at a classified
ad...

Hey, go visit, I need to buy some parts,
