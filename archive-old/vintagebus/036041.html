&lt;&lt; I took them back to Les Schwab and they said they would warranty them. It 
seems everyone agrees that the 205-75-15 is the right size, why is it that 
these are a LOT taller than the 165 15? &gt;&gt;
Hi Craig,
205R15 is a slight under sized compared to the original 6.4&quot;x15 bias ply 
tires (Dia. 27&quot;) from the factory for type 2 1955-63.  165R15 is right on 
diameter (25&quot;) for the type 1 from 1955-1967ish 5.6&quot;x15 bias ply from the 
factory.
  Make sure to get as high a load rating as possible and good tread that at 
the same time does not produce lots of road noise.  Like the old song goes 
&quot;Don't let your wheels drive you crazy.&quot;.
