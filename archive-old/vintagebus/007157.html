Currently an almost completely restored '59 Deluxe Beetle with the tail in
the air on jackstands, (but the bus lives there!  It's just renting it out
to the '59 for now!)  My assortment of VW tin signs and original magazine VW
adds for decor.  I just built a storage area hanging from the ceiling, using
major overkill on structural support so as to store the original 36hp
(correct numbers!) for the '59 (sporting a 40mm dual Webered 1776 for now),
transaxles, bumpers, and the like.  Working now on texturing the whole
garage and painting, so Gretchen ('62 Standard) can have her own room.

Only a single car garage at this place; still trying to figure how to get
all three of my VW's in a one car garage to appease the classic auto
insurance gods.
