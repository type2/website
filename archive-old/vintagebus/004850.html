        Hey Andre,

            With all due respect,once show season begins( May)there is a
show every weekend,pretty much,and every show has a swap meet. Now, every
show may not have a huge swap meet but many do!
Also my experience is that here in the midwest you may not have the
abundance of used parts,as Ca. does, but you also won't pay &quot;inflated&quot;
prices as I have seen being paid for items at Ca. swap meets.
        Also if you would consider joining our bus club &quot;Der Busbesitzer
Gruppe&quot; you would have the added advantage of bartering with fellow
members.We are now over 80 members strong and growing!
        I look forward to seeing you at some shows this summer!
Go to our clubs website and look at 2000
events,the list of happenings is long!  http://www.dreamwater_dot_com/dbg

                                     &quot;keep on pushin' &quot;

I can only say that without eBay I wouldn't get the parts I needed.
&gt; Here, in the great Midwest there are no swap meets and shows are sporadic.
I
&gt; can only say, do your homework before you bid and bid accordingly.
&gt;
&gt; Later,
&gt;
&gt;
