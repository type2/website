hey all,
i was taking the rear view blocker cabinet out of the SO44 parts bus the 
other night and found out something neat. there are two pieces of alluminum, 
one on each side, that hang on the sill at the bottom of the headliner.they 
are about 5&quot; long with a small 1/4&quot; lip that is used to hang them. upon 
closer examination i can see that the lip is hand bent. sorry if this seems 
dumb to post, but i thought it was interesting to see all the time that had 
to be spent on each bus that rolled through the Westfalia lines. i also 
tried to put the rear curtain rod in my other bus and noticed that both rods 
were of different length, had the &quot;S&quot; bent in different places and the 
mounting holes on the ends were off about a 1/4&quot; from the holes on the 
tailgate.
later,
Bob Margiotti
