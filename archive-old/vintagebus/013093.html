Howdy everyone,
Just scanning thru some of the subjects on the list and read the one about 
oil and detergent additives etc.
This reminds me of a long burning question that I have meant to post before.
Does a 1600dp motor acually need to have one of those external filters as 
long as you religiously change your oil at reg. intervals.
As the motor was not originally designed to have a filter(up and above the 
little screen)I would wonder if a filter is really needed.
It does seem like a good idea but the external filters I've seen hang so low 
I would be afraid of knocking the thing off!

Thanks,Andy
