Subject: Transaxle not yet going in...

Web site work has kept me a little busier this week than I had planned... I
missed Friday :)

I likely won't start on the transaxle until Monday...  Ok, my break is over,
have to get back to work :)

I'm thinking seriously about the return drive (two weeks away) from Seattle
to Havasu I might go via Salt Lake City... of course, that depends on the
transaxle performance :)

&quot;Every day I get in the queue&quot;... &quot;I'm so nervous I just sit and smile&quot;...
&quot;We are bein' inspected have no fear&quot;... &quot;I don't want to cause no fuss, but
can I buy your magic bus&quot;.... &quot;I don't care how much I pay&quot;... &quot;I want it, I
want it, I want it&quot;... &quot;Cause I drive my baby every way&quot;... &quot;Now I drive my
Magic Bus&quot;... &quot;I drive my baby every way, each time I go a different way&quot;
... &quot;I want it&quot;... &quot;Every day you'll see the dust, I drive my baby in my
Magic Bus&quot;...
