Subject: re: [VB] Sighting - 21 window on NBC news!

The bus was located on Coronado Island, CA. Was a story of fellow &quot;guests&quot; with
ARIZONA State Senator, John McCain at the Hanoi Hilton. 

Authors of a newish book documented at least three gentleman and their lives
after VietNam. The show of photos associated with the book are currently being
shown in a gallery located off-shore of Los Angeles-Long Beach California, on
Coronado Island.

Yes, from an estimated 50-100 feet it appeared to be better than a 50 footer.
Nice story as well.
Fly your flag and thank a Vet.
