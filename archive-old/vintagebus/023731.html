I can speak only on my past experience with SOTO. I joined specifically
(circa '92) to obtain a good splitty, and I did, even though I was
ignorant of many things, like fiberglassed panels and the like...
	In fact, if you'll look in the March '92 issue of the newsletter,
you'll see the ad for the bus that I bought, advertised as a &quot;1965
Westfalia Camper, with tent. 47K, all original except motor... blah and
so on...&quot; It was not a Westy.. but some kind of EZ Camper hybrid
thing... but I bought it and learned a lot.
	But... I used to think SOTO was OK... and I'm sorry that it has sunk to
mediocrity or less. I was thinking about joining again, but in light of
the recent posts, I'll wait until it gets better. I may even scrape off
those SOTO stickers... dunno.
