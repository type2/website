&gt; I have a 1956 Standard with some 1955 parts, what might be referred to as a
&gt; late model 1955.  Sorry no barn door.  I am trying to find a good driver
&gt; side door for the bus, however don't know what spanning years that my door
&gt; covers.  In other words is it a 50-55 door, a 56-62 door or a 62-69 etc...
&gt; Below are a couple of links to pictures of the door handle, the defining
&gt; factor.  Any help would be appreciated, so I can communicate correctly and
&gt; find a new driver side door -- BTW the handles pictured are passenger side.
&gt; Also, if there is a trade name for the door, like scallop handle, etc...
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in Advance.

Hi Wayne,
That looks like the 1955-62ish, 1962ish through the first three or four 
months of 1964 model year had a slight retangle recess around the door handle 
base, then the later 1964-67 doors had the push button and restaining strap 
on the front edge.

That appears to be your main business webpage!
