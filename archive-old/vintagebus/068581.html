Subject: I'm excited

I just got off the phone to england to creative engineering, my new 
popouts and safari kit will be on it's way shortly.  Mix that in with a 
4 digit order from busdepot and wolfsburg west and you have a full resto 
coming up.  I will post photos of the restoration before and after when 
I begin in about 1.5 months.  On the agenda, stripping the bus down, a 
new paint job (Pearl white on metallic grey), all new rubber, all new 
interior (grey/mesh grey), and hundreds of other little things like a 
sound deadening mat, new emblem, new floor mats and rear carpet.  My 
transmission is next to new thanks to Berry (and JP) in Alb. NM, my 
engine has about 40000 on it, but I still will be working on some little 
mechanical problems (like rebuilding the shifter).  My fatigue is 
setting in, it's 3:21am and I'm being summoned to bed, what sweet dreams 
I will have tonight.

but good news tonight.
