I now know it is possible to have to many busses.  Maybe I am crazy...  I
need the parking spot so I am getting rid of my first bus.  It is a sad day
but it needs to be done.  It has sat untouched for too long.  It was last
licensed in 94'.

It is a 67' walkthrough kombi.  Stripped (not paint, just parts) in
preparation for paint, what you see is what you get.   It would be great for
someone who has a parts bus.  It has very little rust.  There are a couple
of small rust holes in the rocker under the cargo doors.  There is also a
little surface rust around the replaced nose skin.  The nose skin was
replace a few years back by John Kelly at http://www.ghiaspecialties_dot_com/.
He does really nice work, all the nose needs is a little grinding to be
perfect.  I would like to get $1000 for it.  If I still have it next week it
will go on ebay.  There are pictures available at
http://yeagerworks_dot_com/67bus/index.html.
