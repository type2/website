&gt; would like to install a fuel shut-off valve of some sort at the tank to make
&gt; future engine pulls more enjoyable. I also will be removing that little
&gt; plastic fuel filter that is inline between the fuel pump and carb and
&gt; relocating it somewhere outside the engineroom. A fuel shut-off valve will
&gt; be helpful for those frequent filter changes (not to mention a handy theft
&gt; prevention device)
&gt; 
&gt; Any recomendtions as to where to buy one or a specific kind that has worked
&gt; for you?

I use a Gas (not gasoline but natural gas) line shut off valve, brass and
the smallest size, I have the &quot;ball cock&quot; type and it works exactly the
way you want.  I too got tired of the &quot;gas bath&quot; everytime I changed  my
gas filter.

found it at a LARGE, wholesale plumbing supply house,  checked for someone
else they didn't have em at &quot;Home Depot&quot;  (General Plumbing Supply,
Baltimore MD)
