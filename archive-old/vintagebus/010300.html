Everett and All;

You've seen my post about defective oil pressure switches.  I was referring
only to the _functional_ defects.

I didn't mention all the brand new oil pressure switches that leaked THROUGH
the switch.  With these mutant pieces of trash the threads seal just fine in
the case, but the oil seeps [sometimes even squirts] out of the innards of
the switch.

This defect seems almost epidemic lately, and is not unique to a particular
brand of switch.  A number of local shops and FLAPS have been cursed with
this problem, and the jury is still out on a source of reliably functional,
non-leaking, oil pressure switches.
