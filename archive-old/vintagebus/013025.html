Hey, I have carried a spare engine more than once.  The first time I travelled cross country I threw one in my double cab.  All I used off of it was the oil pressure sender.  They  next time I made the same trip I ended up having to rebuild my engine in Austin, Texas in a parking lot.  The engine was real new when I left home so I wasn't worried about it, but that was before I learned about compression ratio and melting pistons.  Do you know what they charge for parts and machine work in Austin?  Took me 3 or 4 days on public transportation and lots and lots of cash to get back on the road.  The next 3 week journey I went on I brought a spare engine and no problems.  It is like having all the spare parts you might need in one little bundle.  Plus, if you find a bus you want to buy it is easier than renting a trailer.  The only time I have had to use the spare engine was when I was bringing it to Texas to pick up a bus I was buying.  The engine above (that was rebuilt in Austin!
 and still had too high of a CR... OK for in town but no freeway driving) went out 50 miles into the 400 mile trip to Texas.  Swapped the spare in in less than 20 minutes and were on the road.  We changed engines more than we changed our socks that trip.  Ended up leaving my bus in Texas to pick up later and drove the new one home with the one good engine.  But that is another story.

Murphy's law says if you bring the part you won't need it.  The more you bring the less you fix.

I'm curious if there are any others that might carry even more stuff than
you!  Perhaps a spare steering column, or spare motor, front beam,
complete transaxle or front hood and bumper maybe.
later :)
