&gt; With an oven, you can &quot;bake&quot; parts that you've just painted,
&gt; like steering wheels and other small stuff.  Kinda like
&gt; redneck powder coating.

Take care with this!  If the paint is wet and you put it into a gas oven,
don't be surprised if the solvent catches fire or even explodes!

I let parts air-dry, and then give them a bake in the oven.  Seems to make
the paint a lot more durable.
