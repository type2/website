Subject: Re: [VB] more oil questions

&gt;So what viscosity oil do most of you guys use in your VWs?  I have been
&gt;using 30w for so long that I never gave it much thought.  I know that it
&gt;turns to sludge in cold weather but I dont drive my old VWs much in winter
&gt;so it never was much of an issue.  I always figured I could run 20w50 in
&gt;summer and 10w40 in winter but i never had any issues so I never bothered to
&gt;change weights.  All my engines are well broken in single ports, so if i had
&gt;something a bit more modern i might pay a bit more attention to it.


I run Mobil 1 15w50 in everything, year-round.  I try to change it at least
every 3000 miles, but if I miss that mark I'm covered.

It's tough to find, but there is also Mobil 1 gear lube (GL-5 only), ATF,
and grease, as well as other weights of motor oil, one with w ZERO
viscosity number (for Antarctica?).
