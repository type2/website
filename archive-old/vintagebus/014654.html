&gt; We used to have at least one MB diesel car towed into the dealership

&gt; 18-19 gallons of gas and a gallon of diesel. I had a Fiat 128SL that
&gt; I would
&gt; put this 'dieseline' in. Most of the time the car ran ok except: very
&gt; hard
&gt; to start cold, no acceleration cold, and smoke.

In the late '70s, Gasohol was the big thing, so a local station in
Tucson (Herbst?) decided that they would mix 10% diesel with the
gasoline.  They got away with it for a few weeks, since they clearly
labeled what you were buying, but pretty soon the state made them stop.
 I don't know if there was any ill effects from the diesel mix, but we
tested the octane (I was in engr. school at the time and had access to
the test engine) and found it to be in the 80 RON range.  Not good
stuff!
