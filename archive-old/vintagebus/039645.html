Hey y'all
Been a while since I posted, been busy with the commute to/from NC and work 
and stuff.  As you may recall, I had blown 3 oil filters with the colder 
weather arriving.  Seems that's not all I did with the wonderfully high oil 
pressure I had been experiencing.  My clutch started slipping.  Saw some oil 
seepage from the engine/tranny union.  I won't list the litany of 'less than 
polite' words I was using.

Managed to scarf a couple days off during the week trading 48 hours of work 
over a 3 day period for the time off.  Wednesday late morning pull the oil 
plug to drain the oil.  Engine pull was routine, doublecheck to ensure I 
didn't leave heaterbox cables hooked up or something dumb like that.  Tin 
stripped, oil lines off, ready to retorque the heads.  Seems though that I 
need a torque wrench to perform the task.

Mine's safe, sound, warm, and dry in my tool box in North Carolina.  Short 
litany of words and a phone call to Royce who drops his off later.  While 
waiting for torque wrench, why not pull the clutch and pressure plate.  Sure 
enough, the outer 1.25&quot; of clutch on the flywheel side was oil soaked.  No 
wonder she slipped huh?  Only way to check where the oil comes from is to 
pull the flywheel.  Guess what?  That's right, big ass pipe is hanging out 
with my torque wrench.  Royce drops off his torque wrench and it's 1/2&quot; 
drive.  My adapter's (that's right) making sure my torque wrench and big ass 
pipe don't do anything funny in my absence.

Do other stuff until Snoopy gets home and ask him to run me over to the 
hardway store for supplies.  He gets home after dark and I have this thing 
against wrenching in the comfy bed of pine needles in the dark.  He promises 
to help me break the nut loose in the morning.

Up next day before daylight, skid the engine out from under the bus, apply 
newly aquired big ass pipe to breaker bar and socket, gland nut pops free 
smooth as buttah.  Go inside, brew a pot of chunky and wait for the sun to 
warm things up some.  Sun warms the day, out I go to wrench.  The flywheel 
pops off, cam plug wasn't leaking (whew!)  replace main seal, endplay check, 
retorque flywheel.  Install and torque clutch assembly after cleaning 
flywheel and pressure plate.

Retorque heads goes well.  I noticed some head stud to rocker contace 
action, easily fixed with a file and some patience.  That might be why #4 
exhaust always seemed noisy.  install and torque rockers, set valves, no 
sense keeping track of what was of after rocker removal but she still seemed 
consistent with the usual loose/tight pattern she's shown for 16+k miles 
over the last 8 months.  Replace tinware (still beating the rear tin on 
Andy).  Go inside, brew a pot of extra chunky, take a break before the next 
step.

Single handed install, my adapted floor jack making sure my torque wrench, 
big ass pipe, and adapter don't run off and have adventures.  Used 2 floor 
jacks, a 4x4 and a bunch of little bits of wood to shim the engine up into 
place.  It worked, though it takes much patience and I don't recommend 
dropping your engine on the ground as many times as I did (2).  Matter of 
fact, I don't recommend it at all.  It slid in nice as anything, probably 
because I had to keep checking alignment and shimming and sliding and 
checking and lining and shimming get the idea yet?  Replace oil lines, all 
rubber fuel lines bolt everything back in.  She gave horrendous backfires 
when I tried to fire her up.  Sure enough, I had reversed #3&amp;4 plug wires.  
Then she fired right up, built oil pressure, and generally did as a well 
behaved bus should do.

Clean up stuff, check the oil again, get cleaned up.  Off to meet with some 
fine folks.  Darnit, I forgot to adjust the clutch after the install.  I 
seem to always forget this step, but as long as that's all I forget that's 
an easy fix.

I switched to Castrol Syntec to see if it makes a difference.  Friday after 
work we made the run home to NC, she ran quieter, probably because head 
studs no longer contact rockers.  the Syntec doesn;t seem to build as high 
an oil pressure on startup and seems to maintain pressure better.  She also 
ran 25 - 30 degrees cooler.  She ran rough because of a carb inbalance, 
seems I bent the carb linkage during this ordeal, bent it back into shape 
before I came back down, much smoother.  Put the carb stix on it later this 
week and balance them properly.  In all a sucessful wrench session.  And to 
think people astually get paid to do this!
