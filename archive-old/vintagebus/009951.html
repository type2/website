Why drive all the West to Portland on the freeway before turning south on
I-5 if you're heading for S. California?

&gt;Well,
&gt;
&gt;I leave tomorrow at noon to fly up to Pasco WA (Eastern) and retrieve my
new(to me) 67 W/T H/T Westy courtesy some frequent flyer miles.  A friend of
mine will help me tow it back from ID where it's sat for the last 15 years
or so.  We'll bring it back to his house in Umitilla where will throw a
motor in it and fix what needs fixing.  Then I'll drive it on back home.
Should be a nice little adventure since I driven all of 10 miles in any
split bus and I live in Southern CA.
&gt;
&gt;I'm taking all the spares I can as well as a print out of the AIRS
directory of helpful nice people.
&gt;
&gt;Does anyone know of a VW place in Pendelton OR.  I heard there was a good
one there.  Just incase we need any odd ball parts that I'm not bringing
with me.
&gt;
&gt;I'm heading out Sunday or Monday from Umitilla/Hermeston West along the
Columbia (Craig, what side of the river are you on?) ...South at Portland
along the 5. I think I'll need a place to stop somewhere in Central to
Southern OR, &amp; possibly Central CA.  Anyone have a driveway I can park in
for the night?
