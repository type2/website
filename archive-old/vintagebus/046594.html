&lt;&lt;  Anyone know how long in inches the tube should be? &gt;&gt;
Hi Steve,
We took a look at our bus and bug official VW part books and can not find any 
changes listed in length.  Which is odd if there were any since all the 
cables are listed by length and the even the flexable bus accelerator cable 
tube that goes along the tranny has lengths listed.  Are you sure the forward 
end of your clutch boden tube is properly slipped over the metal tube from 
the body?  Also make sure that the metal clutch tube on the body has not 
broken loose from it's welds.  The one on our 1960 panel camper had and was 
causing us length problems.  If so remove the clutch cable and weld it 
securely!  Eric&amp;Barb
