#1 reason NOT to run an unknown engine that has been sitting

 Was stripping my 25hp that came out of my barndoor the other day and when I
removed the fan shroud, I found this:

Some kind of rodent had crawled in thru the shroud, thru the fan, and made a
packed nest on Cylinders 1 and 2, composing of shredded newspaper and
cardboard. Note the round acorn shells with the center eaten out. The tin is
filled up with the stuff. If I woulda started the motor before disassembly,
It definitely would've overheated- possibly crackin the block/heads or maybe
even a fire or at least lots of smoke. Anybody ever tried to put out a fire
that was burnin *inside* the shroud? Too bad the fan belt was connected, the
squirrel coulda used the fan like a hamster wheel for exercise... or at
least charged the battery.
