Subject: [VB] engine stops funny
Message-ID: &lt;19991209222711.3525.qmail_at_awcst094_dot_netaddress_dot_usa_dot_net&gt;

yesterday when I turned the car off, and pulled the keys out, the engine kept
running for about 5 or ten seconds, sounding really sick...later I started it
up, drove around stopped, problem gone. So I thought it was just some weird
anomaly...But it happened again today, but just once(ie the next two times i
started and stopped the engine no problem)

Any ideas...I did recently purchase gas at a different dealer than the one I
usually choose. I regularly get it from diamond shamrock, which is basically
non-national brand/convenience store type. I always get the highest grade.
This last time I bought it at Chevron, again highest grade, their gas has
techron in it. I have used techron in my engine before without any
problems(added it directly to the gas i usually buy)

Any ideas....
