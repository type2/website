Subject: Dual-circuit conversion questions
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.LNX.4.10.10007312151050.1114-100000_at_birdbird&gt;

Hello all!

I have a couple of questions about the dual-circuit master
cylinder conversion.  I've read Eric&amp;Barb's article on it
in the library at type2_dot_com.  I've also crawled under my
'64, removed the pan, and inspected the stock single-circuit
brake setup.

I think I understand what they're talking about for a spacer to
make the pushrod easier to adjust.  Does anyone sell this
piece as a ready-made part?  How about just cutting the mounting
flange off a junk (or cheap non-original repop) master cylinder
and using that as a spacer...?

Some of the original brake line is kinda rusty on the outside,
so who knows what it looks like on the inside.  WW and probably
other vendors sell a &quot;brake line kit&quot; of all the steel lines
on the car.  I think I'll use almost all of the lines in the
kit, even after the conversion - is this true?  Or would I be
better off buying individual steel lines?  (I already plan to
replace all the flex lines.)

Finally, will the dual-circuit MC still be appropriate if I
swap to disks later?  I know this is a lot more work and involves
more parts changes, but if I can upgrade to dual-circuit now
and leave an easy upgrade path to discs later I want to do that.

Thanks very much!!
