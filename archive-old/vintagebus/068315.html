&gt; That's what I figure. He can't balance them though - doesn't have the
&gt; thingee to do it. Nor does he have the on-the-car balancer either.

Sounds like it's time to buy a spare front brake drum!  Mount it on the

As a SoCal resident, I don't get much chance to drive in rain.  The times

those conditions, though!
