 Looks like I finally am going to get the VW I have been wanting for a long
time - a nice splitty crew cab.  To make room in the driveway and bank account
I'll be selling my '67 Bus.  It is a Kombi with very very little rust - solid
rockers and front floors.  Some rust starting in backs of the front wheel
wells but otherwise very solid, really!  It has tight steering and runs and
drives well.  Larger than stock engine, don't know exactly what size but it is
very strong.  Bus even has the original middle seat which is in good shape.
Front and rear seat have been recovered.  Looks good and runs good as is.
Delivery to Colorado Spring/Denver during the shows next week is possible.
Currently located just outside of Kansas City.  $3,200 or best reasonable
offer.  Email pictures available.  Write or call for more details.
