Subject: Strange fuel...

This is by way of a &quot;heads up&quot;, at least for folks in the US Pacific
Northwest.

Last week I was in need of fuel, and because I was near a Chevron station
which I'd used a lot up until 2 years ago I ducked in to fill up with
unleaded regular.  Since then I've been doing a large number of shortish
trips around town and the suburbs, with the odd 5 or 10 mile run on a
freeway.

Starting Monday evening I was increasingly aware of a brief rattle from the
engine when starting from rest, and also increasing roughness and overall
engine noise.  By Wednesday evening the rattle at start up was getting
really annoying, and the engine was running rough and unusually warm.

Late Wednesday evening I returned to the Chevron station and refilled the
tank with ~12 gallons of premium fuel.  In over 20 years of running stock
1600SP powered buses this was the first time I'd ever bought anything other
than regular grade fuel.  Within 15 miles the engine was back to normal,
with no pinging/pre-ignition and running smoothly and much cooler.

I've certainly had my share of &quot;bad gas&quot; from various brands and locations,
but nothing like this situation.  There was no change in ignition timing or
anything else on the engine.  All indications are that the Chevron regular
unleaded was way below specs for octane, etc..  This is a very high volume
station, so it wasn't a matter of old/stale/contaminated fuel from overly
long retention in the bulk tanks on site.

While I was running the stuff I was lightly loaded, with just driver and one
passenger.  Around town we had the windows down, so I could hear the
pinging.  If I had filled up with this fuel and hit the freeway for an
extended journey, with our typical load of 3 people and a ton of camping
gear, I expect the damage done by pre-ignition and overheating would have
been irreversible.

Let the buyer beware, etc., etc., etc......
