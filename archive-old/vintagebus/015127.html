thom,
i would go with a solid color... and i liked the bright yellow with a hugh 
BOSCH logo idea. i did have another idea though... i have some 6&quot; Hella's on 
my SO's Fox and i always thought the design on the round covers would be 
cool for the side of a panel. let me know i'll scan it for ya.
