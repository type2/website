Subject: Re: [VB] Re: survey: testing cooling etc [VB] was side scoops

Wow! That's pretty much what I invented back in 95! I used four 'hooks'
per scoop welded to machine screws that came out to where the scoop would
fasten to them, holding it against the body, with a layer of soft
closed-cell neoprene as a sealer/protector. Wierd thing is that I never
used them, and gave them away to a listee several years ago, out in San
Fran. Had the scoops custom made, and painted during the restoration.

&gt; I have a scoop that doesn't require any holes to be drilled.
&gt; It has two flat metal hooks that hook into the vent slots, two screws go
&gt; through the vent and hold it tight against the side of the van. Just some
&gt; simple southern engineering and some weather strip and you got vents that
&gt; leave no trail if you remove them.
&gt; Pictures if you want.
