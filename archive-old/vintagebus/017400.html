The standard price range seems to be anywhere from $1 for a beat-up one,
to $10 for nice ones.  I've seen them higher on ebay.  There are plastic
brazilian ones that can be had for $10 or so at the local VW Flaps, which
include the lense.  Lenses are $5 - $15, depending on which one you get,
ie taiwan repop, OG, etc.
