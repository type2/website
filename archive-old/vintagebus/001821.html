Hi,

Such a timely post. A gentleman from Pacific Soda Blast stopped by my
house on Tuesday with such a unit. Rents it for $200 per day. It is
hard to imagine what he was renting. Your description tells me that
maybe I don't want to do this. How many hours did it take to do your
bus?

I thought that if I did it, maybe there would be someone else in the
area that wants to do their bus too and would split the rental fee.

Would you do it again? Is it worthwhile?

Chris in So.Cal.
