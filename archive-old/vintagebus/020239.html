Well said, Jim.  That's what I really enjoy.  Camping,
cameraderie around the campfire (Ronnie can tell you
that my fire pit has more miles on it than my busses),
the occasional parts find, and just being out on the
road away from home and meeting all the VW friends I
have and will have.

Sorry you won't be there Jim, but like a few others,
I'm going to Rich Yost's, OCTO, the campout, and
skipping the Classic (spending time with my Dad
instead).  Look forward to meeting unknown listees. 
I'll be really easy to find this year - look for the
singlewheel trailer that almost matches the Turquoise
Sub-hatch Westy!
