I still envy you!   even if you do get pounded on for not saying it quite
right! hahaha!
hey,,, what is a good way to say that !  It is a tough one!

If My Wife wasn't  having fun in the sun, Florida,, while I have to work in
the cold,,waa waaaa..Canada..  I would have copied your IDEA and made it
look like *I* thought it up!!!!

Way to go!
I have to say it again!!    What a GREAT Idea!!
