well,

as far as busses being unsafe goes... it doesnt bother me a bit.

I was into motorcycling and decided to give it up.  I picked VW busses as
a replacement hobby....

i doubt even tom and ray would say that i have gone to a more unsafe
vehicle...

besides, life is more fun if you live on the edge a bit.

the &quot;no airbag in my future ever&quot; man,

Steve
