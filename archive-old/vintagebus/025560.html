Subject: Mexican engine question, anyone dealt with this?
Message-ID: &lt;376EF4DB.F3E1CF60_at_gateway_dot_net&gt;

hi group!

upon installing my new Beetlemex engine, i found it to be running hot. 
after spending quite a while trying to find what was making it run hot
(250 degrees), i finally head about there being a problem with the new
mexican engine cases, namely, the oil galley to the cooler not being
drilled out all the way (if at all) sometimes.

anyone dealt with this before?  how did you fix it?

right now i am looking at sending it back in  under warranty, but was
wondering if there was a quicker way to fix it.

thanks all,

Eric
P.S.  it is a gradual heatup that takes about 20-30 (depending if i am
trying to cruise the freeway, or bee-boping along the side streets)
minutes to get up to that high.  everything for the cooling is in place
and working.  (timing, carburetion, engine seals, flaps, you name it,
ive checked it.  unfortunatly)  :(
