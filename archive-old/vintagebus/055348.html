Thanks for all the replies once again.

I had the flywheel resurfaced today and sent it, the pressure plate, the
pistons and the pulley to visit the crankshaft and rods at the machine shop.
They will balance the whole assembly for 75 smackers, and from the replies I
received, that sounds like money well spent.

Mad Uncle Dave is bringing up a Plexiglas piece in the morning to cc the
thing when I get that far. Since I work all the time, this will push back my
finish dates a couple of weeks, but better to it right the first time!

Thanks guys, I am learning a lot.

BTW, our bus is in VW trends this month (Nov 2001). Page 39 the white one
with our dog in the background!

&gt; &gt; Jake, Doc, list:
&gt; &gt; Doc Ric really had 2 questions here, compression ratio being the main
one.
&gt; &gt; What is really important is that the c/r not be set too high. Opinion
&gt; varies and
&gt; &gt; expected gasoline quality would determine this (though recent drive
&gt; reports from
&gt; &gt; Mexico indicate this is less of a problem than it used to be).
&gt; &gt; The maximum c/r would be somewhere in the 7.5/1 area and if you are
close,
&gt; &gt; better make sure you are accurate. Many would prefer a number more like
&gt; 6.9-7.0.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I  am of the belief that higher compression is free power, but of course
&gt; it
&gt; &gt; comes at the slight cost of shorter engine life.
&gt; &gt; A few minutes spent with your machinist and you can either have him cc
&gt; your
&gt; &gt; heads or explain how.
&gt; &gt; Second  was your statement about balancing. You really need to balance
the
&gt; rods
&gt; &gt; end for end (IOW even out all the big end weights and all the small end
&gt; weights
&gt; &gt; and then recheck the big ends). Many years ago I worked in a high
&gt; performance
&gt; &gt; machine shop and balanced many rods. They use a special rig with rollers
&gt; and a
&gt; &gt; counter balance, but I'm sure you could rig up something with knife
blades
&gt; and a
&gt; &gt; gram (dealers') scale.
&gt; &gt; Balancing the reciprocating parts (pistons and rods)  only will give you
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; best return on investment, if you are on a tight budget. I'd guess a
shop
&gt; would
&gt; &gt; do it for about $50 or so.
&gt; &gt; Higher quality pistons like Mahles and NPR's were almost always perfect
&gt; from the
&gt; &gt; factory.
