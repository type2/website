Subject: new engine questions 

Hello again,
Not sure if anyone read my trip report from the Classic or not but I have a
few questions in regards to the engine I built.

The engine is a 1600dp, doghouse cooling, 040 heads, 009 at 32 deg max
advance, 34-3, C/R is set at 7.25:1.
I had about 120 miles on the engine before the trip. I did not have a chance
to re-torque the heads down prior.
The engine had great power and ran very cool.
The problem is oil consumption. Through the whole trip I had to add about 3/4
quart over the 800 miles we drove in three days.
Is that normal with that low miles?
Are the rings still seating?
Etc....
Hopefully someone else has gone through this and has the answers for me.
Just some additional background on the engine. I did have oil pressure
problems during break in that I didn't realize until after.
Could that have resulted in my oil consumption problems.

Thanks in advance.
