A side effect of the summertime camping and traveling season is fewer posts.
Even less on weekend as though with their heads screwed on straight are
taking care of priorities such as family, house repairs, etc.  A lot of us
subscribe from work too and have to wait until the weekday to see what's
going on.  I almost wished it was that way for me.  I'd get more done on the
weekends.  Anyway, as fall and winter approach, you'll notice more activity.
I've seen this every year for 4 or so years now.  Absolutely normal.

BTW:  I have posting fewer posts as well, not planning an official return to
the list until sometime mid-July.  That will be the 3 months since Mark
Ahlbright accused me of posting ads to further my ego trip.  I have yet to
see him post once to the list with some helpful info since that time.
