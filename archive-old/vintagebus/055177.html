Subject: Dead Horse revived, wheres that hole??

Thanks for all the advice I received about timing and other issues with my .009 and 34pict3 set up. I advanced my timing to about 10 BTDC at idle and i see a definite inmprovement. However this procedure brought up one BIG question.  What\Where is this hole in the throttle plate on the carb that I am supposed to plug up.  I have looked my carb up and down, and the only pluggable holes I find are the little &quot;pipes&quot; where the vacuum hoses would go on a vac set up (already plugge with a peice of hose with a screw in the end). So would someone very SPECIFICALLY describe where this hole in the throttle plate is located??
