I've been quietly lurking, trying to get a feel for the list's
attitude on ebay.  I have my own ideas, with some may agree
and others may not, but that's immaterial now.

The type2 list banned ebay discussion altogether.  I don't
want to go that far, as ebay is still an important source
for parts and accessories, and it's also educational, as sometimes
new bits come up for sale that people haven't seen before, and
the resulting discussion is helpful.  An example of this would
be the double-generator stand.  In addition, it's helpful for
new people to learn about the pitfalls of the ebay system,
and the list is a good soapbox for voicing concerns.

So, I've decided that there will be two tenements to the ebay policy:

article 1: discussions of ebay as a means of buying and selling
goods, with regards to practices, complaints, praises, and
whatnot, will be banished to Fridays, where they will live
side by side with the hippies and movie sitings.  The same
applies to advertising auctions that you're running.

article 2: discussion about buses, parts or accessories which
are for sale on ebay is OK, as long as the context of the discussion
is about the physical goods, and not the sales mechanism.  
In fact, a compliant post could probably wouldn't even mention the
fact that said gizmo was on ebay.

These rules apply to any other commerical sales venues, be
it an online auction (ebay, yahoo), live auction (ie Barrett-Jackson, Sotheby's),
classifieds, etc.

Attacks on other groups or individuals have never been acceptable.
Some of the posts regarding the ebay issues were seriously out of line -
please be more civil in the future.

I'll be updating the list charter appropriately when I get a chance.
Irrespective of when I get around to actually updating the charter, the
policy goes into effect today.  If this compromise doesn't work, then
I'll have to move to blocking ebay discussion altogether.

Thanks.

Thom
