Yup, turning also helps keep the supply chain moving. Why with a combination
of metallic brake shoes carving away and frequent turnings, we can use
enough brake drums to make sure they remain available. I still am amazed
that accelerating the removal of material from the drums is considered to be
a benefit. It defies logic. I have been known to get in there and scratch
them up with some good 40 grit sandpaper if they start squeaking, but I'll
just let the material wear away as it is intended otherwise, thank you.
Lifetime pads are warrantied, but the drums they are eating up aren't. Keep
your brakes in top shape, keep them adjusted, never run them till they
groove the drums and keep your money in your pocket. I would stack the
brakes on my vehicles up against anybodies, but it ain't because I turn
them. It is because I maintain them and use them consciously.

&gt;     of course, if you are using organic pads in the place of OE
semi-metallics,
&gt; you'll likely have problems with brake fade... probably also if you are
one of
&gt; those people that does not have drums and discs turned at reline time.
this
&gt; helps to restore the coefficient of friction when done properly.
