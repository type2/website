Subject: window woes


 &gt;So. does anyone out there have a replacement passenger side window? id
 &gt;rather not pay the 160+ for the set. Im on a tight budget as I am moving
 &gt;in under a month, and it seems every time I try to fix something I find
 &gt;something else wrong.

Clyde,
I got a hold of a shop here in Fresno, CA that will cut a front windshield
from .110&quot; laminated glass for $42.50 plus tax, tracing my cracked
one. Hopefully they'll give me a break, no pun intended, when I buy 3.
Some of the usual VW suppliers quote $38 or so plus shipping. If you want
my old one, you can have it for shipping cost. It's only cracked on the
inside!
Why are there 500 mobile glass companies in the yellow pages that can't
supply a low-tech piece of glass? &quot;We don't cut glass&quot;. Sheesh.
