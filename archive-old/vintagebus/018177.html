Go to my accessories page: http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/gallery/acc.html
and cruise thru there for pix of the westy version.  There's also
a ZVW version, which is simpler in design, but unfortunately I don't
have pix.

&gt; sale? I'm in the metal trades so if I had an idea of how they are built I
&gt; could fabricate my own. Thanks for all the help people!
