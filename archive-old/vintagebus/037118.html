Check your carburetor!  Make sure it isn't all gunked up.

I'll second that.  sounds like the idle circuit could be clogged.  Not
surprised if it sat all winter.   I pulled my 61 (safari windows) out of the
carport not too long ago and have put about 300 miles on it and I thought
there was a funky carb thing going on and pouredsome fuel system treatment
gunk swill of nasty chemicals into the tank and filled it a hundred miles ago
and durned if it don't run smoother.   I wondered about that stuff but I tried
it on my bug first a little while before and it shour sounds smoother and got
better milage too and it fixed that 'takes a while to catch and start problem'
and  gas is all a nasty swill of chemicals too god only knows what they put in
that stuff and I'm not all that big on cleaning carbs with those nasty fumes
and all even though I have the milkthistleseed tincture what is good for the
liver and boosts my tolerance of fumes but I guess you gotta take it apart and
clean it if your idle circuit is clogged.  Squirt out all the passages.
