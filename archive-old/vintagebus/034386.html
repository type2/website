Subject: RE: Too rusty?? 65 deluxe
Date: Mon, 19 Oct 1998 12:19:36 +1000



	&gt; How does one determine if a bus is unsavable? Saw a 65 deluxe
today, but baby
	&gt; is she rough. I know replacements are available for the lower
parts, but the
	&gt; roof from rain gutters up about 5 inches is crusty rusty. What is
the rule of
	&gt; thumb, if there is one? Of course, non running 1600 DP out of a
bug in place.
	&gt; Last driven many moons ago - looks like several years. 

	Roof rust is more difficult to repair 'properly' (remove rust and
replace metal)
	than chassis related rust (outriggers, rocker panels etc).
Replacement
	sections are not available commercially and are difficult to make
'by hand'.

	However, the delimiter (I think) is whether the rust has moved 'up'
from
	the rain gutter or has moved 'down' and has gotten into the
U-section that
	the roof sits on (have a look you'll see what I mean) and 'lower'.

	If the rust has moved up and the U section is largely OK, then you
can
	save the bus (although its a lot of work). You can drill/grind the
spot welds that
	hold the whole roof onto the U section and around the overhead vent
	and replace the whole thing.....

	If rust is well into the U section - well..........
