Hi Jon,
We have been in the same boat.  If you already have the later front beam, and 
it's 20% bigger brakes then go to the later reductions, and brakes in the 
rear.  The brakes by themselfs are worth it just to be able to stop so much 
easier even with a good load on board.  Made all the differance with our 
panel even when empty of cargo wether it was stoppable on steep Seattle 
downhills when a stop light would change unexpectantly.  The later reduction 
bearings do require more tools, and preperation, but are longer lasting due 
to the outer roller bearing, and take heavier loads better.  Lastly the later 
reduction boxes (Unless you get a set of mountian geared ones.) are higher 
geared so you can do the MPH faster at the same RPM or the same MPH at a 
lower RPM.   Eric&amp;Barb
