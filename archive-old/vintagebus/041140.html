Hey thanks everybody for coming to my aid like that. Special thanks to
Steve for the photos of exactly the part I needed to see. That is just
brilliant. The one I made is similar but a little simpler (custom
sano?) and looks like it will do the job. If it doesn't I think can
copy the one in the photos pretty accurately.
So I didn't get the engine back in, I still want to take a good long
look at the tranny mounts and starter, but I am calling bus weekend a
victory nonetheless. Thermostat! Hoover bit! Oil bath! All good stuff,
I hope you will agree.
Next battle will be making the fresh air hoses from the fan to the
heat exchangers work around the octopus-like extractor exhaust I can't
afford to get rid of yet. But I must have heat.
VW had their cheap moments, but some of this aftermarket stuff... When
the paint finally finishes burning off the exhaust, I won't be
surprised to find it is chrome underneath. I had to pay more for a
spare generator pulley that wasn't chromed. The air cleaner I'm
ditching for the oilbath? Nice piece of chrome there. But they sure
sell the stuff at low low prices, so you can't say you aren't warned.
The new cars are a different matter, don't they cost a bundle! I went
for a ride in a friend's new beetle. How long do you give that dash
under a southwestern sun? Where are the classic cars of 40 years from
now? I think we have them. I hope to have mine back on the road
tomorrow.
tomorrow.
