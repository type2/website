I used one of the 36 mm axle sockets its shaped like a fish about 6 inches
long
i pounded the crap out of it after heating it up and finally screech they
both came off within a matter of minutes

before this I tried for two days to get them off using pipe wrenches with
several foot cheeter pipes and then snaping a brand new craftsman breaker
bar 20 minutes after the wife bought it for 30 dollars i tried every thing
with no luck at all and then I bought this 8.99 device
and it was the best way and the easiest sweat free way to accompish removing
the nut with 275 foot pounds of torque.  So how do you go about retorquing
the darn thing to 275
short of beating it back on until the holes line up ?  any one else have a
better way ??

&gt;&lt;&lt; after sweeping up.  I blocked the bus, got the rear end on jack stands,
&gt;took
&gt; off the rear tires and proceeded to have one helluva time getting the axle
&gt; nuts loose.  The ebrake helped some but I finally ended up using a big
piece
&gt; of c-channel with a hole drilled in it.  I bolted it to the drum.  Next
came
&gt; the torch, the quenching in WD40 with thick white smoke, and then me with
&gt; with big Bertha (5' cheater), socket, and sliding t-handle in 3/4 drive.
I
&gt; put my 300 pound mass on the end of the 5 foot cheater and that axle nut
&gt; would not budge!  My first attempts with the tire on resulted in the tire
&gt; simply spinning on the cement floor.  Somewhere in all of this a pipe
wrench
&gt; sailed over my head and traveled about 10 feet - hitting the shop door and
&gt; scaring my grandfather.  This time,  I got a beefier but shorter cheater,
&gt; used the floor jack to support the socket, and went at it.  I jumped so
hard
&gt; on that pipe while grabbing the drip gutter with my finger tips that I
&gt; thought I was going to break the t-handle.  My grandfather just said, &quot;I
&gt; don't care - if it breaks, I'll just get another one.&quot;
&gt;  &gt;&gt;
&gt;eek!-   you removed the axle nuts with the wheels OFF the ground!  Scary.
I
&gt;would always do that with wheel on the bus, on the ground, ebrake on and if
&gt;lack of ebrake makes it neccessary, neccessay blocks.
&gt;
&gt;I too have the 3/4 drive socket and have a slide bar and six foot pipe.
not
&gt;been beat by one yet.  Done that jump up and down on the pipe while
balancing
&gt;on the drip rail thang.   BUT
&gt;
&gt;do grease up the threads and splines before reassembly, and realize it only
&gt;wants about 220 foot pounds to tighten, so you don't need to jump up and
down
&gt;to tighten it.
