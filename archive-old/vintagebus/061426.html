Subject: Dreaming my AZ off! - Your choice to pick...

Whoa! Like it's Friday and most email lists, right-wing talk show hosts and
clueless corporations have casual Hawiian shirt days, open mic policies or
relaxation on otherwise strict Subject: posting rules. I don't know if it's the
side effects from sniffing glue, prescription drugs or burnout on 9/11 and
Princess Di memorials but I have been dreaming my AZ off lately. I feel like
writing up one of the dreams in b-log style for the list but can't decide which
one needs done. I havent dreamt this much or this vividly since Blue Cheer, the
Chambers Brothers and Eric Burdon played at the Phoenix Coliseum.
In fiscally prudent times I can barely afford to lay on my own couch much less
paying to spend time on the one belonging to the shrink treating Howard Stern.
Choose a dream from the list below and email me your choice. The choice with
the most responses will be written up and sent to the list plus the folks in
the Bcc: distlist).

Dreams:
1. Bright lights and Duane Allman's Mansion.
2. Karmann Ghia mishap.
3. Shoe Shopping and Pink balloons.
4. What once was Gay is now only Disco. (Heather Locklear wants me but I'm
married...)
5. I used to have a career plans but ended up at Boeing.
6. Fear of the Four Horsemen, 50-something stupid votes, and oral in the oval
ruined our Country.

Let me know via private email as to which one you'd like to see posted and I'll
do it up by the next time INTC reaches '40' and Ken Lay wears Maui garb. =)
