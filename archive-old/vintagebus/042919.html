Sorry if I led anyone on, but the big score that I thought was gonna be so
great isn't as great as I thought.  Next time I'll wait till it's all in
my garage before I post anything.
I went out there today and surveyed the situation.  There's about fifteen
engines, all in different states of completeness.  Only three of them were
of any consequence.  One being a Dec. '57 long block (no fan housing,
intake, etc.).  The other two are more complete and are '58s or '59s.  One
of them is complete, right down to the old school heater boxes and 28pict
chokeless carb.  The other one is missing the carb and generator.  I have
these three engines in my posession now, so if anyone needs a complete
36er or some other 36hp parts let me know.  Believe me, I'm as bummed as
some of you are that there weren't any 25hp stuff.
