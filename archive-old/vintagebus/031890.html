batteries with the
reserve switch that supplies enough power to start the engine in case you
accidentally drain it?


Wilder,
My mechanic mentioned to me a very easy way to start a bus with a dead 
battery. Jack up one back wheel, chock the other wheels, turn the ignition 
on, put it in second gear and spin the loose rear tire by hand. He laughs at 
those who put in back up batteries or other such devices.
