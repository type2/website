Kevin,
The stuff I get made by Sta-Lube from NAPA is solely GL-4 rated.  Comes 
in a white 1 gallon jug with a turquoise-ish? label. 
As far as synthetic tranny fluid goes, the major difference that I have 
noted, is that when it is cold and you're running sythetic, it is *much* 
nicer shifting.  The synthetic stays thinner at lower temps therefore 
allowing smoother shifting.  I really don't know a whole lot else about 
it.  If you have a leaky tranny, I would stay away from it.  Just like 
with synthetic motor oil, it could get expensive, fast.  Not to mention 
buying all that kitty litter for your parking spot in the driveway :-)

&gt; i have gotten a few replies suggesting NAPA, and STA-Lube. I think I went
&gt; looking for this last year, up in boston. The STA lube stuff was GL-4 and GL-5
&gt; rated, I thought this was supposed to be bad, and I had to use stuff that was
&gt; solely gl-4 rated?
&gt; 
&gt; anyone have experience or suggestions of synthetic vs non synthetic on the
&gt; tranny fluid(not motor oil, I have heard those discussions back and forth
&gt; before)
