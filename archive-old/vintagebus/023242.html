Hey all,

Here's a little Thanksgiving treat that came to my doorstep today.  We're
sitting around the house with family when an old street rod pulls up and a
guy gets out and comes to the door.

Turns out he just sold his Bus and still has a full length roof rack
complete with brackets, etc.  His name's Anthony and he's asking $400, but
also said he'd be a little flexible on it.

Number is: (408) 301-0301

Don't email me, I haven't seen it nor do I have it.  :)
