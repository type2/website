&lt;&lt; IF there are a 12v -&gt; 6v converter installed on the bus it are mounted on
 the wire after the generator, could I then have 2 wires out of the generator
 (1 to the 6v batteri and 1 to (a new) 12v batterie) ??????? &gt;&gt;
Hi Lars,
Who knows you might even have a cold fusion devise in there.  Until you dig 
and poke into it you will never really know!  Check your generator for 
stamped markings in it's outer circumferance for wether it is 7 or 14 volt.  
Then check if the regulator has any simular markings.  Since your bus is a 67 
it should have been a 12 volt system, but who knows what has been done to it 
over the last 33 years!
