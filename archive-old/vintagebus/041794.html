&gt; For those who has the Hoover CD, there is an essay on an absolutely ingenious

&gt; its clutch and brake petal geometry, at least I THINK it's on the CD.

I searched the CD for the word &quot;thief&quot; and the word &quot;clutch&quot; and didn't
find any reference to locking or otherwise rendering the pedals
inoperative.

The CD used to be available from Bus Depot, but is no longer available.  I
don't think that any further publishing of it is planned.
