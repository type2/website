  Liz and I will be going to RMMW in August.  We'll be on our 30th wedding anniversary
 and plan on the climb up Pikes Peak as part of the celebration!  Being that our 
honeymoon was a rod run from NYC to Memphis in my chopped &amp; channeled Model 
A F*rd, this year's anniversary fits right in.
  I'm getting closer to driving the '61 Westy but I'm being held up trying to figure the 
'best' way to get the compression down to 7 to 1. For those that are interested I've started 
to put a webpage together showing it's progress from day one, when I rolled it off the trailer 
after buying it from John 'vwhoward', (for $650, he's still crying over that one!).  http://www.geocities_dot_com/vw_dragon/vw_dragon.html  Please keep in mind it's only a page 
to store some pics, I'm no web-guru.  There's a lot more to upload as time permits.  I hope 
the listees that made it to my VW home after BBB-V, appreciate what the Westy looked 
like to begin with.
  By the way, the weekend before BBB-V was cold and rainy, and this weekend there is 
snow covering the &quot;mountain&quot; and it has been raining continuously since Friday with temps
in the 40's, it just go's to show you there is a VW Bus God :^o
  ERIN WHERE&quot;S PART TWO OF YOUR TRIP HERE?  Come on, everyone is waiting q8-{)
