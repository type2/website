&lt;&lt; 1) I am an accomplished welder and some experience in bodywork but no 
experience in welding body panels, Should i leave this to a profesional or do 
it myself. Should i use Mig or oxy acetylene( I have both) can you also 
recommend wire, tips etc.&gt;&gt;
Hi Scott,
Do it yourself, I am a machinist, with no formal training in welding, and 
have done welding work that came out fine.  MIG is best, using the oxy 
acetylene for brazing results in paint bubbling in a year, or two due to flux 
damage.
 
&lt;&lt;2) What sources do you use for replacement panels,&gt;&gt;
Well so far we have used cannabilized parts so far, but you might want to 
check with Ronnie about new stuff.
 
&lt;&lt;3) do you use sandblasting for rust removal&gt;&gt;
Yes, and sandpaper, wire wheels, phosperic acid, and lots of elbow sweat.
 
&gt;&gt;4) How do you remove the old panels, Die grinders, sabre saws, nibler, 
plasma etc.&gt;&gt;
Yes, yes, yes,etc., plus chisles, hacksaw, abrasive blades in circular saw, 
even the MIG welder itself, and anything else that will cut.
 
&lt;&lt;5) Can you give me some sample repair time of lets say the front floors.  &gt;&gt;
Sorry, but that could be anything from 10 minutes, to 10 days depending on 
the damage.
Eric&amp;Barb
