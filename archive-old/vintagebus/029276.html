Subject: Turning Radius

I need to see how many turns I can get for each trip, left and right,
they are both the same....


So after all of the discussions I can see how everyone sees it as a long
turning radius, I have a PHD but I'm not good at math.... My high
schools name was Parker, so I have a Parker High Diploma :-)


Any way what do I need to look for this weekend to figure it out, Ronnie
F. suggested looking at the stops on my king pin carriers to see if some
how they are screwed out, also to check the drag link to make sure it's
not bent, since it's the same in both directions it has nothing to do
with the steering box, correct? Any thing else?

Thank YA!

Meredith
