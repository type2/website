Took Bessie, the Grateful Dead VW 67 Bus to a Weekly Friday night
get-to-gether in Phoenix--Mostly Street Rods and Original 50s and 60s
cars--So one guy is checking out Bessie and I mention that VWs can be a
little warm inside, for about 6 months of 100+ heat in Phoenix--Then he
says what you need is a swamp cooler--I said i do have one on my 62
Herbey--that fits in the window--But due to the way the windows are on a
Spliitty i have a problem--No problem says He!! I have at home, a under
dash swamp cooler that you just set on the floor and it runs off of your
12volt system--Sounds &quot;COOL&quot; i say--he then says are you interested in
it? Quotes a LOW price--I say yes--He then goes home and brings it
back--IT IS STILL IN THE BOX!!!-- NOS from the early 60s!!
Moral??--The best VW deals i have ever found have been at NON VW
events--3 weeks ago at another street rod show i picked up a 1952 VW
Factory parts book!!
It's for the type 1---but i can live with it--Drive your VW every
where--and keep looking--&quot;they&quot;--are always out there!!--  uj
