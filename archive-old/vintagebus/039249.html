OK,
	Last night I hacked out the PO's attempt at a front floor resto.
About 100 pop rivets, some weld and some wood screws and it was out. The
frame underneath looks great. There is one spot that I was wondering about
though. At the very bottom of the nose on the inner reinforcement panel
there is some rot. It only along the lower edge and does not go up into the
beam. It only has eaten away the bottom edge. Is this something that I need
to hack out and replace or can I just clean it up and POR 15 the crap out of
it? As for parts I have decided that the bare essentials I need to get this
truck back out on the road are a complete front floor section and rocker
panels. The other areas are cosmetic and will get attention as I get parts
and money. If any list member out there has, or know where I could get a
whole front floor ( dogleg to dogleg) I would greatly appreciate it. 
Thanks for reading this early morning drivel!
TJ
