&gt;   The watch has typical 60's? design. On the face, where it would say
&gt; the manufacturer's name, it says &quot;Wolfsburg&quot;. Below that it says
&gt; something about the internal movement. On the back, it has a VW logo,
&gt; with some vines and leaves? below it.

Did VW give watches away for 100,000km awards?
