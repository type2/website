&lt;&lt; &gt; Yesterday went over to Berg and picked up one of their dipstick gauges
 &gt; ...
 &gt; Anyone have any experience of this gauge vs. the VDOs I see on
 &gt; everyone's busses...
 &gt;
 Hey Steve, I use a digital meat thermometer down the dipstick hole.  It
 appears to be accurate.  I tried it on my ex-'54 Single Cab, which had an
 oil temp sump sender and VDO oil temp gauge (300F).  They read the same
 temperature.  One could argue one or both are inaccurate if one was the
 arguing type.
  &gt;&gt;
Interestingly, the VDO  oil temp guage with the VW style face dated 5/57 goes 
from 30 to 120 C. 
30C is 86F, so you can see it warm up :). 
120 C is about 250F  
That was the top of the guage made for VWs.

Clara
