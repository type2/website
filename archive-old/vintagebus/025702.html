Subject: oil filler leak 
Message-ID: &lt;378C80E4.8C2CDD56_at_santafe.cc.fl_dot_us&gt;

Hi,  I have a nasty leak at the oil filler on my '66.  Is there a gasket
in there that I might replace to fix this?  I know there is a nut about
1/2 way down.  Maybe an o-ring there?

Also, looking in parts catalogs for a view of this I saw an oil filler
base gasket and a block off plate.  What is this plate for?  Is it there
on all engines or does it have a special function for some weird
application?
Thanks
