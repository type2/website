No this isn't a post about the petri banjo steering wheel. :-)

Last night I went to my grandparent's house and Grandpa dug out his banjo.
In about an hour I was playing chords and playing stuff that my grandpa has
never played before.  I found it rather easy compared to guitar and since I
like bluegrass type music anyway (amongst other music), I was just curiouis
if anyone on the list had a 5 string banjo they don't play, can't play, and
would like to sell or trade for VW parts.  I thought I would ask because I
want to learn to play it.  I never knew a damn banjo could be so much fun!
:-)  Goes good with my overalls and corn-cob pipe really well.

Pmail me at silent_at_beatricene_dot_com

Thanks!
