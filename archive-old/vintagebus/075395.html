Tom,

If you search the list archives for 'heat' or similar, I've described in
great detail with stock numbers, etc, what and where to buy really good
materials to REALLY get that heat up front to you. I did the work back in
95 during my resto, and I've got tons of heat. It's all described several
times here on the list, under my name.
