Subject: Re: [VB] cylinder studs sealant?

I never used sealant on the studs or head nuts of a type I motor

Always use lube when putting the rods on the cranks, installing the cam, and 
lube up the pistons into the cylinders, like wipe it all over the inside of 
the cylinders.    basically lube any thing that'll turn/move.  You can buy 
'assembly lube' in a tube which seems like a thick grease to me.   I have 
also used clean grease.

Make sure everything turns round all the way before going on to the next step.

after having the engine together, fill with oil and turn by hand to get the 
oil pumped round before starting it up.
