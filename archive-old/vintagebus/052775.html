Subject: Re: [VB] 1982 Diesel VW bus stolen

This is a strange email... I am sad that someone had the unfortunate loss,, but
why is the letter aimed at Cutting up the country it was stolen from,,, 
Fine! BLAME CANADA,,, South Park guys do!  
LOL maybe I am just tooo sensitive,, or nieve.

This type of message at amplepower_dot_com/stolen has a way of becoming a Country
bashing thread,, and I think that should be killed

But...
Where are the facts?, where is the contact information ???

1982   four speed   yellow bottom with a cream top   License plate
is PWRTAP    curtains are black

and a few other fine details are on the website,,

Where are the --- If found, please report to Sometown Police Stn XX  at 505 555
1212  using occurrence number 10million-cars-stolen-in-CANADA!!

or contact the owner at phone No. ??  ,, or email blank  

Where is the vehicle serial number?  etc
 
Unfortunately the original post Email was lost so it isn't available either,,

&gt; &gt;From http://www.amplepower_dot_com/stolen/index.html
&gt; 
&gt; December 10, 2001: We're back from Vancouver, B.C.,
&gt; Canada after a long trip back on the bus. Sometime
&gt; Saturday night or early Sunday morning, the van we
&gt; took to Canada was stolen. Needless to say we're angry
&gt; and much surprised for a number of reasons.

the rest can be read at amplepower web site
