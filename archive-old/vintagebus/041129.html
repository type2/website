 The Hoosier Volks have had a camping event at a local Indiana drive-in for
 the past few years, and it's one of my favorite &quot;events&quot; of the season.The
 owners of the drive-in allow us to camp out over night and feed us coffee
 and donuts in the morning.They also advertise the event to all the locals
 who cruise the aisles looking at all the &quot;hippie buses&quot;.The following
 morning is the Hoosierfest Vw. show, which one year was held at a water
park.
 My kids favorite(drive-in movie and water park fun all in one Vw. show !! )
        Have Fun !!

                    &quot; keep on pushin'&quot;

It would be great to have a row of busses
&gt; &gt; there, it'll be a fun time!
