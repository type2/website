Hey someone wanna help this guy out? He is in Italy and needs some Jals. BTW
Crazy DaveE is a real person and EveryBus is a camping event not a vendor.
Please respond to Marcelle not me :)&gt;

Hi Chris.

I read in your mail to type2_dot_com that you bought some Jalousie windows from
Crazy DaveE at EveryBus.
It's a long time I'm looking for a Jalousie window for my '79 Westy. I
usually buy the spare parts in U.S.A as they cannot be found in Italy, where
I live.
You would do a great kindness to me sending me the address and telephone
number of EveryBus and of every other supplier dealing in Jalousie windows
you may know.
Thank you very much.

Marcello.
