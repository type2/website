Subject: lamps for Brazilian repro buckets?
Date: Tue, 7 Mar 2000 13:36:58 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Hi folks, I bought some repros from Fisher buggies this weekend, they look
like all the others I have seen. However, the sealed bulb lights I have in
my stock German made buckets were too big!
I am unaware if this is the case, can someone confirm?
What bulbs do I need to buy? Why the *&amp;$% did they change them?
When I get the H4 non-sealed kits where you just replace the halogen bulb
it's self, will those fit? Do I have to specify?

TIA, Jeremiah Grover (67 Singlecab)
