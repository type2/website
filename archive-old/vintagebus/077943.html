Subject: Re: [VB] Heater Box?

OK, I got the heater boxes in, PITA w/o removing the engine.  The upper bolts
on the heater boxes were hard to get to.   I've got the cables connected.  But
I'm having a hard time with the one on the right.  I think it is the one that
connects to the knob???  Is this correct?  Also how does that knob work?  As
in where does the cable connect and which way do I turn it to get heat and to
loosen it?  I took the seat out, took the pedal pan off and I can't see
anything.


Thanks for the help.


Bart
