     Although, I haven't had the need to repack my 74 buses CV joints.  I can
say from past experience on other cars that the first mechanics answer of
filling the inside of the boot to keep the rubber from drying up is nonsense.
Even if you failed to get any grease on the boot, it would soon be coated within
a few miles of driving from heat and centrifugal force.  (Ever taken one apart
that wasn't?)  Also the outside of the boot is not covered with grease (and
isn't supposed to be), and is  exposed to air continuously, and doesn't crack,
until it gets very old.  If it does then it was installed wrong, or the rubber
is defective.
     Second, the answer of centrifugal force is also seems pretty far fetched to
me.  The purpose of the boot in the first place is to keep the centrifugal force
&gt;from throwing the grease off.  (Its also, there to keep the grease from getting
contaminated from water and dirt), and to keep it (the GREASE) from drying out.
Also 3 -4000 RPM is not going to be possible (at least not in a bus!) at the
rear axle.  If the wheel is approximately 2 foot in diameter then it will take
about 6.28 ft for one revolution.  Dividing this into 5280 equals about 840
turns per mile.  That means about 840 RPM's if you are driving 60 MPH.  Not a
very high RPM.  My Honda CRX has smaller wheels and I usually drive it faster
than the bus, so it should turn at a higher RPM, but no where close to 3-4000
RPM.  I bought the car new and it currently has 305,000 miles on it, and 3 of
the 4 CV joint boots are original on this car.  If you are only getting 5000
miles, then there would have to be something wrong with the boot itself (i.e. is
the quality good, do you know if anyone else has problems with the same type of
boot?), or something else wrong with the installation.  (Is there a chance the
boot is being stretched somehow?).  I have repacked many (although only a couple
VW's) and I &quot;squish&quot; the grease into all the bearings, plus add an additional
small amount.  I then usually squeeze out a little of the additional air, so I
can get the boot installed while retaining basically the same shape as it was
molded (i.e. not stretched or compressed along the axle).  I am presume would
keep the boot from being stressed so much.

                                   Good luck.
