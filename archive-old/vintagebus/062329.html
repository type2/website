Subject: RE: [VB] not Friday but I had to...

Sounds like one of those state assigned numbers like I got on my homebuilt
trike. Some states, (check recent threads on this), don't like the VW VIN
and it is hard to get an out of state vehicle licensed in some states. I
haven't had that problem here in WA, but some of the threads lately seem to
show that kind of thing going on. What is a &quot;special edition&quot; anyway?
Something the guy made up because he knows nothing about VW's ?
