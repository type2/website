&gt;&gt; It has been recommended here (by Eric&amp;Barb?) to drill these holes deeper 
and use longer bolts. &lt;&lt;
Hi Matt,
Guilty!!  ;-)

&gt;&gt; Is it possible to do this without damaging the existing threads, or do you 
have to drill the whole thing oversize?  &lt;&lt;

We drill ALL RGBs bolt mounting holes deeper on any bus tranny we deal with, 
to prevent the now old rusty crusty, and stressed factory threads from 
continuing to carry all the load.
&gt;&gt;  Is it even possible to do this while the RGB is in the Bus or is it 
better to take it out and put it on a drill press?  &lt;&lt;
It is possible to do the work with the tranny in situ, but for the novice it 
is a major pain to operate a hand held 1/2&quot; drill motor sideways.  Better to 
take the axles off and deal with operating the hand held 1/2&quot; drill motor in 
the same direction as gravity.  Plus if you drill a little too deep one can have 
the gear side of the hole through into the RGB area easily welded closed up.  
Technically one could press apart the axle sections, BUT one risks having 
alignment problems and even leaks in the joints you press it back together....
&gt;&gt; Would using studs with nuts on them work at all?  The problem I see with 
this is what happens when you want to remove the rear axle; you might not be 
able to move the transmission/axle tube/RGB outboard enough, or the rear end of 
the spring plate inward enough, to get the RGB free.  The main idea here is to 
avoid beating up the female threads if the rear axle was being installed and 
removed a lot.  &lt;&lt;
That would be a major PITA, due to the reasons you mention.  Plus sooo easy 
to bung up the studs threads as you force them over the swing plates.  We 
figure that if the threads in the holes do wear out, then it is time for the next 
step of using Time-Sert solid inserts.  They have an extra long special order 
insert 12x1.5x30mm that does the job well.  Then if the insert gets messed up 
it is an easy removal of the damaged insert and install a new insert.
BTW tanks for the LED info!
