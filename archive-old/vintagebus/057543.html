Subject: Re: [VB] Synthetic Test

&gt; I used Valvoline Synpower for my test. To give you an idea how syns compare
&gt; to dino oil, here is a test using Amsoil syn oil. Volvoline syn oil,
&gt; according to test specs, is very similar to Amsoil is composition.

Is it possible that
the problem with synthetics leaking I think was due to the broad range of
viscosities that the older ones had ie 5w50. Now that you can get
synthetic oils with the same viscosity ranges as dino ie 20w50 maybe they
will tend to leak less??
