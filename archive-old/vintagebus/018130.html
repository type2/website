In the barndoor section of my gallery pages, there's a *barndoor*
15 window.  Can't vouch for it's pedigree though.

There was a double-door 15-window FS here in Sac.  Shoulda bought it...

&gt; &gt;If we are talking about rarity, what about the 15 window?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; I wouldn't use the term &quot;rare,&quot; unless we are talking about a ribbed bumper
&gt; walkthrough 15-window, of which I have seen 3 real ones and a few fakes.
&gt; 
&gt; I submit to you the following order:
&gt; 15-window Deluxe
&gt; 23-window Deluxe
&gt; 21-window Deluxe
&gt; 13-window Deluxe
