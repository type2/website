Subject: trailering a bus

I used the double axle UHaul trailer to pull a '59
Panel from Phoenix, AZ to Muncie, IN (1500+mi)for 4
days last June, worked fine.  Used one of their trucks
to pull it, I don't recommend that at all.  The
trailer, however, worked fine.  The hardest part was
trying to slowly lower the bus down a hill from a
Toyota truck while we cranked the bus onto the trailer
with two come-alongs.  Once it was on, however, it
stayed fast.  The wheel tie downs up front didn't move
at all.  The size of the trailer was OK, but the
wheels were pretty close to the insides of the
trailer.  I think so long as you get it on well the
first time, and strap it down tight, you should be OK.
