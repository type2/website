Subject: RE: [VB] How do you buy a new/old Beetle from Mexico?

The company is called &quot;BeetleMex&quot; and they import a new Mexican beetle with
an old american vin number

Scott

I think you can get them in (pretty difficult) but you can't register them.
It has something to do with emmisions or safety regulations I think. Some
guy is selling on for $11,000! That's a pretty expensive parts car!
