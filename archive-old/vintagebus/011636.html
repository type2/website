&gt; As of 8/15/98, at Bob's request, the Sermons archive has been taken

A sad thing, but understandable considering the actions of certain
individuals on the vintagebus list.  It's unfortunate that folks who
become known for their talent have to put up with idiots like that.

I hope that Bob burns the sermons onto a CD and sells it through the
VW retailers on the list.  I have a $20 bill ready to send.  Please do
_not_ put your email address on the CD, Bob!

I have a question for the people who criticized Hoover:

When was the last time _you_ contributed anything to the list
community? 

I looked through the archives and all I found was a couple of requests
for information and a lot of whining about various topics.  Nothing
else of substance.  I suggest that these folk might be better off over
on alt.flame where they can get their kicks without causing any harm.
