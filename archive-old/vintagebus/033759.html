If the snap on tent piece is blue or green john  vwhoward_at_ctaz_dot_com could use
it on his DD. He has tents for both sides but just one of the skirts, you
could really make his month with that piece.

Karl and I tried to do the above on a junkyard 66kombi-camper. Karl recently
found a great junkyard engine on half-price day that was blowing ~135
compression after we fixed the PO botched generator installation, loose
exhaust studs, missing &quot;dime&quot; in the carb, etc. It's a stock doghouse
singleport from a '71 bus with the weird left heater duct. 
So it was time to pull the rod-knock dual port from the bus. I crawl under
to put a socket on the upper left bolt that threads into the insert of the
AH case engine. Can't get the socket on. Arms wrapped around the oily
transmission. Karl tries and finds the tranny has the D-bolt hole with a hex
head bolt jammed in it. So I pulled the doghouse tin to find out whether it
still had the insert. Yup, and a nice 17mm nut behind that! Did they drill
out the insert and put the nut on to pull the bolt? No, it was threaded in
the insert. Bad-word-Bad-Word. We had to remove the left side heater box to
get a wrench on the jammed in bolt head. Finally pulled the engine after
hours of this in 100+ heat. Luckily we have a half barrel from the local
brew-pub on tap and that the PO's whereabouts were unknown. 

Karl says he can get hex-head bolts that will fit in the D-bolt space, but
he runs his two splits with 3 bolts. Anybody need 'em?

Maybe somebody knows this bus... bright blue pedal pan, red gas tank with
the words &quot;Farfeg Mubin&quot; painted on it real nice. Has the dryest floors I've
ever seen in an original bus. The floor board in the cargo area is original
and nice. Under that is red primer/seal on perfect floors. See the pictures
on www.vintagebus_dot_com, search with &quot;Houck AND 66&quot; , look for the dove blue
camper. 

There was a piece of striped material that was nearly thrown away or used as
a rag until I noticed the snaps. It fits below the cargo doors as part of a
tent setup. Will take pics tonight and post, anybody need it? This may be a
Riviera, the tag is missing.
