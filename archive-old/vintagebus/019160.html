Your '57 wouldn't have had one; they were only done until 3/55

&gt; Hello everyone,
&gt;     I'm curious about this, my 57 singlecab has the bulkhead section removed 
&gt; in the middle so you can get at it from the cab from a previous owner. So I 
&gt; need to either find a matching piece, or see if the trap door could be an 
&gt; option. What year was this done until ?  Anyone have more info?
