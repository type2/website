Subject: [VB] Buddy L parts....
Message-ID: &lt;382C6AE5.2F113B43_at_empire_dot_net&gt;

    hopefully this would be considered a Friday topic...

    Looking for bits and pieces(cargo doors, interior seats, etc...) for
two Buddy L brand splittie busses...

    Any toy collector out there who might have a parts vehicle please
contact me...

    Also looking for HotWheels, Matchbox, Husky, Dinky brand Bus
toys...  I've decided to concentrate more on Bus/Transporter toys and
models so I'll have some interesting Beetle &amp; Dunebuggy stuff to sell or
swap...

    Also have a nice pair of Wolfsburg crest pewter cuff links that I
just bought from the original recipient (was given these when he
purchased his '64 Deluxe Sedan new).

    For any folks interested there will be a VW Toy and Literature show
in Portsmouth NH on Sunday Nov 14th...  e-mail me for details...

            JonR
