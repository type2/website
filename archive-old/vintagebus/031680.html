From what I have seen these are used on late 60's and early 61's only.  My
late 60 DD has them, but Matts early 60 (built 30,000 before mine doesn't).
My early 60 Westy does not have them. After looking at Kerrys Highroof I do
not think these will work as the upper hindge is highroof only, it has extra
bolt holes. The wedges are cool, but try to find the base seals for them. 2
years of looking and still none. If anybody out there has wedgey base seals
I need 4 of them.
