&gt;As gas prices inch upwords I was just toying with the idea of replacing my
&gt;daily driver F**d with something cheaper (gas-wise). Passatt would be nice -
&gt;if it would have TDI in it..

If a Jetta is too small, then this may not work, but if you want mileage
and reasonable room, do like I did and go buy a Toyota Prius.  I get
about 42-46 highway and about 44-48 city.  No, I didn't reverse those
numbers.  It is a hybrid gasoline and electric car: gas engine for
steady cruise and electric motor for accelerating and decelerating.
It uses the electric more in the city, so the city mileage is better.
The battery is charged by an onboard generator coupled to the gas
engine - you never plug it in.  It is also rated as SULEV on low-sulfur
(California) fuel.  Honda has a smaller hybrid, the Insight, which gets
even better mileage, like 60 mpg.  Did I mention the &quot;clean-fuel&quot; and/or
&quot;alternative fuel&quot; federal and state tax deductions?  :)

I would have liked to give my money to GM, Ford, or Chrysler, but none
of them make a car like this now (they plan to have them in 2003-2004).
So I sent it to Japan instead, probably aiding and abetting higher
Bus prices.  :)  I know Toyota builds some cars here in the US but
all Prii are built in Japan for now.

VW content: I think it would be interesting to get a Prius powertrain 
and shoehorn it into a Bus.  The main thing would be what you'd have
to do to the transmission/drive shafts to fit the transverse Toyota
transmission into the longitudinal VW layout.
