Those who have never lived long term in their buses don't know of the many
wonderous advantages of the aisle configuration. My daily driver for the
last 29 months is that 64 of which I lovingly speak occassionally. It's
got one of those damn bench seat Aisle blockers. It's the crawl-over
design. It sucks. I always need to get back there just about every time I
use the thing. If I wasnt so lithe and skinny I could never continue
owning it. I have had to develop methods of practically jumping over it
head first. I'd trade it for a walk thru in a second.

I guess it's becasue I am the Mechanic In Charge, AND the Flight
Attendant.
