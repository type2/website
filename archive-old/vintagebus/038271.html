In taking in consideration how to theft-proof our vehicles, a couple of
things come to mind...

1.  No matter what you do, if someone REALLY wants your bus, they will find
a way to get it.  Tow, cut, jump, whatever....

2. The club is a deterrent for the casual or spur-of-the-moment type thief.
Not for the hacksaw carrying pro.

My attitude towards the whole thing is that in the end, the vehicle is a
thing, an object. One associated with memories and experiences, mind you,
but all in all a thing that can be eventually replaced.  There are a lot
more important things to worry about than to spend countless hours and
sleepless nights wondering if your vehicle is still sitting outside your
house.  

My reccomendations.

- Keep in a garage
- Sleep in it.
- Don't keep anything of relative value in it and re-direct your worries
elsewhere.
