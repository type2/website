OK, so I am up for making a buck as much as anyone
else but time, energy, laziness and 112f Arizona heat
prompts me to post this to the list...

Baywindow westy fiberglass top sections (front and
rear) with hardware is currently sitting in an alley
behind DJ's Metropolitian Deli, North of Camelback on
7th Street, Phoenix, AZ. 

Go for it and get rich on eBay. Frankly I don't want
to clutter my property with it.

Fwd this to the type2 list.
