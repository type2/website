Subject: Screen Captures

I use a free utility called Screen Print 2000. Capture any part of the =
screen to a file or printer. Convert to B&amp;W, etc. Good stuff and worth a =
note to the author.=20

There are others, you can trust www.zdnet_dot_com for downloaded utilities.

 If you have Windows and can't or won't download and install software, =
then do the following...

1. Make the bus all pretty, get the image on your screen.=20
2. Hit the PrtScr key
3. Open Start, Programs, Accessorie, Paint.=20
4 Hit the menu's Edit, Paste=20
5. Print or save the file. Make note of where it's saved so you know =
where to pick up the attachment.
        =20
A word to people looking for New Year resolutions... Get Linux and learn =
it. It'll help you get away from the Microsoft monopoly and further your =
career. If you rely on MicroSoft for your technological career boost =
you're sorely misled. Do more with Linux and further the digital =
democratic revolution.=20
