Subject: Re: [VB]  Re: buying a westy out of state, how do I drive it home legally?


&gt; A topic from the Vanagon list was a good reason to cross-point to the
Vintage
&gt; list... It has been a while since I posted a good VanBondo story.
&gt;
&gt; Re: Proper registration or sneaking a vehicle home following a purchase.
&gt;
&gt; Executive Summary: Ellis says do it right if the tires are on the road.
&gt; Trailering it home or use of a commercial shipper is another story...
&gt;
-----------------------------------------original ends here&gt;

quite a story. I was considering driving my newly acquired Bus from LHC in
Arizona to Chicago but after a short discussion with Ronnie decided against
it. I kind of regret it now, kind of. So far I've been waiting almost three
weeks and the Bus is still in LHC and shipping company doesn't even know
when they'll pick it up.... so much for a good price! But I guess it's just
all my fault..... I'm cheap and scared of driving a Bus cross country......

But I think that I'm better off waiting for it than stuck somewhere in the
middle of nowhere, waiting for someone to rescue me... you never know.
quite a story....
