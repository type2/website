Has anybody seen or heard from Jason McDaniels? Its been over a year since we
heard from him and was wondering if he is still into buses. If you know of
this AWOL bus owner tell him to contact the Florida chapter.
                                            Signing off from this
transmission,
                                                          Captain Mike
                                                                 Bulli Pilot
