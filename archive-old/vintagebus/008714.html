I'm just curious if those who thought that this guy was really stupid for
what he did, could honestly stand there in amongst the crowd at BBB, knowing
full well it was a cool VW bus/hobbyist/fellowship type of event, and have
the guts to stand there and say these things to this guys face and in front
of everyone?  I would have been astounded at his nerve and bravity for doing
what he did.  Yeah, it might have been stupid, but I like doing stupid
stuff - especially for the enjoyment of others.  To think that some young
kid is going to be twisted into thinking it's okay to do these things is
kind of retarded.  There is a lot more violence on tv and other pervasive
influences in the world going on that will cause more trouble than a guy
with a junker bus at some VW bus event which nobody knows or even cares
about (speaking about the vast majority of people here - not the VW crowd).
If you can do something dumb and get away with it - awesome - but just be
prepared to pay the price if you get pulled over or involved with the law -
it's your risk - but I'll be enjoying hearing your whole story someday -
I'll give you that much credit. :-)
