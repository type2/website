&lt;&lt; please tell me if my 1960 single cab reguires the front wheel seals when I 
 change the wheel bearings ? &gt;&gt;
Hi John,
Yes!  All buses do.  The seal goes on the inside of the drums to seal the 
inner beearing and it's grease from dirt, dust, sand, and grim from brake 
shoes and the road.  Check your original VW bus shop manual or Bentley 
reprint.  Without this proper informantion to use as a referance you are 
putting your bus, your life and any passengers at risk!  Remember if it does 
not roll, stop and steer properly things will come to a nasty end very 
quickly!  Eric&amp;Barb
