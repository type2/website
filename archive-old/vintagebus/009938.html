This weekend I have gone &quot;whole hog&quot; with the front end of the bus (I had to
because there wasnt alot of life in the brake system and I had a leaking cyl
on the left front.  I still have a leaking one on the back (and new shoes,
etc) but the rear end is next weeks project.
I have done the following:
Rotors turned
Inner/outer bearings
New brake shoes
New cyl (all 4 of them)

Now that I have done everything, I can not get pressure to hold on the brake
line.  The first two pumps go all the way to the floor, and the third time
it catches and the bus stops very nicely.  I have bled the brakes 3 times
and still have the same problem.  This was never a problem before (it used
to go down about 2/3 of the way and just would not stop).  According to the
maint records I  received last summer the M/C was replaced 7K miles ago
(although that was ~5 years ago in actual time).

Having never done a brake job in my life, I am betting I missed something
obvious (or maybe I need to keep bleeding).  Any guidance would be most
appreciated
(BTW I tried the archives and could not get in)

Thanks in advance; Rich
'67 microbus (which has decided to kick my butt today!!!)
