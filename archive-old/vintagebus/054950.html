There was a tIII trans in this, from the previous lowering, perhaps he used 
the wrong bowden tube as well? &gt;&gt;

Hi AL,
As far as we have seen boden tubes are all the same.  You just need to make 
sure the boden tube has about 5/8&quot; of bend to it when it is in place.  Make 
sure that the rear of the clutch cable body tube is welded in place!  On our 
1960 panel walk thru camper conversion this body tube was broken loose at 
most of the rear welds and was allowing it to flex around when one would use 
the clutch pedal.  If you have the same problem remove the clutch cable and 
weld the tube back in place.  If you do not remove the cable it can end up 
being welded into the tube permenantly.  Making sure you really heavily weld 
the rearmost weld on this tube to prevent it from starting breaking loose 
there again!    Eric&amp;Barb
