Subject: HELP  my oil cooler exploded , again .....
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

hey all ,  

I have been having trouble figuring out what is going on with my 1600 dp
It is a rebuilt 1600 dual relief case that has about 1000 miles on it and 
about 
three weeks ago I backed it out of the garage and noticed a large trail of 
oil .

after realizing it was the cooler &lt;stock&gt;  I pulled the motor and put another 
oil cooler on. &lt;used ,but good shape&gt;  I reinstalled the motor and was 
driving it only 
hours later and it ran well for about 100 more miles and then The replacement 
cooler
blew out yesterday . I dont think that both of the coolers are bad , so what 
was causing this to happen ?    obviously my oil pressure is building up  but 
why ?

got any good ideas????????????  thank you           John Clancy
