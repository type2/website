&lt;&lt; I have a 4&quot; inch grinder with a 5/8 shaft.  I think that's the

Hi Aaron,
Hmm, we have a Makita angle grinder, and can find not only wire wheels for 
it, but wire that is braided for more strength.  Works great for those curved 
areas.  We also use pieces of cut off saw blades that are designed to cut 
sheet metal.  After using acid to remove most of the rust there are islands 
of tougher rust resisting the acid removal so we use pieces of cut off disc 
that had gotten to small of diameter to be saafe to use to erase these 
islands of rust.  Lastly when most of the rust is removed via wire wheel, 
sand paper, acid, there often is pockets of rust in pits in the sheet metal 
in the window frames.  If you use a sharp tipped nail and hammer to shock the 
rust pockets they pop out and need just anothe acid treatment to remove the 
last of the rust from the pit.  Eric&amp;Barb
