Subject: Re: [VB] California &quot;Pink&quot; slips

&gt;Another thing I've noticed is that alot of buses with og black or og yellow plates have &quot;commercial&quot; truck plate number sequences.  My 63 EZ Camper has normal &quot;passenger&quot; car black plates with the AAA 123 sequence.
&gt;
My '65 EZ is registered as a &quot;housecar&quot; meaning anything goes as long as 
it's behind the driver, and not illegal.
It's treatedt he same as John Maddens tour bus, or grandma and grandpa's RV
It was originally a Panel as well. DD walkthru to boot!
