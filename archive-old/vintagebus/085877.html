Subject: whiners and moaners .

we've lost some really knowledgeable folks off here
because of the whiners and moaners .
----------------------------------
As you might know:
 It comes &amp; it go's.

There are many folks that contribute to this community
that don't whine or moan! We know who they are. &quot;UJ&quot;
That group from Havasu.
 Not to mention all those who arrive at the events
from all over the country.
 We can put up with a few whiners &amp; moaners.
