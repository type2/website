I guess I was too busy fondling my pretty new Bentley and forsake the simple
folkwisdow of the idiot guide. I also have to agree with you that Neil is
prolly right. I have a bad habit of overdoing it in my head before I pick up
a wrench:) I ran through the Muir front end chapter and have a clearer
understanding of the whole shabang. I am worried that my '67 has those king
and link pin thingys that Muir said were dropped in '65:) Oh well......

Clara rightly pointed out.......

&gt;I belive Neil knows what he is talking about, so get you a new drag link and 
&gt;get it put on the car. Or do it yourself .  I us ethe BFH method.  ( If you 
&gt;want to double check his diagnosis, or just see the deal, lie under your bus 
&gt;looking up at the steering stuff and have someone gently wiggle the wheel in 
&gt;the loose area.   Read the idiot book chapter on steering. ) \
