&gt;Everything works just fine and as it should except for
&gt;the brake lights when the key is off.  This includes
&gt;all lights, turn sig's and emergency flasher system. 

It is correct for the brake lights to not work with the key off.

&gt;(btw, this is all 12v) (also, the turn signal light on
&gt;the dash is dim which may be a clue but i do not know)
&gt;When i turn the key switch to &quot;on&quot;, the turn signals
&gt;and emergency flashers will not work anymore. 
&gt;Nothing.  Everything else seams to be all right.  As
&gt;soon as i turn the ignition back off, wala.  It all
&gt;works again.

You (still) have something hooked up wrong, most likely at the
speedometer or at the turn signal flasher can - the thing
that mounts immediately to the left of your fuse box.

There should be three connectors at the turn signal flasher.
One should have just one thin blue wire - this is the wire to
the indicator bulb in the speedometer.  Another should have two
thicker wires - one black/purple and one black/white/green - 
this is the always-hot feed from the fuse panel.  The last
connector should also have two wires, both black/white/green -
this is the on/off pulsing output voltage.  Originally, the
stock flasher was grounded through its mounting stud, providing
a fourth connection.

Testing: Pull all three wires off the flasher and don't let
them touch ground (sheet metal) or one another.  The speedometer
turn indicator light should be OFF, but like OFF.  If it is
otherwise, you have a bad connection at the speedometer.  OK.
Ground the light blue wire to the body and check the indicator
light again - should still be OFF - again, if not, wiring
trouble at speedometer.  Turn the key on and now the indicator
light should be ON brightly - if not, trouble at speedometer
or ignition switch.  Turn the key off and unground the light
blue wire.

Now get a test light (not a voltmeter).  Ground one end and
connect the other end to the connector with the black/purple
and black/white/green wires.  The test light should light up
no matter if the key is on or off.  If not, check into the
ignition switch and fuse box.

Finally, hold the two connectors with two wires together with
a clothespin or something.  You should be able to operate the
turn signal lever and make the turn signal bulbs on that side
of the car light up steadily.  Pulling out on the hazard knob
should make all four turn signal bulbs light up steadily.
All this should work with the key on and the key off.  If
it isn't like this, you have trouble in the turn signal
switch or the wiring to each bulb.

OK, if your wiring passed, it must be that aftermarket flasher
you're using.  :)  Does it have two or three terminals?  Either
way, look for a diagram stamped on the side of the can, or letters
in the plastic or phenolic base by the terminals.

Two terminals: Connect the connector with two different colored
wires in it to the &quot;X&quot; terminal and the two other connectors to
the &quot;L&quot; terminal.

Three terminals: Connect the connector with two different colored
wires in it to the &quot;X&quot; terminal.  Connect the connector with two
same-colored wires in it to the &quot;L&quot; terminal.  Connect the remaining
connector (light blue wire) to the &quot;P&quot; terminal.

If you have a four-terminal aftermarket flasher, hook it up like
the three-terminal.  You will have one terminal left over - run
a new wire from it directly to ground.

If none of this gets it, let us know, because then it really gets
interesting.  :)

Good luck!
