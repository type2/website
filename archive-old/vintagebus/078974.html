Subject: Testing Old Thermostat

Anyone know how to test an old thermostat?  I'm assuming you can apply heat of
some sort and see if it expands but, I'm not sure at what temperature it
should expand and how far.
I found this in the archive:

&quot;The test involves using an old metal pan with water and placing it on the
stove.  Only mild heat is required.  If the thermostat is working, it will
expand.  I found out long ago that too much heat will over extend the
thermostat and ruin it because it stretches out too far.&quot;

Does anyone know at what temperature it should be fully contracted and at what
temperature it should be fully expanded?  Also, I found a few other references
to submerging it in hot water but couldn't this damage it if their are are any
holes, cracks, etc?
Thanks!
Mike
