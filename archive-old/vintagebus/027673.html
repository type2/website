Subject: small nut tranny and redux boxes FS Puyallup Wash

Hello Vintage Bussers:

I am headed to Puyallup Fair Grounds in Washington for the Springmeet on
the 30th and can bring along a 1963 small-nut transaxle and redux boxes
and drums, all in one piece, if anyone is interested in it. $50. All I
know is that the guy who left it with me told me that it came out of a
running 1963 bus that was stripped. I make no claims about it. 

If you want it I will strap it onto the roofrack and haul it to
Puyallup. If no one wants it, it stays in my shop.

Let me know via p-mail.
