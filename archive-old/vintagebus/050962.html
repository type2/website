I like it but would suggest moving the &quot;Vintagebus&quot; to first line and the
_at_Type2_dot_com to the second line, centered in available white space below the
three rear windows. Minor rch adjustment to the forward end of the bus ~if
necessary~ for visual balance. The graphic is appropriately graphic, cute,
easily reproduced in various media and is nebulously simple to the point at
which some huge multinational auto manufacturer can't/shouldn't sue anyone and
confiscate the stickers.
Just my opinion...
