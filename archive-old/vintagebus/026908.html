In answer to Andy's post:

The original black ones seem to Bakelite but when cut, they have a
slightly rubbery smell. The white ones are a similar material but an
off white color and provide a different odor when cut. The original
units were most likely painted after the mold flash was removed.

The material that I am using is the same as that used by automobile
manufacturers to make things like spoilers. It is a hard  polyurethane
foam. It is hard but not as hard and dense as the original stuff. As
long as you don't beat on these with a hammer or other hard tool, they
will hold up very well.
