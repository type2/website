Subject: Re: [VB] What a mess....

Those are burned valves. They would be replaced if the heads were
rebuilt, so they aren't a big deal. You don't usually see so many valves
burned that bad on an engine. One usually drops by then.

Speaking of valves; I just got some 1600 sp heads rebuilt. When the guy
who did the work took the valves out, one of the exhaust valves broke in
his hand. Pretty good timing, huh?

&gt; Hi Bus People   Ok,I never wrote I was a great VW
&gt; engine man...or a great VW anything.Even I know
&gt; exhaust valves should not have parts missing from
&gt; them.I took the heads off the little 1200 I got for
&gt; 100 bucks 3 years ago which had run find until
&gt; now.Well off come the heads and it looks as if mice
&gt; had been chewing at the exhaust valves.There is enough
&gt; metal missing in #1 and #2 to almost stick a push rod
&gt; thru there between valve and head.And #3 is on its
&gt; way....#4 was cool.
