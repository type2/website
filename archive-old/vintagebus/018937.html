 This thread is getting a bit tired, since apparently you can't comprehend my message. Let me state once again that I am NOT in favor of inspections as they stand. I merely feel that they can be a benefit if administered in a uniform, competent manner. This includes not having them done by some slack-jawed yokel, but a certified professional, in a professional setting. Profit is NOT a concern of mine at this point. Our business LOSES money on every inspection we do. I bring up prices and costs to illustrate the absurdity of the situation. Read my first post, i used the term &quot;farce.&quot; Do I need to define this? The point is that we could use our time more efficiently doing repairs that wee are compensated for rather than the state mandated procedure for sub-minimum wage. That is the point, my friend. 

&gt; &gt; &gt;George Lyle wrote:&gt; Fine.  The cops can pull them over and cite them if they have &gt;reasonable cause to do so.  One very nice thing about our system of law is that the
&gt; government has the responsibility to prove violators guilty of crimes.  We
&gt; should not have to prove ourselves innocent on a yearly basis.

Cops can't see a separated tie rod, passing a car in traffic, now can they? What are you proposing here? Random Big Brother roadside checks? Sounds like an annual inspection to me? Your logic is skewed....

&gt; And your inspection is going to guarantee that the car is safe to drive
&gt; until the next inspection?  I think not.  By necessity you'll approve
&gt; brake pads that will be worn out long before another year passes.  If
&gt; they're within wear limits, you'll have to pass them.  Tires
&gt; with 3/32 of tread depth will pass your inspection and be &quot;unsafe&quot; 5000
&gt; miles later.

True, but on average, 10% of the cars we inspect monthly fail and are repaired. Numbers don't lie. Correcting a hazard, whether it is 1 or 100 is a benefit. Last month a 1990 Isuzu pickup came in for an inspection, the frame separated at the rear leaf spring shackle when it was lifted in the air. A cop would have never seen that. 
&gt; 
&gt; Also, what about the damage done by the &quot;inspector&quot; during the course of
&gt; the inspection?  What about the stripped or broken wheel studs caused by
&gt; some idiot forgetting to switch his air wrench from &quot;semitruck&quot; to &quot;VW&quot;?
&gt; The number of mechanics qualified and willing to work on our buses is
&gt; dwindling, and to be forced to take my bus to some unqualified mechanic to
&gt; meet a legal requirement is abhorrant.

Professionals don't use air wrenches to tighten lugs. That is what a torque wrench is for, and torque specs, for that matter.
 
&gt; Ah yes, I don't want to give up my right to own and operate a
&gt; vehicle without submitting it to your inspection so I must be neglegent
&gt; of my children.  Actually, I care about them very much and want them to be
&gt; able to live their lives without having to answer to self-appointed safety
&gt; experts.

Again, I referred to the current systems as a farce. &quot;Self-appointed&quot; is a term that doesn't apply in a properly administered program.

&gt; Sorry, but your argument doesn't wash.  It has never been shown that
&gt; inspection programs reduce accident rates in any way.  If they did, you
&gt; can bet your bottom dollar that the news would be sung from the rooftops
&gt; by the governmment and the inspection industry.

True. But again the systems in place are a joke. How many times do I need to say this? For the measly amount charged and the lack of a statewide training system, and a simple pass/fail method, many cars fall through the cracks. I cited this in my first post.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; So, it seems that if you were allowed to charge $50 for an inspection you
&gt; &gt; &gt; would be all for them.  Your only objection seems to be that you aren't
&gt; &gt; &gt; allowed to charge enough for them.

You are hung up on money aren't you. Let me ask again: do you work for free?  Bottom line. An unsafe car takes out someone you care about. Here in NC, the shop (and the technician) that inspected the car could be charged with a wrongful death - it has happened to a shop near here. Do you think that that anyone in our shop is going to take a shortcut and take this risk? Would you put that kind of liability on your shoulders for $8.25 I think not.

&gt; &gt; Is your time not valuable in the market place? If not, come on over,  my house
&gt; &gt; needs painting.....I may be able to afford you.
&gt; 
&gt; Perhaps you should be required to have a &quot;Certified Painter&quot; come
&gt; into your house, don't you care about your children?

Apples and oranges, my friend. Besides I didn't raise paint-eaters. We had real food in the house. Eating paint is optional, riding in a motor vehicle of some sort on our highways is certainly not in out society. It only takes one accident to die, a lot of paint to get sick.
&gt; 
&gt; Absurd?  Yes.  Just as absurd as the concept that anyone should be
&gt; forced to use the services of a vehicle inspector.

&gt; Enthusiasts are certainly against inspections.  Professionals, including
&gt; you, are definitely for them as long as they can profit from them.  You
&gt; stated this clearly above.

No, I didn't. What I said was that if it is going to be mandated by the state, persons performing the inspections should be adequately compensated. Again &quot;profit&quot; is not the issue. 
Do you not believe in a &quot;living wage&quot; or adequate compensation for what you do? What if the state said you had to do a certain aspect of your job, but couldn't be compensated for it. Your argument here indicates that you  would jump right in and do it for free. Hence my offer to paint my house.....
 
&gt; There are hundreds of businesses here that do nothing but inspections.  In
&gt; fact they advertise themselves as &quot;inspection only&quot; on the premise that
&gt; they won't &quot;make work&quot; for themselves as many &quot;inspection and repair&quot;
&gt; garages do.  They pay big bucks for machines, but they have a captive
&gt; audience that is forced to use their services every two years.  They don't
&gt; seem to be going bankrupt at all.

Exceptions, rather than the rule....not like a MickeyD's franchise, now is it. If it were this great be-all-end-all, I imagine it would be pounced on buy venture capitalists and network marketers, and every other &quot;get rich quick&quot; guru in the world.
 
&gt; I comprehend you well.  Your message is clear.  You can't do a proper
&gt; inspection for $9.  You want the fee cap lifted so that you can do a
&gt; proper inspection for more money.

No. Again, what I advocated in my first post: As they stand, they are a farce. Either abandon them all together, or set them up to where they will be done in a uniform competent manner. I just don't like to have to do a service for a ridiculously low state-mandated fee. 

&gt; This is my last post on this topic.

Mine, too. I think we agree more than you think. I just didn't appreciate your attack on my profession. The discussion grew from there. I still want to know how you get by working for free, though
