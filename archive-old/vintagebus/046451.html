Hello bus gurus.  I have a question or two.  The first is just a curiosity.  
Part number 211 721 631A  and  211 721 631B.  It seems the B is for early bus 
and A is for late.  Am I confused or is this one of those oddball VW 
contradictions?

- - --  -
the one with the prefix A is earlier than the one with the prefix B (and 
there may be C, D, E, F etc versions)

211 721 631  is lever- accelerator cable (LHD) from ch 20-117 902   (58 , 63 
ed)
211 721 631 B is lever- accelerator cable (LHD) from ch 20- 117 902 (mid 67 
ed)

I figure version A is the same thing.  evidently they tried to improve the 
part, but as you know, they still get bent.  oh well.  nice to have a new one.
..........
The second question is on part number 211 425 119.  What are these?  I 
couldn't find them in my books.  They are a grommet or bushing of some sort.

 well, the 4 section is front axe/steering, but I dont see a 425 group.  hm
