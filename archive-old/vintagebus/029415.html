Subject: Re: [VB] welding with a MIG
References: &lt;008001c0228c$a45566c0$6b62723f_at_mycomputer&gt;

The difference is night and day. I've done both, and as soon as I'm out of
flux-core wire, I'm converting my Lincoln Weld-Pak 100 to full MIG. I've
already bought the conversion kit, actually, and am literally just burning up
the flux core on crap projects where weld prettiness is not essential. If I
don't use up the flux core before I start welding my next vehicle body, I'm
going to convert anyway.

The major difference with the flux core is that as the core burns, it sputters,
and makes for lousy welds. Stuff that I would weld once with MIG takes me three
times with the flux core to get it right, and my arms get sore from all that
grinding.

Granted, you can control flux core somewhat, but MIG will make a world of
difference.

Sincerely,
John Cloonan

&gt; I own a 110v Century Flux Core Mig Welding machine.  My question is this.
&gt; Has anyone ever welded with BOTH a fluxcore machine, and a gas (ARGON) MIG
&gt; welder? I can't seem to make anything but popcorn welds with my flux core
&gt; machine, and am thinking about buying a real 220v Gas Mig welder.  Is there
&gt; that big of a difference in the flux core, and the gas? Or is it just my
&gt; welding skills?
&gt;
&gt; Any input would be greatly appreciated!!
&gt;
