&gt;    silk thread? for what? i guess i must have missed something &lt;vbg&gt; if
&gt;it's for the distributor drive gear, there are better and easier ways to do

There have been lots of questions directed my way about the use of silk
thread on the case halves.  If I'm not mistaken, this is from Bob Hoover's
Sermons.  I believe it was him that used a thin strand of silk thread on the
case halves with &lt;non-silicone gasket sealer of your choice&gt;.  I want to be
sure there are no leaks so I'm gonna try it out.  I've since been told that
dental floss works too but of course, I found out after I spent $4.75 for a
spool of thread about 20 minutes ago.  I have dental floss on hand. :-)

Another question people have had is &quot;what do I mean by 'sealing nuts' on the
6 main engine studs?&quot;  Well if you are familiar with the oil pump sealing
nuts, it's just like that only bigger.  These are dark (if not black)
looking nuts that have a red ring of a soft plastic material on the face
that goes towards the engine.  As they are torqued down, they form a seal
against any wonton oil seepage.  This T3 block had that style of nut on the
6 main studs so I was wondering if should use this kind of nut or not.  I
would feel better using them but if others have had success using nylocks,
well then I won't argue about it...

That's it for now...
