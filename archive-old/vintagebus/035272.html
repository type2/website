 &gt; Hi Volks,
 &gt; Clara and Greg's instructions are good, but left out an important beginning
 &gt; proceedure.  You must find the center point of the steering box.
 
 That's what I meant by *straight*. Good thing you pointed it out though. I 
know
 of a local guy that *didn't* do this and had a sweet turning radius to the 
left,
 but the right left much to be desired....
  &gt;&gt;
I had written,
&quot; Position the wheel straight forward.  Position the steering wheel so it is 
in the middle of the turning ...&quot;

That's what I meant by 'the middle of the turning', but I guess it wasn't 
very clear.

Clara
