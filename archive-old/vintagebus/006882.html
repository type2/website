   Just arrived, the  door hindge screws from Germany. These have the
correct size head! They are approx. 1 MM shorter then original, but in
testing on one of my buses there is more then enough thread. These screws
are gold zinc plated, limited quanities, but more on the way. I had to make
sure they were correct head size and would work properly.


thanks   ronnie
