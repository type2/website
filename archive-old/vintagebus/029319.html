Subject: BNNTA: My perspective

Hi all,
After working on Frodo for 3 years, Being at Busses No Where Near The
Bridge 2000 was an obsession for me. Slowly but surely I laid my plans.
I sent my wife and daughter to Minnesota to see the inlaws. Put Robert
Laffoon on the bus to Tulsa to buy a beautiful '66 single cab. Robert's
son spent the night at my place and early Friday morning we left Omaha
to hook up with NQ in St Joe MO. This is the first time my Westy has
been asked to travel more than 40 miles in a single journey in 28 years.
In fact the motor had less than 700 miles on it since the rebuild.
Knowing that that I was about to make a trip of over 800 miles in 3 1/2
days was both thrilling and a bit scary. I knew nearly every nut and
bolt on it and I knew she was as ready as I could make her. She ran like
a champ. My last tank gave me nearly 28 mpg. Dick Bozarth of Omaha built
me a very sweet motor and I can never thank him enough for that.
NQ gave you a wonderful commentary on our journey across MO. As a matter
of fact he told the whole story quite well. The only additions I want to
make are to thank Jamie Rivers for fixing my turn signal flasher and say
thank you to everyone that stopped by and said hello. It never ceases to
amaze me how even miles from nowhere a volkswagen can be fixed well
enough to get home safely.
I will be putting up all of the photos NQ, Robert and I took iver the
next few days. Those people that participated in the Splitty photo shoot
organized by Robert will be hearing from me in the next couple of days.
The pictures are wonderful.
There is one photo in particular of NQ and Robert I wanted to share with
the list. NQ was commenting on how people are always trying to catch him
out of his coveralls. Well if you want to see that go to this link

(and y'all thought the bondo comment would go unrewarded)

Frodo a happy 65 Westy
