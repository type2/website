Hey List

So I'm thinking about some sort of low cost anti-theft device.  Is there any
sort of consensus on the kill switch idea.  I was thinking about putting a
switch in one of the lines coming from my fuse box and hiding it somewhere
in the cab. Which fuse would be best - guess I oughta  just figure it out -
but any advice is appreciated.
