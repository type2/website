&lt;&lt; I have to agree with Greg Noble on this one. To give an award to an 
obviously 
 unsafe, illegal 350 mile road trip, really does send the wrong message to 
 people who view this hobby or business, via the Internet, magazines or the 
12 
 o'clock news. &gt;&gt;


Well, I didn't see this vehicle, but I'm going to speak up. Its amazing to me 
that I and others who customize busses (correctly not cheaply) are 
criticized, yet a &quot;junker&quot; like this is praised!

Here in the Southeast I see busses on the road all the time, and the majority 
are junkers and the owners seem proud of how bad they can make them look. 
Rusty, unpainted or bad paint, parts missing or barely attached, leaking oil, 
smoking, slow (anybody here?) The so called perfectly &quot;restored&quot; busses I 
only see at shows. At least I drive mine and it looks and rides good and is 
safe. If it had a mind, I'm sure it would be proud.....
