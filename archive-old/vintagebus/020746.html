Subject: '59 DC, '64 Camper  FS

I mentioned that if anyone wanted any info on these cars, or wanted me to
look specifically at something on it, to email me.  That just got more
real, since it was moved yesterday.  Anyway, I spoke with the owners
brother last night, I still know where they are, so the offer still
stands.
