&lt;&lt; Hey listees,
 	Does anyone know of a supplier of good used front windshield glass? I
 craked both of mine last year trying to put new seals in :( Sort of feel
like
 an idiot for that, but the magazine I was using for pointers said to &quot;sit on
 the front seat and push on the glass with your feet&quot;. They made a horrible
 noise when they cracked, but it didn't sound like $150/pair plus an
 additional &quot;crating fee&quot; worth! That price is out of the Motorworks catalog,
 and I have no comparison of what they should cost. Since I live in the
frosty
 northwoods, finding a splitty in a junkyard is nearly impossible. Thanks in
 advance... &gt;&gt;

You can just go to an auto glass place and have them cut it new for you. My
side windows were all replaced in tinted glass for $20 each!
