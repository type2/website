Subject: Anyone ever gone psycho over their wiring?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hello,
  I was wondering if anyone wanted to unload a 67
dimmer relay.  I've become obsessed with making my
brights work.  I have the mechanism on my switch for
the lift up for brights.  Is this relay hard to find
or can I use any old relay from an auto parts store? 
Can I rebuild or fix my existing relay?  With a test
light, I should be able to switch my brights and see
the different terminals send juice right?  Is it
possible that I wired it wrong so that the terminals
dont switch?  Is there a way to test it simply to see
if it is my wiring or the relay or the switch that is
the culprit?  I'm hearing the clicking of the switch
but it does'nt send juice to any other terminal for
the brights?  Help.  Sorry about all the questions,
I'm just stuck in limbo after 3 full days.  The rest
of the rewiring was hell enough. My Bentley's
schematic does'nt account for all the terminals.  56,
56a, 56b?  I only have 56, 56a, s, and I think one
other one?(maybe f or v)  I cant get my dash indicator
to blink either?(bulb's good)   Thanks for ANY input
and may your rewiring go smoother than mine. Tip= Do
it &quot;yourself&quot; FROM THE BEGINNING!
