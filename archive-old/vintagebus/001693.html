Content-Description: cc:Mail note part

     I am gathering parts for a transaxle swap/redux rebuild for my '66
     standard.  Evreyone that I've talked to or seen advertised sells
     rebuilt transaxles without nose cones, axles, and redux boxes.  The
     reason I'm looking for a rebuilt unit is that I believe my fulcrum
     plates are worn and are the reason I'm getting loud metal clanking
     noises every time I accelerate.  I'm also assuming the paddle ends of
     the axles are equally as worn but won't know this until I start
     removing them.  I am not interested in taking on the job of doing the
     rebuild myself, just the swap will be hard enough, physically on this
     old, abused body.

     In preparation for this bigass job I'm gathering parts now.  The
     questions are:
        Once I get them out, how do I measure my current axles at the
     paddle end to determine their worthiness?

        If I need replacements where do I get them?

        I have a set of axles that look very nice with redux boxes that are
     identical to Lea's '63 single cab.  I've been saving them for the day
     when her vehicle might need them.  Does anyone know whether these
     axles are the same length and design as mine in the '66?  Are axles
     generally interchangeable?  I know the redux boxes and stub axles are
     very different but I don't need to swap those.

     Hoping for enlightenment.
