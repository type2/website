Subject: Re: [VB] Generator Woes

6v generators  actually do say 7V on them, so that is normal! 
 ditto for the regulator.
 
There are two sizes of 6V generators, one is larger than the other.  The ealier one (through 64 or 65) are the same og as the 12V generators.   They have separate regulators.  The take the same gen brushes as the 12V ones.
 
The earlier generators are smaller diameter than the 12V ones, (so the gen stand is differnt) They take different gen brushes.
 
If the gen light started coming on at idle, then later at speed, I'd suspect the gen brushes.   Look in the slot on top near the gen pulley... there is a spring holding a carbon/graphite rectangular block in there.  That is the brush.   The carbon rectangle should poke up above the sides of the metal slot it is in.   If it doesn't it is worn out, go buy a new pair.   They cost about $7 I think.  You may want to take an old one with you to the store to make sure you get the right kind.  Sometimes a FLAPS will sell them, definately a VW store. There is another on the underside, trickier to get to it.   
 
To change the brushes, remove the screw holding the wire that leads form the graphite rectangle.  Don't lose the screw!  Pry back the metal tang/spring holding the rectangle (brush) in place, use a slotted screwdriver or popsicle stick.  grab the wire from the rectangle (makaybe use needlenos epliers) and pull the old brush out.
 
To install, slide the new brush in (with tang pulled out of the way) release tang spring.   Screw wire in place.  Repeat with the trickier underside one.  
 
 
-----Original Message-----
I have a 1963 bus still running a 6V electrical system. It's got a 1600 single 
port engine in it.

We took a 4th of July weekend road trip... 
Saw the the red (gen) light flicker a couple of times, amd finally in Warm 
Springs OR on the way back, it came on and stayed on.

I changed the belt when I got home, and it was still on. Changed the rotor, the 
points, and rebuilt the (remote mount) regulator/cleaned and checked all the 
connections of corrosion, etc.

...
