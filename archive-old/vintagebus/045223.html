I have actually been to VW shows where vendors sell &quot;original&quot; cans of VW 
paint.  Are these any good after 30-50 years or are they just collectibles to 
sit in your garage and make you feel more like a VW mechanic.  In other 
words, if I happen to find a batch of Titian Red for my 66 Micro is it a 
silly pipe dream to think I can use it to repaint my bus?
