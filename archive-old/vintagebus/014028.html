Hey guys, any double cab freaks out there?

I have been strictly a westy guy over the years...so
not 100% up on the values of other odd ball
buses....anyhoo...I have been contacted about a `61
Double cab that owner is looking to move.

Story goes...he bought it in Arizona in `70.  Moved to
Colorado in `71 drove the DC until `75.  Moved to Ohio
in `75 parked the DC in his shed/garage until present.
The buses sounds rust free and damage free (accidents
ect)  Still original Gray factory paint...condition???
 O f course it has sat 20 years so it does not run
drive ect...no problem with me but thats the
condition.  The guy is reallll &quot;spook-able&quot; about
sellin it and I don't wanna offend him on a low ball
price and loose the thing to someone esle for just a
couple 100$ more.  Going to check it out
tomorrow...will know specifics then...but what these
things going for in complete rust free...just outta
the barn but nice shape??  $500-$1500??? or
what...Thanks

Todd
