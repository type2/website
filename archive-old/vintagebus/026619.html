Well,

I guess you could be like most Americans today and sue the gas company for
any real or imagined damages, but then you'd be contributing to the down fall
of our society with another frivolous law suit.  But seeing as they really
did f'ck up, if you did have any legitimate damages to your bus, they are
liable to pay.  New engine, lost business time, etc..

Try and see if any other customers had the same problem .  Go and find out
who owned the station and ask them.  Be specific with date, time, amount,
pump # &amp; exactly what happened.  If this did happen, you can bet there are
lots of people with shinny (not that your bus isn't) new FI cars that are
going no where fast with that witches brew sitting in their tanks.

Good luck.

Steve
