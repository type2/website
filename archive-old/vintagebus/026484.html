&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;luggage compartment? what? - oh is this a bug? what make and model
VW is

this?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

Don't worry about it.  It's easy to confuse the bus and the bug if you
use the name type 1 which can be used as another name for beetle. Type
1 is also another name for the first generation bus with the split
window.  My Type 1 is a 77' Beetle with FI.  So it has two gas lines. 
One runs from the tank to the engine and another one does the same but
the flow of gasoline is in the opposite direction.  Here's my latest
theory.  As I first start off driving there is more pressure in the
tank because of the heat.  once the flow of fuel starts moving through
quickly with the electric fuel pump the amount of pressure is just
enough to cause some leakage of gasoline out of the connections where
the rubber hoses connect underneath to the long length of metal fuel
line.  After the 5 min the pressurized fuel system goes down and the
leaking stops.  I will take the gas cap off and push the metal flap
inside open just before take off tomarrow.  I'll keep you guys
updated.  Any more ideas you guys might want to share would be greatly
appreciated.
TIA

I need some help pinpointing some leaks on my Volksie.  It seems to be
leaking oil but there are no oil spots on the driveway.
------

how do you know it is leaking and not burning oil  (I am guessin the
oil
level goes down)  It could also be spitting oil from thecrank pulley,
which
may be a sort of spin marks of oil, or a fine misting settleing
everywhere n
the engine compartment.  easiest to pinpoint oil leaks if you clean
the motor
and then examine it after driving.

..............

.......  So my guess
is the pushrod tubes, can't be around the oil pressure switch because
I already fixed that.  It seems to loose oil at high revvs.  I looked
underneath with a flashlight around the cooling tin and I can see some
black sludge around the end of one pushrod tube where it meets the
cylindar head.  How can I fix this with ease?  Can I remove the
rockers and push rods and break the pushrod tubes off then install the
type of pushrod tube that has a spring so it can retracted and easily
installed with new gaskets.  Or would anyone advise strongly against
these because they might leak also.
-------------
I have had leaks at push rods, and it does result in drips unde the
bus.   It
doesnt have to be high rev to drip either.  i did fix it like how you
said,
my puling the rocker arms and the appropriate push rods, mangling the
old
PRTube out of there, installing a two part tube ( I used the ones with
lock
nuts) with new seals, and putting the PR and rocker arm back on
(remember to
readjust valves in a few 100 miles)     if it is oily unde rthe prtube
ends
after you wash the motor and you can tell it is oozing, then it leaks
there,
but when they leak they drip
..................
I know the engine doesn't burn
oil because it never has and I had a compression test.  This was
noticed only recent.  And there's no way to know for sure where all my
oil is going...
It also seems to smell gas on start up.  After its been driven after 5
min the smell is gone.  The Gas smell doesn't seem to be acumulating
in the luggage compartment where the tank is.  My best bet is the fuel
lines underneath the luggage compartment where the electric fuel pump
and filter are.  My question is, if the connections or lines have been
leaking only under pressure wouldn't it smell of gas constantly at low
speeds around the city?  Why should it clear up after a few minutes.
--------
do check all you gas lines from the tank to the carb and see if any
are
oozing wet or if the are visably cracked.   Replace is bad.   some
will say
replace if in doubt.    Also check to make sure you have a grommet
where the
metal line goes through the tin forward (towards the nose of the bus)
of the
fan shroud, and that the line has not worned through on the tin, as
that can
happen and have gas leak there.

also, do you regularly fill the bus before going home?   if so it may
be that
the gas in the tank expands as the above ground temp tends to be
warmer than
the underground gas station tanks temps .  If I park right after
filling up I
tend to smell gas when i go back to the bus, so I try not to or with
the tank
filler side uphill.   Driving about 5 or 6 miles home seems to be
enough for
me that I dont smell gas after a fill up.

luggage compartment?  what? -  oh is this a bug?   what make and model
VW is
this?
