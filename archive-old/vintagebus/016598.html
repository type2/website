Hello everyone,

Tonight I got out the wire wheel and got rid of the nasty rattle can gold 
paint on my dashboard.  Ahh, feeling much better.  I was also able to fix up 
the radio hole in the dash.  PO (the bondo king) had made the hole a bit 
bigger by cutting a couple of slits on the left and right sides and then 
folding the metal back out of the way.  Since he/she didn't cut it all away, 
I was able to &quot;unfold&quot; the pieces back into place, a little welding to fill 
in the hacksaw tracks, and voila!

On a more serious note, I also started looking closely at the lower forward 
cargo door post.  It has been smacked in at one point, not bad enough that 
the doors are out of alignment too bad, but it is rusting from behind pretty 
bad which will prevent me from trying to whack it back into shape.  Has 
anyone ever replaced that section before?  I'm looking at having to cut away 
that pillar from about the level of where the top of the dogleg (cab floor 
sill) meets the pillar, and down.  Since I will be replacing the rockers 
anyway, I will be cutting in that area anyway.  the thing that has me 
nervous is that the pillar is a structural member, and that the lower cargo 
door hinge hooks onto it, making it a potentially high stress area.  There 
is a bus in a junkyard that I know of that I could get the section from, so 
that is not a problem.  Does anyone know how complicated that joint is once 
you get inside?  It looks to me like the pillar, cargo floor, and rear 
bulkhead from the front seat section all come together there.  eek!

To give context, my welding experience to this point involves welding in a 
cab floor section, a battery tray, and a new lower hinge section on one of 
my cab doors.  Not an expert, but always learning.
Advice? warnings?

Thanks!
