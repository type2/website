Subject: fixed my drivers door not opening from outside :)
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.10.10004211102370.30514-100000_at_users.anet-stl_dot_com&gt;

hi all,

My drivers door wouldnt open from the outside, nor would it latched
completely shut, so i took the door apart.

The lath thing was broken :(  the part that screws to the door had
separated from the rest of the latch, allowing the latch mechanism to move
around in teh door. (applies to pre 64 flip handle doors)

so... i decided to weld it back together.  I read on the r.a.m.v.a
newsgroup about fusion welding with a gas welder, and that seemed the best
way to do it, as i didnt want to have big globs of weld on there to grind
back off.

so, i put the two pieces in a vise so that they mated back up perfectly,
and put my smallest tip on my welder, got a good hot flame and melted the
pieces back together with no filler rod.  WOW that was fun.  I love
learning new stuff. Just heating it up till it all fused back into one
piece.  I put a couple of tacks with a filler rod on the sides for some
extra reinforcement... and bolted it back in.

The door almost worked perfectly, but i had to bend the thingamabob on the
drivers door handle that hooks into the door latch, now it works as new.

So, if your drivers door wont shut completely and the handle wont work
right, perhaps a good idea is to check and see if the inner latching
mechanism is busted.. (assuming you have a flip handle bus)

take care,

Steve
