The rope is to help keep the bar centered.  The tow bar is kinda narrow, I
don't know why it was built that way.  I'm thinking of modifying it so that
it extends to the edges of the beam.   I think this would help make it more
stable, and give the towed vehicle less of a mechanical advantage over the
tow bar.

&gt;&gt; I dragged the '55 single cab out of the back yard, bolted up the tow bar,
&gt;&gt; hitch it up to the '60, and too it all for a spin.
