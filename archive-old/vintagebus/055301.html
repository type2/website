Subject: Re: [VB] clunking sound from fan - found it!

I had put the lockwasher before the special nut on backwards, and thus it
appeared tight when I first did it, but after much vibration, the washer
came loose, and fan was able to jiggle ever so slightly.  My new record for
pulling and reinstalling engine - 5hours 47 minutes(With the help of my Dad
who acted as surgeon's assistant).  .  Slow and steady wins the race :)  I
do need a new generator pulley though, I ruined mine trying to get at all
this with the motor still in.  Many thanks to all who replied, hope I can
help you out someday.
