Well everyone, the last of parts from Barrett Ent. came today.  Funny how
the first thing I needed ended up being the last to arrive.  If I had to
order all this stuff again and was on a tight budget, I would order from
them however, I was not impressed with the packing on the backordered items.
The lifters, heads, cam, cam bearings, and a few other assorted items
arrived in 3 boxes and were packed very well.  The rods and crank however
were shipped with absolutely no packing and dumped in a bare cardboard box.
I'm very lucky this stuff wasn't damaged.  There doesn't appear to be any
dents or dings but I'm still shocked at how the parts were just dumped in a
box and sent out!!! YIKES!

My heads have been opened up for the larger cylinders and semi-hemi cut by
Frank Musil in Lincoln, NE - his price is right on as well.  I hear he's got
a very good reputation in Lincoln.  This weekend I'm going to pick up the
heads and have him finish 8 doweling the flywheel to match the crank.  I
measured the crank with a set of dial calipers and it's definitely a ten/ten
grind like they said it would be.  It's a stock VW crank that has the
weights welded on to it - pretty much a work of art!

The other thing that I know I'll probably regret is that Painter's Grinding
in Denver sent back my T3 engine case and gave me the specs of .60/.80 -
WOW!  I told them not to bother maching the case if they thought it was not
a good candidate for the rebuild.  The guy told me on the phone to PLEASE
have it thoroughly balanced (which I will) because this is the case's last
rebuild.  After the saddles are hammered out, that will be the end of it.  I
know it's marginal but I'm so far in the hole for all of this it ain't even
funny.

So there you have it - my first lousy attempt at an engine rebuild.  I'm
gonna get the cores ready to ship back
