&gt; I wonder what Vw dealers charged ( how many hours) to change a generator.
&gt; 1 hour?
&gt;  11/2?
&gt; 2 hours tops ?! That's if the mechanic stopped for a frankfurter.
&gt;         just curious,
&gt; 
Current shop time as per Mitchel shop rates are 1.5 hrs to r and r
generator, 1.5 hrs to r and r engine in upright engined vehicle, bug or
bus. 
The shop I worked at always did the gen in the vehicle as per dworkin. I
personally have always pulled the engine.
