This is my first time pulling a bus suspension apart.  I'm not sure how to
tell the condition.  There is no obvious damage, and no discernable play
in any of the pieces.

I think my next move will be to clean everything up; what's a good cleaner
to use that *won't* eat up the rubber seals, in case I decide not to 
rip everything apart right now?
--- -- - - - 
i just dont soak any rubber parts in sovent if I can avoid it.  A solvent 
tank is nice for cleaning parts (knock the dried grease and dirt chunks off 
first) but barring that you can get by with primitive methods.  Like I have 
been using carb clean in a can to clean out the engine case for a motor I am 
building (very low miles, but it caught on fire and stuff fell into the 
motor- its a newer case with the plastic cam plug-  when dd they start using 
those?)   or after getting the crust off with a screwdriver/wire brush, you 
can spray it all with simpe green (much nicer on you than toxic chemmies, and 
it does cut the grease)  Anyway, are the link pins rusted with pits?   are 
they worky in the bushes?    should fit snug , not have ovalled area.   like 
the needle bearing s in the later front ends, a lot of times they just fall 
aprt when removed, thats bad.     Do you have  a bd workshop manual?   it is 
pretty much the same procedure as in the 63 manual, same way to adjust link 
pins, set the shims,  remove stuff, .   You just want the pins to fit nicely, 
if they can wiggle back and forth then so will your wheel.    simpe and 
straightforward.  then just clean, reassemble, and grease.  Or you can get 
stuff powdercoated .  what ever.

I did manage to split the torsion springs on the driver's side.  I'm 
*assuming* I can clean them up and tack them back together with the MIG.
Failing that, are the springs themselves the same as a '60?  I have 2 
'60 beams on tap.  Hmm.  Maybe I should swap in the trailing arms - cheaper
and slightly better brakes...
- - - - - - 
splitting the torsion leaves is no big deal, that spot weld just makes them 
easier to install.   No I dont believe the springs are the same as a later 
bus, and there are a different number of them.    You can check this yourself 
in the online parts list, if you dont have a hard copy.   I have heard you 
can swap the trailling arms and us ethe 3/55- 63 style spindles/brakes on 
there.       I left mine stock, and my 69 beetle has the same size and number 
of wheel cylinders (use same rebuild kits for front) and the bug has larger 
brake shoes.  hooray!!!  I wouldn't change anythig like that on mine, but 
then again is is low milage and very  solid and original, even if somepeople 
can't see past the lack of shiny paint.  Acid rain is bad for you bus.  and 
the paint quality of the paint they used n teh standard in 53- I can rub the 
paint off wth a rag in the engine compartment -   I think it is very 
sensitive to chemmies, the interior paint is fine.
-  -- -  -- - --

I woulda just greased it and driven it, if the rest of the car was
driveable.  I think I could have gotten away with greasing it and
driving it to loosen up the trailing arms.  Oh well.

ya- but you are probably doing a better job than me.   I get lazy and just 
tend to throw grease at things.  usually it works though

&gt; well, how bad are the king/link pins?   you can still get new link pins- 
same 
&gt; as for through 63,  dont know about getting new king pins though, but if 
they 
&gt; are real bad you could ge them rebuilt.   But if you clean up the bits and 
&gt; see what shape they are in- that is what I would do if I was you, now all 
the 
&gt; bits are out.
