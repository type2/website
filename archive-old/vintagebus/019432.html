I've always taken a piece of wire and threaded it into the seam; then you tighten
the wire and take up the slack - then you bend the tabs.

&gt; I'm in the process of recovering the bare seat frames in my '67.  I've put 
&gt; the old twiggy seat pads back on and added some cotton sheets on top to 
&gt; strengthen and cushion them.  I received the stock mesh platinum seat cover 
&gt; set from Wolfsburg West and am starting to put them on.
&gt; Now, my question.  When putting these coveres on, they don't fit &quot;tight.&quot;  
&gt; I've noticed there are little hooks on the under side of the seat frame.  
&gt; The thing is, on the old upholstery, these hooks were used to wrap around a 
&gt; metal rod that was sewn into the stock seat covers.  The seat covers I have 
&gt; don't have this rod in them.  How can I get these things to stay on tight?  
&gt; Anyone have any experience with this?
