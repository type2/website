Wow! Thanks to the pros with the help on the Porsche parts I have layin'
around. The real amazing thing is the off-hand remark I made about changing my
campmobile back to a normal bus and having free parts. I recieved about a
gazillion (more or less) emails. I live in Charlotte, NC and these parts WILL
BE free. The bus was used to store motorcycle racing tires and engine parts. I
haven't even had time to throw the junk out of it yet (so crowded that I have
never been in bus yet). When I clean it out, my wife may keep a table or two.
The rest will be reposted to this list then, first come-first serve. Thanks!

66' campmobile destined to be a 21 window. (vintage sacriledge?)

p.s. wanted: a too far gone 21 window to rescue and decapitate.
