&gt;What is the story on those reflectors that go above the rear tail lights?
&gt;
The reflectors *below* the rear taillights were used on 55-57 US model
Buses, the ones with the dual filament bubble taillights.

The ones I have for sale at http://www.thesamba_dot_com/forsale are original
post-Barndoor 55s.  Technically, the 2 are not exactly the same, the
diamonds are slightly different, although all markings are exactly the same.
They have a black back, similar to ones installed on Barndoors but are the
post-Barndoor diamond pattern.  Current market puts an NOS set of these at
about $250.  Add NOS dual filament taillights for about another $250 and you
got yourself an expensive rear end that begs Jimmy-Joe-Bob Loser in his
Explorer to hit.  Don't even get me started on a nice, straight ribbed rear
bumper, brackets, splash pans, etc....

Jack Maynard mentioned another type of taillight, he was referring to the
European 55-57 taillights, which are single filament and have a integral
reflector, for use with semaphored Buses.  Current market place on these is
about $200-$250 NOS.
