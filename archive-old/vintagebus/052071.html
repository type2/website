&lt;&lt;  Is the Drag Link Ends just Tie Rod Ends? &lt;&lt;

Hi Dave,
Sort of.  It is a link rod with one tie rod end adjustable and the other 
non-adjustable.

&gt;&gt; I'm right that the Left outer, Tie Rod, and Right Inner are the same?  
R/Outer and Left Inner the Same? &gt;&gt;

Yes, no.  The right side tie rod has non-adjusting tie rod ends.  The left 
tie rod has adjustable tie rod ends so as to allow ajusting it's length.  To 
replace the right side tie rod with one that has adjustable tie rod ends 
risks having the owner and/or mechanic to adjust the front end in such a way 
as to cause the swing lever between the drag link and tie rods to lock up the 
steering due to incorrect geometery!  Much like can happen when some volks 
remove the pitman arm off the steering box and reinstall at a differant angle 
to the drag link instead of just adjusting the drag link!
