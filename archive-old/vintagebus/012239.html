Subject: another new bus pic
Date: Mon, 07 Dec 1998 17:18:26 EST

That picture of the &quot;next&quot; bus is terrible, saw that exact picture of 
the new beetle, the artist must have spent forever morphing that into a 
buslike image. if you want to see something thats pretty allright check 
this out, found it a few months ago.
