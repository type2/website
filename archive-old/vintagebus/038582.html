The knocking seems to be coming from the tranny. It doesn't seem to be
coming from a particular side, so I don't THINK that it is a RG box problem.
Also, I learned today that the sloppy knocking is aparent in 3rd as well
when I let off the gas in low rpm's.  I also wanted to say tranny mounts,
but I don't know enough about tranny problems to rule certain things out.
Tranny mounts came to mind when I thought about a) the shifting got tight,
almost as if the tranny moved forward or to the side a little b) it feels
like the whole rear end is gonna fall off! Like maybe everything is behind
held together by a single bolt. Of course i'm no mechanic, so I have no clue
what my real problem is.  Thanks in advance.
