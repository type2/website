Subject: Removed my front beam

After all my questions during the week I put my new found knowledge to work
today.

I heated up the shift coupling screw until it was red hot - it came straight
out much to my surprise.  Then I went to remove the front shift rod,
couldn't get it out as my bus is a 66 one so does not have the removable
front plate.  I could nearly get it out, but not quite.  Then I remembered I
had pulled the gearbox out of third, popped it back into either first or
third using the rear ror and I could then wiggle the front rod free.

Then it was the turn of the front roll bar, the clips came off with ease
with a cutting disc - they were very solidly rusted.  Then I could remove
the torsion arms.

Then came the time to remove the beam - enlisted the help of 3 friends as I
was expecting it to try to fall off.  No such luck - it didn't budge at all.
After hitting it simultaneously on both bump stops, after about 15 mins we
managed to get it to drop off.  I think I have whoever the sprayed the
underseal on for that.  Have got to scrape all of that off next as its
cracking and peeling off in places - a nice water trap.

When I came to look at the beam I noticed a small hole in one of the shock
towers.  I took a mule skinner to the area and I have ended up with a hole
like this:

Is it safe to weld this?  What method should I use to weld it - I can't just
patch it as then I wont get the beam back in.

Next job is to finish stripping out the front end so I can scrape it, clean
it, POR15 it and then spray the underbody shutz on.  Should be fun!  Also
got to work out why someone has cut and rewelded part of the clutch pedal
assembly on at an angle - its RHD though so I think I am going to have to
investigate others buses!

Thanks for all the help
Paul
