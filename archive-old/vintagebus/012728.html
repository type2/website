&gt; Has anyone thought about using scratch and abrasion resistant
plexiglass or
&gt; lexan to replace a windshield?  Lexan (if thick enough) will stop a
bullet.

Plexiglas acrylic and Lexan polycarbonate are commonly used in
aircraft and motorcycle glazing.  It should work fine if you know how
to clean it properly.  Even the scratch-resistant stuff isn't nearly
as scratch-resistant as glass.  I don't know how well plastics will
hold up under the windshield wipers, either.

Of course, if you car must be inspected, they might frown upon
anything but the stock glass.
