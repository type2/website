&lt;&lt;  Will low battery voltage make my generator light on?&gt;&gt;
Hi Michael,
No.

&lt;&lt; My pulley broke on the freeway last night.  After I replaced it I found 
that the generator light didn't come off.  Can anybody help me out?  &gt;&gt;
Check all your connection to generator/regulator/battery.  Also check the 
brushes in the generator to make sure they are longer than the cages they are 
in.  If they are the same length or shorter replace!  Lastly your brushes may 
have been soaked by oil.  We had the same thing happen to us after instaling 
a used generator that must have previously been on a engine with an oil 
problem.  After using a finger nail cardboard sandpaper/file to clean the 
commutator (With engine running!) that the brushes ride on several times 
which would work for a couple of weeks each time we finally removed the 
brushes and soaked out the oil out of them with gasolene.  Which seems to 
have solved the problem.   Eric&amp;Barb
