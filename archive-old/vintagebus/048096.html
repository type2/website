replacing these shift bushing does make a very noticable difference.  even 
just the front most one,   do be casreful taking the shift linage apart in 
the middle , the screw/connection can be a bear- soak with penetrating oil.

&gt;  
&gt;  Hi Rex,
&gt;  First do take all of the shifter apart to clean and grease all moving 
parts. 
&gt;  
&gt;  Replace the forward shift bushing if you have a 59 or 60 and later bus.  
&gt; When 
&gt;  you take out both the engine a tranny do take out the rear shift rod out 
the 
&gt; 
&gt;  rear of the bus and replace both rear shift bushings clean and regrease 
the 
&gt;  rear shift tube and replace any torn dust boots on either end of this tube.
&gt;  To adjust the shifter you need to make sure the reverse lock out plate is 
in 
&gt; 
&gt;  it's proper position.  Do check the shop manual for this position, but 
from
