TOTALLY!
A point those people who claim to know so much about
their pets &amp; for that matter ALL dogs miss all the
time.
How differently does your dog act when you have
visitors over?
Generally quite a bit, depending on the person.
Now imagine you have about 200 or 300 visitors over
for a party....AND they all bring their buses.
Total over stimulation and disorientation since a
dog's hearing &amp; smell is far more acute than our own &amp;
of course they're mostly at knee height.
If it was happening at your place you'd probably leave
the dog at a friend's place or put it into a kennel
for the day.
Add to that the fact that your dog may've travelled
for a couple of hours in your bus to get there &amp; is
now stir crazy.
  
&gt; They are a little too young to travel, but the real
&gt; reason was because of all the other bad dogs and
&gt; owners that always tend be present at campouts. 
It's sad, but it's the dummies that ruin it for
everyone.
Oh, for better owners.
Maybe you should start a new club, Sean.
Good Busses &amp; Good Dogs.
That way you can filter you membership &amp; avoid the bad
ones.
And on that note, I think I'll don my flame-proof
suit.........
:o)
Cheers &amp; God Bless
