Subject: RE: [VB] Re: Rebuilt Spindles and Center Pin!

Greetings,

&gt;Spindles are on, everything seems good, very tight....link pins accepted
&gt;grease through the nipples readily, but the king pins are so tight that I
&gt;can't get any grease to go in....should I worry?

Yep - they should be 'loose' enough to accept grease and squirt.
Are you sure you got the grease holes in the new bushes lined up OK
- it's easy to miss this (or did you remember to drill em if they're 
the fairly commonly available undrilled replacement bushes...).

&gt;1.  The reamer runs into the shift rod before getting all the way through.
&gt;Is this normal?  Should I remove the rod?

Yep!

&gt;With the center pin kit, there is a small white rubber O-ring.  Not
&gt;mentioned anywhere, and the old assembly did not have one.  Where does it
&gt;go?

Not the plastic bush that goes on top (fairly big)?

regards

RobK
