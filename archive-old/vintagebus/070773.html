Subject: Re: [VB] Tranny question

Here is the fulcrum plate:

______
|          |
|          |   &lt;- wear all along the flat side
|          |        of this edge
|_____|

Talked to Rick Long today. He's never seen it but he said he suspected a
cracked side gear. He said that, depending on where the crack is in the
gear, it might cause the FP's to bind the axle at the worn area.

Good tip about the reverse effect of the RGB's. Thanks!

If you lay a straight edge on the FPs flat side and there are grooves, then
personally I'd try to find some that are better.   I don't know what you
mean about the front to back orientation.   As the axles spin, the FPs spin
with them, constantly rotating about their middles.   often they get worn on
one end of the flat side.   likewise the axle spades get worn on one half of
the face, and you can swap them side to side to use the un worn face as the
forward face.   You can also see if this has already been done.   I
recommend putting a straight edge to the axle spade and checking for grooves
and wear.

I have been buying bus axles and rgbs when I find them cheap just to have a
supply of crown gears, fps and decent axles.  most are worn.  bugs use the
same crown gears and fps, and they are in MUCH better shape when they have
been in a bug.  store them greasy so they dont rust.

 The axles spin the way you think they don't.   think about the way the
wheel turns, then realise the RGears mean the axle spins the other.

I'm putting an old center section in my bus that I've had laying around. The
fulcrum plates I'm putting in it have some wear on one side (the long flat
side running from front to back of the car, not the short side where I would
expect it). I was going flip them putting them back in. Which side gets the
wear, the long side facing the RGB or the side facing the pinion?
