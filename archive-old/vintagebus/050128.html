Subject: Repost: &quot;Rescue from Purgatory&quot; by Joe Fournier


[Interregnum: Joe has been after me to find this message for some time
because he lost it and wants to send it to National Geographic or
somewhere. 8) Tonight it got easy because a beta of the new Busted Bus
search came on-line, so I pulled it up for him. I had forgotten how rich
and good and excessive this message is so I'm sending it round again
because modest Joe never would think to post it twice. I think this is
right up there with the Grendel saga and that delectable story about
&quot;mating the case&quot;.

By way of fore-afterword, the bus in question now belongs to the Chad
Cantwell I mentioned yesterday, having been smartly restored by the
irrepressible Josh Rodgers. I saw it last weekend, it is in two-tone primer
(I don't know where they got white primer but it's a two-color pre-paint
job) with its body proud and straight and its interior well and cleanly
appointed. It takes Chad &amp; girlfriend camping most weekends and now lives a
noble life as a working bus. --KH]


Every one of them was a sinner. That's what brought them here into the hands
of the gatekeeper. For many there would be no redemption, only a slow,
agonizing death. No advocate would come to extol their virtues and overlook
their blemishes. No champion would come to save them from elements. In
unison they cry &quot;pray for us sinners now and in the hour of our rust.&quot;

In the back, two Beetles lay with their backs to the earth, gutted to make
dune buggies that would haul dead deer from deep, dark woods. Once proud to
carry people into their places in industry; now they were relegated to
seasonal work in the killing fields. One shell looked on, wondering if it
would become a receptacle for spent metal and rust as it's cousin had become
already. It really didn't matter. In some ways, it was a kinder fate, to
rust away quickly instead of baking, baking in the stiff Arkansas sweat
called &quot;Summer.&quot; Each morning the dew would come, just wetting, not
quenching. Each noon the sun would try to make glass from the sand. They
ought to call it &quot;Simmer.&quot;

Just past the beetles sank a colossus. Looking more like an overgrown
splitty than any of our modern notions of mass transit buses, this beast
must have been a wonder in its day. I could only imagine the vintage. Late
40's? Early 50's. Surely nothing like this was ever seen running by my own
eyes, but they have only been open in this world since 1960. We searched
forward and aft and could not find its powerplant. Only upon inspecting a
midsection that was suspect as a luggage hold, it revealed what might have
been the heart of a locomotive. Our hearts raced with excitement at the
discovery of such a massive engine--a mid-engine deisel bus! But slowly came
the sinking sadness of knowing that this icon would run no more. And the
wind echoed our very thoughts: &quot;it will run no more.&quot;

Three of us made the journey at great peril to our own souls, for to be
trapped in this place would be a fate worthy of our darkest images. Even the
people who lived nearby seemed affected, their destinies wrapped up and
delivered into the hands of the gatekeeper. Though the doors were all closed
and bolted, still they came. &quot;Have you seen him?&quot; &quot;Is he here?&quot; &quot;Has he
fixed my precious?&quot; Their pleas were ever desparate, some coming by every 20
minutes or so, in feeble search for the gatekeeper. He must have known his
place among them. For they sat, some for as long as an hour, at the mouth of
the cemetary just across the street. To these people, Ken, myself, and Ken's
wife Erin must have seemed among the bravest people in the world. For here
we were, strangers, defying the gatekeepers status as the only one who could
save these lost souls.

In fairness, the gatekeeper is a good man. A welder by trade, he tries to
save the ones he can, but many that come don't make the trip out. I am sure
he would be proud to see us persevering. I am not sure how he feels about
the watchers.

Ken and Erin met the '67 Westy for the first time. She took a liking to them
almost immediately and it's a good thing too. For it was Ken, guided by his
memory of the writings of Bob Hoover, who later solved the timing problem
that would have surely kept her stranded there, in Purgatory.

As the watchers pretended to talk to each other, we fastening up the link
arm in minutes and without pause moved on to the other essential tasks.

The oil bath filter must have had the original dirt in it from the bus'
first trip, thirty years and 52740 miles ago. Maybe that's why the
gatekeeper left it off, stuck in the corner of the engine compartment in a
stack of acorns. A rag was tossed in to catch any drips. Some mountain troll
had snuck in one night and plugged a vacuum line in the 34PICT3 with a
sliver from a match stick. Then he plugged back up the advance line from the
distributor. &quot;Why would he do that?&quot; Ken asked. I don't know...maybe it's
just a troll thang.

Years back, the gatekeeper had taken pity on the old bus. He pulled her
tired 1500cc and carefully crafted a new, more powerful 1600 for her. He
even installed new engine seals. He pushed the 1500 into a far corner of the
shop. The smoke from this engine would be use to repel insects as his dune
buggy ventured off into places VW never intended it to go. I know that he
started her month after month for some years, but somewhere along the line,
the old bus must have fallen out of favor with the gatekeeper. She must have
sat lonely for some time, longing for attention. Now, as we gently went
about our healing work, her front turn signals seemed to perk up, ever so
slightly.

The mavericks pressed on as the locals watched from across the street. &quot;Why
they even have their own tools,&quot; I thought I heard one whisper.

Fuel lines didn't appear bad, but the rescue crew replaced them anyway. All
could be lost if one of these failed. The new fuel filter had been
forgotten, but compressed air helped improve the stained filter that
protected the engine from a 30 year old gas tank. The acorns, rags, and dirt
were removed. A battery was place in its hold. Fingers were crossed and the
key was turned. A quickly slowing crank revealed a critical problem. I had
checked the battery with a volt meter the night before and decided 12 volts
would be good enough. &quot;Twelve volts, zero amps,&quot; Ken reminded me. A push to
an open spot, a jump from the trusty Buick (a good car born to the wrong
family), and the soul of the Westy resonated across the mountain. The
onlookers at the cemetary scattered, fearing reprisals from the gatekeeper
for these wild ones who would save a soul without his oversight. But the
gatekeeper would be proud. He could not save them all. It was only right
that others would come to take them away. Some to Heaven; some to Hell.

Ever notice how, over time, things we don't have become more attractive. We
notice the flaws in the things we do have, but we can overlook them in other
people's stuff. It grieves me to say that I too am victim to this kind of
thinking. Six months ago I saw a single cab with gates that the gatekeeper
told me he'd sell for 2 or 3 hundred dollars. I told Ken about that single
cab and he decided he wanted it. Somehow, however, my mind reconstructed the
gates into perfect, rustless riggings. I remembered this single cab as a
solid truck with surface rust. Maybe someone sprayed it with fertilizer...
that would allow holes to emerge throughout the truck in a mere six months.
Wouldn't it? Alas, one was left behind in Purgatory, a brown 62 single cab,
suffering a slow, tortuous death with it's kinsman, a white 62 single cab
that the gatekeeper says he will fix one day. A glimpse across the yard
tells a different story. In ten years both Ken and I will look back and wish
we'd saved it, but in ten years, you'll be able to pick this one up with a
magnet and a bucket.

A trip to the gatekeeper's home place (a house he built, powered by his own
generator) led us to a donor bus who had already given up the ghost. Seven
or eight snake skins littered her floor like worms working her into the
earth. Cancer crowned her roof firmly and worked her way up her sides. From
her body we took lenses, an engine lid and a gas door with churchkey
devices, an interior light, a spare cargo door handle, the european lens
cover, From the parts stash inside we retrieved a couple carburators and air
cleaners to save the lives of other splitties. I will return in the fall for
the splitty transmissions and the original 1500 from my 67 Westy. I will
bring an engine and parts in trade. And beer. But when I attempt to retreive
the transmissions, I will be afraid of the snakes that call this once proud
split their home. I will use bars and gloves and hooks and prayers.

We arrived in Snowball, Arkansas around 10:30 am. The trip, including a stop
for breakfast took us right at 5 1/2 hours. We left from Rick's yard around
5:00 pm.

ELECTRICS. Six months ago, all the electrics seemed to work fine, but as the
journey would prove, a couple snows and nature left to its own devices, and
natural curcuit breakers will appear, preventing lights, ignition, and turn
signals. And somewhere in the system, some dangling wire or broken cable
robbed power with the bumping of the road. It took over 10 hours to travel
the 300 miles from Snowball to Memphis. There was a stop for pizza in
Marshall that left us in the parking lot for 30 minutes trying to regain
ignition and general system power (corrosion at the starter) then headlights
(corrosion at the light switch). There were stops for coffee, and one to
ward off sleep. The intermittent power loss (of not fully understood origin,
though most certainly electrical) cost us at least an hour with various
stops, driver swaps, and brain activity that could be picked up on shortwave
in Oregon.

Safe at home. I spent the morning attending to my wife who is (as is Ken's
wife) sainted in her own right. The rest of the day I spent surveying the
bus and assessing the work I have ahead of me. We have made the trip out of
Purgatory and have stepped onto the path of righteousness.

She started life as the mistress of a single man named James Brown. He took
her down to Mexico where she lost her tent to windy weather. After that, a
kind hippie took her in and tried to love her, but he was always too broke
to keep her in new brake shoes. In her life with Rick, she was one of many
vehicles. He was kind, but he never really loved her, and his time was so
stretched out that she was lucky to get a glimpse. Once Rick tried to trade
her for a Karman Ghia, but she wound up losing her roof rack and bumper in
that deal, with nothing to show for it.

Now she is part of a family. We'll take care of her; she'll take care of us.
We'll mend her wings when they're broken and she'll take us on flights
through a world of adventure. There will be new floors at the feet of the
driver and passenger. There will be new rockers and a half section of cargo
floor. Sandblasting, paint, tires, window seals. With less than 1000 miles
on the engine and 53,000 on the rest of the bus, she will be able to travel
proudly as I work to the wounds of neglect. She is again in the world of the
living and shining with a glow not seen since her youth. There will be
parties and fishing trips and VW shows and swap meets, mountains, beaches,
and flat, grassy stretches spattered with wild flowers. There will be
children laughing, people crying, and fast-pressed brakes that will make her
heart skip a beat. She has made the trip out of purgatory and begun a new
journey. Where it will take her, only Heaven knows.

I can't thank Ken enough for his help. Without him, I would have had to
trailer this bus to Memphis, which would have delayed its retrieval another
month or two. His bus wisdom is exceeded only by his kindness and
generosity. If you break down near Memphis and need a ride to the parts
store, call me; if you need help troubleshooting, call Ken. ;) Joe
