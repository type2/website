Subject: Kadron Kwestion

Hi Jaime,

Funny you should ask, I took my Kadrons off this weekend and put on the
stock dual port manifold and Brazilian 30/31 PICT with adapter and
vacuum advance distributer with Compu-fire ignition. ( I am still
running the single quiet muffler system at least until winter). 

The butterfly shafts on the Kadrons need to be rebushed. ( I kept them
oiled, but they're made of plastic I've been told) I don't like the
linkage, it has popped off on me a few times, and they kill most of the
bottom end torque on my engine. Plus, when the engine is warm, it takes
a few cranks to get the engine to start, and intake noise is increased a
great deal with the Kadrons. I do like the Kadrons in winter, I never
have had a problem starting or icing up.

I lost out on some acceleration, but the stock carb is a lot smoother,
my bottom end torque is back, I like the quiet running and even with the
95 - 100 degree we have had so far the engine starts instantly every
time and doesn't run on when shut down.  

Sometimes stock is better!
