Subject: Slightly Off Topic

Okay... 1962 15-window bus, restorable, with just about all the bits and 
pieces (not new ones). There are pics but they are unavailable for a few 
days since the owner is out of town. The passenger side RB is bad. Will 
sell, sadly, at essentially what was put out for it which is $3K. Located in 
NE SF Bay area. I need to go back off-list so contact at this email ID if 
interested.

Also have 1964 parts bug which had been restored a couple years back but was 
hit by a red light runner (front end) which I will unload at a very good 
price as is.

Staffan
