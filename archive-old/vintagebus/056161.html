Subject: RE: [VB] Only you can prevent engine fires

Yesterday I worked on my 65 deluxe 21 window all day and I pulled the
engine to find an oil leak. Well I pulled the engine and to my surprise
here is a fuel line that the PO hadn't touched since the beginning of
life for this bus. I am glad the oil leak and bad clutch made me pull
the engine. The fuel line didn't have any clamps on it (Holy SH#$) and
had mushroomed away from the inline fuel filter they had put in. Once
this thing is on the road I am going to get a fire extinguisher ASAP!

PS: I found the leak (Oil Cooler) and replaced the clutch. Now the bus
is running and moving forward getting closer and closer to the road
again.

&gt; Thanks for the advice Matt.  People usually don't buy a fire
extinguisher
&gt; for their car until they have already had a fire.
&gt;
&gt; While we're on the subject, does anyone know if a fire extinguisher
needs to
&gt; be recharged or whatever they do to them?  Does the stuff in them go
bad?

Dry chemical extinguishers need to be recharged every two or three
years.
Take them out of their bracket now and then and give them an inverted
shake to keep the powder loose.
