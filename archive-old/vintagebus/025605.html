Kyle, All,
	After WW2 there was a great out migration of highly trained technical
people from Germany.  Some of the &quot;cleanest&quot; (less Nazi) came to Canada
and many more of the questionable ones went to OZ, Brazil, Mexico and
South Africa.  Could be that VW offered an outlet for their technical
wizardry, and that, &quot;right on&quot;!, air intakes were a snap for them after
dealing with the Africa Corp.  Of course, the bad Nazis came to the US
and the Soviet Union to make the Cold War interesting.  My mother-inlaw
often talks about when she met Hitler as in teen in Hitler Youth and it
make me think about all of horror Germany gave to the world this
century.  Damn right those Aussie buses should have the &quot;scoops&quot; in a
useful place!  The 20th Century has paid for it.  Gary Gibson
