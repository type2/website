Subject: Electrical Problem

I have an electrical problem, can anybody offer any remedies. 

These are the symptons: When I switch on the ignition I get the gas gauge lighted up, everythig elsae works normal; when I pull the headlight switch knob out(this is with the ignitin switched off) I get the oil pressure and generator lights lighted on the speedo, and I get the gas gauge lighted; With the engine running I can pull out the headlight switch knob (at this point everything is working OK) and then turn off the ignition but the engine keeps running, the engine will quit when I push in the headlight switch knob; the drivers side turn signal works fine but the pass side turn signal flashes very slowly.I have swapped out both the ignitin switch and the headlight switch but get the same symptons. Any ideas anybody???
