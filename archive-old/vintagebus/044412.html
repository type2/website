Subject: Give me air-cooled or give me death.

There has been a flurry of posts regarding VWoA going after anything
and anybody that they think is stepping on their copyright and
trademark toes. From a legal standpoint they have a right to protect
their legal interests and there is little that can or should be done
to stop them. HOWEVER.......there is public relations issue to
consider. Yesterday the type2 list received the following SPAM.

If you follow the link it goes to an ad site for the proposed new
microbus. This tells me that someone at VWoA knows we exist and
thinks that we are a potential market. I am not interested in the
product they offer but I have been considered buying a Jetta  Wagon
for the wife. Based on VWoAs's rabid take no prisoners behavior
toward the air-cooled community I really do not feel too good about
putting any money in their hands.

I cannot imagine the size of the balls that they have to go after
aftermarket suppliers that keep us in parts and then ask us to
consider buying what will certainly be a $30,000 &quot;microbus&quot;

If I wanted so spend $30k on a microbus I would call Lenny at West
Coast Classics and ask him what he had on the lot. I am sure I could
get a really nice 196x 2x window bus for about $30k and I would not
need to worry about going to the dealership for an oil change.

I think it is time to let VWoA knew if they want us to take them
seriously then they should not be harassing everybody in sight for
selling VW mud flaps or having a VW logo on their web site.

If you want to be heard you have to speak up. Go to VWoA web sites and
let em know what you think about them. Perhaps it will not make any
difference but at least we can try.

Have a nice day
