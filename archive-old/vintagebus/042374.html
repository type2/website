&gt; So it is a Sundial, ha? Do you think I should keep it then? I wanted to
&gt; go back to it's original state as a panel but these windows would be

those are the windows sundial installed until around 65 i think.

In 66 and 67 sundial installed windows that look like the ones on
&quot;westies&quot; that bolt into the same size hole in a panel camper.  If you can
find them, that would be your bet.

as for the seats, probably all you need to do is find the originals, and
bolt em in.  Shouldnt be a big deal.  Problem is, they are hard to find as
they rarely get separated from the bus.  When you do find them they are
usually cheap or free.... but it may take some digging around.
