&gt;Actually the crank and apron is found throughout the Brazilian Split

I can't speak for any buses in Brazil, but the 1975 run of Brazilian splits
assembled in South Africa had push-button rear aprons, no crank-start. And
as for the German buses assembled here from 1955 to 1967, I suspect they
followed the same or slightly later changeover. My original 57 kombi has
the crank start, but all the 60s buses I've seen are without.

However, the crank start is &quot;correct&quot; for all splitty production as it
could be retro-fitted as a dealer option in the 1960s according to my VW
tech literature.
