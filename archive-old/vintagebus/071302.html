Subject: Re: [VB] New welder for body work

I have a Lincoln 150. It's a 110 v model. I've had it 8 years and done lots
of projects with it and never had a single problem with it. The only time
I've ever had a splatter problem is when I attach the ground to something
that is not clean bare metal (I like to cheat sometimes if I'm trying to do
something in a hurry).

Lincolns are cheaper than their competition but just as good or better than
anything out there in my opinion. If you are only going to do thin panels, a
250 v. model is overkill.

  Buy an inert gas welder, don't cheap out. I have a Hobart 250 (industrial)
mig welder and just purchased a Miller 175 suitcase mig welder (not as good
as I thought it should be). It seems that the Miller has a weaker grounding
system then my Hobart and I get a lot more splatter from the Miller then the
Hobart (even though Miller now owns Hobart).
