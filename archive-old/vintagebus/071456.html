Subject: Re: [VB] coffee cup holder for vintage bus?

I like that idea, I'll have to see if I can work that out on my bus.  Thanks
for telling us about it.

&gt; Hey Dave,
&gt; On my 63 Double cab, I took one of those plastic
&gt; holders that have a thingy that hangs over the door at
&gt; the base of the window on modern cars and then cut the
&gt; little &quot;L&quot; shape from it, then drilled a hole and put
&gt; it on where one of my door panel screws are: it works
&gt; great!!!
