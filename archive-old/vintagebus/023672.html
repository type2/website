Subject: New Pertronics

At the litchfield show, a friend of mine bought a Pertronics.  Its a
newer model than I
purchased last year (which didn't fit) and is quite a bit smaller than
the older one.

I was wondering if anyone has installed the newer one and how it fits
with standard
aftermarket rotors.

Thanks,
...Markus
