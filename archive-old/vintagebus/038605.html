Well, i just said goodbye to my engine.  Driving down the highway my engine
started dancing to the beat of broken parts thrashin about inside.  Drain
the oil, and out pops a bearing.  Take the gheaders off and no damage there.
Its bad bad bad.
More than likely the block is done, seems a leak sprung and the oil went
dry.  Engine is fully seized now.  Chances are the block is cracked and
rebuild wont be such a great option.  Anyone know of a good block source, or
turnkey engine builder.  Its a 64 with a 1600 in it.  Its not stock.  I
converted it to a 12volt.  If im gonna be replacing I'd like to put
something better than what i had in.  Any suggestions?

Pissed off and sad,

Emmet
