hey list

I am now in the final stages (putting the boots on etc) of redoing my RGB's 
and putting the axles on a ronnie/rancho trans.

My question is how much up and down movement is permissible on the stub 
axles.  If i take the pass side stub axle and gripit in my hand and apply 
downward force i can barely feel and see some movement probably (.3mm), but 
on driver side I can hear it and it moves probably .7-1mm.

In other words i  moved them like how you do when you check to see if your 
bearings are bad in the first place,  but I have no where near the slop i 
had before i replaced the bearings.  The old bearings were totally shot.

I am pretty sure that they are together correctly together because an 
experienced mechanic helped me andd we used the Bentley, Clymer, and Dave 
Easterwood's Neato instructions.

I do not know maybe this is nothing at all but I figured that it would not 
hurt to ask.

thanks alot
domonic
