&gt;Several people have inquired as to how to get their own stickers.


There are other ways, too.  You can capture the logo off the net, stick it
in a file and print it out on clear &quot;stickyback&quot; plastic, or print it on
paper and photocopy it onto stickyback they make for copies.  Might not be
as nice as the one for $35, but it'll be close.

Or am I stepping on legal toes?  Let's make it worse:  I made a vector
version (lines and arcs, like in a drafted drawing on a computer) of the
logo for last year's Auburn Hills Bus Tour tent that Chris Huff (hi, Chris!)
put together.  If anyone wants that, just ask and I'll email it out.  The
advantage of that one is you can scale it up or down infinitely and it won't
get jaggy on you.

My thanks to everyone on the AIRS list.  It's a good thing to have it out
there.
