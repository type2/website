Some trailer shops sale a lock that is similar to the Denver Boot. 
Which is what is described below. One shop that has them is Big Tex 
Trailers in So. Cal.

&gt;Yes, they are.  I saw a RiceBoy Honda with one on at the movies once.

&gt;&gt;  Hey... speaking of which.  The police use a wheel block/locking  mechanism
&gt;&gt;  for vehicles parking illegally and waiting to be towed.... can those be
&gt;&gt;  purchased (at a ridiculous price probably)?  Seems that would be a pretty
&gt;&gt;  intense security device :-) .. and I am not entirely joking.
