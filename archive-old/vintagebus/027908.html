Subject: Dying at speed

My 1600 SP runs great around town.

But, will only run for about 30-45 seconds at full throttle/speed...then
is basically is starving for gas (I assume).  I've changed the fuel
filter (plenty of gas in it...at least at idle) and futzed around with
the carb adjustment.  Timing and wires are all spot on and tight.  The
carb was just rebuilt about 6 months ago and has been running great till
recently...clog??

Any ideas??  I'd like to drive on the freeway again.

Steve
