Hi Bryan,
Sounds strange, but often it really helps to tighten the stuck fastener a 
fraction and then turn to loosen a little.  Repeat this over and over to 
loosen the rust in the threads getting the fastener a little more turned out 
each time.  Until you can get a good amount of oil in between the inner and 
outer threads and away you go!    Eric&amp;Barb
