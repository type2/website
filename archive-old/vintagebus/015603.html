Hello All,

I'm new to both the list, as well as bus enthusiasm,
and I am wondering if there are any Los
Angeles/Southern California based bus organizations. 
Surely there must be and I apologize for any and all
ignorance on my part.  I'm learning more every day
from the list and once I get enough money saved, I'll
buy one of my own babies.

Thanks for your patience with a newbie!
