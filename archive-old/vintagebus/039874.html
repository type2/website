i am thinking aout buying an interior light for my 66 kombi and the guy 
described it to me. my question is, how much do you think that i should 
offer him, or should i not buy it, or does anyone here have a better 
light???

email:
&lt;&lt;I got your first message but I had to check the watts on the bulbs. They 
are 12V/5W. The lense cover has a couple of spots that must have got a 
little warm from the bulbs and it's a little yellow looking. The main 
bulbholder assembly is still pretty decent except the rusted screw that 
holds the power wire. There's enough wire hanging out to splice in with a 
butt connector or?

      Make me an offer.&gt;&gt;

what do you guys think???

cory
66 kombi
