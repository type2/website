Hello all.  I need a bus!  I sold my 59 Panel a few years ago to finance =
some GTI racing parts.  Do you know of any nice Kombi, Standard or =
Deluxes within a days drive from Albuquerque?  There is only one thing I =
am looking for........ the bus must be strait and not need rust repair =
(and must run so I can drive it home:)   I looked at the various &quot;For =
Sale&quot; boards on the net but most of the ads are vintage themselves..  If =
you or someone you know has a nice bus for sale please e-mail me!  =
Thanks.

Benjamin E.
