Subject: free 59 camper
CC: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I just got a free 59 euro camper.  It has been &quot;stored&quot; on blocks in the 
woods outside of Columbia South Carolina since 1983.  It is complete and came 
with a full length roof rack.  
The good points of the bus:
full length rack
euro lights (rear have been updated per euro requirements)
cab area, floor and dog legs are perfect
kph speedo
locking steering column (no key, but in the garage position at least)
tempered front windows for my euro fanatic friend
