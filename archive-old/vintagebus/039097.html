The problem is not you. Microsoft is under a DoS attack from hackers. All of
thier DSN servers are being attacked which makes name resolution for all
microsoft sites impossible. In a nut shell, its not you, its them and they
are working on the fix. If you hammer away and try to get on you may get
lucky and get in. DoS attacks are a pain and not even very respectable in
the hacking community. On the same level as script kiddies.

I know that this isn't Fri but, is anyone else using MSN and having problems
sending to the list?  I had a few questions but had them returned thru the
filter.  I have no idea what I did wrong !!  I'm not that computer savvy to
understand how to change things.
