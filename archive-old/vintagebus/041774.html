&gt; Hey Again, 
&gt;   Another question, should all 4 tires be the same size? Meaning do the
&gt; rear and front tires have to be the same size? Just wondering. Thanks
&gt; again, shawn
&gt; 
Ideally, they should be, unless the vehicle is designed to have dissimilar
tires front and rear, which a bus isn't.  This isn't to say that you can't
run similar sizes
front and rear, such as 185s on the front and 195/75s on the rear, but
stay away from the way kewl 135s on the front wheels.
