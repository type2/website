the &quot;fast start&quot; system to which you refer is a relay,
similar to the one in the current (pun intended) thread
regarding wiring standards, which stems from  the
bus owner who is trying to beef up his headlight circuit.

in this situation, the path of power from the battery to the
ignition switch to the starter solenoid is like 30 feet long,
and the wire is  a small gauge. there is so much
resistance in this circuit that  power is reduced.  the
relay is introduced into the circuit such that  power can be
directly applied from the battery to the starter solenoid, 
via the switching in the relay, and the original ignition
circuitry needs only enough power to drive the relay,
closing the circuit.

your job here is to identify what you have. if you have a 
&quot;bunch of wires&quot; hanging  in the motor compartment, it
could be something as &quot;simple&quot; as an incendiary device
made from radioactive medical waste !!!
