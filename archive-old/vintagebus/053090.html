&gt;The dude i trade my '66 to emailed me and said he was getting NO 
&gt;electricals working anywhere in the bus.  Said he checked the battery
&gt;and it was fine.

&quot;Checking&quot; can mean anything from looking to the right of the engine
to ensure there is still a large black box there to pulling it out
of the Bus and running a full work-up on it.  So find out what he
means by &quot;check&quot;.  I once spent an entertaining afternoon helping
a guy swap out most of the engine electricals on a B**ck and it
finally came back to the battery, which he had already &quot;checked&quot;
and found &quot;ok&quot;.  If I had just looked at it myself first thing,
I could have saved a few hours of dropping starters on my nose.

&gt;So assuming the battery is good and hooked up correctly, what other 
&gt;things are likely to create this complete lack of power?

What Eric&amp;Barb and ronnie said.  For a quick test, make sure the
Bus is in Neutral with the parking brake on and roll under the
back with a screwdriver.  Bridge the two big stud terminals on
the starter solenoid.

If the starter spins reasonably well, the battery and cables are 
at least decent.  One of the stud terminals has a strap that goes
into the starter motor.  The other stud terminal should have three
wires - the positive battery cable, the wire to the generator, and
the wire to the front.  If that's good, start checking at the fuse
box up front.

If the starter doesn't spin at all or spins really slowly, time
to start checking the battery cables, terminal posts, etc.  It
is entirely possible for the positive battery cable to be corroded
out under the insulation but still look fine from the outside.

I hope this helps!
