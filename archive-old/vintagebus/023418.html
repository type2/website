Subject: 36mm Socket find at auto parts store, $12.99

At a generic (non VW) FLAPS I found a 36mm super heavy duty socket at the
price of $12.99.

Here in the Pacific NorthWest it was at _Al's Auto Supply_ (I believe
&quot;Grant&quot; in Oregon?).  Anyway, the company who packages it is in Seattle
given the address printed on it:  Performance Tool.  Part number is &quot;W154&quot;

It is a very heavy black chrome-moly steel tool.  1/2 inch drive, 6 point.
Appears more than suitable for the worst abuse, including impact tools.

I thought worth noting, $12.99 struck me as a good deal for a metric tool.
Lifetime warranty.  Says it is for GM, but clearly should work on those rear
axle nuts 1963 and earlier in the USA.  All Type1's use these too, right?
