Subject: [VB] Re: [T2] VW Boat

&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Don Tuleja&quot; &lt;durocshark_at_gmail_dot_com&gt; 03/09/05 5:15 PM &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Have been offered a blue and white VW boat, fiberglass, fits on the
roof
&gt;&gt; What are they worth ?
&gt;
&gt;VW made boats? Or are you talking a high top like mine?
&gt;

A friend of mine has one.  It's fairly light ansd can easily be lifted

and flipped by him and I.  It's a pretty neat thing.  Coupled with the

camper it's on, it makes a perfect weekend lake getaway 
vehicle.

I think all he's looking for is the outboard motor it came with. Or 
one like it.

So, pick it up.  If you want pictures of it, I'll see...

Paul
