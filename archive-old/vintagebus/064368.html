Subject: Re: [VB] Full-length rack for sale

I have those spring loaded clamps for mine.  What do you mean by lack of
strength?  I've been thinking of putting a piece of plywood on my rack, then
a tent and sleeping up there.  Is the rack going to be able to hold
everything?

&gt; Hi Andrew,
&gt; We are pretty sure it was a USA manufatured rack.  It originally used
spring
&gt; loaded clamps.  One can use hardware store turn buckles to easily make
clamps
&gt; for it.  We had one of those racks and Clara ended up with it.  We did not
&gt; like its lack of strength compared to German manufactured racks, and since
we
&gt; are the official NEATO bus loading champions.....
