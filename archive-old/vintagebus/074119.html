Subject: Re: [VB] Dist Q's

I have always liked running 010's on my buses.  Nice little advance curve....just screams through 1st and 2nd gears.  I ran one on my 1600DP and a 34pict3 setup.  Then again I like to drive balls to the wall in my bus so it stays floored.

The points and whatnot are getting a little tougher to find, so if you get one, keep that in mind when shopping for tune up parts.  BFY always had them along with a few others.  I've got a box full of new points, condensors and rotors, along with about 10 or so old 010's I've gathered through the years.

I switched to a vac. dizzy (205 - I think) and did get a little better gas mileage but the response wasn't as 'crisp' in my opinion.  I consistently got 20-23 mpg with the 010.

&gt; I have a Bosch 010 on my 1600sp now and I like it but I am wondering how it would run with a vacuum adavnce dist. I have a 111-905-205T but would like to try to find a VW 111-905-205L (correct year) as well. 
&gt; I am guessing this might increase my mileage? I have a 30-1 carb.
&gt; 
&gt; Any opinions?
