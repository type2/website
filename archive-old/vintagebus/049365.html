Similarities?

Busism - Nagging belief that non VW people are somehow deficient, but can =
be redeemed when they become bus drivers.=20

Bus-dar - Able to sense the presence of a Type2.=20

Busography - When Albequerque is mentioned, you think of JP,  Nebraska =3D =
NQ &amp; Lafoon, San Francisco =3D UF, etc.

Buscentricity - A non-bus must be thought of in bus terms... Minivans are =
Bus ripoffs, Bugs are just small Buses, houses are big buses without =
wheels, computers were invented to help bus owners,  etc.=20
