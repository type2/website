if you notice a lot of the tools are for tranny's and front end rebuilds which
i doubt most of us have the time /expertise to persue.. mebbe i am wrong

it would be really nice if he could post a relvant pic so that i don't have to
go dust off obscure vw #'s of tools..

m.

I dunno what that tool is, but im assuming he bought it from that &quot;vwtools&quot;
guy..anyone check out his auctions? he must have cleaned out a VW dealership
or somethin. All sorts of crazy VW tools.
Heres a link

I asked this exact question about this exact item listed on this
exact lame-ass auction site about a month ago. I don't remember if
anyone ever came up with an answer. Interesting to see it here again.
