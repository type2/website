I was wondering if anyone has ever repaired the springs on a middle seat
with front seat parts?  I am curious if the 1/3 2/3 front seats used from
63-67 have the same backrest spring assemblies as the 1/3 2/3 full-length
middle seats?  So could I just unclamp the springs from the frame and clamp
them onto my middle seat frames to fix them?  This is the backrests only...

Let me know,
Everett Barnes
