Well, I'm very busy these days but I did finally get my lights all workin' -
whoa.  It's very cold here in central Canada and my bus runs great ..... but
I got to start wearing heavier socks.    Anyway, my current problem (pun on
current) concerns my horn.  It was not working quite right so I took it off
and cleaned up everything last week end.  The horn is a Renault horn the the
PO put on my bus  (the only way I'll ever be able to play a French Horn).
Anyway,  I thought everything was cleaned up alright and I pulled off my
horn button on my steering wheel to check the wiring and now - NO HORN!  So
am I right in assuming that if I have power at the wire inside of the horn
button - that is, the brown wire that comes up through my steering wheel
sparks when it makes contact with metal but the horn doesn't sound - so
since there is power at that wire I would assume that all of my horn wires
are connected properly and that the horn itself is just kaput (I kinda like
that german work, it's like &quot;OK&quot; - people who don't speak english all know
what &quot;OK&quot; means and what &quot;kaput&quot; means ..... but I ramble).  So I guess I
should just track down another horn ..... or could it still be a wiring
problem.

BTW - I do like the sound of that little Renautl horn - it sounds very
appropriate for a bus.

Anyway
