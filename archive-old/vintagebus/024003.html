Well,

All i say is that more HP is costly.  I thought that 20mpg was bad.  I
know that i am getting much worse now.  I am doing a check on this next
tank.  I will post what it is.  I am also finding that i will have to
stock up on Marvel Mystery Oil.  I already went through a bottle full.
I am going to recheck the setting and make sure it is right.

I also have found that you definatly need the Blower support bracket.  I
have a nice bare area on the inside of my deck lid.  Every time i
accelerate, the unit flexis forward and hit's the lid.  Makes a real
nice rattle.

Otherwise, i made it to work and back.  I will keep you all posted on
how things go.

Matthew
