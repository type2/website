I thought I'd send an update, since I haven't written in for quite a
while.  

First the big news: As of Dec 23rd, I am the proud owner of a 1963 23
window deluxe that I got off the list(from a fellow listee).  I've got a
number of pics of it from both when I first got in and when I've begun
some minor work on it before it was stashed away in a warmer climate for
the winter.  I will have those posted to Thoms sight or my own makeshift
sight soon.  Yea for me! 

My 64 21 window is, alas, no more.  There wasn't a chance in hell that the
bus would have ever been correctly resto'ed.  I was living in a pipe dream
because it was my first bus and I was so young when I got it(15yrs old!)
When I finally made my mind up to do away with it, it was like a mother
losing a child.  So, my loss is your gain cause I've now got a bus with
nice tidbits of sheetmetal that you  may or may not need.  Some parts are
gone: the nose, corners, and sunroof hole, but others remain(like a great
divider wall bulkhead and uncut dash).  ALSO, How in the heck does one
take off the BRL(=Big Red Light) that is on the left had side of the dash
board?  Does it turn and twist off? Unscrew?  I have no idea whatsoever
and the Bentley, from what I can tell, doesn't mention a thing about it.  
Help!  Luckely when I got the bus back in the day it was when no one gave
a crap about busses and it remained largly in tact with all the correct
gear in it.  So I got a lot of stuff off it.  If it wasn't totally rusted
out in the oddest of places then...ahh!!

Finally, the 1963 std sunroof:  A boat load of work has been underway with
this one since 1998.  For the guy who wanted to know if the Belly Pans
helped or didn't help, I would have to say it depends on the location.  My
two busses with Bellys(that I have gotten into) where so fully of crap
that it just rusted from the inside out.  It ends up hurting the frame, of
course.  On the 63, over the break, I took out the rocker panel that
had some bondo and a zillion pinholes and got a better look at the inside
of the beast. Now, normally you wouldn't be able to just see into the
frame section because there is that inner rocker beam that would be welded
up to the floor and then onto the lip of the belly pans. Lucky for me,
mine was rusted a lot and it afforded me the chance to look inside without
doing any cutting. Yet, I had to cut out the rest of rocker so I just went
ahead and did that so I could start working on the frame. There was at
least a pound or two of flaky rust crap and dirt that I dug out of it.
Once I had that all done I got a wirebrush and went to town.  I ended up
scrapping the hell out of my arm because the gap between the floor and the
pans was pretty narrow.  After that, I got some silver POR-15(read, chunky
style POR15 for frames) and did the lower section of my frames with that.
Then I ran over the whole frame with th black POR15.  On my way out I
brushed on a healthy amount of it to the bottom of the pan. After that I
tacked up Ronnie's rocker(which, as I've said) was great.  

Then, for about the past two weeks I've been working on the front nose of
the bus which
you could almost copy off Thoms sight.  Instead of using the aftermarket
innersection I used the peice off of my 64 21 window.  A ton of cutting
was needed to get it down to size and into place but it's neat to see how
detailed the front is put together.  Oddly, the front of the 64 was damn
near perfect! I could still see the grey paint(believe me, it's a
shocker).  So, as Thom made a move on his panel I did followed along at
home with mine!  Ah, the wonders of the internet.  Thanks Thom!!!  
Needless to say, I'm suprised at how good a welder I've become in only a
little while.  I would recommend the Hobart Handler 120 to anyone cause a
fool could make a perfect weld with it.  All I have to do to the nose is
tack on the finishing strip and bend it down.  For the nazi purist in me,
I was looking at my 21 windows clip and I notices that there is not only
one strip, but two! There is one that folds over the edge and there is one
that is tucked up inside the folded one(before it is folded down). I also
will take close note of how the edges of the peices are cut at an angle
before I take it on.  
  I'm still the slowest resto'er in the world.  Probably due to time,
inexpereince, and money.  I find myself kind of shying away from a project
that I think are too big(like doin' a full right rear corner replacement) 
just because I don't think I've got the experience it would take to do the
job right.  Then I see the metal wiz do it and I figure I'd go ahead with
it!  And, to let you know, that turned out amazing also.  

So, the bus is almost ready for paint!  More to come later. As they say in
Deutschland, 
bis dann,
