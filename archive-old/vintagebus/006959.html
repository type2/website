Not all W C M seals are warrantied for life, just the products they
manufacture, not the stuff they import. Their vent wing seals are OEM brazil
as are the felt channels (which are out of stock) and who knows when they
will have more, as the good manufacturer  quit making them and all everyone
has/had were right side only. Their tailight seals and some of their others
are mystery parts, who know's from where. I always inform the customer of
quality and where manufactured and stock brands from all over the world and
will sell the customer what they request and/or fit's their budget, for
instance, 62 and above tailight seals, I have them from Brazil, Germany and
India all different prices but all of good quality. The choices are yours,
know what you are buying
