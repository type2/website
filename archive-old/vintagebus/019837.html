I drove up to Dave Easterwood's nest of buses today in the newly-roadworthy
Westy.  The mission: get the accelerator pedal fixed.  Driving a bus with a
broken accelerator (pedal rusted off the floor) is interesting.  It can be 
difficult to make the pedal much more than switch between idle and full 
throttle :-)

The repair was really about as perfect as you can ask for, so I thought I'd 
share it with the list.  The remains of the bracket on the floor of the bus
were ground down to provide a flat surface.  Dave wondered if a late-bus pedal
was the same.  It was not, but the pin is the same fit at the base of the
pedal.  So the pin was driven out, and this and the hinge from the late pedal
were used in the splitty pedal.  It was necessary to cut and drive out the 
remains of the old rusty pin on the splitty pedal.  The base of the hinge was
then MIG welded to the flattened area on the floor.

Let me just say, it's really cool to have a pedal this smooth :-)

While I was there we also _properly_ bled and adjusted the brakes, which 
resulted in a great improvement in stopping ability for the bus, and less
pedal travel.  While heading out to dinner the bus' ignition conked out like 
it did a couple times on the way up...don't lay your CDI wiring across the 
preheat risers, long story short :-)  Dave's neighbor saw us on the side of
the road and helped a lot by using his vehicle to provide light in the engine
compartment.

So after today, the bus is more or less ready for the coming trip this 
Wednesday.  I've still got work to do, like putting back enough of the interior
to sleep on, and fixing the spring plate leaks.
