First things first. Not a great mechanic here but the first thing I
would do is drain the oil and take a look. Does it have metal
fragments?? If so, then it's pull and breakdown time. If not, then I
would check compression. Or, if I had a gut wrenching feeling about it,
I would just pull the engine anyways and maybe send it out to be looked
at. Maybe you have a spare motor to drop in. If not, it might be a good
idea to start lookin for one. When I got my bus, one of the first things
I did was to find a spare. Still don't know if the spare runs, but it is
on my to-do list for the next millenium.
