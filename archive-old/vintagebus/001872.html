This kind of puzzles me though..... you're right.... economy seems to be
going down the tubes and yet people are spending money left and right.......
I'm in Real Estate and so far for the past, well, more than a year we have
had great market for sellers. I'd say it's invest time..... people invest
their money...... Buying a vintage VW is an investment of sorts to some you
know.

I hope prices don't go too high though....


All the best,

&gt; It's Friday so I thought I would mention that over $100,000 in VW vehicles
&gt; changed hands this week on my site.  Several high-dollar VWs sold in mere
&gt; hours.
&gt;
&gt; Make whatever parallels you wish to the current state of our US economy.
