Here's the latest on the electrolysis rim cleaning.  This morning I went out
and checked on the rim - nice black clear metal on the areas closest to the
metal rods.  I had only used 2 rods, 180 degrees apart.  So before leaving
for work, I added a couple more rods in a helter skelter fashion so that
there are 4 rods, each covering 90 degrees of the rim.  It's been sitting
now for about 4 to 5 hours this way and when I came home, I was pleasantly
surprised to see way more rusty bubbly foam scum floating on the water than
was generated in the previous 8 to 10 hours using 2 rods.  The best part
about this is that I'm derusting parts without having to work on them!  No
more killing off evenings or taking days off from work to clean those
parts - I let electricity do the work for me while I'm at work making money
to pay to have the rims powdercoated! :-)

I'm not sure if leaving the rim in for too long will affect the metal itself
but I'm under the impression, based upon advice from my grandfather, that it
will pull just the rust and gunk off and not really affect anything else.
For example, the painted areas of the rim appear untouched but all rusted
areas are giving off bubbles and derusting themselves.

I'll continue to keep you update on how this all turns out.
