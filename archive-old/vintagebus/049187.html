A white/red kombi on the season premier of the animated series Futurama last night. Somebody was assembling a car with parts from evil vehicles, steering wheel from Hitler's car, turn signal lights from Charlie Manson's bus, windshield wipers from...  It was a split, with the (\X/) symbol, but the turn signals were being taken from below the headlights as in '68-71 bays. The stock t/s appeared above the headlights. The worse episode *ever*. Anybody know if Manson had a bus?
