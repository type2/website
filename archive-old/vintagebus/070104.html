&gt; &gt;Well, if Maxwell's demon actually worked, you could get AC for free.
&gt;
&gt; I don't want it for free...I'm just looking for an agreement that there
&gt; is a nonzero minimum theoretical cost (1 hp buys you 2500 Btu/hr of
&gt; cooling) and that in reality it costs more than that.

I will agree that, for a given working fluid, and given hot and cold
temperatures, there can be calculated a minimum work input to the
compressor for each unit of heat energy moved from the cold side to the
hot side.  Otherwise it would be a violation of the second law of
thermodynamics.

If forced, I will come up with numbers, but we're talking about
resurrecting themo knowledge over two decades old.
