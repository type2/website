Anyone have an idea as to what would work best? POR-15 is picky about 
thickness.

&lt;&lt; Not a bad idea to have some strategically placed holes so
 that corrosion prevention fluids may be introduced into the
 hidden cavities.. I believe the Ziebart folks drilled holes
 into some areas to applied their magic. Just put a plug into
 the holes when you are done.  I may do this as I work on my
 bus. &gt;&gt;
