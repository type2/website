Subject: Re: [VB] Pics of the truck online

&gt; OH NO, BUG EXHAUST ! What are we going to do with him!

Oh No is right, i hate that exaust, its all that is keeping me from puting
my rear bumper on. Actually i have a stock bus muffler but i am waiting to
put that on my mexican motor when i put that in the truck some time in the
next few weeks.
 Also when i do that i have a crank start apron, crank and crank pully nut
that i am gonna put on it so that i can have something nifty to show folks.
and the kids will love it too, actually i could have used it last week when
i had a dead battery.

later-
