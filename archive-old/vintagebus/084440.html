Subject: Re: [VB] fuel gauges...and Paint....

Gauge should work regardless of voltage. Use adjustment on back of
gauge to get it calibrated.

I like the older paint because it can be polished out. Just don't like
the concept of plastic paint.

    I was wondering if anyone knew if using an original 6volt fuel gauge on a
 12Volt system should work accurately?

 For the paint question:  Im going to be blasting and repainting.  I want to
 use Dove Blue and was wondering if using the original type of paint versus
 matching it with a more modern urethane has any advantages or disadvantages?
