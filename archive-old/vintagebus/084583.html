Subject: Re: [VB] poor milage

 I find I get worse milage in the winter, as I tend to let the bus sit and idle longer to warm up.   This is for round town driving, as I live in a small town and the round town driving is not very far.   
 

I'd also check the color of the tailpipe and plugs and think about rejetting the carb.  
I had found new main jets, but I have not found new air correction jets?  Any sources?  
 I would have tried some larger ones, but I didn't have them.
