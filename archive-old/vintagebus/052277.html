Subject: RE: [VB] What ever happened to the five hundred dollar bus?

In the last few days I have heard of a few buses waiting for restoration. A
customer just walked in and his daughter has a 65 Westy that he bought new,
that is just sitting in there yard and it's local and I have never heard of
it. I'm going to pick up a 1960 DD panel I just heard of this weekend. I
also know of a few of those I'm going to fix them buses that one day for
sure will end up for sale. Lately I have been amazed at all the buses still
left in this area, good rust free AZ buses.

ronnie       also coming soon to computer to you.  www.volksrescue_dot_com, for

I don't know if anyone is getting *wealthy* on it, but I know people
for whom this is their sole source of income.

&gt; Is anyone getting rich doing this? I can't believe this list would harbor
people with a success fetish. 
&gt; The extra money goes into tools, trinkets and NOS for the special project,
right?
