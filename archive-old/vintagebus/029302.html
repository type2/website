Subject: '63 Engine Install Problem Fixed

Well good news - I got the engine back in my '63 bus and it's running
again.  The problem that I had posted about was that the engine would
not turn after install and tightening of the four mounting bolts.  I was
able to talk the guy who did the rear main seal to come up and help me
out.  We pulled the engine back out and saw the problem.  Without a
picture it's hard for me to explain but there are some &quot;rivets&quot; on the
new clutch that were hitting the left side (as you look at it) of the
bell housing (the side opposite the starter).  There were marks on the
bell housing.  He said that we could just file that area down a little -
he said it wasn't a big deal.  So we did that and put the motor back in
and it turned no problem.  I hooked everything back up and it's now
running again. Woo hoo!

So, the flywheel is the same one that was on the engine when I took it
out.  I don't know if it's a 12volt wheel or not (the bus is 6volt).
The old clutch that I replaced was the old style with 3 &quot;arms&quot; - the new
one is the kind with the bunch of little arms I guess you'd call them.
So maybe I do have a 12v flywheel but I kind of doubt it only because
the guy who owned it previously (wife's cousin's husband since 1970!)
told me about all the little &quot;oddities&quot;.  He was very thorough (is a
scientist at Los Alamos labs).   Plus it wasn't the wheel that was
hitting the bell housing.  Anyway, it's working again and some
people had asked me to post the result so there it is.

Thanks for all the help!

Mike
