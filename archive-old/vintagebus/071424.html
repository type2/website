&gt; I hear ya! I have no kids (that I know of!) but were I to be so employed,
there would never be a TV in the car. Period.
&gt;
That's a lot easier to say when you don't have kids. :-)
I think on long drives, a TV is fine. Short drives around town, I wouldn't
dream of turning it on.

There's a whole lot of things I was never going to do when I had kids, but
now that I do, I do them.
