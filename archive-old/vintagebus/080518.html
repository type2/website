Subject: Re: [VB] 205T distributor timing, vacuum question

Hi Richard,
The would be:

Make sure you take the distributor apart after marking (centerpunch works 
well) the shaft and bottom drive gear to make sure they go back together the same 
direction!  Then clean and regrease the parts.  Our 205M distributor was so 
gunked up with old grease that the advance barely moved and only very slowly.
