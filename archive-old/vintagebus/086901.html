Subject: Still lookin' for a rider to Jerome.

I know this is sort of last minute, but is there anyone WITHOUT a ride that 
would like to make the Journey to Jerome from the L.A. area? My wife won't 
go.  I am offering front seat space in my bus, a very nice looking Double 
Door Camper. Would appreciate help with gas. You need your own basic camping 
gear. I have a medium sized ice chest, camp stove and cooking utensils as 
well as a coleman lantern.

There is also the possiblity that you could ride back in your own bus (all 
you gotta do is win the raffle).

If I go, Leaving from Torrance, CA sometime Thursday 9/13. Will pick up 
along the way or you can park it at my house for the weekend.

If you would like to go, P-Mail me soon.

Chris
