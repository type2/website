Subject: Re: [VB] The Best Electric Fuel Pump?
Date: Sat, 5 Aug 2000 13:01:19 -0700

[...]

The inexpensive electric fuel pump sold by most FLAPS [Walbro &amp; several
other names/brands - all identical], the one a bit smaller than a beer can
and sort of round on the bottom, is _very_ susceptible to heat whether that
heat is generated internally or externally.  For this reason it's operation
is erratic and unreliable when mounted in the engine compartment of an
air-cooled VW.

As long as they aren't forced to operate beyond their specified capacity,
and are mounted where they'll be unaffected by engine heat, they are
virtually bulletproof.  On a Type 2 this means they must be mounted
somewhere outside the engine compartment.

I have a couple of these pumps, and for years carried one in our '68
Campmobile as a backup along with a few lengths of fuel line and some wire
and terminals to jury-rig an installation.  I finally put it back on the
shelf because I never did have a problem with the stock mechanical fuel
pump.

&gt;&gt;  I ran an electric pump on mine for a couple of years, and I had some
trouble with it...  &lt;&lt;
