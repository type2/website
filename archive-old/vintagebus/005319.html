Whoops!  I didn't realize that Bus Boys only charges $289 for them.  I
thought for sure they were more than that last time I checked - more like
$600 or so.  Maybe that was a complete one.

I'll check out my replies and for anyone who is interested and in need, I'll
see about adjusting the price to accordingly.  Thanks for the into Jester!
