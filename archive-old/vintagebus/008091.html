I put the drum back on and tightened the axle nut.  The leak did not rear
its ugly head until I drove for about 20 minutes.  I have a couple more bits
o' info:  The leak did not appear to be on the outer side of the backing
plate.  I see weepy, occasionally drippy, oil on the inner side of the plate
when underneath the bus.  SO, I did not replace the seal, and I couln't find
a place for the little black O ring.  Not having a puller, I couldn't get
the race and bearing off without causing damage....
Did I mess up?  At least the leak doesn't appear to be any worse....as a
matter of fact, it seems to be exactly the same.

&gt; I think we need a one more bit of information to figure this out. Was
&gt; the drum on and the axle nut tightened when this leak happened, or did
&gt; you put in the seal and gaskets, fill the RGB and wait to see if it was
&gt; going to leak before you put the drum back on?
&gt;
&gt; The reason I ask is because the little o-ring on the stub axle has to be
&gt; compressed by the seal race in order to seal. If the drum isn't on and
&gt; the nut tight, then gearlube can leak past the o-ring and run out from
&gt; between the seal race and the axle. This isn't as much of a problem
&gt; after things have been together a while, so it doesn't usually show up
&gt; during a brake job. It's more of a problem with new parts.
&gt;
&gt; Hope that helps.
