&lt;&lt; Clara,
 
 Are there pictures of this feat around.   How did you suport the second bus? 
   How did you remove the second bus upon return?
 
 If this bus ontop a bus thing is true, I am really interested in 
 hearing/seeing how this was done!
 
 Heck, if it worked well....   Maybe I might try it?  :o)
  &gt;&gt;

there is a picture in an OBR (NEATO newsletter) a few years ago.  It is the 
front of a 60 bus cut at the windsheild pillars and just behind the metal 
divider behind the front seat.

it was put on there with a forklift

to get it off the bus, I deflated my 65s tires a bit, had some burly friends 
stand on the bumpers, drove into the tall part of my garage, used rope around 
the rafters and the bus, lifted it up, backed the bus out, and we let the 
piece down.  I have pictures of that that have NEVER BEEN PUBLISHED!!!!

the piece of bus is taking up room in the garage, and will be used eventually 
to fix my 61, it has perfect floor, doglegs, etc
