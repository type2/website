Subject: torquemeister on big nut tranny
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Split List, 
I was surprised to not see much on the use of the Kymco Torquemeister on 
removing big tranny nuts in the archive.  Has no one done this?  If so, how 
did it go?  

According to Ronnie at Kymco (nice guy), you have to:
1. Buy a torquemeister ($90)
2. Buy a drum plate adapter ($40)
3. Buy a 46mm socket ($15 ?)
4. Buy a 36mm axle nut ($5 new)
5. Cut the socket and weld it to the nut like this:

6. Get two extra long lug screws and thick washers/spacers
7. Bolt the drum plate on with the long screws and washers to essentially 
position the drum plate to compensate for the distance added by the 
nut/socket adapter.
8. away you go...

Total cost $150.

Each time I do a rear brake job I purchase 2 rear axle nuts for something 
like $10?  (It's been a while).  After acetylene and wax has failed, I use a 
cut off tool to make a tangental cut about 1/8&quot; away from the threads and to 
a depth of about 1/8&quot; away from the drum.  Nut then comes off pretty easy 
when there is such little steel left.  At $10 for 2 nuts, that is 15 changes 
before the torque meister pays for itself.  However, I would like to have a 
tool to use on the road away from the shop.  Also, the new nuts are pretty 
whimpy compared to the beefy old style ones.  

So has anyone ever done this?  Stephen White explains this in the archive, 
but I can't actually find if anyone has done it.  Would like to know before I 
leep.....
