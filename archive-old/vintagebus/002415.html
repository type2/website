are you using a &quot;self supporting&quot; starter? or does it have a shaft that
sticks out actually into the tranny. I know I went through mass headaches
with this same problem. First I was told that the starter was binding and
needed to be shimmed cause the shaft was not engaging properly....Never
heard of that but I went out and bought a late model  starter without the
shaft and it got rid of my probs.

&gt;Thanks to Dave, Pete and John for your quick response, you all ask
&gt;basically the same question; &quot;does it turn over easily by hand, when
&gt;it's hot&quot; I don't know, I'll try that when I get home this evening. What
&gt;are you guys thinking if it doesn't? What if it does?
&gt;John asked about the starter; I double-checked this by reinstalling the
&gt;original starter, and neither starter had any different result. I just
&gt;rebuilt the engine over the winter, if you are thinking this is a
&gt;mechanical problem, I'd like some tips on where to look next.
&gt;thanks
&gt;John
