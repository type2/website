&gt; hey all,
&gt; just got to work... i'm posting this so hopefully i can get an answer
&gt; before i get home tonite and do some brake work. the question i have
&gt; is what size is that castle nut on the rear axle? i am borrowing an
&gt; impact wrench and need to get a socket. i was thinking 40mm. is that
&gt; close? thanks in advance!!

Debate on the list says that it is 41mm or 42mm.  It's been stated
that a 1-5/8 socket will work.
