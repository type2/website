Hello again...

I am trying to visualize my '67 when it's all done and happening....and one
of the details is the fact that I consider oil temp. and pressure gauges,
and a head temp. gauge to be important when driving air-cooled vehicles on
long trips.  (I've learned a lot about things from the oil and head temp.
gauges on my air-cooled Vanagon).

I think I can fit all three gauges in the hole where the radio would
go...yes, I would construct a tasteful, and removable panel for them, and
maybe some kind of hood that matches the rest of the dash.  The stereo
components would be underneath the dash or behind/under the seat.
BTW.._dot_can you tell me what that hole under the front seat is intended for
(if not for the jack, handle, and wrench), and whether it is supposed to
have a cover?

Any thoughts or suggestions re: gauge placement?

Thanks, Gene
