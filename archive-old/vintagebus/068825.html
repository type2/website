Subject: Re: Anyone with a side step for sale?

We do.

As seen on our web site:

Probably the most popular accessory we've ever done! This beautiful
accessory will last as long as your Bus or Vanagon because the wide-ribbed
anodized aluminum extrusion allows for a lightweight, yet very strong unit
that's corrosion-resistant and easy to keep clean. Simple to install, the
Side Step mounts in the existing Jack-Holes (drilling is required for
locking allen bolts, allen wrench is included) and includes stainless steel
hardware for long life, rust resistance and quick removal. A must for anyone
using their side door for loading passengers, groceries, camping gear or
just about anything! Mounts on both sides to allow safe and easy access to
the roof rack.

210-08001  Side Step, Bus 50-79  $152.90

250-08001  Side Step, Vanagon 80-91  $152.90

&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance,
