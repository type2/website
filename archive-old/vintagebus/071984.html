Subject: ohio auction goes to high bidders

Hey listees,

       I went to the auction in Mechanicsburg Ohio yesterday. There where 
three things
a handful of sedans,a 59 euro panel with working semiphores, a bay window a 
couple rabbit trucks, a 60 crew cab pretty rust free but had been wrecked on 
the drivers side.
and a 61 single cab with rabbit seats ply wood bed bottom cut wheel wells, 
and home made bumpers.  This auction was full of nice cars but, they all went 
for top dollar.
I should have written down the prices for the exact numbers, but these are 
the ones that i remember       
                                59 panel 12,198 kilometers    7,200 dollars

dollars
                                61 single cab  cut up and rusty 1000 dollars
                                67 euro sedan 10,042 kilometers 3400 dollars

                                74 thing 10,870  no title present at auction 
7600 dollars 
    
       All vehicles with exception of the two pick ups and one sedan started 
up before they where sold. All vehicles sounded and looked great. all had 
been repainted had new or original interior,and where all from florida. 
approx. attendance was about 500 
people.  Lots of rare oem parts and accesories stacks of tires and wheels 
also tools and shop supplies where for sale too.  almost everything went for 
top dollar. 
no sleepers to be had at this auction.
