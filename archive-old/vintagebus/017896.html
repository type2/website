Eric and Barb-
Well, I finally got around to removing, disassembling,
and soldering the connections in my headlight switch
in the 65 double cab, and boy does it make a
difference.
The switch doesn't get hot when the lights are on, and
the headlights are noticeably brighter.
Wish I would have know to do this 10 years ago.
Thanks much for the info.
