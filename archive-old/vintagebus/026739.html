I rebuilt the carb a few months ago just to learn about it.  I had no problems
after i rebuilt the carb.  All was fine..
does this sound like a faulty idle cut off jet?  What would happen if I took the
wire off while the motor was running? what changes would or should I notice?

&gt; How did it run before the carb rebuild? Did you rebuild the carb to fix this

&gt; &gt; the motor runs really choppy and will quit under its own power...or lack
&gt; &gt; thereof.  it idles super low and its just no fun.

&gt; &gt; my list of things I've done.
