Since I've been rather silent lately, I thought I would post about my first
week of driving the bus.  In short, it's been absolutely wonderful.  I'm on
this big VW high while cruising around.  I've got the window wings open, the
sliding windows open, and the air vent on full &quot;On.&quot;  I've taken about 10
people for rides and they are all are impressed so some degree or another.
So far 8 of my riders were male and they all remarked on how you sit so &quot;up
front.&quot;  A couple of my riders thought that the air box was a really neat
idea and couldn't figure out why manufacturers today don't use this concept
for an air vent.  The female passengers were my mom and sister (the cute
blonde moved to Texas before I could give her a ride) and they both like the
old bus.  Even good old mom said that she would consider getting rid of some
of her Chevies and replacing them with with a bus!

I think I've driven every road in Beatrice at least 3 times.  I've put on
over 140 miles and driven the bus to work for the past 3 days.  I still have
all my tools and stuff inside and have plenty more work to do but the sheer
joy and thrill of driving this old 67 deluxe around is absolutely wonderful.
Reminds me of my first trips around town in Li'l Red 3 years ago.  The bus
seems to elicit more attention as there are quite a few more bugs on the
road now than there were before.  I've had people honk, wave (including a
prominent doctor) and a good looking gal mouth to me, &quot;Cool Van.&quot;  Of course
I get a lot of disgusted looks from the elderly stuff shirts around here but
screw 'em anyway.  So far the BEST reaction was when I drove by the high
school just as it was letting out.  Wow!  The kids a hollering and pointing
was just phenomenal.  The funny part was that one road by the school is
blocked off 3 times a day for the bus kids.  There is a big sign that says,
&quot;Road Closed Bus Only.&quot;  I wonder what kind of legal loopholes I could pull
off by driving through there.  The sign DOES NOT say school buses - just
'Bus Only.&quot;  I think that includes me. :-)

I still have a lot of cleaning to do and I've just got to unload my tools
and get the bench seat installed but it's hard now to do those things when
you know just how much more fun it is driving around.  I'm sure in time
it'll become old hat but for now, it's absolutely a blast.  My only gripe
right now is that my steering box, despite being adjusted as tight as
possible, is still loose. I think it's worn out so I might have to pull the
box out of my 66 and use it and if I do, then I'm pretty sure I'm gonna part
her out.  Once you yank the steering box, that pretty much is the end of
it - especially when it's borderline shell already.  I'll notify all of you
when that times comes.  Despite the rust on the 66, it's got a PERFECT
nose - no dents, a perfect solid roof, an excellent shape chrome VW logo,
all the glass, front end, good ebrake cables, etc.  Please don't email me
with requests just yet.  I'll notify the list when the time comes.

Bus ownership is great and I'm really looking forward to traveling around to
the shows this summer in it.  I'll see you around...
