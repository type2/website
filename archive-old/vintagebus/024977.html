Hey Vintage Volks-

I just signed up to the list this week.  I have been on the Type2 list
in the past to help me out with my '70 Campmobile.

Just this week, a very tempting and interesting situation has come up.
I have the opportunity to pick up a 1962 Bus from an &quot;in-law&quot; for a very
cheap price.  I live in Truckee, CA and the bus is sitting in his back
yard in Espanola, NM.  It hasn't been driven since about 1990 but he
says he has started it &quot;a few times.&quot;  He says is definitely needs new
brakes (drums) all the way around.  Thre are 40,000 miles on the engine
since the last rebuild.  He says the body is in &quot;good&quot; shape.  I know
that when he was actively using the bus, he kept it in great mechanical
shape.   He also had added some sort of gas heater too.

I've owned my '70 for about 3 years and have done most of the work on it
myself including a few engine pulls but I would still rank my bus
mechanical skills as average at best.  So, my questions:

1.  Is is worth it? (I know it is) I'd obviously have to tow it back
here to CA since I can't afford the time to go and out there and spend a
couple weeks fixing it up so it could make the long trek back.
2.  What is the time/effort/money involved in converting to 12-volt?
If I leave it 6 volt, what sort of things might come back to haunt me?
3.  What is the time/effort/money involved in doing the brakes?  I've
never done brakes on any car I've ever owned.
4.  I'm thinking of flying out there for a quick weekend to take a look
at the bus.  Would anyone in the area be interested in doing a little
research with me?

Thanks for any advice and/or help!!

Mike
