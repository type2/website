Subject: heater question

I have a 65 bus with a SO 42 Z bed, that me and my family go camping in.
As we are coming up on our first winter in the bus, we have been trying
to figure out what we are going to do for a heater. I have found a gas
heater from a thing for $50 with no control knob or ductwork. I suppose
that I could fabricate those. I wanted advice if this was worth it or if
a portable propane heater would be more cost effective and safer in the
long run. I would have to repace my heater boxes if I was going to go
that rout ( i replaced the worn out boxes with $5 j tubes from a swap
meet). Also , now that I am on this , I wanted to thank Jeff Kidwiller.
Last summer ,when me and my family drove the bus from Dallas, Texas to
Parkersburg, West Virginia, we had a overheating problem due to a lean
air correction jet and Jeff was a big help ( even if we couldn't find
the jet ) , It is great that something like the Interstate Rescue is on
the net.
