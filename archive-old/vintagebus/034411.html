Hey kevin

Generally, I'd say its better to gain
access to the space between the floor
and the belly pans by pulling the floor.

Its not any easier to get out but its MUCH easier
to get back in (welding down instead of overhead
and all over yerself to boot).  Cargo floor
repro pieces and repair sections are also much more like
original than current belly pan repros....

So, open from the top if everything looks and feels OK
(outriggers, inner rockers etc) treat surface rust and paint 
and put floor back in.  Any real disease in there and you'll
end up having to pull both floor and pans to fix it (properly)
anyway...

good luck

		I am planning on taking apart my 23 window to start the body
and 
	paint work and I just have a couple of questions. I have a couple of
holes 
	cut in the floor about 4 inches from the cargo doors that I was
looking into 
	with a flash light to see what the frame looked like......surface
rust......I 
	want to get it out and was wondering if it would be easier to take
the cargo 
	floors out and clean and treat or visa versa with the belly
pans......I have
