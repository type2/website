Subject: Re: [VB] Only you can prevent engine fires

Thanks for the advice Matt.  People usually don't buy a fire extinguisher
for their car until they have already had a fire.

While we're on the subject, does anyone know if a fire extinguisher needs to
be recharged or whatever they do to them?  Does the stuff in them go bad?

Thanks again,
Ed

&gt; All,
&gt;
&gt; Just another Public Service Announcement to keep a fire extinguisher
&gt; in _all_ your vehicles.  This evening I was working on the lawn mower
&gt; in the driveway, adjusting the carb after a successful tune-up.  I
&gt; smelled something burning and I figured it was maybe some of the
&gt; solvent burning out or one of the new gaskets getting a little warm.
&gt; Nope - I looked down the street to the stop sign and an S-10 was
&gt; stopped with smoke pouring out of the front.
&gt;
&gt; I grabbed the extinguisher out of my Toyota and ran down there.
&gt; There were a few people from the neighborhood there but nobody had
&gt; an extinguisher.  There were flames under the left wheel well that
&gt; I knocked down with the extinguisher, and when the kid got the hood
&gt; open I hit a couple more hot spots.  The fire department came by
&gt; and hosed it down a little to finish cooling it off and that was
&gt; that.
&gt;
&gt; I know he lost part of a wiring harness, an ATF line (I could see
&gt; the fluid leaking out under the truck), and some assorted small
&gt; rubber hoses.  But that sure beats losing a whole truck.
&gt;
&gt; I keep a fairly big extinguisher just to the left of the driver's
&gt; seat in my Bus, and smaller ones under the front seats of my other
&gt; cars.  Hopefully I won't ever have to _use_ one on one of my own
&gt; cars, but it's a lot better to have one and not need it than it is
&gt; to need one and not have it.  This has been a public service
&gt; announcement.
