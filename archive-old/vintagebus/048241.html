&lt;&lt; I would think along the same lines as the purchaser of the engine. Turn key
 is turn key!! A vendor selling a 1600 &quot;should&quot; have the carb jetted for the
 1600 irregardless of the vehicle the purchaser is putting it into, duh!  &gt;&gt;
Hi,
We think that Gary is stating this in tongue and cheek style.  
   If you look at the jetting for the pre-1968 bug, bus, and K ghia, of the
years when they had the same sized engine.  You will find different sized jets
for each.  This could be due to how the different engine compartments breath
and the different air cleaners and mufflers.  Even when if you changed from a
stock air cleaner to a VW heavy duty air cleaner the jets in any of the VWs
had to be changed.  That not only means a change in the main jet, but in the
pilot, and air correction jet.   Eric &amp; Barb
