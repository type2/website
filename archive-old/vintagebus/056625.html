Hi Joel,
It will if the spring will not allow the relief valve down enough to pour oil 
directly back into the sump.  Though if you are having low oil pressure idiot 
light showing when the guage shows either your idiot light sender and/or oil 
pressure gauge are incorrect.  With high oil pressure it could be the spring 
in the oil pressure idiot light sender has been crushed down a bit.  Better 
get a mechanical gauge and calibrate with that.
