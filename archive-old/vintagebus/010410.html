&gt; What is this list coming to when the list admin. can make remarks like
that
&gt; about people who do so much for not just the VW community, but for very
&gt; worthwhile charitable organizations as well.  Ronnie and John are just
about
&gt; the best kind of fold anyone, VW nut or otherwise, could hope to meet.
&gt; Perhaps if you would attend a REAL bus event, you might just realize what
&gt; it's all about.  Until then, you might want to consider keeping your snide
&gt; remarks to yourself, thank you very much.

Uh-oh. Somebody's getting poopie again. I've been off this list a long time,
when did all the up-tight people start subbing?
