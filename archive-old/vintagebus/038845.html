WAU.

I mean of course with a converter from 12 v to 6 v between. 
I think (had heard) that it could be a problem to get power enough to feed
the 12 v batteri (and again the heater) so it could heat for many hour's,
day by day, if I convert from 6v to 12 v ?
Would it not be easier to convert the 12 v to 6 v (starter, light, radio) ?
Could the light with more get enough power to work through the batteri, I
mean that the most power is going directly from the generator to the light,
batteri and so on ?

VWenligt Ciao
