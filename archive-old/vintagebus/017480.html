It's a very rare case that a popping out of gear problem is linkage-related.
It's time to start saving your pennies for a new tranny.  Actually, that
time has come and gone..

&gt; I've seen a lot of responses (but didn't save any) regarding adjustment of
&gt; the shift rods to stop this problem. Could someone please post the
&gt; troubleshooting procedure for this or point me to where it's already posted?
&gt; I know the problem may be in the transmission itself, but I thought I'd try
&gt; adjusting the shift rods first.
&gt; thanks in advance.
