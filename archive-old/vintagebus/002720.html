renoir here,

Regarding front disk brakes for a 71.
Bentley on page 18 of Brakes and Wheels  on blowout of Disk brake assembly
that
item #5 is a
Piston retaining plate.
What does it do?

I do not see that part listed with any suppliers.

My right outside pad only sticks and wears and pulls the vehicle.
My disk wobbles a bit, could this be do to bad inner bearings?

thanks all

'71 West
icq 750800
I have changed hoses.
