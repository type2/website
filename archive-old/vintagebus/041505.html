Keep in mind that moth balls with paradichlorobenzine (PDB) are considered
to be carcinogens.  The state of California will no longer allow me to use
PDB in my science labs.  Too bad, too, since it has interesting melting
properties.

It shouldn't be a problem for an occasional treatment, but I wouldn't
leave PDB in your bus all the time.

&gt; &gt;I use moth balls! The smell keeps them out rather than killing them and

&gt; Funny you should mention this Richard.  I did exactly that - using moth
&gt; balls, flakes, and whatever form it comes in.  I would return 2 days later
&gt; to find the bus smelling fairly strongly of moth repellant but ALL the
&gt; mothballs/flakes were gone.  A week later, you couldn't even tell I
&gt; mothballed it at all.  Come to find out, where the bus was sitting was in
&gt; direct sunlight.  As it would heat up inside, I guess it accelerated the
&gt; evaporation rate.  This happened on at least 2 occasions that I know of.
&gt; That's why I suggested poison or some kind of permanent repellant because
&gt; the mothballs just didn't seem to last nor be worth the money spent.  Just
&gt; my 2 cents...
