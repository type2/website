&gt; so did you do the measuremnet of the ps/cs like it says in Muir's book?
&gt; put the ring in the cylinder and measure the gap.?
&gt; 
&gt; did you CLEAN OUT THE RING GROOVES?  if they have lots of crud in there, it
&gt; may make it hard to the rings to move freely.
&gt; 
&gt; how many miles/hours on this motor? 

Thank you for your reply Clara :)

This is not a short block that was in need of a rebuild. 
It ran fine for many miles around the island for a period of several
months with no sign of degrading performance. When I pulled the 
motor it was because I had one that I rebuilt ready to install.
If at all possible I want to get the rings unstuck without 
disturbing the case to cylinder seal push rod tube seal etc. 
Therefor, I want to do everything possible in with out exposing the
internals of the engine. I am working on this thing under a mango
tree...
