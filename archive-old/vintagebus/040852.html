Very, very cool.  I'm way behind on digests.
I only have 85 digests to catch up with.
Fortunately I'm reading the most recent first.

Let me say how cool it is to know such an old crew
exists.  I am a fan of crewcabs, whatever the make.
So far I know of, or have seen, or read about or own 
the following 'oldest' crewcabs of the various makes/models.

'65 Chevy &quot;restored&quot;, they lengthened the frame to 
allow use of a standard bed, can you say UGLY, saw it in
a truck magazine.

'64 F100 Ford CrewCab oldest and maybe only F100 half ton 
crewcab ever.  I mean who was dumb enough to build a truck 
with a 500 lb payload?! (after adding the weight of another cab)  
Don't know, but it's my truck, and in family since '65.

'58 Ford F250 CrewCab, gorgeous truck, Ford-trucks_dot_com website

'56 GMC Firetruck special coach built crewcab body put onto a 
regular frame, custom built recently, saw in truck magazine.

I was afraid that someone other than VW was gonna have the
'oldest' crewcab.  That brochure for a '53 Binz was cool,
but to find a '54 is even mo' betta.

Website devoted to CrewCabs, one of these days . . . . .
Obviously pictures highly desired.

Jeff  '64 F100 CrewCab and a wannabusser, and wanna Binz
