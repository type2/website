 mister no quarter, what you are looking for are vw part#  111 198 053 OS
these are 10 under crank,  80 over case and 2 over on thrust, what you want
to make sure
is that the thrust fits correctly, if not you will have to machine the
bearings inner thrust ring
to fit, no problem any  machine shop  should be able to fit the bearing for
you

and again, my offer stands , i will send you the bearings and you can pay me
(o forget it)
i'll just give them to you for your loyality to your bus. MERRY CHRISTMAS.

ps. these may be a difficult bearing to locate, as i generally don't stock
any 80 over case
bearings, but will locate on MONDAY and ship to you by the end of next week,
if any
problems arise i will inform you.

have a great holiday

PSS. i have been getting a few complaints about my email responses.
