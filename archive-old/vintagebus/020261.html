Subject: Strange request for local VW bus/van owners

Hey....I'm a big VW fan, I drive one of the new ones, and have always 
been infatuated with the old ones, especially the vans/buses.  My 
senior prom is in two weeks, and my friends and I thought it would be 
really fun to rent a VW van or bus instead of a limo...one of our 
parents could drive us, and it would be so much more distinctive than 
a limo, not to mention more appropriate to our personalities.  My 
only problem is that I can't find a VW van or bus to rent.  I was 
wondering if anyone had any suggestions about ways I could go about 
finding a VW bus or van to rent in the NY/Southern CT area.  My prom 
is in two weeks.  The only suggestion I've had so far is that there's 
a VW convention in Norwalk this weekend.

If anyone knows of some way I could find a VW bus/van, or has one 
that they'd be willing to rent (to be driven by a responsible adult 
with insurance), please contact me at sorrowofceres_at_yahoo_dot_com, or 
gnome777_at_aol_dot_com

Thank you
Margot
