Hi AL,
You do need both the spring on the clutch pedal up front and on the clutch 
cable arm on the tranny!

&lt;&lt;Also, the lever on the trans is curved inward toward the trans, and the 
other lever I have is straight, which one is correct for a 66 bus?  &gt;&gt;

That would be a curved arm for your year, BUT you need the proper arm to 
match the left side plate on your tranny that the rear of the boden tube goes 
throgh!  If the rear end of the boden tube does not aim directly through the 
clutch cable arm on the tranny your clutch cable will rub against one side of 
the inside of the tip of the boden tube and you will need to replace the 
worn/broken cable due to this about every 6-10,000 miles!  There were two 
styles of curved armed clutch cable arms with the same length and curve which 
can be used with thier pre-1968 style side plate..  The post-1967 arms came 
in an early short arm and later longer/taller arm and both of these requred 
two differant post-1967 side plates to achieve proper boden tube/clutch cable 
to arm alignment for each.
