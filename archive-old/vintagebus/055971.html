Subject: Re: [VB] Spark prug blew out!

It happened to me too, go to NAPA or any FLAP and tell them what happened,
they have a kit for recutting the threads on the cylinder head as well as
inserts that you can screw into the head and then screw the spark plug back
in. Mine has held for several thousand miles, the kit cost about $40.00.
Make sure when you re-thread the head that you use grease on the tool, this
will minimize the aluminum scrap that gets into the cylinder. I turned over
the engine a couple of times by hand to blow the crap out before I stuck the
plug back in.
