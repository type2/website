Subject: RE:  Rabbit oil temp. gauge into a bus
Date: Wed, 19 Aug 1998 09:22:24 -0500

&gt;Has anyone ever tried to install a Rabbit VDO oil temperature gauge 
&gt;and sender into an upright VW engine?  I plan on doing that to my `63 
&gt;Camper with a SP 1600.  I have a good working gauge and sender out 
&gt;of a `79 rabbit...I am told with a T-fitting I can install the Rabbit
sender 
&gt;at the stock idiot oil light....

No problem using the gauge/sender.  They're calibrated to work together
and oil temp is oil temp.  Installing the sender at the top of the
engine on a T with the pressure sensor is not such a good idea though.
Since there's no real oil flow past a sender mounted there, you're not
really getting a good reading.  Maybe you can find or fabircate an
adapter that would allow you to mount the sender in the oil drain plug
location?  That's what I'm thinking about doing with a gauge/sender I
got from an Audi.
