Subject: [VB] Hula Girl/BobbinHead website.


Does anyone know what happened to the company that was at 
www.bobbinhead_dot_net?  There was a discussion on the list a while back about 
some great quality Hula girls that they were selling.   At the time I 
bookmarked the sight.  Last night I bought a 59 Singlecab that is screaming 
to have a hula girl in it, but I go to the sight and it is no longer there.

:(

Any help on finding this sight would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Mike Lynch (duneitrite_at_hotmail_dot_com)
