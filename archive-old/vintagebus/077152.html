Please move to France, or better yet Gernany

Well might be a good idea, seeing as I have never been to GerNany. I hear that
it's pretty there at this time of year. Paris is better in the spring.

Like politics, Christmas needs to be contemplated beyond what is seen on the
surface and presented by the media. My opinion is that Christmas is a birthday
party, not the perception of some overly hyped, commercially controled,
propaganda fronted, tax payer supported endeavor that is represented by a
seemingly jolly under qualified smirking guy, claiming to take care of the
world in short order based on myths,lies and lots of behind the
scenes-undocumented support. Oh wait, nevermind that is the GOP. ;-p

Basically dude, thanks for the knee-JERK reaction that I was looking for. I
hope that &quot;y'all&quot; have had a great day. Enjoy that new CD [Hayseed Dixie &quot;A
Hillbilly Tribute to AC/DC]. By the way just because it sounds lake cuntree
musick dont make it new tunes. (It is really rock and roll covered over to
sound like something else...] kinda lake that there feller from Crawford. It's
still the same ol' tune no matter how you slice it.
God bless and buy 'merican... where ever it's manufactured now-a-days.
