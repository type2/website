Subject: Drivin' my bus.


&gt; With a shot front end and all kinds of crap laying all over inside of the
&gt; bus (tools, interior panels, parcel tray, etc. - I managed to fire up the
&gt; bus (with its new plates and tags) and drove myself to the barber shop.
&gt; That first real trip in my splittie was awesome!  The wind blowing in the
&gt; window wings and the sound of the engine was all so surreal.  No wonder
you
&gt; guys and gals love your old buses - I can see myself driving one of these
&gt; things until the day I die.  Anyway, once that was done, I filled the tank
&gt; and the gas guage only reads a hair above empty.  Wonderful - one more
thing
&gt; to fix when I yank out the 1600 and put the 1776 in.  I think I just need
to
&gt; get a new sending unit because the guage is brand spankin' new.  You
should
&gt; have seen the people turning and staring as I drove around - it was like I
&gt; was in a parade. Moving right along, I drove to the lumber yard, loaded up
4
&gt; of my workmates and we cruised the lumber yard.  They all thought it was
&gt; awesome as well.  Even the gal that dumped me without ever telling me was
&gt; invited in for a quick ride around the yard and she accepted and rode and
&gt; enjoyed.
&gt;
&gt; So this is what a VW high is like.
&gt;
&gt; I like it.
