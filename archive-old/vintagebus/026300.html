Okay fellow V-Dubers, I have another one for ya, concerning bodywork.
Here is the situation: My 67 Camper has a bunch of creases in the front
accompanied by holes from a PO who tried to pull them out. The front end
is, I am sure, horribly weakened by these numerous holes (a PO also set
the bus up for a front end tire, the extra stress cracked the plastic
body filler he/she lathered on there). How should I go about fixing
them? I know I should weld them up, but I don't have a welder, and how
would I go about pulling the dents out, drill more holes? What about
body solder? How thick are the sheet metal panels on VW's? What type
welder should I get (100-200 price range, less would be better) if I
were to get one and from where? Thanks for your help.

Chris
