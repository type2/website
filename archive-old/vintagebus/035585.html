The taillight gremlins in my 59 SC are still as yet un diagnosed.   Though I
found 6V dual filament taillight bulbs at Shuck's, that doesn't seem to be the
problems (I wanted spares anyway, so I don't mind spending the 2 bucks)

Have correct 40hp oil bath aircleaner in Truck now, with breather tube
attached and *pre-heat tube* hooked up.   Tis the season for carb icing, at
least in the PNW, and to  those w/o them I recommend getting it- the VW will
run better in damp chilly weather.   I previously had the 36hp style air
cleaner, which did not have attachments for the breather tube (which spit oil
in the engine compartment) or for the preheat tube.   An early (53?  59?)
edition of the bus workshop manual mentioned carb icing problems under certain
weather conditions, and said you basically have to lump it, although VW later
switched their 'tude and made some thing to address it  :).  The engine did
have the rear tin with small preheat hole and the small tin under the rear tin
with the hole for the pre heat tube, but not the extra metal tube under there,
but it'll work without, just not as groovy as having all the little parts.
