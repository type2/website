&gt; I was at the local junkyard recently and got a pair of mid 70's Bug heat
&gt; exchanger tubes.
&gt; They are 17&quot; long, convoluted plastic with a wire mesh liner that has
&gt; some sort of insulation in the mesh (hopefully not asbestos).  The ends
&gt; are 2 3/4&quot; dia and one end has a rubber reducing ring to make it 2 1/2&quot;
&gt; dia. Don't know if they will fit my '67 Kombi, but they looked

Yup, they fit just fine on _my_ '67 Kombi!  The lining is some kind of
fabric or organic fiber behind the mesh.  They were good at quieting the
air stream on bug, which follows a very short path to the rear heat
outlets.  I think the muffling is mainly to cancel exhaust noise coupled
through the heat exchangers.

The original pods and metal hoses on my '67 had the worst of both coasts;
loaded up with California dust and partly eaten by Massachusetts rust,
so it was good to subsitute a plastic tube for the worst one.  Now
if I can only find the other tube parted out from that '73 bug..
