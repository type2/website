 RE&gt;36hp  :-(
 6/27/99            5:05 PM

After 5 years of dedicated, everyday service, the 36hp in my 59 Single Cab left me stranded.   I was driving along and all of sudden felt a strange shake towards the rear.(it was enough to make the doors rattle)  At first I thought a flat tire but soon put acceleration and vibration in the same thought and quickly turned off the motor hoping to save myself from some really bad damage.  Luckily I was near a friends house and I was able  coast into his yard.  Still the fact is that I am a few miles from home, in the rain, and I am late for an important appointment.  Do I run the motor with the shakes or thumb it back into town?  I decided to leave the truck there, and found alternative transportation.  After the rained stopped I went back for future inspection.  
These are my findings:
Motor starts and runs   BUT  If you accelerate the motor shakes more then I think it should,  and lots more than it ever has.
No oil being thrown, or smoke from the exhaust.  ( I hope that is a plus in my favor)
Plugs are all oil free, and performance did not improve after cleaning
Retarded and advanced timing and no improvement.
The shake isn't a misfire kinda thing but almost seems to be in a horizontal direction.

I was planning to take the motor out this summer to detail it and replace the intake but after this I am not for sure what to do first.  My first thought is to take it out, strip it down, and take it to a VW guy to look at.  But can he tell anything without tearing it down to see if anything is broken inside?  Should I pull it to him so he can hear it running before I pull the motor?  Do I pull it and take it to him still together so he can run it on his test stand?
Is there anythgin else I can do to diagnose the problem?
