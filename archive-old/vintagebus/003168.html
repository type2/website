&gt;You may notice that the panel has
&gt;a metal frame around it, that looks a bit more than custom. the window on
the
&gt;door is a crank out type.
&gt;Anyway, does this interior look familiar to anyone?

My old 63 camper had that style of interior. Same blonde paneling. Same
single-pane crank out windows. The metal trim goes with the window. On mine
the windows were mounted in holes sawn in the body, not stock window
openings. I don't know who made it, I used to think it was Sundial, but I
kind of doubt that now. It's one of the American camper conversions, though.
