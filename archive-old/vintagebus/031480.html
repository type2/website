Amen to that!  Earlier this year I met a very nice fellow in Maryland, and an
old VW hand to boot, that picked up a wreck of a '67 DC and said he was putting
$20K into a complete resto.  Then I told him I bought my show-quality DC on the
Left Coast and shipped it to Virginia for half of that.  Hope I didn't get him
in dutch with his wife!
