Subject: Re: [VB] Introduction and Security Device

All of the alarms and gadgets just slow down the joyriders.  The people
who are stealing VW's *really* want them, and nothing is going to
stop them short of welding it to an I-beam embedded in your garage floor.

Your only real protection is adequate insurance.

&gt; My question is also on security devices. ( I apologize to the group if you
&gt; already covered this, but I just signed on.)I understand there is a problem
&gt; with nice old VW's being a target.  What do you folks recommend?  I have an
&gt; UNGO system on my 83 911SC, but as people are mentioning, no one pays
&gt; attention to alarms anymore.  I have seen the shift lock systems for bugs,
&gt; do they work for a 67 bus?   Any recommendations as to a good brand?
