Subject: Re: Headlight Eye Brows

Most likely because for some odd reason their opinion may differ from your 
own



&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;
&gt;Since it's friday thought I'd ask:  Anyone know where to get headlight
&gt;eye
&gt;brows/lids? &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;The real question should be. . . &quot;just why would anyone want headlight
&gt;eyebrows??!!&quot;
&gt;
