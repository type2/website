Subject: Re: [VB] Dying at stop lights -me too.

Ive been having this same problem, and i dont have vaccuum advance, nor do i
have a fuel cutoff solenoid. Just started dying at stoplights one day and
never got better. have installed new points, set timing/dwell, checked all
electrical wires, checked plug wires for shorts, changed rotors/caps,
removed carb and cleaned out multiple times. checked intake manifold (its a
16 single port)....yet it still does it. This is my only daily driver _at_60
miles a day so i cant keep it off the road for too long. I just bumped up
and disconnected the auto choke to keep it from dying until I could figure
it out (of course idles high now). I actually lost 10mpg by that slight
adjustment. Engine has 10k miles on it now with every single bolt on part
new 10k miles ago.. Only thing I haven't had a chance to check yet is to
re-adjust the valves .... is it possible that your valves can go that far
out of wack from normal use/normal circumstances that the engine would want
to die?

&gt;Are you sure about the wire to the fuel cutoff solenoid on your carb?
&gt;If the voltage falls below the cutoff threshold, it's stallsville.
