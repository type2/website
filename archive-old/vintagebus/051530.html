Subject: Oh the Power of Duct Tape!!

I was helping my daughter move today.  When I had the bus loaded I started
it up.  I heard a backfire and all of a sudden the bus started acting like
it had a major vaccum leak.  When I opened the hood I discovered that the
metal pug near the bottom of the carborator was gone (nowhere to be seen).
Evidently the back pressure from the backfire pushed it out.  By the time I
figured out what happened was by myself with load of stuff.  Because it was
acting like a vaccum leak (actually when I accelerated it would feed a bunch
of air from the hole into the mix going to the cylinders), I thought if I
could somehow plug the hole I would be ale to at least get home.

I started to root thru my daughters stuff to see if I could 'McGuiver' a
solution.  I came across a roll of duct tape in one of the boxes.  I used 2
3 inch pieces of tape and covered the hole.  I drove it 15 miles to her new
house and back home; it drove as if there never was a problem.

Try doing something like that on a F*rd !!
