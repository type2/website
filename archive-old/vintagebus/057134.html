&gt; &gt; guaranteed a swap spot buy a new vendor spot (I
&gt; also heard they were sold
&gt; &gt; out). I was also informed that the San Jose police
&gt; will be making any body
&gt; &gt; camped out in the street to move. So good luck to
&gt; any or all that are going
&gt; &gt; to try and get it to show and/or swap.
