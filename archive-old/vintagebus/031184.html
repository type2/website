My '67 DC has a rubber line connecting to the tank, changing to metal
where it runs above the tranny area, then rubber to go through the
bulkhead to the engine compartment, then metal up to the fuel pump.  I
made sure I used mini-clamps on all the rubber bits.

&gt; My fuel line ruptured just above the nosecone on my DC, and with the price
&gt; of gas these days, I can't really afford that to happen again.  So after
&gt; crawling around under there, my fuel line from the tank to the pump
&gt; alternates from rubber to metal like six times.  That can't by right.  I was
&gt; looking through the online parts manual and didn't see any mention of the
&gt; line.  Should it be metal all the way except a small rubber piece at the
&gt; tank and at the pump?
