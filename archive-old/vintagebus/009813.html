Subject: Re: [VB] RE: Jerome/Bunch of Stories

I've noticed this too about John Howard that he seems to win a lot of stuff
however, he always buys a lot of raffle tickets because he fully supports
the charities that the money goes to.  He also gives away stuff that he
can't use or gives it back to the raffle to be raffled again.  Yes, he wins
a lot but he's got a big heart standing by that thick wallet of his. :-)
