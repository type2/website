If the nuts keep loosening you may just have a set of studs that have been
tweaked. The threads may be pulled, etc. 10mm aren't the most desireable
studs, but have you tried replacing them? Or installing a second nut as a
jam nut on each stud? OTOH there are tapered studs available. 10mm at the
case end and 8mm at the head end. And no, I don't know where to get them,
probably some race suppliers, but I have actually seen them and they do
exist. I think they keep them with the pickup bumpers.
