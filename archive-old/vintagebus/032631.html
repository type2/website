maybe you should try this new-fangled thing called the freeway ( at least
that's what i think it's called).  screw caravanning, i learned the hard
way on that.  i don't mind going with one or two other busses, but any more
than that is a major PITA. by the time everyone decides they need to pee at
every stop, and needs gas one stop after you just filled up, or wants to
eat at all the kentuckey-fried-children in cali, it does take forever. 
screw that!  my albuquerque friends know how i feel on this, i don't like
caravanning, and won't most times.  havasu in january is a fairly good
example for me.  a great trip, but took way too long to get there.  hope to
see you at octo.
good luck on ebay :)

&gt; podunk town going thru the SJ valley.  
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; from sacramento, plus driving to la (la-la land) from here (monterey).
