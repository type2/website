I've been known to.  Especially if I'm going to do a rebuild and replace
all the bearings.  In theory it's probably not  as good to whack the
bearings with a hammer blow, but I carry one on the road with me
because I figure the bearings will probably be ok.  I have a cheapo set of
3/4&quot; SAE sockets, breaker bars etc. i bought for $20 some years ago.  When
you get up in the 46mm size there is always a non-metric size that will
work. These are what I like to use if possible.  I have broken a couple of
Craftsman 1/2 inch breaker bars jumping on them to get 46mm axle nuts off.
