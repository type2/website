Subject: Re: [VB] spice rack top colour??

hm,   Seems that some are white with the grey lines like the tables and some 
are the fake wood.  Now I am wondering if the fake wood top is a 67 thing.  
Curiouser and curiouser....

Clara,
My spice rack has the fakey wood top with a piano hinge on the back edge, out 
far enough that the top stays open by itself.
