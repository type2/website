Subject: Re: [VB] Tool organization

Rex, I have two tool boxes, one is my &quot;road box&quot; that stays in the bus,
really has proven it's worth on many occasions, not just on my bus, but
other's as well.

My second box is my &quot;shop box&quot; which has all the specialty tools that I
would only use when the bus is in the shop.

Being an old shop teacher, both of my boxes are well organized with all
sockets on a peg board and seporate drawers for metric and american sizes.

If you're going to keep your shop tools in the shop, you might want to use a
peg board for all your tools, it will keep your tools handy to find and you
can tell when one is missing.
