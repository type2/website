My bad - I got confused.  I had someone offline asking me about

&gt; there fit! Pretty inconsistent. I have seen 2 other people making them, even
&gt; door panels, ! 1 of them is using a thin wood backing with a textured vinyl
&gt; to match the original gray panels, really nice stuff, I hope to have a set
&gt; of these here soon for evaluation, fit and finish, and will pass on this
&gt; persons name after I have seen the finished product.
