&gt;I thought Dormobile and Westfalia were mutually exclusive
&gt;conversions...

Thom,

There were 2 different Dormoblies...  Westfalia Werk put Dormobile
camper tops with Westfalia interiors for the European &amp; Canadian
markets and Martin Walter (Walker?) put Dormobile tops on buses
in England.

I am sending this from my home account, but you may forward it to the
list if you think it is important.

Dave
