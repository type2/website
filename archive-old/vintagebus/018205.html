Here are some quotes &quot;I then was going to take it to the Pebble 
Beach or 
Barrett Jackson Auction, where similar VW Buses have recently 
sold for $30K 
to $35K. &quot; heres another one, &quot;It also has the original front and rear 
seats, 
which are very rare and difficult to find.&quot;. And here is a knee 
slapper &quot;All 
the floor boards are very clean and rust-free, which includes the 
bellypans 
and all the special 23-window reinforcements in the engine bay.&quot;, If 
I am 
ignorant to the fact that deluxes have special reinforcements in the 
engine 
compartment, then my apologies.   And if it is true, I wanna see a 
pic.
