Subject: junkyard expedition
Mime-Version: 1.0


Listee John Hick and I went out to the sticks today to check out an old
junkyard with a few VW's.  There's not much left after all the pillaging
thru the years, but it was fun to wander around and take pix.  There's a 55
non-barndoor single cab that I'd LOVE to get, but the logistics of getting
it out are immense.  The bed on this truck is *beautiful*, and it's drier
than my 60 panel was!  

Lotsa unusual cars out there.  A hillman minx, desotos, a Kaiser Henry-J,
and various rocket-taillight american iron.  Lotsa big trucks,
duece-and-a-halfs, various tracked vehicles.  Tons of straight, dry
lagwagens.  Two identical ford crewcabs, 70's vintage.

Found a late-model cameper with a flawless interior.  Scored a stool out of
it.  There' s also an early 60's walk-thru, hatch-top westy, no interior
though. Still has the hatch.  Got the curtain rods, too.  And a MobilGas
ceramic sign from a gas pump.
