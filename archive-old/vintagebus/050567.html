Subject: Re: [VB] changing front beam

Hi Pete,
Definitely a good move to go to the later 64-67 front suspension.  20% bigger 
front brakes that feel more like 50% stronger.  Plus more rugged suspension 
parts that are easier to get.  Make sure your front shift linkage is not 
frozen together with rust, believe it or not this could easily be the hardest 
part of removing/replacing the entire front beam!  We stack a square pile of 
4x4&quot;s 4' long under the bus mid bay to act as jack stands which can not tip 
like jack stands can when you are pushing a heavy part in place such as a 
front beam in or tranny.  Remove all the control cables.  Unbolt the drag 
link, shocks, steering shock, and other pieces bolting the front end to the 
bus.  Get a friend to help you lower the old front suspension out and the new 
in.  To lighten you can and should remove the spindles by disconnecting the 
link pins, which should be taken apart anyway to inspect, clean out, make 
sure all outlets for the old grease are open and regrease.  Make sure to 
grease all threaded fasteners and coat the surfaces of the bus body and front 
beam where they bolt together before putting them back in to prevent future 
corrosion!!!!!   Eric&amp;Barb
