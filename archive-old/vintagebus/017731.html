Isn't what we fought that war for in the Gulf? I
personally don't believe that we really gave a damn
about Kuwait, and since the conservatives deny that it
was about raising Bush's poll numbers, that only
leaves oil, doesn't it?

When I went to fill up the other day, I caught myself
thinking &quot;Cool, only $1.29 a gallon.&quot; Then I realized
that I had become another one of the sheep, who have
already forgotten $0.79 gas less than a year ago. 

I am a firm believer in supply and demand. The cartels
are killing us by creating a false supply by not
producing at their maximum rate. Yes, oil companies
deserve to make a living, just like the rest of us,
but by supporting a false economy, they are eventually
dooming themselves, and by extension those of us who
enjoy the internal combustion engine, to extinction.
Maybe not in our lifetime, but it's certainly possible
in our children's. 

Mandatory bus content: Saw some beautiful splits and
bays at the SE Bug Fair in Toccoa, GA, this past
weekend. Can't wait to start work on my stuff again,
now that I've recovered from the hellish resto on the
'71 Super Beetle.

&gt; I realize we have cheeper gas than the Europeans,
&gt; but the oil companies
&gt; are trying very hard to make up the difference.
