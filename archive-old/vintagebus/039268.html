Subject: Jeff's '67 Deluxe HT Report
Date: Mon, 6 Jul 1998 06:27:32 -0700 

Well the time has come to report on my acquisition.

It's a '67 Deluxe walkthru hardtop with 6 pop-outs.
I'll post the VIN number, but it's an early '67 as both 
the VIN show and the lack of back-up lights.

A recent paint job resulted in a bright yellow
top and dark blue bottom.  Continuing the yellow theme,
the interior is also yellow with black panels, headliners,
and seats.  According to the M-plate, the original bus had been
Velvet green and white, and the engine bay attests to that.
Rear apron and hatch have been replaced from another
(red) bus, as shown by some chipped paint.

PO was planning on using it to gain attention to his
bicycle business in Tahoe, but decided to sell, for various 
reasons, storage during winter costs being one of them.
He put a LOT of money into this bus.

New headliner installed, all new window seals, new interior
panels (funky screws need to be replaced), new upholstery
covering front and rear seats, missing middle.

Black bumpers and wheels, chrome hupcaps.

Deluxe bumper trim not installed, but there.
Rear uprights and overriders there, not installed.
Painted to match, but PO had them painted BEFORE
getting sheared off overrider attach bolts tapped out.
Another task for another day.

An ice chunk fell onto it and generated a small dent on
the rear top and also taking out rear window with it,
so after getting it running, I'll need to take care of
rear window and dent.  Muffler, while not original style,
does exit out the right corner/side.

All deluxe trim included, Steering tight, brakes tight,
front end stuff supposedly replaced or checked.
I found steering damper un-installed though.

New tires, engine with 3K on it.  PO (and shop he
took it too) says distributor faulty, needs to be 
replaced with available 009.  Quick checking found
loose vacuum hose, functioning vacuum advance.
I'll address distributor after removing (see sand post).

Fuel pump question for any still here.
Copper line coming into pump fitting is loose, but
is not leaking while sitting there.  It turns and wiggles
at the pump.  I would think it shouldn't be loose at all.  
I was checking fuel lines in anticipation of replacement.

Engine number is B 61 69945, familiar to anyone?
Distributor numbers:
JFUR 4
0 231 115 078
113 905 205 AA
What Bosch points, cap, rotor does this take, and what
is the short name for this dist, and is it ok for this engine?

1600 dual port, Solex carb (where is carb designation
located on carb anyway?)  oil bath air cleaner.
