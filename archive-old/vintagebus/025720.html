Hi all-

Today my jaw dropped as I was coming back into town during
work from a construction project.  I live in Fort Bragg, CA
which is about 3 hours north of San Fran.  A few miles out
of town on Highway 1 I saw the familiar look of a splitty
heading my way in the opposite lane.  This isn't all to
unfamiliar here in hippyville, except this here splitty was
chestnut brown and titan red.  From what I know, these color
scheme came only on the early, early busses (read barndoor
and shortly thereafter).  Hmm...I thought, could it be a
barndoor???  300 ft. out I made out bullet turn signals.  I
was getting excited.  100 ft. out I noticed noticed
skylights and a hint of what could be a sunroof.  Things
were getting heated.  As it zipped by I noticed two
passengers with the driver on the left (yes Thom, your still
No. 1).  But what I was really after was a shot of the
back.  Could it be?  Could it be?  Bang! Yep, big ole engine
lid with tiny little bubble tail lights.  A 23 Window
Barndoor cruising up my freeway (well almost, we have only
about 10k residents and a Sh#! load of tourists.    My
glimpse of the BD told my it had original or a old repaint
as it was faded.  It looked to be in good condition and
complete.  I almost turned around and followed it, hoping
for the chance for some chat had they opted for a  stop by
the ocean for a looksy, but I figured it wouldn't as it was
heading away from town and probably made the necessary stops
then.

Sorry if I am a little too detailed here, but this is the
first time I've ever seen a barndoor, let alone a deluxe,
heading down any road besides one that lead to a show.
Who's BD is this?  Anyone know?  I know there can't be too
many faded deluxe BD of this color in these parts or this
continent for that matter.  Maybe no one knows.

This kinda makes you wonder how many non-IVBF's (Internet
Vintage Bus Freaks) own and drive really old busses just
because.   We know a lot about them because we read the
chat, go to the shows and mingle with other enthusiasts.
They may or may not know what they have on there hands as
they don't associate with the likes of us.    The &quot;only&quot;
connection to the VW world is stopping by the local grocery
and having it noticed and hear &quot;boy that's a really nice old
bus! or trying to get parts for it at the local FLAPS and
being sent away becouse its too old.  Then one day they
decide to sell and ask only $700 .......  because its &quot;it's
old, but still in really good condition&quot;.  Hmmm......  Maybe
I'll take a trip back down that direction tonight  :)
