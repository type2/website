Subject: Re: [VB] chime in

Merely send an email to:

vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

and it will appear on the list. If you wish to reply to a post, just hit
reply on your emailer program, type away and send it. NOTE: delete all
unnecessary text PLUS delete the trailer at the end, before sending. I do
it before writing my text reply. Be sure to delete the list trailer at the
bottom before sending , or your letter will be rejected. Excessive quoting
of the original post, in your reply, may also result in an auto-reject
from the list server. If that happens, just delete the trailer at the
bottom, plus unnecessary quoted material from the original post, and
resend it.
