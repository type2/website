Subject: Re: [VB] play in the steering 2

ya, also check out yr tires.  I had funky steering on my 65, and couldn't 
figure it out, when I got new tires it was suddenly loads better, turned out 
one of the back old tires had a tumor growing towards tehinside where I 
couldn't see it, and made the bus pull.
