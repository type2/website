&lt;&lt; 800 made huh? &gt;&gt;

I have heard 700 - 900 but in the three years I have been searching for them 
I have only found  10 and the highest production number I have found is 205.  
In fact, all of the ones I have found are between 70 &amp; 205.  Seems strange 
that only the early ones survived, should be the later ones surviving not the 
early ones...right?  Maybe the 700 - 900 number is wrong?  

Anyone out there owning or knowing of a Binz please contact me.  Would like 
to share production number information.  NEED A EUROPEAN CONTACT PLEASE!!!   
Also, specifically need the Binz tag number from John Howard's old Binz, and 
chassis number, Binz tag number, etc., from the Binz Dan Lawson had/has in 
Phoenix. 

Thanks,
Dan Kinsey
