We sell a vinyl bath panel at the hardware store I work at.  It's flimsy as
hell and it sucks to carry it and put in a customer's car however, I've
wondered about if it would make good kick panels.  The stuff is white as
snow so it would show up all the dirt but if you could get it in colors, it
would make GREAT durable non-warping panels.
