It just occurred to me....I am a studio engineer, and more often than not,
my reality comes down to the left/right level meters on a mixing console.
These meters indicate the final output of the board, and reflect the overall
mix to what is called the &quot;stereo buss&quot;.

Well, when you look at a splitty head on, you see what could be stylized VU
meters, with the needles where they should be....at about +2.  (Sorta in the
red, but not quite overdriving)

I oughta take this a step further...maybe some studio/VW bus(s) artwork or
somethin?

Building the spraybooth tomorrow.....if I'm really lucky, I'll have the top
sprayed by the end of Sunday!

Later,

Gene
