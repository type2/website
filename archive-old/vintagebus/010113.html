Hi Mark and listies

&gt;I too would really like to find a source for the original type curtains
&gt;for a late 60's to early 70's bus.  From what I hear this fabric is in
&gt;fairly high demand.  Is there any chance that some big bus parts
&gt;distributor might be willing to have some of the fabric custom made?
&gt;(Bus Depot, Bus Boys, PLF- are you out there - what about it?)

&gt;I, for one, would probably be willing to prepay for my share of the order
&gt;prior to manufacture.  How about anyone else?

I am always looking for this fabric as it is currently my most requested
item, but to my knowledge and any of my customers who have looked there is
no one out there making it.  I have found a manufacturer that has a plaid in
the same width but it is linen on a white base.  I have talked to them about
having it made with the correct colors for our westy needs. It is very
possible but I need to order 1000 yards which is currently out of PLFs
budget.  I plan on having this made as soon as finances permits but have no
date yet, until then I am offering their linen on white as a substitute as
many of my customers looking for original fabric who I have sent out looking
on their own have sent me some form of this linen plaid.  If anyone does
find a more suitable replacement please let me know as I am always looking.
Good luck on your search and keep me posted.
