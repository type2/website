Go to a large real hardware store. Ask for a product to remove water stains
from shower doors. If you get more than one choice, pick the one that says
it is OK to use on safety glass. We have a local product here in Fresno,
Calif called Sunny Brite and Sunny Brite II. Sunny Brite is not for safety
glass, II is. It works very well. I tried another brand called 'Water Stain
Remover'. It was a very runny liquid and you had to use good rubber gloves.
It was almost 100% acid.....Did not work as good as the Sunny Brite II
product.

&gt;     I am seeking advise about how to clean the glass in the 65 that I am
&gt; working on. The bus was pulled from a field here in Oklahoma after
&gt; sitting 28 years and the glass has a crusty coating on it. The coating
&gt; is a slight whitish hazing that resembles lime deposit in a shower.
&gt; I tried using some household cleaners with minimal success.
&gt; Is there a product or procedure(polishing, etc.?) that will remove the
&gt; coating and clear the glass up again?
