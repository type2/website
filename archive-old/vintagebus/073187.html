&gt; OK, how do you get a tie rod end out.  I removed the entire right or
&gt; passenger rod and both ends from the bus, but I can't get either end
&gt; to budge.  I've been using wd40 and am now trying heat.  When I
&gt; clamp it down in the vise and turn the end the rod wants to
&gt; twist....  Any ideas?  For a '66

so just to make sure I am following you. you have taken off the
retaining nut that holds the taperd end of the ball joint that
acutually goes into the holes on the bus? right? so you have in your
hand an entire tie rod end to end right? And you are trying to remove
the the entire ends w/ the ball joint, right? 

ok if all that is correct. is this tie rod the style that will not
adjust? if so that may be the problem. On my bus the drivers side is 3
pieces. a rod in the middle and 2 ends that have threaded ends that
allow you to adjust. but the other side is not adjustable, is this
perhaps the end you are trying to get off?
