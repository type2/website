Subject: Westy Interior 4 Sale

Hi..this is a SO-33/Moasic Westfalia Interior...correct for a `62-`64
Hatch top westy but will fit into any splits.

This interior was available in two ways from VW...as a Factory Hatch top
SO-33 camper.  But also as a &quot;Mosaic&quot; interior.  Which means that this
interior could be bought piece by piece or complete thru your VW Dealer
to retro fit into you standard, deluxe, panel any bus you had.  So it
could and would be considered correct in any panel, kombi, standard
micro, or deluxe bus!  I have Original VW documentation to show this
interior and state its purpose.

This interior is all wood._dot_decednt shape and very complete..here is the
chance to have a Westy with spending 10-15k on a nice hatch top!!

Asking $350 you pick it up.  $400 plus any and all shipping cost if I
have to ship.
