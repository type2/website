&gt;&lt;I think you guys miss the point.
&gt;
&gt;13mm wrenches aren't opinionated and overbearing.  Hoover is.  That's the
&gt;point. Taking it with a grain of salt only works for so long before the
&gt;real flavor begins to creep back in....

    You do not know what you are talking about.

    Weren't you the dickbrain who posted something inflammatory
    about a week and a half ago? I told you to go buy some St.
    John's Wort and knock back about two handfuls and THEN post?
