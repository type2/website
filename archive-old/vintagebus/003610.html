&gt;When you pull your shifter the locking plate underneeth has a hole in it in
a kinda &quot;D&quot; shape with two little walls, one per side.  &gt;How does this go in
there?  I can't quite figure that one out.

The reverse lockout plate goes with the longer, beveled wall with the walls
up and the beveled side to the passenger side.  This is where the ball goes
when you shift into reverse (pushing down, over to the left and back, makes
the shifter ball go to the right and forwards where the little bevel in the
plate is.
