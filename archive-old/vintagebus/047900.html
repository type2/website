So who is this BRL, and why is it on my dash?

p E-13, 2  of the transporter workshop manual pub by VW (you may have one pub
by Bentley)says
&quot;the USA version vehicles are equipped with an emergency light system.  An
emergency light relay and a switch on the instrument panel enable all the turn
indicator lights on the vehicle to be switched on simultaneously.&quot;

There is a picture of a dash w/switch for emergency light- the non lighting up
type switch, that comes with a BRL on the dash

THis implies to be it is a US spec thing

also,  p E-13, 3 says that the switch with the lightling up knob came as on
ch# 216 000 001, aug 2 1965

I thought there was a wiring diagram for the brl type emergency lights, but
can't find it now.  The difference between the original and the reprint of
this book is there are updated versions of parts of it, so there are a couple
of the E-13 sections.  So really I should state the date of issue of the
update to be clear about my source.

So, one would expect us spec 63-65s to have the brl, and the 66-67s to have
the lighting up knob.   A 65 with the lighting up knob is odd.    The lighting
up knob type switch is held in with the piece that screws into the switch
around the knob bit.    Does that 65 have the hole for the screw underneath?
Does it have a 9 pin blinker box?

     That is weird.  I have a red dash light on my 66.

Whats weird is my 66 Deeeluxxxe has the red knob nekt to the light 
switch. po replaced the light switch with  a toggle, which i replaced 
with a , drum roll.... an early porsche 911 switch. However no red
dash light seperate for the warning flasher,  it isintegral to the pull out 
knob. A 64 21 window that i am reinvestigating its worthiness for 
resto does have the red dash light. PO/66 also left a ignition switch 
dangling on the tray, fully die cast, no fit in de hole! Was given an 
early bug? ign. switch made of steel, sliced the mounting ear and re-
welded it and now have a fit in the pod of the 66. oh the joy!
