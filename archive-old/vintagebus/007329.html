Subject: November Sucks, my bus is Dead, doo dah doo dah
Date: Thu, 9 Nov 2000 10:13:45 -0600
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I trashed my motor coming to work this morning. My tranny gave out
yesterday, fourth gear became unusable so I've been cruising the Illinois
back roads in 3rd. I knew the strain would catch up with me but I took the
risk anyway. I love my bus, and I'd rather drive it than anything else, but
driving the bus in November in Illinois is a challenge. It was 25 years ago
this week that the Edmund Fitzgerald sank in the Great Lakes, prompting
Gordon Lightfoot's dreary song. It's only appropriate that the song is
dreary because the weather here is horrible. With no radio and only the
engine to listen to I sometimes develop these little scenarios while I'm
driving. So please don't think I'm losing it altogether when you read the
following:

1st Mate &quot;Capn, we're taking water over the nose. The parcel tray's
flooding.&quot;

Captain: &quot;Parcel tray's flooding, aye, remove all documents to the 2nd
chair&quot;

1st Mate: &quot;Capn, we're taking water through the plenum.&quot;

Captain: &quot;Secure the plenum.&quot;

1st Mate: Cap'n, the plenum is secured sir, she's not holding.&quot;

Captain: &quot;Damn, we're losing power, gotta turn this nose out of the wind&quot;

1st Mate: &quot;Can't do it Capn, we've gotta stay in our lane.&quot;

Captain: &quot;Ring the engine room - All ahead full.&quot;

1st Mate: &quot;Engine room says no more power, we're barely making 30 knots.&quot;

Captain: &quot;Ring the crew, tell them we're going down.&quot;

end of transmission, (and engine, and drive to work).
