Subject: [VB] Southwind Gas Heater on Ebay
Message-ID: &lt;0.3bc7ad12.255c2fbd_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Anyone ever see a SW heater like this one before[ Ebay item #196302427] ? I 
have one like it but in better shape . Its relatively small and mounts inside 
. I don,t know what time period it came from but I would guess before 50. 
Anyone have any info?      Stu  65 Dormo
