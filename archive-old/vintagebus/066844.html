&gt;-i think all your bulbs would burn out very quickly,

I once accidentally installed an 12 V stop/tail lamp (1157) in a 24 V
military truck.  It was really, really bright for maybe 10 seconds,
and then all the magic smoke went out of the bulb filament.

&gt;the wiper motor will fry pretty quickly-there was discussion about 
&gt;something to adjust voltage to the wiper motor-but there were problems
&gt;with doing that-which i can not remember.

You can install a resistor in the power lead to the wiper motor to
drop the voltage back down.  Apparently though some of the resistors
used for this are not very temperature-stable, so if you run the wipers
for a while, the resistor heats up and allows more voltage through to
the wiper motor and the wipers start to run faster and faster.

In general resistors work OK for relatively fixed loads like the wiper
motor but not so well for varying loads like a radio (current draw
depends on how loud you are playing it).  The right thing to use is
a voltage regulator IC, but they are sometimes hard to find in the
higher current ranges you need for VW accessories. 

There is a Library article with more notes on 6 V to 12 V conversions
at http://www.type2_dot_com/library/electris/wire6v12.htm .
