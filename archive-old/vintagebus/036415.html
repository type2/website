Subject: Fwd:  [VB] Powdercoating Engine Tin
Message-ID: &lt;7v4fn9$7vae_at_eGroups_dot_com&gt;

&lt;i have used OLYMPIC powder coating in santa ana, cal.
when i was doing 356 porsche resto's they came up with a color
called ronnie's black for the engine tin, this was basically
a satin black, not shinny or flat, but just right, it was matched
exactly off of some NOS porsche tin, and looked exactly as the 
paint would of, in concours judging this paint was excepted.

they are an excellent company, fast turn around, and they do
all the blasting etc., and are 1 of the few powder coating
companies that pre cooks the items to be painted to remove
all inpurities before paint.

their no#  714   979  2720
           2737 s  garney
           santa ana, cal   92707

hope this helps   ronnie    old volks home of az

ps, they have ovens big enough to do complete cars
a friend of mine had his whole 65 mustang (body) done
inside and out!!!!!!!!!

I'm looking for a consensus (ha, outta this group) on what is *correct*
for engine tin.  Obviously the engine tin was originally painted, so by
powdercoating it that automatically rules out correct.  But aside from
that, should the black be done in gloss or semi-gloss?  I've heard it
both ways from numerous experts, so I threw everything out the window
and decided to throw it to the list.

Gloss or Semi-Gloss, what say you?
