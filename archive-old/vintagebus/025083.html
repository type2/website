Yes, there IS a difference between Turn signal switches.  I ran into this
when I was resurrecting the Tinkertoy.  After ordering a couple switches
&gt;from various vendors I finally did my very best to clean the contacts in
my existing switch.  It now works really good except right rear turn
signal is a tad hard to find.  I saw little difference between the 2
switches, just a couple extra wires soldered to the 12V/1967 switch.  I
wonder if there's a listee out there clever enough with free electrons
running along the outer surface of a conductor to figure out the
difference and let the world know how simple it is to fix 6V switches to
fit a 67 Bus!

After all this typing I realized you were asking about HEADLIGHT switches
and not turn signal switches.  Oh well, my question still stands!

&gt; hey all,
&gt; i got some headlight assemblys this weekend and want to get the real
&gt; light switch working. i am assuming though that it doesn't work or it
&gt; would be connected. (yes, i did try hooking it up) i got al the wires
&gt; figured out except the grey one hooked up at 5 o'clock (if you are
&gt; looking at the back of the switch) is there a different switch for 6V
&gt; and 12V? that is probably why it's not working. there is a $.99
&gt; toggle working the lights now and i would like the parking lights and
&gt; dash lights to work too! i've gone through all my parts catalogs and
&gt; stuff and no switches. any ideas... an extra switch out there??
&gt; thanks a heap!
