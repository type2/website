     One thing that may help is slapping your glass.  Basically, you slap 
your glass with open hands and slap it down (you make need to wash you 
lubricate off the glass to get a grip).  This moves the glass down and gives 
you more room to pull your cord around the window, you can also slap sideways 
to center the window, if needed.  If you have trouble with the cord, slap 
that sucker again.  
     Just go slow, relax, if things get strange, take a break, chill and try 
again, or even start over.  After a few bus windows you'll get the hang of 
it.  
     If you really start to freak out, just think, you could be doing a Ghia 
window with moldings!!!
