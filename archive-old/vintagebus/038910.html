Subject: RE: [VB] gear ratios + ext oil cooler questions ..

Several tranny builders confirmed that not all 67s are automatically 4.12 R
and P, which is what I belived as well. I do not know if it was a monthly
production change late in year, or an option, which I don't believe it was.
I just had mine, a virgin 50k transaxle rebuilt with a new 4.12 (it did have
4.37, and the builder plus source of the trans claimed they strongly
beleived it was never opened. In fact the case was so rough, it had to be
replaced! Thjey also did the pinion bearing. I only found a hadnful of
builders that wanted to replace the pinion bearing. The one I gave the job
to claimed that is important on a bus, since the load the trans is often
under is tough on this bearing.
I am using this rig in a 1600 SP (pretty much stock, just counterweighted
crank, 14&quot; rims on 195/75/, in a 66 DLX. Aiming for 60-65 mph cruising
speed, with a .82 4th. The builders all did not recommend a 3.88 with this
engine and ANY loads. Perhpas with just you and very little in the bus, but
3rd gear will see more use to 40mph+.

&gt;  Dear list
&gt;  I have a 67 single-cab .
&gt;
&gt;  1) are my final ratios 0.82 / 4.37 / 1.26 ??
==========
I believe those would be what it came with. - no I think 67s came with a
4.12
r/p. However,  In the past 30+ years odds are the tranny has been out at
some
time, so there is no guarantee that is what you presently have.    If you
have big nuts (46mm) on the rear drums, it has a 99.9% chance of 1.26
reduction, if 36mm nuts 95% chance of 1.36 reduction.   There is a website
tells you how to jack up one wheel, mark a chalk line on the tire, tunr the
motor  and fuigure the gearing from the ratio engine turns to wheel turns.
there is also loads in the archives on gear ratios.

fwiw, the tranny that was in my 65 westy when I bought it was a 4.12 r/p
with
.82 4th and 1.26s- probably someone swapped the center section out of a bug,
flipping the r/p.
..........
&gt;  2) If so I am planing to swap 4.125 , my current engine is a 1.6 single
will
&gt;  it result worse ? I am not planing to load anything heavier than 500 kg
&gt;  (1100 pounds).
---------------
depends on what size tires you have.  If you have 14&quot;, the 4.12/.82/1.26
combo should be fine with a 1600.  It might lag if you use 15&quot; rims.  (any
comments?)

&gt;  3) Did anyone try an external oil cooler adapter which mounts under the
&gt;  original oilcooler ?. If so does it serially add the external cooler
after
&gt;  the original one or before it ?
------------
never tried it, no clue
...................
&gt;  4) The oil-temp seems to increase easly over 120 C ( 250 F) I am not
feeling
&gt;  happy with it , is it normal ?
------------
no, it is not normal.   Under what conditions does it do this?  driving
around town in regular stop/go/turn situartions?  If so double check all
your
fresh air tubes are hooked up properly etc, no rag in fan etc.   or on the
freeway?  ANd what speeds/rpms do you drive on the freeway?    Seems that
around 2600-2800 rpms is the best cooling speed.  2500 you run hotter.  3K
you  run hotter.  3500 you run hotter.   4K you run hotter.  You may want to
find out with a tach what you speeds are at 1500, 2500, 3k, 3500 in each
gear.  You dont have to install it permantly, just hook it up and drive with
it on the seat and a pad and paper maybe a friend to write it down.  Putting
a external cooler may be a bandaid

&gt;  5) Can 0.82 4th gear be fitted to a bug ? my bug has 0.92 with 3.88 ,
0.82
&gt;  can be cool with 1776 , 100 hp .
yes, you can fit a .82 4th in a bug.  and a .89 in a bus.  the center
section
is the same for swing axle bus or bug- your bus has bug part number on it.
a
3.88 tends to be in a 72 and a half and later super beetle, which has a
single side cover, not two like the earlier cases.  takes some mods to swap
parts over, but it can be done-   people do get 3.88 r/ps in their splitty
bus trannies for higher speeds (though the higher gearing will make a stock
1600 feel tired.
