Subject: 1960 Double Cab... 06-23-03

Got home very late from work tonight and ended up helping a neighbor 
lady who got locked out of her house. I ripped apart her doorknob 
then slapped an extra I had in the shop on in it's place. She was 
VERY happy......hope she was SUPPOSED to get in the 
house.....anyway.....

I figured out that the date stamped matched 15&quot; bus wheels I had been 
saving and bragging about for my '59 Single Cab turned out to not be 
matched at all! In fact, 2 were crow's feet wheels. Don't know how 
that happened...but wouldn't be the first time I got confused.

Good news is that made life much easier. I dropped 'em off on the way 
to work to get the tires yanked off. I had to call and have my wife 
pick them up for me because of working late, but she did it and they 
made it home. I brushed some phosphoric acid on them in the rusty 
spots and left them.

Now I can prep these wheels, paint them red, and get the NOS wide 
white walls mounted without having to mess with the ones on the 
truck. Once their done, I'll switch them out and still have a nice 
set of tires mounted on 15&quot; wheels...perfect for the double door 
panel!

Next I decided to get back into the wiring. Not much light left 
outside for tonight, so I went right to the headlights. A little 
testing here and cleaning/swapping wires there....boom...headlights 
worked! What a glorious site it was too. Those nice clean headlights 
lighting up that flat black nose and ultra shiney chrome emblem... 
this truck is really starting to look cool!

I checked the parking lights and they worked like a charm.

Next was the taillights. I connected the wires to the new housings 
and that did the trick. The taillights lit up that nice red against 
the flat black. Cool!

I checked the horn...nothing. Pulled it off and saw the wire wasn't 
connected. Crossed it and still no horn. I crawled under the bus and 
realized the problem....horn was missing! Looks like I need to buy a 
set of JC Whitney air horns for this sucker now... or maybe a Wolf 
Whistle horn would be more appropriate!

While under there I saw the brake light wires weren't connected. So I 
replaced on the ends and then hooked 'em up. They didn't work. 
Neither do any of the turn signals. In fact, the new flasher isn't 
even making noise. It's too dark now and so I'm back to the computer 
to print out the wiring diagram for this busses setup. That way I'll 
have it out there with me tommarrow.

So, some progress is better than no progress. I'm stoked that the 
electrical system is coming alive. A little more time and patience 
and I might get to start driving this thing here pretty soon!
