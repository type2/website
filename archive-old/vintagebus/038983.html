&gt; &gt; It doesn't leak, but braking is a little weird sometimes and takes an
&gt; &gt; extra pump to make the pedal firm (I've already flushed and bled it).
&gt; &gt; All wheel cylinders have been replaced or rebuilt, and the hoses are new.
&gt;
&gt; You don't mention if you replaced the drums.  A 32 year old car is bound to have
&gt; worn out the drums by now, and you could get new ones for about the same price as a
&gt; 67 master cylinder.  Just a thought before you replace stuff that might not be bad,
&gt; get a micrometer and check those drums, I'll bet you 10 bucks they are out of spec.

Nope, did that last year (and not all that many miles ago) when I
replaced or rebuilt all wheel-end parts of the brake system.  All of the
drums were well within spec, although the shoes were worn enough to be
worth replacing.

Good thought, though.
