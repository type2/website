Hi Jay,
Dependabilty of any year bus or vanagon, new to you depends on DPO/s 
adherance to maintanance and thier mechanic/s or lack of.  We have driven 
ACVWs daily for the past ten + years and mostly pre-1968 buses.  Best to 
inspect throughly and repack all bearings in the suspension, and steering and 
change all oils.  A newly rebuilt engine goes along way to relibilty of the 
early buses.  Get the Bentley reprint of the 63-67 VW bus shop manual and a 
later bus or bug Bentley for the engine if you run a later model engine.  
Most of all start reading and studing these manuals and the Type2 Library so 
you can start to become knowledgable of what you are driving!
  As for the gas heaters they were an accessory from 1955 up till today and 
soyou will either need to find a bus/vanagon with one installed or find a 
heater shop that can supply you with a complete gas heater to install.  Since 
you live out in the winter season salt induced rust belt you might be better 
off driving a modern water cooled VW during the winter and using your bus 
during the non-salt seasons.   Eric&amp;Barb
