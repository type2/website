Howdy-hi Oly and all, I used a magnetic heater on the oil pan of my
Rabbit diesel for a couple seasons and while it worked reasonably well,
it cannot compare to the heater I now have in the &quot;frost plug&quot; for
heating the engine and ease of starting in cold weather. No &quot;frost
plugs&quot; in our beloved air cooleds and I don't know where you could get
the magnetic heater to stick as it needs a relatively flat, ferrous
metal surface to cling to. I also always removed it before starting off,
don't need that clunking down the road behind you, I have enough trouble
keeping all the parts on the vehicle as it is ;^) Hope this helped Mark,
Saginaw Mi
