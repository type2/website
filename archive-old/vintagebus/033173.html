 Speaking of front emblems, how the heck do you get the clip on the top one?  
Get you 2 y/o to put her hand up there?  I'm
 not a contortionist.

have a friend hold the emblem against the nose of the bus where the stud is 
you are putting the clip on.   Your kick panels are out, right?   you just 
reach up there and push the clip on, yes it's tight, but doable.   If you are 
one of these 6 ft guys with big hand it may be useful to get someone with 
smaller hands to do it.  My friend Julie is 5ft 1in and found it easy to do 
things like that when she worked on her bus.

 Also, I saw mentioned the other day putting insulation in a bus.  I know 
they make fiberglass insulation sealed in those
 bags, but is it thin enough to fit behind the panels?
 Anyone have a better suggestion? Should the insulation be sealed off behind 
a plastic sheet like on the front doors?
 Thanks

I used the shiny reflective bubble wrap stuff from Home Depot in my 65 westy. 
  No water retention,  no fiberglas particles to stick in your skin.   very 
nice.  Works too.
