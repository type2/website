&gt; Bob,  
&gt; Thanks for the post. As a EE, I agree with everything you say. As
you say ,
&gt; calling the Pertronix a true electronic system is probably incorrect
as it
&gt; uses a traditional coil to supply the spark.

This is probably a dumb question, but I'm just an ME so I can get away
with it:

If a &quot;true&quot; electronic ignition doesn't use a coil (transformer) to
jack up the voltage, how does it do it?
