&gt; You never know who you will find on the list.  Hi I'm Erik and I am
also a
&gt; service manager at a tire shop.

Ah, an expert.  Now I have to watch what I say... :)

&gt; 205/75r14 tires are technically only 2 cm
&gt; wider than a 185/75r14and about 3/4 of an inch taller.  As tire
nomenclature
&gt; goes the first number describes how wide a tire is in mm.

That's the tread width, correct?  The sidewall width seems to vary
quite a bit, and I've noted that my 195/75R14 tires are actually
narrower in the sidewall than my 185R14s  The former tires have
relatively flat sidewalls while the latter have a pronounced bulge.

&gt; For those of us who run a metric tire ie
&gt; 165r15 there is no middle number and the sidewall percentage is
considered to
&gt; be 82.

OK, I thought it was 85.  Live and learn!
