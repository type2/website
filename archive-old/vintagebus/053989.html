&gt; A while back I asked a question on a Friday about
&gt; who
&gt; had ever left Vice Grips on a clutch cable.  Got a

&gt; fact
&gt; that I asked the wrong question.  He said I should
&gt; have wondered &quot;how many times&quot; some of us had done
&gt; so.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, in working on my new 1957 Singlecab from
&gt; Nevada,
&gt; I found a set that might have been on there since
&gt; the
&gt; fifties!  The patina of rust matches the truck, and
&gt; it's a style of Vice Grips that I haven't seen in
&gt; years.  Anybody ever found an older set?

hey JP,
i have two (one on each side)on my clutch cable that
have been there for a year but they're so rusty they
look like they were original equipment. they come in
handy when working on stuff like the heater cables.
just pop one off and put it back when you're done. i
should keep more tools under there!
