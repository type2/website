Jeffrey,

I just got my  guide tonight, and while looking at it I also noticed the
65/66 date annomoly (sp?).  Check out the bottom of page 21. 
I have a US delevery (well tourist delevery anyway UT) 65 and mine still
has the church key.  I believe the confusion comes from the difference
between when the UK/European model year changed and when the change
happened for US delivery busses.  

So, for European/UK busses, the pushbutton happened in 65 and for US
busses it came in 66.  BTW this difference in model year was true with
bugs as well, just read any book written in the UK re: VWs and you'll
hear them talk about 1967 as the year the big change came about.  Here
in the US it was 1968 that it happened.
