Subject: Re: [VB] &quot;Restorations, rebuilds, customs and DNA

wow, all this talk about what to call it has me thinking a bit (hey
you in back quit laughing, I do think some times)

Seems to me that a lot of the people very strict with their sense of
restoration are not looking so much to exclude others, but to make
sure recognition is given to their kind. A lot of these vehicles are
seen only at shows. While it might not be across the board completely,
I suspect that the main purpose of these vehicles being seen only
there is to win. That win could be whatever, trophies, respect, ooohs
and aaahhs, but to win at something none the less.

If we assume that most of this segment of the VW crowd is looking to
win, we can also assume that they will want something they can
control. Restoration classes give them that. They are only competing
against themselves (sorta like a dog show). Not at the whim of the
crowd. It's possible to quantify this type of class. Such phrases as
&quot;nope that bumper was only offered after 55, so it shouldn't be on
that 54&quot; or &quot;That isn't the correct year saphire radio&quot; mean something
to these guys and gives them a goal to shoot for.

While it's not me to try to restore a bus to complete OG I can easily
see why someone would be perturbed. In their eyes all the work put
into their ride is getting shortchanged from their point of view.
Suddenly this one ride which actually looks more pleasing to the eye
w/ some nice goodies, is shadowing the ride our OG man spent years
digging through swap meets trying to find that one year part. 

Which means, I like camping and driving my bus a hell of a lot more
than shows :)
