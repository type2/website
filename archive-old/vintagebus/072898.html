Subject: Re: [VB] Friday: Buses in Charlie's Angels 2

Yep, I saw those also. Demi's ride is a Ferarri Enzo, btw...          
Just saw Diamonds Are Forever last night (James Bond) which must have 
come out in the late 60's. There are a lot of busses in the           
background, especially in the airport scenes.                         
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
&gt; I'm not sure if anyone else posted this earlier, but Amber &amp; I saw  
CA2 last                                                              
&gt; weekend and in the beach scene...&quot;the&quot; beach scene, ya              
know...Cameron Diaz,                                                  
&gt; Demi Moore, bikinis, surfing, yeah &lt;nods&gt;...Demi's character leaves 
in                                                                    
&gt; (what I think is) a Lamborghini and there's a wide shot of the      
parking lot                                                           
&gt; as she shoots down between the cars.  Lower right corner of the     
frame,                                                                
&gt; there's a lowered green &amp; white double cab in the foreground.  Is   
that                                                                  
&gt; anyone's?  It kinda looks like Tony Christina's but I'm not         
&gt; certain.   Later, when Cameron's character is talking to the        
assassin dude                                                         
&gt; (whose driving a late 60s Camaro?), they're standing right next to a
real                                                                  
&gt; nice red &amp; white 21-Window!  Anyone's?                              
&gt;
