&gt; I was doing some tune up stuff on &quot;Babcia&quot; (1600 SP) today in preparation for
&gt; Everybus. After the valve adjustment I started her up and found the dwell to
&gt; be 55. I did not really want to mess with it as the points are a nightmare to
&gt; set on that thing. The plate were the points attach is bent slightly making
&gt; fine adjustment very difficult. The dizzy is a rebuilt unit (Bosch 0231 137
&gt; 009 vacuum advance only) and it came that way but I noticed it too late to
&gt; return it.

hey ric. the reason for the dwell that changes is the shaft actually
is wobbling a bit in it's position. sometimes it wobbles toward the
points and this causes it to stay open longer. other times it does the
opposite and this makes the dwell increase as the points remain closed
longer. I'll grab the 009 from steph's bug w/ the pertronix in it and
we can see what happens to babcia w/ that in it, if you want.
