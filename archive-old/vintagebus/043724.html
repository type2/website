&gt;&gt;What is the unloaded length of a stock oil pressure spring which controls 
&gt;&gt;the oil going to the oil cooler?  Is it different after 1970 with the
&gt;&gt;dual pressure relief system?

The 1969 model year (printed August 1968) &quot;Without Guesswork&quot; manual
has two specs for the &quot;pressure relief&quot; spring: one for the 30 hp (DIN)
engine (early Beetles I believe) and one for every other engine up to
that time.  The 30 hp spec is 52 to 53 mm unloaded.  The everything-else
spec is 24 mm with a 7.6 kg load.  These are both new specs; no wear
limits are given.  See the page yourself at 
http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/docs/wog69/017.png .

The 1973 model (October 1972) &quot;Without Guesswork&quot; has more specs.  It
just covers the type 1 1600 and type 4 1700 engines.  The &quot;pressure
relief&quot; spring is 44.1 mm with a 5.6-7.3 kg load (1600, type 1) and
39.0 mm with a 6.8-8.8 kg load (1700, type 4).  The &quot;pressure control&quot;
spring is 20.2 mm with a 3.1-3.8 kg load (1600, type 1) and 26.0 mm
with a 1.7-2.0 kg load (1700, type 4).  Again these are new specs
with no wear limits given.  See the page yourself at
http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/docs/wog72/010_m.png .

The above manuals are brought to you by the Obsolete Air-Cooled
Documentation Project - for more info (and more manuals!) see

hosting these!
