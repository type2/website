Subject: Goodbye from the backup site..Mark and Ol'No Name




_at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at_ I enjoyed this email very much..In any large group of people 
there are going to be &quot;JTB's&quot; and others like him who do post off topic or 
just plain mean attacks on other people here..just hate mail sent in to try 
and cause pain.I have email blocked those people a along time ago ...I dont 
even get their post back at my main site...But here at my backup site they 
still get thru and I have sent in my feelings about them.Time to unsubscribe 
this backup site with hopes that David R...will start to weed out those that 
send in hate mail..those that wait to bash good people.After David R's 
emails I cant stay on this list knowing he is at the top with his finger on 
the &quot;Banned button&quot;....Like I have said before I have enjoyed my visit for 
the most part but it is looking like some terrorist types(JTB among others) 
are lurking about this list just waiting to bash us over our heads.I wish 
most of you well and it's looking like you can take alot more #_at_$% than I 
can from &quot;Those&quot; people.....Later Real Bus People....Mark and Ol' No Name 
from the backup site......_at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at_

&gt;Subject: [VB] Delete key/Ratbastards
&gt;Date: Sat, 29 Sep 2001 10:11:29 -0400
&gt;
&gt;...with bus list content!
&gt;
&gt;This month I have received 2928 messages - many from the VB list, 1061 of
&gt;them have been deleted unread - again, many from the VB list.  There are
&gt;people on this list who every time they post I read it - Ellis, NQ, JP,
&gt;Kyle, Ronnie, John Howard, Everett and a few others.  Some of them I read
&gt;knowing I might disagree with some of what they have to say but I either
&gt;like their writing style or have appreciate their perspective on the VW
&gt;community.  There are other folks that almost without exception I delete
&gt;their messages without reading .  There are also subject headings that I
&gt;read every time or delete every time.  If it says Binz in the subject I'll
&gt;be reading it.  However, how many times has the list covered correct tire
&gt;size?  How about how to lower/raise a bus?  M-code questions?  Probably 3 
&gt;or
&gt;4 times a year for as many years as the list has been around.  Straight to
&gt;delete for me.  If I'm not mistaken, &quot;search the archives first before
&gt;posting&quot; or something to that effect is in the charter as well.  I don't 
&gt;see
&gt;many flames flying about tire size...and you never will from me because I
&gt;know how to use my delete key.
&gt;
&gt;Please note: EVERYONE posting about the terrorist attacks/US response has
&gt;tried to make it evident what the message was about in the subject line.
&gt;You saw the subject line, knew what the message was about, knew you didn't
&gt;want to read it, then read it anyway.  You read it knowing you didn't want
&gt;to then whined about doing it.  Yes, you are the smart ones.
&gt;
&gt;There is a list moderator.  That is Thom as far as I know.  If you don't
&gt;like the &quot;ratbastard&quot; or any other topic ***Pmail*** Thom.  By posting 
&gt;&quot;Kill
&gt;this thread&quot; you create another off topic post and create tension on the
&gt;list.
&gt;
&gt;One last thing - JTB, who ever you are, why don't you post your name?  I'm
&gt;sure there are those who would like to know who you are the next time they
&gt;meet you at a VW event.  Take ownership of your posts and your flames.
&gt;

&gt;Stock height Binz with correct tire size and no M-code plate
