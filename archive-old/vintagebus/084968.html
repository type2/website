Subject: Re: To buy or not to buy: '59 Double-door panel walk-through

Oh yea, here is a link to some pics i took - sorry some of them are a little
blurry.

And he is asking $2k - I know he would go a little lower than that, and he
is also contemplating trading some of my web site design work, so I would
say somewhere between 1500 and 1700.....

&gt; I have always wanted a double door, (already passed on a '57 DD riviera
&gt; and have kicked myself multiple times for passing) and a friend of mine has
&gt; a '59 DD panel - no windows cut - of course needs some body sections
&gt; replaced: passenger rear corner up to the belt line (PO's really bad
&gt; attempt), the front steps and dogleg area, and of course a few little
&gt; sections of the sill are all the way through. Also, it appears they either
&gt; cut to put '67 front turn signals in, or replaced the nose. However, the
bus
&gt; was parked in '84 - and was only driven around the block when my friend got
&gt; the bus.
&gt;
&gt; The dash is totally original - but the ashtray is really rusted out -
&gt; kinda weird as its JUST the ashtray. Also, since the bus is a walk-through
-
&gt; I have never seen one of these - are these really that rare?
&gt;
&gt; BTW I am not worried about the rust replacement, I know i can do that if i
&gt; take my time, and of course the mechanical, I am not worried about, but I
&gt; would also want to put a bed in the back, and not sure if this would be the
&gt; bus for me, especially if I would devalue the bus at all if I was to put
&gt; camper interior in it......opinions?
