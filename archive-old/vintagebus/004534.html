&gt; I'm dirtier from head to toe than a one eyed junkyard scalawag and I don't
&gt; care.  After a month and a half of peddling my a$$ around town via
bicycle, I
&gt; got the rebuilt transaxle installed and out for a test drive today (hmm..
it's
&gt; 1:15am.  make that yesterday and this morning.)
&gt;
&gt; This was the trans that I dropped in the double cab a year ago to get the
city
&gt; off of my back.  Got 2000 miles on it and 1st gear broke.  Since Rancho
&gt; Performance Transaxles is just a short drive down the freeway from me, I
took
&gt; the trans down there and had it fixed and built up to withstand the torque
from
&gt; the 2L type IV that I converted to upright.
&gt;
&gt; Since I was working alone, I thought I'd give a try at putting the engine
and
&gt; trans in as a bolted together unit. and see how that would work out.  It
was
&gt; interesting and with two people, one to lift and one to push, it would
have gone
&gt; much easier, but I was able to get it all in place without any problems.
&gt;
&gt; The CIS FI that I adapted to the engine, just bolted in and the engine
fired
&gt; right up.  Talk about noisy lifters, they sounded like a sherman tank
clanking
&gt; away behind me until the lifters pumped up and quieted down.
&gt;
&gt; In the morning, I have to bolt the bumper in place, fix a broken wire on
the
&gt; taillight and off we go to Irvine to catch my daughter's volleyball
tournament.
&gt;
&gt; I guess I better go and start washing the grin off my face.
&gt;
