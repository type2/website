Hi Dave,
We agree totally with this especially with a unknown used or even new 
distributor.  This way one can actually test where both the minimuim and full 
advance are.  A distributor must at least reach 20 degrees BTDC _at_ 2,000 RPM 
and top out at 28-30 degrees BTDC at the most _at_ 3,000 to 4,000 RPM.
In other words, you set a distributor for 0 degrees (TDC) staticly.  Then for 
instance find that it runs 15 degrees _at_ 2,000 RPM and 23 degrees _at_ full 
advance.  So you need at the least to set the distributor at 5 degrees BTDC 
staticly so it runs 20 degrees _at_ 2,000 RPM and 28 degrees BTDC full advance, 
or on up to 7 degrees BTDC for an advance of 22 degrees BTDC _at_ 2,000 RPM and 
30 degrees BTDC full advance.  Just make sure not to run the engine at high 
RPMs for more than needed to get the testing job done and the less time the 
better.  To do this it is best to temporaryly set up a tachometer in the 
engine compartment and work the throttle by hand at the carburator.  Eric&amp;Barb
