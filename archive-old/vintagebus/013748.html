Subject: [VB] More speaker reconditioning
Message-ID: &lt;19991025015141.7061.qmail_at_nwcst323_dot_netaddress_dot_usa_dot_net&gt;

I did an experiment that I think improves on the speaker reconditioning
procedure.  This should make stronger speakers.

Instead of using thinned paint as suggested before, use thinned woodworking
glue instead!  just start mixing some water into some Elmers woodworking glue
until it gets watery enough to soak the paper fibers of the speaker.  Use the
same small paint brush (artist's brush) and paint the paper with it on both
sides until it is saturated.  Let dry thoroughly.  Then paint it with regular
paint - enamel or laquer.

By my estimation, the speaker paper seems to be harder than the ones I did
with just paint.  Since paint isn't really structural like glue is, I think
that this might be a better way.

The speaker seems to be able to belt out some bass just like before.  I was
concerned that painting the &quot;accordian&quot; surround would limit the throw of the
cone.  This procedure seems to work well with limited throw speakers such as
the ones found in VWs.

Give it a try!
