i can't seem to find her email address, but i have her phone number. it's
888-836-2247. if i remember right, the best time to call is after 7pm. i
have ordered a set of these and they are excellent. i think they go for $125
a pair, or $75 a piece. i'd buy two. other wise, you can check out
http://www.dormobile_dot_com. they have a rather large list of replacement parts
for VW dormobiles.
