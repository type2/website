last nite my lovely wife and went out to get a burger at sonic, went a few
miles down the road and i noticed a resistance/power loss, like i was
running out of gas, i have about 500 miles on this 1600 dp , just installed
it a month ago,  anyway as we get to the traffic light right before the gas
station i hear a rattle tap tap, not the mighty thor type hammer banging rod
knock sound, but a tapity tap, like a screw driver orsomething,
my wife made a joke about chitty chitty bang bang, ha ha, i didnt laugh,
so we pull in to the station and its getting worse, i checked the engine
compartment , nothing wierd, checked to see if there was anything in the
fan, cranked it up again , woh turned it off again, sounds like its coming
from the left, so i popped off the valve cover, and  a washer falls out, and
i look up and the rocker arm has fallen almost all the way off the #4 side
of the rocker arm assy!!!!!!!
aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh, what in the ****? i almost went into shock, i found both
washers and the clip and stuck it back on there and adjusted it a little
loose as the engine was warm , got my gas and drove off, wow what a
difference an extra cylinder makes!
That really should not have happened on a new engine! I only drove it about
5 miles like that, but im wondering if this is going to cause more problems,
and if i should look into returning the engine???
i appreciate any comments on this,
