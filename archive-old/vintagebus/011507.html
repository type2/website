Subject: Trip Reports Suck--NOT!!
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Yea, I guess reading about people having a good time in thier  Volkswagens, traveling and enjoying the sheer joy of of crossing a mountain range or the entire country  ( Which I did in my 59' Bus, wanna hear about it?) can get boring to some folks, but I enjoy everyone of these trip posts.    I never get tired of hearing about some lost treasure found in a barn or at a yard sale, I myself have made some great scores at the local Goodwill store.  These posts are part of the enjoyment of owning and living with a VW!
  Peace, Love, and Shawn have you driven a Ford latley?
                                Maybe you should buy one?
         Mr. Bubble Head
Happy owner of 14 Volkswagens that are driven, enjoyed, and posted about!!!!
