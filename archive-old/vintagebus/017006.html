Noticed a late model Vanagon along the road home the
other day and had to flip a b*tch and go check it out.
Looked at it both Wednesday and Thursday, tired to
calculate a chess move but am in absolutely no
position, on more than one front, to buy additional
vehicles.
Wholesaler bought it not knowing VWs. Advertised
it/priced it as a &quot;Vanagon&quot; and didn't know AWD until
I accidentally let it slip assuming that he was all
over it...

Damn, potential quick turn profit left untapped. Kelly
blue book calls it $4500 as &quot;trade in value&quot; even with
the mileage. Advertised at $2600 in AutoTrader on-line
but will take $2K cash. &lt;major sigh!!!&gt; See photo in
the AutoTrader_dot_com website match up phone# in this
message.  So in the Kharmic sense here it is as found.

1987 VanagonGL Synchro 14&quot;
Maroon/ grey interior

*ZERO* rust

174k miles, A/C, 5 speed manual trans
7 seat &lt;full middle&gt; and Zbed in rear
Interior very nice.
Bumpers minorly tweaked but you know youre gunna
install bullbars! =)
New tires, acceptible whl covers
Motor looks really clean and OEM
CVs looks good/sound good/dont leak
Paint a little scratched, minor blem on wheel arch rt
rr psgr side. Clear coat on roof is going. Cover it
with a badboy full length rack and forget about it for
this price!
Just emissioned all lights etc all A-OK 
Call Mark (602) 318-4288 cell
Mesa, AZ Tell him that &quot;the guy with the old white
VWbus&quot; put it on the internet.

Either that or contact me asap and give $8500.00 cash
for my EZ camper as it sits and I'll go over right now
and nab it...
