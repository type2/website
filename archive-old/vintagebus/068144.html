Subject: roof rack question

Does anyone know where i can get a rack like this one? Even a manufacturpor 
so i can keep it in my mind if i see one ill know thats the one i like?

(preferably without buying the bus that its on, although its probably not a 
bad deal..)

More bus content. My bus (http://members.aol_dot_com/jcwfla/bus.jpg) is kinda 
coming along, finnally done with mcse and most of cisco training so ill have 
more time to spend on it. 1835 (yes i know wrong motor) is finnaly in and 
hooked up but will not start (havent troubleshooted it yet), one of new axle 
boots is leaking (bah), wolfgang master cylinder kit (for 71 mc) is in and 
went in perfectly, but i need to bleed brakes. New fuse box is in and went 
perfect (well, it was a minor fire actually, its all fine now). Still need 
to do front shift bushing too, not sure if thats going to be a nightmare, 
checked the archive, seems so. Im still looking for an ambulance fan switch 
and or fans, anyone? (in other words i have the plate and thats it..). Cant 
wait to get it on the road and drive it vs. look at it in the garage...
