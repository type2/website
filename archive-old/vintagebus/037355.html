Subject: Are anti-sway and camber comp worth while?
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

I am going to be reassembling the 64 soon and I was wondering if it was worth
it to install an anti sway bar in the front and a camber compensator in the
rear?  I intend to use it as a daily driver.   

Should the anti-sway be professionally installed, or can someone explain to me
what goes into tuning one?

Is the camber compensator for the back better than a rear anti-sway?  

Thanks so much!
