Subject: Re: [VB] i need spindals!

I have the spindles from my '63 Sundial that I removed to put on lowered
ones, but they have got to be expensive.

When I was getting ready to change them out, I wanted to find a pair of
cheap ones to send in as cores and keep mine, just in case. I did alot of
shopping and I am absolutely certain there are no cheap ones out there. Your
best bet is probably a boneyard.
