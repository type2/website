&gt;&gt;I have that drain tube on my 66 DLX. There is also a brakcet holding
the
&gt;&gt;splash pans to body as you describe. Now to clean the thig up and put
it
&gt;&gt;back on.
&gt;&gt;AL

My '67 Deluxe has the drain tube.

If I understand the bracket correctly, there are two (one left and one
right), because the holes in them are not centered.  They're curved to
match where the bumper bolts to the body.  I cut inner tube rubber and
glued it to the inside of the curve so it wouldn't scratch the body
paint when securing the whole bumper/splash pan assembly.
