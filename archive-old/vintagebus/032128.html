&lt;&lt; Oh yeah, does anyone have any good tricks for removing that bolt? &gt;&gt;

Hi Josh,
Yes!  Take the pressed in nut plate out of the engine case.  Then just use a 
nut and bolt there.  We weld a L-shaped piece of metal to the head of the 
bolt to go up and over the tranny bell housing to lock the bolt from turning 
on pre-1968 trannies.  Also have recently started to drill and tap to machine 
screws into the bellhousing on either side of this L-shaped bracket and 
hooked up two light springs to the bracket to pull the bolt to the rear.  So 
far it has worked great!  Just install the engine and the bolt pops right out 
for the nut.  On dogouse cooling systems we leave off the last two cooler 
exhaust shell/tube tins to allow hand installing the upper left engine 
mounting nut on.   Eric&amp;Barb
