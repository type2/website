&gt; When I got to work I noticed one of the two pea-shooters was gone ... Could it
&gt; be another bolt that the Mechanics From Hell forgot to tighten ??

The peashooters are held in place by two pinch clamps that indeed can work
loose.  I've had one get repeatedly loose until I replaced the clamp.

Of course, on a bus you shouldn't have peashooters.  You should have a
proper single tip exhaust.
