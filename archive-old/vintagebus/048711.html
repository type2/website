Subject: Oil pump removal...

After taking a look at the tool in the Bentley for removing the oil 
pump, I decided to try and make one. I welded one up and slapped it 
on. all was good until parts of the tool started bending. It 
eventually came loose from not being strong enough at the shaft that 
goes into the oil channels on the sides of the pump. I am happy that 
my welds held just fine. Oh well.

I think tommarrow I'll give Tom's idea a shot. I had thought about 
doing that and probably should have went ahead with it instead of 
wasting time making a tool that I can probably buy for less than $10. 
I'm just having fun tearing the engine apart and it's the 
weekend...you know?

I think I've got a lot of sick time built up at work. Come to think 
of it, I'm not feeling to good. I think I might be catching 
something. cough...cough....cough.....   ;)
