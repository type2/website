I recovered two campers a few years back that were so mossy you could not even tell that the Westy was two tone. I sprayed the whole thing down with Simple Green full strength. Make sure it is a cool day or the bus is in the shade. Let the Simple Green sit and then scrub it off. This took all of the moss off.
hope this helps,
