&gt;Our brakes are *embarrassingly* loud.
&gt;&gt;The answer that I got from the shop is that due to the
&gt;lack of asbestos and increased metal content in the
&gt;shoes &quot;they all howl like that&quot;.
&gt;


I have never had loud brakes on a bus. NEVER. Counting off the top of my 
head:
4 67's a 63, a 60, a 64, two 70's, a 68, 2 69's.

thats 12 busses without that problem. Something is wrong.
