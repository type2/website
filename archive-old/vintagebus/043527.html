&gt;Here's the equivalent procedure done the redneck army georgia way

Hold my beer and watch this!  :)

&gt;(at this point you need to make sure the front of the bus isn't on
&gt;jackstands or you will knock it off and ruin 2 hubcaps and bend your
&gt;jackstands,

How did you ruin the hubcaps?  Were they sitting on the ground already?

&gt;while screaming for your bus but somehow managing not to spill
&gt;your beer-ask me how I know this).

I'm afraid to...

&gt;(some may not want to try this at home)

Kind of reminds me of what my Dad did to his '74 Bug when he first
got it.  It sat outside for about two years with the e-brake on, and
when he released it, the right rear wheel still wouldn't move (shoes
stuck to drum).  Dad's solution?  Put it in first, let out clutch,
put it in reverse, let out clutch, etc... it was impressive watching
that corner of the car rise up in the air... finally there was a
BANG! as the shoes unstuck and it was fine after that.
