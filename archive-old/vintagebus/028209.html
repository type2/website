Last time I saw this bus (2000 VW Classic weekend) it was still held
together with a bunch of clamps.  I don't really know Charlie Hammill but
I think he's showin' off and havin' fun with his *huge* stash of NOS
parts.  I know I wouldn't have the b_at_lls to start welding all those
perfect *original* panels together.  All I know is that I would give an
arm to have just one rear ribbed bumper....NOS or not!!!  Mr. Hammill must
have like 10 of them (NOS of course!).

&gt; I know that you are free to do what you want with your parts, but doesn't
&gt; that seem like a waste of NOS panels? I know it would be cool to say &quot;this is
&gt; my brand new 50's-60's bus built from all NOS replacement panels&quot; It seems
&gt; that there way too many rare/special/wrecked buses that need panels
&gt; replaced.... spread the wealth, I guess?
