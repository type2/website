Well, OK. Let's just say it's great that it's a VW bus at all. We'll sort
things out when I'll bring her home. I thought for a moment that it is a
kombi converted by one of the shops. There were so many of them then.
Hopefully I'll be able to tell more by the M-codes. For now, thanks for
all the input. I'll take her on the road soon and you all be first to
find out how it went.
