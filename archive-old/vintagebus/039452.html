I would have preferred to see a Ford Festiva or some such other disposable 
car treated this way.  Yeah it was a bug... but is was an air cooled VW Bug 
... by simple(ton) extension, the general public sees no difference between 
them.

Bus content: I am sorry for the loss of Joe and my sympathies to his family 
and friends.

To further this thread: if there are no jigs are their any drawings, plans 
or specifications for a Bus towbar then.  This is something that has been on 
my list since we bought my 63 Panel.
