I would like to suggest that the individual who originally posted
this question check out some books written by a man named Laurence Meredith.
One of my favorites is &quot;Original VW Bus&quot;. To get information on your
specific
vehicle look for you M codes

My 2 cents:
I just wanted to reiterate that the book &quot;Original VW Bus&quot; is a GREAT tool
for finding out what is what and what should be where!  I'm a bus newbie
with a '65 Samba, and this book has become my Bus Bible.  I have discovered
what things I'm missing and been pleasantly surprised and the pieces and
parts I DO actually already have.  Just a &quot;book report&quot; --- it is worth
every penny and you can buy it online thrugh Amazon_dot_com.  Don't even have to
leave home! :-)
