anyone know the best way to &quot;un-stuck&quot; a stuck motor?  Also, what is the 
best thing to do after I get it to turn over?  Maybe someone has a little 
list to follow when trying to get a stuck motor to run,
(what kind of motor you ask? a 1949 ford 4 cyl for our military jeep)
Any help is appriciated,

Thanks,
Matt
