Subject: Re: Battery hold down

When I got my '64, I think the battery was lashed down with a bungee
cord.  The fixed end of the strap was still secured to the outboard
part of the floor, but the strap had rusted through about 6-8&quot; (15-20 cm)
from the floor.  The other half of the strap, with the latch, was in
the usual &quot;random parts&quot; box that came with the Bus.  The hook on the
inboard part of the floor was also still there.  The floor itself was
not scary, but not perfect either.

What I did: Removed the original stud for the outboard end.  I used a
piece of cardboard to make a template, and cut out a piece of 1/4&quot; or
3/8&quot; (6-9 mm) plywood to fit on the floor.  I drilled a hole in it where
the fixed end of the strap goes and cut a square notch around the hook.
I put a long bolt with a big fender washer up through the bottom to hold
down the fixed end of the strap - I can adjust the strap length by moving
the nut and locknut up and down on this long bolt.  I spliced the strap
itself back together with two lengths of pipe hanger strap (mild steel,
not too great, I know) and some bolts.  I made a battery cover out of
two lengths of 1x2 stood on their 1&quot; side along the long edges of the
battery, with a piece of the same plywood over the top.  I had to
notch the 1x2s to clear the battery terminals.

The net effect is that I can put the strap over the battery+cover and
latch it down with the original latch.  After a couple of initial
adjustments, the battery has pretty well stayed put.  YMMV.
