Subject: Re: [VB] Early bus VIN number question

ya- Dan has a point there-  is the number you wrote the one from the engine 
compartment?  the one in the engine room is the VIN
 
one is a very late 58, as July 31st/ VIN 375 089 is the model year change
 ( or is it 384  875 at the bumper change?)   Does the later one have a body 
number stamped behind the passenger side of the front seat?   It may have an 
m code tag.

The earlier one, it doesn't have a tube for the shift rod, right?   Under the 
bus.
The earlier one should have the rare flat decklid, while the later one the 
mid 58 through later 64 decklid


I am a bit confused by fascination of wanting factory codes.  That earlier 
bus has codes for standard with sunroof, ambulance divider, from what you 
say.   8 seater- then it would have code for 2/3 middle seat (9 seaters has 
three rows of seats for three- meaning full front seat and full middle seat- 
7 seater has walkthrough front seat (hard to fit ambulance divider) and 2/3 
middle seat.)

Sounds like a couple neat buses,   any pics?

 These are CHASIS numbers, the one from the engine compartment, not the BODY
 number which is behind the front seat on the passenger side.  You'll need to
 verify those are the numbers you sent.

 Subject: [VB] Early bus VIN number question
 
 
 Hi all,
    I have two early type 2's  both are registered as 1958, one with VIN #
 295464 and the other 369810.  They are supposedly early '58 both have
 pressed bumpers, the later is a camper.
 
   The 295464 bus has factory sunroof, ambulance partition, no skylights, and
 is an 8 passenger bus with standard trim.  Can anyone help determine the
 year of this one, possibly the option codes, or does anyone know where I can
 find this information?
 
 Any help would be greatly appreciated.
