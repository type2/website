Subject: Re: [VB] Baywindow exhaust question

----- Original Message ----- 
&gt; im getting the rusty westy ready to drive this winter and am going to get
a
&gt; gas heater. my question is, are their any extractor type systems available
&gt; for the bay 2.0L that will eliminate the heater boxes?
&gt;

Remmele, but I doubt you want an $1800 exhaust on your bus. :-)

I'd just leave the stock heaterboxes in place and run a regular Bugpack
header. I did that with my 79 westy and was able to pick up a couple mpg's
over the stock muffler.
