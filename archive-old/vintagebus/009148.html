&gt;Backrest maybe. Seat cushion, no. The rear seat cushion has a section in
the middle front that drops down about 3 in. from the rest of the frame. The
front doesn't have this. Just try swapping the backrests, that will tell the
story there.
&gt;
Are you saying that normal bench front seat bottoms have completely flat
frames while Crew Cab back bench bottoms have a curved section in the frame
with the dropped down section being most of the front of the frame?

Hope that made sense,
Everett Barnes
