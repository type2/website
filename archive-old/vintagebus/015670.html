OK, here's the latest scoop on the hubcap.  It turns out my connection is 
extremely busy at this point in time to accept the hubcap and transfer it on 
to another person.  Sooo.. it is now been stalled in Jacksonville, FLA for 
the past month and now I need to find another willing soul to carry on the 
cap. Any takers in north Florida/ South Georgia?  Perhaps, someone who will 
be attending the Buses at the Beach show, Jacksonville Beach, on Saturday 
April 8th?  This show is located just over the dunes to the ocean and will 
be held in conjuction with the Greater Atlantic Seafood Festival.  There 
will several thousand people mulling around the show lot looking over your 
splits.  Swapping parts in front of your bus is encouraged and entry fee I 
believe is $5.  Some of the proceeds will be donated the Duval county 
chapter of the Surfrider Foundation.  HELP!HELP!HELP!
Drive 'Em!
