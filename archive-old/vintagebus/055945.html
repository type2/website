Subject: somebody stop me

You know your buying too many buses when you start adding up how many times
you've rented a tow dolly. The bad part about liveing on an Island is you
pay extra for the length of the dolly both ways when you take the ferry to
the mainland. Hmm, the wheels start to turn, what about a ramptruck or
rollback. Then the worst possible thing happens. You find one at a
reasonable price. Well if it works out I'm gonna look at a early tiltcab
ramptruck, best thing is it even has a split windshield. Then there'll be
just no stopping me ; )
