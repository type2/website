Wolfgag's spindles require a new tie rod assembly to replace the static one.
The result is two adjustable tie rods instead of the one that is stock. I
guess you could get by with the original tie rod end that came with the bus,
but I changed them all out.

&gt; The free stuff I recieved form Dre was great. It is good to see some part
&gt; move like that. Saturday I got free torsion bars with spring plates from a
&gt; yard I went too, in very nice shape. Bus even sat right, so I can go
without
&gt; much tweaking from stock angle. It is good to know that it isn't all about
&gt; money here, since I need so much damn stuff, not that I expect to get much
&gt; for free.
&gt; I wish I had some 'extra' stuff to help out, but perhaps someday...Right
now
&gt; I am begging yards for OEM bolts and nuts for spares, since I have now
extra
&gt; fasteners around....
&gt; Logistics look like a maiden voyage might be sometime late August, so I
&gt; expect Sept... :) I pick up my engine and my trans should be done mid
&gt; August. Planning on a crunch then... Right now scrubbing undercarriage
(wooo
&gt; fun).
&gt;
&gt; Spindle q: Do the lowered spindles require a different tie rod end? I have
&gt; Wolfgang ones, and they are going going gone in acouple weeks for a stock
&gt; set, jsut want to be well prepared, so I don't wait for parts.
