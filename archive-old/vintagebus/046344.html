I too think that tool is impresive. but i dont have one and i cant see 
getting one any time soon(not enough disposible cash on hand)
but being that i have not run into anything that i couldnt do with my other 
tools, i'm not too upset.

Maybe its just that i'm a mechanic on large equipment and have alot off LARGE 
tools.       I usually put a 36mm 6point 3/4 socket on it with the 3/4 air 
gun and 
one shot it comes off, with no bangin of the nut, no damage.

I agree with you on the axle nuts, if there really rusted in ther a 3/4 gun 
would run 
the possiblity of damaging the threads. 
I use a slapper wrench witch has a thick base on it to hit with a hammer , to 
break it loose and then use the small gun.
And for tieghtening i have a torque wrench that goes up to 250ft.lbs.

Also lubricating the rusty nut and threads with (power lube) and then heating 
up the nut just a little bit (it lets the lube really get in there) does alot 
for getting them off.

Well enough ramblings.  gotta ta get back to work (beem removal and tranny 
removal)
