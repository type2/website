Somehow I think the culture was different then.  Were there any
enthusiasts around in 50 when the first bus came out?  In 55, when 
the &quot;new&quot; bus came out, what was the reaction?  &quot;Ug - look at tha
dam eyebrow thing!  And that tiny engine lid!&quot; (Jerry? Any insight?)  
Same for '68, when the bay window hit the scene.  Or 80, when the 
vanagon was thrust upon the country.  I don't remember any hullabaloo 
about the Eurovan.

All of the previous generation demarcations represented major 
technological innovations which necessitated the change in 
appearance to house said innovations.  The difference between that
and the &quot;new bus&quot; is the new bus doesn't appear to be offering
anything new under the sun technology wise, but rather is 
a purely stylistic and marketing ploy.  Same goes for the New Beetle;
the major changes, ie split-to-oval, oval to big-window, were
in response to customer feedback - a want for bigger engines
and better rearward vision.  The new beetle, and new bus, are
an attempt to tell the customer what they want, and it worked
with the new beetle.

Another thing to consider: this is just the one-off show prototype;
the end result, like most proto-show cars, will probably not
look anything like it.  The new beetle is one of the few concept
cars which didn't change much between the auto show and production,
but it did lose a few cool feature on the way (like the androgonyous
fenders)
