Subject: oil leak!!!!
Date: Sun, 23 Jul 2000 23:22:29 EST
Mime-Version: 1.0

I discovered a new leak on my oil filter system. It had no leaks before but 
now is leaking from the metal fittings on the end of the manufactured hoses.

MY Question,

Should I try to get a hose or have on made and fix it or should I try the 
pump that JCW sells that has the filter right on the side? Are these any 
good? Am I better off with the hose system that puts the filter in the 
engine compartmen? I'm not asking about conviencence, which is a better 
setup.

Thanks for the advice.

Scott
