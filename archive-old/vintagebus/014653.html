Are we ready? I finished installing my sapphire radio in the Westy today and 
have the evening planned.  The kids are farmed out and the bus is in the 
yard with extension cord electric heat.  At the stroke of midnight the only 
thing I love more than my busses  and I will be sitting in the bus at the 
table, listening to to the am radio, eating a chocolate moonpie and drinking 
a millenium edition coca cola.  Life is good.  I vividly remember fifth 
grade in 1967 having to write about where I wanted to be on the coming of 
the new millenium.  I don't remember what I wrote, but it had to do with 
being in the place I like the best with the one I love the most.  If it were 
to all end tonight, I would have succeeded in my dreams.  So happiness to 
all and to all a bus to keep it in.
