&gt;  I started gettin nailed by
&gt; barndoor and vintage bus owners, saying I needed to be sent to a mental
&gt; institution for cutting the &quot;trademark&quot; barndoor peak.

Who paid for *your* Bus?

In my opinion when it's your money (Bus) you can do to it what *you* want.
Adding an accessory is a fine reason to cut VW metal.

I've been blasted more than once for some of the off the wall accessories I've
added to my VW's, but  at the same time I enjoy them and I could care less what
the matching date stamped wheels, &quot;original&quot; interior, 100% correct, never been
painted Vintage Nazis think. It's my money, it's my VW, and I'll do with it what
I want................

Greg
