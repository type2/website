It's great to have the list back up again, thank you to all who make it 
happen.

For those who are interested, I e-mailed Rep. Delvin with questions about HB 
3217 and this is what I got.

&lt;&lt; HB 3217 died during the 1999 Oregon Legislative Session.  Representative 
Devlin has no plans to reintroduce this bill in future Legislative Sessions.

 &lt;&lt; Prohibit the registration of ALL MOTOR VEHICLES MANUFACTURED BEFORE 1981
  &gt; beginning Jan. 1, 2010.  The bill would allow the registration of antique
  &gt; or special interest vehicles that HAVE PASSED UNSPECIFIED EMISSIONS &gt;&gt;
