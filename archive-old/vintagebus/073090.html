Subject: Hard Luck Truck

If it's not one thing, it's another.  Yesterday, a semi was
delivering trusses in my neighborhood, and when he turned the
corner at the end of my street, he caught the back end of the load 
on the rearmost hoop on my double cab.  This bent the hell
out of the hoops, and bent the tailgate as well.

So, now I have to come up with a damage estimate for the hoops
and the tailgate.  Any ideas?  It's not like I can just waltz 
into Niello and get a parts quote...  Is the guy who was doing
the repro hoops still in business?  I sent him an email and got
no response.

Thom
