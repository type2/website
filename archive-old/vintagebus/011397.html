Ellis for &quot;prez&quot;, I say........

        Finally, some kind soul has sent me the missing link to the puzzle
that I have been searching high and low for almost 3 years now.   I spent
lunchtime throwing together a little shrine to the info sent to me.   Many
b_at_stard non-Westy camper owners out there now know who there daddy
is....thanks to Mr. Ellis.

        Check out
http://ourworld_dot_compuserve_dot_com/homepages/JJRodgers1/ez.html to see what the
&quot;EZ Camper&quot;  looks like.  Many of us that originally thought we had the
infamous &quot;Sundial&quot; camper now have a reference at how our &quot;EZ Campers&quot;
should be restored.  I wonder if Mr. Ellis realizes the impact of his
donation????.........all of us &quot;Single-Paned, Hacked Panel-Van&quot; owners are
stepping a new direction in one swoop of a scan.

Now....all together....lets change them autosigs!

Thanks again Rusty Van Bondo!
