Don't grab the tools and start driving yet. 
Karl (aufever_at_prodigy_dot_net) saw it the Sunday after Thanksgiving at a pick-n-pull in Bakersfield, CA on an 80's Vanogon with a Devon interior. Side hinge, nice canvas he says. So if you want to convert a Vanogon to a Dormobile type moonraker, here's your chance. He and/or I may go down (100 miles) next weekend and could pick it up or take pics.
