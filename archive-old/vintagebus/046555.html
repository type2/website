 &lt;&lt; What does everyone use for going to the yard and cutting body panels off

 Hi Pete,
 Anything that cuts metal and is allowed in the wrecking yard.  Eric&amp;Barb
 
  &gt;&gt;

I have a gas power concrete saw with a metal cutting blade- cut through a bus 
like butter. - kinda like a chainsaw except a big cutting wheel instead of 
the chain.  bulky though.
