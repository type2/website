Subject: '59 preparation questions?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Ok guys---
I'm going w/ the metal man Neil (bodywork guy doing the bus) to  get the 
paint for the '59 panel on wednesday! In preparation for reassembly, i need 
some help. After a year of on and off bodywork/prep it's so close!  Now I 
know that these questions are very particular, but, I want to do it right. 
Now for the questions:

-My bus originally didn't come w/ an interior rearview mirror, but, I'm 
adding one for safety (mirror is from a '63). We have to drill the holes and 
I'm wondering what size screw is used in these holes? what type?
-What size screw is used for the drivers visor? Also, any tips on unsticking 
the visor (a bit of rust) moving mechanism on a pressboard visor?
-Where do you bench seat guys mount your seat belts (i need to mount two I 
got from WW up front?
-What size screw is used to mount the cab divider? (is it the same as the 
interior panels?)does anyone have those 2 little corner rubber pieces? Are 
they neccessary?
-The is the grey color on the cab divider the same that I should paint the 
interior? Should I get a match off of this?


Thanks alot ---  Sorry for the rambling but this is the only place I know of 
to get this info!!!  I wouldn't have even gotten this far without the list so 
all of your help is appreciated!

Thanks again
-Pete
