Subject: Re: [VB] Greyhound shipping

I got lucky and the &quot;primitive stupidity&quot; of greyhound shipping from 
a small town worked in my favor. According to the &quot;rules&quot; on the web, 
my big package should have costs around $75 dollars. When i got 
there, the good 'ol boy working the counter weighed it while holding 
it to keep it from falling off the scale, obviously making it 
lighter. Then he measured it, which I think he wasn't too accurate on 
either. Then he asked where I wanted to ship it. I told him, 
expecting him to start plugging numbers into a computer. Instead, he 
broke out a VERY worn book and started flipping through it and taking 
notes. When all was done, the shipping ended up being $32!!!!!!! So 
see, there can be a good side to the dorks in charge.
