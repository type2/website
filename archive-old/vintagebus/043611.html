&gt;I'm having a problem with my turn signals and hazards on the Westy.
&gt;I've checked the wiring and it all seems to be connected correctly.
&gt;The behavior is that the turn signals work now, but flash twice as
&gt;fast as the hazards (I think because I do not have lights connected
&gt;in back yet).  The hazards flash at a normal speed, but no power is
&gt;sent to the rear lights. [...] There is power to the rear lights when
&gt;using the turn signals, but not the hazards.

Do your brake lights work?  Is the turn signal switch hooked up
correctly and working right?

When you signal a turn, the appropriate rear light is connected to
49a (the flash output from the 9-prong box) by the turn signal
switch.  The other rear light is connected to 54f (the brake output
from the 9-prong box) so it acts as a brake light.  

When the hazards are on, the 9-prong box connects 54f to 49a, so
both rear lights flash.  If the turn signal switch is off, both
rear lights are connected to 54f.  If it's in either turn position,
one light is connected to 49a and the other is connected to 54f,
but since these are both connected inside the 9-prong box, the
effect is the same.

Check the black/purple stripe wire from 54f on the 9-prong box to
54St on the turn signal switch.  With hazards off, this wire should
only have power when the brakes are on.  With hazards on, this
wire should pulse on and off in time with the front signals.
If this is not the case, the trouble is probably in the 9-prong box,
but if this is OK, it's probably your turn signal switch.

Or, for a full checkout on the turn signal switch, start at the &quot;To
test the rear lights...&quot; paragraph in the write up and run that
paragraph and the next one.

Good luck!
